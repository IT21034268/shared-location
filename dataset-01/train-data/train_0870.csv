4,Good book,"I received this book in a very timely manner and in good shape! I had to buy it for a college course for extra credit. I thought it would be boring, but it's actually extremely good and relates all the topics we've been learning to real world scenarios."
3,Better than I thought,"I am an undergrad in a business program and I had to buy this for an accounting class. I was skeptical because my teacher said that it was a novel, how can accounting possibly be interesting in a novel? The author does a good job of making what could be a very dry topic into something much more interesting, I was pleasantly surprised."
4,Great overall book!!,"Sure, this book is targeted to managers in production, but the insights are equally applicable to consultants, bankers, or anyone else who deals with processes in their business routine.I found this book highly entertaining. I was pulled into the problems facing the title character, and enjoyed the process of working through the answers.If you like novels which impart a great deal of wisdom, this is a perfect book. It is not dry like many of its counterparts in the business section. Regardless of how applicable you find it to your business, you will not regret the time spent in these pages.My only complaint is the ending. It seems the author was rushed by the publisher to come to a hasty conclusion. I feel like I just finished part one of a two part book. Where is the smooth ending? The book lost a star for this reason alone."
3,one long story,"I had to read this book for a class a while back and it is one long story. The story was great and was mainly about what the goal of business was and removing bottlenecks and stuff...but it was long! So if you like learning in a long round-about and storybook way, then this is for you. If you need to read this for school, get the audio tapes...trust me."
2,"An effective reminder of the basics, but nothing more","Just finished reading the book for an MBA class and found the book to be effective in reminding readers of elements to keep in mind when working towards effective production. Nevertheless, I came away from the book feeling that Goldratt knew his theory would only run about twenty pages of text if written in plain layman form and decided to turn it into a 340 page novel in order to have enough pages to get a publishing deal. I also felt that Goldratt's followup at the end of the book (""My Saga"") seems to be written merely as a defensive explanation as to why his theory failed to work in some cases. That is not the intention of the piece, I'm sure; but that is the reality of what is said there. Ultimately, in trying to ease concerns about failures with the system, Goldratt leaves the reader with a feeling that perhaps his theory is not worth the trouble implementing."
1,Never Received this product due to UPS failed delivery,Unfortunately I never received this product as requested on 07/28 by paying extra $17 for urgent delivery. So contacted UPS to resend back to Origin Destination. I got frustated for two days sitting at home to receive this product and the end result is it is not in my hand.
3,Fascinating and Compelling,"I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I thought it was very entertaining and interesting. However, the theories should not be taken too seriously, but as a starting point to solving a problem. Goldratt brilliantly wrote a dull theory into a very interesting novel. This book does definitely appeal to workaholic managers who have to balance their home life with their work."
4,the goal...links operations with strategy,"The goal is an interesting book that shows how having a clear ""goal"" and ""disciplined thinking"" can help operational managers to avoid the label...""cant see the big picture"".The goal inspires managers to have the courage to say so when they do see the bigger picture!"
3,Duh,"I thought that The Goal, while providing a useful reiteration of common sense ideas, was, overall, written at a level for fifth graders. I felt patronized by Goldratt's approach...the plot was weak to say the least. The book presented good ideas, but would be better suited to a high-school economics class than a CEO's library."
3,Love or Money,"No doubt more staying power than other improvement books with much more power, like ""Gemba Kaizen"" or ""Japanese Manufacturing Techniques."" It's been out over 15 years now and still stays in the top 500 of Amazon Books all the time. Makes me wonder if we're reading it for the Theory of Constraints, or do we just want to see how Alex makes out with his love life??"
4,The most oddly compelling novel.,"It's all about business, in story form. Very creative, and, very importantly, readable.I guess this book is tailored to factory production, but the ideas presented can be used elsewhere."
5,Good information: Easy and enjoyable to read,"Harris Semiconductor put Goldratt's Theory of Constraints to work and achieved outstanding results. See ""Leading the Way to Competitive Excellence: The Harris Mountaintop Case Study,"" available from Amazon.com. This book cites ""The Goal,"" also ""The Race"" and ""Critical Chain.""I also enjoyed ""The Goal"" on cassette tape (also available from Amazon.com).William A. Levinson, P.E."
5,Great book,One of if not the best business book I have ever read! This book had immediate impact. If you are involved with lean and/or 6 sigma in any way read this book. It will change the way you think about constraints.
4,Great for Ops,"Bottleneck. Lead Time. Throughput. These are terms that you're probably familiar if you work in operations, or are studying it. This book makes those terms and many others come to life. Highly recommended for students and those who are constantly seeking to improve themselves.PS: Jonah was right about The Goal!!!"
5,it's really the only GOAL!,"""The Goal"" by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. The Goal is a manufacturing novel, about a plant manager who is trying to figure out ways to run his plant better so that it can stay open. As a novel, it may not win a Nobel prize for literature, but as a way of putting some manufacturing ideas into understandable terminology, it does very well."
5,Great Business Reading & Inspiration to Take a New Look,"This book is a necessary part of the learning process for anyone who wonders how really great people and really efficient methods can still result in chaos and delay. It's not often that business reading is structured as fiction. Eliyahu Goldratt shows an estute knowledge of the constraints present in most business learning with his innovative approach. While this book will not step you through the learning process or hold your hand for implementation of its ideas, it will certainly frame your understanding and prepare you to take those steps."
4,"A ""Must Read"" for anyone who deals with processes","Sure, this book is targeted to managers in production, but the insights are equally applicable to consultants, bankers, or anyone else who deals with processes in their business routine.I found this book highly entertaining. I was pulled into the problems facing the title character, and enjoyed the process of working through the answers.If you like novels which impart a great deal of wisdom, this is a perfect book. It is not dry like many of its counterparts in the business section. Regardless of how applicable you find it to your business, you will not regret the time spent in these pages.My only complaint is the ending. It seems the author was rushed by the publisher to come to a hasty conclusion. I feel like I just finished part one of a two part book. Where is the smooth ending? The book lost a star for this reason alone.john.grounds@sirjohnathon.com"
4,More than just a theory,"The Goal is a self help book that does focus on the Theory of Constraints, yet it also provides information and ideas for problem solving and finding solutions for any problem, which I believe was Goldratt's main purpose in writing this book. If Goldratt just wanted to write text about the Theory of Constraints he could have done so without an elaborate plot and descriptive dialogue. This is why I believe he wants the reader to get more out of this book than just this particular theory. Goldratt wants the reader to believe that he or she can turn around a plant just as Alex did by being proactive and utilizing outside resources."
5,Good Read for students: a real world perspective,"This book was a great read. It was very informative of the business management processes and it gave a real world perspective on things. Being a student, you always wonder when you are going to actually learn the stuff you are taught in school. This book was an eye opener. I found the majority of my accounting vocabulary in it which gave me a look at how it actually applies to a business versus a word problem on a test. I think all students should have the opportunity to read more books like this for classes.There are some things you just can't teach in the classroom. This book gives a little insight to that as far as some business etiquette, etc. I definitely recommend this book to others, especially teachers and students who need a little more reality in between all those boring notes you have to take."
3,Useful as a Preview for Studying Management,"I read this book a few years ago, and am currently starting serious study of project management. If I had written this review right after reading it, I may even have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately, the story structure makes it harder to remember the useful details, and my current reading has shown ""The Goal"" to be rather derivative and nowhere near as original as claimed.But it is a readable and effective preview for further study. Or as one reviewer put it, for a review."
4,"Good information, but wordy","This was an interesting and engaging read. The focus is to show how to improve throughput of products to customers versus focusing on improving efficiency as a way to business success. It touches on the concepts of lean manufacturing (try ""Lean Thinking"" - an excellent book). The ideas are great, but wrapping them up in the life story of the plant manager is a mixed blessing. It moves the story along, but the subplot of his rocky marriage is tedious and takes focus away from the main point of the book. The anecdotal nature of the book also clouds some key points."
4,A Question of the goal,What's Alex's fate if his plant can not get enough orders or his wife has an affair?
4,Great book - reminds you to always remember the fundamentals,"This book teaches something very simple: always remember your goal. Entertainingly disguised as a novel, this book presents a manufacturing operation gone awry. Managers are short-sightedly cutting costs, measuring ``efficiencies,'' etc., until one manager remembers the whole point of the plant: to make money. Using this as a starting point, he revolutionizes the operation of the plant. The book lucidly presents the basic stuff about managing constraints in the factory, but the material is crammed in too tightly at the end - some material is just too complex to fit into a novel."
4,"The Brother years 5 stars, Early Beach Boys 3 stars","Its nice to see a book like this devoted to the Beach boys, they definitely needed one. That being said, this one can be topped, but its OK as the first stab anybody has taken into written a day by day story of the boys. Most of the research is taken from studio logs, but apparently not many could be found for the early (and best) Beach boys albums. While the book is some 350 pages, less that 1/4 is devoted to the years prior to 1966, and the rest of the book for the years 1966-1974. If you want a detail analysis of the early beach boys, you may need to look somewhere else. But for the Brother Years, this is very good. The book is not pricey and includes many photos. A revised edition would be great in a few years."
4,Beach Boys,"I haven't much to say about this book other than it is exhaustive in its research and timetables the bands career spanning many decades. Interesting tidbits surface, too many to go into detail here. It helps being a very big fan of the Beach Boys to really appreciate the ups and downs of ""America's Band"" in this book. Take a look, you just may find what you're looking for."
2,Definitive ? No.,"I bought this book at the Royal Festival Hall before a Brian Wilson show, summer 2004, flicked it open - and immediately, big problem: the social security number of pretty much everyone who ever played on a Beach Boys record 1961-1968 is printed.Reading more, later and at leisure, another big problem emerged - the bulk of the diary is composed of the work of other writers, both on the web and in print media, copied almost word for word and without adequate credit (and yes, here I'll confess a vested interest - the post 1976 year summaries are largely lifted from my own BB website, uncredited of course).That said, it's a reasonable overview of the band 1961-1976, and there are many excellent new photos... but there's also much inaccurate information, many myths are repromoted. So, definitive ? Not by a long chalk."
5,Still I Dream Of It...,"A work of unbelievable effort. I can only imagine the painstaking efforts it took to piece this marvelous historical monument together. The Beach Boys well deserve the attention this volume has given them. While most of the 60's and 70's supergroups have faded historically (Beatles, Who, and the Stones who should have quit over 20 years ago) the Beach Boys musical legacy has lived on. This book provides an excellent non-biased perception of the ups and downs that befell probably the most interesting musical group of all time, as well as profiling their most gifted and troubled leader, Brian Wilson. One cannot read the protions of this book dealing with late 1966 and early 1967 and hope that somehow the outcome of SMiLE is different. Not only does this book chronicle the Beach Boys careers, but also the relevant ""goings-on"" of the times. An enduring band and an enduring legacy now documented for all to learn from."
2,Boring and lacking new information,"Its a boring document that provides little insight into the band. Its just a listing of their tour dates. There is no narrative of the bands growth, fights, impact that Brian had on the band both when he was playing with them, and when he decided to quit touring. Its kind of a rip-off"
5,Wonderful 12-step Devotional,This devotional book has 30 devotions for each of the 12 steps. This is basically one year of daily devotions with Scripture readings and related 12-step thoughts. It really helps one have a great habit of daily devotion that links the Bible and the 12 Steps. A great travel devotional for those in recovery to keep on the path daily as well. It goes well with the Recovery Bible.
5,So helpful and encouraging!,My husband uses it every day. He runs a Celebrate Recovery chapter. He has been reading me some of it and it is really great. It helps so much when times are tough. He knows others who this devotional is really helping.
1,not what I thought,"Her explaination of the moves were good, but I was looking for something more repititous..more like an ""do it with me"" instruction and not a ""here is what to do""(only one time)I learned what I had to do, but I didn't have the creativity to put something together with just the few moves she showed me.I think something more like a ""workout"" bellydance would be good for me....then at least I could get a ""real"" feel of what I was doing."
3,A good but expensive choice for beginners,I think Mara is a good dancer and teacher; She has a very clear way of teaching and all...but this tape is too short. Mara's bellydancing tape I and II should be just one tape!Besides she dosn't even mention about torso movements like flutter or belly roll. I prefer that classic magical motion by Atea.
1,Amateur,"I would not recommend these videos- they are done like a homevideo (style.) The quality is not very good, it is not professionally done. This is not a comment toward the dancer, it is just relaying the quality of the video style. If you want professional and a video that you can see properly etc...Try the Neena and Veena collection."
2,This video is a ...,"For only 30 minutes of instruction, the price of this video is ... . The production quality and instruction are adequate, not anything exceptional to merit such a high price for such a short video. I have not seen her other 2 videos, but since they are all only 30 minutes, it seems as if she could have put them all on the same video. I don't mind a short workout or a brief taste of the dance, as some other bellydance videos and other workout videos do, but tell us what we are getting. I felt this information was concealed and therefore, I felt ... ."
1,I was wating more from this video,"I can tell it was mistake to order this video . You can`t see really how to do the moves . If never did it befor , this tape not the bast you need to get"

2,cheaply made but fixable,"This product did not work right out of the box. It heated up fine but no fog. I checked the things the manual said to check with no luck. The pump didn't seem to be pulling any insecticide up into the tube. Seeing it looked pretty simple, I unscrewed the brass fitting at the end of the tube that pulls the insecticide into the burner. Inside is a small ball bearing that acts as a ball valve, and a spring. I suspect the spring was either misaligned or the brass fitting was screwed in too tightly to allow the valve to function properly. I replaced the components, screwed the brass fitting back on, and the pump now functioned fine. I still have the fogger, but only because I can't find an inexpensive alternative that performs any better."
3,Good,The book was pretty good. I do like the author. But it did get a little too much that she(the main character) was so noisy.
1,Very slow painful start,"I cannot believe i purchased this book. it was a very slow painful start, extremely descriptive and wordy. Did not hold my interest, as such did not finish."
4,A Shocker!,"Burke tells an exciting story in a book that is hard to put down. I was unaware of Teddy's sexual and otherwise illegal exploits, so if you were like me, this book will prove to be very informative. Burke reveals much about the character of the man for whom he worked and worshipped."
2,How does the author really benefit from writing this book?,"The question I felt was never satisfactorily answered by the author is, ""Why write the book?"" Painful as it must have been for Burke to remove his rose-tinted glasses, the benefit of exorcising his demons can hardly have offset the personal and professional liability he created. Perhaps the book is substantially factual but, since it is also necessarily editorial, the absence of a creditable declaration of interest devalues this account of the author's years with the Senator. Kiss and tell is rarely pretty to behold."
3,interesting,"When this book was published it was hot stuff. A decade later it seems rather tame. Why did Burke write it? He seems to have no rancor against Kennedy and admits that everything Teddy did, he tried to outdo so the question is never really answered. The portraits of Joan Kennedy and Rose Kennedy are gentle, almost tender ones. The best part of the book is when Burke gets out of Kennedy's bedroom and starts talking about the political goings on behind the scenes. The chapters on the failed 1980 campaign and Kennedy's relations with the Carters are fascinating."
2,Very blurry at times,This dvd has very blurry pictures at times and it looks like it tiles at the beginning . kind of looks like a puzzle pieces. . Would be a lot interesting if picture was a lot clearer. Sorry .
4,Pretty Good,Pretty good book. It is for people with little or no java experience. Found several typos and code errors that I didn't find any documentation for!P.S. The source code IS available for download at http://support.apress.com/
3,It is a fast-paced thriller,"A friend of mine gave me this book and I picked it up since I needed a faster-paced read in the midst of moving. This book is definitely a fast-paced thriller ~~ you can't put it down.With events beginning with a bombing in a Georgetown restaurant, Kirk Macgrevor begins the hunt for the killers and finds a conspiracy between the Japanese and unidentified sources in the White House ~~ and with the countdown of a space ship in Japan looming, Macgrevor races against time to find the killers. He writes to keep you on your toes ~~ and I thoroughly enjoyed it even though the book has left me with more questions than answers ~~ as if the last few chapters were written in a haste and no answers to be found. That is why I rate this book a 3 star ~~ something was missing.Other than that, it is an enjoyable read. It's a great summer read ~~ it's a thriller unlike others.5-13-03"
3,Good - but a little slow through the middle,This is my first experience with David Hagberg. The book was good though I found it a little slow through the middle. The incident at the beginning was well written and had my hopes up for a continuing excitement level. This however tapered off somewhat through the middle of the book and then picked up with the last 1/3 when the story starts moving fairly fast.Overall good book - I'd recommend it to others and would read other Hagberg titles.Also: My copy (paperback) of the book fell apart. The cover came off and pages broke out of the binding.
2,Very Unrealistic,I have read all of Hagberg's books and unfortunately this one is not as good as the others. It goes into the realm of too unrealistic for a thriller. This story is definitely not on par with Ludlum and Cussler.
4,Human Insight,The Connemara Bus One of the few books I read cover to cover without taking two months or starting other books in between. It gives you a real feel for the Irish life.
1,Do Not Buy HP Printers unless....,"DO NOT BUY HP PRINTERS unless it is a New model.When it goes off warranty (like in 4-5 years) God help you.I had bought a OfficeJet d155xi All-In-One 4 years ago. The printer worked well for 4 years. Now it makes a lot of noise and neither prints nor faxes.I spent 8 hours with various HP tech Supports, and Registering my Info many times, ONLY to find that HP has Stopped supporting this model.The Rep said that the model is OBSOLETE. Ridiculous. I spent $700 and in 4 years this is Obsolete! Not Funny.THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH HP is that they put a Chip on their Inks which has a Clock. If you use the ink after 18-months from Manufacture, the Printer will STOP! So you CANNOT Stock up on Inks. HP forces you to pay full price for small quantities of Ink.I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HEWLETT PACKARD WOULD ENGAGE IN SUCH CONSUMER UNFRIENDLY PRACTICES.Buy HP only when on-sale, because in my eyes the HP Brand is Tarnished."
1,Ink Eater!,"Although this product is advertised as being a small office solution, anybody that has actually used it in an office environment will be aware that this thing eats ink! For small home use only. Office users beware!"
1,Horrible,"These tasted so bad I had to spit my bite into the garbage. It tastes like alcohol, wonder if my pack was just rancid?"
2,"Okay in a pinch, texture and flavor not that great","The chocolate in these bars is good. However, the chewy texture doesn't scream 'granola' to me. Also, there is a gross apple or fruity aftertaste."
3,Brushes underpowered,"I have to admit that maybe I was expecting too much from these brushes. I thought that with the power generated by the pressure washer the brushes would spin MUCH faster. But it appears that the nozzle controlling the water flow and the gearing is set to keep the spin rate down. This may be fine for use on something with a fine finish like a car, but I was hoping to use it to clean the patio furniture, siding, etc. and I think that it could benefit from higher RPM's for these tasks.Other than that, the brushes seem to be of good quality and the attachments all fit very well."
1,Another customer service failure,"While customer service from consumer electronics manufacturers is always seeking new lows, MPIO would be hard pressed to be worse. I was an early buyer of the FY200, and while mine was advertised and sold as being usable as a USB drive, a note in the box said that feature wouldn't work until updating the firmware. No functional firmware update tool or files are available at MPIO's web site."
2,Good but little storage,I got this as a gift and its easy to use - good sounds and lots of functions - however the storage is very small. Can only hold about 20 songs before you run out of memory. I would spend the extra money to get one with higher memory capacity.
2,Not in Excellent Condition,"This book was supposed to be in Very Good or Excellent condition and it was not. The book was taped together, writing on many pages, corners of pages folded down and the spine of book was broken with pages falling out."
2,Not up to the usual Pym standard,"A first novel--and it shows. Has all the charm of Barbara Pym's best work (Excellent Women, No Fond Return of Love) but is marred by narrative clumsiness and (frankly) lousy technique: characters appear out of nowhere, conversations start one place and end in another, etc. Skip this and focus on her later, great work."
4,Tragic Loss To Country Music,"Delp and Schuler's tribute to country star Mel Street is ""must reading"" for his legion of fans. Those unfamiliar with Streetfrom the late Sixties to late Seventies can still enjoy hisunique style in today's country music catalog, a manner of singing that ended too soon with his suicide, probably from multiple causes including alcohol. Street was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, having first performed in Bluefield, West Virginia prior to his rise to stardom and the Grand Ole Opry. From Street's early strugglefor perfection to his appearances with other big stars inCountry Music, Mel's story is lovingly told by the authors."
3,Not Enough Info,"Obviously these guys are fans, not writers. Book is in need of good editing. It's a little candy-coated, too. They left out some of the darker side of Mel's life like the pregnant girlfriend he left. Barely touched on his drinking and manic depression. Worth reading if you are a fan or knew him."
3,Decent for the price,"Great bed for the price. My beagles love their beds. My only disappointment was that the bottom of the bed underneath the pillow insert was not padded. It is just a thick layer of a nylon coated fabric. My dogs like to ""nest"" in their beds and very frequently will be under the pillow insert rather than on the pillow. This means that they are laying on hard floor since there isn't any cushioning under the pillow insert. Other than that - a good buy."
4,Live Forever,"Live Forever was a comedic take on the decade known as the 90s and the rise in British music scene at the time. The main bands interviewed were Blur and Oasis, but several other bands were mentioned, such as Nirvana. Several other things were adressed, such as the well-known feud between both Blur and Oasis. I will admit that Damon Albarn (lead singer and writer of Blur) came off as rude in this film. Also, my only real negative is that at times the accents were so thick I could not understand what people were saying, but that could have just been me."
4,wot brit pop/rock is all about,"it does capture the essence of the era...that being the 80s-90s of the brit pop/rock era. its a cliffnote version of the times with the well noted stars of the brit music business, noel and liam gallagher(luv ya blokes) as usual are dead on and funny as hell, damon of blur, the guy from pulp(too ugly to remember his name) and many more. i gave it 4 stars because it was an in depth look at the rise and fall of ""swinging london and reigning brit rock"" interesting, but i must say i took away that 5th star because they booed at all the american music...giving the impression that all of british rock was superior, when all of it is not...i've heard alot of brit music and i must admit alot of it is good and alot of it is rubbish as well. overall my 4 stars recommend this film to music lovers."
4,For what it's worth,"Nicely packaged documentary not only about Brit pop, but 90's Britian period. The main focus is on Oasis & Blur, with some Jarivs/Pulp (but not nearly enough). Live Forever runs a little over an hour and also touches on politics, fashion, and art of the time. I had nearly forgotten about that horribly cheesey Vanity Fair cover with Liam and Patsy, but there it was--along with a flood of memories of the time."
2,Go for the 25 Watt instead,"I purchased this for outdoor use in an open field. With volume turned down to half, the voice was maybe carried about 30 yards which basically means, I could have yelled over people to that distance. If turning up the volume over the half mark, we got serious feedback and distortion. The two sirens were not associated with the volume and were way too loud even for outdoors. Yes, it gets your attention but to the point of it being a noise nuisance. I do not recommend this megaphone and if I had another opportunity, I would have paid the little extra for the 25 watt.Pros: got the product on time and product was packaged very very well."
3,Same power supply issue...,"I bought this phone about a year and a half ago, and after about 8 months the base station stopped working. I called Vonage customer service and they were surprisingly helpful considering the horror stories that I have heard about them. They said the power supply was faulty, and it was a known issue, and they would ship us a new one ASAP. We received the new adapter within a few days, and we were back in business. Haven't had any problems since, but just recently the battery power has diminished significantly, but I assume they sell replacement batteries? We'll see..."
1,Stay away from this pice of junk,"Bought one had it for 9 months or so, unexpectedly it died, called customer service, awfull experience, almost a nightmare. They now the power adapter is faulty. Why are they still selling it? Anyway after a LOT of calls to customer service and 4 months later they shipped a power adapter replacement, back to normal again this time for only 4 months died again. Stay away from this."
1,Piece o' junk,"Had it for just over a year. We have had significant issues with it most of that time. Now, the battery life is about 5 minutes. That doesn't really matter though, as the microphone stopped working on it about a month ago so it's just a very expensive answering machine/caller ID now with no way to effectively take calls.Buy something else."
2,6 months life expectancy,"Purchased and installed about 6 months ago. Stationed overseas so Vonage keeps us sane. The service has been great but the phone died. After troubleshooting with Vonage over the landline phone, they determined the power supply was bad (the plug that goes into the wall). They said they would replace it. 1 month later, no plug. Called and they said they didn't show it was ever mailed. Said they would mail (again). After another month, no show. Took plug to electrician friend, said plug was fine. We took the box apart and the circuit cards were corroded with a white powder which he said was an indicator it got wet or was in a very humid environment for some time. Probably sat in warehouse months before shipping out to us. Ordered Linksys Phone Adapter which uses regular house phone and been gravy ever since. Should have known better, and linksys was cheaper."
1,"terrible phone, unreliable","Bought this phone when I signed up for Vonage less than a year ago. In 9 months, this phone has died twice unexpectedly. The first time it died, I could not receive calls or dial out. Trying to replace it through Vonage customer service was a joke. After at least 6 hours of hold times, and repeatedly explaining the problem they finally sent me a new one. I was without my phone for a whole month (completely unacceptable for running a business) and had to pay the shipping for the replacement phone. Thanks Vonage! Just four months later, the second phone has now completely died. Once again, Vonage customer service has proved to be no help. I took matters into my own hands and bought a Vonage/Linksys router with a regular phone. Everything works fine now so far. Fingers crossed."
5,I have had nothing but success since getting it working,"I have had it for almost two years now and love it. I know there are some really bad reviews here, but I must say I have not had their bad luck with this product."
1,Major issues with this phone,"I bought this phone originally through vonage and within 3 months it didn't work. No dial tone. Just got all static and quit working within a few day. After many hours on the phone with vonage troubleshooting (what a joke), they sent me a new one. Needless to say 4 months later i have the same exact problem, but this time it was a ""power addapter problem"". and this time it wouldn't light up. So once again tried vonages customer service.They are sending me a new one since it is still under warranty. But i just went ahead and ordered a whole new system from Staples and fingers crossed this works."
4,Did the trick...,"Vonage...How the mighty have fallen.Was a great product when it first came out. Saved us a fortune on international phone calls between India and the US. Eventually the phones just got overused, the batteries eventually died, and the base unit got fried.Technology developed and now we can call for free on iOS apps using Skype, Bobsled, or even Vonage's own app.These are a thing of the past but when they worked, they worked well."
3,Phone is good but charger is not.,I've had this phone for about 5 years. The phone is pretty good but the charger base is not a smart charger. It seems to overcharge the batteries and shortens the life of the batteries. Eventually the battery life is pretty short. I did like the phone enough to buy extra batteries for it at Batteries Plus. I'm sure they addressed the problem with the newer phones.
3,Charles Dickens,"This is an interesting primary source for anyone interested in the life ad work of Charles Dickens. No one doubts his achievements but unfortunately, he was a very nasty fellow and hurt more deserving scholars and writers. Their more scholarly work deserves greater recognition today."
4,Not a Dickens novel,"I had eagerly looked forward to reading this work. I had expected that Dickens would provide a rich Pickwick Papers-like cast of American characters. Instead Dickens writes of conditions, of scenery, of things but not really of people, not in the way anyway he writes about them in his novels. This made the book disappointing on the 'experiential level'.In terms of American vs.British conditions he does have interesting things to say. He strongly opposes Slavery and so will not travel to the slave - states. He notes a uniformity in American social opinion and condemns this, and a certain lack of manners. But he also see that in terms of democratic principles the United States is ahead of Britain.This is surprisingly a quite humorless work, again lacking one of Dickens defining virtues as a writer."
5,Lavishly illustrated guide to 1000 European species,"This guide is on a par with the older Roger Phillips ""Mushrooms"" and very similar in size and format. Unlike Phillips, all photographs have been shot in situ. With so few guides to fungi available, and each covering a particular selection, it's best to assemble a good library - and this should be one of the major works. Even though the focus is Europe, many of the fungi have much wider ranges and this book is invaluable in the Western Hemisphere too."
3,pretty good cut,hard to believe it's been a bit over a decade since this song&Her Debut album dropped.this cut works mainly because of Toni's range&the vibe she brought to it.a pretty good cut.
5,"The best 15 years ago, the best today","Exceptionally easy to use, well built and powerful. It provides a powerful and easy-to-use experience for all users aged 15 and over. I love it and use it still!"
1,product wasn't what was expected,The picture is of a new updated calculator. The one that was shipped to me was from 1994 and had a pixel out on the screen so you couldn't read the first line of data. Very disappointed.
1,"Don't even bother to ""save money"" from buying this.","I just got my item a while ago, i tried brand new batteries to make it work but it didn't. It doesn't operate at all."
3,"okay, but ti-82 more effecient","you really should get a ti-82 they are better and the graphing functions are easier to use i got one at a garage sale for 4.00 and i think that it was reasonable but not for the price that amazon chares, unreal"
1,The calculator did not work,"The calculator did not work when I got it even after putting new batteries in it so I contacted Mr. Carlson. He was so nice and got right back with me. He apoligized for it not working and said that he would return my money. And in a few short days, I got a check in the mail from him. I found him to be a very nice guy and very true to his word."
4,replaced my TI-30 Stat,I used a scientic calulator for years. I bought the TI-85 my Senior year of High School and even though I'm not yet in college (five years later) I'm still a nerd that likes to play on it. most of time I just use it for basic stuff I can still do with a new TI-30X I bought granted I can graph with it and I've been looking hard at TI-89 for no other reason than I can. (more than likely would be my next purchase if I did buy another one) the sad thing is resources for this calulator are limited seeing as it's been discontinued but you know it's still more powerful with it's computing power over my GF TI-83 plus. it just lacks the storage of memory.
1,That calculator is not the TI85 graphing calculator from Texas Instrument.,Don't get me wrong but that calculator shown in the picture is not the TI-85 graphing calculator from Texas Instrument. I have no idea what that thing shown in the picture is.
1,wrong model,"Unfortunately, when my son took it to school, he realized it wasn't the same calculator his teacher uses. All the buttons are in different places from the T83. I thought I was buying a newer model. So, for me it was a waste."
1,Not Satisfied!,"I purchased a TI-85 Calculator that said 'new'. However,when I recieved this item it had clearly been used it was scratched up cover and face and it had obviously been opened. Not only that but it was missing two of the batteries it had come with. I was very displeased if I would of wanted a used calculator I would'nt have paid $100.00 for it!"
5,"Nice, attractive and thick","These felt pads have many uses and are perfect. The picture is true to their appearance. I used them on all my kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room cabinets and drawers to prevent slamming of wood when the doors/drawers closed. They work GREAT for this purpose, and they are attractive too, blending in nicely with my cherry cabinetry, but I think they would look just fine on any wood tone. I also used them to put under lamps and heavy objects that are sitting on wood furniture, to prevent scratching. Finally, I used them to put on the bottom back portion of some picture frames hanging in my house, to prevent dinging the wall up. These are thicker than the ones I had used previously and definitely great quality and good adhesive, WITH the ability to remove, if needed. A great purchase."
5,The best,"The best brand for felt pads i've ever used for chairs and other furniture feet. I replace them every so often when the glue dries up or from wear-and-tear which is expected from chairs yu use daily. Make sure the floor is dry before moving chairs back so you don;t have moisture under the pad, especially if you have wood floors to avoid any potential mildew or mold. Excellent quality."
1,these pads fall off,"These pads looked good and were the right size for my chairs. But they did not adhere properly and kept sliding off, leaving gooey marks on the floor. I will try a different brand the next time."
1,Horrible!,These felt pads are supposed to keep your floors from looking scuffed up but all they do is leave glue on the floor and it ends up looking worse!
3,has a major errata problem on cover pattern,"I bought this book because I liked the garment on the cover, but the directions for making (crocheting) this garment are totally off-base. I tried for hours to make the stitch count increases match up with the directions given and it just didn't jive. If anyone else has tried to make this pattern and succeeded, I would greatly appreciate hearing how you did this. [...]"
3,Mostly Knitting,"If you are a crocheter you might be disappointed to see that most of the patterns are for knitting with crochet trimming. There are several crochet patterns but the scales tip more toward knitting. If I had been able to browse this book before buying I probably would not have purchased it. Luckily, at the time I made my purchase Lion Brand was selling it for 50% off so I'm not as disappointed as I would have been had I paid full price."
3,More Crocheted then Knit,"When I first picked up this book I wasn't paying much attention to the title and didn't even notice it had crochet patterns in it until I got it home. Flipping though the book at home I started to notice that all the patterns I wanted to try where crocheted, and when I looked through the rest of the book was split about 80/20, crochet/knit. That wouldn't be a big problem except that I have no idea how to crochet and being fairly new to knitting I don't want to pick up a new skill up just yet. My other big problem with the book is that the knitting patterns seem very bland and simple in comparison to the crochet ones and there was nothing in the book that made me want to go pick up a pair of needles and start knitting. Therefore, I would definitely recommend you page through this book at your local library if you are also a non-crocheter."
4,Vague instructions,"The book has beautiful and different patterns. I have only made one, the Alpine Toque. The photo of the hat was so beautiful, but while the instructions for the main body of the hat were fairly simple, the directions for the more unfamiliar parts were very vague. I had to ""wing it"" and finish it the best way I could. Even the woman on the helpline at Lion Brand didn't understand them."
2,Pretty ordinary stuff,"In the whole book there were only one or two items that attracted me. Most items are pretty ordinary; some are distinguished by frills or other design elements that I don't happen to like. Not a terrible book; and maybe in time I'll warm up to it. But if I'd seen it at a bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Great Introduction to using Vintage Patterns,"I barely had this book out of the box when I sat down and immediately made a project from the book. In one week's time, I've made another project. Directions are clear and easy to understand. Love comparing the pictures of the vintage piece and the same piece made up for today. Am very happy with the results of the two patterns I've done so far. Planning on doing two more. Wonderful book. Lion Brand does it again."
4,Fun ideas,This book surprised me. I was not expecting it to be all that useful. A young friend wanted me to make one of the patterns so I purchased it. Low-and-behold it's full of fun ideas. Being a pattern tweaker from way back I can see all kinds of possibilities. This book is worth shelf space.
3,Simple and Straight-Forward,"This dictionary is simple to understand and broadly categorized. If you are looking for an obscure term, such as in the occult, then this isn't the book to buy. Word Menu is still my first choice because it covers more topics in more detail. Descriptionary has one feature that I found attractive. At the back is a section, titled ""1,050 Words and Expressions You Should Know""."
3,Not for wider feet,"The elegant design will not accomodate wider feet.The external lateral cut will force the outside of the foot reverse over the sole, while the pinky toe will be squeezed and forced inwards, towards the other toes creating with time deformity and pain.The sole design is not following the natural foot position.On the foot, the upper sole looks stressed on the sides.However kudos to the Shoebuy company who has an excellent service."
5,Traditional Style Cuban Music,"For those fans of the uniquely pure style heard and danced to 65 years ago or last Saturday, this is it. At a minimum, tracks 1 and 2 will get you tapping on your knee."
5,A Nightmare trilogy,"I just ordered these books and must say if anyone is thinking about getting them...do so, not only will you get a good group of stories, but you cannot beat the price, three books in one ain't bad, I now have the whole series except for part 6 (which I will be ordering soon) if you're a fan of the films you should enjoy them in novel form as well.-J"
4,1 and 2 are great. Pity about 3,"The first three Nightmare on Elm Street films in book form. The first two are excellent and you really feel you know the characters whose backgrounds are explored nicely.But what happened to the novelising of Part 3? It starts off well but most of it bears no resemblance to the film at all and seems just an underdeveloped mish-mash. Very disappointing.The feeble novelising of Part 3 barely deserves one star, but the novels of the other two make this publication on not to miss. And there are some nice photos from the films."
4,Waylander's final adventure,"A brief summary of the plot is Waylander now called Gray Man must stop the demon world from being opened by an evil magic user. This book is good for people who like action a little more than plot because there are a few surprises but besides that its not really a mind blower. As for me I like the book because the action and charcter design keeped me reading it without getting bored. In my opinion it is one of David Gemmel's better one, but it is not the best book he has written. Over all I would suggest you read it if you crave action in books like me."
5,Almost Poetry,"Be prepared to experience the full spectrum of emotion. Goldsmith focuses on life before, not after, inevitable one-way deportation. The author presents the holocaust with fresh, more accessible, perspective. There's tragedy, to be sure, but also humor and beauty despite all. Inextinguishable Symphony, definitely not a story of numbing statistics."
5,A story of love and family,"This is a story of love, family and music told against the backdrop of the Nazi era. This is a moving story about the author's family and how they endured the hardships as Jews in Germany through their love of music.I have read many books on the holocaust and I find this book to be one of the most moving and touching. It's impossible to read this book without shedding a tear. It is a great story, and I truly recommend this book."
4,"A wonderful, if tragic story","I heard the author on NPR's ""Morning Edition"" and found his story incredibly captivating. I had to get a copy of his book, and I'm sure you'll agree that it's touching and lyrical."
2,Much addoo about nothing,"I cannot share the enthusiasm about this CD. Nobody will doubt James Carter's qualities as a saxophonist. However, this does not make this CD a satisfying musical experience. The artist merely uses the rather conventional blues-background to show off. This seems rather puerile. The blues has to be re-invented and not simply repeated in order to remain alive. Muscially this CD is dead stuff."
3,Buyer Beware,"I bought this ring to use as a junker substitute wedding band when out in the woods/backpacking/etc. To be quite honest, the price is right here for a nearly disposable ring. It really is dirt cheap. But, you get what you pay for. As I wore the ring today to get a feel for it, I noticed the seam where it was sized as the solder showed up as a distinct dark strip with a large pool at one end of the seam. It is insignificant due the role this ring plays for me, but you should be forewarned that the quality, at least in my case, is directly proportional to the price. If you're looking for something nice that you will wear on a regular basis, you may want to spend a little more money, but if you want a beater to take damage you would rather not inflict on the wedding band you invested in, this is perfect.<edit> Well, to seal the deal, it turned my finger blue over night due to the sloppy solder job."
1,Beauty in Scenery and Human Emotion,"This is a beautiful story, beautifully told and directed.But why, oh why, do only people from outside the US get to see it in the 2.35:1 widescreen version that really makes the film as beautiful to look at as to hear?For shame, studio, for shame!Film: 5 starsThis DVD version: 1 star"
5,Excellent insight,"After traveling in China for 5 weeks and then reading this excellent book, I really could relate to it. Especially after talking to people in China about the effects of the ""Cultural Revolution"" this book had an excellent inside.I also recommend the Movie on DVD.J. Hesse"
3,Not the same as the book,"It was a beautiful movie, but after having read the book, I expected something else. Certain elements seemed rushed compared to the book, and some things just seemed to have been changed for no reason."
1,A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,"Follow the advice in this book and you will get much much sicker. Poor chelation redistributes mercury in the body and makes you ill. Not understanding that chlorella is NOT a chelator and that you HAVE to chelate with ALA on a very precise, rigorously dosed schedule is a recipe for pain, illness, and ultimately, death.Instead, try Amalgam Illness, by Andrew Cutler."
2,Expensive mail,"The 'book' was more like a pamphlet that could have been sent as a letter. It was sent in a large box with lots of empty space, and the mailing cost me more than the booklet itself. Sending it as a letter would have meant money saved."
4,Nice book on African American History,Great read on Significant African American Women in History. A much needed book on a little written about portion of American history
2,Caution: Bulky !,Please check the size of the mouse before buying this. It's height is half the width of my laptop. I thougth it would go into my palm by seeing the picture. But finally returned the product due to the unexpected bulky appearance. But it have a very nice modern look !!!
3,"One works, One doesn't","I have two of these, one at home, one at work. I always like to use the same mouse in both places for convenience. I've had them both about a year. The one at home works just fine, surrounded by my wireless lan, wireless phones, etc.However, the one at work is a pain in the rear. Double clicks when I only single click, very erratic movement, sleeps when I'm awake, jumps around when I least expect it. I had to pull out my wired Microsoft Intellimouse 3.0 which works better, albeit without the side to side scrolling which I need for spreadsheets. I've tried moving the receiver to different slots, removed bluetooth keyboard and went back to wired keyboard, all to no avail. The thing just has a mind of it's own!"
4,Very good product,"I use every feature of this product and would change very little.It fits my hand, the buttons are well positioned, the email and chat indicators are great, the curve fits nicely.I would like a more ergonomic shape, with recessed finger slots, more hand lean and possibly a tacky surface. Kind of like Microsoft mice. But with this mouse's functionality, it's the best current option."
2,Pointer finger hurts,"Am I the only one with this problem? I've tried different ways of holding the thing, but either way the clicking is too firm and the finger hurts. I can't use this."
1,Almost Perfect,"I bought this mouse for work a little less than a year ago, and it has been outstanding. Great fit for the hand, nice additional buttons - the volume control is handy, and I love a mouse wheel that doesn't rotate freely.However, it now appears to randomly double-click when i simply left click one time. At first it wasn't happening too often but after a few weeks, it happens about 80% of the time. Nothing feels physically wrong with the mouse, but it just decides to double-click instead. It shouldn't be hard to imagine just how completely mind numbing this can turn out to be when trying to navigate a computer. I disabled all Logitech software and it still happens, so it seems likely the hardware has worn out somewhere. If it had lasted a couple years at least, I'd consider it again, but definitely not until they can take care of this issue."
3,"Nice mouse, but not for wireless laptops","The mouse has great ergonomics, and customizations are top-notch. I bought it to use with my Dell XPS M1710 laptop computer. I was hoping to use it for gaming. My experience is that the movement is VERY choppy, esp when there is a lot of network traffic going on. I suspect that the 2.4Ghz transceiver is interfering with the wifi, causing the herky-jerky action. For now, I'm back to a corded mouse, while I look for a better wireless model."
5,Excellent. It is truly cordless - no cords !,I am a mouse freak - have a job that requires me to be on my computer all day long. Just got this mouse a couple of days ago. Have been able to get the Email and the IM buttons working. The email button only work with Outlook and Outlook express. The best part of this mouse is the comfortable shape. It is also truly cordless. Most cordless products come with a receiver that has a long cord. The 610 just has a very small receiver.
3,Software issue,"The mouse is great. Feels great. However, the software won't work if you use a KVM switch. After you switch to another computer then return to the other one, the software ""SetPoint"" fails to response to any special assigned commands, such as scroll, adjust the volume, mute, etc. Unless you reboot the machine.Logitech's website recommends that you directly plug the USB recevier to the PC not through a KMV switch."
4,Does it's job well,I like this product very much. Now I can't work without using this mouse. It works atleast upto 15Ft. I connect my laptop sometimes to TV and use this mouse as kind of remote for watching videos from laptop.I think this is a bit expensive that's why I didn't give 5 stars.
2,Worked great for 6 months,"For the first 6 months, this mouse worked great. It eats batteries though. In the beginning, the batteries lasted just over 2 months. Now they only last about a month.For the first 6 months, I could use on any surface without any problems. Over time, the mouse movement started to get jerkey. After about 6 months, the jerkiness renders the mouse pretty much useless.If you like to swap batteries and only keep mice around for about 5 months, then this is the mouse for you."
3,ok...just ok,"Overall is ok. ""ok"" means is not bad at doing routine jobs. NO GOOD at gaming, it's just way too heavy...plus, batteries run out fast..."
4,the mice itself feels good but the program is not that good,"I am having problem with my IM notifications light. I alread enable it, but whenever I received a new message the IM light never lights it up. Any one having the sme problem. Or anyone know how to fit this problem."
3,only so-so on OS X,"As reported by others, this mouse is very comfortable. The many extra buttons are nice, well placed, and not overly flashy or interuptive. I'd have given it 5 stars, except that it doesn't come with software for running in OS X, nor is any available. On OS X, the buttons that work are the three volume buttons, verticle and horizontal scrolling, and both primary buttons. The email, IM, forward, and back buttons do nothing. That's a real bummer, as I'd hoped to use them. Equally sad is that I can't customize the other buttons. Why is there no OS X software for such a nice product from such a big company? I'm surprised, given that other logitech mice do have OS X drivers, and given that OS X has been superior to microsoft's operating systems for quite some time now (IMHO). I guess I'll have to wait for some third party driver to pop up."
3,"Good mouse, but beware of interference problems","I have had this mouse for over a year now. I think it is a good mouse - it is comfortable and precise, and I like being able to control the sound level when I am watching a movie on the computer from across the room.My problem with it is that because it is cordless, it stops working when there is interference. Unfortunately, I have it next to my wireless router, so every time someone accesses the internet over the network, my mouse stops working. Anyone with the potential for wireless interference at 2.4 GHz should consider another mouse. Perhaps other cordless mice deal with the problem better."
2,"Erratic mouse movement, bad software and...","... very bad battery life. I just own this mouse for a month and I have just thrown it into my drawer for its life. Logitech software often crash my computer no matter how many times I have reinstalled and clean my registry. The mouse movement is not smooth and this happen quite often. I need to unplug the IR USB and re-plug into another USB port of my computer. Then it will start working fine. It just wasting my time and annoying. It also have so many useless buttons when you can't get logitech software to work on your computer.Another weakness is the battery life which only last about a month with a brand new Duracell. Unless you have rechargeable batteries lying around your house, if not, I suggest to get a charger and a set of batt. Good Luck."
3,Not as good as expected,"I have been using this mouse for a few months. Frankly I am a little disappointed at it.Pros: good-looking, comfortable, many handy functions, very small receiver, which is good because it doesn't take my desk spaceCons: movement is not smooth!!!! sometimes there is a little delay. But the worst thing is that the mouse icon just blinks from place to place while moving. And the movement destination is always a little different from my expectation, which make my hand very tense after using it for a while.This is my first wireless mouse, so maybe these problems are common to all wireless mouses. But I don't really recommand this one. It is a comfortable mouse, its shape fits human hands very well. But if you use computer a lot, probabaly a wired mouse is more accurate."
2,Just plain bad!,"This is about my SIXTH Logitech mouse now over these many years. I even had this same model a few months ago, but I let my kid talk me out of it.Silly me. THAT one was a DREAM compared to this piece of junk.I have had this since, oh, maybe April, & the problems are just getting worse every day.This mouse skips all over the page, constantly makes me wait to use the cursor again, plus it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow.FRUSTRATING describes this mouse to a tee!I cannot believe how horrible this mouse is! I'd like to throw it out of the window, but that would be adding insult to injury.I'm going to the Logitech pages next, but I'm not hopeful. Then I'll look on the blogs.I hope to find a solution....Probably won't.I did my research before I bought this, but the previous one worked so well, I never thought I'd have any problems with this one. HAH!!No more Logitech mice here."
2,Erratic,"Bought a cordless notebook laser mouse by another manufacturer which worked thought a regular size cordless laser mouse would be even better. Wrong, like the other Logitech cordless mice I have had it tracks erratically, and can not be used near other cordless products. Do not plug receiving unit in the back of a PC because it will not track at all (only a maximum of three feet.) Do not waste your money on a cordless mouse from Logitech especially if used for games."
3,Good Laser Mouse,This is a pretty decent mouse. Battery life is excellent and the accuracy is good. Only setbacks are the SetPoint software overrides windows commands for some programs so I can used the lights at all time when I want to...and I cant believe that there isnt a patch for the use of AIM as an IM client. Noone used windows live much...at least I dont.Thanks why I gave it 3 stars....a good mouse but not so useful for multitasking.
3,Gets interference from wi-fi and drains batteries,"I have used this mouse for just under two years now. It is good ergonomically and has a good selection of buttons. But, if I were to get a chance to change what I had bought, I would. Reasons why? Poor battery life. I usually change batteries a minimum of once a month. Also, occasionally gets interference from my wi-fi network which makes the mouse almost impossible to use. Also, the mouse lags somewhat too. A bit heavy for gaming as well and the annoying blinking red battery light is too much as well."
2,Nice Mouse but Email/IM Buttons Do NOT Work,"It is a nice mouse all around. But the core feature it advertises does NOT work. I use outlook 2003, the button actually flashs when outlook finishes send/receive, however, it flashs even I have no new email. For the IM, I tried MSN 7.5 and Windows Messenger, none of them ever work.No support / help show you how to configure it. Seems no one make IM work in the Logitech web forum. My 2 stars rating might be a bit low because it is a nice laser cordless mouse. However, it cannot deliver what it promised."
2,Looking for a better wireless mouse,I got this mouse as a gift about 4 months ago; I find it to be very uncomfortable because I'm left handed and I have small hands.I've developed carpal tunnel syndrome my left hand because of it. It doesn't matter that you can reverse the buttons..the shape doesn't fit the left hand at all. I'm going to give it to my right handed son and find another mouse that will be comfortable for my hand.
3,The Logitech MX 610 Cordless Laser Mouse,"I find that the cordless laser mouse functions well when only the pointer is used. The other functions are a miss,hit performance."
2,OK mouse--cheap company,"I hate to complain, but Logitech welched on their rebate offer. Amazon offered a limited time mail-in rebate on Logitech and I did it all right--no rebate. I emailed Logitech to ask why and they did not respond. I like the mouse--nothing special--nice to be cordless."
4,MX 610 works well,The logitech MX 610 works well with no impact on the notebook's battery life and excellent battery life on the mouse. Mouse is very comfortable to use and tracks smoothly and accurately. Only disappointment is that the mouse does not work with AOL Instant Messanger to light the mouse when new messages are received.
4,"This book is excellent, but not for the average romance reader",This book has substance is not the story of a stupid heroine that cannot believe the heroe is in love with her. The characters are believable and the plot is intelligent. Not disappointing at all.
1,sad ravings by an exhibitionistic media freak,"If this is the state of current conservative discourse, it only shows how low these people have sunk. Of course, this whole stunt is probably just a stunt from someone who craves negative attention, knowing that is the best she can ever hope to attain. Without Fox Zoo News, where would she and her ilk be?"
1,Are there actually still people reading this tripe?,"Zero stars.Are there still people who believe that this is the America which Washington, Jefferson, Adams Sr. & Jr., and especially Lincoln gave their all to protect and defend?Don't people who think they are ""on the right side"" realize that President Clinton was ready to go after Osama Bin Laden well before 9/11 but didn't because of the incessant attacks and negative press generated by this pseudo-writer and her illiterate ilk?Why is anybody buying a hate-mongering piece of doggerel like this and thinking that they are doing something good?Doesn't anybody see that the fit is going to hit the shan very soon and we'll all have Watergate all over again?Please wake up America, before we're all through..."
1,Anyone can write a book these days...,"It doesn't matter if you ignore the facts and instead just rant and rave. Hey, if you please the right people you're going to make lots of money! I think I'm going to write my own book called, ""How to talk to dumb blonds, if you must."""
5,Great Book!,As usual Ann Coulter is exactly right. This book exposes the America hating liberals for what they are. I recommend this book to all conservatives and to liberals that want to come over to the RIGHT side of politics.
5,The left reviews speak for themselves,"Just look at Brian Deuel's 'review' of this book, (as if he actually read it.) Mr Deuel, not actually pinpointing anything wrong with the book simply calls the author a 'wacko' and 'extremist' and is reduced to braindead name-calling ""shove her opinions disguised as fact up her rear is more fitting, I would think"" to quote.Coulter systematically adresses exactly why liberals have no backbone behind their ideas and therefore why they hate it when they are questioned. Most of the liberal biased reviews on this are nothing but whiny paragraphs on why they hate the author and the right, not a balanced account of the book itself.It's title is indeed patronizing towards the left, but the substance this book holds easily re-inforces its credibility so make no mistake, this is extremely well-written text and entertaining at the same time."
1,Deport this Fascist now!,"Laden with horrifically warped perceptions of the modern American politic, its a damn shame that any part of a living tree had to die so that this piece of rubbish could be printed. Beyond a nice set of legs, the author is lacking of any redeaming qualities so she must resort to shock statements which actually lack in shock because her political commentary and jabs at liberals are little more than recycled jokes and predictable cheap shots. Im convinced that if Ms Coulter had an original idea, it would die of lonliness. This was really a very lame read."
1,Going Soft,"Ann Coulter is going soft. In this book she pulls some of her punches. I wish she would go at it a little harder like she did in Treason. That was a wild book. This book is a big let down after reading that one. If you didn't read any other books by Ann yet, go for Treason first. This one is at the bottom of the list."
1,Even more rediculous right wing propaganda.......,"I like to consider myself a left-leaning centrist and read this book only because of the enormous amount of press Ann Coulter has received over these last few years. Her views of the world are too simplistic and never really makes a valid argument while making herself look like a raving lunatic. She is an embarrassment not only to the political right (of which I am admittedly not a member of), but truly a disgrace to American values and liberals everywhere alike. If you like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Hannity and Colmes you will certainly will like this fear-inducing, hate-spewing work of trash. Sorry Ms. Coulter, but this is awful."
5,Mean Spirited and Vicious,"This is the third book by Ms. Coulter that I have read. I found it to be a vicious and mean spirited attack on those she disagrees with, and I absolutely loved it!! She says the things the rest of us are too nice to say. I say the heck with Bush and Kerry I want Ann Coulter in the White House."
2,I love her style,But this book was just continous rambling. I did not like the whole idea of reading old articles.
1,One star is infinitely too many,"One of the titles in Ann's ""book"" is WHO WOULD JESUS KILL?Poor, overconfident, under-imformed Ann must be totally unaware that Jesus would never kill anyone.But then, who would expect that Ann actually knows anything about Jesus or any other topic that she ""writes"" about? She has even less regard for facts than she does for people with liberal thinking.By the way, Jesus was a liberal."
1,Deliver US From Coulter & Her Cronies!,"To bad there is not a -5 star!As Close Minded AS you can get. A Real Simpleton!This is what happens when a proper education is not instilled in one at an early age in life. It is people like her that make me embarassed to answer, when I am asked my nationality in a foreign land!Hopefully she is not far from burning out, and FADING AWAY!Based on her books, and how they all talk the same talk, same old, same old rhetoric, her fading away should not be far off!A hate monger only has followers for so long, before they (the followers) wake up and smell the coffee!Much better books to spend your time on. However, if your only motive is just to see what some of the folks are being hypnotized into, then it could be entertaining. I suggest using this rag as kindling in the fireplace for the chestnuts as soon as you are done!"
1,"Embarrassing Attempt, Ann","Yeah... Ms.Coulter aimed for witty, and she fell short at obnoxious. This book is pointless, and I was disappointed."
1,disappointing,"I love how some people think it is as simple as black and white. Sure everything can easily be clumped into the two catagories of libral and conservative, democratic or republican. It seems to be a little immature to judge this entire group anyway. Stereotypes make a great foundation for a book."
2,A women of many tactics,"Sometimes she raves and sometimes she rants, the really interesting parts are when she tries to do both at the same time.This book is better then ""Treason"" because it stays away from a topic that Ann knows nothing about (the history of the Cold War) and stays more towards current events.And that's fine everyone is entitled to an a point of view the problem with Ann's arguments in all of her books are threefold1. I'm right and you're wrong2. I don't have to listen to you3. I don't even have to acknowledge that you exist (look at the title)So what it all boils down to are examples that are as idiotic as the premise. Maybe in Ann's world of rich people we can all ignore each other if we have differing political views but in the real world where we have to work for a living it isn't like that.Overall-Don't waste the energy or the time."
1,"Oh, Please",Ann again claims compassionate conservatism while she spews her hate for everyone that isn't white and American. I honestly wonder how she can sleep at night.
5,Fantastic,"Ann Coulter is as smart as she is funny! If only all media types were as informed as she! Also, prepare to snort-laugh many a time."
3,Love it or Loath it,"While I agree with a lot of her viewpoints, the fact is Ann Coulter is one of those characters you either love or loath. While a lot of her ideas are good, she's not going to convince anybody (especially liberals) because her writing style only allows her to preach to the choir.Certainly if any conservative is interested in mutual understanding with the opposing side the Ann Coulter approach might not be the best one for you. However, if you want to know you're right, how you're right, just how much everyone else is wrong and how to relay that information and wrap it up in little strips of sarcasm then look no further!While it can be funny and interesting there are essays that are rather dated and won't hold much relevance. It's good for a laugh and for the conservative there's a lot to agree with, but this is certainly no way to talk to a liberal."
1,Anyone ever considered that Ann's not for real?,"I mean, seriously: She basically is a caricature. Her looks, her books (short, repetitive, not really, ahm, researched), her life (she's living in Manhattan, for heaven's sake! why not in San Fran?!). Maybe it's all just satire. What if she writes a book in a few years: ""My Life as a Conservative Barbie Doll""...?Come on, you can't say you haven't thought about that, can you?"
3,Interesting...,"I recently finished Ann Coulter's latest book. It did raise some interesting points, although some are exaggerated or given slanted coverage in the book.What interests me, looking through the reviews, is that nerly everyone has given the book either ""5 stars"" or ""1 star"" reviews. Many people who read these books do so with their minds already made up from the start.... if they read them at all. I would bet that a quarter of these reviews are written by political ""zealots"" who have never actually read the book.Think about it."
3,Did not live up to the title,"As much as I like Ms. Coulter and her humor, and I loved 'Demonic'. I learned a great deal that I did not already know from 'Demonic'. I was disappointed by the content of 'How to talk to a liberal'. It was not what I expected. I really wanted to learn how to talk to and present arguements to a liberal. Instead the book was mainly old op-eds that Ms. Coulter wrote. They are good and they are valid, but just not what I expected based on the title."
3,Haven't read it yet...but I admit it!,"I thought this was a place for people to review the book, NOT Ms. Coulter. It is not possible that any of you have read this book and can comment on it...it just came out today! Once you do read it, stop proving her points and actually counter something she says, don't just attack her...you're making her arguments for her just by opening your mouth!"
5,Liberals.....end to America as we know it !!!!,How would we be able to talk with a Liberal if Ann did not coach us ?Excellent insight and recommended reading for everyone to be able to respond to any stupid Liberal arguments about anything important.....Read it and then talk with a liberal....
1,Just couldn't stomach it,"The difference between Ann Coulter and her opponents on the left (Al Franken, Molly Ivins, Jim Hightower) is that they make it clear where the line is between fact and satire. Coulter makes no such distinction.In short, I just don't trust her."
1,Pure nonsense.,Not once did Ann Coulter even come close to a linear rational thought at any point in this book. It's simply hate-slogans for the uninformed.
1,A-Bomb or Convert! How to put on a Spanish Inquisition,"This text is but a few of her past rants compiled under a new title and hardly worth bothering with. When interviewed on Fox, she said that the US should go into Muslim countries and CONVERT them to Christianity and KILL all those who won't convert! The fact that people STILL have her on talk shows is a sad reflection on our society."
1,The World According to Ann Coulter,"God Ann, I thought you were sexy until you opened you're mouth. I gathered from you're book you define liberal as one who doesn't support interests of corporate america.If you're not wealthy you should sacrifice your own interests so the rich can be richer. It's better to die because you can't afford you're prescriptions than be defined as a liberal. It's better to support companies like Georgia Pacific that plans on dumping 160 million gallons of toxic waste a day into the St, Johns river than have the scorn of a hot blond like you (NOT). I guess it's OK because you're interests are Jesus's interests like supporting our imperialist nation that occupies other nations to exploit their resources. I'm sure Jesus would suppport that because we all know he only allows the ultra richwho exploit the rest of us into heaven."
1,ummmm,Does this women have any friends???? I think that it's sad how she's puts herself in the position of angry attack dog for the crazy people who live on the outskirts of reality.
1,Unfounded Vitrol and Venom,"Ann Coulter has never been known for letting facts get in the way of her polemics, and she proves it again with this, her latest racist, sexist, hate-filled tome that lets her jagged and angry rhetoric loose with no regard for sensitivity, context, or fact.Just another tome-like epistle filled to the brim with vicious lies."
1,The Howard Stern of politics,"Ann Coulter reminds me of Howard Stern- she spews out random things that make no sense just for the shock value. I have to admit, I love political humor. But this book was completely worthless dreck. All of the assertions and arguements she makes lose both their credibility and their humor since it is clear she has done absolutely not an ounce of research for this book. She makes radical claims about everyone from Bill Clinton to Al Franken that aren't supported by a shred of evidence. At least Al Franken's books are impeccably researched. She wrote this book just to be inflammatory. I think this country has enough division right now without people like Ann Coulter trying to make things worse for the sole purpose of pulling people further apart. Her hate mongering is really kind of frightening."
3,play balls!,"I knew Ann back when she called herself Tex Watson -- and it is truly thrilling to see how well she has done.She's been keeping her Adam's Apple mighty busy attacking liberals -- and she has a point. My only difficulty with Ann's material is when she delves into the politics of transgenderism. Christine Jorgensen still seems more intelligent, more cultured than Ann. But let's give the estrogen some time -- and greet Ann's book with the same generosity of spirit she has given to so many."
1,One Thing at least,"The only thing at all interesting about this book is the concept ""liberal"", as ""understood"" by the unfortunate Ms Coulter. She has a remarkable concept. This ""liberal"" is realy , as we said in college,a ""hurtin' dude."" He is actually dimmer than Ms. Coulter, not an easy thing. Looking up Ms.Coulter's ""footnotes"" is a remarkable experience. But there is, in America, a huge audience for this. Hey, Phil Collins and Kenny Rodgers did okay also. God bless America. A lot of people like hearing someone say that it is GOOD to be an idiot. It's comforting I guess. If you have a morally bankrupt life, and your values are lawns and SUV's, this is your book."
2,Just another poser !!!!,"Only the politically naive, bible worshipping, narrow mimded southern protestant can appericate her dim witted political ramblings. some conservaties contends she's the chomsky of the right...give me a break she hasn't produced a single work that deserves any scholarly recoginition unlike chomskys. well she would be happy if her IQ ranks even quarter that of chomsky's.It's high time the american right come up with someone better who can engage in meaningfull way."
1,The Title Says It All.,"If your partisan, closed minded, easily taken in, erratically violent, ill informed, interbred with a room temerature IQ and a prediliction for dyed blonde bimbos preteding to have intellectual asperations then this is the book for you! Yes you must talk to liberals, you must talk to your fellow man it is the way we learn and progress. But of course you won't learn that here."
1,This actually sells???,"Ann Coulter thinks she is far more clever than reality shows. The truth is that every single country has their quacks and loonies, yet only in America are these people actually taken seriously. She spews forth garbage like this and poor saps buy it and make her a fortune. I honestly can't believe how many suckers there are in the world, but I guess I learn something new every day.This book is only funny in a sad sense. Ann Coulter represents the worst that humanity has to offer all rolled into one neat package! Maybe instead of buying this book you people could have an outburst of intellectual curiosity and buy something classic; maybe a Hemingway, Faulkner, Melville or Dickens novel. But hey, who am I kidding right?I leave you with a quote by Wilhelm von Leeb, a German general: ""A businessman whose wares are good does not need to boost them in the loudest tones of a market crier.""Try to figure out how it applies to Ann Coulter."
5,Sounds like moron to me,"I love it when people who don't even read the book comment on it. Ok, libster, you want the nation to come together and focus on America but then ask to combat WORLD hunger? Smooth."
1,poor at best,Tired rehash of Rush Limnaugh radio bits from the early 1990's. Ann is to writing as Britney is to music.
5,"loved, loved, loved it.",I got the CD because I drive a long commute to work. I loved it. Ann is so smart and sassy. Liberals can not handle the truth. They hate religion other than islam (can't offend the muslims) It is about time someone wrote a book on how so many True Americans feel. Read this book or listen to it and it will enrich your life.
1,The nutcase is at it again,"More ignorant ravings from the conservative whacko that tried to defend McCarthy's witch-hunt, said that we needed to kill the leaders of non-Christian faiths and force them to convert to Christianity, and said her only regret about Tim McVeigh was that he didn't assassinate the people at the New York Times. Coulter has been proven time and time again to be a liar on par with Rush Limbaugh. Her ""books"" are always rife with lies and ad-hominem attacks, all the while complaining that those evil liberals do it. It frightens me that the people that think she's saying anything politically relevant are allowed to vote. Try taking your blinders off and watch Coulter when someone with facts confronts her. She falls to pieces and is unable to factually defend her ignorant statements, and instead resorts to attacking the person that dared question her - which is the typical Republican reaction."
1,How to Talk to a Liberal...,"Talking to a liberal can be entertaining and fun! Just follow these three simple steps and you'll do just fine:1. Use logic and verifiable facts.2. Refrain from invoking The Bible as the final authority on reality.3. Share *your own* political conclusions, not those of AM radio talking heads. (Please note: If you do not have your own political opinions, perhaps it really is best not to speak to a liberal. 'Ditto-heads,' marked by their lack of independent thinking, are easily recognized, and no liberal wants to hear the rants of a political parrot.)"
1,rants from a mad woman.. she needs a true man,I honestly don't believe that a rational human being can believe a fraction of the madness she espouses. She seems to have chronic/daily PMS. Enough. I can't say more because it doesn't deserve to be acknowledge any further.BTW why would anyone wants to talk to you?
1,"Pure Schlock, she's laughing at you all the way to the bank...",I found my in a thrift shop for a buck and had to see what all the fuss is about. She is pure sensationalist garbage. She is trying to be some kind of clown or comedian. What a crock. I wouldn't wipe my ass with her.
2,It is about time we talked...,"I think that the most important thing in these times of change and uncertainty is that we Americans talk. We need to take off our filters for a moment and walk in someone else's shoes. We keep going into the conversation taking the most extreme position knowing we will lose some ground, but if we talked about what we really cared about and what was really important then we would find that we have more in common than not. At that point it would make the decision process a lot easier. I think that it is about time that we as a country grow up and stop with the name calling. I give Ann's book 2 stars because of the title revolving around discussion and because she then uses it as a vehicle to drive a stake between us. I believe that her real goal is a dividing the enemy to make manipulation easier."
2,"I am absolutely baffled by you all,","Like a few others, I'm commenting on your comments. WHY does ANN COULTER produce a LUKEWARM response by you all? Many reviews are approved )or disapproved) by a slim margin -- one third to one half. Hardly ANY reviews of her books (i've looked at others)are either universally liked or disliked. What gives?NOTE i've skimmed two of her books, because I'm so soft headed that I actually think I can learn from my opponents. I give her two stars for chutzpah. (Somebody explain to her what chutzpah is.)In constrast, read the amazon.com reviews of Frank Rich's ""The Greatest Story ever Sold,"" which seems to make the usual liberal attempt to be fair and somewhat respectful of his opponents. Most of the reviews of his book are overwhelmingly approved or disapproved by 5 to 1 or 10 to 1.Ann Coulter produces lukewarm responses. Frank Rich provokes fervid love or hate. Can somebody explain this for me???????"
1,Ann Coulter is a screeching idiot,"Don't waste your time...I thought she might have something to say as the ""darling of the right."" She doesn't."
2,this was a gift,I got this for a gift and they read for enjoyment. They did not read this. It was to strong.
1,Hardly what is expected of a smart writer,"A true dissapointment that this book is only a rehash of every attack on liberal dogma ever said; it brings nothing new to the table and is not really an informative book, but only Ann Coulter's way of taking advantage of the country's political climate. She hardly instructs how to debate isues with liberals instead just goes on a rampage that is sure to widen the breach between americans in a time where we should all stand together. Her book will sell because it is incendiary and adequate for its intent (make fast money before the election and it's hype are over), however it is a kind of propaganda literature that strives to divide not reconcile. In summary, it actually says nothing about how to rationally discuss ideas with other people (in this case liberals) it only seems to attack people for their views. Makes me wonder what has become of true and great american literature...."
1,Ironic,"Coulter seems to think it's impossible to speak to liberals, when it's equally as hard to talk to onservatives. Unless you have some lingering hatred for liberals, or have not been able to express yourself to them, this book is for you."
4,"Entertaining, informative read","(...)I think Ann's strength is her columns, they are more lighthearted and entertaining than her other books which are well-reasoned but more serious in tone. She is the Mike Tyson of conservative commentators (without the ear-biting) and lands blows on leftists like no other. More!"
1,It Needs Zero Stars,"Love to hate her. She would be funnier if she weren't so desperate. Have you noticed how most conservative talkies tend to freak-out when they get into a hot debate about reality? I guess it really frustrates Ann that people insist on believing what they see instead of what they are told they see. Isn't it just like a conservative, narrow-minded, control freak, to instruct you on how to talk to ordinary people? Maybe I'll feel more like laughing after Nov 2nd."
1,What?,"I am absolutely floored by this book- and I did read it from cover to cover- only to be overwhelmed with the hatred and insanity spewing from page, after page, after page. I don't know what is going on with this country anymore. This woman is a sociopath- probably over due for some anger managerment following her stay in a padded cell."
1,Pure Disgust,Ann Coulter is the Devil incarnate!!! God help us and all those who feast on her backward thinking.
1,More to be pitied,"This ""book"" reads like the rantings of a crazy woman. It's really some weird, wild, out-there stuff, man. I've heard she actually turns in the rough drafts of her work in crayon. To be ""fair and balanced"" though, I will allow as how she's easy on the eyes...in fact, that's, I'm sure, the only reason she's gained any notoriety at all. Otherwise, she'd have been consigned to the dung heap of the squalid and witless long ago..."
2,People actually pay money for her books?,"Coulter states that the way to make a liberal happy is to attack the United States. Again, Ms. Coulter fails to see the distinction between the government and the United States. But, like many on the far, far, far, far right she has no trouble whatsoever with that concept whenever a Democrat occupies the White House. Only when a Republican does. How she and other on the far, far, far, far right can do this I have no idea. I myself would be self aware of that level of hypocrisy. The United States is great by people who have made it better, not by people who have loved the status quo. People like MLKjr, Cady Stanton and of the founders Paine and Madison. Indeed if Ms. Coulter was a just older I am sure she would have been one on the far, far,far right who called King unamerican and a traitor. Strange how people that the far right once hated they now call their own. Maybe one day the far right will embrace Michael Moore. Who knows."
3,"So, ""factual"" that it tends to make me put the book down!..","Look!.....I love Ann Coulters's politics!... I""m a devout Conservative and know that ""Capitalism"" is the only wayfor America!...so, I thought that her book would be a joy to read, but I was mistaken. Now, its probably ME,who just simply does not want ""fact after fact"" on almost every page. Yes, I told you it was probably me!.I mean if Coulter were running for President, I'd surely vote for her!..She's exactly what America needs, nowmore than ever!..I suspect that if her book would have been edited by any expert editor, that I would have then foundit easier to read. I guess, that doesn't say much for my intellect, but there you have it!..God Bless Ann Coulter (without the e on Ann)....."
3,Not my favorite Ann Coulter,"For the reasons listed by another reviewer (who only gave it 1 star), this was my least favorite Ann Coulter book. It was particularly mean-spirited to the point where I was distrcted from the original point Ms. Coulter was trying to make. As always, I appreciate that her research is second to none. It is what it is! Anyone who bashes this book for being ""conservative"" is just silly. She brings out some interesting information which much of the media has downplayed, put a spin on, or flat out ignored. Personally, I would be much more impressed if she could do it without insulting on levels that have nothing to do with politics. Know what you're getting in to and enjoy!"
1,How to Talk to a Labeler...,"This book is typical of the obtuse rantings of her ilk. What is scary is that half of America thinks that ""liberal"" is a bad word.Like Coulter, George W. himself vilifies ""liberals"" in one breadth and then expounds on the virtues of ""liberty"" in another. Folks, these two words are more closely related than conjoined twins. Both are derived from the latin word ""liber"" which means ""free."" Therefore, a ""liberal"" is one who ""has or aspires to have liberty.""Thomas Jefferson, FDR, John F. Kennedy, Walter Cronkite and Martin Luther King were all liberals. Even Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party, had liberal views on the liberal issue that slaves should be free.Before right-wing apologists (Coulter, et al) pick a label, they should open a dictionary and see what the word really means."
1,A funny fascist?,A funny conservative is a contradiction in itself but can actually be quite amusing in a can-you-belive-this-right-wing-nut kind of way. A fascist who think's she's funny on the other hand just sends chills down my spine. This book is just plain scary.
1,More anger and hate recycled.,"Once again Mrs Coulter has found a way to pinch a few more dollars from the public by spewing her hate and anger in the form of journalism. If it makes you feel good to listen to someone create arguments for disliking people by twisting the truth then you will enjoy this. Limbaugh listenrs, assemble and read. Its your basic , dont think about the other side of the story crap that this lady is famous for, and that her fans prefer. Easier to understand, easier to be preached too. hard to actually think. better to let Anne do it for us. What a piece of junk."
4,She does it again......,Another great Ann Coulter book that makes you laugh and think. A wonderful way to get rid of everyday liberal annoyances without making a scene! Keep them coming!
1,Godzilla vs Ann Coulter's Adam's Apple,"Sweet Jeeezus, waz up with this chick's adam's apple? It belongs in a japanese sci fi flick attacking tokyo! As for the book - yeah, we know, we know...we get it already, you think liberals are rat fink commie bast'dads. Yawn, same old tired song. But what is of real intrigue here is Coulter's giant, mue-tant, radioactive prominentia laryngea, which appears to grow exponentially from book to book. If you see her in person, it glows a strange, pulsating green color. I can see a future Faux News, news flash... ""Political Pundit's Adam's Apple Mutates, Attacks Osaka"". Be afraid. Be very afraid."
5,Terrific,"Yes, this is a collection of previously printed columns. Yes, she tears into liberals and Democrats. And yes, it is both informative and so incredibly well-written that it is a great read. Humorous, and stating the truth about the absurd and the liars in government and the media. In some ways the columns from the early 2000's are prophetic, and we should have heeded the warnings."
3,How to talk to a Liberal,"I liked reading some of the columes that I never got.It was not as Instructive or as informative as the previous bookslike Treason,e.g."
4,Why Ann is so Popular,"As ever, her writing is right on! Also, she captures the intellectual debate brilliantly, which is why liberals don't care for her: they can't keep up.Well done, Ann!"
1,Can we give it negative stars?,thought I would try an older title after being attacked for my last one.. response: Can we give it negative stars? Like -5?
3,Not For All Readers,"In theory, Coulter's columns (which make up most of this book) could be seen as a blue print for Republicans to successfully debate others. The reality is that Coulter is most likely trying to maker her columns, which are difficult to find outside of her website, easily available to the public. There's nothing wrong with that, but I wouldn't recommend it to those looking for a way to refute the arguments of liberals."
1,You Must Talk to Liberals (and Conservatives),"While it is probably true that Ann Coulter ""has become the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual in years"", it may be due to the fact that she looks better in a mini skirt than does William F. Buckley, Jr. However, quick wit and a sharp tongue, albeit in an attractive feminine package, do not political wisdom make. Just as Ann has written ""How to Talk to a Liberal"", another American has made a film, which might be sub-titled ""How to Talk About a Conservative (President)"". I am speaking of Michael Moore's film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Both of these political diatribes seem to be based upon doctrinaire ideologies which care little about the truth, only about partisan perceptions of reality. It is not clear to me how democracy can survive without some spirit of civility and compromise, which seems to be lacking in both of these ideologues."
2,"I HAVE ORDERED ALL OF ANN COULTER'S BOOKS, BUT","I am a conservative, and have always admired Ann Coulter for her determined nature to say what she thinks and what she believes. But, I have also done some careful reading of history and have used my own God given brain to analyze the world the way I see it. Well lo and behold, I sign up on Ann Coulter's blog. I write my misgivings about the war in Iraq and say that I want to see the war end sooner than later. I give my reasons, and this is a free country with the First Amendment in the Constitution. Now, Ms. Coulter's blog administrators only believe in freedom of speech if you agree with them! I was banned from the blog!!!!!!!!"
5,Amunition for a conservative,This is what you have needed to wash away the hesitancy on debating a liberal. Read this and hesitate no longer.
1,Propaganda,"Before taking the author seriously, and before wasting your money, Google ""Language: A Key Mechanism of Control"" (with the quotation marks) to see what is going on."
1,Terrible,"Just terrible, Ann has no idea what she is talking about and the book is full of lies and errors. Why are people pushing hate for political gain?"
2,"I love Ann's other work, not this one","This amusing book does not really tell us how totalk to a liberal. What I was looking for is a""how-to"" book. This one just rambles."
1,"If you want to talk, learn to listen","John Dewey said, ""Democracy begins in conversation."" Hence, Coulter's relentless campaign of ridicule, which undercuts the sort of respect that's needed to have a conversation. If you want to talk to a liberal, listen for a while to what they're listening too. Radio programs like ""Democracy Now!"", ""New Dimensions"", and ""The Thom Hartmann Show"" are the sorts of things that liberals are learning from. Right-wingers who discover them are learning a lot as well.Also, right-wingers and left-wingers alike recognize that transnational corporations have acquired too much power. One poll shows that 80% of the US public feels that Big Business is perverting our culture, our media, our children and our government. To explore this issue more, I'd recommend the DVD, ""The Corporation."""
1,Pathetic,"Having just finished reading this ...ah book?, I can't honestly think of a single complimentary thing to say about Ann Coulter's ""research"" or writing ability. This may be one of the most pathetic and idiotic reads I've come across in many years. Do yourself a favor stay away from this embarrassing drivel and let's hope Ann finds a solution to her problems."
1,Nasty and spiteful,"I've seen Coulter on T.V. so I thought I'd read her book to see what the buzz was all about. I was shocked by how hateful and mean-spirited the writing was! It doesn't matter what a person's political beliefs are, this is nasty, awful stuff. I would say the same thing if it had a Left bias instead of a Right bias. America is really going down the tubes if this is the kind of thing people like to hear."
1,Unsatisfied Reader,"I have to say I was very disappointed with Ms. Coulter's latest book. A conservative myself, I was hoping to see a well-written book based in fact, a calculated attack on the liberals of America. Instead, I found myself reading a poorly-written piece of literature filled with redundant ""jokes"" and blatant lies. If you are someone looking for an easy read, maybe this is for you, but for anyone who truly wants to see humor and anti-liberalism rolled into one, I suggest he or she look further."
1,I'd give it zero if possible,"Ann, whose facts would be more compelling if they were somewhat accurate, is a master at name-calling and shallow analysis-- always helping rightwingers take no responsibility for their actions while criticizing them for not taking responsibility for their actions. And she doesn't even get the hypocracy of it all. Now, Ann, was mildly funny at one point in her sort of bulldogish way but has become increasingly incoherent. Kind of drugged out, like a literary Courtney Love.Reading Ann will lower your IQ or your money back!"
5,A Most Refreshing Read,"After listening to the 90% left wing media spew off on their ideology, it's very refreshing to see someone take a stand. A MUST READ and a breath of fresh air."
1,This title itself is misleading...,"...since it indicates Miss Coulter is instructing the reader in a dialogue. Well, no. It's more like a guide to polishing a well-worn monologue of bullet points, telling the reader what to think about former Presidents (including dead ones), triple-amputee Senators, and columnists who happen not to agree with her. (A chapter entitled ""Moby's Dick"" -- extremely classy). I picked up this book in hopes of reading what Ann says about me -- and instead found her loud disdain for liberals a comforting drone I could tune out after a while, and obviously written for pay. Doubly classy. Miss Coulter certainly fits the bill of ""a roving lawyer with a commission,"" in Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary term of another word beginning with the letter ""L."" As the saying goes, you could look it up."
5,Hate & Intolerance?,"Reviewer Matt S. stated ""Does she know what a liberal is? One who has tolerance."" Matt, buddy, your whole diatribe was full of hate and intolerance. you must have learned it from Michael Moore and Co. After all they are very tolerant and respectful to those who have opposing viewpoints (yeah, right).Then you stated, ""She is an evil person, and this book is nothing but lies (I expect her to be sued for slander), living in her own hate filled dream world."" Evil person? Again you show your hate and intolerance for another's point of view. Vilify them -- with emotional out burst, not facts -- and hope others jump on board.Matt, while I disagree with you. You have a right to your opinion and Ann Coulter has a right to her's. I would say you are ""different"" in your thinking, but that hardly makes you, me or Ms. Coulter ""evil""."
1,Who takes this seriously?,"Does anyone take this book seriously, or does everyone know it's not meant to be taken seriously? If there is any doubt in anyone's mind let me clear it up right now.This is NOT real! This is make believe! If you read this book you must remember it's for entertainment value only, this is NOT a source of valid information about the world."
1,Coulter: The High Priestess of Lunacy,"Ann Coulter...what can we say about her? I'll take her very own approach to reviewing this book. This book is evil, the work of Satan. Republicans hate America, hate reason and knowledge, hate anything but brainwash, and wallow in primitive myths. There. Brilliant review, right Annie? Annie are you ok, are you ok, Annie?P.S. At the time of this writing, there are 227 available used copies, starting at less than $1.50! That's funny."
1,terrible,"There are two main things wrong with this book.1 It just a rehash of her odd writings.(there only about twenty or so pages of new stuff here.2 she says liberal could only find a few things wrong with he facts. for example the when she says the day after dale Earnhardt the ny times did not put his death on the front page, when in fact it was on the front page of ny times. the fact ann if you mess up such a simple detail as that, how can I trust a word you say, since you have such sloppy research."
3,Nothing new here!,"I purchased this book because of the extreme opposing reviews here on amazon - I must admit, I was intrigued. After reading it, I think it is very clear why the reviews are as they are - even though I don't really feel she says anything new in this book.If you are a conservative, you will probably agree with most of what Ann Coulter talks about in the book - think she is super intelligent, that the information in her book was well researched and presents an accurate view of how things really are.If you are a liberal - the title alone will probably set you off. You will see that Ann is somewhat (tongue in cheek) less than thorough in her view of things and presents liberals in a very bad light. Again, nothing new from Ms. Coulter.So - who should buy this book? Pretty much anyone with a strong opinion should check it out. Republicans will love it, Democrats will hate it - which is probably what Ann intended all along! Have fun!"
1,Please stop ranting and actually say something,"Yes - I read the book. Yes, I now know many of her ideas have since been proven completely wrong. However, above the fact she has been proven wrong (WMD's) - I cannot believe she considers this anything other than a plethora of ranting obstreperously told fallacies. After the first chapter, I had to find out where she went to school because I expected that she might not have been as well educated as her credentials contend. Wow, if this is a conservative- sign me up for the other side. She is a complete lunatic who spends more time ranting and raving than actually making a point. Hey Ann - think of a theses and prove it. They should have taught you that at Cornell."
1,Rubbish. She's just trying to make a buck though.,"How to enrage a liberal. Talk like a fascist and then publish a book that sells well. Yep, that'll do it. Forget democracy, equal rights, secularism -- let's just transform this nation into another Iran. Please...."
3,Interesting presentation of facts and wit,"This is the second book I've read by Ann Coulter and enjoyed it almost as must as Treason. Knowing ""how"" she speaks makes the books more enjoyable. She is not only very smart, but witty too. I am now reading ""slander"", which is great.By the way: I am not a republican."
4,Amazing book,"I acutally read the entire book unlike almost all of the people who gave this book a bad rating. Ann Coulter is a Conservative genius. She pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else. She is intelligent, and makes very good arguements. The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last chapter was a bit dull. This is some of her earlier writing, and therefore was not the best. She should have put this chapter closer to the beginning, so it wouldn't be the last thing the reader remembers.Other than the last chapter, this book is filled with great humor, while still being informative and making her arguements. She includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias (even though they say they don't)...this book should be on everyone's must read list!!!"
5,Ann Coulter 2008,"Ann must have really hit close to home on this one. The seminar reviewers are literally crawling out of the woodwork. How much is the DNC paying you guys to slander Miss Coulter?Do any of you actually have jobs or is Americorps, writing bogus reviews, and trying to disrupt Conservative talk radio your fulltime gig?If you'd read this book, you'd understand the truth that she speaks. That is Ann habla la verdad! If you'd put your preconceived views on hold, open your mind, the education could begin.By the way, we choose our books based on your lowest reviews and highest slander factor. Do you really think you are persuading anybody? I wonder..."
1,Gives a bad name to blondes everwhere...,Ann just gets dumber and dumber with every word. I'm glad she's a poster child for the extreme and unpatriotic right wing wackos everywhere. Liberals like their chicks with brains and a pair of legs bigger than chopsticks helps too. Would pick 0 stars if possible...
1,Biased and distorted personal view,It was impossible to read this book....After 35 pages I was completely disgusted.
2,"Hey, at least she looks hot","Many people have noticed that she is not a good writer, but I think she knows it too. That's why she likes to show off her figure and hair. I don't know what she will do in 10 years, but for now I have to give it two stars just for that!"
1,short skirted weirdo,"This woman is making money out of being mean,ugly and inaccurate.Anyone who buys or reads this book must be a grumpy old nut case.This book and her views have no value and no merit.I only wish that I could have given thid book zero stars because that what it deserves."
1,What is wrong with you people?,"Enough!!! with the hate speech from the Radical Facsist Wing of America.Why is it that when I see this woman on the television I want to vomit?Ok, it's not easy to make the bestseller list as a real conservative with real arument. BUt if you're a bigoted racist using inflamatory slander toward those who don't share your absolutist beliefs, unsensitive and ignorant of all world cultures other than middle aged life-size barbie dolls, and utterly incoharant to put any objectivite reasoning into your crafty rhetoric, it will certainly give you the boost to sell to the max.Why is that America?Why do you read such garbage??And what is with all the anger from the right when they have control over every institution in the federal government???"
1,Waste of Time,"I went through half the book before I realized this woman is actually trying to be serious. All she does is throw insults at the left and at Muslims and poorer countries. She lacks any truth or fact or research, just any sort of backing to her statements. The world according to Ann Coulter is a silly narcissistic power hungry world where people must grovel at her feet."
5,Hilarious!,"The things most people think about but never say are encapsulated in this literary masterpiece. This is a collection of articles on everything political. Liberals, conservatives, and everyone in between can enjoy hours of laughter and food for thought from Ann Coulter's sarcasitic yet persuasive banter."
1,Disaster on pages..full of hatred and agression.,"Not only are her arguments and conlusions on topics conflicting between themselves, but, although as an American I respect and defend the right of anyones opinion, I take offense of her visions of America and the system. Her views and message are full of hatred and segregation; instead of uniting she is dividing; again, who is SHE to tell you what to think? Don't waste your money..I did, and threw the book away."
1,Extremist,"She is the Michael Moore of the Right wing, confused and hateful. This book is simply a publication of her personal vendetta against the left wing. Propaganda starts with people like Ann; I suggest that if you read this, take all the information at the same value as the Sunday comic section, simply made for amusement. She has a goal of making people believe in what she thinks; how about thinking for yourself and spare yourself from reading this garbage. Do understand I am not a liberal, I am an independent with a combination of liberal and conservative views/beliefs, incase you were wondering."
1,"Remember, it's just a joke.","In January 2006, Ann Coulter said, """"We need somebody to put rat poisoning in Justice Stevens' creme brulee. That's just a joke, for you in the media.""Lovely. Inciting/advocating the murder of a federal official, conspiracy to assassinate or assault a Supreme Court Justice, is a violation of 18 USC sec. 351. I won't hold my breath waiting for Ann Coulter to be arrested.We need somebody to take a baseball bat to Ann Coulter. That's just a joke for you reading Amazon.com.We need somebody to stick a shotgun in Coulter's mouth. That's just a joke for you in the media."
5,Great book if you know how to read,Great Book! I learned that in order to talk to liberals - I must have a brain and hopefully an education.
1,Coulter needs counseling,"My curiosity was aroused after seeing Ms Coulter in a recent live interview. She is an obviousy bright, well-educated woman, but her deep well of anger and venom concerned me. It seemed so bizarre. She rants about ""liberals"" and all the problems they supposedly cause, but the fact is that Republicans have controlled the national agenda for most of the past three decades and have had complete control of all three branches of the federal government for six of the past seven years.Where, exactly, is this terrible liberal threat coming from?This book made it clear. She sets up strawmen to tear down. But it's an emotionally dangerous game to play. Imagining things and then working oneself into a rage over a self-generated delusion can be self-destructive. I hope that her career as a public spectacle doesn't end badly for her."
5,Savage political wit with weight,"How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must) by Ann Coulter is absolutely her best book yet. Clever with a savage, sharp wit this book made me laugh out loud and feel very glad that I will never be the target of Coulter's sharp tongue. This compilation of her columns jumps around chronologically, but follows a thematic format. Reading her columns published in the days and weeks after 9/11 and the 2000 election brought back a lot of memories, but also educated me. Coulter is smart and doesn't pull any punches, but occasionally she gets hung up on an issue, like Clinton's impeachment. While I don't agree with all of her political stances, reading her makes me look at my views anew and gives me support for those we do agree on. If Coulter keeps improving this way, I can't wait to read her new book Godless coming out next month."
1,Ann Coulter is a fascist.,"People who like this book probably think concentration camps are a good idea (Coulter does), or that this [rhymes with witch] is being funny when she suggests we invade non-Christian countries and convert them.That sounds a lot like Stalinism: invade and convert them to communism. I suppose people who are fans of Coulter think such sentiments are okay as long as the infidels are being converted to follow Jesus and the free market.Coulter has zero credibility among reasonable and intelligent people. Since most of her fans are drooling troglodytes, I'll make my point clear. What you can conclude from this statement is this: if you like Ann Coulter, you are a cryptofascist toady who is neither reasonable nor intelligent.Amazon provides no selection for Zero stars. There should be at least that, though this book deserves a negative star rating for its decidedly un-American content."
1,Very Poor,"Tries to be funny but is really stupid. I got through the book but not without many tries, kept dozing off. She thinks she is hot stuff but rather dull with little to offer. Some of her ""jokes"" are very old. I don't know if she is trying to be a comic or a lawyer or a glamor girl. Sorry, she is none of the above. Save you money on this one. There are many responsible conserative books to pick from you don't need this one."
1,Talk is good.....better than war,Talk means exchange of ideas...Discussion. I'm willing to talk to the other side and all between. AC has written better.
1,"What a shame that this book was allowed to go to print,",Ms. Coulter has enough hatred in her to make up an entire Nazi army.Such a waste of a mind that could have been used for a good cause. Read this and get ill.
2,Pure Arrogance,"Ann Coulter will shout you down if you dare to differ with her thoughts about politics. Reading her book(quickly)and seeing her on the many sound-byte TV shows is painful. Reasonable, thoughtful, intelligent political talk is what is desperately needed in our country at this time. The right and the left will have to come together in the center to help heal our Country. However, you are not going to get this from Ann Coulter. She thrives on trying to divide the Country with her antics."
1,Perhaps the most hilarious thing I have read in my life,"To summarize this book: Liberals are evil, irrational, and stupid. French people are chauvinist pigs. If you are Muslim, you are a terrorist bent on destroying America and American ideals of freedom (there's irony here somewhere).Since Al-Qaida is a Muslim terrorist organization that must be hunted down and destroyed, all Muslims must be hunted down and destroyed!Since Timothy Mcveigh was a Christian exected for killing 168 people (including 19 children), all Christians must be executed!Oh wait..."
5,No wonder they hate you!!,"No wonder they hate you!Ann Coulter has a natural ability to remove all the jargon, propaganda and double talk and get right to the point.Liberals hate her because she exposes their every tactic in the light of truth. The fact that they despise her so much shows how right she is. Point for point Ann hits the nail on the proverbial liberal head every single time and points out their hypocrisies, inconsistencies and irrational thinking without apology. It takes courage and guts to REALLY speak your mind and go against the overwhelming liberal media and Ann does this in a most concise, articulate and sometimes humorous way.No wonder they hate you because deep down they know you are 100% right"
1,amazingly stupid,"I consider myself moderate, and know decent conservatives who are truly concerned about the state of affairs our government is in and want what is best for people without being religious bible-thumpers or the like.Unfortunately, Ms. Coulter is not one of these sane conservatives. Some of the things that come out of her mouth just befuddle me. One thing that stuck in my mind is how she said that the best way to solve the problems in the Middle East is to force everyone there to convert to Christianity.... Really? Really? And yet this woman has plenty of followers who just love and agree with her. This is not the only wacky thing she says in this book... read this book as a joke to laugh at the things she says... or just shake your head in sadness that someone could believe such stupid and hateful things."
1,But how do you talk to a crazy woman who hates everyone?,"I don't even know what to say about this book. Coulter does not seem to want to open a dialogue. She seems to want to build higher and thicker whatever walls there are between conservatives and liberals. It is obvious that the anger and venom she inks these pages with is merely an attempt to be noticed. I am embarrassed that I have read this.For a woman she sure does have a large adam's apple. Hmm. How conservative could ""she"" be?Minus a star for the hatred this book espouses.Minus a star for her rehashing old articles and presenting them as if they are new.Minus one star for her adam's apple.Minus one star for her generalizations about everyone.Minus one star for embarrassing me.Add one star so I could leave a comment.Minus a star from yourself if you read this book. Minus three stars if you buy it."
5,Thank you Ann,"Great book learn alot as always do with Ann Coulter.Even if you do not like her you should get this forair flights , good book."
2,Better than counting sheep,"You'd have to a cable news junkie to be familiar with all the people and incidents mentioned in this book. The first part of the book, the part you can read in the online preview, is very good. But unfortunately, the rest is long and boring. I tried to keep reading but it just droned on and on. zzzzzzzzz..."
2,The Cover Tells It All!,"Dressing up in black leather rehearsing for a role in a bio of DeSade is certainly great advertising for the ditto head crowd likely to buy this poor excuse for a book! Bring out the whips and chains! And this for a spokewoman for family values! But the best thing about this book is it surely shows the true, and very unfortunate status, of much of present US conversatism. By the time the author has expressed her sarcastic contempt for all and any who do not agree, we should realize that that the emperor(ess) wears no clothes..(except the black maiden dungeon outfit). But what a great money making and marketing scheme, which is what the movement is really about!"
1,Disgrace and complete rightwing bias !,Would you trust a traitor like Ann Coulter to dictate what's best for America even when she admits that she strongly believes that anyone in America who doesn't agree with her is more dangerous than Al Quaeda? The only goal of this book is to get more people to hate one another and further exploit each others' weaknesses. Coulter would have failed miserably with this kind of nonsensical writing if she were to be writing this baloney even in Regent University !
2,Waste of trees,"I recieved this book as a gift from a neighbour. Regardless of being conservative or liberal, in my opinion this book is positively a piece of trash written by a closed-minded person for closed-minded people. It's one thing to have your values but quite another to think of people different from you as mindless idiots who live to destroy what you care for, as Ms. Coulter so breathlessly insists. I suspect that the reason why conservatism is losing power fast, as a previous reviewer wrote, is because they are stereotyped by many as arrogant self-righteous Christians who refuse to accept new ideas no matter how logically sound they are. I place the blame on people who write books like this. But at least it's written well."
1,Babbling jibberish,"Just another attack book by Ann Coulter that is nothing but babbling jibberish without any support of facts. She uses footnotes to make it look like its researched, but if you check her ""facts,"" they just aren't there. I imagine this will be read and cherished by the dittoheads that listen to Rush Limbaugh, but no one with a brain will accept anything this woman writes as fact."
1,The Death of Reasoned Discourse,"In the late 19th century; William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr, and some of their acquaintances founded the Metaphysical Club. The goal of its members was to discuss issues of interest in a reasoned fashion. The club gave rise to a school of philosophy called Pragmatism; which has as its central tenent that ideas of themselves are neither right or wrong, instead they are tools we use to investigate the world around us. In this latest book, Coulter shows that she has no interest in any discourse, only in winning. Justice Holmes (by no means a liberal) believed that certainty leads to violence. Coulter's books by their very assertion of certainty become a justification for ignoring, belittling, and ultimately restricting those with whom she disagrees. This attitude weakens the very foundations that our republic was founded on. Better to spend your money on ""The Metaphysical Club."""
1,Trash,"I couldn't believe how insane this book was. I read it as a joke, and it turned out to be just that."
1,Oh Ann save us from ourselves,Ann's MO is not so seamless. Anyone who disagrees with her is some liberal terrorist who works for the New York Times and voted for Clintons Penis (Twice). This book will suit people who are unwilling to take in information that does not support their current belief system. It has the fundamental flaw of suggesting that a purely conservative doctrine is the way to save/build a nation. There is no historical precedent of either purely liberal or conservative approaches working all that well. I would say Ann is a great at selling snake oil but that would be insulting to snake oil sales people everywhere.
1,What a hack,"I'm surprised that people who actually buy her books are literate. Maybe Coulter's books are just status symbols, like going to the right church or being a hateful conservative? Maybe her books are just for show? I think Coulter's books are useful for identifying stupid people; beyond that--they're nothing more than a waste of space."
5,How to talk to a Lib,Ann is one of the best. She thinks and talks like me. I'm a 60-year-old smart aleck and I was here first. No wonder libs hate her. She tells the truth.
5,Liberal Reviewers Are Proving Her Point,"These incessant, unnecessary and foolish 1 star reviews from liberals are just proving her point. First of all...liberals have no argument regarding John Kerry's messed up life, or this wonderful detailed...and well informed book.This book was written for you sick people! She is trying to clean up America from the common sense we lost when John Kerry was elected as a candidate against George Bush.So come on, and get real. I learned how to talk to a liberal."
2,"Coulter At It Again--Same Ol, Same Ol","This is a collection of Coulter's columns from ""Human Events"" and her syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate. This series of essays provides you with a lot more breadth but not as much depth as the typical book topic.Ann Coulter is at her best or worst, depending upon your perspective, once again leveling liberals with a rather cranked vocabulary, to say the least. Her writing (and I assume speaking) style leaves me cold--I think rants weaken arguments not strengthen them--but her points of view are worth considering and from time to time she gets off a one-liner that is downright funny.Would I recommend this book--as opposed to others worthy of your time and money? Nah. Would I go across the street to hear Coulter speak? Nah."
1,"Ann, She-Wolf of the SS","I compare this pundit and her followers to what PETA members are to the left: Pure stupidity and mindless forcing of unproved beliefs upon others who have already learned that one can pick and choose their poltical beliefs based on informed decision making.If you like to pidgeonhole yourself as a conservative and need idiotic statistics with little fact behind them to validate your existance, then by all means buy and try to read this book. This book replaces intelligent rational conservatives with-which one (right or left-minded) can actually discuss things, with idiotic ""dittohead"" morons who spit out the rehashed opinions of such purile pundits. I call it NASCARification of the right.On the flipside the text is actually small print (unlike Bill O's...which I believe is meant for 5-year-olds.)"
1,Oh Boy,"Self rightous conservatives will be beaming with pride after reading this. AC with one hand tied behind her back runs circles around those foolish enough to call themselves free thinkers(liberals). BTW, she likes the late Senator Joe McCarthy. You decide."
2,I hope most Republicans are not like Ann!,"First of all, living in St. Louis, I have never read Ann due to my local openly Democratic newspaper. Second, I was taken in by the catchy title. Third, when buying the book, I failed to note that 98% of the book is previously published material. Great job getting paid twice for one effort! Shame on me. Fourth, I consider myself a moderate Republican. Now for the book. I was expecting provocative, insightful, humorous, pithy, intelligent, well researched writing that would blow up the crap spumed by most liberal Democrats. Instead, what I got was cheap, unimaginative, name-calling crap spumed an equally extreme ""journalist"". Borrowing from a Steve Martin routine, if I could have one wish, it would be for extremist of all political pursuations to be taken to an island and let fend for themselves. Now that would be a reality show that would really bring in the ratings!"
1,Yikes,"If there were any nudie pics, I might raise it to one-and-a-half stars, but that's about it. This book doesn't deserve my time to write an extensive review, and everyone else already summed it up, so I'll be brief. We have a PR & marketing machine in place- called the Bush administration- that's done enough damage. So, PLEASE quit feeding nonsense like this to the gullible portion of our once-great country!!!"
1,One star is too much,"Words cannot describe my disgust with this woman. She is a cow and knows nothing about liberals or soceity. She does not back up her arguments. Instead, she spews and uses childish backtalk. And, despite what all of the five-star reviews are saying, liberals are not ""afraid of the truth."" Rather, it is the conservatives who ran a tastless commercial of John Kerry windsurfing when Fallujah was in flames. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, unless you feel like puking."
1,She strikes again.,"Many criticize reviewers for not reading the book beforeheand. I tried, belive me, I tried. But some of the things she was saying about me and my ilk were so maddenning that they made my head spin.Besides the fact that dividing humanity into a hated class of liars and an endlessly good group of people is notoriously bad for society to function, her all-or-nothing outlook brings down political and social discourse into shrill namecalling. Isn't that what she's railing against?"
2,Hurray!,"Yes, this book is almost entirely reprints of Coulter's columns, but don't despair! It's still loaded with all of the elitist facism her fans have come to love.Especially refreshing are Coulter's diatribes about the poor, who she claims bring it all on themselves.Hurray for deep thinking!"
1,Bush Is Lincoln and Kerry McClellan,"In her BN interview Ms. Coulter equates Buch to Lincoln and Kerry to McClellan. Even more amazingly she calls McClellan a great military leader. Any student of the civil war would not call ""little Mac"" a great leader. If anything, he was a pompous, dressed up popinjay, who refused combat even when the numbers were in his favor. Well, unlike Bush, at least he cared about his troops."
5,She is a genius! Everything she says in this book is true,"I have never read a book(yes I have read a lot) that had this much information about the screwed up left. If you have any questions about how the left is destroying America with abortion, lack of morals, etc. this is the book. WOW!!!"
1,"go ahead, waste your money!","It's a great career, just make stuff up, be nasty and sarcastic and there are sure to be enough frightened and insecure people to buy your books."
1,Horrible,"This entire book is filled with unbacked claims, another naive account of what she had to say. Totally out of touch with the general society. I'd love her to challenge a liberal and watch her book be spit out. Does she know what a liberal is? One who has tolerance. Go ask every person in this country, ask them if people deserve to live, ask them if they deserve a living wage, if they deserve health care, if our children should go to good schools. She is an evil person, and this book is nothing but lies (I expect her to be sued for slander), living in her own hate filled dream world."
1,Debating Conservatives: Waste of Time,"Doctor heal thyself. As she races towards fifty, maybe if Ms Coulter learned to talk to liberals it might provide her biological clock a chance. BTW, she is not even honest enough about her real age. You are not going unearth a genuine man if you keep rubbing elbows with Bill Bennet, Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly. Look at Mary Matlin. She had to go outside the republican party to find a stud. .Finally, in my discussions with conservatives, their views are based on beliefs. While liberal views have been shaped by facts. I am not going to waste my time debating the merits of intelligent design with a born again conservative."
1,How To Talk To A Liberal...,"...the same way you would talk to anyone else. Is there nothing more to a person than political opinions? Coulter throws around the words Liberal and Democrat like they are swears. All she does is attack anyone with a different opinion from hers. If she is so patriotic then why does she promote hating her fellow Americans? Her books aren't the truth. They are simply Conservative propaganda, used to brainwash people with no political views."
1,Oh! Found out I'm not a liberal after all!,"Before looking over this book, I thought I was a liberal. I was wrong! I have a job and do not live with my parents. I love America. The government already takes more of my money than I want to part with (it's what they do with it that I object to), I love being part of a society (in fact would rather walk down a sidewalk than hide in an SUV, would rather know my neighbors than shoot at them). So, although I'm a card carrying Green I must have been mistaken that I'm liberal. Thank you, Ann, for setting me straight!"
1,THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT!,"It's this simple: Read the following list. If any or all of those things apply to you, get this book.1) You think gay marriage is something that is wrong and simply must be fought, rather than something that is inevitable and therefore simply must be accepted;2) You think our huge problem with illegal immigration is not largely due to the fact that we as a society have for a long time made a tremendous profit off the labor and hardware those people provide (that the only reason we let them in and let them stay is because it pays off for us too);3) You think the Bush tax cuts are an essential part of keeping our nation from further economic ruin.IF THOSE THINGS APPLY TO YOU, GET THIS BOOK! ANN IS THE ONE!"
1,A fresh look !,"In Coulter’s new book I expected pretty much the same old witty, sarcastic liberal bashing Ann but I must say, “Wow” what a change! Although the author in the past has accused liberals of pretty much everything, in her new book Ann reaches out to the liberal cause and encourages conservatives to initiate dialogue with the “other side”. After reading through the book it would seem that Coulter has had a change of heart, and while one could hardly expect her to take up the liberal torch she does get the point across that the only way to build a better country is through conservatives and liberals communicating with each other. The book is full of helpful tips on how conservatives can initiate this process and plenty of examples on how the two sides can compromise on a whole array of issues. Perhaps a different side to Coulter that might put off a lot of her loyal followers but still a very good read."
3,Didn't Enjoy As Much As I Thought I Would,"I like most of Ann Coulter's books. She always makes me laugh and even if I don't agree she makes me think and/or research things. This book is copies of a lot of her columns. I didn't realize that before I bought the book. I don't read most of her columns and don't even know where I could because my local paper doesn't print them. But a lot of them went back to 2001 and I have heard her thoughts on the subjects before. So it was a let down for me. However, she's still hillarious. Maybe a little over the top but very funny. Would recommend to get as a bargain book or from the library."
1,Nothing new,"I'm a great fan of Ann Coulter. It is her cutting and ""in your face"" style that is terrific. Why would I rate this book one star? Because where have I been told that after the first 22 pages it is simply a conglomeration of past articles? Frankly, most of them I've read. So what does this mean? It means that she actually newly wrote about 30 pages, copied a bunch of articles and collected 18 bucks. This was done with no indication that that is what was happening. If a liberal had done the same thing she would have in some way found a funny slashing comment."
3,"The Bright Light Knows No Pain: Monkey, Squirrel, Kiwi","If this were not the book that it is, it would be a different book. Fortunately it provides everything you might think it would but then you have the answer to your question. It is the answer that drives us. Seek and ye shall find, or if not, then wander in darkness, mumbling to yourself ""why me, why me, why me, oh monkey, squirrel, kiwi."""
1,"More Hate, Fear and Lies by Ann","Ann along with many of the other worshipers of Hate, Fear and Lies (Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Pat O'Reily, John Hagee, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell,the people who buy into and enjoy this garbage , Newt Gingrich, etc,etc)is at it again making a ton of cash from her fellow worshipers of Hate,Fear and Lies. If you are one of those who agrees and enjoys Ann's rantings, you should also pick up Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, or borrow it from someone at your next worship session."
1,More of the same,"The Queen of Swill dishes out more garbage and out and out lies. I'm positive there's a special place in hell reserved just for her. On a positive note, the book can be equally enjoyed by Republicans and the recently lobotomized."
3,Needed a good copy editor.....,"And, perhaps, an editor. Ms. Coulter speaks better than she writes, and certainly should know that while hyperbole is a useful tool, too many of those, plus rim-shots, turn me off. Moreover, her grammatical errors are disturbing and begin immediately with the first paragraph, Chapter One.I like Anne Coulter, and realize that she clearly believes that in order to make a point, one must be brave."
1,"Ann , Please!","Ann, You have made millions, writing ""FICTION"" the Right-wingers love your hate. This book is truly, Anti-American, Just like YOU, just like all of the rest of your books!America, Love it or leave it!Tom in Texas"
5,How can so many brains be in one body ?,"I am amazed at the grasp she has of facts and information. The best wish of Democrats is to ignore her (like the facts) and hope they just go away.I am apalled at the hatred of ""Fundamental Christians"" openly preached by PBS, NPR, the Democratic Party and much of Gollywood!It wasn't the Baptist Church that brought down the Trade Towers, Killed Bobby Kennedy or cheered in public places when it all happened.Thank you Ann Coulter for just telling the truth, with details and insight.Shollyman"
1,"Arrogant, Arrogant, Arrogant","Ann Coulter is the most arrogant, stupidest conservative [...]on the face of the earth. Why anybody would waste their time listening to what she has to say is beyond me."
5,A Treatise on Talk and Language,"Taking her inspiration from some of the developments in language studies within humanities departments since the 1970s, Anne Coulter unearths the sedimented contigency of many oft prattled 'truisms' with a Derridean alacrity."
1,BLONDS ARE DUMB,"ANN PROVES THAT BLONDES ARE DUMB OR DUMBER THEN OTHERS.IF YOU SUBSTITUTE THE WORDS REPUBLICAN & DITTO HEAD FOR THE WORDS LIBERAL & DEMOCRATE, YOU'LL FIND THAT THE SHOE FITS.ON THE OTHER HAND IF SHE IS LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK, SHE'S PRETTY CUTE."
2,Disappointing,"I have come to expect a lot out of Anne Coulter. It didn't happen this time. Not only was the book made up of only half new material and half old columns, but I did not sense that the content matched the book's title. I kept looking for clever things to say to my liberal friends, but did not find them. Sorry."
1,Disgusting,"I know i may be feeding her evidence into this book, but I feel this book is just a bunch of ranting. Most of everything she accusess liberals of doing, conservatives are doing. Lying, Stealing, Blocking Media (watch Fox lately?), and over all just being stupid. Really, Conservative people are all of this. It is this kind of politcal extremity that just makes me mad. Some liberals may be dumb, but some conservatives are as well. I quote Dan Quayle, ""It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.""If you want the same effect as portrayed in this book...Watch FOX. Simply Disgusting..."
1,Crazy Conservatives Gone Wild.,"Bleah. I can't believe people think she's this ubergreat writer with all this wisdom to share, when most of what she has to say boils down to liberals being horrible baby-eating, soul stealing weenies, or that Clinton had an affair and is now the epitome of evil. Any liberal who wrote like this would be shot down in flames, but I suppose this book reflects today's ideology of hate and the idea that liberals are just mentally inferior and need to be smacked around a little. Oh, and they're subhuman traitors who should be killed. Way to support 'freedom', lady.The sheer amount of rabid, frothing hatred in this book is so great, that if burned, this book would provide warmth for about 5 villages in Africa for a week. Sadly, most people embrace it. Ann Coulter is little more than sarcasm propped up against a cardboard box of hatred and ignorance.Oh, and I want the hour I spent on this book back."
2,What?,"Ann Coulter is so into herself that she never even stop to analyze what she was saying. She completely skips over points in history that are significant in her accounts of what happened. In some reviews they calim that ""her anger makes her dead on"".....B.S. Her anger proves that the only way to get her point across is to be in your face. Any sane person can figure out that anger only means defense, that leads to cause. If your right, why be defensive. When I know that I am right I don't argue or get angry because I know! This book is well written. I don't deny her passion and intelligence, but she needs to let get off her opinion and grasp reallity. In social reallity one opinion means no more than another. Balancing truth vs opinion is hard to do but she is a smart lady and she should figure it out."
1,She is retarded,"Overly conservative to the point of lunacy, her only option to sell a book is to put her full body picture on the cover and hope that someone who forgot their glasses picks it up that day and thinks she's hot. She may very well be the naughty postergirl for the GOP, but at the same time, I am no more tempted to buy St. Pauli Girl beer because of the drawing of the woman on the bottle."
3,Typical Yet Intriguing,"If you are a fan of Ann Coulter this a fun read. Although the material is somewhat dated as it has been some time since the original release, I found this book to be entertaining due to the author's wit and humor, and of course, unique style. In typical Ann Coulter fashion there are valuable insights sprinkled between the rants and attacks that you may find useful regardless of your political persuasion - for example ""What people do with their money is more important than what they say."" There is also a touching tribute to JFK junior. Standard fare for those who have read other Ann Coulter works, however there are also some interesting insights into the author's life and background that I found fascinating."
1,How to Read the Ramblings of a Nutcase (If You Must),"Ms. Coulter barely has a grasp on reality let alone the English language. Anyone can write about ""statistics"" if they don't care if their readers bother to question their veracity. It's sad that we live in country that still questions the value of liberal thinking, but sadder still that we live pay money to support the pseudo-career of half-wits like this author. She writes because she wants a career, not because she cares about Americans... and we're to blame for reading her drivel."
1,more lies from the right,This is one of the most polemic books out there. What ever happened to compassionate -conservative. This is more the same slop the conservative right has dishing out during the last four years-and is an excellent example of how dogmatic the right has gotten.
1,Polarizing and dangerous,"Ann Coulter continues in her crusade to further shout down and drown out dissenting opinions with ad hominem attacks of the basest and most inflammatory sort. Rather than fostering a full and respectful dicussion of the issues and the free exchange of ideas in this democracy, Coulter instead actively encourages the throwing of rhetorical tomatoes at ""the enemy"". When insult replaces civil argument, we all suffer. And when people with differing political ideas are persecuted and targeted as the enemy, democracy itself breaks down. From what I have seen thus far, Coulter's few well-reasoned arguments are dramatically overshadowed by her vitriol. Save your money - you'll likely hear the few interesting soundbytes worth reading during the talk show promotional tour she is on."
3,Wrong title,"I love Ann Coulter and have just started reading her books. Unfortunatley, she doesn't publish as well as she speaks. This book is good but doesn't match the title. I was hoping for examples of how to cut down liberal biases and nonsense and how to help them understand the errors of their ways. This is simply a compilation of Ann's past published articles. It does give a bit of insight to her but I was hoping for quick jabs and punches that I could use."
1,Don't Buy This - It's All Online!,Ann Coulter can't write - as every critic (and regretful reader) in America has realized. Unfortunately I bought this book and am still amazed at how BAD it is! Coulter pedals hate - and a grossly misinformed and ignorant hate at that.If you still want to read it - the bulk of this book is available on her website or online. Google this garbage - don't buy it!
1,"She's a divider, not a uniter","The title of the book summarizes what is wrong with it. Ideologues like Coulter are dividing Americans against each other so that they are shouting at each other in anger, rather than engaging in rational discussions of the issues. This has a very bad effect on American society and leads to gridlock and a failure to solve the country's problems.I'm strongly on the liberal side on most (but not all) issues, but I enjoy talking with people who disagree with me, as long as the converstation is kept on a polite, rational basis and does not deteriorate to shouting. I think if one only talks to people who agree with you, one doesn't ever really learn anything. Speaking to people who disagree with you and challenge your preconceptions is a valuable learning experience. But for this to work, one has to really LISTEN to what the other side is saying.If I were to write a book on this issue, I would entitle it ""How to Talk to a Conservative, Because you Really Should."""
1,How to talk to Ann Coulter's adams apple.,"this book is not only a joke but, down right wrong! I have read parts of it. in a library. the teabagger GOP party. is the worlds dumbest. no wonder, the red states have the worst curriculum in the nation! not only is she a racist. but, doesn't understand that poverty creates crime. in Sweden. less crime. why? less poverty."
5,My pilgrimage too,"This is John's pilgrimage and so it is ours too. Along the way he bares his soul with questions, sometimes unanswerable, sometimes enlightening.""Sunset"" is receiving your Medicare card in the mail -- how did the journey go by so fast? John is facing the inevitable, as we all do. But he's turning the corner to a richer and deeper spiritual life and this is so evident in his poetry.Of all John's books, this is my favorite (so far).(Excuse me, I think my Social Security check just arrived.)"
5,Scholarly Without Being Overwhelming....,"Ryrie, perhaps best known for the Ryrie Study Bible, has here written a verse-by-verse Revelation commentary noteworthy for being sufficiently detailed and scripturally sound without being too overwhelming for the average layperson. For readers with a mindset to study but little or no background in Revelation, I recommend this solid commentary. Also, this updated edition has quite a few helpful charts. If after this book more depth is desired, try other dispensational commentaries such as those of Walvoord, Thomas, Couch (ed.), or Newell. (For those familiar with eschatology lingo, if you are a preterist, historicist, or postrib premillenialist in your endtimes interpretation, you will not like this book, since it is written from a pre-trib, pre-millenialist viewpoint.)"
5,Grab Your Bible,This is a great book as long as you have your Bible out too. We obviously want our Bibles handy but the one thing that would make this book even better for me is having the scripture along side the commentary. I still gave it 5 stars because it is a no nonsense approach to helping you better understand Revelation.On a side note; I find it good to have the Ryrie Study Bible handy when you are going through this book. They compliment each other. Much of the commentary in this book echoes the Ryrie Study Bible but there is additional content here and there as well.
2,Wasn't a good item,"I purchased this Texas Instruments Graphing Calculator on 9/19/2011, and it already broke. I had to buy another one. A waste of money"
1,Graphics Calculator,"I purchased this calculator for statistics, and didn't purchase it directly form Amazon, but from a seller on Amazon in the used category. Unfortunately for me, the seller wasn't honest in the item description. I didn't mind that it came with some scratches or engraved with some words on it from the previous owner, but I didn't appreciate purchasing a broken calculator. I can't give a review for the itme since I received it broken (and arrived a week later than it should have), but I will rate my review on the seller, which is why it is makred low."
1,Not worth my money,I am very dissappointed in my purchase. I am unable to use it at all a the screen is so light I cannot see anything on it. I dont this this was rated correctly as it is not even in working condition
2,Not a good one,"If you don't have to buy a TI calculator, go for a CASIO, they are logically easier to use. I used to have CASIO during my school and college and when I bought this calculator I recognized that these TIs are not a good opponent for CASIOs."
3,ti82 graphing calculator,"I hated this calculator. There is nothing wrong with it, it arrived as stated. The book I ordered to go with it was the wrong one and it proved difficult to use with out it. It was an older model as well. I ended up giving it away to another math student and got one more user friendly."
5,Calculator,for people looking for one for their teens for school it was exactly the price and style we were looking for. also it only took a few days to get it!
3,Good but it's no longer supported by TI,"Texas Instruments no longer makes or supports this calculator, the bottom line being TI-83 Plus. While the TI-82 will do just about everything that T-83 does as far as computation and graphing and it can be had (used) at a fraction of the T-83 price, I decided that my kids will be using T-83s for several reasons:- the ability to easy connect to a computer (T-82's interface is more antiquated)- the ability to download programs from Texas Instruments- ROM upgrades from TI- TI-83 Plus is the de facto standard in high schools and collegesSo, if price is a BIG issue a used TI-82 is almost as good as the TI-83 but if you don't mind paying about $75 more, I would definitely take the TI-83.I will be using the TI-82 myself and I will rate it 3-stars as in ""it's okay"" but my kids are getting TI-83's."
4,Easy To Use,"This is a great TI calculator expecialy for Pre-Algebra/Algebra students. You can do long math equasions with the press of a button. You can load cool programs on it that help you do lots of math functions, or play games."
5,graphing calculator,ok so there is an app for this but for those that do not have androids and smart phones a good old fashioned calculator is just what you need to get you through some of those high school courses and this one worked great! Good Price Good shipping. Thanks
2,The Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter),"Very disjointed. Procedures explained DO NOT always work unless you toggle between 8 and 16 bit modes, etc. Kelby does not tell you what mode to be in when he's explaining the trick. You have to figure out on your own where he's starting from. VERY FRUSTRATING attempting to follow his steps when commands are grayed out or not there."
4,Photoshop for the masses,"This is a good book for a photographer looking to get into photoshop. It contains all the info needed to get up and rolling with the program. The book is, however, very basic and individuals with already decent Photoshop skills and ones who want all the details will be dissapointed.On the positive side, Kelby presents techniques that are effective, real world and easy to follow. Among them, cropping based on the rule of thirds and finding a neurtal gray in a picture were tips I found particularly useful.Potential negatives are the author's humor which is dispersed liberally throughout the book and the fact that there is little explanation provided with the techniques.One technique I'd recommend to a potential reader who finds Kelby's brand of humor offensive/annoying is to ignore the book's intro and the intro to each chapter and about 90% of his ""humor"" is eliminated. This made my reading experience more enjoyable and productive."
4,This book tells you how to get things done,"This is a great book for actually getting things done in Photoshop CS2. Scott does a great job showing you step by step how to accomplish a variety of ""high-end"" digital photo tasks in CS2. Although many times I did not actually know ""what"" I was doing, the results are always spectacular. The section on creating gallery prints was very helpful since I have since created several gallery prints which are suitable for framing.The color illustrations and the overall format of this book make for efficient and easy reading. Scott's humorous style make reading this book very enjoyable.I think this book plus another ""introduction to"" Photoshop CS2 would be a perfect combination."
5,Entertaining and Outstanding Teacher,I would like to know the author. He adds so much fun to what could be a dull topic. I find myself chuckling while learning just what I need as an enthusiatic photographer. I have too many books on digital photography so that I nearly did not buy this one. That would have been a great mistake. I received my money's worth in the first 50 pages and the rest is a bonus.He know photographers and digital photography - but the big suprise is his unboring frivolous style. It is by far the best value book I have seen on this complex topic.
3,"Good, but very basic","When I bought this I did it mainly because of the title, ""..for digital photographers"".After I read about Bridge, cropping and resizing, I was almost halfway through the book. Of course those things are useful, maybe I missunderstood and thought it was a book about levels, saturation, and learning how to manipulate color. I didn't learn much about layering techniques or things I was looking for as a photographer.It's a good book if you're not familiar with the most basic concepts, I'd recommend it. But if you're a photographer looking for more advanced photo manipulation, you'll get only a 3 star book. It has 3 or 4 very good tricks, but nothing you can't find on the web with a little surfing."
5,A Must Have!,"Some books are good, others aren't. Some books are a necessity... this is one of those.Seriously, if you do Photoshop CS2 and digital photography, you need this book. Its step-by-step procedures are perfectly laid out to help you achieve that priceless photo you have been looking for. Most of us are less than perfect at photography, and this book will help make it look like you are!Not only is it written in an easy to follow format, but its very humorous and easily read (MAKE SURE YOU READ THE FORWARD AND INTRODUCTION!!).This book is most assuredly a necessity!"
5,The Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital Photographers - the must have book for digital imagery,"This is an excellent resource by Scott Kelby. It walks one through the old and new of Photoshop CS2, explaining the advances to longstanding tried and true favorites of Photoshop and the newest developments that are sure to please and excite the hearts of Photoshop loyalists. A must have for every digital photographer!"
5,"GREAT SERVICE, but ordered the wrong book.","The book arrived in a timely manner and in good condition, but I made the mistake of ordering the wrong book. I am interested in info for CS4, not the one I ordered. I have passed it on to the local library.Will try again soon."
4,A good book for newcomers to Photoshop,"I must admit I didn't appreciate Scott's humour, and basing his chapter titles on movies, songs and band names was very unhelpful; I'd heard of very few of them. In the past I've loved the humour in these ""how to"" computer books, but it needs to come naturally rather than be forced as it is here. And there IS far too much of it (though perhaps I might feel differently it actually made me laugh or chuckle). That said, I've found some pretty useful stuff in this book and I have to commend Scott for assuming his readers might be beginners to Photoshop and therefore need every step explaining. But one book never covers everything you can learn about a program. I find I need to try at least two, preferably three. So my next one will be that by Martin Evening."
3,Not for Advanced Photographers,"Although there are solid pieces of information here, this book is more geared for someone at intermediate stages of Photoshop. I strongly agree with other posts who do not appreciate the pages full of unecessary attempts at humor. Mr. Kelby knows his Photoshop, but the reader has to dig through too much filler to get to any solid learning.Good for beginners."
5,very useful book,"this book got me started doing lots of very cool things on CS2. the userinterface on photoshop is NOT userfriendly by any means for the novice. The terminology and the menus hide lots of powerful features. Until they do a major UI overhaul, this book by kelby is a good starting guide."
5,This is the 3rd time I've bought this book ...,"Yes, I bought the book when it was for version 7, then when it was for CS and now for the CS2 version. It gets better each time. But I suppose that's a given, because Photoshop has gotten better each time. The first two had a neat black/gray/white calibration target in the back, so this one goes one better with a black/gray 18%/gray 13%/white card. There are lots of new tips and features and twists on things you can do. One of the really neat new additions is the ability to find the neutral tone of your photograph is a semi-automatic way. So now you can find the black, gray and white point for use in Curves. There's lot's more and many goodies, but you can read all about them in the main publisher's description as well as other reveiws. This is definitely a great book that will make it easy for you to be a Photoshop master with your digital photos."
4,"Good book, rediculous intros","I really like this book, but like a lot of people do not have any excess time to waste. It contains great tips and techniques, but frankly he should have left out the introductions or used them to, well, introduce the chapter. It might give him some sort of release to write things that have nothing to do with the topic, but for me it is a waste of time. Buy it for the tips, skip the intros."
2,"Don't expect to understand, just to follow key strokes","I was very disappointed. The book fails to explain the concepts of key areas like layers, and just gives the sequence of keystrokes to get something done (it is very hard in Photoshop, to extrapolate from sequence of keystrokes to understanding ""complex"" functionality). For some simple things is fine, but to empower you to further explore Photoshop is not enough. If you really want to understand Photoshop go somewhere else (I've bought a couple of more book to give them a try). By the way, don't expect anything fomr the Adobe users manual, it is a disaster."
5,simple instructions + great CS2 book,"This was an great book. There were many things I didn't know how to but easily learned after reading the book step by step. A professor suggested I purchase the book, and it was a great purchase. I don't think it's for absolute beginners, but if you have some experience with Photoshop and want to do more advanced things this is an excellent book."
3,A Comedian You're Not,"The book could be better if Kelby would do a better job explaining the reasons behind doing certain adjustments. If nothing else, a simple improvement would be to get rid of the interjections of bad humour. Whoever gave Kelby the idea he was funny anyways. Scott, I really don't care about how you arrived at naming a chapter. Your attempts at being funny are annoying at best."
1,Not so good,"First off, so much of the copy is devoted to his horrible sense of humor, imagine a junior high school student ""acting big"" to impress his friends with jokes, that type of annoying bravura humor is simply unrelenting throughout the book. It is filler. The illustrations are sized so big the actual technical content of the book is quite low. Just more filler. Finally, all the techniques in the book can be found during normal operation of PS, or at worst a few internet searches. I think this book is over-priced and I wish I could return it. Caveat emptor!"
2,The Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital Photographers,I guess the author wrote for Dummies. His sense of humor is very annoying. The author does not stick to the facts. He makes you read his long winded stories and antidotes about the authors adventures in a shopping mall and with his friends. If I wanted to be entertained I would watch Joe Leno.
3,Your Camera Must Support RAW Mode,"I like how the author gets right down to ""how to"" do the different Photoshop editing tasks as opposed to just describing them. That's the good part. The bad is that it most of the book talks about editing photos in the ""RAW"" mode, a feature only supported by higher end cameras. The book is pretty much useless otherwise. Also, the author could really tone down the humor, a little is OK, but too much makes me feel like it's trying to make up for lack of content or something. I returned the book and finally bought ""Adobe Photoshop CS2 one-on-one by Deke McClelland""...I'm only on Ch.4 of that one but have been very impressed so far (will write review for that item when finished)."
1,Do Not Recommend,"This is one of the most user-unnfriendly books I have ever used. The writer sometimes mixes up instructions on Mac versus on PC and that throws you off at every point. Also he is constantly assuming certain windows are already open for you or certain functions have already been activated. So he'll go ""Press V"" and ""Press D"" but nothing happens although apparently it was suppossed to make your background white (what does that even means!). So I am not recommending this book to anyone at all."
3,Not yet used enough,"This book holds a wealth of information. It's not an easy read and it takes awhile to really understand all the capabilities of the Photoshop professional software...much less to be able to do it. We are not professionals but really appreciate and like to work on photography, so I just figure it will take us a bit longer than some others to really benefit from the wisdom the book contains."
5,Everything you need,I just received this book- my first by the author. I've taken a class on Photoshop and I think this book was much more helpful. All the tips you're looking for- steps I couldn't figure out on my own without a lot of headache. The author neatly and succinctly lays out just about all you need to know. I'm impressed.
4,great for beginners of digital photography,This book was a great help as I was learning the digital editing process and getting my workflow together. I would recommend this book to anyone new to the field or already in it and wants to learn some new editing methods. The author's humor is hilarious. It actually helped me to get through the chapters.
5,fabulous book,"This is my second Scott Kelby book. I love the way he writes and illustrates his books. His sense of humour is funny, but a bit much at times...all in all though, I have recommened his books to many people who are struggling with photoshop or CS2. It has taken me from having some understanding and limited capabilities of the program to a whole new level. I would recommend it for novice to intermediate photoshop users for sure."
3,Good reference for common tasks,"Good book for a reference for workflows in Photoshop CS2 for various tasks... But that's pretty much what it's good for... It's really just a book that teaches you step-by-step how to do something rather than teaching what the button's you're pushing actually do.On the flip side, it's a great book for beginners that can now see what Photoshop is capable of and will then get the chance to decide whether they want to invest more time into reading another book that provides more depth into the application."
3,Not what I had expected,"I wouldn't say this is a bad book, (which would be overruled by all the other reviews anyway), but if I had had the chance to browse through it in a bookstore I would not have bought it.There is too much stuff in the book that I already knew, or is too obvious, or that I'm just not interested in.There is no question that the author knows what he is talking about and I'm sure that given a specific task he would do a far better job then me. And I found a couple of really interesting and and useful techniques. But there's just too much in the book that doesn't appeal to me. (How to use the red eye removal tool, how to create an infrared picture that is not an infrared picture in the end etc)So it might just be the book for you, it just wasn't for me."
3,Same o' Same o',"Im all for scott kelby's books but this is geting rediculous. I have been a scott kelby's fan for a while now and every book he wrote i bought.I actually read every page and bookmarked all the good effects thats why i can tell you this with a straight face, if you previously own a photoshop book for digital photographer written by Mr. Kelby then please, do your self a favor by not wasting your money on this one. He just use the SAME EXACT techniques from his previous books, slap on new pictures add maybe 3 new tricks that are not so impressive.The new tricks he include in here are mostly how to make your image look like a frame... wich translate to adding a black background under your image THATS THE ONLY NEW THING. This book is good for those who havent seen a book by scott kelby before thats the only i gave it 3 stars... it should really be 0 star i am trully disapointed in scott kelby for practically stealing 30 bucks from me and sorry to say he just lost a loyal fan"
5,"finally, i dont feel stupid in photoshop","wow, this book is great! it shows you, step by step, how to do things in photoshop that are actually useful. i've tried to learn photoshop many times over (many versions over, too) but i felt that i just didn't understand how the program works. all the books i've picked up go into explaining each tool, menu, and feature of photoshop in such a way that bores the reader before ever getting to use them! with mr. kelby's book, he teaches you right from the start (well, not exactly the start but maybe about pg.2) how to do useful things. I've already dog-ear'ed my copy in several places, and i'm not even through reading it! after practicing on my own photos, I feel a lot more confident in navigating photoshop and can honestly say I understand a TON more than I did before. well worth it's weight in gold. if you're into digital photography, get this book.i would also recommend mr. kelby's newest book, ""the digital photography book"" too."
3,Good formulaic information,"A lot of info here, but in the end largely formulaic. Still it is very readable and there are a few pearls."
5,Best Workbood for Novices,Im a novice digital photographer who was having difficulty with Photoshop CS2 software but with Scott Kelby's simple and easy user friendly approach I have been able to produce true art work. I recommend this book to all especially those that are having problems with figuring out the software.
5,A must have.........,Excellent and very easy book to understand. Scott Kelby goes right to the point so you you know at once how to proceed with the program. I have ordered the CS3 version.
3,"If you own the 1st CS book, you don't need CS2","I love all of Kelby's books, so I was very excited to read the latest for CS2. It is another great book if you don't already own some of his previous PS books. However, I found myself going over a bunch of tips and tricks that have been around in his past work. There are a few great things in the book, but I don't feel it justifies the purchase."
4,Great intro to Photoshop for Digital Photos,"His writing style may be a little cutesy, but most of that is concentrated in the chapter intros which you can safely skip - there's absolutely nothing about photo editing in the chapter intros. They don't even introduce the chapter.The book is organized into different sections, each one covering a topic of interest to those working with digital photos (e.g. sharpening, color correction, etc). The images that are used for the step by step examples in the book are available (URL provided in the book - Introduction, Page xvii) so that you can try the exact same steps, with the exact same parameters, on the exact same image, and judge for yourself how they turn out.As another reviewer pointed out, a grey card for white balancing your photo is included, together with instructions on how to use it. Overall, a useful book if you're a Photoshop beginner."
3,Somewhat lacking in detail,This book comes highly recommended but for myself its a tad disappointing. Kinda breezes through the how to sections often without providing enough detail. I too like the reviewer below didn't care for Scott's attempts at being humorous but that doesn't take way form his knowledge about Photoshop.Very unhappy with amazons recent attempts with shipping also. Book should have been wrapped to avoid sliding in box as cover is slightly damaged but not worth the hassle of returning. Payed for the Standard Shipping and it didn't arrive on time.
3,Misplaced comedian,"Kelby is undoubtedly knowledgeable, but I find (in this book and the previous ones) his attempts to be a comedian rather than an expert increditbly irritating. He's good at Photoshop. He's decidedly unfunny when he tries to be.This book is useful if one of the very specific issues or problems Kelby describes is the problem you are facing. But this is seldom the case. As a comprehensive overview of the latest incarnation of Photoshop, you can do a lot better than Kelby."
1,Not for me thanks!,"I found this to be one of the most irritating texts I have ever read. I really do not want to know about your lovely wife and family Scott, I have one of my own; I want the facts, clearly laid out, free of poor attempts at witticism. The book was so annoying that I could barely pick it up and now I have given it away to annoy someone else. The author is clearly an expert but should stick to the facts please- I'm a Brit!"
4,Boxwave mini capacitive Iphone 4 Stylus,"This little stylus is worth buying, specially if you find it hard to use your finger on the glass screen.Verry easy to use in the winter time when wearing gloves.The pin keeps it near the Iphone ready for use when needed.It works!"
4,Fast and great quality.,"Very fast color draft print mode, rated at 14 ppm. I'm seeing 11 seconds on first page out in full page color draft. The color draft mode is very good, quite acceptable for reports and newletters. Has a large 10.5"" print area on 11"" paper (0.04"" top margin and 0.46"" bottom margin). Holds lots of supplies so you don't have to swap them often. Seperate ink tanks saves money on ink - full color draft letter size paper came to 9 cents per copy by our testing - including paper and depreciation. Only has a Parallel port standard, could have used USB too."
1,Unimpressive capacity.,"The capacity of this machine is so unimpressive that it leaves you wondering who they had in mind when they called it a business jet. The number of pages in the tray is minute, but the amount printing that can be done with the mini ink cartridges is underwhelming. You then realise the cost involved with replacing them, not long thereafter comes the whopping cost of replacing the print heads. HP shareholders may rest assured that customers are forced to come back for more and more and more. But will they ever want to buy another HP printer. Both thumbs firmly down."
5,Funny All The Way!,"This is really and truly a very, very funny book! The title itself tells you it's going to be funny, and you won't be disappointed. Jeff, the first-person teller of the tale is clever and amusing himself. The name he bestows upon his nosy next-door neighbor is a case in point - Bat Ears. But, of course, the star of the book is chubby, lovable Eugene Aloysius Pierre Phillippe Carondelet. ""But mais ouis!"" as he would say, smiling sweetly. All I can say is who would have ever thought you could have warm fuzzy feelings about a vampire? Well, just read the book. You'll see!"
2,Disappointed with Alabama Love Story,"I usually love anything to do with Alabama; however, this was definitely a ""B"" rated movie. The acting was not very good and the story line was so-so. I'm sure I won't be watching it again, I'll be trying to give it away."
4,Where can I find the songs?,"Let me say that I like this movie very much. While it is far fetched, it still has a wonderful charm to it. It would particularly help if you are a Mark Collie or Coley McCabe fan, (I love Mark Collie, he is such an under appreciated talent ) however, it is not a requirement. If you go for sweet simple romance, you will enjoy this movie. That being said...Does anyone have any idea where a sound track or the songs from the movie can be found!? The songs are absolutely wonderful and add a great deal to the movie. I would love to have complete versions of them and can't find them anywhere. I know that most of the songs were written jointly by Collie and Coley who were at one time married. I just can't understand why such great songs are not on some CD somewhere. If anyone has any information, please let me know.Thanks."
1,Review,Wanted to return it because I ordered the wrong item but wouldn't let me. Would have liked them to send a alternative but didn't offer.
5,The dancer becomes an actress.,She proves that she can act when given the chance!! The last scene with her in is just delightful. She had a director who let her perform.
4,Better than most soaps,"The story isn't much, but the performances and direction make it well worth watching. And Stanwyck for a change plays an almost timid gal. Gardner is at her slutty best with a very meaty part as the other woman, Isabel. And my favorite role is Sondergard's, masterfully portraying Stanwyck's mother. Mason's part is pretty weak. You wonder why any woman would want him........in fact, as Stanwyck says at the end......Isabel used to be between us....but now she's dead and now there's nothing between us."
1,How to start and produce a magazine or newsletter,"Nothing against the British, but this book is very British and very hard to follow. The information given is not relayed to the reader in any kind of semblance of order. I'm really not sure if this guy ever produced a magazine or newspaper because he doesn't go into much detail about things you should know. It's a bunch of fluff. Don't buy this one."
2,"""Can't Judge a Book By It's Cover""","The cover to this magazine definitely makes it look fun and informative - both preceptions are wrong! It gives you the ordinary, obvious information that any person already knows. I recomend you purchasing another book, which I am sure has the same exact information PLUS more!"
1,the accidental life of the world's first supermodel,"The book should be titled ""The Accidental Worst Book Ever Writen."" How pathetic and depressing to read about an over-the-hill model! Don't waste your time or money!"
1,I DON'T NEED TO READ IT TO KNOW ITS BAD,"Janice Dickinson is arrogant, senselessly self-assured, and loud. This would be a supermodel trifecta, if it weren't for one thing: she's UNATTRACTIVE. Her face is a continuous work-in-progress for some cosmetic surgeon, yet she remains unfazed. She's so fame-starved that she has to appear on America's Next Top Model. She ""thinks"" so much that she managed to pen down some garbage like this. While this may sound like the rantings of a jealous woman, trust me -- that is not the case. I'm a disgusted man. MOVE ON, JANICE!"
4,Good read,"Sure it's not Steinbeck or anything but this is an interesting book. Janice is very full of herself and you can totally tell from reading the book but we also get to see a different side of her here, the vulnerable side, the lonely side, the heart broken side... This book makes for good summer reading."
5,Courageous memoir and fascinating life,"I loved this book. Janice Dickinson has lived a full, gutsy and sometimes tragic life on her own terms. Experiences that would have ruined others seemed to make her stronger. I think the fire raging inside of her helped her to survive her horrible abusive father but it also fueled her drug and alcohol consumption. Nothing small or underdone in this life. And the one thing that saves her is that as much as she is ambitious and bitter from people using or abusing her is the light inside her... the love that managed to survive... a love that blossomed with the birth of her children. This is a no holds barred book by a super-sized personality. Janice Dickinson is not just a supermodel. She is a very real human being with a big heart and an importnt story and message."
5,i love janice,"This book starts off pretty disturbingly.. but once you get past that, its great. Janice is honest as always, and this book is a bunch of fun to read. Iy's great to know whats behind the world first supermodel.Reccomended!"
4,entertaining,"no, Dickinson will not win a Pulitzer, but that is not the point. this book is a peek into the surreal world of fame and fortune. Dickinson wrote this book for release and i think she did a hell of a job. i don't think she wants anyone to feel sorry for her, she simply demonstates, too well, that no one is above human vice, loneliness, and change. i started this book with a closed mind, and yes her egoism in her early days can be a bit redundant, but guess what? she was young, gorgeous, filthy rich and totally clueless. at least she is honest about her shortcomings. in a world that chews people up, she has not only survived... she has shared her lessons with the rest. solid."
4,"Surprisingly biting, witty, and honest look at a super-life","This book is a delicious, honest and open romp through the life of a superstar. Dickinson is very dishy and bitchy and I can imagine this caused many waves when she told-all, but it makes for excellent reading. She revealed whirlwind top-of-the-world moments alond with the bone-crushing lows of her life, all with humor and wit.At times, the book seemed to ramble and I felt like we lost a storyline, but Janice (or her editor) always brought the story back and made her original point.I read Dickinson's other memoir, ""Everything About Me is Fake,"" before I read this one. I highly recommend reading this ""No Lifeguard"" first, because it explains how Janice was shaped as a person and the growing pains she went through to get to the top of the world. If you enjoyed this one, definitely read her follow-up, because she's in a very happy place for that book, and she's really in control of her later life."
5,Not your average memoir !! Couldn't put it down!!!,"This book was an experience to read! It was BRUTALLY honest in its language and its content. It was both a confessional and an insider view to the world of modeling. This book isn't boring for an instant! She writes not just with honesty, but with HEART! There is no b.s. about Janice! She also has a wickedly wry sense of humor. She can be acerbic and outrageous, yet very sweet and sentimental, especially when she's talking about her two children. I highly recommended this book, though I DON""T recommended it for the faint of heart or the easily offended. There are nude photos throughout and very graphic language. But she uses it to make her points, not gratuitously.If you are looking for a refreshingly different memoir, this one is in a class by itself!"
2,Leave This Book Where It Is At,"I picked up this book thinking that it was going to be a tell-all book filled with celebrity gossip. This book is more about Janice's life in the modeling world. If you are interested in modeling, then you might enjoy this book, otherwise the many modeling world details will bore you. She comes from a horrible family life. As for Janice herself, in the book she portrays herself as someone who sleeps around for no good reason, not love, not money, just useless loose sexual relations. She does dish limited info on her few affairs with well known celebs, but she doesn't give any real juicy details. She seems rather self-important and by no means would I ever consider her the world's first supermodel. Naomi, Cindy, Elle, and Tyra, are supermodels. Janice is someone that wrote a book to be remembered."
3,no lifeguard on duty,"this book is interesting when it talks about her life with family and friends but the rest of it is slow and boring i thought this was going to be great like her other book but its very boring and hard to keep reading,"
5,Great Read!,This book showed Janice being honest about her checkered past and showcased her trademark sense of humor. I enjoyed reading it and found it hard to put down. You really get a glimpse into what made her into the (crazy) person she is today and how she is trying to turn things around. Definitely worth the time to read!
3,Vanity is not a virtue,"The book was interesting, no doubt. It was hard to put it down....but, I found it quite annoying how Janice constantly put herself on a pedestel. There is nothing more annoying than someone who thinks that they are above everyone else. Yes, she was beautiful and she worked hard, but if she really wanted to make a legend of herself, she would at least PRETEND to be more humble. At many times, I felt the book was b.s. and completely fabricated. I read this book after reading the biography of ""Gia,"" and definitely have more respect for Janice based on that. I still think she is an icon and respect her for trying to be the best mother she can be. Maybe she should have more of her peers edit her writings before they get published????? You're a mommy now!Regardless, she's made her mark in American history!!!"
1,The World's First What?,"With a second book coming out called ""Everything About Me Is Fake, etc..."", I think I may just need a refresher on the true stat of Ms. Dickenson in the modeling industry. Not the first supermodel and certainly not the most interesting. I believe it was the mighty Lauren Hutton and Karen Graham who hold the title of the first and greatest. Even Twiggy and Jean ""the Shrimp"" Shrimpton, Veruska- so many others who left their mark on the history of the business. As a fashion editor for twenty five years now, I can guarantee that Ms. Dickenson was far from ""super""- more like ""super not dependable"". This book was fun if you are into fiction but if you really want the truth, I suggest reading ""Model"" by Michael Gross."
1,Maybe the world's first trashy model-but NO WAY super!,"This book is a super waste of time and money. Some intelligent reviewers have already said it all. The reviewer ""globetrotter"" on August 29, 2002 wrote the best review of all. There's not much I can add to it except that I have seen Ms. Dickinson on several talk shows prior to her book and after its publication. She comes across as low class, abrasive, and disrespectful, and does nothing to deserve our sympathy. It was sickening how many times (in her book) she claims to have coined the word ""supermodel"" and claims to have been the world's first! Don't waste your money on this one. It deserves zero stars."
4,good book,"I really enjoyed this book. It is like a guilty pleasure. She bugs you to a point cause she is really something else I cant explain it. She is obnoixous, loud, makes dumb decisions, etc but you cant help but love her. I read the book in like 2 days. She really did have a interesting life. The sylvester stallone thing bothered me. I can see why he left her. Not right! But this book was good and if you are into hollywood gossip and that sort of stuff you will like it....I will be buying her other book. I am sure it will be great"
1,Interesting story ruined by language,"""No Lifeguard On Duty"" is a remarkable memoir written in four-letter words, or more accurately one four-letter word. I slogged my way thru the muck and almost finished the story but wish I'd saved my money. Instead of recycling the book, as I do with most books, I trashed it."
1,"Can I Rate it ""No Stars""?","I decided to read up on this Ms. Dickinson after catching her on a episode of ""America's Next Top Supermodel"" where she is a judge. I found her to be somewhat abrasive and now I know why. She should not be allowed to advise anyone on anythng. Her life as a sex addict and alcoholic as well as her unwillingness to accept people as they are is annoying not only on TV, but in her book. She comes across extremely shallow and is likely one of the reasons that young girls purge themselves given the fact that Ms. Dickinson constantly refers to the average woman as ""huge"". My advice to anyone seeking the advice of a mentor in a supermodel should stay clear away from this one. She likely spends much of her past earnings on a psychiatrist couch crying about her new and many wrinkles."
1,An Accidental Book,"After reading the first 15 pages of the book, I was appalled at the numerous amounts of 4-letter words she used. A few 4-letter words are okay to make a point. But Janice couldn't write a book without using every other word as a 4-letter word starting with F and S. I am no saint, but there was too much profanity and not enough of her life as a model. She also put down other models, and called them ""mutts"", claiming she was the worlds first supermodel. I grew up with Janice and Gia and a few others, and I can tell you she was not the first supermodel. This book was written only to promote her upcoming TV show that airs in June of 2006. Janice needs to clean up most of her potty mouth and admit she has an inferiority complex that is in dire need of mending."
3,Interesting Reading,"The author, Janice Dickinson puts an interesting spin on being one of ""the beautiful people"". She has a horrible upbringing and came out of it better than most. The parts of the book that I most enjoyed of course were her contributions to pop culture. Janice tells of coining the phrase ""supermodel"" and when she told Calvin Klein he shoud design underwear and put his name on it...I read this book in two days and on the book jacket Lauren Hutton (one of Janice's idols) says she read it in one sitting."
3,"Janice, ya gotta love her","I bought this book for two reasons...1. I needed something to read while I waited to pick my kids up from school and 2. Because I remember Janice Dickinson on the covers of magazines when I was a teenager. I didn't expect much just something to pass the time. However, it was quite engaging and while some might have wanted dirt on other celebrites, Janice remained a class act just telling HER story and no one elses. I found myself just wanting to give her a hug (I'm a woman and a mother) you couldn't help but wanting to do that after reading what she endured in her youth. But Janice is a fighter and the kind of girl you could hangout with and have a few laughs. She's honest and her honesty is what makes her likable. You can't help but root for a happy ending for this woman!"
3,Buttons are not programmable,The mouse seemed to work but the buttons are not programmable. Microsoft's version of this mouse (the wireless laser mouse 8000) has all of the features I needed so I ended up returning this one.
5,"One great cd to buy. Fresh, simple, and excellent lyrics...",My boyfriend and i never heard of them until we went to a concert of theirs. We bought their cd on a whim at the concert even before they went on. We are great fans of theirs now. Their music is simple but not plain. Lyrics are to the point and express a feeling anyone has had in life. It's good to see a local band come so far in such a big world as the music industry...Buy the cd! You will be pleasanly surprized.
4,Great unknown band,"You just need one listen to Flat Tire to get hooked. With few exceptions, this CD is full of catchy soft rock songs (sometimes ressembling country). Some of these songs may grow old a little quick (So long, Different Situation), but there's a good chance you'll never get tired of the better ones like Flat Tire or the energetic Unnoticed.The only thing really that you can hold against Athenaeum is that some of their songs really sound alike. Some of the ballads on this album sound just the same. But it's really a minor detail because they may be similar, but they're still worth listening to (something they are missing on their other albums). If you have to buy only one Athenaeum CD (and you should) it would be this one."
5,this cd is a rare accomplishment,"""Radiance"" is just an incredible cd with interesting (and by that I mean NOT repetitive) melodies and memorable lyrics that stay with you long after the song has ended. ""What I Didn't Know,"" is pure radio-friendly music, and it amazes me that absolutely none of the stations in my area picked up on it. But this is by far not the best song on the cd; my personal favorites are ""Away,"" ""Flat Tire,"" and ""No One Feels,"" all of which I'm able to relate to on a personal level, a very good sign for any song. This cd is well worth it, being at least ten times better than anything on the Top 40."
2,"one great tune, the rest mediocre","Based on the reviews given on this site, and on the great first track, I bought the CD. I was very disappointed - the rest of the songs are second-tier, and of a different style (much more laid back). Buy the first track as a single instead."
5,Not gonna lie.....,"I'm a sucker for for 90's college coffee house rock bands, and this CD definitly ranks up there with the best of them. What's interesting is that I cannot reallly compare this band to anyone else, maybe a softer Eve 6 but I doubt that is even approprite. Athenaeum is simply a good rock band. Pick the CD up and you will understand what I'm talking about."
5,A Peeerless Pop Album,"Song for song, this is better than matchbox 20, Savage Garden, Third Eye Blind or the other lightweights getting attention. They're also superior in concert to all of the above. Borrow a copy from someone, and I promise you'll wanna buy your own copy from Amaazon.com to support a great band (and to have the record for yourself)."
5,Not A Weak Cut On This Killer CD,"Every blessed track on this album is superb, and it's also far more atmospheric soundtrack music than most of the dross used in contemporary cinema. The band deserves better videos, and this record is a great, rousing & touching pop-rock trip that everybody should take."
4,Not bad,"The velcro peices that adhere to your dash dont stick unless the dash is cleaned with gusto prior to instillation. But once that is done this mat serves its perpouse well. Slightly ill fitting it likes to bunch up in corners where its mot perfectly taylored but it keeps my dash from cracking an keep my lude clean! Overall yes i would recomend this to someone, after all you dont wanna look bad in ten years at a cracked and faded dash and say "" i should have gotten that cover"". Also make a great place to hold iten with velcro on bottoms, ie i pods, phones, gps, even radar detectors (providing they're legal in your state)."
4,Very Cool Jams!,I am thrilled with Ohn's CD. The music is great for when I want to be in a new-age relaxed state. It is perfect for a party or a drive through the city. These guys have a terrific sound and I look forward to collecting all of their CDs!!!!They definately got it ohn!!!!
2,"Capable but Dry, Rehash of ""Revising Prose""","Unless your are a professional teacher of technical prose analysis, I'd stay clear of this book. I got it because I loved and still use regularly, Revising Prose. I thought rather than get the more recent edition of the Revising Prose, I'd try this more scholarly Analyzing Prose. Half a mistake; I regifted the book to my sister-in-law who works in the profession, for whom this is probably a good book to have around or at least it justifies having it. But for the (even professional) more general writer/editor, stick to Revising Prose."
5,Another winner,"Again, this guy has the right idea, but no one pays attention and he is having seemingly zero affect on the verbose language which is academia."
3,Great tool for close analysis!,A must have for any college level english course; great guide for effective close readings.
1,The worst product ever...,"I bought this product before reading the reviews about it. I was looking for the Zalman one, which was about $50.00 and after adding it to my wish list the Thermaltake was suggested with a price of $37.00, much cheaper than the Zalman's one. I should had sticked with the first one. The Thermaltake Hardcano worked for about 15 minutes. Channel 2 (connect to my VGA card) was the first one to stop. Changed to channel 3 and 30 minutes later the channel 1 (on my CPU cooler) stop working, overheated and the PC shut down. I took it out, put my older reostat controller and gave up on this controller. Now I am waiting to receive my Zalman ZM-MFC2 Multi Fan Controller, bought few days ago.Conclusion: Don't waste your money on this Thermaltake Hardcano, it is garbage!"
1,"Poor support, parts included don't support most fans","The product only includes one 4 pin to 3 pin converter, so this means that all of your fans are controlled in unison unless you purchase 3 more adapters, but I can't find the exact adapter and the people at Thermaltake offered to find it for me and sent me the wrong part in a link. I sent them the picture of their part and told them to match it...no response. This product would be fine if all your fans are 3 pin. Their support person I talked to was rude and hauty. Don't buy this product unless you have the correct fans. The irony is that I purchased my fans directly from Thermaltake."
2,HARDCANO 12,NOT RECOMENDEDProsExceptionally sharp looking.Blue backlit LCD display makes reeding easy.Very useful deviceConsLimited alarm presets. STOP WORKING AFTER FEW DAYSQuestionable fit on some cases if mounted in top most bay of a case with a bezel door.
5,Cf Amanda Cross and John Irving,"Steve Rudd's medical/academic mystery fills the void left by Kate Fansler's exit and gives readers a savvy new profiler, Chris Van Zant. Like Irving's A Widow for One Year, Midnight Red may teach the reader more than he/she wants to know. The mind-stretch is worth the risk."
2,not impressed,"I use to swear by this litter and now i wouldn't recommend it to my grandma. They must have changed the litter, the litter does not clump. The urine breaks apart before you even remove it from the litter box. I would recommend picking another brand."
5,Other litters are simply no match.,"The most incredible cat litter ever. All other cat litters allow you to easily scoop fecal matter out while at the same time allowing pee-ridden little to go right back into the box (quickly trickles from the litter scoop). You end up with soiled litter right back in the box. Tidy Cats litter creates ""pee balls"" (peed-on litter gets absorbed 100% by the litter so that it's able to be scooped up entirely by a litter scoop). Additionally, ALL odor is instantly diminished with this litter. All other litters mask odor until the cat or a cat scoop stirs it up.I made a studip choice and chose very similiar litter one time just because it was cheaper. I paid the price...literally and figuratively. I could smell cat pee instantly after the cat used the box. I ended up selling the rest of the litter at a yard sale.Tidy Cats = A+."
1,Not A Great Litter Choice,"I grew disenchanted with Tidy Cat after 4 years of use. The clumps fell apart leaving lots of urine soaked gravely bits that were too small to scoop. I'm a daily scooper and my cat's box smelled horribly after only a few days of putting all fresh litter in. I tried Scoop Away Unscented and am in love with it. It clumps tightly and absorbs all of the odors even though it's unscented. My cat had no trouble adjusting to it, and she's really finicky about her litter. I highly recommend Scoop Away Unscented vs Tidy Cat!"
4,"Great, Straight Cardio","This video has three progressive cardio workouts. The goal is to do the first workout a few times a week, and then build up to adding the second and the third. The first workout is not difficult, but is based on dance steps, so it keeps you focused. If you do not have a lot of cardio endurance, start with the first one, you will be amazed how fast you can progress if you stick with it. If you already have good cardio endurance, jump right in and do all three. It's a great, simple cardio workout with no equipment, but interesting enough to keep you moving!"
1,can i rate it ZERO STARS???,i believe it was deceiving too. i was hoping for some pilates integrated with dance when the video stated it was a dance workout. i only got through ten minutes of it before shutting the video off! i thought the music was cheesy and it wasn't much of a workout either. i'm sticking with jennifer kries....
4,Easy to follow video for beginners,"The video is broken up into short segments. You need to do all of the segments in order to work out long enough to burn fat. If you are a real beginner, you could do the first segment three times for a long enough work out, but that could get boring.This is a good basic cardio workout."
2,"This provides no positive effects, it is just too easy!","This video, though promising to build up your cardio system, is too easy for even beginners. I would, however, recommend it for elder people who are looking to just move around in a safe way. The difference between each level is very minimal, too. If you want to boost your cardio system, don't buy this!"

1,BEWARE!,Not compatible with the ipod classic. I called Altec Lansing and they confirmed this fact. Unfortunately it is not mentioned in any of the instructions or materials. Very disappointed. To return it I pay a 20% restocking fee.
2,Disappointing,"It looked like a bargain, and it was compatible with our iPods. It was easy to install, and the size of the speaker units was impressive! But I'm afraid the sound wasn't - far too much base, and not enough treble, and not enough options to adjust the sound levels properly. Perhaps it's fine if you're just looking to use it for videos, but it's not worth relying on for the music reproduction quality. Often the lyrics are simply drowned out. Going to have to buy something else - this just doesn't cut it for us."
5,Great Product,"Great sound quality for such a small speaker system. Worth every cent. We thoroughly enjoy using it. I just wish the screen was bigger for video, but the sound is so good, that I would definitely trust any new generation with a larger screen. Definitely a good buy."
3,Good Science Report,This is a book you will read once unless you are in business of survival techniques. It has few emotional components to keep you coming back. Worth the read for sure but not a literary classic.
3,"Beautiful women, but to my way of thinking, somewhat plodding","Truthfully, the main reason I keep _The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova_ in my DVD library (actually, I re-added it this spring after having sold it off last year) is because of all the Euro-beauties who doff their clothes in this film - Britt Ekland, Marisa Berenson, Sylva Koscina, et al. If it weren't for them, I'd frankly find this film rather dull. As it is, it's more plodding than a movie about Casanova's life ought to be. But just when I get bored, a new beauty falls into Casanova's life and bed and out of her clothes, so I keep watching. And so it goes..."
2,The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova (AKA Casanova & Co.),"Amusing film, not as funny as when I first saw it some 20yrs ago. Very poor lip synchronisation."
3,Does the job but isn't amazing,"You get what you pay for here. I am a cheap college student, and I pay for a cheap calculator. It works wonderfully, but the only thing that is inconvenient for me is the memory this little thing has. If I want to look back to the last equation I put in, it doesn't remember it, unlike new calculators. But, hey, I am totally satisfied because I only needed it for one semester. It does a lot more than my little casio calculator too. To my knowledge it has the functions as a newer one that typical people might use(of course there are sweet programs from the new ones, but most don't use those functions anyway). It works well, especially for the price I paid. :)"
4,Number Cruncher,"Obviously it is way outclassed for advanced mathematics. But if you find a TI-81 in good condition, you won't find a better number cruncher friend. The keys are very tactile, solid and responsive, and the results come up fast. I got my TI-81 in 1992, and 19 years later, I still have it, and sans a few cosmetic quirks that come of aging, it still feels and works like new."
3,Oldy but goody,"Picked this up for my kid that needed a graphing function calculator, this one was more than adequate for her college course. She isn't going into math or engineering so this does what she needs at a great price. Picked up from an Amazon reseller used."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this mainly as a collector's item because it was TI's first graphing calculator. The screen is a little dimmer than I am comfortable with and it doesn't possess many of the functions more modern TIGCs. However, keep in mind it costs around $130 less than its counterparts. Overall I am happy with this calculator."
3,Repeative!,"This is Browne's fourth self-help/advice/humor book for women. This one (like most others) deals with men. Browne tells you the five men that you must have in your life (things she's touched on previously), more crap about the Promise (this just doesn't die), stuff on why your interested date doesn't seemed too interested in you and how to get him back. Really it's all stuff she's talked about before in the three previous books she's written. That doesn't mean this book was humorous. It was just repetitive after reading her other books."
3,Entertaining.....,"It was like hearing too much about a good movie, then you go, and you are disappointed. The books ARE entertaining, don't get me wrong, but every review I read said how HILARIOUS the books were, how people had tears streaming down their faces while reading etc..... Ok, YES, I found myself chuckling in public, which I rarely do when reading, I gave the first book to a friend to enjoy and I have actually USED THE PROMISE concept from the book. (Which to my surprise - because I wasn't serious AT ALL about it - WORKED!) The books are very light reading - you'll blow through an entire one on a long flight. Jill writes about so many random things she has experienced as a wife, ex-wife, friend, sister, mother...... you are bound to connect with several of her pitfalls and relate to her comments about these things that no one ever actually SAYS. I recommend reading these books, but don't have high expectations, they are easy to read and entertaining. THATS ALL. Enjoy."
3,"Funny, but a little scattered","This was an entertaining book for sure, but I found that the book would change directions out of nowhere. I'm a true-blue Southern bred Sweet Potato Queen myself, so I understand how we Belles can ramble off a million different directions without so much as a moment's notice. That said, I wish the book had a little more continuity and relevance to topic. My hat's off to Jill though for this very funny but somewhat disjointed read, bless her heart."
2,Generally disappointing.,"Even as a Northerner born & bred, I thoroughly enjoyed all of the Sweet Potato Queens books until this one. There was a bit too much reference to previous volumes which left one with that sad, retrospective, rehashed feeling rather than the fresh, comic observations of Ms. Browne's other works. Generally disappointing."
1,cliched with few chuckles.,"Maybe it's because I'm a Yankee, or maybe because the closest I get to makeup is that fake blood on Halloween, or maybe because the only bacon I'd ever eat is made of tofu, but this book was so not for me. Chick lit (marked with clichéd Southern middle aged humor) dissecting male and female relations. There were a couple of parts where I chuckled and a couple of interesting anecdotes and some good advice (like, don't stay with a guy that makes you miserable, duh), but otherwise, the humor mostly fell flat and derivative and I often found myself both embarrassed to be reading the book (particularly it's unflattering and offensive male chauvinism and its utter shallowness about beauty) and even embarrassed to be a member of my sex. Both of which maybe could have been forgiven if it had been original or funny. Ruined a good beach read. Grade: D-"
1,Little Too Late,"Thank you ""Reesie"" for your posting about the skinnycami--I googled it to find a great shaper! Too Late though, I'd already wasted my money on the Spanx Cami. Don't like the Spanx Cami.I really like the skinnycami alot beter. And the lady was soo very nice and fun. I'm going to order a black skinnycami too. Her site is [...]"
2,Light reading,"The book is OK. No great literature here, it's borders in a soap opera like story. However, it provides a interesting insight into the the catholic culture in Latin America- The devotion to saints is a wide-spread belief in the south.A-"
4,Me gusto !,"Que libro !... Me lo leí de una sentada, me encanto tanto... aunque francamente el final pudo ser menos novelesco y repetido. Sin embargo me encanta la forma en que Esperanza sigue su busqueda y su lucha, aunque parezca tan descabellada para el resto. Yo hubiera omitido al Angel, no se necesita, es un libro que profundiza sobre el amor y la fe, la lucha y la constancia, no necesita más..."
5,Easy-read for intermediate-level Spanish student,"A delightful story written in a very straight-forward grammar style. Anyone who has studied Spanish through the subjunctive tenses can read and enjoy this book, and build vocabulary at the same time."
3,"Historia Bonita, Fin Decepcionante","Antes de que empieza la historia, la hija de la protagonista se muere en la hospital. El doctor le dice a la madre, Esperanza, que su hija murió de una enfermedad muy contagiosa, y que por eso no puede ver al cuerpo. Poco después, el imagen del santo Judas Tadeo se le aparece en la ventanilla del horno y le dice que su hija no está muerta. Esperanza sale en busca de su hija, pasando por los prostíbulos de Tijuana y los Estados Unidos. La autora escribe de manera bonita y interesante, pero el fin de la novela me defraudó porque me pareció que todo el dolor y esfuerzo de Esperanza fue para nada. Al otro lado, creo que si entiende que el fin de la novela no es la mejor parte, le gustaría este libro."
1,Don't go out and buy it!,This is a waste of money. It worked yes but you may as well use it for heavy breathing pranks cause every time I tried to talk I had to take my face away from it it or I would sound like Darth Vader. The ringer on high or even normal setting is loud and would be okay if you are deaf or hard of hearing which you will be sooner or later after you have used it for awhile. All in all pointless to even buy.
5,GREAT CHAIR,"This is a comfortable chair. Well made, easy one step to put together. I'm using it at a bar height work station. This company shipped fast, 2 days. Don't be deceived about no cushion and hard surface, it is comfortable and made for a human body. Also great that the chair and foot rest move independently for different body proportions."
3,Sweet Film,"Sweet film about a pessimistic man who's eyes are opened to the pleasure in life. Matthew Broderick's great in this, the perfect choice for loveable crankiness."
4,Uplifting and wonderfully acted.,"Wonderful World stars Matthew Broderick as Ben, a one-time children's music star and now the most pessimistic person in the world. Ben holds a major grudge toward the ""man"" and his greed. Ben's character arc takes the viewer onto an entertaining ride. I rooted for Ben to get his act together throughout the entire film. His opposite and love interest was played by Sanaa Lathan as Khadi, Ibu's sister, Ben's best friend that is hospitalized. Ben learns much about how wonderful life is from the brother and sister from Senegal. The film is uplifting and pushes the idea that life is worth living and to remain strong through the difficult times. I really enjoyed the film and I definitely think it's worth the time investment to watch a great performance by Matthew Broderick."
1,A nightmarish hellscape,"In the Special Features, Broderick gives an interview that is just 3 minutes long, in which he says he made this film because a friend of his, who he's known for 20 years, wrote the script and wanted to direct it. That's pretty much all you need to know. This movie was a favor for a friend.It is massively misguided in all ways. We've got a one-note main character (that note is ""angry depression""), we've got a lot of rants against ""the man"" that aren't funny or perceptive or even weird, and we've got the main character's redemption thanks to Magic Negroes (yeah, it relies on that trope, so, yikes) who appear in his life to share their African wisdom.That said... Here's something nice: between the proofreading job, the daughter, and the guitar store, you could cut a semi-interesting short film of 10-15 minutes out of this nightmare. Too bad the writer-director thought he had a feature."
4,Good Game,"This game is great. You can get a variety of extreme weapons such as lasers, grenade launchers, flame throwers, etc. There are also many dinosaurs that you must fight such as velociraptors, tricerotops, and the well-known tyrannosaurus rex. The enviroment you play in this game is very detailed and looks real. The only thing about this game that I found bad was that it was short. I beat this game in like 2 and a half hours. But it was fun while I played it. I would recommend this game to those players that like gun shooting and dinosaur games."
2,Best left as a memory,"I first read Svens books as a teenager many years ago. Back then I thought they were ok - sufficiently so that three decades later thought I would reaquaint myself with some of the works from the series. Basically out of wanting to find a decent WWI or WWII novel from the losing sides perspective. But All Quiet on the Western Front this isnt.The purile humor, cardboard characters, predictable and despairingly shallow plot, and almost British twang that seems to flow from the narrative - remembering these are supposedly German soldiers or people aligned to the Third Reich - make for cringe worthy reading.Truly if your reading taste demands depth in plot, character development (allowing licence for the fact its one of a series), narrative, historical setting etc then you will find this a bit like the literary equivalent of eating rice by itself."
3,Men in tights: Not what I was expecting,"It is my own fault for not researching deeper. I saw the high ratings, so as a Deep Purple, Rainbow, Blackmore fan I jumped in. I had no idea he was doing this sort of thing now, which really doesn't hold much appeal to me. If you are looking for the blues based rock thing that Blackmore was know for, then look elsewhere."
4,Very good!,"Pros:Excellent show, real festive mood, good selection of songs, masterly performance.Whole extra DVD with bonus features: acoustics, videos, documentaries, etc.Fine booklet with photos and relevant info. And all this practically for the price of one DVD!Cons:Only moderate quality of video on disk 1 (some documentaries on disk 2 are shot better!).The audio tracks on disk 1 also leave much to be desired in terms of sound recording in 2004.But since some technical imperfections of the disks are more than compensated for by magnificent show itself, the verdict is: go get it!"
5,Simply amazing---Blackmore and Candice are fantastic!!!,"This is an amazingly good 2-dvd set; highly recommended. Ritchie Blackmore is my favorite guitarist and he amply rewards his millions of followers here...and Candice Night, his wife, is amazing on vocals (and to look at!). ;-) Get this asap!"
4,Almost a perfect novel!!!,"This book was a good read,I Just didnt like that louis wanted to be mortal again.But I did fall for this louis chacter,he was charming,don't get me wrong it is a good book!The story line was good,When stacy found the answer to Immortally,which louis wants her to find a way, for him to be mortal again...your just going to have to read the book to find out what happens...the end could have been mucher better to my opinion!"
1,www.ferrarofilms.net,"I am sorry but this product is way under any average production to be sold in amazon. It is a decent trip cronicle but definitively an amateur job not worth the price. The presentation is also poor, the DVD printing and the DVD cover.Camera is mostly done on hand, image very very grainy, shaky, the music too loud and not appropiate in many instances, the direct sound is bad. I did this job some years before as family videos to remember some trips but never to be sold. If no tripod available you can't make but wide shots supporting yourself on walls, stones, cars and so on.Sorry again but the truth is the only way to improve things."
1,The garbage from a garbage mind,"It's amazing that the author of this book has the gall to suggest anyone would benefit one iota from reading this tripe. Obvioulsy if you want someone to defecate on your brain pan than you have found the awful writer to do it. This is second rate work from a third rate author. Use this book to kindle a fire, or to wipe yourself when there is nothing else availible. Why anyone would publish trash like this just shows the mediocrity of the culture we live in. Obviously this woman reads Jackie Collins and jacqueline Susan and thinks if they are going to be making money writing this trash, she should as well. This ""book"" is worst than television. A snuff movie for the intellect. Try something else, anything else please. Do not be fooled by the insane writings of the author."
4,Fun Book,"An enjoyable, breezy look at the famous people in history who went broke. There are quite a few of them, and some will surprise you."
1,This book is an advertisement for the author's business,"Diet, exercise, sleep, breathing, positive mental attitude are all crucial to controlling headaches. The explanation for this ""theory"" takes up most of this book and it doesn't take an M.D. or a D.C. to figure that out. Basically, this part of the book is filler. What is said in the rest of the book would fill a pamphlet. But hey, the guy wanted to write a book about his chiropractic specialty, the Atlas vertebrae and the Atlas orthogonal procedure. There may be something to it. But I found the whole book to be simply a lead-in to the business solicitation that takes up most of the last part of the book. It explains how an out-of-town patient can fly in and recieve intensive treatment over the course of a few days, and of course, glowing testimonials. This is an advertisement masquerading as a book. Proceed at your own risk."
2,Advertisement for his clinic,"This book is an advertisement for his clinic. The information is basic, and for chronic headache sufferers will be nothing new (exercise, sleep, breathe, and have a good attitude). The last chapter is dedicated to The Atlas, the top vertebrae in your spine, which he suspects is the culprit for chronic headache sufferers. It also invites you to fly to his clinic for treatment (which is necessary because his theory apparently isn't mainstream at this point either, which means most likely a doctor in your area cannot help).Unless you are actually interested in getting treatment at his clinic and want to know what exactly he does, I wouldn't bother buying this book if you're looking for information on headaches."
3,careful with the install,"Be careful putting them in ground. Do not have the lights attached and try to push in - the lights plastic will crack. Otherwise, they are good lights, produce a white light and is better than expected for the price."
5,Duoderm CGF Control Gel Formula Dressing 4x4 inches/each,This product fully met my requirements being the same that I bought in my home country at a much higher price.
1,"Catchy music, but not practical for a serious learner","The music and format make the tape tolerable. When the woman repeats the phrase in Spanish, however, the music covers up her clear pronunciation, making it hard to hear and learn. No text of what is being said comes with the tape, so you have no idea what the words you're learning to say look like. I'm a visual and audio learner, didn't work for me. May be a nice refresher for some, but not a tape for a beginner."
4,THE RAPANESE TAPES DO CONTAIN PRINTED MATTER,"The tapes have printed matter that you can follow along if you wish. They are in the form of a nifty little ""j"" card. I never look at the printed matter. In my view the whole idea of Rapanese is that you don't need the printed matter anyway."
1,Pronunciation is awful,"I threw my tapes out after listening to them twice and being unable to believe that someone could put out a Spanish instruction tape who spoke Spanish so poorly himself. If I remember correctly, the guy who did the tapes bills himself as an effective high school Spanish teacher. His accent is very Anglo and his grammar is not always correct. His method may be a cute gimmick, but his students are going to sound funny to somebody who knows the language."
5,BOBBY THE MAGICAL JUGGLING CLOWN,"I allmost didn't buy this cool CD because of a listener that left a bad review Toro NYC. He said something about ""hace frio"" is correct and ""esta frio"" is wrong. I bought it anyway and nowhere on the CD does it say either of these words. I guess he has a right to say anything he wants. Actually at my level of Spanish who cares. Either way a spanish speaking person will figure out that I am cold."
4,In The Hood,"Donell Jones brings a different aspect to the R&B game. When you listen to a Donell Jones album you don't get average singing, average tunes, and average lyrics. That's what sets him apart. He doesn't have to try so hard to make a hit his songs just come from the heart and people feel him. Not the greatest singer in the world but something about him glows; I can't exactly put my finger on it. With songs like ""Natural Thing"", Wish You Were Here, My Heart, All About You and In The Hood, his music will keep you feeling all good inside. While you at the crib gone head and slip this in just as yo lady walks in. Trust Me. 4.5 stars."
5,Unbelievable Artist!!,"Donell Jones is one my favorite artists.He has released three albums to date but this one happens to have my favorite track on it (My Heart).Stand out tracks on this album are In the Hood, no interruptions, My Heart!,Yearnin & natural thing.This man is a absolute genius to sing,write & produce this amazing music! hurry up & make a fourth album please Donell!Keep doin that thang you do"
3,Slow and sexy,Donell gives it nice and mellow...Just how I like it...This CD makes you feel like he is speaking to just you...(-_-)
3,Not as hot as the new one,I bought this one because the new one blew me away. This is not as good in comparison but it is still better than most of the watered down stuff you hear today.I would say 5 or 6 of the tracks are worth listening to and In The Hood is the best track
1,"on my knees, baby please, yada, yada, yada","i question the musical appreciation of those who like this album. maybe, i'm even worse b/c i own DJ's 1st & 2nd album ... this album like the 2nd, is extremely trite. w/o question #1 & #2 are HOT, but if you listen to most of his songs (more than 1nce), you come to realize that the lyrics are nonsensical & uninspiring. that is DJ's trademark: tight musical stylings, mediocre singing & WACK lyrics. unfortunately, most of the album lacks musical substance of the standout tracks, which makes the overall album unbearable. i considered giving DJ 2 stars, but 1 of the few goods songs was a remake (btw, Stevie did it better!)."
5,Well produced collection of good music with a message.,"Great eclectic mix of r&b gospel. Contemporary in its feel, CeCe has come up with a cross-over album that bears repeating. Good beat, well-produced, great arrangements make this one to have in your collection. Inspiring and uplifting music for the soul."
4,I like it,Cece this cd is pretty good i like it better than ur first solo cd but i have to admit it is not as good as what u and bebe had
2,Disappointed,Because of the well spoken reviews I took the chance to buy this CD. But I must say it showed to be too boring to listen to. I don't think I will ever play it again!
5,One of Cece's best,This is an early Cece solo album. It is so profound and soulful it might be hard to compare to some of her other CDs. This is a wonderful and blessed project. God bless Sis. Winans.
5,love em,"I love the high fiber and protein content and low sugar. Kids really like them and even the picky husband did too. Much more crunchy than other 'O' cereals. I mix it in with yogurt and fruit, tasty."
4,Ecopak Heritage Os,"Be good to the environment and save on packaging. Heritage Os are slightly greater in calorie content than the flakes but they are more crunchy and have a bit more ""earthy"" flavor."
3,key word is crunchy,"if you haven't figured it out yet, Crunchy is the most distinguishing feature of these Os, for me it's beyond what I enjoy as a bfast cereal. The taste is fine, and they're not HARD in a hurt-teeth way (so not corn-nuts), but they'll ring yer ears. We're gradually finishing off our box by mixing it into trail mix (perfect fit with nuts) or just as a dry snack."
5,addictive little crunchy Os!,"I am obsessed with these Os. You will never - no, never - return to regular old General Mills Cheerios, because there's no comparison. For the review who found these ""too crunchy"" - - you're wrong. They're the perfect specimen of what a breakfast (-lunch, -dinner) cereal should be."
4,"Organic ""Cheerios""","I bought this just to test them out. As others have stated, they are super crunchy. I like to put a little honey on mine to sweeten them up, but plain is just fine too."
2,"WoW, I finally found it!","Remember ""Raw Bits"", that cereal sponsor for the ""Prairie Home Companion""? The one made from ""oat hulls and wheat shafts""? By George I think I've found it! YES!!! This is the number one most crunchy thing on the planet, which is edible. I've not broken a tooth yet, but my ears still ring from eating it. And I tried to like it. At first I thought I liked it. Later I thought I hated it. Then I decided that I was missing the point; ""Raw Bits"" is not about flavor, it's about commitment, it's about doing the right thing, it's about put up and shut up. Think about your Norwegian Bachelor Farmer ancestors, for gosh sakes! Do you suppose that they whined about their cereal not ""tasting good enough""? Of course not!Eating Heritage O's/Raw Bits gives shy people the courage to get up and do what needs to be done!(Now could someone please help me find those tasty and expeditious ""Powder Milk Biscuits""?)"
1,Do you love cardboard?,I really wanted to love this product but the taste is so bland and boring that I thought I was eating cardboard. Buy this for someone who really has no taste buds but wants to eat healthy! Sorry you guys. )-:
5,ORGANIC CEREAL,The bagged Natures Path Organic cereal is a superior product made with pure ingredients. The only problem is UPS sometimes leaves the box without making sure I'm home and the product sits in the extremely hot sun. Sometimes the box is hot even if I am home which leads me to believe UPS is not keeping it cool enough in the truck and/or storage. So far it hasn't seemed to harm the cereal but it has harmed a Horizon milk product I recently bought. These food products should have better handling by UPS.
2,"Not Bad, But Not a Cheerios Replacement","I got these hoping they'd be a healthy alternative and low cost option for our family's breakfast. Unfortunately, my son has balked at this super-crunchy, wheaty-tasting cereal and, frankly, my husband isn't that big a fan either. They taste very ""raw"" (can't think of a better word for it) and, no matter how long you soak them in milk, they never seem to soften even slightly. These may be pluses for some people, but if you're looking for an organic Cheerio replacement, as I was, you'd be better off with ""Barbara's Bakery Organic Breakfast O's Cereal"" (also sold on Amazon, though priced higher per oz.)."
2,Way too hard,"The Heritage O's are way too hard. Although my dogs like them (all 12 of them), I'm going to stick with the Heritage Flakes. They don't get soggy either and my teeth are much safer."
3,What mummy?,"They should call it ""The Mummy's Wrappings"". Ahhh...look out, bandages are coming after you, flying through the air. Worst Mummy movie I've seen, I gave it 3 stars only because the Mummy is my favorite movie monster. Stick to the Brendan Frasier movies if you're just a casual watcher. ******Spoiler Alert*******If you are a Gerard Butler fan, he's not even in the opening credits. So, of course he gets killed off early. Too bad, he and the crazy guy seeing visions are the only interesting characters in the whole movie. Lee is supremely unimpressive. The ending is lame too."
1,Don't waste your money!,This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A real waste of money and time. How a director/producer can take a decent actor and make a dumb movie is beyond me...why waste the time. The plot never made it and the characters were just not there. Make it short--don't buy it.
1,completely ... a waste of time,"Except for the actress, the movie is totally a soup of nonsense ...thanks to the script writer."
5,One of the best Mummy movies ever!!!!!!!!!,"This is one heck of a mummy movie.The beginning of the movie awesome and the end of the film is shocking....!!! It stars Christopher Lee and Jason Scott Lee(no relation)and Michael Lerner and Shelley Duvall.This mummy movie has everything in it.This is one of the best mummy movies ever made!It takes place in London England and lots great views of the city and among other places.The acting isn`t bad at all although there is not that much comedy in it like The Mummy or The Mummy Returns but this is one serious mummy.I`LL tell you this,I rented the movie when it first came out and I liked it so much I bought it!Trust ME,if you havn`t seen it yet rent it ASAP!!!You`ll probaly want to buy it.This is one of the best mummy pictures and you just can`t miss this.I rate it four stars****!!!For it`s superb story,great effects and well,for it great mummy stuff.WOW this is great!!!"
2,Even Jack Davenport can't save this!,What a joke of a movie. As much as I love Jack Davenport even he couldn't save this bomb.
1,A good idea gone horribly wrong...,"""Tale of the Mummy"" attempts to shake up the typical methodology of ""mummy"" movies by intertwining a murder mystery along with the evil one's approaching re-birth. The FX of the regenerating mummy's wrappings is the best part of the movie. Jason Scott Lee's pedestrian performance drags down each and every scene that he stumbles into. The flash-back sequences of the how the ""mummy"" came into being is so confusing and stupid that it makes the entire movie utterly pointless. Although the ending was somewhat original, it left me wondering why I had endured an hour and half of this tripe."
2,Only for Ronan...,"Yeah, you probably don't know who Ronan Vibert played in this film-- he was in the beginning... he went down to look at the mummy w/ Christopher Lee's character. And he said something cocky.. he had those goggles on and was drinking champagne I believe, and then.. got killed by the mummy after trying to climb up the rope...yeah that's all I saw the movie for, and to be honest I fell asleep during the movie... even though it was an OK movie.Eh whatever... don't waste your money though. It's not THAT great.... although Ronan's part was funny lol.."
2,"Work fine, but don't last","Good traits.- They do take getting used to, but if they are free around your neck they stay in fine.-Sound quality is fine for running headphones-If you need to hear your surroundings, you can always invert them and they hand above your ears.Bad traits.They DO NOT last. I had one pair for about 6 months and one of the buds just went dead after it faded in and out for a week. I liked the functionality so I got another pair, and it also lasted about 6 months until they had the same problem. The left bud just dies, happened to both pair, seems to be a fault of the product that the same thing happens twice. Not good enough life for the price. I'll be trying something different."
1,Junk,The right ear speaker stopped working after about 3 months and I hardly ever used them. Just junk.
2,Great sound. Poor reliability.,"I bought these headphones a few months ago to run with. Hooked them up to the iPod Nano and they sounded great; loud, crisp and clear. For me they are also comfortable and stay in the ear while running perfectly. They also don't seem to 'tire' out my ear lobes or make them sore after a while. I have probably run with them about 60-90 times over the course of the past couple of months. Today, sadly, the left headphone started crackling and then one hundred feet later it died altogether. Looking to try to return them for a warranty exchange if I can. Maybe if you dont use them for serious working out they might last, but based on mine and others 'mileage' with them, your twenty dollars may be better spent elsewhere."
1,Don't use these for running,I bought these to use when I go jogging. They did not stay in my ears at all! Every time I turned my head to check for cars they would pop out. Even strong wind to one side of my head would create enough slack in the loop for the opposite side to pop out.
3,Still confused about the design...,"I just received this in the mail today. They are very light, but when I wear them as I think they're meant to be worn, they don't stay in my ears at all. However, my mom suggested that I try wearing them a different way (with the side marked ""R"" on my left ear, the side marked ""L"" on my right ear, and the curved parts hooked over each ear - so basically back-to-front and upside-down), and this seems to work far better. No joke. They don't fall out at all. They're still a tad bit uncomfortable, but they seem like they'd actually work pretty well for running. I'm still not sure if the ""L""/""R"" markings are misplaced and the headphones are actually supposed to be worn this way or not. So give it a shot the other way, maybe that'll work for you too. Oh, and they are $18.99 if you buy from amazon and not from this seller. Just search for Nike HJ020."
1,Save your $,"I am very disappointed in these headphones. The sound quality isn't good and they will not stay in place when I run, row or use my stationary bike."
2,Returning them,"They sounded faint and lacked any kind of bass. Plus, the slightest movement of the plug caused it to crackle (not a solid connection). Perhaps I just had a bad pair."
2,Comfortable but not secure,"After trying the Sennheiser PMX70 Sport headphones, I tried the Nike Flight HJ022. The Nike headphones are definitely less pressurized, softer, and lighter, but what good is that when they don't stay on? I guess it's fine if you never need to wear a jacket; anything near the back of your neck makes them move out of place. Maybe there just isn't a perfect sport headphone."
1,Abject failure of stated goal.,"These headphones have an intrinsic inability to stay in my ears, or even remain attached to my head, during exercise. If they can't achieve even that, what's the point of them?"
1,Nike HJ020 Flight Sport headphones (Electronics),I agree with the other one star reviewers. This product is junk. I bought it at the end of April. By early November it stopped working completely. Barely 6 months of use. I advise against buying this product.
1,Not worth it.,"Purchased these headphones about 10 days ago and already one side is not working. Fit was poor and always falling out. Sound quality is ok, but I am not an audiophile and really how good does sound quality have to be when you are exercising. The cord does not excessively sway due to shortness, but if you are tall (like my exercise partner) be ready for a pulling sensation. One good thing about the poor fit is that traffic is easy to hear so there is little chance of getting run over from a car you didn't hear."
2,Don't fit my head AT ALL!,"The plastic on these headphones is molded in a way that fixes the distance between the ears. I must have a bit of a narrow head and small ear canals. These don't stay in my ears and aren't comfortable. A complete waste.Also, I you can't lay down and wear these earphones because of the way the back is structure. So they aren't good for napping or airplane reclining."
2,Decent sound - yet uncomfortable,"Purchased this to use with an MP3 player at the gym. They have decent sound, but weren't too comfortable. Every time you turn your head, the little bar on the back hits your neck and pulls the earbuds out of your ear. I'm going to return these and get either the Sony h.ear or a regular behind-the-head model."
2,Running yes - but nothing else,I returned these after the first day. If you want to use these for anything other than running - get something else.
1,fall out when running - one side quit working after few months,They seemed good for the 1st few weeks but after that the headphones started slipping while I was running and 1 side would keep popping out of my ear. I stopped using them much but within a 4 or 5 months one side stopped working completely.
1,Dont last long... One side stop working,I bought this product twice and the same thing happen.- Dont last long- One side stop workingDon't recommend them at all
3,"Great sound, poor design","I was looking for some headphones to use with my new ipod touch while working-out, i was enticed by these because of the way the cord runs from the back and figured it wudnt disturb me, which it doesnt. The sound quality is great (better than the ipod's), but i dont if it's just my ears but they dont seem to fit, i hav a hard time gettin them to fit in my ear and when they do it's very uncomfortable. Makes no sense if u cant use them find somethng with a simpler design"
4,"Best for Running, Get a different kind for sedentary activity","Over the years I have had several pairs of these. I'm always enticed by something that might be better. Simply put, I've run marathons (slowly) and barely noticed the things sitting there. They stay put, they don't hurt, the sound is as good as I need for running, and I can hear traffic as is approaches from behind easily. Yes, they're cheap, but Radio Shack sells simple earbud covers which work to replace the plastic ring. At $19.95 you can buy a couple of these for the price of many poorer working earbuds. I don't use these for other purposes, if you want ""High Fidelity"" when you're sitting still, get a better pair of loose fitting earbuds. P.S. My wife fell in love with these for running as well, there are pairs all over the house."
3,Great for running BUT...,"After trying a two other styles of headphones, I found that these were very comfortable and that I did not have to constantly adjust the earpieces. Unfortunately, as noted in several other reviews, they are not made particularly well. The left ear piece appears to have shorted out so I only have sound coming from the right speaker. I would buy another pair but at this point would rather wait for the entire headset to give out."
1,Terrible...just terrible,I bought these to replace a pair of Sennheisers that needed to be sent in for replacement. I ran all of one block with these. The problems are as follows:1. The headphones do not stay in place. This is especially true if you turn your head from side to side.2. The headphones I received were poorly finished; an edge of the rubber seal on the ear piece scratched the inside of my ear. It did not help that they kept shifting in my ear as I moved my head around.3. I felt tons of cord bounce on my collar and on the back of my neck.Try it before you make your decision. It might save you twenty bucks.
4,RUN OVER 70 MI A WEEK WITH THESE,"LOVE THESE! I RUN 10-13 MILES A DAY WITH THESE, AND MANY MARATHONS. COMFY AND STAY PUT! A GREAT VALUE AND A GREAT PRODUCT"
2,don't like them for working out,"Mine do not stay in at all when using the elliptical (with arm motion), but do okay on the treadmill. I have totally given up trying to do weights with them in b/c they are constantly falling out."
3,nice buy!,Curious George Party Cake Topper SetI like this cake topper because after the occasion my baby can play with it. Also it is a set that is nice on his first birthday cake and cheaper than the others being sold on the site.
4,Easy and cute,"This cake topper is definitely super easy to use and cute. The ""Curious George"" label helps bc it's hard to tell that the monkey is actually him, since it's so small. Good simple solution to make a cake look Curious George festive!"
4,Wok,"Got this for my Dad and he likes it. It did have a small chip when they got it, but they kept the item and are still using it....I would have sent it back."
2,sent back,"I didnt like it I sent for it twice actually ,I tought maybe the first ne I retuned was a return the way it looked but the second one it looked about the same the lid had finger marks andthe way was packed it didnt looked like a new item."
2,Mediocre at best,"The first two or three times I used this Wok, I loved it. Now that I've had it a few months, I don't recommend buying it.Pros: Large, feels sturdy, Looks cool, easy to clean.Cons:Washing it ONLY with a soft, nylon sponge, the non-stick coating is flaking a LOT- this is not just disappointing but unsanitary as it flakes off into the food.The temperature dial doesn't change the temperature- it heats up hot for a shorter period of time when on low than on high. So you get your wok too hot for a short time then too cold for a short time.The lid has a dial to adjust how much moisture it lets out. It doesn't work.Summary- if I could return it at this point, I would."
4,Works great after a year,"I love it. We have had it for about 1 year. We connect it outside during the summer so cooking doesn't heat up the house. It heats fast, retains food moisture, and food taste great. It is a bit heavy and a bit bulky to clean but if you wash right away you can easily rinse it out and clean with a sponge. Nevertheless, it is awesome be be able to cook without having to worry about fire or having to stand there and stare at the food until it is ready. I bought it because I like to let my food cook without me having it to watch it too closely and this wok is perfect for that."
2,Only OK,"I have cashmere lined leather gloves from neiman's which i love, and wear all the time when i want to be a bit dressy in cold weather. So I was excited to find these for about 30 percent less $, as they should be for an online source (I think). However I was disappointed because the cashmere is of a poor quality, so they are a bit rough, like regular wool. The leather is good though, so at least they look good! I have the silk lined from this source as well, and i like them, though they are not for really cold weather."
2,"Beautiful gloves, but...","These are beautiful gloves, but for $80 you would expect the liner to last past 2 winters in North Carolina. My wife doesn't use them to shovel, etc., but the liners need replacing. The leather hardly looks used.We have no idea how to get them re-lined, so I guess they get tossed as they are now uncomfortable to wear.Not a good value."
2,Color not what I expected.,"I ordered the red gloves thinking they were a 'normal' red. When they arrived they were very bright, almost orange in color. Just not my style."
4,Interesting and Easy to Read.,"Bought it cause I had to for class. If you're in the same predicament than a review doesn't matter, does it? Anyways, it's pretty easy to read, but it's pretty dated."
1,Why was this made!,What a depressing film! So much talent such a bad script. This film did not meet any expectation. Run as fast as you can.
2,"Great product, if it worked flawlessly","It only works 20% of the time. It's very rare that the PS2 reads it as a game disk and not an error disk. On top of that, when it is working well it sometimes freezes the console's visuals. When It worked, it was great. But be careful, if you PS2 is not brand-spanking new, it won't work that well."
2,I Agree with Mr. Concerned...,"I had the EXACT same problem. I've been troubleshooting it for days now by doing the following:- Deleting/Reinstalling the Update for my system- Buying a brand-new OFFICIAL Sony PS2 memory card- Trying other PS2's- Buying a GameSharkAll attempts end in the same result: System locks up and you have to restart the machine (including the GameShark, interestingly enough), which makes me think that some how the code update is corrupt or it corrupts memory cards. The code list never loads after installing the newest update. If you delete the update, the list loads fine, but you don't have any of the newer PS2 games.I've pretty much given up at this point (I just tried the new memory card this morning). The only option left is to re-download the system update and delete it every time I want to play a game that isn't in the list or input the codes manually, which I'd prefer not to do, but I may have to in order to get this thing up and running again. Most frustrating!"
1,CORRUPTS MEMORY CARD!!,this product is a WASTE OF MONEY. It has a history of corrupting memory cards as i've found out too late. you memory card gets erased and you can no longer use it at all. this happened to me on the second day that i owned the Max Drive (action replay- EVO).there is no customer service at all and you basically kiss your $$ goodbye for this thing as well as completely ruin your memory card.DO NOT BUY!!!
2,Works great for 1st 3 months,"Do not purchase. I have bought 2 copies of this and in both instances, it worked for the first 3 months and then wouldn't go online to download codes nor would it even load the codes already stored on the flash card. This rendered both copies useless. Customer service is non-existent both on their website and by phone. When you call them (not toll free), you get an answering maching asking to leave your name and number for someone to call you back. So far, no one has returned my call and I have two $40 coasters now. Stay away, stay very far away from this product or any of their other AR products since I've had similar problems with all of their products."
5,No problem with this product.,"I have not had any problems with this product. It works fine on my PS2 and my PS3(for PS2 games obviously), for all games I have used. The only thing that did not work on my PS3 was the internet function (can't when them all)."
5,A true classic,"Perhaps the most intuitive and self revealing among Kieslowski's films, ""No End"" explores a duality of stories which interweave in their support of the truth. Both political and self exploring, this film further established Grazyna Szapolowska as perhaps the most sensual actress in today's film community. Her depiction as a tortured survivor and a savior to a cause of others' choosing seals her fate which results in the most noble of surrenders at film's end. Wanting to pull the tape off the vents, open your arms for her embrace, and set her soul free to move along, you must be content to simply watch the unraveling of life and the surrender of a soul. The Szapolowska/Kieslowski pairing makes for a wonderful film experience for the viewer who might continue to debate the ""what ifs"" long after its viewing. An honor to watch."
4,"A great movie, a great director","I was happy to find another great movie to buy. I bought this one taking the chance, because I never have heard anything of it. But once again Kieslowski take over deep fellings and a complex speech, opening a door of sensations. Great movie."
2,"For the Rawlings ""Playmaker"" series!","A couple years ago I bought several BB gloves to someday play catch with my son. Pulled them out & all were fine except the Rawlings Playmaker glove I'd bought for myself. All the top layer of ""leather"" on the back had flaked off! Yes, purely cosmetic but a very poor showing from what used to be the top company. Others are Mizuno & Spaulding, I'd recommend them."
3,Not as colorful as the picture,"I was a little disappointed. The actual colors were not that bright or colorful. It was really more earthy in color. Browns, greys, whites, a pale purple, but mostly browns and greys. I was hoping it would look as bright and varied as the photo. Otherwise, it was very much as pictured. Cute, but not exactly what I was hoping for."
5,wordsthattranspire,"I would just like to say to any woman out there contemplating the purchase of this book, don't wait, hit ""purchase with one click"" now! Not only will you enjoy every word, the message will be imprinted on your heart forever. It is the most transforming lesson from Mary's perspective any woman can hope to gleen while living in this world.A kinship with Mary will develop and you will never look at motherhood the same way again. Enjoy."
4,"Pretty good, but not their best","This is a pretty good debut for TLC and is pretty much one of my fave albums of theirs getting close to FanMail. They definitely can rap and sing. Some good stuff is Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg, What About Your Friends, and pretty much all of the songs on the album."
4,4.5 stars,"For awhile now, I had all of TLC's albums except for this one. (I have a weird tendency to purchase an artist's discography backwards.) Anyway, I finally bought it and when I popped it into my CD player, I listened to it threee times straight through. I absolutely love it! It's so fun and energetic. This is obviously the album that Left Eye had the creative control on. Every song is great, especially ""His Story."" I also loved ""Intermission I."" Funny stuff. This is definitely one of those albums you clean your house to, or you can just listen to it without any disruptions. Either way, I highly recommend."
4,"It's fun,fresh and hip","I think this alblum shows that they can be fun,cool and sexy at the same time.What I liked about it is that it shows a new approch to music as we see it today.I would enjoy it more if it hade more variaty,and a little more energy and maturity other than that I enjoyed it."
5,"TLC Coffee, I take it black.","This is a great cd to play when you're waking up in the morning, highly caffinated jamz by TLC. Most of the songs have cool 90's hip hop dance beats with Left Eye rappin' along and goin' crazy. I like every song, except ""somethin' u wanna know"", that song is average. There is an even mix of TBoz, Chili and Left Eye on the tracks so you get the whole TLC treatment. I wish LeftEye was still around so TLC could release a new album. I recently played all of their cds and I forgot how much I liked them."
4,GREAT DEBUT! ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I OWN!,"I listened to this album fully for the first time about two years ago and I must say, it's off the hook even though it was released 13 years ago. Wow! L.A. Reid and Babyface surely knew what they were doing when they signed this group. This is one of the best girl groups of all time. They have sold millions of records and not even Destiny's Child, oops, I mean Beyonce & Destiny's child can top this groups' success. What I like about this group is none of the members ever hogged the spotlight like Beyonce did. They were equals and also different. Overall, great album. Even though it's 13 years old, it's a must buy."
4,great cd,"This is perhaps my favorite TLC cd. They're so spunky and though there isn't a lot of the smooth cool TLC sounds of the current cd, it's a happy cd. Features a lot of raps from Left Eye."
4,"A fun, young debut project by the ladies of LaFace...","TLC, a young female trio sporting cross-colours and adhesives (band-aids, condoms), stormed the charts in the beginning of '92, with the incredibly catchy ""Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg,"" and the friendship anthem ""What About You Friends,"" both of which feature production from Dallas Austin. Other fun tracks are ""Hat 2 Da Back,"" a mere fashion/independent female anthem, and the feel-good ballad, ""Baby, Baby, Baby,"" produced by L.A., Babyface and Daryl Simmons. One listen of this album will give the young and exciting pop music appeal..."
2,Scratched,"Half of the songs on this CD were scratched. However, the seller did make it a priority to send me the tape."
5,TLC's first album has the most fun,"I loved this album! I like their new release, Fan Mail, but I think their first album is still my favorite. I love ""Das Da Way We Like 'Em"", ""What About Your Friends"" and ""Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg""! They were way ahead of their time and showed that independence and being comfortable with your sexuality is ok! And they're so cute, and hey -- smart cuz they promote SAFE SEX! Definite role models for nineties women and the new millenium. You go girls!"
4,A great product for my dog.,I adopted this dog and he was taking this product at his former home. I was not able to get it other places but found it on Amazon. I was thrilled to be able to get the Calming formula at a good price and so quickly.
3,Im not a rocker so listen up...,"I listen to all kinds of music and im not at all a scene person . so this cd is a bit weak , yes. they have potential but if they get any worse then start adding pop loop lyrics , they will become limp bizket . they need to get heavier . the rapper in this group doesnt sound so bad but he needs to write from the soul . not your typical rap song of how tough you are etc. ...these kinds of bands are not for people who only listen to rock cause most of them hate rap from the start but more for us variety people who dont own to a scene . i grew up on all kinds of music and had an open mind , so if youre looking for a rocker tastefull rap/rock cd i would say go with ''reveille'' . if you want a heavier hip hop sound ''primer 55'' .. a bit toned down you say :) ''faction of the fox'' or ''E-town concrete''"
3,Workout,Decent workout. Each 15 min segment only has 3 or so exercises. It's enough to get your heart-rate up but certainly not a workout for your whole body. I don't know why they couldn't add a bunch more segments....
1,Break Time,A terrible video. 1/3 of it is standing around watching them talk among themselves taking a break. I did not pay to watch people talk. Save your money on this one.
4,Perfect for quick at home workouts,So far I've used the video a few times and I have to admit it is a great way for me to squeeze in a workout at home! I would recommend getting it if you have very little time and just need to do something when you have the chance!
2,For Beginners Only,"The four workouts on this dvd are extremely simple, which might be what you're looking for. If you're a moderate athlete with little time to spare, the description is enticing, but the outcome is unremarkable. I've been rotating through the workouts each day for a couple weeks, and the only noticeable result has been soreness from one of the lower body exercises in ""Ground Force."" If you simply have no other way of being active, this is a good buy. Otherwise, be sure to integrate other exercises to the workouts. I've been adding push-ups and plank exercises after each workout, and they complement each other adequately."
2,This book is creepy.,"Well, where do I start with this book? There is a hunchback in this book and heeeeee scares the crap outta me. And everybody is in a very bad mood the whole entire time. And SPOILER ALERT, the hunchback doesn't die. But he does have a hunched back and it kinda looks like Quazimoto but I don't know why. He just does. He has a teapot. It's like in Beauty and the Beast. It's zero degrees right now in Utah, fyi. Sunny. In an hour it'll be 18 degrees, I doubt that. I have to take out the trash at my work...it's snowy. don't read this book and if you do only read it because of the Hunchback. That's the only good thing about life, people have hunchbacks and we can laugh at them.3B Scientific Chemistry Cocktail Set for Drink Mixing"
3,Like nothing I've read before,"The plot seemed so real. While reading the book, my dad had told me my aunt had once had to stay overnight at someone's home because of a simlar event like the one in the book, the book kinda hit close to home. I never had read any of Elie Wiesel's books before, but checked the book out of the library after reading the inside cover and deciding that the plot would be interesting and make a good story. However, I was disappointed. I really felt that Wiesel could have expanded a lot more on the plot. I didn't feel like I knew the charcters well enough. I didn't understand why the ending ended the way it did. It wasn't the best book I read, but it wasn't the worst."
3,"Mr. Wiesel should have just had ""Q"" show up.","Mr. Wiesel is pretty good at developing characters, however he doesn't pay attention to the reality of details. It is not just implausible for the characters to end up at the cabin it is virtually impossible. The events getting the characters to the cabin is simply not realistic. It would have been a better story and a more reasonable if ""Q"" (Star Trek) had showed up and transported them there.I am a cowgirl from Arizona and I would have put up with the Judges nonsense for about 15 minutes max. Then I would have acted. Mr. Wiesel spend why too much time on thought and not enough on action. Whatever."
4,Lots of knowledge in a small book.,We bought this book on a whim for our son who was interested in ants. He had an ant farm and asked so many questions about ants that we simply had no idea the answer to everything on his mind. This book taught all of us more than we expected to learn about ants. Great and easy read for young readers.
3,You had to not be there,"Nice little tid bit from Kinky, but truly for those with little familiarity of Austin. Having said that, do you think it's still possible to find Willy on his golf course?"
2,"Nice watch, but not classic Movado","I was fairly excited when I first saw this watch. Upon trying it on at the local jewelry store, I was not that impressed. The problem with this watch is that it fails to incorporate the beauty of the classic Movado timepieces. In addition to being great watches, Movados tend to have a signature look. When people look at your watch, they know it is a Movado. Not so here. Your money would be better spent on one of the more classic Movados.I believe this is a watch that looks better in photos than it does on the wrist. Be sure to try it on before ordering."
3,"Damn, sounds like a let down","When I saw the back drop story for this game way back when, i litterally shat my pants. Being kind of a history buff and a semi RPG fan i wanted to play this game so badly. Sounds from reading the forums and these reviews that the game was FUBAR'ed like they were actually trying to make it bad. Sounds to me like the creative directors made a bad hand off to the dev team who in turn made a even worse hand off to the coders."
5,childrens book,expected book to be used so I was not surprised by worn edges but was still in great condition and shipped in promised time
3,Not like my old favourite.,"I bought this because like many I had Bubble Bobble and Rainbow Islands as a youngster.I know there have been pseudo-sequels to both of those games that ended up divating greatly from the simple platform, jump, collect and kill that made the game addictive and replayable.I have a PSP and when I say this was coming I got right in line for my copy.I understood from the game description there were some differences.I didn't realise just how many!The tower idea for both dragons was well thought up, but for hardened gamers like myself who were looking for the spark of the original game I was disappointed.The game was HARD! It had very little replay value and in the end I gave up.I'm not sorry I bought it. Just sorry I bought it when it first came out and was full price.Someone whose never played the originals might enjoy it more."
3,Not enough like bubble bobble,"I thought this game would be like bubble bobble (my whole family liked bubble bobble), but it wasn't. Doesn't make it bad, just makes it not what I thought it would be."
3,bad advertising,"As far as the product (1 switch ) i thought it was bad advertising, i Was under the understanding that it was for the panel with switches, not just one switch. If i would of know i would not of ordered it."
1,Healthy but inedible,Bought them for my daughter who is allergic to wheat and dairy. They taste like ground up old shoes that have been baked too long....
5,The best Big Mountain cd to date,One of the best raggae cd's I have ever heard. Rastaman and Beautiful day are the greatest.
5,Tori the artist,"Three songs on this album are masterpieces: black dove (january), Playboy Mommy and Jackie's Strength. They reach inside you and touch real emotions. I listened. I cried. Tori is a rare artist that can draw emotion from the listener. She is worth our attention. Thanks Tori."
5,Tori Amos - From the Choirgirl Hotel (1998),Spark - 10/10Cruel - 10/10Black-Dove (January) - 10/10Raspberry Swirl - 10/10Jackie's Strength - 10/10i i e e e - 10/10Liquid Diamonds - 10/10She's Your Cocaine - 9/10Northern Lad - 10/10Hotel - 10/10Playboy Mommy - 10/10Pandora's Aquarium - 9/10118/120My Top 5...1) Cruel2) i i e e e3) Black-Dove (January)4) Spark5) Jackie's Strength
4,Another pleasing album,"Even though I am completley biased about anything she does because I absolutely love her, I still reccomend this album because ""Spark"" and ""Raspberry Swirl"" are alone worth buying this album. Maybe you guys out there would disagree but for the ladies I say go get it girl!"
4,Awesome,"This disc is the 4th of 6 disc's i have of Tori Amos, and this didn't fail to blow me away just like the rest of her music. Tori is a brilliant artist, with emotional and heavy lyrics, and From the Chiorgirl Hotel fits right in. Raspberry Swirl, and Playboy Mommy are great songs, not to mention Cruel and She's you cocaine."
4,"4 and 1/2 stars, really","I love this album, almost every song (hence the 4 and 1/2). Tori's melodies are gorgeous, as always. You can get lost in the songs simply because of their wonderful, enveloping sound. Her lyrics are also great, peppered with both biting irony and emotional vulnerability. ""She's Your Cocaine"" is my least favorite song on the record, having a hard edge to it that doesn't really appeal to me but may to you, and ""Hotel"" doesn't float my boat either. Every other song is worthy of repeated listening (over and over and over...)."
5,A brilliant album - to say the least !!!!,"I have been a Tori fan since I was 11, that was when I first heard ""Little Earthquakes"" and the one song that really got my attention was ""Crucify"". I was humming it all the time. So I got the CD, and there was no turning back. But with from the choirgirl hotel, I was really surprised how a artist could grow so fast, and with such sudden changes. I have always know that Tori was a brilliant singer, but now, with ""Raspberry Swirl"", my friends are agreeing...... I have all the albums and I just love listening them in any kind of order, just to see a rainbow of emotions..."
4,Tori Amos is great-,"I like virtually everthing about this album. Tori Amos's voice is hauntingly appealing. The music is equally as captivating. I didnt' like her previous albums. But this album is different-more listenable, perhaps more 'musical' and loud. It really show's Amos's growth as an artist and as a musician.I was orginally attracted to this album because I saw the video for the song Spark on MTV. It was very dark and Twin Peaks-like. When I bought the album, I noticed that it is actually quite dark in theme. I like this because it's not afraid to let emotion come through. My favorite track is Northern Lad. Tori Amos sings with such feeling in this song it brought tears to my eyes, and made me think of my x-girlfriend. It's not a cursory album, it's true. What I discovered after living with this album for a while is that I'm now a Tori Amos fan and may now go have to buy her other albums!"
4,Tori Proves She is Superior No Matter What the Genre,"My first listen to this CD, I was incredibly disappointed. As a huge Toriphile, I was hoping for another ""girl and the piano"" CD. After all, that IS Tori. However, the more times I listen to it, I realize even more what a fantastic artist Tori is. While she has long proven that there is no equal to her in the style of her first three albums, she has now shown that even when she takes on a genre that is filled to capacity with competition, she outshines them as well. I still admit, I prefer the non-techno Tori by far. But this album continues to grow on me, as it is far superior to any others of its ilk. And for the traditional Tori fan, she has never shone better than with ""Jackie's Strength"", an ode to Jackie Kennedy. It has quickly become one of my favorites."
5,Are You Sure Where My Spark Is......,"I have all of Tori's CDs except for ""Y Kant Tori Read"". I love her voice with her piano, but this CD was a nice change. Some songs had a lot of other instruments in it, but others were based solely around the piano. I may love the music either way, but Tori's voice will always be the same..beautiful. :)"
4,Changes but not development.,There are some radical changes on this CD but I wont say it's development. She hasn't reached any further in her compositon although she's not completly the same. She still has the cool Tori touch which makes her so if that moves you I'm sure you wont be disapointed with this CD.
3,Not her best...,"I have to admit this is not one of Tori's best attempts. Little Earthquakes is by far her best work yet...so intense, so filled with emotion, so moving. Choirgirl is a whole lot of noise and not much feeling, in my opinion. Sure you'll end up be-boppin' around your living room, but that's not ""her"" music; not the music I fell in love with anyway. Don't get me wrong, I adore Tori and I'll always be a loyal fan, but I'm slightly dissapointed in this album."
1,Sad,"Tori's career is a sad story. After a stunning debut album (""Little Earthquakes"") and an impressive follow up (""Under The Pink"") she has slowly sunk into self-pardoy with her last album (""Boys For Pele"") and this one.Here, Tori does little to dispel her growing image of a man hating whiner, so caught up in her self absorbstion in the name of ""art"" to have anything compelling to say. Sure, there are a few pretty melodies here, but nothing that comes even remotely close to breaking any new ground for her.Let's face it. Until she proves otherwise, Tori will simply be an artist who has run out of musical ideas with a following that borders on the fanatical.It is sad, given the fact that Tori has shown she is capable of great music."
1,poorly executed!,"Tori, whose music was once fresh and innovative, has unfortunately lapsed into the formulaic and unimaginative. By replacing emotion-laden piano chords with the cold and distant sounds of electronica, Tori has managed to alienate her older fans who initially formed the bulk of her support. Ultimately, however, Tori will continue moving in the revenue-producing path she has started on; after all, it's much easier (and inexpensive) to loop together beats on a drum machine, than it is to compose a piece of real, heart-felt music..."
5,My favorite Tori album.,"From The Choirgirl Hotel is without a doubt my favorite Tori Amos album. I like the ""plugged"" sound of the songs. It's the one I appreciate most as a whole, because I love almost every single song. ""She's Your Cocaine"" is the singular exception-- it's grating and I have no idea why it's there. (When I burned myself a copy to take to college with me, I replaced that track with the studio version of ""Cooling."" I recommend you do the same thing... with the Tori track of your choice, of course.)""Spark"" is a strong first track, with a mesmerizing bassline; ""Black-Dove (January)"" is hypnotically beautiful and dark; ""Jackie's Strength"" is glorious. ""Northern Lad"" is my favorite song; a moving piano ballad featuring one of my favorite lyrics of all time: ""I guess you go to far when pianos try to be guitars..."""
5,should have gotten more attentions,"This is a great Tori Amos Album, definetely one of my favorites. Unfortantely it did not do as well as her previous work despite the fact that she pulled off a new sound really well. This is the first album that she really uses other musicians other than herself. THere are plenty of great songs like Spark, Rasberry Girl and She's your Cocaine just go to show that."
5,From the talented girl.,"""From The Choirgirl Hotel"", Tori's fourth album, can be considered as an abrupt departure from her previous works. It is ! Although the piano is still present, Tori included other instruments which are far more present in this work : guitars, ""sillies"" on ""Raspberry Swirl"", bass, cellos... What an amazing piece of work. My favourite song is ""Hotel"" : a violent but luminous song, just listen to Tori screaming desperately on the chorus part, while the intensity and rhythm of music come to a climax. This song is... very good, I can't find the words, Tori is torn between rage (""Hotel"", ""Cocaine"") and melancholy (""Black Dove"", ""Playboy Mummy""), uptempo rhythm (""Raspberry Swirl"") and sweet ballads (""Northern Lad"", ""Jackie's Strength""). Well, a great album, very dark, violent and passionate. Tori keeps on leaving the listeners amazed by such diversified and beautiful songs. Just go for it !"
5,The Changing sound of Tori,"Tori Amos' music changes from album to album. In very subtle ways usually. If you compare This album with 'Little Earthquakes"" One can see just how much her sound has changed. This album has more dance and industrial sounds than her previous albums. As a fan of industrial music it totally worked for me. I don't have a favorite Tori Amos album, but this one usually get the most listens from me."
4,A truly yummy creation from tori and the girls.,i wasn't too keen on the whole plugged thought until i heard the cd. tori always seems to be in just the right place at the right time. cruel and northern lad are devastatingly beautiful
5,it's all good...,"tori amos never falls short of expectations. since boys for pele, i have been waiting for a new album that would blow me off my feet. from the choirgirl hotel does this. i am so appreciative of the intimate approach that tori takes to her music. she transcends it as not only a commodity in the eyes of the industry but breathes new life into it through her interesting new approach and views on religion, relationships, and sex. i have yet to hear a contemporary artist that can match or exceed the standard that tori amos has set for female artists today. as a devoted ear with feet, i have nothing but respect for her and her art. i hope that from the choirgirl hotel is not the last album by this provocative and prolific artist. i highly recommend it even if your music tastes differ."
5,it's all good...,"tori amos never falls short of expectations. since boys for pele, i have been waiting for a new album that would blow me off my feet. from the choirgirl hotel does this. i am so appreciative to the intimate approach that tori takes to her music. she transcends it as not only a commodity in the eyes of tehe industry but breathes new life into it through her interesting new approach and views on religion, relationships, and sex. i have yet to hear a contemporary artist that can match or exceed the standard that tori amos has set for female artists today. as a devoted ear with feet, i have nothing but respect for her and her art. i hope that from the choirgirl hotel is not the last album by this provocative and prolific artist. i highly recommend it even if your music tastes differ."
5,It gave me goosebumps,"I borrowed this cd frow my brother's girlfriend, not really knowing what to expect, but after hearing it once it was automatically one of my favorite albums. the songs were darker than some of her others, but i didn't feel it was as depressing as some reviewers labeled it. i loved jackie's strength and she's your cocaine, but all of the songs are great. it's really, really worth buying."
2,SHE'S BETTER W/OUT THE BAND,"I have been a Tori Follower for years so I exprcted this to be just as good as her previous Albums, Boy was I disapointed!! The added band and techno crap took away from what Tori is really all about. She is sooo much better with out the extra noise drownding her out. I hope for her sake she returns solo. She's a beutiful artist and This album did not do her justice."
2,"Tori, what went wrong????","I loved Tori Amos from the first time I heard her music. I have all her albums and four of her EPs and have seen her in concert three times. So why don't I like THIS album? Well, Tori seems to have disappeared behind the band. I like Black Dove, but that is about it. My biggest criticism is that most of the songs are gasp forgettable; I'm not used to that with Tori... Yes, there is Raspberry Swirl -- I like the tune, but PLEASE! leave the orgasms off the album! Tacky, tacky, tacky... I don't know if I will buy her next album -- that's how much of a disappointment this one was."
2,"The devil's advocate, your honour...","Yes, among all these reviews rating the CD as 5 stars I feel much like playing the role of the devil's advocate here.Anyway, the fact is that after listening to other work by Tori, From the Choirgirl Hotel is a deception. Don't expect the same piano & voice stuff as in Little Earthquakes, like I did or you'll end up throwing this CD out through the window, like I almost did, if it wasn't for this one great song (which saves the CD)... and that is Spark. Ok, so Tori is still, in this CD, powerful with the lyrics and all that, but the melody isn't half as good as in Little Earthquakes, which is definetely a must buy."
2,"Better Than Her Previous Effort, But...","Upon first listen, this album intrigued me. First of all, much more effort had gone into its writing and recording than Tori's 1996 effort, the starkly solitary, rambling, badly-sung ""Boys For Pele."" Most of the songs had at least one pleasing melodic idea. However, with each listen I grew more disenchanted with the work. With the exception of ""Spark"" and ""Jackie's Strength,"" not one of the songs improved with age. After I got over the initial, superficial appeal of the Arabic glint of ""i i i i e e"", for instance, I found that it was compositionally lacking. She had an idea but failed to capitalize on its potential, opting instead for noisy samples, sloppy and shoddy guitar work and oppressive bass. It's really a pity Amos abandoned her true calling, the so-called ""mock symphonic"" arrangements which gave such subtle power to her 1991 debut which remains her best and most lasting creative work."
3,Not bad but not the second coming either.,"Except for the lyrics, this is mainly a modern rock/pop album. There is nothing daring or out of left field about the music. It's very relaxing to listen to and the words are easily ignored unless you are really concentrating on trying to understand her gibberish. Ms. Amos's voice is strictly average but at least it isn't offensive to listen to. I say buy it."
1,My least favorite Tori album,"I have been a fan of Tori Amos since ""Little Earthquakes"", and I purchase every new CD within days of its release. ""Choirgirl Hotel"" is without question my least favorite Tori Amos CD. I hate the CD so much it is the only CD from her that I will not play any more. I have not listened to this CD in 10 years. When my playlist plays a song from this CD I do not hesitate to skip the song. I am shocked that so many people gave this CD a positive review."
5,"""I guess you go too far when pianos try to be guitars...""","From the choirgirl hotel is Tori's best and most personal album. All her albums are great but choirgirl is just so gorgeous and haunting. Spark is booming with intoxicating energy, Northern Lad is layered in extreme lovliness, and Jackie's Strength is my favorite song of the collection, lyrics like, ""you're only popular with anorexia so i turn myself inside out in hope somone would see."" The music before the chorus is incredible and it still gives me chills. Playboy Mommy is so sad and personal, you feel almost guilty listening to such a real and heartwrenching song. She's your cocaine is dripped in unrequited ecstasy the line, ""And isn't true that devils end up like you, something safe for the picture frame."" Tori knows what the heck she is doing. Choirgirl is a stunning achievement from the goddess of weird."
2,Please get rid of that band!,"A few months ago I listened to this CD at the store, and for the first time ever - I walked away terribly dissapointed in a Tori Amos CD. Three weeks ago I picked up a single that does have Spark on it - and it has grown on me some (that's why two stars, not one). But still I like Tori's music *so* much better when it's just her and a piano. I really hope that that Tori isn't gone for good."
2,oh dear......,"....was the reaction of my fellow tori fan and I as we listened to this album. Not enough sweet piano and beautiful melodies, and a song which begins, ""let's go!"" is always a bad sign, especially for an accomplished artiste like Tori Amos. Bring back Little Earthquakes and quirky Bee-Sides any day!"
2,real let down..,"This is the worse Tori Amos Cd that I`ve known of so far. It was a real let down and it seems as if tori forced this cd out, the lyrics are not tori like, and she plays hardly any piano on this, and when she does it`s over done with drum sounds and other annoying sounds, but if you`re a die hard tori fan you may enjoy it, but I didn`t."
2,Not gonna make me a fan...,"Well, this album was weird. I expected a less whiny version of tori, and what did i get? a still whiny tori who discovered techno!The cd is pretty boring except for the song Iieee, i see she's been listening to bjork, ALOT.Doesnt the opening to playboy mommy sound just like bjork's ""The Anchor Song""?Anyway, yes, shes still with that damn piano, and that mumbling of lyrics that shes known for. My point: IF you hate tori, this album wont change your mind."
1,"It must be so hard for you, Tori.","I'm so sorry that you are surrounded by horrible men that sign you to a major label, enable you to make millions of dollars, create the political freedom that allows you to be a spoiled brat in public, create the technology that is necessary for you to record in the first place. How do you deal with such blatant oppression?"
4,"Good, but not without its flaws","Ok, why am I writing this review? Because this was my first Tori Amos CD. Second, this is probably for new Toriphiles.This was also the album which changed my presumptions about electronic music. The vocals on Liquid Diamonds and Cruel are haunting, but on the whole I think Spark and Liquid Diamonds are the only flawless songs. If she toned down the dramatics on Northern Lad maybe I would have liked the song better. It seemed to me she was trying to do an aria on a rock album--tacky. Similar for Hotel--one of those songs I can never get into. Imagine the combination of bombastic electronic sounds with a howling soprano and mystifying lyrics. Anyway, my favourites on this record are Spark, Cruel, Black Dove, Liquid Diamonds, She's Your Coccaine and Pandora's Aquarium.Much as I respect Tori Amos deeply, I can't help telling the truth. As you can see, I'm not one of those TORI THE GODDESS RULES! fans. :)"
2,"Tori Amos, again, casts herself in the role of victim","In Rolling Stone last month she said that she knew she was anchovies...if she were potato chips she'd be more popular, but she can't help being anchovies. Well, this stinks! I liked ""Boys for Pele"" much better than this confused and conflicted group of tunes. She sang about triumph and pride! She was alone and calling the shots! Call the shots, girls! I am a Tori fan, but she piles up her life experiences in a way that is no longer ingratiating to the listener; I feel intruded upon, and I feel stressed when I hear this music. She need to work some of this out on her own...She has begun to view her life simply as material for her next record, which cannot be healthy. She needs to get back to the piano, and stop ""the engineers"" from ruining her next album. Tori needs to stop being a victim if she is ever going to make a good record again...(I give it two stars; 1 for the cover art, and 1 because I have been a fan of her past work...)"
2,Your Daily Dose of Blasphemy,"Consider this review your daily dosage of blasphemy. I know... Tori Amos is a minor diety. I know... she deserves to be immortalized. That said, this album is in no way the reason for that... it has some good songs... Spark is beautiful. Jackie's Strength rocks too. But... Raspberry Swirl? Cruel? WHY? WHY?In short, the album is overdone. The starkness and emotion running through her earlier albums are missing here, as the full band and electronic arrangements forcibly drown out the piano, which has always been her forte.It's not that the songs aren't emotional. At their best, they're still moving Tori songs. But the rest of the time... She's Your Cocaine? I mean... where's the image? Where's the brilliance? Where's the poetry Tori has mastered?On the whole, get Little Earthquakes."
4,From Pele to Choirgirl,"I think many fans misunderstood the quiet storm that was PELE in 1996. This is another venture into new musical ground, Tori who on CHOIRGIRL uses different elements of music such as beats and drum loops, and still using the piano, I think many fans felt she was giving up her roots, but truly listen to this album and try to understand it. ""Spark"" and ""Playboy Mommy"" both tragically tell the tale of her miscarriage of 1996, so beautifully written and sang with so much emotion. ""Cruel"","" Hotel, and ""Raspberry Swirl"" make good use of this new sound too. ""She's Your Cocaine"" and ""iiiee"" venture into the drug world. Overall this is a nice album, if you were disapointed with PELE give this a try I think you'll be surprised."
1,Degrading to Society,"I like the first two albums. That's where it ends. I saw her in Philadelphia in April 1998. Not only was audience a bunch of 14 year old girls, but the songs of this album (with the full band) were terrible compared to the older stuff. On top of that she spouted the ""f"" word one time too many. She believes all the hype about herself. Stay Away."
1,This album is an abomination to my ears.,"It's unfortunate that there aren't negative numbers, one is not low enough. What is the deal with Tori Amos? She is a talentless tool of the man. Her job in life is to unite all of you hairy-pitted, head shaven, manly women, behind a sound of flatulence. No one has produced this sort of abomination since Paula Cole."
1,"Tori may be the girl with the piano, but now she's more.","Being a Tori Fan since her first solo album ""Little Earthquakes"" I have collected her albums and singles since what seems the beginning of time. When ""The Choirgirl Hotel"" was relesed, I heard parts and I was confused. Was this the girl with her piano anymore? No. She's more than that now. Sure, it still has that Tori touch, but it doesn't seem to have the feeling in it anymore. Is this Y Kant Tori Read all over again? I will have to admit, I did listen to it for a while. They almost sound like her remix extras on her singles. Sure, they're a novelty, but after a while, you get sick of it. That is how I view this album. You listen to it, and then it will be like the rest of those CD's sitting on your rack. You can say you have it, but it will more than likely just collect dust."
5,modern music for a modern mind,"Tori has tripped us up again. This album seems to be the exact opposite of her last album. With BFP Tori gave us a concept album that was flawless as a vision but lacked a little technical skill that she sharply refined and pulled off beautifly with FTCH. This album is addictive in sound that BFP was in emotion and story. The stronger tracks on the album are the most experimental- Cruel, i i e e e, and Hotel which are flawless in lyric and music. It just seems that she is caught between two forms of music- her new stuff (girls you know what I mean-Hotel, Cruel) and her older stuff (Playboy Mommy, Northern Lad). The latter just sounding un-inspired and tired. Maybe she should have gone a little more head-on with her more experimental stuff and left the rest who want another girl/piano as one entity album in the dust. She is another Bowie always changing keeping her fans grasping for their breath the whole time."
3,Mediocre Album Does Not Shatter Faith,"Far from being her best album, ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" does contain a few songs that restore hope to the otherwise confused Tori Amos fan: ""Northern Lad"" and ""Playboy Mommy"", both buried deep in the sequencing, and to a lesser degree, ""Jackie's Strength"". ""Spark"" employs an odd time signature, but fails to live up to the expectations of an opening track. ""Raspberry Swirl"" is simply the worst Tori Amos song in existence. ""Pandora"" starts out awkwardly, but eventually moves to a tolerable chorus. Overall, not a good album by Tori standards, but showing enough of the beauty and complexity that draws her fans to her to keep them coming back the next time."
5,This ISN'T Lil' Earthquakes,"Yes, it's true that ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" isn't ""Little Earthquakes,"" and perhaps it is sad to some, but Tori's music has definately matured in a positive way since her first album. Reading through some of the articles about her, I gracefully stumbled to the fact that Tori wanted a a band of her own. She said that she rather be known with a band behind her name, than some studio digital effects. ""From the Choirgirl Hotel"" does has some originality also. Another word, her songs are still her lyrics...her words. This is a major milestone for Tori...and I still enjoy the CD."
3,Some good dance mixes,"I really liked the Peace Division mix but found the vocal to be uninspiring and I heard the same thing in the way that it was processed, ""there are bees all over my body"" and the vocal just didn't cut it for me. Some of the Superchumbo tracks were nicely mixed and harder edged. There was a diversity in the mixes and this is always helpful when DJing. This CD lacks daily listening pleasure as there just isn't enough content element."
1,Kane & Abel,"First, I'll preface this review in stating that I'm reviewing the abridged audio version of this book. I avoid abridged versions of any book, but this one was given me by a friend to read.As the story unfolded in the beginning it was quite interesting. After awhile though the story line became quite predictable. Consistancy was lacking in the leading characters. Their personalities and responses were modified to fit, what seemed to be, a greatly contrived and simplistic story line. After getting two-thirds through the book my interest was no longer in what happened to the characters, but whether my theories on what will happen was correct.Most people seemed to really like the book and again I can only relate to the heavily abridged CD version. I suspect that so much was chopped out of the story that the summary of events not told gave too many clues to future events. Stay away from abridgements because even if a story is good, they will most often disappoint!"
1,A SORRY TALE OF A CONFUSED AUTHOR: PLOT MISMATCH,"I have just finished reading kane&abel, i must confess that the author brings out delight in treating of the affluent class, as well as the final closing of the climax, the discovery of the real patorn of abel rosenoski was in my view flawed, It raises only question is that, if there was so much hatered and jealosy why the hell the willium kane would have to help the abel fisrthandedly and the hate him till his end. A very poor and dissopointing end to how ever a brilliantley told story. If the author had taken interest in developing of climax the story would be much better."
2,Audio Book Review,"As an avid devotee of audio books and a fan of Jeffrey Archer, I was really looking forward to this audio book.It was VERY disappointing. All I can think of to explain this is that it was only available as an abridged audio book, and the abridgement sucked the very soul and life out of this book.At best, it was a story stripped to the bare bones, with none of Archer's typical wit and style. It was told mostly by narration instead of creating scenes for the reader to experience the story. It had almost no dialogue, and what little there was was incredibly contrived and awkward. At least in this version, the characters were so one-dimensional and the plot was laid open so that you could guess the way the story would unfold almost from the very begining.If you are going to read this book and have any hope for enjoying it PLEASE do NOT get the abridged audio book!"
5,Epic Read!,"This is my second Archer novel and I must say I couldn't help devouring every single word. It was fantastic. After reading ""Paths of Glory"", I was determined to seek out ""Kane and Abel"" and I wasn't disappointed. Archer is a great storyteller and his character development is superb. He even had me fooled. And unlike other books I've read recently, the story was satisfactorily resolved. You won't be disappointed."
5,Great book!,"This is my favorite book of all times. I've read it about 5 or 6 times in the last 10 years and I enjoy it every time. A great story of two men being born under very different cirmustances and how their lives interwine throughout the book. The sequel, The Prodigial Daughter, is excellent as well."
5,Best book I have ever read!,"this is by far the best book I have ever read. the book has absolutely everything in it....good vs. evil, rags to riches, politics, war, inspiration, redemption.story could have happened today, and it was set over 70 years ago.I highly recommend!Michael AxelrodShort Hills, NJ"
3,Great first draft,"The book is poorly written. The kind of novel that today could only be published through some third-rate POD company.It is way too long, and all Mr. Archer does, throughout most of the book, is tell, tell, tell. It's all one long third-person omniscient narrative.That said, the beginning was well done. I really cared about Abel. Until he went to the US and suddenly became boring, shallow, and spiteful.The plot is improbable to the point of being ridiculous.So why three stars? Because despite all its shortcomings, I still found myself wanting to know what happens next."
4,"strong start, weak finish","the first three-quarters of the book were fantastic. the last quarter, the book seems to fall apart with predictable plot twists and never ending cliches. nevertheless, the book is a fun read."
5,Incredible Story! Must Read!,"This book was a total fluke. I was stranded at my older brothers cottage and found this no frills book at the laundry mat. I decided I needed something to pass the time, and ended up finding one of my favourite books of all time. Archer is absolutely incredible and his story telling is astonishing. What a tangled web or wonderful magic. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant I say. Rarely do I remember a book after I'm done, and yet I will never forget this one."
2,What is the theme?,"I purchased this book based on the review by a journalist who I admire and was disappointed after forcing myself to finish reading it. I told myself not to read another book by the same author and downgraded my admiration for that journalist who recommended this author.First I cannot identify the theme of the novel. It is boring to be just 'told"" a whole bunch of easily predicted incidents without evoking any deeper feelings on the way. There is no deep character development whatsoever. I feel like watching ""soap opera"" most of the time. The ending climax is too easy to predict and I lost interest half way through the book.Second the style of writing is blunt which is not my taste for literature.However I did found Abel's early life adventure able to hold my interest and I gained some knowledge of Poland's history during WW1."
4,Kane & Abel,"This book held my attention from beginning to end. Could hardly wait to finish it and get onto the next in the series ""Prodigal Daughter"". Wonderful reading, would high recommend this series!"
3,A bit disappointing,"Well written like all of his novels. I was very interested and involved with the characters. The characters are well developed, the story lines grew as we followed their lives. Then they became very un-likeable. These successful and driven men began to act out of character in my opinion.The ending was very disappointing and as a result I cannot recommend the book. Great story telling, and then a real let down."
5,Great author,"This was my introduction to Jeffrey Archer. A client had jokingly asked if I had ever read the ""Kane & Abel"" story and I laughed, assuming he was using the standard Biblical reference that I had heard all of my life. One day, I happened across the title and was hooked.Jeffrey Archer is an incredible author who has the ability to weave a tale that pulls you in completely. He writes the works that renders you sleepless...I found myself pulling myself back out of bed at night just to read through this one in one day.If you haven't read Jeffrey Archer, this is a great start!"
5,A must read book,A well written book. Highly recommendable. Can't wait to get my hands on the coming Clifton Cronicle book no. 3.by Jeffrey Archer
5,All Time Favorite,"The first time I read Kane & Abel, I was a teenager in highschool. Now that I have a teenager in highschool, I find it amazing I still consider this to be one of my top 5 favorite books. Several other reviewers have given a synopsis of the story, so I'll not duplicate their efforts. All I want to do is encourage you to read it. Jeffery Archer definitely knows how to write an epic that hooks the reader with the first line of the book. The exciting thing is that it continues to hook the reader until the very last line (which I would not recommend reading until you have read all the pages in between.)"
3,No surprise in this book,Yes I finished it but not great experience. No waw factor. I liked because I am also an hotelier but little bit boring. Regards.
3,Epic saga,It's a good and fast read despite the length of the book. Would be a great movie. Easy plot lines...your classic tale of two men going after one another. Which is the good guy and which is the bad one? Hard to say really. It's a good summer or vacation reading companion.
4,Great!,I found the novel very well written. It's a real page-turner!Of course it's not a very profound story but it keeps you interested until the very last page.
5,A timeless epic spanning decades,"A brilliant piece of work. Like a fellow reviewer, I too was just 15 when I first read ""Kane and Abel"". Archer's easy style and clear, concise story telling make all his works enjoyable to read, but this had an edge to it quite like nothing I have ever seen again. A masterpiece."
2,Not so impressive,"Several of my coworkers read this book recently, so I thought why not, I'll read it too. I have to say that I was very unimpressed. My biggest problem is that I found the story line way too predictable. It was very obvious that certain things were going to happen and that the author was setting the stage. It has a few small surprises, but overall, not very impressive. Maybe my hopes were too high. Nevertheless, I don't intend to read any other novels by the author."
5,one of the best fiction books i have ever read,"narration moves beatifully, the author keeps you interested throughout the book, leaving cliffhangers all over that keep you wanting to read more and faster so that you can finish this masterpeice."
4,Predictable Always,Overall the book is interesting. Yet I felt that the story hardly had any surprises. I could more or less always predict the chain of events that would form the story line. This is the only book I have read by this author and this is supposed to be one of his great works. I wonder how amateur his other plots might be.
3,Its okay about sums it up,"It was quite a good story and I never considered not finishing, BUT the previous Jeffrey Archer book I had just finished prior to this one (A Prisoner at Birth) was so fantastic that this one just didn't measure up.This one dragged on a bit & didn't keep me up at night wanting to know what happened next which is always my measure for a great read versus an okay read."
3,Very Good Read,I thoroughly enjoy Jeffrey Archer as an author. I am now reading the Prodical Daughter which is somewhat of a sequal to Kane and Able. Very good reading to say the least!
5,Best so far!,"Kane & Abel is the best Novel that I have read so far. I recommend it as ""A Must Read"" for everyone. This Novel not only nicely depicts the story and characters of two person born in different environment across the globe, it also gives an opportunity to relate it to our real life. It makes one to re define his or her's priorities, and to figure out as what is the most important thing in one's life.""Kane & Abel"" is a collectible forever, you can read it again and again from anywhere, anytime. And you will find it more and more interesting, like the first time, everytime......"
3,Does what it says on the box,"It's a good book to take on holiday. If you're picking this up at the airport, it will keep you entertained during your holiday, it is very, very basic, character-wise, so there will be no need to go back and re-read when picking it up again. In fact, it probably benefits from just a bit of forgetfulness, considering the characters seem to forget themselves what they have done before - like eating at the embassy a thousand million times."
4,Very pleasant read,"I enjoyed this book very much. Love conquers all, and grudges are wasted energy, make the most of your life."
4,Each track stands on it's own.,"This album should be looked at as collection of tracks that would be best listened to by their lonesome than as a pack, which is a problem because the majority of the record buying public likes to hear an artist's album that flows in some sort of manner. I found that by throwing these songs in a mixtape that they wonderfully contrasted the other material, and at times turned out to be among the favorite songs for my friends.I can agree that others may find this music messy and/or uninspired if taken in as a whole (even though the thing is only like a half hour), but try to peep them as singles and hopefully you'll dig it more."
2,Good production/Boring Album,"I've loved nearly every record Mitchell Froom produced (Crowded House, Suzanne Vega, Latin Playboys, etc.), but this album is a disappointment. It just wasn't very catchy or cohesive. If you want to hear Froom at his best, buy Suzanne Vega's ""Nine Objects of Desire"" or anything by Crowded House."
3,not bad,"i really like the textures and flava. but the guest vocalists can be quite annoying. Froom may want to listen to some Astor Piazolla if he wants to pick up some dope authentic dark evil slow latin grooves.if you want a more cohesive choice, pick up some of the recent tom waits cds. or maybe nick caves first two solo cds. or some barry adamson or prince charmings first cd."
1,disapointment,This cd is a big disapointment. Mitchell is a talented producer but this cd lacks intensity. I personally feel the only 2 good songs are Wave by Cibo Matto's Miho Hatori and Suzanne Vega's Dopmine. Hopefully Mitchell will stick to producing others music and not his own!
1,Aweful,"Why is the worst album Mitchell Froom has made the only one available? He should have re-released the classic ""Key of Cool"" album on CD."
2,not quite there,"this is a sort of depressing record, not because it's bad, but because it makes abundantly clear that good ears and reasonable ideas are not enough to make a great record... it's full of cleverness, and quite interesting, but it's not actually satisfying."
1,No Stars - Who Cares?,I agree with Mrs. Norman Main's review and really couldn't have stated it better. Narcissistic drivel. Ms. Jong is just not as interesting as she thinks she is.
3,A nice collective of available cigars,"A nice collective of available cigars (at time of publication) but would love to see the offering expand to include the manufacturer, picture of band and possible notes of strength albeit could be subjective."
5,Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars,This is a really nice book to help people learn about cigars. There are lots of really neat details not found in other cigar books. A lot of history. Thought it was a real find.Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars 2008 edition
4,Some good info,This book has proved somewhat helpful. Especially when looking for specifics. Would buy again.
2,Nothing more than a list.,"This book contains a very complete list of virtually any widely distributed cigar maker in the market. It lists the manufacturer as well as all of the sizes produced. If all you are looking for is a quick reference for cigar brands and the sizes they are available in, then buy this book.However, if you are looking for discriptions of taste, or recomendations, then you will need to go elsewhere. A sentence or two of description is about all you can hope to find here. The majority of these run along the lines of ""Cigar A is good, well made, cigar manufactured in Country B.""As I mentioned above, if you're looking for a list of cigars there's no better source. But if you're looking for any kind of depth, substance, or recommendations you will need to look elsewhere."
2,Missing Link - No band pictures.,"I expected the cyclopedia to include pictures of the cigar bands. It doesn't. Without a rosetta stone to correlate the listing in the cyclopedia to the actual cigar, it's pretty usless to me.The info listed; shape, name, length, ring, and wrapper; can already be found any number of places on the Net."
2,No real added value,"Perelman's Pocket cyclopedia doesn't rate cigars, it's only a list of all non-cuban brands and their size, so don't plan any buys in Cuba with this book. This book is also of a small size (pocket size) as well as his font size which makes it quite difficult to read."
4,Good for informative purposes,"This is not a how-to book. Nor is it a review book. It simply tells you the sizes of every cigar in production at the time the book was released. From that view point, it is helpful to people in the business, or people who want to use it as a reference guide (sort of like a cigar dictionary). If you're looking to learn about cigar smoking, then I would not recommend this book, but rather one of the ""cigar smoking for dummies"" books or a an internet resource."
3,Perelman's Cigar Book,"More photographs would have been helpful. Pictures of the entire line of each brand, with a close-up of one band, would have been much more useful than much of the text.The proliferation of commercial ads brings the integrity of already subjective commentary into question. Objective information, such as country of origin, is much more useful overall.All that being said, the book has it's uses, and was a fair value at the purchase price."
5,Reading this author is as if you're watching a movie!,Nobody in a long time has written so obviously with the reader in mind. Each character and scene creates an incredible sequence of events. Simpson is definitely unique as a storyteller.Highly recommended reading.
3,"Mostly excellent track selection, but somehow lacks soul","This mix contains some excellent tracks in the hard house, chicago house genres, and a few cheesey ones that should have been left in the bargain crate at the record store. The mix is flawless, and I think that's part of the problem. It's obviously done in a studio and it just lacks soul. Even though I like many of the tracks and the overall build of the CD I just don't have much desire to listen to it again and again. Contrast this with some other CD's that have similar sounds like Donald Glaude on the mixer series, and maybe the second Subversion CD from Glasgows incredible Sub Club, that are basically recorded live or in the DJ's bedroom and BBB just doesn't stack up."
4,"Great CD, weak DVD","OK, I know house music (and most dance music) is supposed to be catchy and poppy though i would hardly call it ""popular"" (i.e. when's the last time you had a chart topping mix album in the US?)Anyway, what is contained on here is awesome, i don't know these songs, but I like em. BBB is at peak hour perfection, and he mixes in a way that is not boring. I like mixes that are constantly changing (like Shadow and Cut Chemist's Brain Freeze).That being said, the DVD is weak. The video-mix is decent, it would work well as an alternative to just throwing the CD on at a party. But the ""extras""- the stuff that would take the audience BEHIND THE DECKS is worthless. Bill seems cool and interesting enough, but it's a bunch of handycam videos of Bill's hanger-on posse goofing around. There's no incsight into the mixing process, the creative process or any element of production. Instead we're treated to a bunch of idiots goofing around and traveling with a phenomenal DJ."
2,what????,"why do people like this album?? every other one that he has ever made is awesome but this one... he even says on the dvd himself,""this has got to be the worst album, hopefully people will buy it."" well i did, and i'm very unhappy with it.."
4,Best one yet?,"I always look forward to Bills newest set. Probaly because he was the first dj I ever saw and will always be my favorite. Listened to the cd for the first time today. Must say, I am glad to see Bill returning to his true roots of staight up house music, with his own taste of the hard beats I've come to enjoy. Have all of his cd's and alot of lp's he has spinned for his sets. All in all, ths is a BANGIN cd, as only Badboy knows how to do it. Will be bangin with him one more time in Houston on Nov. 8, 03...Peace"
1,Not the usual Bill,"I don't know what it is, but this mix just sucks. Although the song selection seems a lot like BTB vol. 5, they just aren't the same. Something is missing but I can't explain it. I was waiting for this CD forever now, and the day I got it I listened to it for a few mins, skimmed through the songs more, but never liked a single part. His BTB series were MUCH better, especially volumes 1, 3, and 5. Something else I noticed is the fact that this isn't really hard house, it's funky house. Hopefully BBB will stick to something harder on his next CD. Perhaps House Connection 3?"
1,too many vocals!,"I love house music, but this CD is just way too over the top for me. The first few minutes is good, then the vocal barrage begins, a continuous onslaught of mediocre, and in most cases grating vocals. I know that Bad Boy Bill is more of a commercial radio DJ and not really a DJ who has roots in the rave scene, but this is even too much vocal lameness for your local power hour workout radio DJ. Kind of like Planet Soul times 100, if you can imagine that. If you love freestyle music, then you might like this CD, but if you are looking for something with more of an underground sound, I would recommend picking up something else."
4,well made album and smooth vocals,"Toni has the pipes and has had a resurgence with her show with sisters and that is great as she is a great entertainer and performer...this album is smooth, shows her voice."
4,More sad love songs,"I don't know about anyone else but I simply love these songs. Toni Braxton really has something here - the songs have both good ,danceable beats plus songs that will break your heart. I gfind myself listening to this CD several times a day! I know most of the words to most songs as you would ANY good CD!"
3,Gotta Love Her Voice!,"Toni Braxton has one of the most distinctive voices in the industry. You can't help but caught up in the deep richness of her range. However, I don't think that ""Secrets"" was her best effort. The CD is filled with good songs, but I wish she could have had less ballads. Of course, I can't talk about this album without mentioning Braxton's signature hit, ""Un-Break My Heart."" This is the song that put her on the map and made her a star. She really did the song and Diane Warren (the writer) justice.Stand-out track: ""Talking in His Sleep"" - it's a nice departure from the normal love song.Overall, this a pretty good CD, but I know that there is so much more that could be done to showcase Braxton's voice."
3,Toni's breakthrough album.,"Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career. This album is pretty good but it's also a mixed bag as well. After a thousand listens to, Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating! You're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever, love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton. The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I can't understand what she is singing, she needs to enuicate her words. This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that's pretty much it."
2,WARNING Flat Beats May Kill,"In fact its not just the beats that kill you it can be her voice. Don't get me wrong she can sing but she doesn't. I only like 2 songs ""Your Making Me High"" and ""Talking In His Sleep"". Even though she talks mostly on ""Talking In HIs Sleep"" she really sings on it too, and I like her voice. This CD can put you to sleep cause there are no party songs that make you want to dance. ""Your Making Me High"" is a nice song but its not really dancy. Everything doesn't have to be dancy but her SINGING on a dance track would be awsome."
1,bad. period.,"i have nuthin against toni or her fans, just all that sappy mush. for example, unbreak my heart...what on earth does unbreak mean? it isnt even in the dictionary! see what i mean?"
1,Repugnant,"Actually, I really liked Braxton's first album. I was really looking forward to this release and went out to purchase it right away. Half way through this CD, I was bored to tears. Braxton is a tired, wanna-be R&B diva with limited vocal ability. The songs on this CD are whack! And her vocal performance is even worse. No matter how hard she tries, she will never be in the same category as legends like Aretha, Chaka, Tina and Patti. I can't even put her in the same category as Whitney, Mariah or even Sade. Toni mainly gets by on her looks, because she certainly possess very little talent, which she clearly goes out of her way to prove on this dissappointing CD."
2,Overrated!,"To me, Toni Braxton is one of the most overrated singers of the 90s, and this album is far worse than it's reputation. Nice voice but sterility in sound and expression, having left me with an uncomfortable aftertaste of too much sugar. Soul is music that moves your heart, and this collection of songs is definitely not soul! Better listen to real soul divas like Regina Belle, Phyllis Hyman, Candi Staton, Angela Bofill and the likes!"
5,NICE,"I've read the reviews, and no one mentions the cut on the album Secrets, ""Why Should I Care For You"". On this single, Babyface plays three different Guitars, opening with an acoustic guitar lead reminescent of the Isley Brothers' classic guitar solos.Toni then weaves a spirited, yet sad song about how her former lover wants to come back to her, but she asks the question constantly, ""Why should I care?""Listen to this one, and I guarantee, you will become addicted to it, especially the sequence that goes: Back in the day, when I was young, I wasn't afraid to love. Back in the day, you were the one, what was I thinking of. Back in the day, I should have been wiser, I should have been on to you. But I was afraid, I'd make a mistake, no one knows....Tell me why (why should I care for you).After listening to this cut the first time, you will then be able to answer the question."
3,OK album.,"This is a half-and-half deal. This has Toni Braxton's very well-known and famous song, Unbreak my heart. However, besides that song, none of the other songs on the album are any interesting or that good, though. So buy it if you want to, but I'm warning you in advance."
4,Oops Toni did it again.,"Another jammin release from Miss Toni. I heard this cd after the fact but it still translates into a good album (although I wish there were more up tempo songs on it). My faves are ""Come On Over Here"", ""Talking In His Sleep"", and ""In The Late Of Night"". This is a good, romantic cd to play in the background for ambiance."
5,"Babyface, once again=MIDAS touch","This is Toni at her best. Forget More than A Woman and that other cd. If you want true Toni Braxton, you need to check out Secrets and the self-titled debut Toni Braxton.Fave Tracks2. You're Makin' Me High 10/103. There's No Me Without You 9/104. Un-Break My Heart 11/106. How Could an Angel Break My Heart 10/108. Let It Flow 10/10"
4,Can you unleash a secret?,"If you can...tell anyone you know about this CD!Toni has outdone herself: most of the tracks produced by Babyface (including the Summer 1996 # 1 hit YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH), but with support from David Foster (UN-BREAK MY HEART, written by Diane Warren and one of the best selling singles ever...), R. Kelly (I DON'T WANT TO), Soulshock & Carlin (I LOVE ME SOME HIM, extra nice tune to me...) and Toni Rich Project (COME ON OVER HERE).Add some studio help from Keny G. and a soundtrack tune (LET IT FLOW, from WAITING TO EXHALE), and the 3 bonus remixes of all of the singles off the CD - including the dancefloor anthem for UN-BREAK MY HEART...You will come up with one of the best R'n'B albums ever"
4,Secrets is the Perfect Follow-Up,"Toni Braxton waited 3 years to release her sophomore effort, Secrets, which follows the same formula as its predecessor while managing to sound fresh and new. The big ballad ""Un-break My Heart"" is the obvious smash hit, but other classics include the sultry ""You're Makin' Me High"" and the relaxing ""Let it Flow."" Smooth album cuts like ""Why Should I Care"" and ""Come on Over Here"" ensure that the album moves with a soulful, slow-burn feel from beginning to end. Secrets is the rare sophomore album that outdoes the artist's debut. 4 Stars."
5,Perfect!,These towels are just what I wanted - thin and absorbent. No water left on the dishes with these! And the colors are bright and do not fade with use.
1,Tidy Cats had turned to c--p.,"I don't know what Tidy Cats has done to their formula but it was not a wise move. As stated by an earlier reviewer, the old formula would turn into nice balls and was a finer grain. My cats loved the stuff as did I. The new formulation makes giant clumps that now stick to the floor of the litter box and are almost impossible to properly clean out. You have to scrape, scrape, and scrape some more just to get the muddy residue off the bottom of the box and then you've got all these fine scrapings of urine that won't/can't be picked up by the scooper within the leftover litter.It used to be the blue and red caps were different but now they are pretty much the same. Tidy Cats has turned into Scoop Away.Now the new search begins. Purina...take the hint. Bring back the old formula."
1,"worst, smells really bad and barely clumps","Bought this by mistake. I like fresh step multi cat-no smell ,great clumps. The Tidy cats instant action had my whole apartment stinking like crazy. And there were barely any clumps-just a wet mud and grainy mixture. I bought this in the past and hated it then. I hope to never confuse my brands again. I was afraid the landlord would come by and kick my out. It smelled like the cats had peed everywhere."
2,"I'm not sure how you call this ""Clumpable""","I have to keep one litter box in a spare bedroom due to one cat being picked on by another. I LOVED Fresh Step, but I noticed in that room there was a recurring film of dust all over everything that smelled like the litter. I decided to try Tidy Cats to see if I had the same issue.There was less dust, but stuff does NOT clump well at all!It was all but impossible to scoop out the ""clumps"" without it breaking and falling into the clean litter. Who is giving this 4 stars is beyond me.BTW-I tried their ""Small Spaces"" brand. It does the same thing.I'm amazed anyone buys this.I'm now using ""Scoop Away"", and it scoops very well, but the dust is back.Sigh."
2,Won't clump as well anymore,"I had gone with this brand because after trying several others, it was the only one my cat would use. It worked fairly well for a while. The clumping action was decent, and it was not the most expensive litter out there. So both the feline and me were content. More recently though, I've noticed the clumping is not as good as it used to be. It tends to break up very easily, and sticks to the sides and floor of the box which is pretty disgusting. If you don't get the scooping action exactly right, the clump tends to to break up into smaller pieces, making scooping a nightmare.I'm disappointed with what this product has become, and have the unenviable task of finding another brand that can control odors, not track too much, and clump!"
1,Doesn't clump at all - what happend?,"I have used Tidy cat for years. Over the past few months it just hasn't been clumping at all. It makes the urine a sludgy mass that sticks to the litter box. It's nearly impossible to scrape off of the box and I am tired of having to work so hard to clean it up.Between the clumping issues and the ridiculous amount of packaging, I am done with this brand."
1,Something's gone wrong,"This used to be a good product. In the last year, something has changed with the way it clumps...it doesn't anymore. I am switching to a different brand."
1,"whoa, what happened?","This stuff used to be great, the best value for clumping litter on the market, especially if you bought it in the huge tubs. But in the last few months it seems like they've changed the formula and it doesn't clump anymore! The clumps fall apart if you touch them with the scoop. There's no point to buying clumping litter that doesn't clump. BAD MOVE, Tidy Cat!"
3,cheap plastic,"Although it looks decent and glossy, it feels like cheap plastic.I had a lot of trouble removing the metal slots in the rear when i tried to attach a PCI and PCI x16 card. One of them was too hard to remove. I almost bent the whole frame.Spend more if possible and get a better tower."
5,stay awhile,"stay awhile:i heard of steve on a dave koz radio program on a local channel. i got the cd today,and haven't stopped playing it since.my wife is coming around to this type of music,and steve closed the gap.stay awhile,is great,but the whole cd is greater.i hope steve does more,and that brian and dave continue to to give us more of steve cole."
5,"Every song is great, good hooks ,a good mix of slow & fast","This is one of the best sax cd's I've heard in along time.It has a mix of fast & slow songs & a mix of tenor, alto & soprano sax.Almost every song has a great hook that keeps the song on your mind. All of my friends went out & bought a cd after hearing mine."
2,Disappointed,The song for which I purchased the CD had background vocals that were not suppose to be in the recording. The original recording doesn't have the background vocals. It was not true to the original recording. I have no use of the CD now. I'd like a refund.
4,Jig rod,A great little ice rod. I would buy it again. Used it this past season and it did the job. Now my grandson has it.
5,Sound Card,good price for open box really good sound and software for it. Fits snug in my computer just like that installation is a snap really nice look on it
3,Not bad... but a big problem IF...,"I like this card. I would give it 4 or 5 stars if not for the fact that YOU CAN'T HOOK UP A MICROPHONE AND DIGITAL SPEAKERS AT THE SAME TIME! Using the digital out port means you can't have a microphone input or line-in input. Very inconvenient. Otherwise, I've been happy with this card. I suppose I should have gotten the next model up or I should get a good USB microphone. But for a $100+ sound card, you ought to be able to have digital speakers and a microphone hooked up at the same time."
1,No drivers,Card will not work with Vista x64 and 4+ Gigs of RAM. Creative has still not released drivers to address this. I highly recommend buying audio cards from a different vendor.
4,Great Sound Card!,This sound card really produces some great sound. Just be aware of the software that it installs. I upgraded the software from their website and it installed several items in my startup registry especially one called DLLML that was eating up CPU when it was running idle. It's not needed and I highly recommend disabling it.
5,Xtremely Good,"I had a Sound Blaster Audigy (first generation) and it worked well and I thought that the X-fi whould not be as great as everyone is saying it is but after my dad had trouble with his old Sound Blaster Live! I decided to buy the X-fi and give my dad my old Audigy.After installing it and trying it out I see now the reviews were not wrong, it is a great sounding card."
2,"compare to my sound blaster live, I give 2 star for it","the Digital out can only support 2 speakers.so..... after replace sound blaster live gamer with this JUNK, I have toreturn to my analog cable which I have not used for 3 years."
5,Spectacular,"I, too, am writing to cancel out the vote of the idiot-child who first rated this book. When Amazon deletes his comment and rating, maybe it will delete mine, too."
4,"Overall, great toy but....","the only thing I would change is the option to have an AC adaptor. Batteries don't last long and it takes 4 ""D"" batteries. I can see the cost for fun piling up.Also, this track would be great if you could buy more pieces to make longer tracks and if you could get other cars besides Doc and Lightning. The option to use regular cars that are not associated with the movie would make this set last well beyond the novely of the movie.But my kids love it for now. just hoping we'll get more than a few months worth of use out of it."
1,High Maintenance Track,"My two sons really liked this track at first. However, once the novelty wore off, it was rarely played even though we kept it in a prime location. It also requires continual cleaning just to get it to work. The cars / track do not function unless they are cleaned. Would not recommend."
1,Cute but flimsy,"I read negative reviews about the race set, but chose to ignore them. I wish I had listened! Although the toy was very cute, it was not sturdy at all. The track would not fit together correctly. The cars would go around the track a couple of times then stop for no apparent reason. Not a good value for the price. We ultimately sent it back."
2,"Cute toy, but it doesn't work well","Talk about high maintanence! After finally getting this assembled on Christmas Eve, I discovered that in order to make it work the track and bottom of the cars have to be sanded on a regular basis and the item only comes with a tiny 2 inch by 2 inch piece of sandpaper (which was promptly lost in the Christmas melee). My kids played with it Christmas morning and then took it apart due to its size (around 3 ft by 1.5 ft when assembled). Pieces are not sturdy and poorly made."
2,Disappointment for Christmas,I bought this set for my kids for Christmas and it was a major disappointment! The instructions show you can put together different shapes for the track course but just taking the track apart one time caused the pieces to break. The cars never ran smoothly on the track. I'm glad the other toys we gave them for Christmas worked better because this one has ended up in the trash already.
3,"A lot of fun, but needs an AC adapter","My son (3 years old) has a lot of fun with this track race, but it needs an AC adapter because the batteries don't last long and it takes 4 ""D"" batteries. The cost of the fun increases with the use of the batteries."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased the track for my Son for Christmas, out of the box one of the cars was very slow. Requires lots of work to keep the cars running. I'm not pleased."
4,Pretty good,We bought this for the Cars cars. We have a nicer track but the kids enjoyed the Cars movie. We bought this to add to their collection of slot cars. They are actually two of our better cars and get chosen for use most often. I can not comment about the track because we have not used it.
2,"Cute idea, poor quality","We were excited to have a slot car set, but this one has been tempermental since the day we set it up. Currently, it is not running at all and we have tried all of the maintenance suggestions. It is also a pretty high maintenance toy for a younger child. Good price, not so good quality."
4,Great value for the money!,"I bought this racetrack for my 3-year old grandson who loves the movie Cars. I felt was great value and many hours of fun for the money. A bit difficult for him to assemble, but with help we have loads of fun!"
4,great gift,I purchased this race car set for my nephew who has more than gotten my money's worth it.
3,"Nice toy for the price, my 3 yr old loves it","My daughter is in love with this movie so I thought Id get her this as part of her bday present and she just loves it. Pretty easy to put together and it has held up to her mild abuse of this toy, and i really like the 3 different speed settings so the cars dont fly off the track so easily.I wish i could find some other cars, instead of the DOC HUDSON toy that came with it, MATER, anyone?Thanks - Aaron"
3,Disney Cars Racing Set,I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. He and his dad play with it all the time. The only downfall is it runs on batteries which can get pretty expensive and the cars tend to slow down quickly. It would be much better if it were electric.
4,Almost 4 year old loves Cars!,My son loved getting this race track. The only thing that was disappointing was how fast it ate 2 D Batteries. The fun was regenerated a few days later when my husband came home with a power pack that plugged into the wall. The speed was tremendously different with the new power pack. Cars were flying off the track!
2,ANOTHER CHEAP DISNEY PRODUCT,I am really disappointed in this race set. It is so cheaply made that after a few uses it is bent and doesn't work.
4,Though culture or pacttical mental training by WW Atkinson,"A classic of insight, well explained. All of his work comes through as practical and useful. I gave 4 stars only because the wording is from another time and it takes a small adjustment."
2,No Value for Money,The only good point is1.) Good Color(I bought Brown) with good quality.But so are other cashmere scarfs certainly not worth more than $10. I bought it for around $20.
3,"Not bad, not great either...","Some great musians listed on the CD package which prompted me to buy but the music is only sometime great. Other tracks have no appeal at all - so watch out.This seems like one of those subjective albums though - people either love it, hate it - depending on the track. I'm over those noisey tracks - it's been done sooo many times these days by sooo many artists - it's just not amusing anymore. One thing is for sure - there is no ground-breaking stuff going on here.For ""ground-breaking"" stuff check out Guillermo E. Brown's ""Soul at the hands of the Machine."" That is a monumental achievement on many levels. As is Tim Berne's ""The Shell Game"" all from the same Thirsty Ear record label."
4,Coltrane meets Autechre,"Coltrane meets Autechre Sure thats a cliched and easy way to sum up this disc, but if you were thinking of buying this, thats how I would sell it to you.Is this the future of drum n bass or the future of jazz? Maybe it's the future of both. Not for the faint of heart but definitely worth the effort."
3,Instructions Not Clear,"The instructions do not clearly cover what all the ""adapters"" are for. I thought I had the right one - but it leaked. I made a modification to allow it to work, but then it didn't fit properly. Nothing a little duct tape couldn't fix, but clearer instructions would have helped me avoid the problem. Doe it work - yes."
4,Great replacement hose and gun,I connects to my original power washer without the need for an adaptor. Works just like the original one.Perfect low-cost solution to my disabled power washer.
4,Powerwasher Universal Pressure Gun and Hose.,It was an exact replacement for my Powerwasher 1700. My only complaint is why my original one had a hair line crack. The hose is better quality than the original and at a good price.
3,Good price if it fit Coleman Powerwasher,"I purchased it for a Coleman Powermate 2200T. Unfortunately, it did not work with the Coleman's wand. I ended up with a product from a local hardware chain for $50 with a wand included. It is a bit heavier duty as well."
4,A good product,"This proved to be compatible with my electric power washer, and so far it works fine. It appears to be solidly made, but only time will tell how well it holds up. For the time being at least, my old power washer has new life."
5,powerwasher replacement gun,"I lent my powerwasher to a friend and over the winter he stored it w/o draining the hose/gun and naturally, it froze. When I got it back in the spring and went to wash my deck, the gun leaked badly. I bought the Powerwasher 80012 Universal Pressure Washer Replacement Gun and Hose and it fits and works like the original one when it was new. I'm very happy with the product."
1,Plastic connectors break,"Lasted 5 minutes, both the connector that came with this and the one that came with the tip both broke. Plastic not make for anything over 1,000 PSI."
3,Not that I don't like its not the right one for me.,When I making my order for a husky 2700psi power wash replacement hose this item came up it said universal thought this was perfect until I received my order nothing fit. Today it remains in the same amazon box have not decide what to do with it. I just have no use for it and still need a hose to fit my husky power wash.
1,Was not compatible,"I found that this was not compatible with my pressure washer. Unfortunately I didn't have time to try it out before the return time. Now I am stuck with a ""universal"" replacement gun and hose that either does not function properly or isn't compatible not sure which."
4,works great,"no leaks after first use, unlike original that came with home depot power washer. The attachments/adapters were not needed to work properly."
2,Not enough PSI to be universal,"Ill have to use this as a backup . Its just 2000 psi Most power washers today are 2700 and up . The price is ok and if your running Two Guns it will work But, Don't hook it to anything with Power .Wish they would have Been truthful about the product Just not telling you the PSI just makes it a lie of admission ."
5,power washer replacement gun and hose,This was exactly the item I was looking for and price was excellent. Power washer is working great again! I highly recommend this if you need a replacement.
1,Just give up on cheap pressure washers,"Hose worked about 4 times then it started leaking, i took the hose off an noticed that the o-ring had a tear in it already. save your money and use a professional pressure washer not one of the millions of cheap ones"
5,Fit my Husky H1600,"I was concerned by some of the reviews that it wasn't truly universal, but I took a chance and it fit my Husky H1600 perfectly."
1,Not Happy,"The Gun and hose itself not too bad ,but the connections for the accessories are terrible, they leak badly,everything made of cheap plastic, no sealing quality, got more water on my clothes ,than came out of the end of the nozzle"
1,lied,It said that this was a universal FAIP replacemnet gun and hose. Of course it did not fit m FAIP power washer. Waste of money
2,powerwasher hose,"This product was bought by mistake. After I looked at it, I'm glad I took the UPS hit and returned it."
1,item misrepresented,"FAIP PowerWasher Replacement Gun and Hose #80012I have a Powerwasher unit, so logically assumed this would work to replace a leaking hose. Wrong! I called Powerwasher. They said 80012 is not a part number they use. This apparently was made by somebody else and is thus misrepresented on the Amazon web site. The problem? The connection on the hose is a different diameter than on my Powerwasher unit."
5,Exceeded expectations.,"I purchased this to replace the original hose and gun which had begun to leak profusely on my aging Black & Decker PW1600 (1250 psi). Attaching the new hose to the pressure washer was simply a matter of screwing off the old hose connecter and screwing on the new. (At the time that I ordered, I was somewhat concerned that the old/new connecters might be different sizes, but that wasn't the case.) Also, my existing Black & Decker nozzles fit the new gun perfectly without having to use any of the adapters included.In my opinion, the new replacement gun/hose is easier to hold and use than the original and I think that it may actually improve cleaning marginally due to perhaps allowing a slightly different quantity of water to pass through the gun. It seems to me the overall quality is at least equal to and likely better than the original. But, all of that is, of course, subjective."
3,The good and the bad,The good is that it connected directly to my Task Force 1600 without the need for any adapters. Basically plug and go. The bad is that it began leaking immediately where the hose connects to the gun. I took it apart and found that an O-ring was missing from the gun where it connects to the brass connector on the hose. Fortunately this gun is identical to my old one so I recovered the O-ring from the old one and put it into the new one. After that it worked perfectly. Not too impressed with their quality control so now I'll be curious to see how long the gun lasts.
2,Great for 1 year,"Pruchased this hose exactly 13 months ago. Worked great with my pressure washer up until yesturday when the hose seperated from the gun. It looks like it cannot be repaired. So, either buy ANOTHER hose or a new pressure washer...I think I will go with a new pressure washer this time around. It had 5 stars in my book, but after breaking with little use and stored well, I can't say so much for long term reliability so I gave it 2 stars."
4,It worked!,"The universal powerwasher replacement gun worked just fine on my unit. I would have given it five stars, but the product was not packaged properly. One of the adapters (did not need anyways) was delivered broken."
4,Pressure gun,Replacement was better than original even though it looked exactly like the original.New one swiveled at the high pressure attachment on the gun + .Hose was 5' shorter than original - 20' vs 25' - .Fits Husky S2000 perfectly.
1,Wrong item received,"I ordered this item, the FAIP PowerWasher Universal Replacement Gun and Hose Kit #81K053SH but instead I got this,Powerwasher 1/4-Inch by 25-Foot Universal Extension Hose for Pressure Washers #EXT102F1SH. I requested a replacement hoping Amazon would see the error but still amazon sent the same WRONG item. I got fed up so I requested a refund instead. I just hope they won't refund to the WRONG credit card. BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN ORDERING THIS ITEM:FAIP PowerWasher Universal Replacement Gun and Hose Kit #81K053SH."
4,Pretty sweet cooler!,"The only reason this cooler is getting 4 stars instead of 5 from me is because the wheels broke off on the bottom. However, my boyfriend (whom I gave it to) abused the crap out of this cooler, he loaded it down super heavy and drug it over really rough concrete and gravel. I think if you don't push it to the very limit it would last just fine. It doesn't leak (my boyfriend still uses it, just carries it with the backpack straps), and if the bottom was made of a little tougher plastic or something else slightly more durable it would definitely get 5 stars from me."
1,Poor design will leave you angry,"There are some design flaws with this model. It works beautifully for the first couple dozen staples, but then the parts wear out and it will no longer function. Save your $10-$20 and get something else."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Don't be lured in by the premise of this film or it's pretty dvd cover.There is nothing artistic about this movie. It is cliche, silly, and not at all frightening. Everything about it screams awful, low budget, softcore adult film: the acting, wardrobe, cinematography, effects, lackluster romance, and most of all--forced plot.Normally, I can sit through a B or C grade horror flick for solely the entertainment aspect, but this movie was just unbearable. It seems to sacrifice the entertainment aspect in an attempt to be ""artsy,"" yet it comes off as mediocre as the main character's paintings.If you are interested in a thought-provoking and beautifully rendered vampire film, invest your time in something else, particularily ""Let the Right One In."""
3,Wasn't that bad...,"... it wasn't gory, wasn't high special effect or even dramatic. However, it wasn't as bad as I had heard. It was pretty unique and that's about all I can say without giving it away. Once you put aside your hardcore Hollywood expectations you will actually see the movie for what it is worth."
2,... No.,"I like seeing new takes on vampirism. As far as plot went, this had a rather promising premise and a interesting story. This movie was also intended to be artsy and stuff like that. But it ended up being weird, with a contrived script and really bad acting (along with embarrassing sex scenes) make this a movie that was tedious to sit through. The piranha-mouth thing was also a turn off, and the vampire makeup was... horrible.Overall, this movie had a great premise, which was ruined by horrid acting and a contrived script."
2,Lame Vampire Flicks,"I got this 4 DVD set for 5 bucks at a local Wal Mart. Overall, I thought all four flicks were lame, but worth seeing once or twice. I wouldn't recommend it. Dracula's Guest, especually has a pretty generic looking vampire."
4,movie isn't what other reviews are about. BACK LIES!!!!!,"it isn't really what the back says. its about a girl who tuns into a monster and she goes into a different ""world"" or whatever. she has friends that she lives with and turns one of them into one. the one who created her come back later. there is no sexuality or nudity in it except that the chick is an artist and she paints half naked paintings. nothing too terrible. oveall it was good but not what you might have expected."
5,Representing ATL with a concouis approach,This is a CD I'll fight you for. No one borrows it nor does it leave my house without me. All tracks have a message that's forced in your brain with every tight beat that is delivered. Dungeon Family hasn't till this day released a wack artist. Outkast deliverd the first punch and Goodie Mob followed up with sharp body blows with this one. Your completely late and lost if this one isn't in your collection by now.oNe
5,Do I smell......REAL HIP-HOP??,"You can watch tv, pick up a book or listen to old wise men. Either way, you won't get the real expressions of streets of the south. These guys (Goodie Mob) are painting pictures with 4 brains and 1 brush. Simply amazing how teamwork really stands out on this album.Now well over 10yrs old (the album) you can really count your blessings when listening to this. When today we're so overwhelmed with the WACKA FLACKA'S of the world.Long story short....... GOOD MUSIC BY GOODIE MOB."
5,classic,"On the strength of Cell Therapy alone i would buy this....but there's more to the disc than that ( if that is possible to believe )This is what rap is all about; a message.. not about ice, and women, and material wealth.....tight rhymin', classic hooks, and cee-lo make this a classic.... in fact, the entire unit was tight, and you can see that in the way they flow...."
4,"Dogma/No Dogma, is still Dogma (but this is post post modernisn, so who cares?)","Regardless of what the authors write about, whether symmetrical or asymmetrical design should be used and when, it is, in my opinion, complete and with illustrations. This book was, I believe, to give courage and to inspire the book designer, to introduce a new idea (that the spine is the central axis and not the page itself) and to ask the reader(s) to contemplate. I do find the cover lovely as both symmetry and asymmetry is used to show that both work together and in contrast."
1,Still haven't gotten the book....,"Well, I ordered the book on Jan 18th (a month ago) and it still hasn't shipped. The email asking me to write a review reminded me that I even ordered it in the first place. So, maybe this vendor is awesome at other things, but not very reliable when it comes to e-commerce.Yeah, that's it."
3,Rash and Burn,"I have to admit, I only picked this up for the hard to find 'The Club' by Sugar Ray. There are some decent cuts on here, but they could've eliminated the game dialogue between tracks...kinda annoying. Unless you have a favorite tune on here, I'd look elsewhere. I only play it for one song...good thing I bought it used."
3,Whassup with the orange,"KInda a weird color but me and my friends are coo with it for now we arent to picky, oh wait yeah we are. Strange looking but me and my homeys are okay for now I guess. Peace up atown down"
2,bad copy,"I got my movie and was excited, but when I put it in, the copy was not very clear but worse was that their heads were slightly cut off in the frame. I am very disappointed. I wasted my money with this one. I had my own old copy for years but it finally stopped working. This new one is just bad."
1,LAME,"I suffered through this movie at work the other day, because we had some down time, and I didn't have a book with me. It must be a big hit with severe head injury survivors, but I don't know who else would waste their time with this crap.The movie has two jokes than run the entire length, and neither are funny. Watch Bernie's corpse slam into things, and worse, watch Bernie come to life and dance when music is playing. Ho ho. Perhaps our military would find this film useful in interrogations.If your idea of great comedy is watching a middle aged man dance the limbo for two hours, occasionally falling down, or banging his head into something, then this movie was made for you."
3,Weekend At Bernie's 2,I loved the first Bernies and it was hilarious. This one is not quite as good but still has lots of laughs as poor Bernie is dragged around.
2,Bernie should've just stayed dead,"This movie is super cheesy. I only bought it because I had Bernie's I, which is much better. They almost made a Bernie's III, but it got lost in, what they call, ""development hell.""I have a feeling that if they indeed made a Bernie's III, it'd be worse than the II. Don't buy it. Rent it and make a copy."
3,Disappointing,This movie really falls short compared to the original. Although there are a few funny moments if you've seen the first one I think you'll be disappointed. Having said that it's still a good film.
1,Good Ratings ? lol,"A witch doctor makes it that Bernie's dead body can move when music is played which is probably the only slightly funny thing about this movie. That's all you really need to know about this bad and uneeded sequel to the stupid and cheesey but pretty damn funny original. This movie is just stupid without the laughs. I'm surprised so many people here liked it. I like that in How I Met Your Mother how when they try to get a friend to get over a girl. They say ""she laughed during Weekend at Bernies 2!"". Yeah there is something wrong with someone if they actually laugh during this entirely awful movie lol. I admit that Terry Kiser is sorta brilliant yet again as a dead body though. He's about all this movie has going for it."
5,SIMPLY HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie is a must watch if u wanna get out of those moody blues..........if u wanna laugh get this one....every moment is worth it.......a dancing dead body........wat cud be better!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Bernie is sooooooo hot,"I think that bernie is the greatest movie ever. Thank you for giving my life meaning! I thought that this movie was funny to watch, and even better to live after. I want to enjoy this movie for years to come!"
5,Weekend at Bernie's II,I absolutely loved this movie and after seeing the first one knew this one would be just as funny.
2,not excellent,"I installed Epson 3010 3 D with this mount, price is good but you gotta figure out little bit how you gonna do it on epson3010 3d"
2,A bit clunky,"Not easy to assemble, unclear instructions and connectors not tailored to my optima projector purchase. However, it gets the job done and you can make adjustments in any direction."
1,Poor quality,"This is a really low quality mount. The top bracket came bended. I have to straighten it up myself, which is not easy. Also, as pointed out by others, it does NOT fit larger projector like Epson 8350. I wish I didn't buy it."
3,"Not quite ""universal""","This mount DOES NOT work with an Acer 5360. The holes on the projector for the screws to attach the mount to the projector itself are too close together. You can play with this distance a little bit on this model by moving the legs in and out, but not enough to match up with the holes on the projector. I'm too lazy to return it so I ended up using it by taking a hacksaw to the pieces to get them to fit. But, obviously this isn't what you are looking for. If I had to do it over again I would buy one capable of fitting mounting holes that are close together or just buy this one:Projector-Gear Projector Ceiling Mount for ACER H5360If it fits your projector then it's a good buy and really let's you fine tune all the angles, etc very easily."
2,Not a great choice,Basic construction and design leave a lot to be desired. Does not fit larger projectors used in most media rooms today.
5,Great for any projectors,"I love it and it is easy to install without instructions but when you open the box and seeing too many parts, any one would expect more step by step instructions but I got it install in no time and hanged my projector. Love it!! Great price for the quality!!"
2,Theater Projector Ceiling Mount,"Would not fit my new Optima HD20 projector -- as projectors get smaller the mounting holes get closer together -- this mount had four arms and the projector had three -- the mount had arms that would not get short enough to reach the three projector holes -- for larger projectors may work better, but for mine would not recommend -- returning it was very easy and the company representatives very helpful -- so if you get it and it doesn't work, the company is easy to work with --"
1,Waste of money,"The instructions were next to incomprehensible, and if you have a projector that only mounts with 3 holes, there are no instructions on how to do it (hint: you have to remove one of the mounting arms and re-mount in the center position). After I went through all of that, I found that the center pole was attached to the bracket at an angle and I could not loosen it to straighten to a 90 degree angle, and this made it next to impossinble to get it positioned correctly for the screen. This wouldn't have been so bad, but mounting bracket also has no yaw control (horizontal rotation), only roll and tilt, which is not good for precise postioning. I ended up having to get an Optoma bracket (more expensive) to mount my HD20 projector."
2,No go for Optoma HD20,"If you're looking at this device for your Optoma HD20, SKIP IT!The price point is certainly nice and this mount would probably work ok with most projectors, but not the HD20. The legs, that would screw into your projector, don't fit. There are four of them, in which only two are usable without any modification. I don't know about you, but two legs to hold up my projector doesn't give me warm fuzzies.Eventually after about 30min of trying every which way to adjust the legs and get three of them to attach, it just wasn't happening. I had to actually cut one of the longer legs shorter (they only give you one short leg to use) to make it work. It's a little ghetto fabulous, but it works.I can't complain too much, since I went cheap and knew it was probably a bad idea...to save time and hassle, and if you have the money, just spend more on a better mount.This item doesn't come with very clear instructions, but if you've ever assembled anything from Ikea then you're good to go."
1,"parts are sized wrong, impossible to assemble","I thought this would be a good mount, and maybe it would be, if it came assembled. This crap came shipped to me in a bunch of pieces. The instructions were hard to understand, and just looking at the first diagram, it's actually missing a part in the instructions. WHen trying to assemble it according to the instructions, some of the bolts were too short. The mixed bag of bolts and washers was also very difficult to identify which is which. In the end, I tried every single possible combination and came to the conclusion that the bolts they sent were WRONG. I would like to have the last hour of my life back which i wasted tried to assemble this piece of crap. They made this in China for $1. Don't buy it, go to home depot and figure something out for cheaper."
1,Not really unversal,"Fine product, nothing wrong with it, but it's not really universal. It didn't fit my Epson 3010 projector I ordered at the same time."
3,Adequate Projector Mount,"OK, it's not a major brand name product, or some other nicer mounts, but did the job for me. I own 2 projectors..a dedicated Home Theater with a JVC projector and a Family Room with an electric screen and an Optoma HD 70.I needed an extension on a slope ceiling and found this mount at a great price. The quality of the pieces were surprisingly good . I could adjust the drop to whatever amount needed and it hung nicely from my ceiling. My only real complaint was mounting the mount to a small projector. With some work, I was able to make it work, but only with 2 screws attached to 2 brackets..still plenty strong to support a light unit like the Optoma .So, I can recommend this mount for this projector. The swivel and tilt was fine as well.."
1,Missing parts,"Intructions vague. Comes with a ramdome assortment bag of nuts, bolts and washers. Many not even relevant and some that you do need not in bag. This is junk."
1,Do NOT BUY,"This product seemed to come with improper parts, the instructions/separation of items was incredibly difficult to understand, and at the end of the day that piece worked so poorly that I through it out and just installed a shelf for my projector instead. Don't buy it."
1,BAD PRODUCT!!! Warning!,"BAD PRODUCT- Has a major design flaw that when a Projector of only 12.5 lbs was mounted to it within a few minutes the projector crashed to the floor! $3,500 Loss!!!! This was mounted in a House of Worship, a huge loss to us, huge!The square tubing only has a small indent holding it together even with bolts tight! It's only a matter of time once something is mounted to it before it will come apart and crash to the ground.I have no idea what to do for replacement of our Projector. But have had no luck with Amazon in some cases.VideoSecu Universal LCD/DLP Projector Ceiling Mount Bracket White Fits both flat or Vaulted ceiling PJ2W 1CA"
1,Buyer beware,"When purchasing a projector on Amazon from any dealer, this mount is suggested as a universal mount for every projector. It is not UNIVERSAL! I purchased the OPTOMA HD20, and this mount does not universally attach to this projector. The Optoma Brand Mount screws into a single spot that is large, sturdy offcenter, but they provide tiny screw holes for a tripod style attachment, and these are used for the universal mounts. This particular universal mount has four higly adjustable arms to attach to a projector, but they will not squeeze smaller to the tripod screw holes provided by the OPTOMA HD20 projector. Should not be suggested with ALL projectors,as it does not work for the Optoma HD20."
4,Fits my Optoma HD23 perfectly,"I am very thankful for other helpful reviewers who posted pictures of the different setup possibilities for fitting an Optoma HD23 projector. Overall, this unit is solid and comes with everything you need to get up and running."
1,Buyer be aware: It is not universal mount at all,"The product is cheap, so does the quality and overall design. The product is quite deceptive with a ""UNIVERSAL"" title. It is not. As you go over through the reviewer comments, you will find that many projectors are not COMPATIBLE with this product.Amazon should not automatically link this mount with any projector that is not compatible with this product.The seller is very arrogant when I contacted them and asked them to place more information upfront, so the users are aware its limitation. The seller does not understand what is a good business practice and what is customer oriented service."
1,Does NOT work with Epson 8350,"Despite the instructions saying that it will fit any projector that has 12.5"" or less clearance between holes this will not fit on an Epson 8350. You can get 3 holes to barely mount, however it puts the mounting bracket at an angle and the adjustments don't allow for the mount to be parallel or perpendicular. If you are mounting on a ceiling stud, it will not work!"
4,Good little device,"Pros: This mounting bracket was very easy to install on our drop ceiling. And is also very user friendly to adjust the swivel to go up or down, left or right for an accurate screen on our wallCon: Did not have screws that fit in our Epson projector. I had to take our projector to a hardware store and make sure the screws would fit.Other than not having the supplied screws this bracket is very nice to have."
3,Needs a redesign,"Assembly instructions are not quite clear, and some pieces are very difficult to put together, especially after threading the cables through the shaft high up by the ceiling. Also, my HDMI cable is heavily shielded, and did not thread easily through the shaft. Getting my RG6 and power cord through were also tough. I'm happy with it now that it's up, but it would be better if the finished product was more rigid. Another complaint is that they provide 4 and 5mm bolts to attach the mount, but mine needed 6mm, so off to Home Depot. Off again to Home Depot for a second trip, as the lag screws they provide to thread into the ceiling joist are made of metal so soft a phillips head screwdriver will strip them. I got them most of the way in before they stripped, then had to use a pair of vice-grips to take them out. I got some stainless steel ones and installed them with a socket wrench. Overall a decent product for the price, but they shouldn't provide screws as soft as ju-ju-bees."
5,Great ceiling mount!,"Very sturdy and good quality. The screws/anchors that come with it are thicker than needed to provide extra protection. The metal is very sturdy and solid and it tightens down all around to provide a very stable mount. It was relatively easy to set up and adjust.The hardest part was inserting a little spacer into the top mount so that you could connect/screw in a 2ndary tie down point. My hands are big so I just used tape to hold the spacer and washers in place for the screws.I was even able to pull it down and project out from under a ceiling fan in the middle of my living room.The only thing I found that I wish it had was some sort of horizontal rotation plate/capability without having to loosen the 3 mounts connected to the projector.Highly recommended though at any price, but a real bargain at this price!"
4,I would consider it universal,"This is an awesome mount and it holds the projector well. I would consider this universal, although it DOES require some messing around. I had to go buy screws for it because the ones in the kit for my particular model used longer screws. People complaining that it is not universal are stupid. If it doesn't work, don't make a big deal out of it...send it back. Not all ""universal"" things ARE universal.This is much better than a bookshelf behind my couch :).Also used this wish Push2TV so I have it wirelessly playin movies!"
4,"HD20 Mount Works, but some work","I bought this mount because it had good reviews and I was conflicted if it would work with the HD20. Well, it does. Like other reviews, there are no instructions to help you. Plus, in order to make it work, you have to remove one of the legs, move one leg to the front center screw hole, change around the ""lower legs"" to the smaller inserts, and then use a drill to place a needed hole in the leg to allow the proper length.The good is that the mount is rock solid, holds the projector well, and was easy to put up once I got it attached to the projector. A special note, use the middle wood screw to hold the projector on the wall before you sink the other two after positioning. It does look a little un sightly, but they all do.For the price, if you are willing to play the positional and drill game, great mount."
4,Great Price,"I almost bought one of the store mounts for $125 but decided to check online first. This one came in and worked great. I have an oversized projector and had to fabricate two longer brackets to replace the stock ones so it would fit my projector. I would not have had to modify anything on a normal projector. Once that was done, the thing worked great. I actually mounted it in one room and needed the drop down adjustment to hang lower. The mount worked beautifully. The wife then decided we needed to move everything into another room with a lower ceiling and it worked great without the drop down bar. For this, I needed to add spacers to get the upper bracket to work better. I think these should have been included in the package but they weren't. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Solid mount for a heavy projector. GREAT price too!"
4,Worked for my Optoma Projector,Was a little messy with the packaging of the screws and looked a little used but it was in decent shape to use and for the price I couldn't beat it. Good buy
3,Good for price,"Seems a little wobbly and makes it difficult to adjust the projector exactly as wanted. I will be replacing this with a sturdy shelf soon, as I do not like the control it gives me."
4,Works with Optoma HD20,"I used this with an Optoma HD20.The anchors that came with it are for concrete and can't really be used with dry-wall. Don't even bother, they don't provide a strong fitGood quality and pretty robust. My only issue was that it was a bit complicated to figure out and making fine adjustments is a bit difficult because the screws are tough to adjust. It would have been great to have some type of hand twistable locks for making adjustments.For the HD20, use the photos one user put up here for a guide to putting them up and getting the legs right. two of the legs can flip around when you unscrew the middle bolt. Kinda hard to explain, but you'll eventually figure it out.A bit of a pain to put up, but i'll take a little extra mounting work and get this $50 cheaper mount anytime."
5,videoSecu Univ ceiling mount,"This did the job that was needed!! I used this mount for an Inforcus projector for our theatre room. First off, prior reviews made me suspect of buying this because they stated flimsy quality, mount, hardware, etc. I hooked this too a stud in the ceiling and it easliy held my wife a couple feet from the floor!!!!!!! The instructions could be a little bit better, but its pretty much common sense. Pitch and yaw angles are minimal, but will get the job done to make sure your have a straight picture. I even hooked this mount to an Optoma just to see if it would fit and no suprises it did with ease. If you contemplating this mount, I would say get it!! it is surely worth the cheap price and the delivery time was amazing as well!"
3,Well made but small,"This mount is well designed and adequate but it doesn't fit larger projectors. It would not fit my Epson UB8500.I had to fabricate a plate out of 14ga. sheet metal, then attach it to the projector and then attach the mount. So if you don't have these kind of facilities at home better off looking for a different mount if your projector is large."
1,"Doesn't fit Epson 8350, despite Amazon ""recommendation""","This thing doesn't fit an Epson 8350 without buying additional hardware. Nothing ""universal"" about it, and Amazon shouldn't suggest it as a companion product."
2,Does not fit on an Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 8350,"A warning to those of you with an Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 8350 - the mounting for this Projector bracket does not open up wide enough to connect to the screw points on the Epson unit. I was forced to make some extenders with available scrap metal but it was a pain.Be warned! This VideoSecu Universal is not quite ""universal""."
3,ACER H5360 beware,This is a good mount. Not great... I bought it for my ACER H5360 and it does not have the screws the fit the mounting holes in the projector. I had to go to the hardware store and find some.The mount takes some adjusting to fit the ACER H5360 but after about 30min and a trip to the hardware store i got it to work.
3,Not Fit Epson 8350,I ordered this universal mount based on some good review saying it fits 8350. But extending the brackets to the longest extent still cannot reach the screw holes on the unit. The distance of the five screw holes 8350 are so wide that this mount cannot fit any four of them. The build quality of this mount is pretty good and maybe it is perfect for other units so I cannot give it 1 star rating based on frustration with mounting 8350. Finally I ended up with returning this mount and ordered a mount specifically designed for 8350.
4,Works well; difficult to install; doesn't come with drywall anchor kit,"Installing the feet onto my Vivitek 1080FD was a puzzle. Took me 4 or 5 attempts to get something that would project and swivel the correct direction. There are a lot of tweaks you can make to swivel the projector over different axes once it's initially installed. Due to the unanticipated flexibility of the mount, I was able to get an extra 10"" of screen space due to being able to work around my ceiling fan and overall room conditions.One complaint I do have is there's only an anchor kit for concrete, but not for drywall. I guess they expect you to find a stud, but in my location I was unable to use the stud and still have the picture centered. I just picked up an anchor kit from Home Depot and from there installation went smoothly."
3,Useful but full of hassle,"I bought this bracket for my HD20 Projector for my small home theater. It does the job, but is full of frustrations. The first frustration is that it's directions are pretty bad and most of the assembly and installation is left up to intuition and trial and error. Since it is ""universal"" I finally did manage to get it attached to my projector, but not until I had to practically disessemble it to get it to align with the mounting points on the projector. As for the extension, its good, but frustrating to get into place due to where some of the screw are located. All in all it works and does what its supposed to do, but it the frustration and time required to get there may not be worth it for some."
4,It works,This mount work fine for me. The thing that upset me was the cheap screws that mount it to the ceiling. I had one break in half with little force. I recommend using different screws.
3,"1/4"" socket rail",These are Chinese-made spring clips which hold sockets together for organizing. Cheap but they work well enough. Suggest purchasing more than one as additional clips for sockets will be needed with full sets.
2,Flawed Series,You'd think a western tv series starring Henry Fonda would have to be good right? WRONG! Very disappointing. And who's bright idea was it to give a western series a jazz soundtrack. What a mess.
1,THE DEPUTY 12 episodes,Some of the episodes are ok but 2 of them are virtually unviewable. I have always been pleased with the quality of material put out by TIMELESS but this is far below there standards. They claim these are the best prints they could find of the episodes but I cannot believe this as there collectors out there with 16mm copies of lots of things. I accept that due to the age of the material imperfections are expected but this collection is one of the worst I have come across. Get back to the good work you do TIMELESS and lets have no more like this!
3,As advertised,"After fifty years, it must be difficult to get the original material to put out a set like this, and Timeless is up-front about the quality of the shows, and no where did I see anything about 'complete' season. It is 12 episodes, as stated on the box (the wrong # of running minutes is pretty easy to figure out, if it is 12 half hour shows...must be a misprint!).Sure there are a couple of shows that are pretty sub-par, but I'm just glad to have The Deputy on DVD, since it never runs in my area, and I haven't seen it since the sixties.I love Henry Fonda, and even though the show is uneven, and isn't the best western of the period, it stands up as a good example of early TV westerns.By the way, check out the other titles Timeless puts out, like Laredo, Laramie and Wagon Train. And another great tv show, M-Squad, with Lee Marvin, the cop show that set the standard for cop shows."
2,disappointed,"As stated on the tape introduction, some episodes are poor quality. One of the episodes would not play at all. Needed to reconsider this product on the market with this lack of quality."
3,The Deputy,This was a short lived series but was well done. Henry Fonda was the draw for this series but I beleive that Allan Case carried the series because he was the constant character. Henry Fonda's character would come and go but the Deputy was always present in the story lines.
5,Caissons and Cables,"Don't be fooled by the size and shape of this book, or by the illustrations -- this is a ""picture book"" for ages 9-12, and even for adults. In fact, the text seems almost as if it's written for adults, particularly the long sentences and the sentence structure. The sentences are fully understandable, though, and they tell a magnificent story of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge. I particularly enjoyed the information on how the caissons were built and how they functioned, and the danger within. And I also loved the information on how the cables were strung. While the author does talk about the laborers (mostly Irish) who actually built the bridge, it is only in passing. I would have liked to see their story in more detail."
2,Not a 2 piece,"I received this order a couple of weeks back.This is a two sided 1 PIECE Metric Flip impact socket NOT a ""2 Piece 1/2"" Drive Metric Flip Impact Automotive Socket Set"". I guess that's where the ""Flip"" comes into play. The 1/2"" drive is recessed in the middle of the socket. I think you need an extension to use the bit as the 1/2"" drive is in the middle. You can't directly hook up to a standard impact wrench without an extension to the 1/2"" drive.I don't know why they called this a socket set, because all I received was one socket and nothing else.I wish they would clear this up in the title and the picture listed for this item.I gave it two stars for this reason, as far as durability, use, etc... I have not had the chance to use this socket."
3,Big Disappointment,"I was so disappointed by this book! It came highly recommended by two different people who said they just couldn't put it down. I was so hopeful about this book that I bought it new rather than borrowing it. Based on what I had heard and read, I was sure I would love it.It was set in a time period and culture that I am particularly interested in but it left me flat. There were so many loose ends and little character development. I just didn't CARE about most of the characters. There truly was a GOOD story in there but it just didn't work for me. I was interested in Lillian, Abe's mistress, but she kept coming and going until she was gone with NO explanation.There was just no color in the characters for me and I'm sorry it was my selection for my book group."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. The subject matter had great promise but failed to live up to it. This is a family story that takes place in Buffalo,NY. There are four adult sisters and one adult brother. The head of the family is a recently widowed father. It starts with the disappearance of one sister. The story then introduces the rest of the family, and their reaction to the disappearance. I felt the characters never reached a fullness so that I could care about them. There were a lot of words to the story and sometimes they made no sense. The one character that I enjoyed and could almost root for was the father's girlfriend. She was a woman with a jaded past but she was flesh and blood and I cared how things would work out for her. Nobody else in the family liked her. Family stories are one of my favorite story lines but this one did not satisfy my appetite."
1,"Choppy, boring, lacking unity, & no plot","This book is a string of characters thoughts with nothing of interest to hold it together. You don't identify with any of the characters as they are all shallow, wallowing in the wind, not knowing what they believe or want in life. What a true bore and waste of time."
3,VERY VERY BASIC,"Useful for someone with very minimal mechanical ability, beyond that the book is not very helpful. Parts photos and diagrams are lacking. I expected more."
4,Such a delight to read!,"This book is a delight. It's a fun satire, seeing just how politically correct you can get. And like all fairy tales, it should be read in small doses, just a little at a time. It's a definitely a fun twist on your beloved Grimm's, and if you like reading all versions of fairy tales (I've read countless versions of Cinderella and I'm still not sick of it... except the Disney/French version), this is a modern twist that you won't want to miss."
2,Good Idea in Theory....,"It's hard for me to start tearing this book apart and pointing out all the little things I don't like, so I'll take the lazy route and condemn the entire book. Every story is written in such a trite fashion that I couldn't even finish it. I guess I had been hoping for new interesting versions of old fairy tales with little differences (like Little Red Riding Hood wearing little red pants or something). But as with all books except one, it could be worse."
2,Political Correctness has a negative effect on literature.,"Politically Correct Bedtime Stories is a classic example of the way society's turn to political correctness can in turn ruin our cherished tales. The storyline is altered which takes away from the ending and leaves the reader thinking ""this story was much better the first time I heard it."""
4,A PC Field Guide,"Illustrating the absurd, using the PC crowd's own words and mindset. This is a LOL field guide for dealing with the Mothers Against McDonald's crowd and a fun read to boot!(Remember if you have no goals in life, you can't fail at anything!)"
5,Classic Satire!,"I found this to be a funny and spot-on mocking of much of the political correctness that is so popular these days. From the twisting of the tails, to the mocking of politically correct misspellings of words used by the ""enlightened,"" themselves. This is a classic."
1,Not like the Restaurant,"This mix is not at all like the restaurant. I have been hoping to find a way to have Panang Curry at home, and this is not it. It is missing some key ingredient????"
1,"Bland, just spicy","When added to coconut milk/fish sauce it just makes it tastes like spicy coconut milk. The flavor it adds is minimal. It would make it disgustingly spicy for a sweet dish if I put enough of it in to actually make it taste like panang.Ingredients: Garlic, chili, sugar, onion, lemongrass, dextrose, salt ....the most used ingredients aren't exactly exotic, and the other stuff probably is in low enough quantities that its overpowered by the strength of the garlic chili and onion. It either has too much salt and sugar or too little of the special ingredients that makes panang panang. Do not buy this junk."
5,"tasty and so easy, great with seafood","While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use, fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. For the price, you can't do better--it's affordable, easy, and fun to make!The panang curry has a nice mellow flavor with some spice and goes quite well with seafood. Some great compliments to this sauce: scallops, shrimp, squid, and fish; if you add all of these, you get an insanely tasy, luxurious meal. Another thing you can do is add a hint of thai basil to cook with all this--it gives it an extra authentic feel and works well with the overall dish!"
5,great album,No Substance is a great album but I think all ages is better. two of the songs on No Substance sound exactly the same: The biggest killer in american history and the hippy killers but it's still a great album.
2,That's Punk!,"This is a really good Punk CD. The songs are the usual style of Bad Religion but much better than the last albums. Especially I like ""Raise your Voice"" with Campino from Germany's best punk band ""Die toten Hosen""."
3,This is my least favorite BR album...,"This album doesn't have the punch of other Bad Religion albums. No Substance followed 1995's ""The Gray Race"", which I personally feel is the best Bad Religion album. I bought this album hoping for something equal to that, but I was dissappointed. This is the only BR album that I can say bores me. The only song that I really enjoyed was ""A Strange Denial"". If you don't already have every other Bad Religion CD, you should buy one with more substance."
5,No Brett and new Bad religion = still outstanding,"I don't get why ""fans"" of BR can say this is not a good Cd.This sound is what BR is all about. I have almost all BR alblums. I like them all (The New America wore out its welcome though). Post Brett alblums like ""The Grey Race"" and ""No Substance"" are both awsome records, given they don't sound like ""suffer"" or ""No control""...they each have their own GREAT sound. And there are still hints of ""suffer"" in this alblum. Greg is a great songwriter...better then Brett, I think. This alblum proves it. Best songs in my opinion are ""Shades of truth"" ""Raise your ""voice"" and ""At the Mercy of Imbeciles"".This CD has great deversity....get it."
2,some good songs,"If you like the older bad religion albums (the good stuff) you'll hate this cd. It has a few good songs such as at the mercy of imbeciles. if you are new to bad religion buy a better album such as suffer, no control, or recipe for hate. I wish this Cd was worth the $20 i paid at the record store but its not, save your money or buy a better Cd."
4,It grows on you,"I anticipated this release for months. When I finally got my hands on it, at first I was somewhat dismayed. ""What is THIS?"" I remember saying to several of the songs. Bad Religion is such a good band, that it's hard to think that they could put out -dare I say it- mediocre songs. I think what initially turned me off to this CD was the poppiness it seemed to exhibit in many of the songs. But after extensive listening, it grew on me and I now listen to it quite often. Some of the songs sound like rehashing of the rehashed, but all in all, it's not a bad CD. Songs to consider on this CD are Raise Your Voice, The State of the End of the Millennium Address, Hear It, and Mediocre Minds."
2,This is mediocre...,"This is the first real disappointing Bad Religion album in years. Unlike the absolutely BRILLIANT ""The Gray Race"" (yes, that album is brilliant, and criminally underrated), the songs all slog at midtempo, featuring uninspired vocals from Graffin, unenergetic guitar playing, and overall, poor songwriting, and overall...just repetitive formulaic pop-punk.Avoid this album."
2,No Substance enough to make an album,"This album, No Substance, is like nothing. Even if it was the first album from a brand new band, I'd hate it..and we're not talking about fresh-made babies, but punk-rock veterans, directly from the old school. While listening to this album, I just miss sentences like No Bad Religion can make your life complete or I want to conquer the world, and give all the idiots a brand new religion. There's nothing with the same energy, the same intelligence. On the first verse of All Fantastic Images, they complain about England (hmm...o..kay..), the Mediocre Mind chorus is awful and most of all, the worst Bad Religion song ever, Raise Your Voice! is on this album. A few good points tho: the 2 Killers songs are nice, Hear It is kinda good....but really, that's it. For more recent and listenable Bad Religion stuff, go check for The Process of Belief. That's what I call good music, not No Substance. Thank you."
1,worst cd..best song,"this is the worst bad religion cd aside from new america.....although 'sowing the seeds of utopia' is one of there best songs...worth checking out for that song alone, but the rest of the cd is crap"
2,Subpar,"This is honestly the only Bad Religion album that isn't in my normal rotation for listening. Now, for me it's not that the band has slowed down their songs that makes this album less than a treat, but it's the lack of those ultra-catchy choruses and solo guitar riffs we've come to expect from Bad Religion. The entire album is absent from any catchy, emotive, and memorable lines. It kind of just trudges along, like they were going through the motions.There are a few decent songs (Hear it, Shades of Truth, Greatest Killer...), but nothing even resembling spectacular like on their other albums. I only recommend No Substance if you must have everything Bad Religion."
2,"Quirky gift, but short on information","To fill a book with 365 unique tidbits of why someone should be a vegetarian is a difficult task to undertake. The author does their best to make the reasons interesting, however, it becomes apparent that there is little substance to this book. There are numerous quotes from ""famous"" persons which were quite interesting.Overall, this book is an easy read, but I found it to be quite repetitive. It makes a quirky gift for a vegetarian, but no serious information about the vegetarian lifestyle can be gained from reading it."
4,Romance,"Finally this film has been released on DVD. This is the first opportunity that I have ever had to view it. In many ways, the plot is a precursor of Camille though no where near as good. Garbo is an Italian Opera singer with a ""past"" who falls in love with a young pastor and gives him up in the end. Her co star Gavin Gordon is no heart throb which takes away from the plot. Just what does she see in him ?? Swedish Garbo does an Italian accent in her second talkie which is intriguing. It's a must for Garbo Fans but for the general film viewer it would be of little entertainment."
2,Great Disappointment,"Being a great ""Garbo-Fan"", I was really disappointed in this film. Not for a minute did I believe the ""love story"" between Rita and the minister. Everything seemed much too forced. Enjoy her as ""A woman of Affairs"" or ""Camille"" - I think she did not do herself a favour in accepting this role."
3,Christmas Wedding,"I am a true fan of Mr Greeley, but this book left me very disappointed. I felt I was reading a mixture of past books with only their names changed."
4,This book explained a lot!,"I had read all the other books in the Chuck and Rosemarie series, but not this one. It made several things clear that had been puzzling me in the saga. It is a typical Greeley book, and if you like his style, you'll like this book."
1,Really Bad,"I think that this is the most poorly written book that I have ever read. A mixture of Chatechism, (romantic) handbook, and U.S. history with some Forest Gump thrown in. I kept trying to figure out how a kid could graduate from High School, serve time in the Army at the end of WW2 and get a college degree by the time he was 22. It took him a couple of more years to win a Pullitzer. If you like REALLY light reading you MAY enjoy this."
4,6.5 x 12 Patriotic American Flag Sticker,Product arrived promptly and was exactly as described online.It is a large sticker. I put it on my car. It looks nice.
4,lions,Recevied in excellent shape and time. I absolutely have no worry over the company I used in getting the materials to me. The book did contain the topic I was after but it wasn't the author I was looking for. Writing style is very stitled and more of a journal then carrying out the storyline.
4,Really interesting,I saw the movie and was keen to check the facts. The author understates the events nicely and you can only deduce that he has nerves of steel. I thoroughly enjoyed the read
3,man eaters of tzavo,I liked it. It was very enthralling and kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. It was written in the early 1900's in the first person. I liked the style of writing too because it seemed like a genuine account of what was happening and not just some imaginary story.
5,the ghost and the darkness,This book was every bit as interesting as the movie that came from it. Even more so since it was a factual account. To think that two lions could coordinate attacks like these is staggering. Makes you think that maybe there was evil spirits at work ...
4,"I liked the movie better, honestly","A reasonably good and interesting memoir about hunting wild animals in East Africa. John Henry Patterson became famous for killing the two man-eating lions of Tsavo, who are now on display in the Chicago Field Museum. Only the first half of this book is about the Tsavo lions, though; the second half is about his hunting other animals such as rhinos, etc.Patterson seemed like a pretty likeable guy to me, modest, and not very racist by late 19th-century British Empire standards. The book made me feel distinctly uncomfortable though, because just about every animal whom he stalked and killed with such relish is now an endangered species in large part because of hunters like him. But if you like African adventure stories, you'll like this."
5,The most intelligent American poetry of the century...,"The metaphysical composure, the simplicity of expression, and the rich austerity of William Bronk's poetry has a power reminiscent of T.S. Eliot, whose ability to reflect on the root questions of our life and civilization he shared. This is poetry that will speak to the prosaic moments of your daily thought, and your sense of reality itself, at the same time. It is poetry that will be read a century from now, and so you should read it now..."
4,One of my favorite cookbooks,"Unfortunately the Kalahikiola church (Big Island, Hawaii) stopped producing this cookbook! I was lucky to find a clean edition for my daughter. I use many of the local recipes when I miss the great Korean, Hawaiian and other Hawaii style restaurants. If you like Hawaiian style cooking, it's a great find, just hard to come by these days!"
1,Wasted Money,Extremely disappointing. Definately not worth the money. It is more like an advertisement and publicity for Reynolds Polymer. Does not really contain information on acrylic.
3,The Race,"Yet another fine book by Dr. Goldratt. This was more of a detail oriented book about the Theory of Constraints; but to be honest, I did get more out of Goldratt's The Goal. There is something about business novels which really grab my attention; they make learning more of an experience than simply reading theory. Had I read The Race without reading The Goal, I most likely would have recommended this book. Having read both, if I had to make a single recommendation, I would go with The Goal and pass on this one."
4,Illustration for understanding.,"Some books show you the text, some books show you illustration. ""The Race"" is an illustration of ""The Goal (Goldratt)"". Some people may like the Novel style of the goal but some people may need more illustration of it and The Race is what you're looking for. I see The Race is not only a good companion of The Goal, but it can be used as ""Class material"" as well. The DBR illustration is clearly stated and I don't think I can see any illustration of The Goal production system better than this book. Goldratt may consider to put some figures from The Race in the new edition of The Goal to make the Goal the perfect book of production system novel."
4,Perfect for Introduction to TOC and Presentation Help,"This is basically the ""powerpoint"" version of TOC. It is not a how-to guide or a novel like most TOC material. I would recommend buying one copy for any group starting a TOC implementation or needing to present TOC concepts (great slide ideas). It doesn't deserve a place on everyone's desk like some of the other TOC books, but has value for those who have read or seen The Goal and now need to participate in an implementation."
3,Book with constraints...,"After reading most books of the TOC series from Goldratt, it was time to convert knowledge into wisdom. The content of this book and the way the teaching was done didn't grab me though.Because the previous books (The Goal, It's not Luck, etc.) were written like novels, this book seems a bit like that math addendum you may have gotten at school. First size you up with compelling stories and then throw some cold-hearted sums in your face. However, if you want to learn more about TOC and how to apply it this book will help you.If you like sudoku you may like this one. If you've read the other books from the serie you need to read this one as well, but you may not like it."
5,This is just the beginning...,"Certainly it's hard to go wrong nowadays with the production team of La'Face backing you, but Az Yet's talents truly set them apart from the plethora of R&B groups. Their sound is unique, their passion is evident, and their talent is unquestionable. ""Last Night"" introduced us to Az Yet and captivated us through their album until ""Time To End The Story"". This album chronicles all of the ups and downs of relationships. You feel all the pain, ecstasy, and bittersweetness due to their passionate vocals. ""Inseparable Lovers"" is so unique in its concept and delivery while the Brian McKnight authored ""Through My Heart (The Arrow)"" takes you back to the days of Cupid. There isn't a bad song on this album. Their subsequent albums should be just as timeless."
5,"Cover Of Chicago's ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry""","Az Yet has a cover of Chicago's ""Hard To Say I Am Sorry"", with Peter Cetera, to be copied in the voice of 1982."
5,So Romantic,"This album is the greatest thing I've ever listened to. It's so sweet, every song is prefect. If you're in love with somone special or wish you were this entire cd is perfect for you. As a matter of fact this album is just perfect. The harmony and rhythm will set the mood for romance"
1,BabyFace Leftovers,not much different than A Few Good Men.very run of the mill Material.very 2nd-rate.Babyface does this Material in his sleep.very dull.
5,Just awesome!,"This song brings back many memories of my high school life now that they're long over. Everytime I hear anyone of their songs I am reminded of how much I enjoyed them then as much, if not more, now. This group truly knows how to write songs that affect and touch the soul of your emotions and tug at your heart-strings. A remake of Chicago's 'Hard to Say Sorry' was past overdue and this group does an excellent job of remaking it... especially the version of this song featuring Peter Cetera (former leader of Chicago) found on 'Hard to Say Sorry's' single.This album is a DEFINATE MUST BUY for anyone who has ever loved someone or wanted to love someone.There are CDs you sometimes buy because they only have a couple good song on them and the rest are useless. This is NOT one of those. There isn't a song on here that I would mind hearing ten times over again. They're truly an exceptional group that should consider making another album."
5,Az Yet's debut album,"I remember this album when I was in the 4th grade. This album was a hit based on the single, Last Night. That is my favorite song of all time. Babyface is correct. The influences of R&B, jazz, blues, hip hop, and gospel that flavour their music is why the group was originally known as ""As Yet Untitled."" The style is described as ever-growing and all-encompassing. They would have been the next Boyz II Men but they broke up. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember, this was 1996."
2,Very disappointing,I got this as a retirement gift for one of my friends. The picture and description made it seem like it was a super steal. When I picked up the box off my front porch I knew it was going to be disappointing. It was so light and small. I'm actually too embarrassed to give it as a give. It's not work $30.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This product looks like it has a pretty tea cup with it. And it had a smooshed picture of it.Worst thing is Mother's day is tomorrow so I cannot return it! You would be much better for the money to buy some teas for gift set.I would return these ( i ordered 2 for my mom and my stepmom), but then I will have nothing for them.the picture on the item is not accurate,that is a teacup (not the cheap cardboard one....)DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!"
5,"Outkast best album, even better than the love below/Speakerb",old school rap.it is awswem great CD period. has great songs listen to the sample songs on the top of the page!~ YEAH! da cd is good
5,Outkast at the top of their game!,"In my opinion this is Outkast's greatest album. It's just so chilled out. Also Jazzy Belle has gotta be the greatest Outkast song of all time. Goodie Mobb even makes a few sweet appearances on this album most notablebly on ""mainstream"", which is a tight song. if u like outkast then u gotta get this album. u won't be sorry."
5,This disk is a MUST have,"On their second LP, OutKast comes back with a very consistent, hard-hitting album. ATLiens is a lyrical journey through life, something they are best at. Elevators, Wheelz of Steel, & the title track rank amongst the best songs the album has to offer. Not many other groups are as consistent as OutKast, and with their second LP, ATLiens, it just proves that fact more and more."
5,Some other Level S#!*,"The album is phat, real and straight to the truth. Life is all about the time you spend with your loved ones. It's not about all that materialistic stuff like, who has the best of whatever. It's straight up truth."
5,Classic! Essential,"I'll keep it short. BUY THIS ALBUM. With 5 classic albums under their belt, OUKAST's best works, in my opinion, are ""ATLiens"" and ""Aquemini"". They are still the Kings of Southern hip-hop in my book."
5,Amazing,"A classic album that needs to be listened to by real hip hop fans. This might not be the album that put them on the map, but one that shows their original style."
5,This CD left mark (good or bad) in Outkast career,"This is one of my favorite Outkast CDs. But the fan base in ATL wasn't going for Alein bit after these same two kats released the smash debut ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"" for all the ""pimps"" and ""gangsters"" in ATL to go nuts over. I assume they wasn't feeling it because the CD really didn't hit big until the smooth pimped-out track ""Jazzy Bell"" hit radio and all headz were praising Outkast.MAKE NO MISTAKES ABOUT ABOUT IT..........THIS IS A CLASSIC PURCHASEoNe"
4,Second Coming,"With their eccentric style and originality, Outkast has set the standard for southern rap. PERIOD! Welcome to their urban realm. It's one hell of a ride, and you love every freakin' second."
4,yes is a pleasant country,"yeah it's good. i wish i had a nice sub so i could say it put the fonk in the tronk. nevertheless, i can imagine. p.s. if you're looking for hey ya you've got the wrong album mister."
4,dope,not a lot of good hip-hop 'round any more.... at least it was good for about ten years. this album's a classic
5,ATLiens,"OutKast is one of the great rap/hip hop bands. The following songs are,in my opinion,the best on the CD:""ATLiens""This song,with a catchy techno/synth beat,comes in on the top three best on this compact disc,even though it gets stuck in your head easily.""Wheelz of Steel""With the best scratching ever heard on a song,(Done by Mr.DJ)""Wheelz of Steel"" is one of the best. Reccomended.""Mainstream""Although I think this song is about someone drowning(One of the lyrics is ""floating face down in the mainstream"")it's still got a good beat and is reccomended for a hip-hop fan.""13th Floor/Growing Old""This song is tricky. For the first one minute and thirty-two seconds,it has a piano and a sort of solemn tune. But then it turns to a synthy DJ styled song. It's ... good.Well,that's all. Hope you get this-I'm pretty sure you'll like it!"
1,I thought this cd kicked some serios a$$,I thought this is the best of all the outkast cds. Especially ATliens that is the greatest song on that cd.
5,Classic,"Outcast made one of the best albums back in 1992, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. They prove themselves again with their sequel. ATliens is just as good. Different than their first one. cant really compare. ATliens got some trippy beats. Some outer space background music. I had to listen to it for a while before i started lovn it. It got funny ryhmes, but that what defines outcast. They aint make that much sense, but it all comes together. One of the best tunes i got. i kinda gettn disapointed with their new albums though, stankonia is ok, but they not as good as they used to. i know ms jackson hit the top charts, but i aint like it that much. all i know is thatit got trippy beats. i had this album for years and i still listen to it all the time. you gotta have this album."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I got this CD for one song, ""One more try"". The song sounds so much better on the radio than it does on this CD. It sounds like he recorded that song in an empty church on the CD. I was very disappointed in the quality of the song. It doesn't even sound like the same song. Totally sucked!!!"
2,Math Handbook with Math Errors,"I love math and I love cars, so I was looking forward to a concise book on the topics. Within reading the first few pages, I found several mistakes. Some were simple mathematical mistakes in converting and others were more serious assumptions about vehicles and others were just due to poor editing, eg. diagrams that were unclear or stating that ""9/12"" converts inches to feet. These first few pages were enough to prove the book shouldn't be taken seriously. There are still some decent formulas and ideas if you keep your eyes open and know enough to catch the rest of it."
4,Very Styling,I have ordered this curtain and have hang it in our dining room ahead of another dark broun silk curtain and it gives a perfect look! The only problem that I gave only 4 starts is that they arrived with several broken hoops and they are not a perfect quality. However I did not return as I like them much and for the price it is a great deal! I have got a lot of compliments for it!
2,great concept that petters out quick,"I had seen the 1st volume of this 6-part graphic novel and was intrigued. the 1st 3 volumes are interesting, and as often happens in this genre, there is a cool idea that gets the process going, then the rest of the story needs to be worked out. this great concept, of an exploratory team finding a billion-year-old, hidden civilisation in deep freeze in the ocean of europa, is never fully developed, and instead of learning about this culture, the story becomes a dreary conflict between a clever, witty weapons inspector and an insane space station commander. the series ends abruptly, without much resolution to the more interesting and engaging story lines involving the alien race and their purpose. warren must have got bored or distracted by another project."
4,A great evening read!,"The art by Chris Sprouse and Karl Story is spectacular. Sprouse has crafted a style that is simple and elegant. All his line-work and compositions are so perfectly designed that you'll find yourself looking at them with awe.The story by Warren Ellis is a page-turner and definitely a satisfying read. Interestingly, at times, I found the character of United Nations Weapons Inspector Nathan Kane and his interactions with the characters in the story more interesting than the story itself.Bring him back Warren. He deserves another series."
3,Ellis problem (re-read 8/10),"This graphic novel is a perfect example of why Warren Ellis frustrates me so much. You have an awesome concept, a brilliant set-up, introduction, and premise, and then he goes and ends the story in like 8 pages. This should have been twice as long, twice as deep, and it would have been far better. So many of the characters, concepts, and fun were left completely unexplained or unprobed.Re-readability: 8/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read. Something can be awesome, but not something I am going to frequenty re-read (Maus), or it can be horrible, but I might still re-read it (Global Frequency).*"
2,I saw the Stargate show too...,I checked this out from the local library and felt cheated buy the Stargate ripoff. I can only imagine what would have happened had I paid money to read this. Ancient human ancestors. Torus wormhole rings. Way too familiar for me...
2,Great Magazine BUT.....!,I paid for 10 issues and only 4 arrived. What a joke! Don't think I won't contest this charge with my credit card company.
1,"Five months after purchase, it never arrived","I ordered French Vogue through Amazon in May. After five months and several phone calls and e-mails to the distributor, I had to ask for a refund. The magazine never came. Each time I asked about it I was told that it takes a long time for French Vogue subscriptions to come through because of the time and language differences. (Absurd.) The American distributor also blamed the many vacation days Europeans take. I got a kick out of that. But I didn't enjoy how quick the distributor was to charge my credit card and how slow the company was to address my concerns.I would have loved to read French Vogue. Too bad I couldn't."
1,Never Got It,I'm still waiting for my first issue. I ordered British Vogue directly from Vogue a few weeks after I ordered this. I'll be curious to see which one I get first.
5,Still a favorite,"Our whole family has loved this movie for years. The quirky characters who live in Venice, CA provide lots of laughs and good lines to quote. We watch it every Christmas! Our old VHS version has given way to a DVD and we'll watch it again next year."
4,This is my new Christmas film to watch every year. Great ensemble cast.,"Was not sure what this would be like, but as I'd lived in LA for several years, spent quite a bit of time at Venice Beach, so I NetFlixed it, and was very glad I did. Then I ordered it from Amazon.com.This is a very enjoyable film, with some of my favorite actors, so what's not for me to like? I also ordered three of these for three friends for a surprise Xmas gift this year, 2009. They SAID...they also enjoyed this as well. Good."
4,Mixed Nuts,"This a wonderful bit of Christmas humor. Wrapped around all of the possible routine difficulties (eviction, unemployment, pregnancy, gender identification, perversion, legal, use of handguns) in an unlikely setting, it is indeed enjoyable. We first saw this film in the late 90's, and have also acquired a CD of songs from the show. We will watch it again next Christmas!"
3,i've been waiting all my life for steve martin to dye his hair,"Mixed nuts, that's what these people are who are forced together on a very strange xmas eve. This film may not be the best flick, but it sure does make me laugh. Steve Martin hasn't lost his touch."
5,mixed Nuts is nuts!,"I love this movie. It's just so busy. There are all these little story lines that all mix together in a group of people, that are just a mess, looking for the silver lining in their own personal dark clouds, and hoping to find a little happiness on Christmas eve. Plus, there's a killer on the loose to go along with all that craziness. It's a fun movie, and there really is a moral to the whole thing if you stick it out to the end!"
3,strange but funny,"Mixed Nuts is one of the oddest movies I have ever seen. Although it does have its funny parts most of it is just a stupid plot. Basically, it is an okay movie, but I wouldn't reccomend it."
1,Despite all the right ingredients...tastes terrible!,"Quite simply one of the least funny comedies I have seen. The cast alone should ensure that it at least raises a giggle if not a belly laugh, however it just isn't there.The only movie I have ever turned off three quarters of the way through. I think that pretty much sums it up."
3,"Mixed Nuts, Mixed Movie","I thought this move was very funny, and very quirky, but at times it dragged a little. The most fun part, for me, was seeing the amazin cast- Steve Martin, Rita Wilson, Juliette Lewis, Anthony LaPaglia, Liev Schreiber, Adam Sandler, Adam Arkin, Parker Posey, etc. It's so many great people in one little movie! Overall, this movie is good times."
5,Mixed Nuts,"Except for how difficult it was to get ordered.,I love the movie and wish everyone could see it.Everything beautiful about it, cast. location,humor, life, etc.Although this is my favorite new Christmas flick I'd watch anytime of year."
3,A flawed yet worthwhile Xmas Classic.,"Mixed Nuts is one of those movies that actually suffers from an all-star lineup. With a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers, it would shine as a fun little indie film. But with the comedic talents of Martin, Shandling, Kahn, Sanders, and others, you can't help but wonder why the movie isn't funnier. All complaints aside, it is a good film, as there are countless laughs throughout. But these moments are mostly due to the excellent performances by all (with Liev Schreiber stealing the show in what could have been a very cliche role), rather than the script itself, which seems to be uncomfortable with being a dark comedy, and continuously attempts to redeem itself with sappy couplings and a typical Kapra-esque happy ending. It may not make your list of Holiday Must-See films, but if you aren't expecting a miracle, you should come away happy."
3,An ok XMAS Movie,"I think that this movie is alright. Granted, you have to be into christmassy movies and plots and not a lot of thinking in a movie. this movie is just a pop it in and unwind. Don't expect a fantastic blockbuster and you should enjoy it."
4,Thank you Nora,"I have no idea why ""critics"" didn't like this movie. Pardon the pun, but Mixed Nuts is nutty! Best of all it makes me laugh, so what more could you want. Madeline Kahn was a pure jewel and I miss her. Her Blanche Munchnik cracks me up as do the rest of the cast. Thank you Nora! Thank you for making me laugh. When I'm feeling low, I'll just put Mixed Nuts on!"
1,Beyond Dreadful,"If I didn't have fast forward, I couldn't have made it through to the end.They got some big name stars and some that never were to do absolutely nothing for 138 minutes. They made a total fool out of Adam Sandler. Gary Shandling had no purpose whatsoever. Steve Martin could have mailed in his performance. What was Rita Wilson doing? Madeleine Kahn was stuck in an elevator. Robert Klein was walking some dogs. The beautiful Juliette Lewis simulated a pregnant women. The themes were Christmas in L.A. and a suicide prevention clinic. Can you say comedy. Nora Ephron destroyed her writng career here. This ""movie"" is one big mess. If I paid for it, I would want twice my money back. These people weren't nuts, they were interminably boring."
5,My all time favorite!,Classic Christmas-Spirit movie. Love it start to finish. Quite comical and definitely a seasonal favorite! This is my third copy; keep wearing them out!
4,A gem of a sleeper,"A masterfully made movie. What makes this slapstick work so well is its restrained, low key pacing. A more energetic pace would have ruined it. The professional critics seem to confuse its slow pace with dreariness, but they just don't get it. True, the characters are melancholy throughout, but that's understandable given the movie's premise. Understated slapstick? Yes. It's hard to market it as an Xmas movie, since it isn't upbeat, but it will bring a wry smile to your face at any time of the year. Great performances all around. The songs in the soundtrack are wonderful! The elegant pacing shows the brilliance of the movie's makers. Well worth buying at the Amazon.com price."
5,My favorite Christmas movie,"Steve Martin heads a cast of very talented actors in this holiday film that has trublems, funny situations, anxious outbursts and eccentric personalities that seem to fit perfectly in Venice Beach CA. But, I'd have to say Liev Schreiber steals the show in a dance routine that will stay in your mind, the next time you see him ""Wolverine"" or ""CSI"". He's NOT to be missed! This movie may remind you of fruitcakes of Christmas past, as well. If California could re-write ""It's A Wonderful Life"", this is as close as it would come without nonexistence of the main character.Enjoy!"
4,Felix is in the hos-pit-al!,"...I don't wait for Christmas to watch this movie, I get it out whenever I need a laugh.Does anyone else find it frightening how exceptional Liev Schreiber is at acting like a woman? I mean, he's fantastic-much better than some other drag queens I've seen. And he dances so well with those stelletto's.And let's not forget Madeline Kahn as Mrs. Munchnick. I love it when Steve Martin asks ""Chris"", ""have you seen a lady in a really bad mood?""And Rita Wilson as the ever innocent yet seductive Katherine (or is it Catherine?)If you have ever had to answer the phone in the name of customer service, you will love this movie. If you find death funny, you will love this movie. If you love anything by Mel Brooks, you will love this movie. Get it for the holidays, enjoy it. Trust me."
4,Watch and enjoy with your romantic partner!,"Some say this movie could have been better. I say ""humbug""! This movie will fill you with the Christmas spirit no matter when you watch it and when you do you might want to watch it with a romantic partner because when the movie is over love and romance will take over the both of you!!! So before the movie starts break out the Egg-nog, a cozy comforter, cushy pillows and ENJOY! HOHOHOHO and Merry Christmas everyone!"
2,More embarassing than funny,"Nora Ephron usually writes entertaining movies (she wrote this one with her sister Delia) and Steve Martin usually picks good movies to star in. With this in mind, ""Mixed Nuts"" is surprisingly bad. It's a farce without any good jokes, filled with characters that are annoying rather than funny. The Ephrones apparently find it hilarious when people sing with funny voices, and both Madeline Kahn and Adam Sandler embarrass themselves doing it in several scenes that completely fails to be funny. It's a shame a good cast was wasted on a script that should never have been greenlighted. Don't waste your money."
4,Seems like a well built filter!,Seems nicely made...the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the fact that it didn't sit 100% flush in the airbox housing.I will look into other filters next time!
5,Great Sounds--Love the Voice.,"This British Pop-newcomer has a great future, his songs are great. Unfortunately his albume is not available in the US yet, but it's great!"
3,This is okay if you like popish soul like that red headed,"guy, Rick Astley (?) I really liked his voice, it's a really sweet song to but there isn't much for a listener to go by... So it's 3 stars till he comes out with another song."
5,A Great War Story,"When war is declared, Mrs. Kohn decides that Berlin is not a good environment for he teenage daughter, Marianne, so she sends her on a ship that helps smuggle Jewish Refugees over into Liverpool, England into safety, but, parents were not allowed to go. Of course, Marianne did not want to leave her beloved mother to go to a foreign country. She couldn't even speak English! But Marianne has no choice. In Liverpool she is moved from foster family until finally she settles into a home. Will Marianne ever see her dear mother again? Read the book to see."
2,"Beautiful, but...","I loved the ring. It's beautiful, but after wearing it for only a few hours I got a nice green ring around my finger...making me feel like it's not really sterling silver. I'd hesitate to buy again."
2,Ring size,"I recived the ring with no problems, but was disappionted with the actual size of the Knot emblem. Would have liked it a bit bigger."
4,Very Interesting,"The book itself, was very interesting. It really applies to Oregon. I am going to Oregon State Uni & taking geo 380 don't really use the book if you go to class. Don't need this book for class."
3,Not bad.,"This album of Havoc, (the mouthpiece), & Prode'je is good. Not their best stuff but is totally hardcore. Pretty cool, check it out."
5,"HIV sourcebook, an excellent source","This book is comprehensive and clear for both the Chinese Medical practitioner, and for the HIV patient.Misha Cohen has done amazing work and research with HIV and Chinese Medicine, and we are fortunate to have this information neatly organized and at our fingertips."
4,it's all in the urns,"this book contains text and black/white plates. There is lots of text dealing with the various stages of the wedding in ancient Greece. The primary focus of the book is decoding the rituals depicted on various wedding urns. This books only fault is its organization. It would have been nice to have the text and plates incorporated into one another, versus the tedious separation that exists"
4,"Great, but Revelations are Confusing","Clock Without Hands is another fine example of McCullers' ability to quietly yet intensely probe into the mystery of the human psyche. Her work reminds me of Tennessee Williams at times. This novel deals with an old judge, his grandson and the presence of his dead son, a young Black man, and a pharmacist who is dying of leukemia. There is a revelation near the end of the story concerning the link between most of the characters, but it seems odd considering the Judge's personality and value systems. The last chapter, however, which concerns the pharmacist's worsening illness, is transcendant. An uneven McCullers tale is certainly better than none at all."
2,It Started Leaking,"I had actually purchased this a few months ago to use as a washing machine sediment filter, and it worked great at first. However it started leaking, and we didn't notice it until we found a puddle on the floor. It was leaking around where the clear bowl screwed on. I tried to tighten it up to stop the leak, but as I was tightening it broke. I won't buy another one."
3,Needs a little help,"I bought this for a laundry tub in the basement that gets it's water before any softener or conditioner (that is, untreated). It does filter quite well. I also had leakage problems as others did. I wrapped the threads with Teflon tape and stopped all leaking. Obviously the threads on the filter are undersized. Having done that, I am satisfied."
2,Leaks,"Works fine if you don't mind 5% of the water leaking out. Also no accompanying instructions and it cracks easily if you tighten hard trying to stop the leaking. Mine cracked and I had to shave and sand the clear male end to reduce the leaking. Just to clarify, it leaked before it cracked. Other than that, it filters effectively, cleans easily and probably deserves 2 1/2 stars. I would have returned it but couldn't find another similar product on the market."
3,Good album,"I don't listen to this that much anymore but it used to be my favorite album. It has some good songs that carry good messages. The best songs are Creep, Kick Your Game, Red Light Special, and Waterfalls. Check it out!"
3,Scrub is the best song,"I think they are good singers and they have some good songs but I think it would be nice if they would clean up some of their words but it""s good they feel so strongly about what they choose to sing about it just needs to be cleaner."
1,merely okay..........,"tlc's second cd- um sounds okay..better than ""fanmail""....I like the ballads, ""red light special"" and ""take our time"".'Creep"" is tight eventhough it was overplayed and Tionne's voice seems to fall out. Canted wiat until the next cd."
1,Not badd,"This is probably ""TLC's"" worst ablum. There are good songs like ""Water Falls"", ""Creep"", ""Diggin' on you"" and ""Kick some game"". Basically it's the songs that were released as singles, that were good. With an exception to ""Red Light Special"".The rest of the songs haven't been produced enough. They are way too flacid, and frankley unecessary. Especially ""Girlfriend"", which is a ""Prince"" remake. It'll grown on you for a while.But the feeling isn't lasting."
5,TLC IS THE BOMB,"TLC is my favorite girl group of all tme. They are my role models( besides J.Lo, Beyonce and Brandy). If you don't have this Cd, then you don't like music, period.Intro: I usaully skip thisCreep: CLAASSIIC. This song is still fly after all these yearsCase of the Fake People: Not my favoriteDiggin On You: this is such a cute song, and T-Boz's voice is so prettyKick your Game: AIIHTInterleude: T-Boz is having a conversation with P.Diddy about The meaning of CRAZYSEXYCOOLRED light Special: A Naughty song, its about a girl who is ready to get it on with her man.Waterfalls: Who hasn't heard this? A very insporational songI'll skip over a few tracks to get to "" Take Our Time"". Listen to that song with your man or woman and it will surely put you in the mood."
5,Flashback!,"I hadn't heard this album since I was about 13...I'm not sure what made me want to get it again, but I'm glad I did. Took me right back to when I was a kid."
5,You don't have this? What are you waiting for??,"TLC's second album was their biggest seller and it was the final album that entirely featured the late Left Eye Lopes. When she tragically passed away in 2002, her death was rightly mourned by fans all over. She was a fiesty woman with a tough soul and an independent spirit. She could teach that arrogant rag Alanis a thing or two! Anyway, this record is amazing. Buy now or risk ridicule!"
4,Girl Power,"Let's revisit 1994 ... you had En Vogue, Salt N Pepa, TLC and Mary J. Blige.This was THE time that black women in music were trumpeting girl power, independence, assertiveness and demanding respect from their men (LOL)!!!Before Destiny's Child glossy girl power antics and Lil Kim's post-modern feminism, TLC's CrazySexyCool was absolutely trailblazing in girls singing about sex (albeit safe sex), manipulating relationships and using men as play things the way some men had previously used women.The material sounds dated and indistinctive now because of everything that's changed in music b/c of albums like this one, but TLC still has some great, great stuff that takes me back to my junior year in high school.Be on the lookout for ""Creep"", ""Red Light Special,"" ""Kick Your Game"" and ""Waterfalls"" as the album's timeless jams.Most importantly, pay special attention to the lyrics ... you'll appreciate it more when you realize that women weren't singing like this 10 years before.R.I.P. Left Eye."
4,one of the biggest albums of the mid 1990's,"this album was considered a masterpiece at the time of it's release. I still like most of the songs on this CD, but case of the fake people was so plain despite the good lyrics, if I was your girlfriend wasn't quite as good as prince's version, take your time is boring but the rest of the songs are really good. Diggin On You has really stood the test of time with its catchy grooves, as well as red light special and waterfalls, which were monster hits on the charts for TLC in 1995, it was their year indeed. This is a classic r&b/hip hop dance CD with soft catchy grooves and is recommended to the kids out there today who need to hear the ladies who were and still are the ruling r&b queen, R.I.P. lefteye, your fans miss you. If you want something more charged with energy and dancy from tlc, check out fanmail, this album is somewhat dancy too, but more like a deep groovy relaxing album than a dance album."
5,"You might disagree with me, but this is TLC's best.","I have all three of TLC's albums, and I have to say this is the best. I think the song ""Take Our Time"" sung by Chilli is very romantic and nothing beats the golden, pulsating beats of ""Red Light Special."" Other favorites are ""Creep,"" ""Switch,"" ""Waterfalls,"" and ""Case of the Fake People."" I relate to that song so much. I'm tired of being betrayed and I'm putting a stop to it."
5,TLC sold 14 MILLION copies of this CD.,"Do you think that 14 million people bought a stinker ?? Not a chance. They ALL knew that this was one of the best CD's ever produced.I agree with Josh Carter's review. No matter what kind of music you like - rock, pop, R&B, hip hop, soul, rap, whatever - no music collection is complete without this CD. Look at the dates on some of the other reviews here on Amazon - 7 YEARS after this CD was released, people are STILL saying that it is one of the best CD's around. That should tell you something.Hey, it's worth buying this CD just to hear T-Boz singing ""Oh I, Oh I, Oh I"" on ""Creep"". VERY crazy, sexy, and cool ......."
4,classic,"another album that should be in everyone's collection. i never thought they had the best voices, but it all just flows together nicely. their lyrics are sometimes deep and sometimes fun and the beats bring alot to the table as well."
5,Holds up,It has been well over a decade since this was released. I hadn't listened to it for a few of those years. Just did. Still terrific. This is silky smooth R&B with a dash of funk and a pinch of hip hop. The production is impeccable and the back up musicians top of the class. In its genre it shares the mountain top.
4,Slow and sensuous,"I fell in love with TLC after hearing the ""Unpretty"" track from ""Fanmail"". I just recently obtained ""CrazySexyCool"", though I had to hunt around a bit for it.The sound of ""CrazySexyCool"" is quite different from ""Fanmail"", which has a much faster, futuristic feel to it. Most of the tracks on the earlier album are slower, with gently synthesised sounds throughout. Although I missed the fast moving Fanmail songs, I actually found myself liking a lot of the CrazySexyCool songs better. Many of them are quite powerful, and full of imagery. ""Diggin' on You"" is lively, and uplifting. ""Red Light Special"" is beautiful and sensuous, while ""Somethin' Wicked"" is darkly moving.And the interlude, ""Sexy"" is delightfully stupid."
4,my fave by them,this album to me represents them better than the others it has much more style and substance.the album musically is a cross between Babyface &prince.yet with there flavor to ride the grooves and tempo which they do so well.they make the title a way of life on this album.good production and styling.
5,"One of the ten best ""start-to-finish"" CD's ever.","As a ""whiteboy"" who usually digs on Mellencamp, Meatloaf, Pearl Jam,Springsteen, and Rod Stewart, this CD is PHENOMENAL! I heard ""Creep"" on an MTV compilation so I bought the CD at a used CD store. WOW! EVERY track is solid! My favorite has to be whichever one I am listening to at the moment you ask me. The first ten tracks are especially s-o-l-i-d! Having the J-Dupri et al do cameos makes the CD even more exciting.(especially on Kick a little game) As I listened to ""Red Light Special"", I felt it reminded me of ""Whip Appeal"" by Babyface. Sure enough, I checked the credits and lo and behold, he wrote the song and produced it. This CD is a masterpiece. Though I bought it used, it would be a bargain at $20, no bulls**t!"
5,Classic Hip-Hop meets R&B,"What a classic CD this is; for anyone who loves hip hop, R&B and rap I think it's safe to say this is its intersection. I remember owning this as a casette in middle school and playing it until the tape broke!"
5,Best Hooks for Suspended Ceilings,These are a much better than the ones I found in the local store that have to be bent to make them fit.
4,good hook,It works well on a suspended ceiling track but would be better if thehook had a larger opening and space for hanging an object.
4,Perfect Quiet Storm!,"Toni Braxton is super sexy and with an equally seductive voice. Her debut was a perfect introduction to the R&B; world. While I think Secrets is her best work Toni Braxton is also impressive.Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again are super hits. Enough said. Love Affair, Seven Whole Days, Love Shoulda Brought you Home and my fav You Mean the World to Me are all highlights.The reason I rated this 4 stars is the other songs are okay I guess but I usually skip. The Cd can get moody and depressing without a true uptempo song.If your looking for Classic Toni look at Secrets!"
4,SHES 2ND ON MY LIST,"THIS ALBUM CAME AT A TIME WHEN MY ORIGNAL DIVA ANITA BAKER WAS OFF MAKING BABIES ,SO ITS JUST WHAT I NEEDED AND SHE CAME THROUGH.HOW MANY WAYS /CANDLELIGHT ,AND THEN HER NICE SILKY VOICE KEPT ME FOLLOWING HER TO HER OTHER ALBUMS THIS IS A MUST HAVE"
3,Toni the Hottie,"I dont remember when Toni first released her debut album. I think it was about 10 years ago. I was mesmerised by her looks, voice and the songs she sang. Every song is sung with a deep feeling. At times she reminds me of Whitney Houston. You mean the world to me, Another sad love song and Breath again are my favorites. I havent heard the rest of the album though. Try it if you wish to."
5,Another genius trait of Woody,"Well. I admire Woody Allen as a Movie director,writter and Actor.This CD, is really ""different"" in the sense of the type of song, rhythm and his particular interpretation style. Just another positive aspect of ""Woody"""
5,Best Edinburgh DVD out there!,"This is the best Edinburgh DVD available! It is a great souvenir! I went to Edinburgh a couple months ago, and then purchased this DVD a couple weeks ago. I love it! It's informative and shows much of Edinburgh."
2,What a whiner!,"A pretty annoyjng whiny book about industrial design. The seven stages of action: forming the goal, forming the intention, specifying the action, executing the action, perceiving the state of the world, interpreting the state of the world, evaluating the outcome. All these are done with every action done by humans."
5,Primer for a language of product design,"A fun book that might open your eyes to things usually taken for granted. My copy of the book was actually bound with the spine on the opposite side of the book which was a bit awkward but was a lesson in the spirit of the book. (I have never seen another copy bound the same way, so it might have been an accident.) I return to the book whenever I think I am stuck in habitual thinking about objects and processes."
5,Sigmund is back.,"This is a great dvd, and Rhino did a much better job than with the H.r Pufnstuf dvd. These episodes are funny and represent the series well. The menu is very easy to navigate, and the picture looks great. My favorite characters are Burp and Slurp, and they're at their funniest here. The interview is very funny, and there's even an advertisement for a submarine ride. Pick it up today, you'll be glad you did!"
5,a classic,This is a great show cheesy but good this is the only Kroft show that I like more then H.R. Pufnstuf! Its worth the wait!
4,"Kind of ricketty, but works fine","It does the job! It's a little ricketty, but it works.It is made out of chrome colored plastic, not chrome.The title of the product is a little misleading."
2,An historical curiosity,"This biography of Anne of Austria has all the benefits and drawbacks of the period in which it was written. It is lengthy and detailed, but depicts Louis XIII and Richelieu not as real people but caricatures. About its subject, Queen Anne, it is curiously ambivalent. On the one hand it constantly asks for pity for her unhappy life (apparently because she was blonde and blue eyed and cried a lot - at least that's the impression I was left with). On the other hand, it is quite harsh about her degree of involvement in the Chalais conspiracy and others, not hesitating to label her activities as treasonous. In its hurry to get to Buckingham it condenses the years 1617-25 into one chapter and thus obliterates the three years in which Anne and Louis were very much in love. I don't know whether this is unwitting or done because it doesn't fit the unremittingly bleak picture being painted. In short: interesting for anecdotes but not very useful for interpretation."
5,August 10 will be the happiest day of my life!!!!!!,Sailor Moon R: The Movie is by FAR the best of the 3 movies! And the best of any movie ever created! I can't wait till Aug. 10! It's a good thing Pioneer or whoever's not changin anything b/c it's PERFECT the way it is. Thank you SO much for Sailor Moon Naoko!
3,Why did Pioneer do this? the dubbed DBZ movies were fine.,"WARNING! WARNING! Atempted series continuity - if you are going to bring the dub down to DiC's level at least get the Senshi's DiC attacks right! I know Pioneer was doing series continuity and understood (it usually raises sales) but this was so much worst than DiC, there were added lines where lines weren't needed and a bunch of changed lines (more than is to be expected from translation and too much/lack of speaking time in English). I for one will not be buying S and SS the dub as I did the subtitled versions -those I could watch again and again.PS my ears are still burning from the worst than usual banter between Rini and Serena - Chibi-Usa is writhering in humiliation in the anime."
2,Sailor Moon R was a disappointment,"Sailor Moon R did have a better storyline than the S movie, but it was still just as disappointing the storyline was all right but needed something more. Sailor Moon R as a whole was a little wishy washy in my opinion and needed some more gut behind it."
1,Good but not the best!,"I have seen both versions at my friends house and I own the dub. In my words, the viewer from Michigan has no clue what he's talking about! On the sub you waste all your time trying to read what they said! He neads to get some sence nocked in him and also get some respect for our Sailors! In other words, it's good but the dub is WAY better!"
2,NOT FOR KIDS!!!!! DEFINATELY NOT!!! ADULT MOVIE!!!,"I absolutely LOVE Sailor Moon and so do my children. We all watch the first four seasons over and over again. I watched the fifth season by myself because it has lots of language , nudity, and other stuff not for kids. It's like there are two different types of Sailor Moon the ones for kids like the first four seasons and the dream hole movie and the adult ones like the fifth season Sailor Moon Stars, The rose movie, the ice queen movie, and Sailor and the 7 ballz part one and two (which i do not recommend the ballz one since there is kinky sex, lesbianism, and other raunchy stuff) The reason this movie is not for kids is because the little rose creature is a nude woman and Fiore one of Darien,s friends is in love with him. That means that it is introducing homosexuality. I do not recommend this to anyone under thirteen."
1,"If I could, I would give it a negative score.","This anime is one of the worst displays of fluff that I have ever seen in my life. Completely inane in its plot and characterizations, Sailor Moon R was incredibly draining in its frequent and blatant stupidity. The only thing that did surprise me was how 5 complete ditzes could ever manage to form coherent words from their idled heads much less save the world. An utter waste of time."
2,Sailor Moon R - The Movie: The Promise Of The Rose,I have the Japanese version and loved it but since I'm English I went out and got the dubbed version and was disappointed. The translation was not that great and the sound quality was terrible. The store I got it from no longer has the video so I can't exchange it. Now I'm stuck with a poor quality video by Pioneer.
2,English dubing ruined the show,"I bought the non-dubed version of this movie first and then since I was so impressed went and bought the english version as well, only to find that while changing the language they changed the content. All of the great music was eliminated and replaced by old english songs and also the content of some of the lines that were meant to be funny but were obviously seen as too provacative for Americans were changed. By downgrading the film it isn't made safer its made less entertaining. Go for the subtitled and avoid the english."
1,"Great Movie, Ridiculous Price.","^^^ Like I said.Look, I love the movie as much as anybody else. But when I first bought the movie years ago, it didn't cost nearly as much as these punks are trying to sell it for.Don't buy it (that was both a metaphor and a serious request)."
5,SAILORMOON R IS THE BEST MOVIE!,Oh my gosh! This movie is so good. I'm a Sailor Moon FANATIC! I love S.M. but I've always wondered about Darien's past. This movie describes that along with new villians. It is great with only mild violence and romance. It is really more about being loyal and true to your friends to the end.
5,Read this!,"The current VHS Dupped version is the cut version, 3 and up. The DVD is the uncut version. Support Sailor Moon by buying the cut version anyway if possible. Hopefully they will release the dubbed uncut on VHS soon."
2,Poor Voice Acting,"I am used to the DIC voices. I was very happy when I found out Teri Hawkes was coming back as Sailor Moon. That is until I seen Pioneers new Dubbed movie. Its obvious that Teri and all the other voices in the show have not done this for awhile. They were terrible. I think Amy and Luna were pretty good, but everyone else, I""m sorry but they need to practice some more. I know Teri can do WAY better on Sailor Moon than in this movie. Sailor Moon sounded to proud, not enough emotion put into it. Also in this movie, there was way too much chessy lines. Especially when Chibi Usa says Moon Mama. Come on pioneer you can do better than this!"
3,Cool,My sister and I saw this movie (she's 10) and we both like it. It was pretty fun and so bright and cheerful.I'd recommend this for anyone who likes anime ^.~ . (It's more girlie by the way).
5,'tis moon revenge!,"BUY THIS!! It is my favorite Sailor Moon movie . . . and probably one of my favorite movies of all time! A note of caution, however . . . DO NOT GET THE DUBBED. The subtitled edition is *so* much better. In this movie, we learn a bit about Mamo-chan's past, and we meet Fiore-- one of the best Sailor Moon characters, in my opinion -- who is an alien who has been brainwashed by kisenian, the evil flower chick -_- . . . she's mean. Anyways, please buy this to see for yerself, and remember . . . SUBBIES! Fiore is a much better character in the original (I think he's done by Hikaru Midorikawa, or something . . . but he's done really well, anyways) and the relationship between him and Mamoru is sweeter, too (I think it's one-way love!). The dubbed made everything worse -- especially the grooooovy song, Moon Revenge . . . well, just buy it! Pleeeease?!"
2,Sailor Moon R The Promise of the Rose Review,"I would give it 1 and a half if I could. I know a lot of people like this movie best of the three but I couldn't stand it! It was just plain old CORNY! The end was the worst part. And when they teleport into space, how the heck are they breathing? The story of this movie stunk. I gave it two stars because I didn't waste my money on nothing. and I gave it that ONE extra star just because it is Sailor Moon."
2,The Butchering of R,"This dub was absolutely terrible. The voice actors that Pioneer found were terrible, only one of the four they found fit with the character. They changed the plot: making Fiore a willing accomplice to the Kisinean flower instead of a pawn of her, a lot of the friendship aspects of it were removed, and the mildest of violence and nudity was cut. They butchered a beautiful story, my favorite of the movies, and made me detest it."
4,Sailor Moon R,"Ok I just want to say first hand that I loved this movie. The dubbers didn't hack it to pieces as expected and the voice acters brought real emotion to their characters and the movie in general. The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I like the song ""Power of Love"" but let's face it, it's plaguerism to use it twice(it was used in the end episode of Sailor Moon R series), plus ""Moon Revenge"" was an awesome song! The other reason is that at the end scene when Sailor Moon is revived it doesn't have the same emotional angst that the Japanese version has. But, besides this I'd recommend the movie to anyone."
5,"This movie totally rocks, dude!",I love this movie. The end actually made me cry. It's soooo sweet. You have to see it!
2,If your really desperate...,"Don't buy it, unless you are really bored. Voices are not any good, especially since they kept most of the original ones. Sailor Moon is just as annoying as ever, her cry baby ways gets on my nerves. Although, I will say this. They didn't do to bad with the vilian. Please, don't waste your money on this, if you can borrow it. And especially don't waste your money on the VHS tape."
1,Sailor Moon says don't get the movie dubbed!,"Don't Get this movie dubbed! trust me! its worst than the DiC version. I saw this movie at my friends and it was awful! So many lines were changed and replaced with corny dialoge. It had horrible voice actors, Luna sounds atleast 40 years old Usagi/searna sounds 30. Attacks were changed. In the Japanese version they have good voices. If your a true sailor moon fan you'll get the subtitled. You'll never get to experience the japanese version if you don't get subtitles. You'll go on thinking DiC did a good job. If you get dubbed you won't get to here how Usagi really sounds. So much is edited it makes no sence. Don't get this movie dubbed! I'm warning you, don't get this movie dubbed!(in fact don't get any anime dubbed) You'll be sorry if you did. Trust me on this one."
2,PARENTS BEWARE,"I got this movie hoping that it wouldn't be as crude as the japanese version. PARENTS BEWARE! THERE IS NUDITY IN THIS MOVIE! I would not recommend this movie for children under 13! The movie was pretty good, except for the nudity! I'm very dissapointed, and I'M NOT A CHILD!"
1,"My poor, poor ears!","I recently viewed the English dubbed version of the Sailor Moon R movie - and I regret that I did. It wasn't the storyline and it wasn't the animation. Both of those were first rate. It was those terrible voice actors! Gracious, but when I first heard the intro, Terri Hawkes (as the voice of Sailor Moon/Serena) practically deafened me. Also, all of the voices sounded particularly strained as though they were trying really hard not to screw up since they obviously haven't worked in a while. Of course, many of the lines were corny and unnecessary. One scene had Rini calling Serena ""Moon Momma"". If that doesn't induce nausea, nothing will! Another scene replaces Usagi's ""Tuxedo Kamen-sama!"" with ""The man can wear a cape! Woo!"" The movie also put too much emphasis on friendship and not enough on love. My advice is to buy the subtitled version if you really want to see it done right. If you're a person who prefers dubbed, still buy it. Pioneer's dubbing faired much better than DiC's."
2,I hate reading subtitle,I hate reading subtiltle too. Most of everyone like to listen to the English not reading the subtitle. How can you read while watching it? If you read you will miss the action.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!,"The first thing I want to say is that this version of dubbed was barnified. It was a major disappointment. Almost every translation was wrong. The title of the movie is good. The music didn't go with the movie. Sailor Moon's voice acting was bad. They even put in extra conversations which wasn't necessary. The story-line was mostly wrong. The sub-titiled is so much better. If anyone who wants to see a Sailor Moon movie or the series, don't start off with this version of Sailor Moon or else you'll end up hating it. Sailor Moon is really good, but not the dubbed movie. I really hope they do better on the next two movies."
1,Warning: Don't Buy!,"I have seen the full English dub of Sailor Moon R. IT IS AWFUL! The lines are way different, the msic is all messed up and edited in the wrong places. I found no interest in this video. I own all 4 movies (Sailor Moon R Dub, Sailor Moon R, Sailor Moon S, and Sailor Moon SuperS) and the dub was the worst. The beutiful Japanese music was taken out and they didn't even give the original theme song. Pioneer really messed this one up...I expected better..."
3,To Dub or Not to Dub?,"The dubbed version of Sailor Moon R is sort of disappointing to me, as I've seen the subtitled version first. I expected the cuts that they made, and the changes in dialogue, but I feel that Pioneer did this film's viewers a disservice by changing the soundtrack's music so much. The original music was much more effective than DiC's needle-drop canned music used here. Also, ""The Power of Love"" is obviously too short to replace ""Moon Revenge"", as you can notice that they had to repeat the song's opening verse again. Also, the actor doing Artemis's voice is terrible! I laughed every time he spoke, because he sounds so goofy! If you liked the Cartoon network's version of the series, and haven't seen the sub, then maybe you'll like this better than I did. (This version is better for kids, though, as they don't have to read the subtitles here.)"
4,An Great Movie,"I think this movie is super!The only eception is that it has a lot more violence then the other two movies,even though they edited it.I would probably recommend this to kids 7 and up.If you don't have this one,or the other two,don't just sit there!Go out and look for the dubbed versions[for kids],and the subtitled versions[for much older kids]. :)"
5,The Best Dubbed Sailor Moon Movie In The Trilogy,"This was the best Sailor Moon movie in the trilogy--definitely!! Fiore was a little creepy, but the plot was wonderful. ""Power of Love"" is THE best English Sailor Moon song. An absolute must!"
5,Very good - not much like the NA Series,"My family recently purchased the movie from a different company, and we liked it so much, we're buying the other two! This is an excellent lovestory, and the English translation of ""Moon Revenge!"" is beautiful - I'm glad I got it subbed, not dubbed. There -are- a couple of questionable parts, but the movie is very humorous and sweet. All in all, a definite keeper!"
1,The worst dub i have ever seen,"The original subtitled movie was excellent. The dub was horrible. The voices were awful, the dialog was chopped up and americanized, and the music was from DIC. I hated this dub. It was a mutilation of a wonderful movie. I suggest that if anyone wants to purchase the SMR movie, to head on over to the subtitled one. It's so beautiful, sad, and just plain excellent. Do not waste your time or money on this dub."
1,What did you do?,"Here's my second review. Well I just looked back on my dub, after you've seen the uncut, I couldn't stand it! It was like was watching a DiC movie. I couldn't believe they even cut out the 18 seconds that Serena was unconcius for! What was wrong with that? Here's my advice for Pioneer, Sailormoon was for the teenage and adult audiences and just keep it that way."
1,Eeewww...,"If you are one of those people who think DiC is a good company because they brought Sailormoon to America and so what if they edited out practically everything, it was for little kids blah blah blah... then you will LOVE this movie. Songs repeating because they aren't long enough to fit in the original's place, Dialogue dumbed down to a three year old's level with such things as ""moon mama"" and ""wicked weed indeed"", gotta LOVE that bad voice acting, too. God, I hate to think what the S movie will be like... If your a fan of the Japanese version (like me) STAY AWAY! this movie is scary. Terri Hawkes has the most ANNOYING voice on the planet. All she can do is scream like a wounded animal and say ""wicked cool"". Suprisingly, they didn't actually cut much. Only one or two scenes. Please, don't pay for this movie. Go buy the subtitled version, then maybe watch this on cartoon network."
5,A Wonderful Movie!,"Both the sub and the dub are great! Even though I THINK Pioneer used the same voice actresses as DiC did, they did a slightly better job than the reg. episodes.Things that displeased me are: 1. In the dub, they used ""Power of Love"" again, where they used it already in the episode against wiseman. 2. Dubbing was a bit off. Especially when the Senshi had flashbacks about how Usagi brought them together. They were supposed to say ""Usagi"", instead they said different things.But there are good things, too. First of all, the dub was not cut off much at all! A lot better than I had thought. Second, the sales rating for the dub is obviously beyond what I imagined! 12? That's REALLY good. I'm sure it was higher than that when I wasn't looking! and Third, it's in English, most importantly.I would recommand ages 10 and up for the SUB and under 10 for the DUB. Either way, you gotta get one or both!"
5,It is one of the best movies ever made!!!,"I swear to you, even if you don't generally like anime, see or buy this movie! It has a little bit of every genre in it, comedy, action, drama... the list goes on and on!! It is so beautiful, and that is why I originally got hooked on sailormoon in the first place! IT IS A MUST TO HAVE!! To support it, I am buying it as soon as it comes out.(even though I already have it!!)"
2,don't know what people see in it,"I've been told by several of my friends that this is an excellent movie, well i saw 2 seasons and hated them,but i was told that this was different. It wasn't, it was the same old washed up storylines and poor writing. Sailor Moon isn't a quality anime, it has neither the interesting charachters and interactions that have kept Inuyasha from falling into the 2 or 3 star range, nor the brilliant writing that make Fullmetal Alchemist and Cowboy Bebop some of the best examples of modern anime. skip this, theres nothing remarkable here."
1,Death to all Dubs!,"Don't think I'm just a dub hater, but this has to be the absolute worst rendition they could have possibly made of the Sailor Moon R movie. I must have seen the Japanese version a thousand times before I purchased this video, and it ruined me. Rini's overabundant use of the word ""Mama"" was absolutely annoying. Not only did the makers change most of the content from a Japanese to an English oriented format, but they weren't consistent with uses of the attacks, nicknames for people, etc. For instance, what was ""Moon Princess Halation"" in Japanese and ""Moon Sceptor Activation"" in English (during the series) now has become ""Moon Princess Elimination."" Good grief! If you want a quality video, just check out the Japanese version. You'll be much more satisfied..."
2,Warning,"I had to say I was quite disappointed with the English Sailor Moon R movie. I've seen both the english version and the japanese one and I believe the japanese is better. For one thing there were way to many puns in the american one. Also Fiore, a villain, has the same voice as Chad(that should say something). in the japanese one he has one that suits his character. Also the chibi serena sounds like a Care Bear. In the japanese one she has the most adorable voice. But they also trashed the most tender scene at the end when Sailor Moon said ""Mamoru (darien), Minna (Everyone) I told you i wouldn't let anyone be alone (well something like that I don't have the exact words, but it was sweet.) So I reccomend you either see this before the japanese one. Or just buy the japanese one with subtitles, your not missing much"
2,Not THAT Great.,"I would definetly say the TV series is better than this movie. I haven't seen the other movies yet, but I hope they are better than this one. The story has barely any plot at all, and one of the ""bad guys"" looks familiar... Can you guess who it looks like? (I'll give you a hint- it starts with an ""A"".) Anyway, I would definetly recommend this to younger people."
2,Ick,"Alright, I see that if you have only seen the dub before, you might enjoy this movie. But if you're like me, and have already seen the three movies in Japanese or the series to that matter this movie will suck eggs. There is dialogue that should not be there, unnecessary dialogue (one of the most stupid is when Mamoru stops Fiore with his cane, Usagi or dubbed Serena says ""Be careful my masked man"" in this horrible sugar-sweet voice).It's expected that the homo-sexual references would be edited, it is dubbed for a 4-12 audience, but well, it wasn't as good as it could have been, which could have been much, much better. The only good thing about this is that the USA has made Sailormoon more available to Americans that are not able to see the original series, which might open up for future dubbing for other anime."
4,"A Good Effort, with Some Questionable Dialogue Changes","This is the best of the 3 Sailor Moon movies based on the hit series. However, the translators of this Pioneer production seem to have forgotten to upgrade the dialogue to match the more adult, unedited DVD version. For example, Tuxedo Mask is called Sailor Moon's ""best"" or ""special"" friend - not her boyfriend, as is clearly the case. There are also some errors, such as the film's villain, Fiori, referring to the Moon Scepter as the Moon Wand, and some awkward changes in dialogue, with Rini calling Serena ""Moon Mama."" That bit of dialogue sounds more like a pick-up line than something a child would call her mother. However, the balance of the dialogue is well done, and the voices of the characters are reprised by most of the original cast."
4,The Odango-Atama's 1st Movie..,"OK, so... This movie is pretty cool. I know the sub is better, since it's original, and it's not edited and junk.. But I love it anyway! Fiore comes back for his friend, but when he sees Serena and the others around Darien, he gets mad and thinks that Darien's only friend should be him. Friends 4-ever... So he tries to kill everyone, accidentally hurts his buddy, and takes him to make him better. But that witchy Kasennian Blossom keeps trying to take over the alien's thoughts. But... Sailor Moon saves the day(of course... ^_^ ) It has the Power of Love instead of Moon Revenge, but the DiC song is ok... I still think Pioneer should have done the Moon Revenge song."
5,Darien Shields,"Sailor Moon R is the best DVD movie I have ever seen. It has the option to change the language from English to Japanese. The story was good and the best part was at the end when the song ""Moon Revenge"" played throughout the ending. With all the extra bells and whistles, Sailor Moon R for the DVD deserves five stars."
4,DVD Version Definitely The Way To Go!!!,"If you really like Sailor Moon, I strongly recommend you to get the DVD version(s). In the long run, DVD's are cheaper if you want both the English Subbed and the English Dubbed versions. Great Movie, probably the best of the three, although Sailor Moon S Movie comes in a close second. I can't wait until the S and SuperS Seasons come out on DVD."
3,The movie was ok,It was an ok movie 7 and under should not watch it let me warn you that there is nudity in the movie!
3,"SUB is better, but DUB's ok, too.","This movie, Sailor Moon R, is very detailed artistic-wise, but I'm afraid the plot wasn't very well developed. The world is being invaded by some evil flower? Reeni calles Serena, ""Moon Mama?"" Serena says, ""You're so mean!"" to an obviously evil guy? I'm sorry, but the dialogue in the dubbed movie is screwed up. You can't figure out what's going on, and so I say that the subtitled version is better because you can actually follow along without getting confused by the storyline. And what is with the music to the movie! They first have smooth jazz, then classical, then some sort of cha-cha music, and this goes on through the entire movie! But if you just ignore most of all that, and just watch the animation itself, then it's pretty good. I'm hoping that DIC and Pioneer will do a better job on Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon Super S."
1,Buy the dvd version!!!!!!,Ok this movie is bad. . If you like uncut sailor moon like me get the dvd version. Do not get this tape.
2,Sailor Moon in trouble.......,"I watched the japanese version of this video before I watched this one, and thought that DIC did a very bad job with the voices. There were lines left out and when they translated it, there were some stupid lines that they put in that movie. The uncut japanese movie was way better! Should watch that one."
4,My thoughts on the dubbed Sailor Moon R,"This movie has got to be my favorite of the three but the dubbed version does absolutely no justice to the original Japanese version. The dubbed version of this movie is what got me hooked on Japanese animation but since I've seen the subtitled version I think dubbing it made it incredibly, excuse me for lack of a better word, dumb."
5,Wicked KEWL!,Its the best movie... I wish it were longer though. Moon Revenge at the end is a heart stopper... An absolute MUST!
4,Not A Bad Movie.,"Ok, to be honest, I hated that whole thing with the ""Evil Flower"". I thought there could have been a better plot than just a flower controlling this guy. The love story with Serena and Darien wasnt bad either. The movie was awesome, just that the flower thing controlling him, and it being on a big meteor kinda go annoying."
4,"this movie was great, but want subtitled, justinfinity","I happen to own the dubbed and think that it's great, but really want the subtitled. the power of love is a great song, it's my second fave (over My Only Love):o) i've been watching this movie a lot practically every night. BUT REALLY, GET THE SUBTITLED IT SEEMS SO MUCH BETTER! REALLY WANT IT TOO MUCH MONEY!"
1,One Word: HORRID,"The dubbed version of this movie was horrid.. what was Pioneer thinking? I've seen both versions, the dubbed and the subtitled, the subtitled is great, but the translation could've been done A LOT better. The entire meaning of the movie and message was lost with all the corny lines and cliche sayings. This made this movie one of the worst dubbed movies that I have seen. If you want to see a great movie, buy the subtitled version."
2,Some Problems,"I thought this movie was pretty good, especially since they used some of the japanese names, but my favorite part was the opening scene wich had Super Sailor Moon and the Super Sailor Scouts. I think that all viewers should be aware that this movie SHOULD NOT BE RATED 3 AND UP! It should be rated 13 AND UP! There is too much nudity for it to be rated 3 and up! I think that you should give it a second thought, unless you don't mind the nudity. Overall, I thought it was pretty good (at least you don't have to read the subtitles:) But I do not recommend this movie for small children. They really didn't cut anything out. It's quite a bit different from the Dic episodes. I think the song ""The Power Of Love"" is pretty good:)"
5,arigato pioneer...,"The Sailor Moon R Movie is my single favorite work of any of the Sailor Moon series and movies. If you are a fan of the dub as I was a few years ago, you will be delighted by this movie. In the dub series you never get a sense of Usagi's wonderfulness or of how all these girls love each other, but in this movie you really do. Plus, for the boys, see Mars and Jupiter kick some evil flower butt. ^_^"
4,This movie was pretty good.,"I just bought the movie yesterday at SUNCOAST. I watched it and thought it was good. The reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because the scouts got hurt so much but still no blood. Anyway, Moon Revenge was awesome! I have seen this video and the SuperS one too. I am going to buy S later on."
5,This is a great movie!,"I've only seen this movie as a real video (I downloaded it) with English subtitles (but they are WAY to small to read), so I can't wait till it comes out on video and I CAN read the subtitles. This is a great movie, it has a nice plot, a really evil flower, and the spiffiest song in the world (Moon Revenge, all 5 seiyuus sing!). Lots of flashbacks, too. It's a whole lot better subtitled because you get to hear the original voices. Which means no British Ami and Luna, no Jersey Naru, and Chibi-usa doesn't sound so bratty (well...). This is a great video! Do yourself a favor and buy it!"
5,Finally the Sailor Moon series will get its justice!,"I am happy that the 3 Sailor Moon movies are finally coming out and will be uncut. Unfortunatley DiC practically ruined the first 2 Sailor Moon series and given it a bad name, so if you think uncut Sailor Moon is the same way, it's not! I have most of all the series subtitled and its a lot better then the dubbed version. Anyways this movie is cool, even though it's not my favorite out of the three, but I recommend it for anyone who has seen the Japanese Sailor Moon or Americanized version and likes it!"
5,Awesome movie!,"This is the best of the three movies! It's perfect, especially if you've only seen the DiC dubs. And the end is so sweet....."
5,Movie of the Millennium!,"Sailor Moon R (the movie)is the Best Sailor Moon movie of all time! See the Real Sailor Moon as it was meant to be seen. Once you see the real version of Sailor Moon, you will wander what was DIC thinking. Find out how far back Usagi and Mamoru friendship goes. This movie has it all for the true Anime fan. It has Romance,wonderful fighting scenes,and the transformations are just awesome! Once you hear the song 'Moon Revenge' you will be locked in until the very end. A must see for the TRUE Sailor Moon fan."
2,"don't buy this version, buy the Subtitled version!","The sailor moon R movie is the the greatest sailor moon animated thing in existence, but the dubbed version is a travesty. the people responsible cut important/good scenes, changed the dialouge to cover up the slightly homosexual relationship between mamoru and fiore, and overall made the movie very juvenile. This is the greatest movie ever (almost) but do yourself a favor and get the subtitled original!"
3,R is Great somewhat,"I was excited about this dvd, and once I got it i was disappointed. While the picture is great. The sound is only 2 channel Dolby Digital. I have the Japanese Laser disc and I would rather watch that. The dubbing is horrible i would have expected a better job. The extras on the disc are good. Overall it is a must have for a fan. But I hope Pioneer does a better job with the next releases"
2,what!,"This movie........ arrghh! i absolutly loved the Subtitledversion....... The new dubs spit on naoko's genius, and give shame tosailormoon. it is just right for people who just like sailormoon a little, but if you are a passionate SM lover, go with the Japanese version. The dubs were wrong and frankly im very afraid of what they will do about chibimoon. true SM lovers beware............. END"
3,Sailor Moon R,"Although this movie provided lots of information about the anime and was beautifully animated, it is my least favorite of the Sailor Moon movies. It was a little bizarre and contained a lot of fighting, but it had its high points. However I recommend Sailor Moon S and Saior Moon Super S, which I found fantastic. But Sailor Moon R is a must have for any Moonie collector. I wouldn't recommend it for children under 13."
4,Very nice,"Well, if you want my opinion (^_^) I just want to say that i liked this movie. The translation was SOOOO much better than what is normally seen in the DIC TV shows. I wanted the subbed version, but got the dub, and was happy anyway. There are some really weird parts (Moon Mama? ) but all in all, it was very good."
3,I think that the Japanese version was a little better...,"because when they dubbed it into English they added lines that weren't there in the first place. And then to add insult to injury, they changed lines that were reasonable to childish. I liked the movie, but the translations leave a lot to be desired. Please don't do that again."
5,"It's Mooooon Revenge, woo oooooh ^_^","OH MY GOD!!!!!, I can't believe that the Sailor Moon R Movie is going to be on video commercially uncut/unedited! WOW! I've seen this video and in my opinion, it is the BEST out of the three. The moves, comedy scenes, drama scenes, and music are all excellent especially the ending song MOON REVENGE. This is a video that every Sailor Moon fan has to get!!!!!! Trust me you won't regret it ^_^"
5,Absolutly Fantastic!!! Great!!! SUPER!!!!,"I thought that this movie was great! but it would have been better if it were dubbed in english. I noticed that one of the characters looked a bunch like allen from the doom tree seris but he's not. Two words of advice to an anime fan- buy-it a few words of advice to video editing compinies- dub, edit, and sell!!!!!!"
2,Yuck! I couldnt believe it!,"Oh my goodness! This movie is SO bad! I bought it to see what would be different, and I was hoping not much, but its really bad! I think Pioneer should have did a better job with it. At least for the most part, all the dub voice actors are the same..Serena's voice was too loopy, it made me sick! The music was totally different (i.e. no MOON REVENGE) And, on the review, it said that Serena and Darien were best friends! OH PLEASE! LOL. You should buy this movie if you are an fan of the Japanese series, and looking for a good laugh, but if you are hoping that it is somewhat like the Japanese, forget it!"
5,Sailor Moon R -------- rated by Sailor Sunset,"Sailor Moon R is something that i have been waiting a long time for, I am a big sailor moon fan even tough I am 18 years old, Ever since they took the series off before the outer senshi( sailor scouts in english) could be reveled I have been in Sailor Moon Withdrawel Mode . Which is only helped by my monthly Manga of the orginal series.. Any way Sailor Moon R:The Promise of the Rose Is great for Children and the Hard Core Sailor Moon fans who miss the series. It explaines just how and why Darien got his Red Rose and when He and Serena first met. and who his first friend was when he was in the hospital. It has a lot of Action from the first time the Senshi(Scout) Transform till the last scean, If you love Sailor Moon you must get this movieCOSMIC MOON POWER RULZ"
5,SAILORMOON R IS THE BEST!,"sailormoon R movie is the best! I must admit that the plot is not that impressive, but really, do you watch Sailormoon because of its plot? Of course, not! You watch it because of the characters in it. Rei is so sweet to Usagi in the movie; showing just how close their friendship is---contrary to what people say that she hates her. It is shown in the movie how Usagi is very brave when her friends are in danger; proving that she is NOT just a ditz or a crybaby. And Mamoru is totally hot! PEOPLE, YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY, BUY, BUY THIS VIDEO!"
5,Best Movie Of All,"this is the best movie I have seen out of all the Sailor Moon movies. Sailor Moon R is great. I haven't seen it in English, I have seen it in Japanese. It was great. You have to see it if you haven't seen it. Darien's friend comes to pay him a visit, course he is no human. He also wants to get rid of Earth and Sailor Moon. It is great!"
5,The First Sailor Moon Classic in the US.,"Although Pioneer dubbed it into english and cut out all the bumping into walls and blood, and made the flower monsters shout lame things like, ""Attack!"" and all of that...THIS ONE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR IT...I think that this version of Sailor Moon R is one of the most awesome things I have ever seen. I believe that leaving these movies in their orginal forms is all for the best...This movie is highly romantic and it is a good video to watch with your boyfriend...if you can get him to stay put long enough...The sublitles are excellent and it has a good sound track to it. The story is very good also. I think that if you have just seen the english series that you will be surprised by how good Japanese Animation really is...I think everyone needs to have this movie in their Anime library, or start one with this."
4,Great fighting sequence,"I loved the fighting sequence...and especially the ending...it was very touching, the only thing I did not like all that much was the way Mamroru and Sailor Mars were drawn. other than that the ending was worth it!"
4,A great Movie,"I thought that this was one of the best Sailor Moon movies that I've ever seen. Not only did I enjoy it , but my wife and four kids did too. this is one of the best cartoons that has ever been made. It is a great movie to watch with the whole family."
3,Sailor Moon R,"i thought this movie was well done. shure it had it ""corny"" moments. but there were some really cool parts in there. true the villan did look like alan from the doom tree seres. but the story line was very sweet. and yes it doesnt match the orignal story line. but hey. i still think it was good."
4,Sailor Moon R is good,"This was an incredible movie. If you have only seen the dubbed American version of the show you are missing out. It was a little short but it was well worth the money spent. The only reason I withheld that one extra star is because it has ruined me. I don't think I'll ever look at the dubbed version the same way. If you are a Sailormoon fan, this is a definite must have."
3,It's okay.....,"I am a moonie.(person who loves Sailor Moon) I LOVE this movie. I watch it over,and over, and over again. For those poeple who haven't seen the new episodes, I would recomened this movie."
2,Plain disappointment,"I just do not know where to start. I love Sailormoon it's practicaully my infatuation! After I saw this movie I was just so disappointed. I mean the story plot was so how do I put it... hmm... (...) I mean what's up with Darian and Forie's friendship! More like relationship.. I mean they are just (...)!!!!! I cannot believe the story plot! It was just extremely lame... The song was good and everything, I just wish that it wasn't so corny! Plus this moive took out way too many scenes and the dubs were good and everything but (...)... I give it two starts because the plot was way too corny for me to handle... I hope the other moives aren't like this.."
