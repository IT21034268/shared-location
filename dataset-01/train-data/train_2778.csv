2,Neat Concept...but dissapointing,"Neat concept...but disappointing results. Our dog figured this toy out very quickly. I agree with the other poster, it is hard to load the treats, so I do not know how a dog can get them out so quickly. The fun only lasted for at most 2 minutes. She still plays with the blue part of the toy every now and then, just with no treats."
1,"Do Not Purchase, gone in 20 minutes",I spent $25 dollars on this ball to help entertain my 1yr great dane. She is a heavy chewer and needs something to keep her busy. This product claims virtual indestructibility and hours of entertainment. My dog had it completely destroyed on 20 minutes. I'm completely disappointed.
1,Not so everlasting.....,"This toy lasted 1 day with our one year old German Shorthair Pointer. She chewed the plastic apart to get to the treat, then quickly devoured the treat!"
1,Lasted 1 hr...,I thought this would be a great toy for my dog. He had the ball torn in two in under an hour. The treat may last longer but this was a terrible buy.Get a kong!
2,Kept her interested...until she chewed the entire thing to bits.,"I've got a mini-Aussie/Blue Heeler mix, so she's a small/medium-sized dog at 25 lbs. She managed to chew the toy up in 20 minutes. So if you're dog's a strong chewer, don't waste your money! Great for dainty chewers, though, like my Corgi."
2,Treats come Out!,My puppy can rip the treat out of these very quickly and then starts eats/swallowing the material itself. I am not impressed.
2,Everlasting Treat Does Not Last!,"So we got this toy for our dog who gets bored easily, but loves treats. Unfortunately we left this ""everlasting"" treat ball with him for 15 minutes unsupervised and he managed to crack the large treat disc and gobbled it all up. We use the rubber toy now to fill it with kibble, a milkbone or jerky when we leave him in the apt by himself. It keeps him occupied for maybe 5-10 minutes because he knows he has to bite down in the center to crunch up the treats. It makes a huge mess so be warned. However, the pro to this toy is that it withstands his powerful chewing."
1,Lasted 2 hours,"I have a 10 month old Vizsla and she is a chewer. I got this thinking I'd finally found something that could stand up to her chewing. It was looking good the first hour, but when I looked over to her chewing closer to hour 2 I saw that she had taken off chunks of the blue ball itself. Apparently she found the 'lip' of the ball and proceeded to rip chunks off the ball in an attempt to get the treat. This is not very durable. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Its no longer lasting than anything else,"We have a medium size dog who loves to chew. We were looking for a long lasting treat that could keep him occupied for hours and tried the everlasting dog treat ball. I inserted the treat into the toy and gave it to him as soon as it arrived to see how long it would really last. At first it seemed like it was going to work great, but within 15 minutes he had mastered the art of removing treats from the toy and had chomped through half the treat. Once he figured it out the first time, he could remove additional new treats in a minute or two. We went to whole foods and bought 6 bones for the same price as one of these treats; its been an hour and he is still working on the first one."
2,Not so everlasting,"I have a 7 month old springer spaniel puppy, and I've been going through toys at a rapid clip. I bought this because I thought it might keep him occupied awhile and that the toy part would last. He wasn't terribly interested in it at first, but later on he made a project of it. I was encouraged when he stayed working on it for about 30 minutes. He popped the treat out soon after that. I didn't mind so much because I thought he'd just keep chewing on the plastic part - and he did. Unfortunately, it only took another 1/2 hour or so before he had chewed little bits off. I give it poor ratings because a toy named ""everlasting"" should hold up better than that, esp. one so expensive."
1,Smells like plastic infused with a chemical,"Opened it and it reeks of a horrible odor. Smells like chemicals and plastic. Even the included chicken treat smells.My dog rejected it immediately.I thought about running it through my dishwasher, but then read the packaging more closely. Made in China. The treat included with the treat is a different composition and has more fillers (wheat, etc.) than the extra package of 2 treats I bought. I decided that I'm returning it with a complaint."
2,Beware if you have a highly intelligent dog,"My 6 year old doberman dissembled both treats from this large ball in less than 2 minutes, and had consumed them in even less time."
2,"Good idea, but...","When I saw this toy/treat I thought it would be the perfect distraction for our very active 1-year old Pug. We also have 3 geriatric (12-13) Pugs in the house. Owing to their push-face structure, Pugs have impossibly crooked little nubs of teeth crowded into their small mouths. I tossed this Ball into the floor, and within 5 minutes, Mildred, who's 12, had the treat out of the ball. The treat alone seems like a choking hazard to me, and we are not able to use this item for any purpose. I loved the design, but won't be buying it again b/c the design does not serve the purpose."
2,I'm pretty sure my dog swallowed part of it.,"I bought the medium sized ball for my pug. He managed to pry the brown ""lid"" off and ate and swallowed the damn thing. I'm glad it didn't kill him, so I guess it was designed just in case a dog consumed it whole. I think the ""lid"" could pose a choke hazard to some dogs less voracious than pugs."
2,treat out in <1 min. devoured in about 5 minutes,"My dog loves theStarMark Day-Glo Everlasting Fun Ball, Medium, Greenthat you can stick treats into or just roll around and play fetch. I bought this one because I wanted him to chew on treats longer. He'll take his time with a small bully stick, but those get expensive. These would be more expensive because he had the treat out in a few seconds and chewed it up in a few minutes. Bummer!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"My dog had this ball in tiny plastic pieces in 3 hours. He popped the Everlasting treat out in just under 10 minutes. Granted, he was not having luck getting the cookie that was inside, but would have gotten there by shredding the entire toy if I hadn't had to take it away from him."
1,Do not leave unattended,"This toy billed to keep dogs entertained for hours lasted my dog 20 min.Be very careful with this toy. My boy ended up swallowing a big piece which made him sick and resulted in a very expensive trip to the vet. Fortunately it did not cause a blockage, but I'm not taking the risk."
4,"Tough ball, but remove the treat.","There wasn't anything ""everlasting"" about this treat ball. My dog had the treat polished off in less than 30 minutes. The ball itself is pretty tough, so I now put treats inside the slots were the everlasting treat was. It works out much better and is far cheaper than replacing the treat itself."
3,Not good for Giant breeds!,"I have an Alaskan Malamute (120lbs) who I do not consider an aggressive chewer, but he is powerful. Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days. Well worth it in her case.I think the key is getting a size appropriate for your dog. If your dog can fit the entire thing in its mouth, it's too small. When in doubt get the next size up, and if you have an XL mouthed breed don't bother."
4,"1 ball, 2 treats = 3 hours for my pit","My pit mix is a pretty devoted chewer. I put one everlasting treat into each side of my large everlasting treat ball (and I should mention that this itself took about ten minutes - those things are NOT easy to get in). My superchewer managed to finish both treats in a marathon 3 hour chew fest. She hurt her leg this week and is supposed to be resting, so it was nice to be able to keep her happily occupied for a while.The ball itself is something we inherited from a friend's dog and we've had it for a while. I don't think it's indestructible but it's one of those toys that she prefers to carry around and play with than to chew. We sometimes put her kibbles inside the toy and she likes that too - I would say that it ranks fourth in her heart after scented jolly balls, waggle toys and new tennis balls."
3,Didn't Last,"Got this for my 9-yr-old Australian shepherd. I also bought the orange one for the younger dog. Both dogs were able to remove the treats from the balls in under 10 minutes. (It took me at least 5 minutes to put the treat in.) I'm glad I tried it, but won't get any more. Neither of my dogs is a very aggressive chewer...just very clever."
3,Not Quite Everlasting...,"My two Siberian Huskies were able to remove the Everlasting Treat Refill from the ball within about 15 minutes and devour the treat in short order. I won't bother buying additional ""Not-So-Everlasting"" refills, but I was able to place different types of treats in the ball - including Iams dog biscuits, Trader Joe's beef rolls (broken into smaller pieces), and freeze dried liver training treats. The treat balls are a softer texture than a Kong toy, but still quite durable."
4,Great challenge...,I think the design is great for this treat delivery toy. The large puck shaped things are too easy for my dog to remove so I load one of those and some dog biscuits into the ball once he gets the puck out I take that away. Too much treat at one time for him. He doesn't mind cause I think he likes his biscuits better anyway. After tonight's 4 mile hike he is still into his everlasting... stuffing it with his normal biscuits keeps him entertained and preoccupied. He has brought it to me tonight about three times. Each time I say Yep there is more... and toss it back to him...
1,Not so everlasting...,"I bought this dog toy in the smaller size, with great anticipation of finally having something that my 1/2 Yorkie-1/2 Shih Tzu wouldn't chew up and destroy in one afternoon. From that standpoint, I would say the toy was a success, because it actually took him about 24 hours to eat the ends out of the toy, nab the treat disk and be done with it. <sigh> I'm still on the hunt for SOMETHING that Buddy can't destroy. This, unfortunately, was not it."
1,not very interactive,My 4 yr old Westie figured out how to get the treat out in 10 seconds and didn't even look at the plastic part after.
2,wish I'd saved my money,I second the reviews that say not worth it. My dog popped the treat out within minutes and has already eaten half of it. I don't think this will keep her from eating my shoes after all.
3,Great idea but product need improvement,I have a 65lbs boxer and a 107lbs. olde english bulldogge so I bought the large size. My chewer the bulldog who I bought the product for popped the treat out in under 2 minutes. The boxer played with for over an hour. I HATE that an item over $20 is made in China and with no regulation. I would not leave my dog alone with this product. I think it's a great idea but the product could be improved upon.
1,Didn't last for my dog,"I just received the large ""everlasting treat"", opened it up, and presented it proudly to my 2 year old yellow Lab. He took it and layed on his favorite spot on the carpet to start chewing it. Within 10 minutes he had popped out the treat. I put it back in but again within minutes he popped it back out. Needless to say, this toy is a big disappointment."
3,My dog is just way too smart...,"So I got this for my Belgian Malinois who is ball-crazy and always destroys both plushy toys and kongs alike. A friend of mine who has a large shepherd said her dog loved to toss it around the house, chew on the treat on the inside, repeat. He absolutely loved it. In hopes mine would love it the same, I got it. BOTH treats were out of the ball in about five minutes(not exaggerating!) but lucky me my dog loved the bounce the ball had and continued to play with it. I put some rolled cooked bacon mixed with raw beef in the very center of it, and he is hard at work right now trying to pry it out of the center. Overall it was a good buy, but not because of the ""challenge"". Only because my dog loves the ball itself. I wouldn't purchase the treat inserts again, thats for sure!"
2,not so good!,"I have a 6yr old beagle who doesn't have much teeth and like to gum things to death. I bought this product thinking the name ""Everlasting"" Treat Ball would be great for my almost toothless sweet heart...well she loved it! great! I would give it to her for 15-20 min increments. One day I thought I would give it to her while I ran some errands...I was about 1/2 an hour, came home to a destroyed ball. It was all in pieces. Thank God she didn't eat and choke on the rubber pieces. Everlasting it sure isn't!"
1,Not So Everlasting,"I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs. One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys. I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided. On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them. In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls. By three hours there were no treats left in either of them. Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too. The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room. I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name."
1,The treats made my dog vomit.,"My dog loved the ball and the everlasting treat but about 12 hours after going crazy licking it, she'd throw it all up. I tried again two weeks later, convinced that maybe it was something else that had made her sick, and like clockwork, 12 hours went by and she vomited again. She loves the ball so I will probably put her biscuits in the very inside and let her play with it that way. I regret spending so much on this toy."
4,He loves it,"Well- my mastiff is able to get the whole thing in his mouth and bite down- which pops the treat out immediately. So I thought- ""great- another waste of money"". So I did not bother to replace the treats anymore...but it turns out that he just likes to chew on it. And he does- alot!. This is a different kind of really tough and flexible material and it is still intact after several months. So- turns out it was a hit after all!!"
4,Really Tough Toy,"I gave this toy to my 50 lb lab mix, Maddi, a few days ago, with an everlasting treat in each end. She's been gnawing and playing with it ever since, and she still hasn't gotten in to the treats yet. I bought the large, and it's a little too big for her, but she doesn't seem to mind. She can't pick it up until the everlasting treats are chewed almost all the way through. It's given her plenty to chew on though. She hasn't looked at anything else since she got it."
2,Better for those that aren't chewers,"My dog quickly figured out that just biting this ball sideways caused the treat to pop out for easier munching. He made quick work of the ""everlasting"" treat hunk once it was released from the ball and would repeatedly pop it back out if I reloaded it. I now use this to just stuff regular treats inside of and it is mediocre. Definitely not the best or longest lasting treat toy I've found. For the price, it's just not worth it AT ALL.Perhaps smaller dogs or dogs that are less prone to chewing would get more long lasting enjoyment out of this. It is more like the ""10 minute treat crunching bonanza"" for my boy than everlasting.The Premier Busy Buddy treat dispensing toys (particularly this:Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large) are more durable, offer more options for filling, and are more difficult/entertaining for the dog...and also much cheaper! I would highly recommend buying this instead."
3,Kept him busy...for awhile,If you have a dog that loves food or is strong willed then skip this toy my yellow lab had gotten that done with in 30 min
4,"Sturdy toy, but pricey","My dogs have chewed up every toy I have ever bought in less than 30 minutes. I have two Jack Russells, and they are set on destroying everything that is theirs. I bought two of these balls last Christmas and both are still 100% intact. I hardly ever put treats in them and the male dog loves to play fetch with it or even just chew on it in front of the tv. I give it 4 stars though because it costs a lot and the treats come out too easily. Although, I would have spent well over $100 on other balls that they would have destroyed in the last year, so I guess when you look at it that way, it's more than worth its cost."
2,Dog loves them but..,"My dog loves the treats, but they don't stay in the ball long enough and once out they disappear quickly. The treats are pretty expensive for the short time they last (10-15 minutes). I was looking for something to keep the dog busy and entertained for awhile. If you're paying attention you can put the treat back in place and extend the time a little. The ball itself is quality material and hasn't gotten chewed up. Unless the treats drop in price significantly I probably won't buy anymore."
3,"Dog loved this toy, but my pocket book didn't.","The toy is a great concept. My dog loved to roll it around and knaw on it. Totally kept him occupied. The unfortnate thing is this ""everlasting"" treat ball is far from everlasting. My dog had both sides chewed down within one day. After it was chewed down flat he wanted to have nothing to do with it. The ball it's self is around 17 dollars and only came with one treat. The ball fits 2 treats so you instantly have to buy the refill pack which costs about 8 dollars. Cant afford 8 dollars a day in treats."
2,Gone in 5 minutes,My dogs can remove the insert and scarf it down in 15 minutes. Too expensive for 15 minutes of entertainment. I made some toys out of old tennis balls that keep them entertained longer.
1,Gone in 1800 Seconds,"Don't buy this! The main ingredient of the treats is wheat gluten, for one. Also my dog ate the entire thing, rubber and all, in less than 30 minutes. It's a miracle he didn't have more problems than just diarrhea."
1,Not Great,The treat popped in less than 10 minutes.It took 1.5 hours before I was pulling bits of plastic out of my dogs mouth. Really REALLY expensive for such a short play time. I just went back to using his Kong.
3,Good dog toy,"This is a great product. Our golden retriever loves it, and the treats last him for days. But...the product description on Amazon is incorrect, in that it only includes one (not two) everlasting treats. It can fit two, but only comes with one."
2,Not so great or everlasting as they may seem,"I bought one of these (the small size) from a pet store for my 15 lb Jack Russel mix. I was hoping for a toy that would hold together like a kong but was harder to get the treat out of. The first day we had it, it took a while for him to get the treat out but once he got it there was no problem and the plastic started to weaken. This wasn't a big deal because you can stuff the inside with more treats but after a while the plastic started to come apart in little chucks and the toy went from a possible kennel toy to have to be supervised..."
2,Not undestructable,It took like 10 minutes for my dog to get the treat out the first time. We put the treat in backwards thinking it would take him longer and he'd actually have to work a little to get it out. It did take 45 minutes but in the process - he tore apart the treatball and I had little pieces of blue rubber all over the place. i was looking for something that would keep him occupied a while but this isn't the answer. He is a strong dog - Boxer/Anatolian mix so his jaws are strong.On the positive side - he does like playing catch with it and the way it bounces so he does play with it without a treat in it.
1,not a good idea and not everlasting,This bal container is good for putting other treats inside it but the ball refills are expensive and they make my dog sick. They also do not last for very long. Putting the treat inside it is REALLY DIFFICULT...VERY HARD...TAKES A LONG TIME WITH LOTS OF STREENGTH...and then once the dog has chewed enough to get it out she can eat the whole thing right away and then the next day has diarrhea all day.
2,Not As Described,"The product I received today was different packaging than what is pictured here, and only contained one treat not two as shown. So if you are buying this, you may want to purchase a refill pack of treats right away so that you can have both sides full before giving it to your dog.So far, my dog will not try it. It has a funky, plastic smell to it. Hopefully that will fade, and she will be more interested in it."
4,Worthwhile purchase,My dog likes the treats & it keeps him occupied for a while. Only dislike is trying to get the leftover portion of the treat out of the ball.
1,Can be dangerous,My dogs love these treat balls but last week my pug got the treat out and swallowed a large piece of it. It was lodged somewhere that made her uncomfortable enough to not want to lay down for 24 hours. She sat and swallowed a lot. I gave her warm chicken broth thinking that would help melt it... and it did but took 24 hours.I will not buy these treats again and I threw away the ball!
1,The dog doesn't like it!,"I got this for my 22 lb shih tzu who is pretty good at figuring things out. He is totally disinterested in this toy (which I bought at retail for $20). He doesn't find the treat at all appealing and because the flaps seem rather stiff, his kibble doesn't come out. He has a cube that I fill with kibble that he rolls all over the house and he just loves that--but this doesn't do it for him.$20 would have paid for a lot of treats!!"
1,What a waste of money!!,"The idea of the treat insert is great, but the durability of these balls is horrific! My two poodle-mixes shred those balls within 5 minutes, what a waste of money!!!"
1,5 minute treat,The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix. Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear. If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.
1,Not a great product for its cost,"The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great concept but poorly executed. The Everlasting Treat end caps come off very easily with a minimum amount of slobber. My puppy would lick them (because I'm sure they taste great) and within 5 minutes, the caps were off of the ball. The soft rubber makes it very easy to get them out this way. And they're a little too expensive to be made so poorly.My puppy loves to chew the ball to get any inner treats and food out, but there are better products on the market for that. Very disappointing product."
2,"Looked neat, but disappointing","I thought this looked like a pretty neat toy, so I bought one. Like the above reviewer, my dogs couldn't deal with the treat that covers one end of the ball. They licked it a few times, pushed the ball around a few times, and that was it. They could not figure out how to get out the little treats inside, because there are flaps covering the opening, which you bend to pop in the little treats. These flaps keep the little treats from falling out when the ball moves, but they were just thick enough so that my dogs couldn't figure out how to push them aside to get at the treats.In all fairness, my dogs are chihuahuas--the biggest is about 7 pounds -- and a larger dog may very well have more fun with this. Sadly, my dogs just seem to be too small for the small size."
2,Everlasting Treat Ball - My Dog Destroyed It On The Ride Home,"I bought an everlasting treat ball because everyone told me how wonderful they are, and I have a Jack Russell Terrier who is fairly calm for the breed, but does tend to have a bit of a seperation anxiety problem as soon as I leave. I got it yesterday, popped the caps on either end of the ball, and gave it to him on the five mile ride back to my apartment. By the time I had gotten home, he had already popped one of the caps off and chewed it up, so I took that one away and popped the third cap on, and gave it back to him, and both caps were off and eaten within probably fifteen minutes of being at home. I am completely unimpressed, I spent over $16 on these treats and the ball, and the Everlasting Treat ball was useless in a matter of minutes. I still really like the idea of this product, but the ball itself needs to be manufactured in a way that would really grip the treats a lot better."
2,Disappointing,This didn't last more than a couple of days. My 30 lb. Brittany destroyed it. I got a Kong to replace it and it's MUCH sturdier!
3,Not too impressed,"I got the medium size for both my 20 pound corgis. I put each in a crate with one of these, brand new. In three hours when I came home there were no more treats. Not really everlasting, but now I just put yogurt and peanut butter in and freeze them for a treat to keep them busy. The refills are just too expensive when they go so fast. They didn't chew the holder up yet, so that's a plus. I got them for a bargain price so that is the only reason I bought. Pet stores are charging way too much for these."
2,Quick destruction,Not very everlasting for my Beagle who got the big treat out in 5 minutes and chewed it up to get the little treats out...
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent for my small-breed dog. Your dog may prefer specific flavors so try them all as they come in two chews to a pack, small size treat for small size ball/holder. My pup likes the chicken it came with, but does not care for the liver; I put a different flavor on each side. My dog loves to lick and chew this and it seems to not be affected. I think this is my dogs favorite chew toy and I highly recommend your dog try one of these. The chews seem to last a long time and not break apart, so far. I recommend all chewing devices be supervised during use."
1,not everlasting at all,My 10 month old Australian shepherd had this time torn up in about 5 minutes. The treat was out in 2 minutes and it took another additional 3 minutes for her to chew up and start eating the blue plastic ball so that another treat would not even stay in it. I trashed the whole thing first 15 minutes I had it! This might work for a really dumb dog but not one that has any brains what so ever! What a disappointment.
3,Really depends on the dog,"I bought this after seeing my greyhound going crazy for it at the vet's office. But now that he has one, he couldn't care less about trying to eat the treat disk that came with the product. However, he does like the dry kibble that I stuff in the bottom. But for that purpose alone, I suggest getting a large gatorade bottle and using a knife to make a small hole on the side."
2,Medium is too small for my 37 pound dog!,"I was very disappointed when my dog had the everlasting treat out within 5 minutes. And when I put it back in and let it dry, he had already figured it out and popped it out in seconds.I think this is because it was too small for him. It says for dogs ""under 40 lbs"", and my dog is a little shy of that mark. The large looked really big and the product says that medium is good for under 40lbs... Apparently not though. Since he could get his mouth around the edge of the toy, he could pop out the everlasting treat.Not sure it's a bad product, just maybe the wrong size. But now I'm too scared of wasting $20 on the large in case that's a dud too."
1,Not good for large dogs,"I got this in a large size, however my bulldogge had the treats out in five minutes and ate the blue ball they were in. I guess it would work well for something with a little less bite power, but my bullys and mastiffs made easy work of it."
3,"Love the ball, treats not so much","I bought this for my Boston Terrier, Cookie, who can destroy most toys in less than an hour. I thought the idea of a treat inside would slow her down a little. Unfortunately, the treat did not suit her finicky palate, and she simply worked it out of the ball and left it on the floor. The ball itself, however, has turned out to be Cookie-proof. Months after the purchase, she still plays with it. It bounces nicely, and doesn't roll under the furniture as much as other balls. I've also found that if I stuff it with her regular treats (small bits of chicken jerky) or her kibble, it does keep her occupied for a while. Although she chews on it, I can find very little evidence of toothmarks, so whatever this is made of is pretty strong. I would give this more stars if it was easier to load, but then it would probably be easier for her to un-load. Overall, a tough little toy, and one of Cookie's favorites. A little pricey, but hey, she's worth it!"
3,Good toy,"This treat toy would get 5 stars if it weren't for 2 very important things: 1) the small treat ball is almost impossible to get treats into, as the opening is so tiny; 2) my dog had the disc treat out and wolfed down in less than a minute. Now I also have this treat ball in the large size for my German Shepherd and have not had the same problem with the disc treat coming out so maybe it's a function of the size, I don't know."
3,The dog loved it....a little too much,"My Jack Russell terrier mix loved this treat. More than life itself. He had it out of the ball in no time flat, so that wasn't much of a puzzle. But the treat is like crack for dogs. It's the only thing he's guarded. He's never growled when his dinner or a juicy beef bone is approached. He'd leave either for a chance for some lap time. But not with this treat.So...I would be wary. I'm just hoping it won't make him guard other things now.Oh, and for the price? It seems like they could include two treats, which the ball will accommodate.ETA: the ball does seem to be durable, which is good."
3,"Not too ""everlasting""","So my pup is smarter than the average... Pup. And she figured out this thing in less than an hour. I literally had just put it together and gave it to her new and when I got back home an hour later she already had one side out, and was working on the second already. To her credit she didn't need to shred the silicone mold to get the end treat out, but none the less, this shouldn't be bought as a stimulation toy."
1,My pom isnt interested,my dog has no interest in this toy at all. i have the treats in it and all and she doesnt even roll it around. waste of money.
4,Boxer loves it but doesnt last long,My boxer absolutely loves this thing but it doesnt last long because he is constantly chewing on it just wearing down the actual treat. With that being said he usually keeps chewing on the ball because it has some extra treat stuck in the edges.
4,The most beautiful set for a little girl!,"This is by far the most beautiful crib set I've ever seen. The only problem is that most of the pieces are not available online, which is where most of my friends shop to see my registry."
4,Fine cast brings film for entire family,"Charming and beautifully filmed. Gorgeous photography. Script could have been more layered. Not enough conflict in husband/wife relationship at the beginning to give audience investment in it's restoration. Wonderful cast with some fine acting by everyone. Just not enough conflict (lost dog, too many scenes searching for dog and a questionable scene of spotting the lost dog from an airplane.) Interpersonal relations from all the characters could have been more fully developed.A nice film that the entire family can watch together."
3,Cute,"Brace yourself: this movie proves that a script can prevent good acting. I don't know of any two actors I enjoy more than Keaton and Kline, but watching this movie was like watching them do a read through. I didn't believe any of it. The story was cute and wholesome, though, and I didn't really mind it. Only okay."
3,Not really about the dog,"This movie was good, not great. More about human relationships than the lost dog. I happen to love Kevin Kline and Diane Keaton, so did enjoy the film, though it was probably somewhat longer than it needed to be. Glad I waited to rent it, rather than seeing it at the movie theater."
3,Nice movie..,Diane Keaton is always fun to watch. I would not call this a 'must see movie' but it was entertaining enough to be worth my time to watch it and review it.
5,great movie,this movie is so true to life. everyone goes through problems in there life and is true to life. and one dog brings every one together again.
5,Baby Boomers in Crisis,"My husband I just watched this movie and loved it! We are the same age as the characters in the movie and we kept saying to one another, ""We would say that"" or ""We would do that""! We both loved the low key story and the characters played out around a lost dog. It was life on the screen. For those that criticize this film, they must be much younger than we are! This is a great date night movie for adults!"
3,Darling Companion,"I really did like this movie but was expecting a little more after watching the commercials for it. It is a good romantic comedy but it could have been better. The actors were good, the story line is pretty good, and I love romantic comedies...this just wasn't as good as it could have been. I hate that once you have seen the commercials---you've basically seen all the good scenes in a movie."
2,OK but not great,"This was not my favorite movie, and I generally love movies with dogs in them. I like seeing movies where humans care so deeply for animals, and are committed to that connection. It's difficult to articulate, but I just didn't like it that much. I liked the actors and I liked the dog. So...maybe it was the screenplay or the direction that just wasn't quite right."
4,LorraineinSt.Augustine,"This is a wonderful, feel-good movie. Not main-stream cotton candy fluff. There is a little more depth to the characters even though the plot is not deep. Keeps your interest and of course, Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline pull it off! Seller was prompt."
4,Not as animal-centered as I expected,"This was a good movie (although it was really slow at first. It took about 40 minutes to get into it.) But it wasn't quite as animal oriented as I'd hoped. My family loves movies about pets. (Hatchi had us crying for weeks!) and I was looking for something like that. But this is much more focused on Joesph and Beth's relationship. Which was still good. Just now what I expected, is all. I'd hoped for more of a story about the dog."
1,So. Lame.,"In a phrase: Boring White People Problems. There are compelling movies that show the complexities of long term relationships and the connections we have with animals, this is not one of them. Not worth your time or money."
3,Darling Companion,"Darling Companion is a movie to watch when you want to relax and get away from a challenging work schedule. It is entertaining, but light and useful for just such an occasion."
1,Disappointing,"Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline by the director of Big Chill - how could it be bad? It was terrible. The pace was slow, the story predictable and nothing surprising at all. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't waste your time watching it. So many better movies with these great actors."
2,Darling Companion,Was not to wow'd over this movie..took for EVER to get to the PLOT.. notto mention the story was very long and drawn out...
2,oh hum...,"Movie is a version of tried and true ""family problems are flaring when the dog to take a hike thereby causing the humans to go bananas, forgetting their problems in their communal anguish over the dog. When they have suffered enough, the dog lets itself be found."
2,"Sorry, just not a good movie...","This is typical Diane Keaton....just a fluff movie. I love animals, but not this one. Must be the reason I never it saw it released at the movies. Too bad, I do love Kevin Kline."
4,THE GENIALITY BEHIND THE SIMPLICITY,"A simple story carried along with a marvelously talented cast, charming script and a breath-taking setting. The chemistry between Keaton and Kline surprisingly works and their portrayal of a ""couple in a crisis"" is touching and pleasing. Her, as the courageous, first-time (but no less devoted and loving) dog owner and him, as a oblivious and one-track minded surgeon.The film is not, by any means, a masterpiece, but that's not always necessary. All you need is a comforting message."
3,Great concept but too drawn out,"I should start by saying that I love to watch Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline as actors, and that plus the fact that this was supposed to be a movie about a dog drew me to watch it. I liked the way losing the dog brought the family together, and the scenes with the dog were adorable, but at least 9/10 of the movie had to do with looking for the missing dog and working out prickly personal issues. It got old pretty fast. Had they made this more of a heartwarming comedy and less of a journey to self discovery, I would have loved it. As it was, we saw very little of the dog, and every scene was basically a rehash of previous ones. I only gave it a 3 because I loved the dog and the actors."
1,Disappointed,Love Ms Keaton so really excited to see this movie. Was not a good show. Really let down by it.
2,Darling Companion,Cute idea but dragged. Watched because of the actors but this movie did not provide the the level of performance that the actors usually provide.
2,Boring story!,Same old Diane Keaton's acting. Boring story. If you are dog lovers you may like this one otherwise skip it and don't waist your time.
5,Help,"Too bad the only ones available are over $150. I think I would pay $40, which is a lot for a 32 page paperback. We read it over and over to our kids, and we want to read it to our grandkids. Now this is not only a great children's book, but after reading, you can MAKE apple pigs!"
4,"Apples, Apples, Apples",My three kids and I all enjoyed this book years ago (in the 70's) reading about the wonderful apple tree that produced so many apples the family did not know what to do with them all!! Just like my kids' granny who also had a fruit orchard and had about a zillion ways to use the various fruits. ...
1,Streaky Ink,sure it was on time but it seemed like the printer used was running out of ink so there were streaks of green where black was supposed to be used.
5,Conversation piece while you do dishes,"Guests always comment on the gloves when I don them for dish duty. They do run ever so slightly small, so if you have a big hand they may not fit. I buy them in many colors as I find them very useful and fun to wear."
2,Could have been a lot better,"This book could have been really good. Swift Thunder and Moon Song were likable, although Moon Song did not have a strong enough personality. She was always ""murmuring"" (the author way overused that word!) and clinging to Swift Thunder like she couldn't do anything for herself. The plot was very boring, and predictable at times. And it was written SO simply that it was almost like reading a child's book. I couldn't believe it made it to publication. The premise of two people from enemy tribes falling in love could have been so much more exciting than this book. Look somewhere else for a better Indian romance."
1,ridiculous,"This book was so silly ,I think a 8 year old kid would have laughed at it.Especially the part where Moon Song has a dream that Swift Thunder is an English knight riding through the sky on a steed racing to recue her.Also it is sickening how these 2 lovesick characters fawn over ""THE BLACK ROBE ""priests .....from England?Excuse me The Black Robes were French.These so-called ...European benefactors were the ones who brought about the first destruction of the Eastern Tribes with their small-pox and superior attitudes and policies.I can,t beleive a book so silly and badly written would ever get published.I wish there were more American Indian authors out there instead of the glut of white female romance authors who fail to capture the real essence of Aboriginal history and way of life."
1,Cheaply Made,"Without reviewing the light system, because that is not what we are talking about here and can all agree that hi-end lighting is the best.As far as the leg supports: For four pieces of molded plastic, and four metal inserts to hold lighting for some systems that may cost in excess of $300 - these are crappola!We understand that when you clean your tank and remove the lighting system you must be careful - however, if you are not being perfectly careful these things will crack. The metal inserts are far from perfect, and the screws that hold the metal in place with the legs are ever so small.The light system needs to be supported on these units - there either has to be a better way to support the unit, or the support system needs to be revamped.I suggest that if you found a better way to support the unit - put it online. We would all appreciate the advice."
1,Failure in advertising.,"The packaging and Amazon's description say these legs are compatible with any Aqualight. However, they don't work for the 5620 model(Coralife's cheap model lights). In addition, the package lists brass screws but these screws don't look much like brass to me. Hopefully this review will keep you from mistakenly ordering like I did."
3,"Nice try,but somewhat weak","I have gone through 2 sets of these legs. I am now waiting for my third to arrive. I have the 48"" deluxe 4 tube aqualight on my tank. It's quite heavy and these legs just dont last, but they are neccessary for me. I think they need to use a stronger plastic in creating these, as well as bigger screws. They also have an adjustable mounting set that unfortunately doesnt work with glass canopies...I have a big fish that likes to jump, so those do me no good."
3,An excellent general excercise book.,"Gary Player is known to be a excercise maniac. In this book he describes his program and illustrates 100 or so individual excercises. I found it almost too general and not specific to excercises designed to improve ""golf"" skills. Do you really need Gary Player to demonstrate the ""push up""?If one followed Mr. Player's program you would be fit for golf, life or just about anything else."
4,Anyone Fitter than this great International Champ over Time?,"Not even Tiger has demonstrated the durability and winnability that Player has over his long career.What distinguishes this fine book is the section which diagnoses one's current physical capabilities for golf, then attunes what to do based on results.Includes normal exercises, plus stretches, working with heavy clubs, weights, exercise balls, etc.Also, great warmup advice."
3,"Missing ""Special Features"" and Preposterous Premise","A group of anthropologists in 2210 trying to figure out why the population and civilization collapsed? I think they would already know!! They would have all they could do to survive with the methane self releasing to dramatically worsening climate with a very high extinction rate. Jared Diamond blows it when he says the population is 6 1/2 billion, when it was closer to 6.8 billion when this was filmed in 2009. The interviewed scientists and professors indicated the collapse would happen in a matter of several months to several years time in a decade or two from now. I think it will happen a decade or two later than that and take a decade, and I've be studying it since 1967.The parts on the demise of Phoenix and Las Vegas are very good. It bummed me out that the ""Special Feature"" section would not work. Supposed to be Treasure Seekers of the Incas. Also, after one play, the DVD did not want to replay. However, the next day it seemed to run OK."
4,A softer approach...,"This was a very well done documentary about things to come. Unlike Collapse by Michael C. Ruppert, National Geo spins it a bit more optimistic, as always. They suggest that there is room for change and if we do so our society will sustain. However, it appears that the scientists and authors featured in this film may not agree. I would love to get them off camera and get their true take on the current situation(s) and predicted chronological outcomes as our world continues to erode. For those who don't lend true credibility to Ruppert, or for those who have friends or family that need an introduction to the true ""reality show"" on how we have mis-handled our planet and her resources, than this is a great film. Great to have regardless."
2,Used library copy,I did not realize that this DVD was a used library copy. More used than most private party used DVDs. I was expecting better.
4,Regional codes as an obstacle,"Unfortunately, I was not able to play the dvd at my home TV-widescreen set due to the obstacle withregional codes. So, I watched it at my computer at work. I liked it."
3,Lame representation of the book.,"Bought this because I read the book and my husband does not read much. Wanted him to be able to see what I read. Should have paid attention to the negative reviews. They would have been better off to have left the archaeologist from the future out and worked more on the wonderful research and prose Diamond put in the book. We piece together prehistory from what archaeologists find today. But even the dark ages preserved some written knowledge. We had some idea of what civilization was like before the dark ages. I am sure if we go through a collapse some of our knowledge would also survive in some form. So the who don't have a clue archaeologist thing just took away from some really good writing. If you are not a person that reads, it is better than nothing, barely."
2,Weird Recording,"When I listened to the music samples for this CD on this web site prior to purchasing, I was taken by the sound of the music. However, aftering ordering this CD and listening to it on my stereo at home, I have a different opinion. There is absolutely no soundstage or depth at all on this CD. The sound of the music is thin. Usually when you have solo instruments like trumpets, the solo instruments stand out. This recording does not provide that. Everything is bunched together right between the speakers and to me, at least, is quite annoying, and disappointing. The CD label and production are Italian, and I had never heard of it before. That doesn't really mean anything, but I would look elsewhere it you want Torelli trumpet music."
3,KRUPS Toaster,"This is the first time I've been motivated to comment on a product in order to save others an expensive mistake. The 4 slot, 1500Watt toaster has more negative attributes than positive.On the positive side: the mechanism to raise the toast higher than normal when retrieving it is useful; the slot width accommodates fat bagels well; independent controls for pairs of slots doesn't waste energy heating 4 slots when only 2 are used.On the negative side: this toaster is VERY slow to toast bread; it has a very large footprint on the counter with a good portion of that footprint from the airspace between the plastic case and the toasting unit; the slots are not long enough for a standard slice of SaraLee sliced white bread.In my family's opinion, the slow toasting is enough reason to avoid this device."
4,Toaster Oven Convert,"I have always had toaster ovens. After the third oven burned out in a short time I decided to try a pop-up toaster. I am very happy with it. It fits big slices of bakery bread without problem. The bagel feature is great! The ""toast lifter"" feature is wonderful for my kids, I don't have to worry about them sticking their fingers or a knife in it to get the toast. Overall, I am pleased."
4,Fast but not even,"Even though this toaster does not toast evenly - I like how fast it does get the job done, the quality of toaster, and the features for the price. I do wish I had noticed before ordering that this model does not have the keep warm feature. I toast gluten free frozen bread & waffles, tricky items to toast - the defrost/toast feature is fast and results in good consistency gluten-free toast & waffles. I toast the same gluten-free products in my daughter's bargain brand toaster - this toaster produces a much more enjoyable gluten-free eating experience. Well worth some unevenness. I also wish it had a nice audible alert when the toast is done, I'm not accustomed to my toast being ready so quickly."
2,worked well until the lever broke on the right within 6 months!,"what a shame! it worked well until the lever mechanism broke with very ordinary use. so much for the warranty, we have to send it for repair, at our expense and it will take 4 to 6 weeks.we bought the electric teakettle and the lid closing mechanism has broke in 2 months. they will just replace it, no send back.krups needs to work on their reliability. thank goodness amazon has such good prices, otherwise, i would be furious. we will try the same toaster again and hope for the best."
4,Toaster,"I love my new Krups four slice toaster. The settings are easy to use, the toaster is easy to clean, and it is handy to be able to use it as a warmer for toast and rolls. The only adverse thing about this purchase is it's size."
4,fireman proof so far,I am a firefighter and this is for the firehouse. We brake everything and thus far this is holding up. Check with me again in a few
2,Don't waste your $$!,"We have had this toaster for well over a year. It worked well the first few times, then took longer & longer to toast. We now have to have it on the darkest setting and even THEN it takes a good 3-5 minutes to get any color. My husband & I use it maybe once a week; it's not like its getting a huge workout. As a previous reviewer said, the slots aren't long enough. If you're planning on toasting, say, sourdough slices, you'll have to cut them in half.I think you'll find yourself cursing this wretched device as your eggs go cold and your family goes limp with hunger. Better yet, put your bread in, set it to maximum, go take a shower, dry your hair and get dressed -- it should be just about ready when you walk into your kitchen."
3,having purchased it yet,I choosen this chip because I'm familiar with the song list.I would recommend this to a friend who is the same age as me.
4,Worked as advertise,"A few of the songs are too fast so you'll have to slow the tempo (In the Air Tonight for example). Other songs just sounds funky because it's a MIDI version but hey, they can't all be great."
3,Good,Good product comes pity that the dictionary sorted by song and not by author or singer is more difficult to locate the songs
4,leadsinger cartridge,we recieved this product in excellent condition & in a very timely manner. we are very happy.
3,"Product great, deliver too slow",The product itself was great but their delivery is way too slow. It took two weeks for me to receive the product and I needed it sooner than that for a party i was hosting. Not thrilled about it.
5,Hair Styling Creme,"Rusk Wired is still the best styling creme out there. It is not easy to find, but it is worth the hunt! It is particularly good at taming thick, curly hair."
3,Not great and not terrible,"A corpse is found in Dorothy Sayers home and Dorothy becomes the prime suspect. Agatha Christie comes to the rescue, and the two most famous mystery writers of the mid-Twentieth Century set out to solve a mystery. If you are already familiar with events in the lives of Agatha and Dorothy, this book will not reveal anything about their lives that you don't already know. The book is worth reading if you are (as I am) a lover of the works of Agatha and Dorothy. But don't expect the plot or the writing to equal the efforts of the real Agatha Christy and Dorothy Sayers."
1,Not worth the price!,I bought this for my husband for Christmas being that he is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan and after 2 weeks the Cowboys emblem fell off! Now all we have is a coffee mug with a glue spot on it. Should have spent less money and got something that was engraved into the stainless steel! NOt recommended!
5,Awesome game!,I'm pretty sure this came here very fast.This game is very good and definitely more for teens than kids.
1,owww nnoooo,do not have the game yet .I have a playstation 2 and was sent a game for x-box system so i sent it back and have not received a new gamw or refund so i can not give a review yet.
3,Adequate but somewhat off.,"I bought this DVD because it has some of her later work that is not often demonstrated on film. Ms. Collins has reached the time when the voice begins to deteriorate from the excellence of youth, but she still has excellent clarity and very good control. This DVD is not as good as the Wolf Trap show, but it is an acceptable addition to your DVD performance library, especially if you prefer to listen to people who can actually sing, which is getting harder and harder to find these days."
4,"If you like the genre, it is okay","I must confess that I was kind of a disappointed with this one.I was hoping for something more substantial, story wise. It is average for this kind of movie, not bad. I just think that the character development could have been better and not so much FX."
3,Typical ninja movie leaving me wanting more,I wish I could tell you this movie rocked but I can't. It had some neat aspects to it and certain scenes but overall I walked away disappointed. I don't like to give away too many details and spoil it for others but the main story of the movie is a ninja that has left his duties as a ninja and the law is that if someone leaves being a ninja they are hunted down and killed. I would suggest you pass and find a better movie.
1,silouettes or characters,"It does seem to me that if the author is going to use someone else's libretto, there aught to be at least a bit of character development.This is probably the flattest Lackey book I've ever read.A real disappointment."
1,TAKE ME BACK TO VALDEMAR!,The Black Swan was disappointing. The cover art was great but the rest of the book did not reach the high standards which Ms. Lackey has established. It is almost as if she wrote the book while in the 7th grade and finally got around to having it published.
1,not worth your money,"I am a very large fan of Merecedes Lackey, but this book was absolutely horrible. She spends forever on the exposition, forming an intricate plot that isn't actually all that interesting. The actual story of Swan Lake didn't begin until 2/3 into the book, when the prince finally gets around to going hunting and meeting Odette. I found that the uncanny way our heroine's name ""Odile"" was so close to Odette's, as well as the fact that they were look-alikes, was a little to coincidental to believe. The premise of the book, the Baron's (Odile's father) obsession with punishing all women who are unfaithful, untruthful, etc., is rather farfetched, as is his method of giving the evil queen her come-uppance. If you are in the mood for a Mercedes lackey book, I recommend her Heralds of Valedmar series, but avoid this book at all costs."
3,Black Swan,"The Black Swan was a good book, but not Mercedes Lackey's best. It was an excellent version of a classic tale, but did not excel in characterization the way The Lark and the Wren did."
4,Great book!,"This book was a wonderful rendition of ""Swan Lake"". I had read the story and seen the ballet, but had never before been able to simplify with Odile. In this story, she seems a very sympathetic character, simply eager to please and in great need of a friend and someone to love. Odette was calm and full of poise, but showed great emotion and affection for her swans and Prince Siegfried. The reader will feel the despair of the Prince, his love Odette, and Odile at the end of the story."
5,Ballet and Fantasy lovers will enjoy this!,"I am a ballet lover and a fantasy lover, so when I saw this book, I had to read it. I found it very different from the traditional telling of the story, with its numerous endings, both semi-happy and tragic. I enjoyed the way this book is told by Odile, the supposed wicked daughter of Rothbart. The way the plot unfolds makes the most familiar story seem completlely new. I was also pleased with the ending, which was most decidedly happy, where everyone gets what they deserve. It makes the story come full circle, which I can appreciate."
2,A good read,"Well, I must sadly admit that this book did not meet my expectations. I had hoped for a enthralling retelling in the style of The Fire Bird, but this fell short. While still an iteresting tale of magic and betrayal, it lacked the character development to make it truly worthy. Odette's character was hardly developed, and the prince's change of heart too sudden and too complete to be believable. Even Odeil, who was the most defined character in the book was lacking in depth. The Baron and the Queen were mere shadows as far as development goes. This book lacked the attention to detail that I admire in Lackey's work. I hope her other books do not follow this trend."
4,"Well written, enthralling","I am a longtime fan of Lackey's valdemar series, and this book holds much of the same charm. Characters are fleshed out, and there is subtle intrigue throughout which kept me reading late into the night. Incredibly descriptive and with a very satisfying ending. Not her best, but far from her worst."
2,"Disappointing retelling of ""Swan Lake""","Hell hath no fury like a fan disappointed. While I loved FIRE ROSE, THE BLACK SWAN left me cold ( and in hard cover, no less). It wasn't the new happy ending to the tragic tale (I never cared for tragedy anyway), but the lack of logical character development. Siegfried's conversion from rapist to lover is hardly convincing and Odette's character is totally unknown for the first 100 pages of the book. Odile, who manages the happy ending for the other two and a considerable increase in wealth for the principality, is left with the satisfaction of doing good, a home in the aforementioned kingdom (the least they could do) and the possibility of a lover in the Prince's sidekick, ""Benno."" (What kind of name is that for a love interest?!) Not satisfying at all!"
2,Disappointing new book by a usually decent writer,"Revising fairy tales is common fantasy practice, but one wishes that Lackey had written with a bit more wit and punch in this Swan Lake reprise. In her earlier works Lackey wrote some complicated and interesting female characters. THE BLACK SWAN, however, presents us with an evil queen, an enchanted princess, and a young sorceress, none of whom transcend stereotype. The latter two are redeemed by their love for aristocrats, while the former receives her punishment at the hands of (you guessed it!) an evil warlock. The warlock is such a totally nasty guy that it's hard to believe that even his daughter the sorceress could initially believe him to be a decent human being, but that's the premise of the book--she gradually comes to awareness that her father is Not Nice. I waded my way through, but I kept wishing I was reading something else."
2,Great expectations were shot down by a not-so-good book.,"As a loyal Mercedes Lackey fan, I had great expectations for this new release. Though only slightly similar to the animated movie, the Swan Princess, it is well written and completely enjoyable. I would suppose I didn't enjoy it all that much because it wasn't a Valdemar novel-but all her other non-Valdemar books have been great! So, hats off to Mercedes on her new release, and I'm looking forward to reading the River's Gift."
3,Quite Disappointed,"After reading a couple of chapters into the book, it had a strong resemblance to The Swan Princess that I loved so much when I was a child. But as I got deeper into the book I got really disappointed in the plot and the main characters. It seemed like the characters and plot weren't as delveloped as they could be. I might enjoy this book once in a while, but not as one of my favorites.I suggest reading Mercedes Lackey's The Obsidian Trilogy (""The Outstretched Shadow"" and ""To Light A Candle"")."
4,Somewhat uneven,"The Black Swan is an enjoyable retelling of the original ballet. The story, from Odile's perspective, loses some of its original extremities, though little is done to make Von Rothbart a sympathetic villain. Lackey is adept at ornamentation, and there is quite a lot here-- fabulous dresses, balls, etc. Unfortunately, the characters were very unevenly fleshed out. Lackey chose to focus on Odile and Siegfried almost exclusively, and characters like Odette and Benno really needed more individuality. Odile was the only character that seemed complete. Siegfried wasn't terribly likable, and his reform seemed rather implausible. As usual in Lackey's work, there were a few gaps of logic here and there-- not too egregious, but noticeable. The Black Swan seemed altogether lighter weight than previous retellings such as The Fire Rose and The Firebird, both of which I recommend above this one."
3,Not Very Exciting,"This is the first book I have read by Mercedes Lackey. It was a very easy read, but not very action-packed. It was more of a weakly created love story. The characters seemed to have no depth or history. You didn't really get to know them. The magic was very elaborate, but some of it could have been done away with in order to enhance the characters. There is a part when Prince Siegfried meets a gypsy woman by the lake and has his way with her against her will. What did that have to do with anything? I didn't know if I was suppose to not like the Prince or if he was to become a ""changed man"". If I knew more about him, Odile, Odette and the Baron, the story may have been more enjoyable."
4,"Interesting, but lacks depth","I found this book a rather interesting variation of the original Swan Lake, but the writing lacks depth, and it is hard to be properly ""immersed"" in it."
5,Loved it!,"Quick and easy review: Loved this book. I gave it a shot since I loved the Queen's Own (3 books: Arrows of the Queen, Arrow's Flight, and Arrow's Fall). I've read this book many times and each time is a new adventure. Read this book and enjoy!"
2,Not an exciting read,"Compared to some of M. Lackey's earlier works, especially her tales of Valdemar, but this book left me wanting. The characters were flat and the story was contrived and bland. The villian of the story was about the only character who remained consistent. The females of the book were often simpering and melodramatic. The ""heroic"" prince is a confused rapist who falls in love with a the leading fowl of the swan flock.This story would have greatly benefited if the author had made her main character more independent and less of a (excuse the pun) lackey."
3,"Good, but....","I'd never read anything by this author before but the book looked promising (I enjoy historical and fantasy works). The setting was very realistic, the plot interesting, the characters good and the writing good. However, it misses a 5-star rating becuase it felt like something was lacking. Somehow a distance is created from the characters. None of them feel very close to you or very easy to identify with. There is a general distant feel to the wiriting and the story as though you're watching the events from a distance rather than feeling like you're one of the characters (as some better books allow you to do...like the Mists of Avalon, etc.)"
2,The Sounds of Christmas From Around the World,Not what I expected from Julie Andrews. In my opinion she just wasn't good in this CD. Thought Julie Andrews could sing better.
1,Laughable...,"I bought these to wear with a favorite pencil skirt for a fun retro look. They came out of the packaging with snags! Not to mention the ""seam"" was just a zig-zag stich up the back of the crappiest pair of pantyhose I've ever seen. The ""nylon"" wasn't even a consistent weave -- when I put them on, my husband and I broke out in laughter because it looked like I had mottled legs... at least they were good for a laugh.I didn't expect much for the price, but at any price these are a waste of money as they are completely unwearable and now line the bottom of my trash can."
2,Photo discrepency,"The product arrived quickly and was well packaged, however the back seam in the panty hose is not at all as it appears in the photo. It is barely visible as a seam up close and certainly not visible from a stage to an audience, as I needed."
1,flimsy even for hose!,These snagged while I was putting them on - they are extremely flimsy and poorly crafted. One time use only if you are VERY careful.they just fall apart in your hands!I do not recommend at all.
1,Horrible Hose!,"I bought these for a costume and didn't much care about the quality which wasn't great, but they weren't even seamed on the same side of both legs. One leg had the seam on the back and one leg had the seam on the front. They also weren't real seams. Reading through other reviews, it appears that they just keep this one item up and sell the hose from different suppliers. Mine came from StockingPlus, Inc."
3,Great Price Mediocre Quality,"After searching for backseam pantyhose without contrast (beige on beige) for months, when I saw these offered on Amazon, I jumped and bought five pair. The price was right and buy ordering a large quantity I qualified for free shipping. It was a great deal...if you don't count the quality of the hose. They look all right but the yarn is a bit fuzzy and they tend to cling to any non-slippery fabric. For example, if I wear them under a cotton dress, the hem of the dress will climb my legs as I walk. This can be mitigated a bit by wearing a longer slip, but it doesn't completely prevent the skirt from sticking to the hose and climbing up. I don't regret buying them because I think they will be great for occasional wear and costuming, but I would not buy them again. Instead, I'll keep looking for non-contrast backseam hose that are better quality (a bit more silky) so that I can wear them everyday."
1,From package to garbage,These pantyhose went straight into the garbage once I took them out of the package and saw that they already had pulls in the fabric and the backseam was very linty on the inside. Not even wearable. Not even worth the time and money for a return.
3,"Okay tights, but very flimsy","I was excited to find tights like these for such a cheap price, but the price is reflected in the product. They fit me well (I'm tall and curvy if that helps) and looked great, but the material was thin and I knew they wouldn't last long. Sure enough, I wore them out one night and by the end they had a huge snag. I'm not super disappointed because of the price, but these are maybe best to buy for a one-time use sort of thing like a costume, and not the best to buy if you want to keep them around for a while."
4,backseam pantyhose,Excellent price for this product. Quick delivery. It was exactly what I needed when I needed it.
4,Good but very fragile,"good, my girl does not like how easy it is to get runs in them, but apparently that's party of what these are."
3,Some odd repertoire choices,"I admire this singer and her voice a lot. Her best performance is of a selection of Tchaikovsky arias on an album called ""The Tchaikovsky Experience"". What this lyrico/spinto is doing on this disc in colloratura repertoire associated with Gruberova, Dessai and Sumi Jo, I do not understand.Tracks that weren't disappointing, were merely unremarkable. Lovely floated high notes and the usual punch she packs when needed, are all there, but as a whole the disc failed to excite me."
2,my brand new book had a very noticable ink mark on the cover.,I'm usually quite pleased with Amazon. But this time I was disappointed. I bought a brand new Christmas book for my daughter and it arrived with a very noticable ink mark on the cover. I couldn't figure out how to go about exchanging it from the website so I ended up keeping it. I was not pleased.Kathy Jarvis
5,I am happy I boguth this book,"I absolutely loved this book!! It is great and it really caught me...I understood many more things about my preferite character because of it, and the story was just amazing and also touching. It gives many informations about the characters with all the letters and the pictures wich I loved...I do suggest to buy it because the money are well-spent, believe me!"
3,Text for my daughter,"this was a mandatory buy... a text book for my daughter. We're not thrilled with the class, or the book, but it's in good condition and we'll sell it back when the class is over."
1,Please Spare Yourself!,"This is without a doubt the worst pop punk cd I have ever heard; the three girls just learned their instruments prior to recording this disc, and it shows. Run-of-the-mill pop punk, same old power chords..."
2,Interesting but stereotypical,"I thought the Panama/Colombia Globetrekker DVD was interesting but not a good reflection of Colombia. My wife who is from Colombia thought it offered a slanted view of Bogota as a dangerous, militant city. Instead of showing the more cosmopolitan aspects of the city it was portrayed as dangerous and poor. The visit to the cocaine farm seemed strange since it's illegal. Also the lost city visit and the interview with the sipritual guru who chews coca leaves all day plaued in to the stereotype. Interesting to watch but not up to GT's high standards."
3,Nice phone,"This is a great working phone, however, if you are big into reading caller ID this is NOT the phone for you. I bought it thinking it would be just like the Philips Dect phone I had in Europe but it is not. Sound quality is great, range is fantastic even using Vonage over Time Warner Cable internet.I am sold on Philips Dect phones, just not the display screen on this one."
5,Philips 6.0 Dect Cordless Phone,"This cordless phone has excellent reception. There is no crackling or interference, and it has a good range. I particularly like the fact that you can have up to four handsets. It has plenty of features, and the most pleasant choices for ring tones, so you're not stuck with the normal jarring sound of a ringing phone. I am impressed with the DECT technology."
2,Range good but that is all.,Phone has the best range of any I have tried. With my DSL can't filter out noise. Not user friendly can't talk on both phones at same time with out complicated button manipulation. If you just want a cordless with more range than most and don't have dsl it my be OK? Wife has trouble just answering it and we can't talk on both both phones at the same time. Can use speaker function but not impressed over all.
3,Jury is still out,"Looks - nothing too special or differentSound quality - average to be honest. Not able to turn the volume up high enough for my liking. I am not deaf at all but can't think who would be able to use any other setting other than the highest one. Clear enough,just not loud enoughNavigation - is lifted from the old version of this phone (4 or 5 years I think) and it was always a bit clumsyLoudspeaker - OK for listening but mic cuts in and out all the time.Turning it on and off is easy though.Phone book - like the nav is simply old fashioned.Would I buy this again - No, sorry, I wouldn't. It works but with all aspects decidedly average when phones are so mature then this is not something I would buy again. To be honest I am already looking out for a better one."
3,"GREAT SOUND, TERRIBLE DISPLAY","The in-call functions on this phone system are great---you can call other handsets in the house, conference other handsets into an outside call.The sound quality is also crystal clear.However, the LCD display is LOUSY. It only takes a phonebook entry of about 7 or 8 characters. The actual display quality seems circa 1989--big, blocky letters that are hard tell apart (""is it an R or an A?"").And caller ID is fatally bad--it only displays one line of information on an incoming call--the name, not the number. And the name is usually truncated beyond recognition (""Cell""---that's it!).Great underlying technology--poor implementation. Their european equivalent models are light years ahead of this one"
3,I returned the item,"I was not impressed with the item instantly. So I am sorry to say I did not bother to explore every feature that it offers in order to give a complete review. The sound quality was average. The part the bothers me the most is the display. The font they use needs to be better, I can hardly read what it is saying. I don't have bad eyesight, but you have to scringe to figure out what the words are. That instantly turned me off. It does not work for me. The speakerphone is not loud enough. If you are put on hold and you're waiting for someone to come on line, you have to keep your attention to the phone because you may miss the other party when they speak up."
5,Phone is awesome!,"This phone is small, great battery life, awesome range, and no interference. The features are subtstanial and the quality is amazing. From one that has always had Uniden Cordless phones this is a substantial upgrade."
2,Huge battery drain,"I've had this phone for about 2 years now and I can honestly say that this is not a very good phone. It takes 2 AAA batteries and despite light usage (maybe 1 30min call a week and some short 1-2min calls throughout), I have to recharge the batteries about once a week. I would not recommend placing it back into the charger after every call because it charges pretty hot and that will shorten the battery life of the rechargeables. Call quality is decent but tinny at times.Pros:- multiple phones- answering machineCons:- big battery drain when idle- construction is ok but some of pieces of the LCD display are missing already and I've never dropped the phoneVerdict:If you want just an average phone and don't care about battery life, then this phone may be ok to get for the price. I would not recommend this phone and encourage you to try something else."
2,Great Looks Mediocre Quality,On the shelf this looked like the one. Flat black and a good sized handset. I like having a headphone jack as well. At home the menus were hard to navigate and the connection had static. After a few days of use I'm afraid this one isn't up to the task. I went out and purchased the Panasonic and the sound quality is great... even if it does have a plain Jane aesthetic.
2,Disappointing,"I didn't have problem with a sound or range of the telephone. I had problem with disappointing features of this overpriced telephone. I expected that I would be able to listen an answering machine messages privately through headset when I have ""stranger"" in the house. Wrong! No feature like this! Than, I programmed all my frequently called numbers into the memory of one headset and I wanted to import them into the 3 additional headsets. Wrong! This feature has most of the cheap multi-set wireless phones, but not this one. You would have to program each headset separately. I go to return this telephone and buy Uniden DECT 6.0 that has features I'm looking for and more."
1,"Nice design, but useless","A minimalists' phone for those who appreciate design, especially when considering the garbage sold in the American cordless market (check out similar offerings in Europe and Asia). It is a welcome change from the 'panafonic' usual, but is not up the the design standard of others (Amandana ect). However, no matter how much I want to like this telephone (loved the easily recyclable paper packaging for everything; NO PLASTIC BAGS!), this telephone was UNUSABLE. HEAVY static 10- 20 seconds into every call. This is the second time I was failed by a European handset (Siemens was the first). Returned to store immediately and bought a motorola."
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this phone. I bought a similiar phone while in England and it was the best; so when I saw the same type of phone was now available in the US I was very excited. However, this phone was a disappointment from the start. It is not user friendly when trying to program the phone and the display graphics is similiar to the early 1990's when caller ID first came out...it's like reading lettering from a calculator display. The phone doesn't even show if you have a missed call; the user has to search the menu and review the call log to do this. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
1,I wish there was a zero star category,"OK, so there is no WiFi interference on this phone. Who cares if it is a cheap piece of trash? There is no headphone jack, the handsets are tiny, they have an impossible to read display, it is impossible to use the menus since you can't read the display, the answering machine/base is impossible to use without consulting the maunal, the phones have abysmal sound quality, you can barely hear the caller, need I go on? This phone is a cheap piece of Korean garbage. Avoid it at all costs."
2,Caller ID makes this phone a FAILURE,"The phone has some good qualities... sound quality is good, buttons are easy to use and not overcrowded, answering machine base is slim - doesn't take up much more room than a standard base. However, the caller ID feature is terrible. Only the caller name is displayed during an incoming call, and only the first 8 characters of that!! Often, all we see is ""Maine"" come up on the display. Thanks, that narrows it down to about a million people. The caller ID is one of the most important features and it fails to deliver. For this reason, I cannot recommend this phone and I am trying to find a replacement. Not sure whether to go with Panasonic or Uniden."
5,razor 2000,This bike is really nice. once you put it together it looks great. my son really liked it and took it out and rode it right away.
1,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL RELEASE!,If you can find the first release of this album and you've got somethign..Not that this version isn't cool it's truely awesome and should be had BUT Not near as good as the original worknig of it!so that's why it has 3 stars not 5...David Tibet is a genius and he does a great job of getting special guests for all of his albums..uhmm.. yeah
5,Excellent Product!,"I got one of these as a gift about 4 years ago. I work in EMS and going to a scene of a car accident or a fire I am glad I have it. No melting, no worrying about things being crushed or lost. I even went to 6 flags and went to the water park and left it in my poket of my shorts it got soaking wet without any issues. If I had a regular wallet it would have been ruined. I love mine and bought two to replace the one I have. (I bought two because it was cheaper with shipping and when the bungee finally wears out I have a new one all ready to go.)I did find that if you stretch the bungee to it's max all the time it wears out faster and if you tap the prongs that hold the cover they will slide inside and you may not be able to get them back out. I find that if cards get stuck people tap it to get them out (like my husband) but other then that I love it!"
1,CHEAP,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS COOL AND EVERYTIME I PULLED THIS OUT EVERYONE COMMENTED ON IT AND ASKED WHERE I GOT IT SO THEY COULD GET ONE. HOWEVER, THE PART THAT OPENS TO GIVE YOU A CARD IT HELD TIGHT BY A ""BUNGEE"" CORD AND NOT TO LONG AFTER I WAS USING THIS, THE CORD BROKE. I TIED IT AND MADE IT TIGHT AGAIN EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE CRAP THIS WAY. THE CORD THEN BROKE IN A DIFFERENT AREA. CHEAP PRODUCT."
4,Sturdy Metal Pocket Safe,"This item was given as a Dude gift including personalized fake ID cards like ""McLovin"" Hawaii Drivers license and buddy pics with Obama. Sturdy Metal Pocket Safe"
3,Satisfied,I have had no problem with this card holder. It is functional and sturdy. The only issue I have with it is the size. It is some what bigger than the average card holder.
2,Cheap,"I paid almost the equivalent in shipping costs for this item. Certainly not worth the cost plus shipping - buy yourself lunch instead! Two stars because it works as stated, however, I do not use this item because it does not look very professional - it looks cheap."
1,Have to remove all cards to get one out.,"I purchased this ""credit card case"" and tried putting my cards in it. It will only hold a handful of cards, and if you want one, you are going to have to take them all out and sort through them. For holding so few cards it is also fairly bulky. I could return it, but I have to pay return shipping and a 15% restocking fee, so it is hardly worth it. This would probably be fine for business cards, but I would not call it a credit card holder."
5,This thing is great,"I have used one of these daily for four or five years now, and it works great. Just about to order a replacement, as I've used mine so much the cords have stretched out too far. Very eye-catching too -- people are always asking me what it is. Highly recommended!"
2,poor design,"I was looking for a solution to bent cards in my wallet, but this product wasn't a usable solution. One issue is that it is comparatively bulky for the few number of credit cards it will hold, but the bigger issue is that the aluminum sleeve is the same length as the cards, so once cards are inserted they don't protrude, and you can't grip them to remove them. If you're using it for credit cards, and you load it up to capacity such that they don't easily slide out, that's a problem. They could have easily have made the aluminum portion shorter, and the removable plastic end-cap longer.In fairness, if you are using this for its likely intended purpose of storing paper business cards, and plan to carry it in some larger case, rather than a pocket, it's perfectly suitable. Not what I happened to be looking for, but that's how I've ended up using it."
3,Fun card holder,"Intially I thought I could keep cash and cards, but it doesn't fit. I thought I could replace my wallet but not to be so. Still when I want to go my a short trip and don't want to carry too much, it works."
2,Material not soft,These sheets are very thick and feel more like a drapery material. They are still stiff after multiple washings. They are not nice soft material like I was hoping for.
5,pawling5,"Young artistic and adventurous author lives with African hunter-gatherer tribe, participating in all their activities including night hunts with bow and poison-tipped arrows. Even lions are fair game, although who eats whom can be an open question. Tribe members love to sing, dance, hunt and tell stories. They never think about tomorrow. The reader gets a very different view of human nature - without the encumbrances of civilization. Some of the tales are heartwarming. All are interesting. Its sad to think that this tribe will soon vanish. Book is graced by fascinating illustrations of collaborative paintings made by the author and various tribe members. A thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking read."
2,Poor blade edge design,"The edge is shaped like a chopping tool (axe, sword) but the knife is far too small to be a good chopper. The edge needs to be re-profiled into a slicing edge. I tried to cut wood with it but it couldn't do that, and it just tore through the paper.The handle is small. I have very small hands and the handle was barely long enough and too thin, which made holding it very uncomfortable. My fingers wrapped all the way around the handle and touched my palm and my hand began to feel cramped after holding it for about 5 minutes.The sheath is great. Definitely one of the better sheaths out there with many options for securing it.The full sized Ka-bar is an excellent knife, but making it 25% smaller was a bad idea.I gave it 2 stars because the sheath is great, if not for the sheath I would have given it 1 star."
3,not a great survival knife,"sure, full tang, but not full width tang, so it has been known to be prone to breaking at the base of the blade, esp. when prying. also, a bit short for baton-ing decent sized small logs; another inch or two of blade would probably be ideal. the clip point is terrible for batoning because it is sharp enough to get stuck into the baton. the top part of the guard HAS to come off if you want to use it for survival. i wrapped paracord around the handle because it was a bit too small for my average hands. also, i'm not so sure that the scandi grind that this knife has is best for splitting wood or chopping, and it is definitely inferior for other tasks. I'm now looking at other knives to replace this one in my camping gear. I'll probably get a mora triflex for for small tasks, and maybe a rat 7 or an esee 6 for the big stuff if i can justify the expense..."
3,"Good voices, poor sound","This is a Live recording made in Rome in 1952. Sound quality is very poor, as you can imagine. On the other hand, you can hear Filippeschi singin' some of the most difficult arias around (""a te o cara"" and ""credeasi misera""). He's got a very powerful voice, and it shines all the way up to the famous D. A pity that he can't stress too much his voice being a live performance and has to restrains a little.But maybe the real surprise is Panerai: ""or dove fuggo mai"" is simply incredible. It's probably the best baritone I've heard in this part."
5,Great,"These utensils are beautiful and feel great in your hand. Having had rust problems with other sets, we've decided to hand wash them (as opposed to putting them in the dishwasher). After one month's use, we are very happy with them."
1,Poor Product and Customer Service,"Bought this flatware for Christmas gift. During the FIRST WASH in the dishwasher, MULTIPLE items (forks and knives) had RUST SPOTS. We were refered BY THE SELLER CLSALES (part of Craigslist)- to return the items, we were wondering if we should try returning just the rusty ones, but they said we had to pay for all shipping, so we returned the set for a refund. We contacted the seller SEVERAL TIMES over 2 MONTHS, FINALLY I was refunded only HALF of the sale price, (around $48, they said there was a 45% RESTOCKING FEE!! I paid over $115 with both way shipping)- RIDICULOUS! Very difficult to work with customer service- they would not give me a phone number to follow up. VERY UNHAPPY!!"
1,"Smells bad, bottle NOT as pictured, and unprofessional seller!","Please don't waste your money on this disgusting and misrepresented product. This oil smells more like an old lady than honeysuckle! The smell is awful. But besides that, I ordered this as a gift based on the pretty roll-on package shown here. The package I received was an ugly square bottle with an ugly label that looked like it came from a label-maker. I would not want to give OR receive this as a gift.I contacted the seller (with a polite request to return the item) who closed my return request stating simply ""fragrance."" Now I'm having to go through the A-Z process and even if I get my money back will be out the shipping amount, which was more than the item itself. I hate leaving negative reviews and I am a loyal Amazon customer, but I want to save someone else from wasting their money on this misrepresented product and extremely unprofessional seller."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This product smells absolutely NOTHING like honeysuckle. When I asked to return the product, the reply was ""this seller has closed your return request"", ie, tough luck! I do realise that this is not an expensive product but by God it should at least smell something resembling the product description instead of what it really smells like...urine.In the garbage it goes."
2,Authors trying to cash in on new technology...good intro tho,"While the book has a good introduction about JSR 168, it doesn't go into too much detail considering that this is a Professional series book. They gloss over the products and do not talk about pitfalls and gotchas. They obviously know what they are talking about... but you probably want to wait for the next wave of Portal technology books."
1,"Professional Portal Development with Open Source Tools: JavaTM Portlet API, Lucene, James, Slide",Sorry for bad review but book is not for Professional but novice users and managers.
5,An important text for portal development,This book helped me overcome some difficulties I had in my new portal development tasks and in understanding some of the basic concepts needed for developing portlets within/without a portal framework. This book is definitely worth a look for those interested in portal creation.
4,A very good book,The content of this book is top notch. Each chapter stands alone as an insightful overview of a particular topic (like Lucene).But the chapters are not tied together into a cohesive whole. I still highly recommend the book but it is not what you may think it is. You are not going to get a working portal from this book.
1,An utter waste of time and money,"Having read the book description I was excited by what this book might have to offer. As it turned out I was utterly disappointed with my purchase.I think the word ""Professional"" listed in the title of the book is totally misleading. There is nothing professional about this piece of trash. The authors appear to have done little more than scrape together as much open-source documentation as they could muster, with very little original material to hold it all together. Explanations are either poorly written or very thin on content, there is no flow between chapters, and basically no focus to the book. Just a mish-mash of technology descriptions wrapped up in a Wrox cover.Overall I would rate this as one of the worst IT books I have every bought, and I've collected plenty over the last few years. If you're after a decent portal development book you'll be disappointed/annoyed with this one."
2,Pump head,This pump head is a little hard to use and for the price your better of buying a good quality air pump.
2,Not really good for presta,"It worked OK on schraeder side, but Presta side was not good.1. The yellow lever is awkward compared to standard ""flip-up"" lock.2. More importantly, at high pressure of road tires the air starts leaking through the Schraeder side as you approach the peak PSI.I returned it and got Blackburn Air Tower 2 for $22. It has two separate holes too, but the design is slightly different and seems to be working better with Presta valves."
5,great so far,"Bought this to upgrade the pump I bought,,,works great,,,releases fast with little air loss. The lock mech/lever is a bit tricky as it's a bit large, but nothing bad."
5,Topeak Twinhead is well made,"This product is very solid and well made. It seals Presta and Schrader valves very well. When you release the value, it disengages right away so there's no pressure loss. So var it's a very nice upgrade for my Joe Blow pump. A lot better quality than the original valve. I'd recommend this to anyone, and I'm hard to please."
3,"does the job, seems to be quality",fixed the worst part of an otherwise great pump. Had the swivel head (terrible idea) seems to be much tougher and better executed.
1,Only good for a few months,I've gone through 2 of these twinhead replacement heads in the last couple months. Something happens when you frequently pump presta tubes. All of the sudden the twinhead fails and air goes out the Shrader side. Growing very tired of having a ride delayed or eliminated because the twinhead behaves so badly!
1,This book is a joke,"This book is a joke. Not only is it full of outrageous claims that are not referenced to any reliable sources, but it even contains glaring spelling errors. To name a few: Domino, non sum dingus, p. 9 (instead of Domine, non sum dignus); Alexis Comnena, p. 33 (instead of Alexius Comnenus); Emich of Leisengen, p. 41 (instead of Emicho of Leiningen). This author is a storyteller, not a historian. Don't waste your money on this book if you want an accurate history of the Crusades. Instead, read articles and books by Thomas F. Madden, Ph.D. He is a historian who actually specializes in the Crusades."
1,"Disgusting picture drawings, obvious bias against faith & Christianity.","I thought I could get a nice overview of the Crusades, but because of the author Paul Williams Ph.D's penchant for negating ideology, the volume negated credibility. He surely knows belief's current in the age, yet looks back with an attitude from the antiChristian era of his mindset.An unusable text."
4,Crusading,"Having just watched the ""Kindom of Heaven"", I was very interested in learning more about this periord of history. I found many books on the subject, but most were very dry and hard to get into. I picked up a copy of the Idiot's Guide to the Crusades and believe it or not, I could not put it down. This book is not a scholarly work but is very entertaining and well presented. The title of this book is deceiving. Few idiots would take on a subject matter like this. My only criticism is that it does not contain more maps and pictures. For the amount of people involved in the crusades, it's hard to keep track of who is who."
5,This is a great book,"Im not sure why certain reviewers hated this book so much. I really enjoyed it and bought it as a gift for my nephew. He loved it. This book is funny, interesting and easy to read. Its also one of my FAVORITE books. I dont care if some academic chair jockey has problems with the correctness of the history. Who wrote history anyway? Some Boring Academic. Well go read something boring then! This book was very enjoyable and interesting. If that sounds like something you would like to read then pick it up. I for one am tired of being lulled to sleep by ""Researched experts"". The reason no one reads their books is because they dont know how to write a story. This book keeps you interested and brings the people involved in the history of the crusades to life. Nuff said."
2,Muslims' Butts Kicked,"The Christian knights whipped the Muslims' butts in four Crusades. Liked it, skimmed whole book in 2 sittings."
3,Missing Stone!,"I was so excited when I received this ring in the mail, only to be disappointed when I discovered that one of the smaller stones was missing. I also think that the silver looks a little fake. I contacted the company and they told me send it back for a refund."
4,Very pleased with this set,"This is the 3rd wedding band set I've had since I got married in 2009. The first one was rhodium - turned my finger green. The second was white-gold plated - turned my finger green. I finally decided I was going to stick with sterling silver. I found this set and fell in love immediately. I have not had any issues with it, and I've worn the set daily for over a year. All of my friends keep telling me they are jealous that I've got such a beautiful bridal set (and they all think it's loaded with diamonds, so even better!)Only downside is that it gets dirty very quickly, and take a lot of elbow grease to get the black marks off the bottom of the bands, even with regular cleaning."
2,Not very original,"This dvd is full of weight lifting exercises that I'm sure one can find on every website that covers the subject. Not one I haven't seen before. The description says the dvd contains numerous ""weight lifting and bodyweight"" exercises. The former is true, but I remember seeing only one bodyweight exercises on the entire DVD. I guess what makes the program unique is the massive amounts of reps per workout that it prescribes. I didn't bother to work out the math but it seems that each workout consists of a approx. 1000 reps of various heavy lifts. I would love to know how many hours this takes to complete. Even if one did have the time, how long before overtraining is a problem? Not long, I would think, unless steroids are a regular part of your routine. I also did not appreciate the two phony 5 star reviews listed here. If you check the other products these two reviewers have listed, they are all from the same company that puts out this DVD."
1,Bring back the original,I agree 1000% with everyone else on here who said the original was sooooo much better. I can't even eat it now. Why did they have to ruin it?
1,Chewy Blueberries,"I never tried this cereal before, like some of the others entering comments, so I can't compare it to an earlier version. To me, the blueberries had a chewy and rubbery texture that was totally unappealing. Based on the ingredients, I should have liked it, but I won't be buying it again."
1,why?!,"yes, this cereal has certainly gone down the tubes. It was once my favorite.., heaps of crunchy nut clusters.., almonds a-plenty.., and extra amounts of sundried blueberries..i wouldnt have bought it the other day if i knew they were changing it..now its like bland rice krispy looking things with like 2 almonds and 2 blueberries IN THE WHOLE BOX. i have yet to find a nut cluster..what a disappointment"
1,Cereal's decription does not match reality,"Cereal USED to have crunchy flakes, blueberries, almonds, little granola clusters. It was great and I would have given it 5 stars. Now it has next to no almonds or blueberries, and the flakes are basically Rice Krispies! Don't waste your money."
1,Hope Post doesn't ruin its other Select cereals like they did this one,Don't waste your money on this limp imitation of what used to be Blueberry Morning. The flakes have the worst taste and texture ever and it would be nice to have more than two almonds in a bowl. My kids always ask why we don't get the blueberry cereal anymore. At least the banana and cranberry Post cereals are still good.
3,not much romance....,"Synopsis as described by other reviewers (I bought this book due to the 'glowing' reviews). Paris Grantham eventually lost her virginity to Edward 'Teddy''a neat freak - who shuddered at the thought of letting her loose in his walk-thru closet'. In the end they didn't get married because it turned out he didn't love her, once he understood she wouldn't finance his lifestyle. Too much information?... Poor girl (with bad judgement?) such a bad experience with a loser... I like a happy romance so this book is not for me."
3,not so great - unfortunetly,"Best for Gaming with my PS3. Blue ray looks great. EVERYTHING else is not so good at all! even 1080i dvds do not look very good on my sony upscale dvd player using hdmi. analog tv is absolutely horible. it has issue reproducing ANY image that is not 1080p. AND IT DOES NOT UPSCALE ALL IMAGES TO 1080p LIKE IT SAYS IT DOES. (GENESES TECHNOLOGY) ITS BS. IM TRYING TO SEND MINE BACK BUT IT COST 250 TO SENT IT BACK INCLUDING 10 PERCENT RESTOCK FEE. if you want a good all round tv, dont get this."
3,Enjoyable but....,"The Horus Killings is a quick read. Unlike the work of Pauline Gedge, I found the work somewhat devoid of detailed setting and character study. If you are seeking to read a book involving Ancient Egypt and are quite focused on plot, you will enjoy this book. It's an enjoyable mystery, full of suspense. Do not look for more than this because I fear you will not find it."
4,History as the basis for mystery,"Set in the early years of the rule of Hatchepsut (Egyptian New Kingdom, 18th Dynasty), this is a good tale filled with a wealth of historical information. P.C. Doherty is one of the most respected (and most prolific) writers of historical mysteries. He has a masterful talent for bringing accurate historical details to life for the 21st century reader--and creating memorable characters that you either love or hate. The plot here is rather thin, but the resolution is ultimately satisfying.If you are looking for a non-fiction reference to the historical period covered in this novel, you might want to see ""Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh"" by Joyce Tyldesley. It is a very accessible biography and analysis of this fascinating woman."
5,dd,"I would recommend this book, Horus Killings, by Paul Dohehty. The reader is walking beside Lord Amerotke, Pharaoh's Chief Judge, in all of his investigations of murdered victims. The reader is learning the history of Ancient Egypt. The book is a fast read, and the reader is ready for his next book."
5,Fun Romance,This is a must read and a book you will read over and over.Nancy tells the traditional tale of the eldest daughter being forced to marry first but gives it a clever twist.
4,Good Mini Book for Baby Hands,We bought this for my 9m old daughter and she loves turning the pages and looking at the bright pictures of the animals. It is small and chunky so it is perfect for little hands.I only gave it 4 out of 5 because it is really just a picture book and doesn't have much other text. It is good for what it is.
4,"A Terrifying, Difficult Trek","Along with his sister ""band"" Nurse with Wound's mid-80's release ""Homotopy to Marie,"" this is the only record I've ever heard that has come close to what you might call ""scaring the crap out of"" me. In all seriousness, though, even after my 4 years of having owned the album, I still can't make it through the whole thing. It's not something you'll me likely to listen to more than a few times; but some of the best albums ever made have been of that sort.This is certainly the scariest ""Christian"" music ever recorded, if one could call it that."
2,quit showing off,"David Tibet says: ""Look at me, everybody, I'm evil! I can say words like 'war' and 'darkness' and put the word 'blood' in half the titles of everything I say! Plus I can do nasty growly voices that would have been compared to Marilyn Manson if he had existed when this album was originally released!""Actually, some of the music is interesting. ""St. Peter's Keys All Bloody"" has some interesting stuff based on Simon and Garfunkel songs. But overall, it's tedious. If you're looking for structured noise, you'd probably do better with Nurse With Wound."
4,Liked it,"Had heard this work mentioned many times and seen some scenes of it, but this is my first exposure to the whole thing. Lesley Collier, Michel Coleman, Brian Shaw, Garry Grant, and specially Lesley Collier and John Lanchbery and the orchestra present a great performance. The ensemble numbers are somewhat less than perfect in choreography, execution and camera aim. Quite an entertaining presentation of a venerable stage show."
2,well viewed tape,"This tape has been watched so many times that it is snowy, I was not able to watch it completely once. This was my First and Last purchase of a used tape or DVD"
2,Small Sacrifices,"The movie was good, but the tracking on the vhs was bad. The movie was really good though.Ramona Olson"
3,BREN,I RECEIVED THE VHS TAPE PROMPTLY. tHE CONDITION OF THE TAPE WAS FAIR CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE TAPE. THE PRODUCT UPON VIEWING WAS GRAINY BUT I WAS STILL ABLE TO VIEW IT.
1,not good,"This movie was not up to Amazons standards the picture and sound isnt clear.Its not worth the money,the box is plain not like shown,didnt arrive when it said it would. Very unhappy with this dvd."
2,Movie Small Sacrifices,"I waited for this movie to come out on DVD for so long. I was so disappointed when I did receive this. The movie disc itself looks like a burnt copy. It also did not come with a cover for the case. It had a piece of paper that had the movie title on it. For the amount of money I paid for it, I expected a new movie in a case. At least this seller could let you know what you will be getting for the money you are spending. I love Amazon and want them to know about this seller."
2,Bootleg!,"As the seller admitted, it is not a dvd factory product. Far from it! The case is completely generic, and the dvd was made by lightscribe... For the price, I expected much more than what was sent..."
2,Dissappointed,The toy comes with three figures but only one fits on the truck.There are two spaces at the front of the truck but only Ike can fit because the other two figures don't have round bottoms. The other two don't fit securly anywhere on the truck. It's also a disappointment that the dog does not look much like he belongs on a fire truck. The truck has five knobs that stick up from the truck to hold these figures but as I stated before only one fits. I think the truck and the figures were designed by two different people and they've never met!
2,the people don't fit,"This is a great fire truck, but the fire fighters and dog do not fit in/on the allotted slots."
3,Disappointed...,"My 23 month old son recently received this as a gift. It looks great, but it has lots of flaws. The basket at the end of the ladder doesn't stay in place. The people and the dog fall out almost immediately. When my son put the fire fighter in the driver's seat, he didn't stay in place very well, either. My son loved the toy, but, as a parent, I was very disappointed."
4,Good Job!!,"This was a fun book to read, the writer really has a way of making the characters come alive. You feel as though you are right there with everything that is happening. It was a book that once you started to read it you just couldn't seem to put it down, and when you did you couldn't wait to pick it up and start reading it again. The author really keeps it moving and keeps you all the time in suspense. Congratulations on a well read book, looking forward to your next one. Keep up the good work."
5,Fantastic deal.,Ordered this replacement part for a friend who was broke down and low on cashflo. Worked out great and price/quality was on point. Thanks again Amazon Prime.
3,scholarly work,"Although this poet is a well known Japanese author, I found this collection to be a bit tedious. The notes and back history included are well researched and written. The choice of poems themselves was in need of a wider range. The one poem ""the child"" for which the poet is well known, was not included. The overall emotion was dark and moody, leaving me with less than an enjoyable experience. There are many small books on Japanese poetry that are far more beautifully written with evocative imagery. I would suggest you buy ""Tangled Hair"" and stay away from this one."
3,"scenic, but dull","has little dialogue, but beautifully scenic. slow and peaceful to watch... for those looking for any kind of action, this is not the movie for you."
5,Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring Korean Movie DVD,"I bought this for someone as a Christmas gift. The DVD came in very quickly and in brand new perfect quality as it should. I heard the movie is very very good. It got incredible ratings. Recommend for anyone who loves foreign, romance, drama movies."
4,Excellent artist,"I heard Jeff Peterson live on a recent trip to hawaii. The sounds he produces with his guitar are mind boggling. I purchased two of these cd's., one for the car and one for the house. Fantastic!"
3,Co2 home brew,"I wouldn't bother buying this as you can easily recharge your canister with yeast & baking soda. We have the Hagen Co2 setup that this product is for and my husband tried making his own mix by filling the canister as usual with the prescribed sugar and lukewarm water and added a 1/4 teaspoon of breadmaking yeast granules and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and it works great.That said, the Hagen unit is great value, but the ""activator"" is merely yeast granules and the ""stabilizer"" merely baking soda, (NOT baking powder). For the cost of these little packets, you can buy a jar of yeast and a box of baking soda that will be many times the amount you get in the packets. But hey, if you can't be bothered with measuring, go for it!"
4,Excellet product but the price,"I have been using this product for at least three years now. I have to say is and excellent way to improve the grow, colors and health of your plants (almost to good).The only considerations you have to take are:1- Install it in a place where you can easily access to maintain it (careful with the water)2- Regular measure the water Ph and Kh (it drops both because of the CO2). Consider to use only during the day period of your aquarium.3- Make a little research about the best aquarium light you can use to improve the C02 effect.4- Wait three weeks for the results.5- You will have to regular cut the long leafs (depending of your plants).6- Consider quit the active carbon if your using liquid of pills plants activators.The price is a little high but the results are really good if you have a plan and good practices with your tank."
5,Illustrated Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt,"Accessible three ways: through the index, through keywords in boldface type, or through alphabetic browsing, it also is organized into ""trails"" one can follow to discover information about a particular topic, e.g. work or everyday life. Uneven coverage, for example, under the entry for Nile, all that is written is ""the main river of Egypt"". However, the entry for Hieroglyphs and writing is 2 pages long. Notwithstanding, there is still much information of value, especially regarding Egyptian gods. Author lectures at Oxford University."
3,Bad Choices,"Baxter centers her story around the choices and actions of a young woman, Cassie Worthan, raised in a 1950's mentality in the deep south. Finding herself pregnant by an old friend of the family, she seeks a remedy to her shame by marrying a high school boyfriend who knows he is not the father of the baby. Later when she discovers his obsession with guns and radical militants, she leaves him and hides from him for nine long years.Like so many people, Cassie is torn between pleasing her righteous father, social conscious mother and her love for her child. Throughout the story, Baxter emphasizes the importance of loving and pleasing oneself first."
1,"Wow, it will destroy your work!","I've used VSS for years, just started using it again, the 2005 version with VS2005 and 2008. I've had nothing but trouble. Corruption, checking out files for no reason when I do a sync, and today it just overwrote about 20 files I had checked out with their old versions. If I didn't have backups - I'd have lost weeks of work.Obviously I don't recommend anyone use this product! It's horrible. I've had trouble for weeks with coworkers and my work getting messed up on the servers because of errors with this software. Today is the final straw."
5,"Quick service, everything as promised.","Fast delivery as promised, product for as great price. Will use again."
2,"birds of the carolinas, 2nd ed.",The pictures were too small and some of the birds did not have a picture to wiew.
4,Birds of the Carolinas,"Overall, an excellent book - my only complaint is that the bird pics are a little on the small side."
2,The basic plots are good but read the books,"Like most Star Trek stories the underlying messages are good. The big problem was the time limit to the films, too much has been cut out leaving the story thin and somewhat uninspiring. I recommend to all trekkies collect the series but also buy the books"
3,Ok but not the Best episodes,"""Bem"" Was not a good episode, Commander Bem himself is dumb and foolish, and the end is not a good one. Kirk disregards the alien enity's warning to leave and then she (the enity) is Ok with it, get real! ""Albatross"" was a pretty good episode for the most part."
3,OK puzzle,"This puzzle is small and cheap feeling but hey, the kid likes it. Unfortunately when you open it up you get little bits of fluorescent paint all over the floor. The 3-d is ok but not anything like the picture you see at the beginning of this review. So don't expect much."
5,Marvelous Writing,"This is the best anthology of Filipino writing I've seen so far. The editors Tabios and Carbo deserve medals for bringing us such rich, diverse, exciting women poets & writers. I love Jessica Zafra's story, I was gripped by Cristina Pantoja-Hidalgo's stunning story, I was overwhelmed by all the fantastic poetry, especially ""Marcelina"" by Jean V. Gier. All women will understand the stories these Filipinas have to tell. Highly recommended!"
5,About Time,I am so happy to see this collection of Filipina (!) writers. Way to go! Now it's time to see these individual writers produce their own books so that we will have more to show the world. It is very encouraging to know that there are many writers of Filipino background out there. Get busy! I highly recommend this collection to those of you who simply love to read.
4,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BABY SHE PUT'S IT OUT THERE !,IF YOUR NOT SURE ABOUT THIS CD DONT BE !.. IT'S THE REAL DEAL IF YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR A DANCE VERSION OF THIS SONG.. I DONT FEEL ALL HER WORK BUT SHE DID HER THING HERE SO GET A COPY !
4,KYB KG5444 Gas Shock (Front),"We installed these KYB KG5444 shocks on my son's 2001 Nissan Frontier truck. He says they are GREAT..made a huge difference over the Gabriels taken off. One thing to consider..these shocks do not come compressed . To get them in place (very tight fit) I had to manually compress them by placing the upper rod end on the driveway and pushing down with all my 220 lbs of weight and strap them with several very large (175 lb strength) cable tie wraps, get them in place with bottom bolt installed and upper rod with lower bushing in place through top bracket hole, and then cut the tie wraps to allow them to de-compress."
3,Lower Voltage,"When I purchased this disc of Klemperer's 1955 mono performance of Symphony No. 3, I also possessed the EMI ""Klemperer legacy"" 1998 re-release of the 1959 stereo recording.To me, this earlier recording is disappointing. The sound is boxy and claustrophobic--quite unlike the ""legacy"" remastering, which is far more forward and dynamic. While the tempi and flow of the earlier performance make it more cohesive, much of the granitic power often cited as the hallmark of Klemperer's Beethoven is sacrificed. If you can still obtain the ""legacy"" release, you might want to pass on this one or consider obtaining both performances."
5,What a great sand box!,"We have had this toy for a few years now. It is great!! The first winter, we kept it inside filled with packing peanuts as a sensory experience. It has now been outside in a partially protected (under a swingset/clubhouse)area. It is big enough for 2 or 4 kids to play with, just not big enough for all of the kids to sit in, unless they are all young (12 months - 18 months) children. The cover is difficult for young (2 - 2 1/2 years)ones to put back on themselves, but they are able to get the lid off by themselves. It is durable - my daughter has stood on the lid numerous times, but it is from Little Tikes, so I would have been very disappointed if it wasn't durable."
3,Good historical look at these pieces,"Definitely old recordings, but a nice look at historical clarinet players. Cahuzac and Benny Goodman are the highlights for me."
5,LIfe in pink,"I thought I was the one who would enjoy this DVD the most, since Pink Panther was my favorite cartoons when I was little, well Surprise!...My 5 years old son fell in love with this Pink Panther collection! A good to have DVD."
5,"yeah, great find","our daughter is loving the pink panther and all his doings. fun, worthy old cartoons."
3,Good cartoon buit its inferior to some of the live action PP films,The ones with Peter Sellers. Those films are considered to be the funniest ever by many critics ever in many countries.
4,Excellent and refreshingly brief discussion of turbulence,"This book ranks among the classics for people who actually work with turbulent flows. It is a brief but well composed discussion of many of the most fundamental concepts describing turbulence. It is approachable and accurate. It is slightly dated and does not provide as many modeling details as would be useful, but it is excellent as a conceptual discussion."
3,A First Course in Turbulence,"This book is a ""classic"" in the field of turbulence. However, I cannot recommend it to anyone who is not a collector. The content is not particularly useful to the fluids engineer who must deal with practical issues of turbulent flow. Nor is this book the best reference for a PhD student or research scientist who must dig into the details. A much better choice for any reader in fluid dynamics is the the book on Turbulent Flow by Pope."
4,Good Intro to Turbulence,"Tennekes and Lumley provide a very good introductory look into turbulent fluid flow. If you only have one turbulence book on your shelf, this is a good one."
3,Introductory level textbook,"A good basic textbook about turbulent fluid flows, recommended for undergraduate and early graduate students. Not a high-level reference (should look at Hinze's for that) and a few topics, ideas, etc. are somewhat outdated now."
5,Gates T228 Timing Belt,"I bought this Timing Belt together with the head gasket kit, and am very happy with it. I had no problem whatsoever installing this belt. I was told that this is an OEM for some Mazda cars. It is way lot cheaper than the dealer price, and is very pleased that I saved myself a bundle."
1,Horrible,"Forced to read in college. Absolutely incoherent ramblings. Terrible writing, astrocious editing and poor research make this book a professor's dream and a student's nightmare."
4,I used this to get around in a village w/almost no English,"I spent 25 days in West Bengal with this book on me at all times. After leaving Calcutta, I found very few people who could speak much English. As it was designed for, it was fast to use to find a phrase, and pretty easy to be understood when reading. I needed few words that were not included in the book. I intend to use phrasebooks every time I want to learn a language - before I leave for the country."
1,Sanyo So Called 1 Hour Charger,"Received charger yesterday it states ""1 Hour Super Quick Charging"" on package! I found out after opening package that recharging the 4 2500 mha batteries that came with unit took 3 HOURS to charge NOT 1 HOUR! In very tiny printing on the back top right corner of the package shows recharging times! I needed a magnifying glass to read it! 1-2 1700 mha batteries takes 55 minutes and 4 1700 mha takes 110 minutes! So you can see the higher the MHA the longer it takes to charge them! I'll stick to the Ray-O-Vac 1 Hour charger it charges in 60 to 65 minutes!"
4,fast but not 1 hr,"This is a much faster charger than my old one. however it is not 1hr at least for battery >1600mAHit may take up to 2-3hr for 2000-2500mAhr.the battery is OK, it seems it may not hold much, not as good as some of my 2000mAh. However I only used them couple times, so i maybe worng on that."
4,good recharger,This is a good charger for the money i spent. No Complaints. As mentioned the package arrived and no problems.
4,Recharges quickly and lasts a long time,I got these as part of a deal with a fuji s700 and they work great. Took a little over and hour to charge and allowed me to take tons of pictures. Probably over 400 pictures with about 30% of those using flash.
3,Charge does not seem to last long,Comparing to regular alkaline battery this rechargeable battery last about 3/4 to 1/2 as a regular battery. The charger work fine but I don't think it can charge 2 battery in one hour as stated. Takes longer to charge with 4 battery
2,Battery charger,It came in a open package. It was used. Didn't send back because of shipping cost. Would not buy from them again. It was suppose to be a new product.
4,Was a fantastic buy,"The batteries last longer than I'll ever need for my couple dozen snapshots. Like people say, it can take up to 3 hours to charge 4 but that doesn't bother me. Partially charged batteries recharge faster. I had one battery that had a mysterious white coating. Took one month to get a replacement but they sent me 4, and I only need 2 for my camera so there was no inconvenience. Too bad the price has gone up about 2x."
5,Great,Fit right into my dash without any issues and didn't look different than my car interior. I would by from this place again.
5,great story great movie,"Excellent animation, it looks like a famous paint in movement, the story is great. if japanese or americans would come with such an amazing skills the world of anime movies will be reborn. viva la France"
3,Great Story,"My daughter loves Anime Movies and watched this on Christmas Day. Not sure if it was the disc or a sign our DVD player is going bad, but it played poorly about halfway through. Other DVD's have played fine so I suspect it is the DVD"
5,Artistic movie destined to be a classic,"In a movie medium dominated by Disney, A Cat in Paris stands out amongst the princess and kid movies as a something child-friendly, yet still enjoyable by adults who like animated features. The characterization is fun, the plot is exciting with a touch of comedy, and the animation if fresh. A great watch for someone looking for a less common type of movie."
2,A Life of Crime in Paris,"The title and cover art are beautifully benign and the caricatures' facial features and deliberately distorted body shapes are fun to watch, the Paris night sky is beautiful, the cat plays a cute, mysterious role but the real story is of gun-toting gangsters who have killed the cat's little-girl-owner's policeman father. The little girl is so bereft that she is mute. Her mother is a detective also, so the looming threat throughout is whether the gangsters get the rest of the family as well. The good nanny is really a bad nanny. A good guy is mistaken for the real criminals but hopefully good triumphs over evil by the film's end. In the meantime the casual use of weaponry is frightening and objectionable. I do not recommend this film for children under 12."
4,"Sprighlty tale of cops and robbers, a cat, and a kid","The style of animation is not one I especially appreciate. That's quickly forgotten though as I became absorbed in the sprightly tale of cops and robbers, life and death, a cat and a kid, all set to a vivacious score. There are some dark themes touched on but the story bounces along without dwelling in the dark places for long."
3,Disappointing,"We expected something comparable to ""Ratatouille"". Although interesting and done with clever animation, it became a bit trite and boring."
1,"Not worth the time or money, no customer service","Do NOT buy from this seller! Do NOT buy this pen! I received this 8 panel gogo exercise pen and had hoped that it would work as solution for containing my 9-month old Maltipoo. She knocked it over immediately. We had planned to use it in the house, but that isn't possible. It must be staked down to work. We also ordered the top for it, and it was so flimsy and poorly made it fell in to the pen, fortunately, my dog wasn't in it!I went through Amazon to get return authorization. Request was submitted on 10/19/11. Resubmitted on 10/21/11. Resubmitted on 10/24/11. No response from Dig It (the seller), other than to ask me why I wanted to return it. No authorization has been received to date. I don't hold them responsible for the flimsiness of the product, but I do expect Customer Service within 48 hours, as Amazon promised. I will not do business with this seller, and I have so advised my dog-owning friends."
5,To bardzo dobra ksiazka! Dla mnie to **********,Jest to naprawde dobra pozycja. Mialem okazje korespondowac z autorem i jest to naprawde mily gosc! Ksiazka jest prawdziwa skarbnica wiedzy. Jest dobrze ilustrowana. Jej poziom merytoryczny jest naprawde wysoki. Na polskim rynku trudno bedzie znalesc taka pozycje(Przepraszam wszystkich za brak polskich znakow diakrytycznych ale to wina systemu informatycznego Amazon. Polskie znaki zmieniane sa na krzaki i dlatego z nich zrezygnowalem)
5,Works VERY well! Amazing little device,"I was skeptical about how this might or might work because it is so simple.But, it works really well! I used this with a LED MagLite Mini (AA), and it's a superior bike light to that of almost any other 'bike light'. The light stays in place, doesn't rattle or move around, it's quick to put on and take off of the bike, and it's very versatile. It's nice being able to simply use a high quality flashlight (you might already have) and just buy this mount.Anyways, I would highly recommend this to a friend."
4,An arresting performance,"This is one of Britten`s starkest scores, not the ""fluidity"" of Grimes or the sensuality of Venice.But, great music.As this is largely a static plot, no much movement goes on stage.The staging is very restrained, with distinct japanese influences.The singing and acting are very good, so why only 4 stars? ENO gets the full 5, but Kultur, alas... The rransfers are good, but not more. Why in the name of G do they not include subtitles? It`s essential, even for an opera sung in English. So, for the future PLEASE!"
2,A Barebones Presentation,"I strongly second the previous reviewer's strong objection to the lack of surtitles.Very few words were understandable even if the singers are singing in English. This was especially so with the female singers. The packaging contains only the titles of a few arias or scenes; no summary of the story is available. The names of the singers are given on the outside package but not their roles. It appears that this DVD is designed only for those who know this obscure opera well. The production is again bareboned and in modern dress. Without aid from the producers, who and what is going on is mostly unclear. It's good that there is a DVD available for this opera, but it is largely unsatisfactory for anyone other than a Britten expert."
2,disappointed,"We bought this light for our master bathroom and unfortunately, we were in the middle of a remodel when we purchased it and did not take the time to inspect the light prior to us missing our ""window of return"". Very disappointed to find that portions of the light were crooked and the overall quality of the light is poor for the cost. We also bought the four light version and it was also crooked and came with a broken shade. Would not recommend. Just purchased two lights from JC Penny's for my boys' bathrooms for $20 each and they are head and shoulders nicer than the Seagull light and at a fraction of the cost."
3,Steptoe Max.,"Despite doses of slapstick, and the familiar banter between father and son, this is actually rather a sad film. The central theme of the television series (Harold held back by loyalty to his selfish father) was always levened by some homely BBC sets and only the most blousy and superficial love interest for Harold. In this cinema spin-off however, Harold falls in love with Zita (an excellent performance by Carolyn Seymour), marries, and is convinced he is a father - only to have each dream, in turn, shattered. This is certainly a comedy, and a good one at that, but with pathos turned to max, any hilarity available is of a distinctly dark hue."
4,FORTIES-88 top songs an attractive value,"I very much enjoyed 34 of the 88 full cuts available in this 4 CD box set. Born in 1939 this ""only child"" entertained himself with so many of these great songs that were generally performed here by original artists and their original performances. Still, some of the performances have sounded better elsewhere. Nonetheless, a pop music nut like I will enjoy this compilation. The voices sound reasonably attractive, but sometimes the violins and other Instruments don't sound as clean as they should. But perhaps some of the recordings never sounded that great? However, many of them should have had a better HI FI sound. I bought this product from Amazon."
4,Not bad........,"if you're really not into ""huge"" screens for your TV viewing, this might be for you. The VCR is very nice, playback looks great, and so does programs you record. Great picture, sound could be a little better, but for a TV/VCR, it ain't too bad. It has many features. Video games look great on it. My only complaint, it's not multi-standard!"
4,recommended,"A light novel that makes for pleasant summer reading. It has good humor, a nice caper plot, and orignal characters - notably, Mr. Briscoe . It has a hilarious reference to the Amazon.com review page to boot. 4 stars though, not 5, as it tries a bit too hard to make sure you realize something was supposed to be funny (as opposed to, say 'A Confederacy of Dunces' or 'Lucky Jim' i.e., books that just ARE funny). Also, most children of pop culture will spot a couple of jokes from other sources : Raising Arizona (p. 213 ""Simultaneously?""), and Gilligan's Island of all things (p. 89 ""SOS""). Realizing good humor can't be analyzed, it's easy to overlook these minor flaws and say the many postives outweigh a couple of small negatives. This is an accesible -but smart- book you'll enjoy."
2,Hilarity doesn't ensue. And it's insubstantial--not good!,"Apparently other reviewers and cover blurbologists have decided that Monahan's cuteness and occasionally (very occasionally) witty sentences make him THE GREATEST COMIC WRITER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, EVER! But, he's not. Oh, so very not.This novel lacks substance and isn't even funny. It has one good Wasteland reference that made me smile but that's about it. I found the narrative inordinately superficial and trite, and the other reviewer's references to Nabokov leave me founded with dumbness. Have they ever read Nabokov?Perhaps I judge this novel harshly because in the same 24-hour period I also read ERASURE by Percival Everett which is a fantastic version of the erudite comical satircal novel. Everett succeeds on every level, while Monahan just cracks meaningless jokes at the expense of his own characters.William Monahan, I urge you to take your vast wealth of knowledge and write something that matters."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I've enjoyed many of Monahan's NYPress pieces, so I was excited to see he'd written a book. My excitement continued to build as I read the first few chapters, laughing aloud and enjoying the ride. But eventually the book started to unravel, ultimately falling apart. I enjoy odd coincidences and absurdity, but it got to the point where one character could flick a booger out of his nose and it would bounce off six other characters in six other locations before eventually landing back in the original owner's shot glass. And you would've seen it all coming. Also, Monahan obviously doesn't care for any of the characters, so why should the reader? Light House has its moments, and Monahan does show promise, but it's ultimately disappointing."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I've liked Monahan's NYPress work for years, so I was excited to see he'd written a book. The excitement continued in the early going, as I laughed along and enjoyed the ride. But eventually the ride went way off track and the book completely unraveled. I like absurdity and crazy coincidences, but it got to [an absurd] point. Light House had its funny moments throughout, and it's a good first effort, but ultimately it was disappointing."
1,duh,"Where did all the raves come from, I wonder. To me this book is self-indulgent and shallow, full of pointless references that the author must have thought very clever but are merely annoying when they are not facile, even juvenile. If you think that rag targeted at pimply teenagers is hilarious, you'll probably go gaga over this. Otherwise, skip."
2,Literature?,"Why does almost every modern novel today have to be short and funny? Doesn't that say something about our culture? Yes, this book is witty and entertaining, but do people only want to be entertained by writing today? I don't think the ""goal"" of anything should be entertainment, but if you feel you must be entertained, don't desecrate the image of literature. Watch a movie. There are sure enough of them that are so simple you don't have to waste one brain cell on them. Literature, serious fiction, is such a powerful medium of obtaining the Truth - otherwise not communicable. Do yourself a favor and read Dostoevsky, Camus, Hugo, etc. like I normally do. Every once in a while I will read a modern novel just to see if today's novel-writing mind has advanced any. Sadly, on the whole, it hasn't, with a few, (so too few) exceptions. It is frustrating that so much money, time, and paper is wasted on writing like Mr. Monahan's. I have a feeling that he would agree with me."
5,MONAHAN ROCKS THE HOUSE,"Just when you thought modern fiction was going to be one interminable, anemic New Yorker short story, along comes William Monahan with guns blazing! He shoots down the foibles and pretensions of bloodless academics, Miami hit men, and all the rest of us with deadly accuracy. The characters and dialogue are so perfect that the defiantly wild plot is an extra added attraction. His rhythm is STARTLINGLY good ... Suddenly you remember what it's like to read a master of the lost art of writing. As we have, you'll find yourself collecting your own Monahan-isms...(gnome seign?) Whole sentences come back and make you laugh out loud in line at the bank. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK - You're in the hands of a REAL WRITER."
3,Hilarious,"I cannot wholly recommend this book -- it's too esoteric and bizarre, too many over-the-head references for the average reader. I didn't enjoy the writing until about page 40 of the paperback when I read about the aquarium situation. Then I laughed out loud to the point of crying. I read and reread several passages here, just to laugh. I laughed out loud again reading George's drive through the storm description. The strange writing style lends itself to the hilarity of the characters' various fates -- awful fates. I cannot imagine how this novel will be translated to the cinema, but also cannot wait to find out how the big screen will capture this story."
2,Not what I expected,"The dials are hard to read, the batteries were dead, way smaller than it appears on the picture, but kind of bulky at the same time. I had to return it. Looked way better on the picture."
4,The Madonna Stories,"This is a great book that povided me with an award wining for forensics. All the stories are wonderfully emotional and seem to touch you right there. I really suggest this book to anyone who loves Gary Paulsens writtings, it's great!"
2,leadsinger vegas and elvis cartridge,I ordered thinking the bulk of songs would be from Elvis. They were not. Returned the product for a full refund.
2,Shame the cover was wasted on such a weak book...,"I enjoyed Madelynne Ellis's A Gentleman's Wager (black lace) better, the sex was pretty boring and I had to laugh when the heroine called the sex she was having with her boss kinky. The positions themselves are quite common place and almost vanilla compared with other stories I've read. And the plot of this book was really quite ludicrous the villain was not someone to lust after and I really couldn't quite understand what his cult of girls saw in him. He's was one of those mustache twisting villains whose goal never failed to roll your eyes at. About the only good thing about this book was the cover shame it was wasted on such a weak book."
5,More Than a CD,"I love this CD! It has different versions of the song. ( I love the song!) It is also an enhanced CD and has the awesome music video to it, when you put it in your computer!I would recommend it to anyone who likes the song!"
1,Save your money,"The book's indicators are not for the mathmatically challenged, written for Tradestation. That is the majority of the book - BUT, the systems used to win the trading championship were very simple and basic. Not these complex formulas. Looking at the equity curve and his spotlighted trades, it looks like he got lucky, catching the right 2 markets and 3 - 5 trades that made the contest for him.The sections on setting up your screens and computer are obviously very out of date. Nothing special here, you're not missing anything."
3,"It's Not Bad, But...","it's not great either. I thought it was better than the other ""1 star"" reviewers. I believe I enjoyed it better because I had no expectation for this book to really teach me anything spectacular.His work is not too complex, it's just that he presents so many indicators, and then combines them. I thought his use of Kurtosis was interesting and some of his ideas are worth further research if it complements your current work. If you've already devoured your favorite books and are looking to increase your stock in short-term trading ideas, it would be worth a read.I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that his success in theRobbins Championship came from just a few profitably outlying trades.Wait to buy it used for ... less."
3,Local News,Good but local in scope. The information is sound but the two fish - trout and bass - are worth separate books. This book assumes an angler who starts the year on trout and turns to bass when the trout action slumps.
5,Terrific Sea Novel,"""All the Proud Ships"" is one of the best sea novels I've ever read. It's exciting, authentic, and full of action. The heroes, Lt. Ethan Hale and Capt. Patrick Tremayne, are wonderful characterizations. Once you start to read ""All the Proud Ships, you can't put it down. The description of the sailing and fighting of the ships of that era is amazingly accurate, right down to the last detail. A good, well-researched, terrifically entertaining book."
2,Great game for kids,Fun and a much shorter version of the original game that took forever. Even young kids can get into this and learn about purchasing power
4,Great game!,"My sister and I really like to play this game. It's great for two players. The card game is pretty different from the original, but it is quick and a lot of fun!"
3,A Good Basic Spelling Program,"This is a decent spelling program. I have to supplement with other practice outside the book, as there are only a few practice pages per list. My fifth grade son loves to do the extra stuff which includes ""cloud spelling"": use a piece of sketchbook paper, write each word in crayon or colored pencil, put the words in clouds and decorate each cloud, ""crosswords""--use a blank sheet of paper so there are no restrictions on word length, put all words in a crossword puzzle, you can use colored pencils for this too, ""word tree""--design a tree using your words for the trunk (going straight up the page and curving) and branches stemming out from the trunk. Once you do a few ""art"" spelling practices, you will think of many more. We also do traditional sentence writing with spelling words, and see-say-write lists. The book is a good foundation, but does need supplements."
1,A Real Disappointment,"The one eyed soldiers is a lousy film but besides that, this DVD is a hoax. It doesn't have any disc menu, as soon as you put it inside your DVD the movie starts, so you can not select scenes, you can not move it forward or back and of course it has no extras. The color is washed out and it's evident that no work of remastering was ever made, it's like a cheap VHS copied directly into a disc, and besides all that it was quite expensive, I paid $16.77,shiping included, for this. The only consolation is the presence of Luciana Paluzzi but I think it's not enough. After I bought this film, whose DVD cover is only a brown sheet without any pictures just letters, several more of the same title were released with different colors in the cover and one of those even with the original poster, all of them are cheaper than the one I bought, so my recommendation: ""avoid buying this DVD"" at least the one with the brown cover."
2,Take a look at Lezyne first.,"This is an okay pump but Lezyne makes a great pump. Love Lezyne products and found that they are more durable and easier to use. On this product dislike that the end slides on to the stem, it does not screw on securely. We had issues with the o-rings falling out. It was just a pain. I would not recommend unless you are used to using this type of pump and are not looking to put high pressure into your tire. If you are looking for something easy to screw on, high pressure, and smaller to slip into your pack, I would recommend the Lezyne Road Drive."
2,Doesn't fit valve well,"I tried using this frame pump because my rear tire seemed a bit low. The valve fitting was tough to figure out without having read the packaging explaining how to reverse the inner fittings, but I finally got it to work.When I tried attaching the pump to my tire valve, it was too tight - it kept pushing the valve into the tire, and I couldn't get a good seal between the valve and the pump. I eventually gave up and decided to fill my tire at a gas station, but I couldn't get the pump off my valve. It took my a good five minutes of struggling with the pump, trying to force it off the valve before I figured to unscrew the cap of the pump.Unless I'm using this pump incorrectly (which I don't think I am, but would be willing for someone from the manufacturer to correct me), I would not recommend this item."
5,Perfect pump!,"This pump is small, well built and very functional. Great tool for your bike. Get one, you won't regret it!"
4,A small pump,I wanted a small pump for emergency use on my bike. The indoor tests I did seem to show this item will work for my needs. I only need pressures up to 70lbs so I cannot speak to its ability at higher pressures. It seemed to add about 1 lb of air per pump. So it can take awhile to inflate a really low tire.
4,It's really cool and easy to pump,"Even if the pump is small, it doesn't take much effort for you the pump the tire with just about 10 pumps. Interesting design."
1,Sucks,Came with no directions AT ALL. Also did not work airing up my tires. Would not recommend. Wasted money on this now I have to go buy another air pump that actually works.
5,It took me a while,It took me a while to discover how to inflate my bike.You can change the size to inflate your wheel's model. I guess I'm not so smart as my mum always told me.It works great as soon as you know how to use it.
1,Doesn't pump well,"I bought this thinking that it was an equivalent to the full size bike pumps for flat tires. Even though I was ignorant, I think the sellers should have made it clear that this was NOT to be used for fixing general flats. I asked some bike shop owners and, for those of you who are thinking of buying this, please note that it's only for emergencies where it needs a tiny bit more air to make it until you can get to a proper bike pump.Even when I tried to use it in the conditions that it was apparently made for, it barely pumped in any air at all. I lost more air than I could get into the tire.The only reason I couldn't return it was that I waited too long to use it and I had passed the final return date."
4,Air pump,I bought this in case I have an issue on the road and need to air up the tire to get home. Simple enough to use and fits well on the bottle cage.
4,Small pump for small tires & small hands,"If you have never seen how to switch a dual presta & schrader type pump then the cryptic directions are useless and bring it to a bike shop to show you how to set it up for schrader valve stems. The small design is nice, but realize if you have a larger tire on a crossover or mountain bike you will be pumping for a while, but that's better than walking back. It's 1/4 the size and weight of my top tube mounted Zefal pump. If you have large hands like me be careful as the pumping action on a large tire is easy and you tend to go fast and can pinch yourself during the monotonous pumping."
1,"Got it for Mountain Bike, Doesn't Seem to Work At All on Schrader tubes","I can't seem to pump the tire at all. After deflating it all the way with my non-portable pump, I just couldn't get the pump on the valve. I knew it was set up for Schrader valves, because if I took the little plastic out and put it directly on the tire it would start draining the tire, but I couldn't manage to actually lock harness onto valve for pumping. Even after getting it on the valve slight it was really hard to get off. I hear this works fine on road bikes, but on my mountain bike it does not."
1,Make sure it fits!,"I purchased this pump for a mountain bike with a standard stem. When I tried using it I was disappointed when it was too small for my bicycle! Fortunately it was only $10, it's really not worth the hassle of trying to return it!"
2,Takes way too many pumps,"I ended up returning this item because I felt like I had to pump and pump and pump and hardly made any progress. It did have a very handy attachment for my bike, which was easy to install."
3,Fair but needs work,"The directions on it hardly helps at all, I was left in the dark. I couldn't make anything out of that simple picture on it. I was thinking I needed to buy attachments for it. It was only AFTER I read the reviews here that I found out how to fix the head on the pump to my needs. I was ready to return it until then.Now that I'm able to change the head it works perfectly. I need to pump a lot more then my old pump but it meets my needs. As a pump I have no issues with it. But the directions...or rather lack of directions...need alot of improving"
3,It's ok,"Takes a VERY long time to get a flat tire going again. I also don't like the so-called ""mounting bracket"". Not really what it is. WOuld have been nice to have something you can also use without screws. I don't have any on my bike."
3,"Lightweight, ok-not great",Very light and easy to frame mount. Valve adaptor setup was confusing as instructions are quite limited. Takes a lot of pumping to fill a 700 tire and difficult to get up to pressure.
3,Nothing great,"Well, it works and didn't cost much. It fell off for no good reason except the flimsey rubber strap holding it just let go. Luckily, I happened to see it fall and retrieved it, I'll tie it on now."
1,Thought this was quality....WRONG,"What a nightmare. After an hour pumping, going on line for help and pumping more I give up. There are some instructions on the package and more online, but they don't help since it just doesn't work well on schrader valves. Maybe on the french the other valve setup would work. Managed to get the bike tires half full at best. Totally frustrating!"
1,Not Impressed,"Took me awhile to figure out how the set up for the Schraeder valves on my bike.Once I did I discovered that it still was a pain to use.Its difficult to get the pump to seal so you can inflate. I don't have a problem deflating the tire while using this pump.When I do get it hooked up properly and inflated, once finished the pump latches onto the valve and nothing short of unscrewing the cap and taking the pump parts off individually will release its grip.Sorry Topeak, not a fan."
5,Handy pump.,I ride in Az and one never knows what will happen to a tire. This is so light and handy to carry and I feel secure knowing I have a great pump to fix me up.
4,works pretty good,"works pretty good for how small it is. Comes with both types of valves, so that's good. I don't own a floor pump, so it's adequate... but I think I still need a floor pump. good secondary pump."
4,"Works well with both Schrader, and Presta valves.","This pump works well with both types of valves. Kind of tricky to switch from one type to the other but it does work.Sincerely,Ira Carmel"
5,just what i needed!,Works great for a small pump. The bracket attachment is perfect placement tucked away behind the water bottle cage! Don't expect high volume though!
5,A must have for small wheels,This pump would get 5 stars stars from me as a simple frame-mounted emergency pump; but I would give it more for the aggravation it has saved me in filling my kids' bike tires as well as those on my stroller and bike trailer.
1,not worth,"of course, should have checked but the bike I have has a different tip. Regardless, the small size is lucrative but you cannot apply sufficient power to pump up to 35 (I found an adapter). get the biggest you can still carry."
1,Not as described,The description states it is compatible with presta/schrader valves. It actually doesn't fit schrader valves at all which makes this item completely useless to me. If I had tires with presta valves to test this on I would probably give it higher stars if it even worked.
1,Trash (No Good) ** Revised**,"I can't even figure out where to begin. No instructions..... Once I figured out which combination of valve inserts to use to air up both Presta and Schrader valves... it simply would not go down far enough on the valve stem to air up the tire. With the Presta combo... before I could get the pump on the stem good... it let all of the air out of the tire. With the Schrader combo... I couldn't even get it down far enough to do anything!!! Garbage!!!**Revision**Okay... after watching numerous online videos describing how to use this pump, I finally got it to work with the Schrader valve set-up. It takes alot of pumping to get from 0 psi. to 100 psi. but it does work. I do like how lite it is and how it mounts under the water bottle holder. I think I will be able to use this on the road when I have nothing else. Otherwise I will be using my air compressor at home."
1,Save yourself the trouble...,"I wanted to try something new so I decided on this hand pump - worst mistake ever. I've had two foot pumps break so I thought this would be better. First of all, the instructions are so minimal I had to follow other reviewer's hints. It seems like putting air in a bike tire would be simple - its not. Simply put, 5-10 mins to figure out it doesn't come ready to use(-1). After pumping air with 15 strokes, I pinched my skin in the pump(-1). The final straw was the fit was so tight it wouldn't release from the valve. I tried my best to slowly remove it. It was so tight it caused my valve to separate from the tubing. I just heard a deflating tire. (-1). Now I have to throw this junk away, invest in another pump PLUS replace my tire/tubing. Thanks Topeak for a horrible product."
1,Terrible and a Hassle,I have a shimano 21 speed bike and this barely fits my bike!!! It was hassle that I put it in ALL the way and it was a HASSLE taking it out! I'm going to return this because it barely fits and have possibly made a tear in my valve tube...I wouldn't recommend this for shimano 21 speed bikes.
5,Tiny but powerful!,Fits on the bike so when you get a low tire -- poof and you are back up and running. SO far it's working well. I love the small size!
5,Great Pump,"Attractive aluminum body, feels sturdy in the hand, and I had no problem attaching it to my Schrader valves and pumping to 50 PSI. Gets a bit warm to the touch after use, but nothing unbearable. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty good little pump,"It takes a few tries to get it right, but after breaking two presta stems I finally feel like I have figured it out. I'm a complete novice that is learning about my bike as I go, which may be why I broke a couple of stems. Words of advice: be extra careful when removing from presta stem, the rubber from the pump might grab a part of the stem and break it!"
3,"Small, Light, and a LOT of Work","This is really a ""get you home"" pump, and is just too much work to inflate a tire to full pressure. A better pump in this size would have a larger diameter, and be a two-stage pump. 80 psi is about it for this guy. Enough to get you home - even 15-20 miles, but not really good for full tire inflation. Buy a floor pump for that. I've had this one about 4 yrs now.These pumps are often mounted along side the frame, and in that position, they are parachutes. Above 15 mph you can start to feel the drag. In heavy winds they're just unbearable. Mount them slung under your saddle bag with some 1/8th inch bungee chord.After some remarks on a review of a ToPeak saddle several year ago, I am thrilled to see that my new expandable ToPeak bag has an elastic strap under the back of the bag precisely for that purpose. Always there, out of the way, and helps hold the saddle bag up too."
2,How the hell does it work???,"The instructions are horrible and I know it MUST work for my tires, but I'll be damned if I can find anything that explains how to use it. Online blogs give some direction, but I'm a visual person and can't find any photos. The instructions that come with it are worse than useless. I would probably rate it higher, but I have to figure out how the hell to use it first..."
1,If I could give this zero I would,"Useless. Will not properly fit on valve, even after changing it around to work with my type of valves. Buy at your own risk."
5,Lightweight & very useful,"I've owned this product since Aug 2010, and it's been attached to my bike ever since. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I actually got to use it 'for real'. I was a few miles from my home when I noticed my back tire was going flat. I changed the tube out on the side of the road, and used this little jewel to air up the replacement. It takes a little while to air up the tire, but wasn't bad. It's better than the alternative. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to carry an air pump while on the road. The build is sturdy, and it's very light."
4,Great pump for me,"I was able to inflate my two children bike tires with no effort, for the heck of it I tried it on my car tires for a couple of PSIs only it can inflate those high pressure bike tires) and to my surprise it did get them to the right PSI it took some pumping but the pump handled it. The size and convenience of tucking it anywhere in the car or in a backpack can't be beat."
4,"Outstanding for a small, convenient pump","This pump is amazingly easy to mount to a bike with braze-ons, and convenient to use. Its usefulness is mostly restricted to small, incremental tire inflation. If you try to pump a tire up from zero with this thing, you have a lot of work ahead of you. However, that is what floor pumps are for. A road pump like this is useful for dealing with a quick top-off of tire pressure, and as long as you use it for that, it will give good service."
3,Hope I never actually need it.,I have this for emergencies. It is hard to use and I am not always sure it is connected properly. It was tedious to figure out how to convert it to my style tire but not impossible.
3,Not my first choice,"It works, don't get me wrong, but it's just not very user friendly. It's a bit awkward to use at different angles and can easily put too much pressure on the tire stem--it actually ripped one of my tubes. I kept it because it's useful in a pinch, and because I was being too careless with it when I put a hole in my tube. But I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it."
2,Maybe better for presta,"Takes a lot of effort and even a fair bit of strength to pump up a Schrader valve bike tire with this. I'm an adult male of above-average strength (former competitive powerlifter) and I found it a bit of a struggle to inflate a tire fully. Also, the instructions for changing over the valve (or I should say lack thereof) are terrible. Go here (but you shouldn't have to go online, and the set-up is by no means intuitive): [...]"
1,couldn't get it on tire,There was no way that I was able to get this pump onto my tire to pump it. Not much instructions. I had to go out and buy another pump.
2,added stress,"I have had this product for several months now and had to use it twice in circumstaces where I realy needed it. The problem seems to be the valve in the head of the pump ( part that attaches to the valve ) sticks. this results in either very slow intake of air back in to the pump ( 2-3 secs. ) or sucking the air back out of the tire that you just pumped in. I will give the manufacturer a chance to make good, however if you are going to buy this pump you should know that even if it works as designed it will take aprox. 200 pumps to inflate past the possibility of a pinch flat"
4,Good pump,"Let's start from the not so good: this is small and the amount of air you will pump in every movement is small. If you want to inflate your tire to 90PSI, it is going to take a while... But, this is the price you pay for getting such a small pump. Actually, I had a schwin before and it could not pump above 50PSI or something like that. This one will pump in as much air as your arm can bear. If you think you will be too tired after 100 pumps you better buy a CO2 cartridge and pump. In any case, this attachs to my water bottler attachment today and is almost invisible because of the size and location. It is also extremelly light so it does not weight to light roadie."
4,Good repair/on the road bike pump,I give this pump a five star for performance. It helped me get back on the road after coming back from school. thou I gave this product a 3 lack if instructions on how to covert into the shradder valve.
5,"Big power, small package",Talk about a powerful little guy. This pump handles jobs way bigger than itself. I use it in tandum with a digital pressure reader because this little guy doesn't have a pressure reader. I would much rather have this compact super pump than a bigger one with a bunch of bells and whistles.
2,On Your Own,"This is probably a pretty good pump, if you can figure out how to work it. As other reviewers have noted, the instructions are non-existent. Without a video from YouTube, I could never have figured out how to fix it for the Schrader tip. However, that is not the worst part. When I tried to air up my bike tire for the first time, the tip fit so tightly that I completely tore out the tip on the inner tube when I tried to remove the pump! Can you believe that? Now, I have to buy a new tube and get the tire fixed. Unbelievable. The worst part is that I found a similar pump (Mammoth) at Marshall's today for $4.00, and it will do the job just as well. I cannot recommend this until the company provides some adequate instructions on operating the pump. I'll bet this is not the first time this has happened to someone. Look elsewhere, unless you are positively sure that this is the pump you want."
5,Nice little pump,"Works well for the money, just try to make sure the valve is inserted properly and pump some iron before you use the product. Needs a lot of pumping to fill up a tire due to it's size."
2,Not so easy to use,"As one reviewer said that the piston rod is easly fell off by gentle touch. However, my main complain is it is not very easy to use for pumping air on the Schrader valve on my Giant bike. I have push the pump head to the valve with one hand to ensure there is no air leakage, while pumping on the other. I don't recommend this pump for people."
2,I'd buy a different one,"Pros:1. It's cheap,2. It's lightweight.3. It's not flimsy. The construction seems solid.Cons:1. Very poor product design2. There are no directions on how to use it. Ya might think, it's a pump. How hard can it be. But it's not designed to work out of the packaging, and there are no instructions on how to get it ready to use. Fortunately, there were people who explained it in their reviews, and I managed to figure it out through them.3. It's difficult to get a good seal when pumping4. It takes a LOT of energy to pump a tire. I worked up an insane sweat pumping 2 flat tires.5. After pumping, it was so difficult to remove the pump from the tire valve, I thought I was going to tear the valve right off (which according to some reviews, some people have.)"
5,Bike pump review,"I've had this pump for about a year, or perhaps more relevantly, ~10 flats, now. This has been a very dependable part of my biking kit. After fixing a flat, it shouldn't take more than 2 minutes of pumping to get a tube reflated to a decent (~80) psi. Comes with equipment to attach it to your bike, but recently I've been keeping it in my backpack since I sometimes take different bikes.I haven't had to try to reinflate a schrader valve with this yet, but it looks like a simple procedure. The front unscrews, and you switch the valve around.And if you're using this pump as your primary pump, you're doing it wrong (or really stingy). This doesn't have a gauge, and you won't be able to get into the 100+psi range easily."
5,"small, lightweight, efficient","Can recommend this pump. It is very lightweight, small. Very good emergency pump to take with your bike anywhere. Pump operates smoothly and there is very very little air leak. Pump is surprisingly efficient. Nonetheless, with the size it takes many strokes to fill the tire -- a price one has to pay for the small size. Well worth it in my view."
4,"So far, so good","I've only had it about a month, but so far it has been great, with only one minor annoyance.It is light, small, and effective. I would like it more if the handle could pivot 90 degrees to make it easier to push, but it hasn't been a problem the way it is. I'm quite happy with what I got for the money.The only real problem is that the rubber stopper (which you see hanging open in the picture) will NOT stay in place. It always falls out and hangs just like in the picture. Given that it won't stay in place at all, I don't think it serves any purpose. The amount of rubber on the stopper/plug/whatever-you-call-it that is in contact with the rubber around the valve is very little, so it's no wonder it won't stay in place. I was able to spot the problem right after buying it, so I'm baffled as to why the product designers missed (or chose not to fix) something so obvious.In the end, I'd recommend it anyway."
5,It just works. Good one.,"Nice small pump sitting on my bike :)It is simply works.I like that feature, when pump output is closed and protected agains dust."
1,Does not work!!!,I tried this product on several bikes and it did not work! The directions used vague pictures and while it showed a standard valve stem there is no way to get it to fit! Shameful selling a special purpose bike pump as standard equipment.
2,Couldn't get it to work,"threw it out and decided to get a floor pump. Never could get it to impart air to my schrader type valve. The bracket can only be connected to the frame if the frame is pre-drilled and -tapped, and the pump is kept in the bracket by a rubber band that would have broke in a month.This was the first frame pump I'd bought so I can't compare, but it certainly wasn't what I expected.I give it two stars instead of one, figuring maybe I wasn't doing something right, but if so then I'd have to say operation was definitely *non-intuitive*"
1,the worst bike pump ever,looks good on the picture and in real but when i got it found out the cap does not seal the tire vent properly that is simply piece of crap i trow it away waste of my money !!!!!!!!!!!
1,wrong product? Or mislabeled product?,"All I have to say is that when a pump says it pumps bike tires, then it should probably pump bike tires. I have a normal bicycle, and this pump won't pump up the tires. Also, the little instruction picture does NOT match what the pump's mechanical pieces actually look like, so its pretty hard to decipher exactly how this thing was meant to work on different tire types. Well, don't buy. Buy a different pump instead, this one is junk..."
5,Great Pump. Well Worth the Price,"This is a great pump. It fills tires to high pressure easily, for Schrader or Presta valves. There is a plastic piece that you remove and invert to switch a from Schrader to Presta fitting. My only concern is that this piece doesn't seem overly sturdy. But it is working fine so far, and I haven't seen anyone complain about problems with it in reviews... Thsi is one of my best purchases for my bike."
5,Great Little On-Frame Bike Pump,"This is a great pump. It fits perfectly on the frame of a bike. It is pretty small, so it will take a bit of time to fill a completely empty tube, but that's not what frame pumps are designed to do. This pump is definitely worth getting. It's great for adding the little bit of air that comes out of the tires with frequent cycling."
4,"Great pump, so-so bracket","This is a very sleek little pump that fits nicely on my women's road bike with limited space.The pump itself works well without too much effort to replace the tubes (although I have noticed the pump gets pretty warm). I do occasionally have difficulty getting a good seal with my presta valve tubes.I am less enthused with the flimsy plastic bracket. I have not had it break but I am worried the plastic seems to bend quite a bit - however it does come with a rubber band to hold the pump in place even if the bracket gives.Bottom line: I would like a gauge, but the pump works very well with little trouble and very little added weight - so yes, I would recommend it."
3,"Works in a pinch, needs muscle.","Meh.It's okay. Works great for emergencies and wider tires. Sure, specs say up to 160 psi, but who are we fooling here? After 80 psi you better be really strong. My biggest problem with this is the higher psi you approach it gets awkward/difficult to operate. In an emergency, on a road bike, it will get your tire inflated enough to ride to a floor pump, but don't rely on it as a primary pump or even to 'top off' your pressure.I'm glad mine got stolen. It gave me the ""opportunity"" to purchase a Lezyne micro floor pump, which is 3x more expensive, but 3x more worth it, and 3x more likely to get stolen. D'oh."
4,First impressions,"This is a very small, lightweight pump for trail-side emergencies only. It shouldn't be your only pump, by any means.Due to the smallness, there are a few features that are missing. First, the handle doesn't pivot to use as a grip. Another thing that may be annoying is that the little rubber cover for the valve fits well when configured for the Presta valve, but has a tendency to fall open when changed to Schrader valve configuration. I added a little rubber band to keep things together for now.It mounts well under the water bottle cage, and is well-distanced from the pedals. Inserting the pump into its holder is a very tight fit - in very cold weather, I'd worry about it becoming brittle and cracking, but it will hold the pump without affixing the rubber 0-ring-type strap that is provided.These are only my first impressions. I have not had the chance to inflate a tire from flat yet. I will be back to re-evaluate once I've had some field testing."
2,"Useful for small jobs, damaged two of my tubes","I was pretty satisfied with this pump.Then it broke the valve off two of my tubes.This is a great little pump for taking with you for the occasional small pump-up on the road. However, BE VERY CAREFUL to hold the valve end still. In using it for pumping up tires most of the way, I had two unfortunate situations that the movement back and forth of the pump actually sliced the valve off my tube, rendering them useless (with a big ol' hole in them)."
3,Compact but difficult to connect and slow...,"Started commuting by bike and I needed a pump I could carry everywhere for the emergency thorn/nail. This pump is nice and compact and very well built. The valve system took a bit of figuring out but it does work for both the schrader and high pressure valve and its easy to switch between the two once you know how. My only other issues are it takes a bit of work to connect to the valve and is slow to pump, as is expected with such a small pump. That being said, I still bring it everywhere with me..."
1,I hate this pump - Very hard to pull from the valve after pumping,"I think that the only good thing that this pump has going on is size and portability. Otherwise, it's very cumbersome to use:- You have to do a bit of guesswork to ""convert"" the pump to your type of valve. As it came from factory, it wasn't compatible with mine, so I had to adjust it. It wasn't too complicated but it takes a bit of guesswork, since it's only explained with a few drawings on the carton.- It takes a lot of handwork to pump. A LOT!- It grips the valve and it's VERY hard to take out. When pumping, it's great that it attaches to the valve with such force. However, when it comes the time to take it out, you have to pull really hard. One time, I was trying to take it out and injured myself. Today, I used it again and when I was trying to take it out, it pulled the whole valve out of the tire.Throwing this thing on the garbage."
1,Terrible for schrader valves.,"Difficult to put on a schrader valve, and so difficult to get off it ripped the valve stems off of two tubes."
4,The picture is correct.,That little rubber stopper never stays closed and will eventually rip off when it snags on something trail side. That's the only down side. A friend had to borrow it for some high pressure tires and I told him it probably wont get up to 70 p.s.i. and I'll tell you if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed it. It did take a while though.
3,Price is right,It fits too tight on the valve but once it's on it pumps easily. Getting it off takes a lot of force and I'm sure I'll rip the tube eventually. Looks like I need to get a better one for home use.
5,Funny as always,"Pat McManus is always a great read. If you like hunting, fishing, picking ""huckleberries"", kids adventures or anything outdoors related you will love this book. I can't read it in bed because I keep my wife awake laughing."
5,Proem - Socially Inept,"Simple beauty, simply done well. Proem's SOCIALLY INEPT starts off with the haunting ""I Don't Know How to Tell,"" merging crispy beats over a melody that grows in clarity. ""Invisible for All"" has a iciness that chills even as the digital percussion skitters its way through. The initial harshness of ""Pinching Point"" gives way to funky electronics, and ""Place Gun to Head"" has a stately, eerie grace. The processed vocals on ""When Frailty Fails"" add a melancholy texture, and ""Da.Vironment"" accelerates the tempo somewhat. ""Carpark Kittens"" sets the beats a-thumpin' and ends on a strangely psychotic note, while ""Deep Like an Airplane Failure"" introduces a gentle guitar line to accompany the clicking beneath. And the title track, closing out the album, veers into symphonic grandeur."
3,Buenas letras y cantante..... la mezcla ..UUUMMMMMM,"Las letras de las canciones de Felipe Pirela siempre me han gustado desde muy chico. A través de mis padres aprendí a disfrutar de las mismas, sin embargo, luego de varios de no escucharlas, me sonó muy ""chillón"" todo el fondo musical.Puedo escuchar 2-3 piezas y disfrutarlas, pero luego de eso, tengo que cambiar de CD.Es una buena pieza para coleccionistas o para escuchar de tiempo en tiempo"
3,Health plan,This book provides very useful information. It is easy to understand and covers every facet of a healthy lifestyle.
1,More of the same,"After waiting for so long for ""the real Mayo Clinic"" diet, even ordered the book before it was released, I was very disappointed by its rudimentary same simplistic approach to dieting. Also it lacks sample menus and its so simple on so many levels. Mayo Clinic played it safe and wrote an approach of healthy eating, and you would have to have come from a different planet not to know! I will donate mine to the Port Austin library! They need books!"
3,LFG Review,"Haven't had a chance to thoroughly review the book, but it appears to be all that I had expected."
5,Memory Lane!,Watching these dvd's is like a delightful trip down memory lane. The Pink Panther/Inspector Clouseau cartoons are hilarious! Just as good as you remember them!
3,Good Pink Panther but VERY Dissappointed,"that this long awaited collection didn't include ""The Inspector"" or ""The Ant & The Ardvark"" cartoons. The Inspector is one of my all time favorites! I still may buy this collection but am most certainly dissappointed that MGM left out 2 classics that certainly should have been included. Hopefully someone will release a complete set of the Inspector and Ant & The Ardvark cartoons sometime in the near future."
3,"Cartoons, please","Agree with most reviews here about the content. Too bad some of the toons do not feature the original theatrical tracks.As to the extras....the list looks substantial, but most of it is just fluff. The ""animated credit sequences"" from the Sellers films are presented 1.85:1 and slightly squeezed! Why? If you want to see these the way they were meant to be seen, you'll have to buy the movies! The sequences are in no way otherwise different from those presented in the actual films."
2,No Inspector or Aardvark,"While I'm glad to have all the Pink Panther shorts in one place, how difficult could it have been to put the Inspector and Aardvark cartoons in there as well?"
1,Is Amazon being misleading?,"If, as customer reviews state, this 5 DVD box does not include the wonderful ""Inspector"" cartoons - why does the Amazon editorial at the head of the page declare ""Episodes of this series feature three theatrical cartoons, two with the Pink Panther, and one featuring the Inspector, a cartoon version of the accident-prone, bumbling French detective, Inspector Clouseau, played in movies by Peter Sellers. The Inspector is often assisted by a Spanish gendarme, Sergeant Deux-Deux, and together they fallibly battle villains of all shapes and sizes in various parts of the world, always on the orders of the long-suffering Surete Commissioner""?I am mystified, but rather believe the customer reviews which say that the box does not contains these great additional cartoons. Why the confusion, Amazon? This is seriously misleading!"
3,"I enjoy it, but . . .","I would enjoy it more if ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" cartoons were included. I don't mind that the ""Misterjaw,"" ""Texas Toads,"" and ""The Inspector"" cartoons aren't here. However, the producers of this boxed set missed out by not including ""The Ant and the Aardvark.""I was surprised that I remembered so many of these cartoons. I had forgotten several of them. I remember when the ""Pink Panther"" show was only thirty minutes long. The show ran two ""Pink Panther"" cartoons with one by ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" in between. The Pink Panther was a major part of my childhood on Saturday mornings. Sometimes, it's fun to be reminded of those days. I hope ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" will soon join ""The Pink Panther"" on DVD."
5,Pink Panther cartoons,"Great buy! I love the pink panther cartoons. They did not include the Ant and the Aardvark series though. Apart from that, its a good collection to own."
1,You won't laugh once.......Pitiful,"I love classic animation, but truth be told, Friz Freleng had lost his comic gifts when he got into the making of these excrutiatingly painfully unfunny, boring cartoons, which dragged on for years,They're being drudged up now to ""synergize"" with the new Steve Martin remake of Peter Sellers' PINK PANTHER movie, the release of which, has been postponed enough times to indicate a disaster.Whatever happens with the movie, just let these cheap-o Panther cartoons rest in peace. They're really terrible, and it is typical of the latest incarnation of MGM or Sony or whoever they are, to try to make gold out of dross.YUK!"
2,Bad Decision,"This person is just trying to relive my memories from the past. I have ordered cartoons featuing the Loony Toons, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Flintstones, etc. But this Pink Panther collection is BORRRRING!"
4,Ant & The Ardvark,"I love the Pink Panther, but what about the ""Ant And The Ardvark"" Cartoons are they included in this set? I would buy the set in a heartbeat if they were. Thanks."
4,"Ken from Orange, CA","This is the entire Pink Panther collection on one set of DVD's. A timeless cartoon that my 5 year old daughter absolutely loves, and much better than the stuff they pass for cartoons today (except for PBS Kids). Would have given it a 5 if it included the Ant and Anteater cartoons as well as the Inspector ones. Picture quality appears very good for such an old cartoon too."
3,Two #2's,"I searched for this collection for many years. At one time, I placed bids at an auction for a simular product. I was very pleased when I found this collection, yet, displeased when I discovered TWO #2's in the set and no disc #1 (the best)."
5,It is what it is,"If you like the Feline, you must have this. Tons of classic visual jokes in a minimalist setting, nothing is in focus just the fun. Some complained about the packagin, I think it is OK (since I usually make a safety copy of my DVDs and keep the original in a safe place.) However it is a pity that the stories of the little French detective (Clouseau?) are not included, in the TV version they support well the Panther's epizodes. In one word: this DVD collection is GREAT!!"
2,Someone Better Take Some Caffeine Pills for This One!,"This book is so boring- ZZZZZZZ. It was very hard for me to finish. If you are going to buy a book, buy one that Mary Higgins Clark has written, not EDITED. Because this one is SLOW."
3,What a great way to find new authors to read!,"This is the second book of its type that I have purchased that is presented by Mary Higgens Clark. I think she has made a great choice in the selection of authors. Nancy Pickard makes a second appearance, and since I read the first book I have now purchased all of her books. The stories are great, and give you an insight into the style of the other authors. When Mary Higgens Clark does not have anything out at the moment it is a great way to find other authors BEFORE you buy their books."
3,Decent Vacation read!,"I took this book on vacation and it was good for light reading around the pool. Two of the ten stories were rather boring, but the rest were entertaining and at least three (All You Need Is Love by Sarah Shankman; Afraid of the Dark by Nancy Packard; Sibling Rivalry by Brendan DuBois) were VERY good. Well, I felt I got [my money's] worth of entertainment out of it anyway."
2,"One or two good ones, but .......","There were a couple of good stories here, and I even found one author to follow up on, so I guess it was worth the two bits I paid for the book and the few evenings of bedtime and bathroom reading spent on it. But most were middlin' at best and several were almost painful to read.Part of the boredom factor is that only about half are actually mysteries or investigations, the rest simply involving crime in some form.Just FYI, although others have pointed this out, none of the stories is actually by Mary Higgins Clark, if that's what you are looking for.Buy it cheap and recycle it, or just borrow it."
1,boring,this was one of the worst books i have read. i didn't even finish it. i guess if you like short stories that are not even written by mary higgins clark then read it. very dissapointing.
3,Took me awhile to figure it out but once I did it's useful!,"It took me awhile to figure out which way the adjustable adaptors go and which was the one that fit my bike's tires... but once I did, it works great! the adaptors twist off (there are 2 random pieces that reverse) and it was quite confusing as one of the reviews mentioned. Other than that, it's small, portable, and easy to pump a bike's tires!"
2,Don't be fooled by cheap pumps,"Don't be fooled by cheap pumps. This pump will do the trick but you will be exhausted by the time you pump a new tube up. Don't go cheap on hand pumps, spend $40-$50 bucks for quality"
5,Growing and Laughing with Enda,"Belly Laughter for Relationships should burst on the self-help scene like a bombshell! This is a book that is practical, well-written, and inimitable in its effect on the reader.For those in despair, there is hope; for those in need of practical direction, there is a clear path to follow; for those who want to enhance a good relationship, there are sparks to engerize both partners.Belly Laughter for Relationships is a must-have for those not content with the mediocre in any relationship. By following the suggestions that are given with humor and sensitivity, any person can initiate, repair, or enhance relationships. Belly Laughter for Relationships is instructive, enjoyable to read--a worthy addition to any library.After reading and enjoying Belly Laughter for Relationships, I highly and without reservation recommend it as a potential life-changer--for you and those you love."
1,out of stock,"I was never able to purchase this book. After two weeks of not receiving my book, I find out it had not been in stock. That would have been nice to know ahead of time!"
3,Keep pot holder handy,This is an OK pot for the money. But make sure you lift the pot with pot holders; the handles get hot.
2,Handle not soldered on,"This pot looks ok, although the base is not as thick as I wanted. The handles are soldered on, not screwed. The handle on the lid was only attached at one end. The other was ""floating."" There was no way to attach it DIY, so I had to return it."
3,Decent if you have the extra $ laying around,"This single is ok, not that bad. The interview is kinda boring, and it's hard to understand what they're saying in some parts. But I can't give it less than 3 stars cause it's *N Sync!"
1,MY GOD...,"Why? This is a completely useless record, but somehow timeless, haha. I'm amazed this even is up for sale at this website. Who the hell recorded these retarded versions? The drumplayer must be a one-armed 5 year old and the dude singing must have this really bad split personality......or is he a Kurt-reborn..."
1,MUST READ THIS,This is a horrible cd. NOT recommended to ANYONE!!!! The person in charge of this production should be ashamed...this is a discrace to nirvana fans everywhere!
1,no words to describe,the horror! who ever put this idea into motion needs to be punched in the neck.
4,"I've only used it once, but liked what I saw.","I wasn't blown away by the results, but I'm guessing with repeated the use of this product would shine through. It certainly helped loosen up some stuck on grime. I'm thinking with repeated use that grime either wouldn't stick to begin with or would simply rinse off. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and am looking forward to the rainy season being over so I can continue to use it!"
5,Inspiring Patterns,"Love to look at the pictures, gives me lots of inspiration to get things done. Bought it for one particular pattern, but turned out I love a lot of the others too."
3,"Not the only book to have, but helpful","I agree with the last reviewer but I have to say it's most helpful to have the Chiltons manual as well as the Haynes and especially the Jeep Factory Service Manual. None of these alone has had everything I needed in it and I've found it helpful to look in each of them to see which has the best write up for whatever I was working on. Heck, it's only $16 anyway."
3,Good Manual; poor photos,"Very complete. Has wiring diagrams for each year, both engine & chassis. Bring your reading glasses; some illustrations are quite small & a number of photos are poor."
3,Blah Blah Aparthied,"I do not recommend this book. There is some information that is useful, but not much. Kind of boring really as one would expect"
1,Poor fit for Glock Model 30 Mags!,"This item was described as a perfect fit for Glock Model 30 magazines. The Model 30 mags do fit very well inside the holder but the end flap that secures the magazine is 1.5"" too long to allow the shared Velcro patch to secure the unit to your belt and secure the end flap. Rather than return the item, I will have to cut off 1.5"" of the end flap and sew my own Velcro onto the flap in order to make it work with a Model 30 mag. (Longer mags for other Glock models may fit perfectly right out of the box.) The seller and manufacturer should revise their product description!"
1,Misleading Listing,"I'm not sure how this product works, the truth is I never used it. From the information provided in the listing by the seller, the item seemed to be the full version of Crystal Reports software. Nowhere in the listing was their any mention of training or educational product. Yet, when we received the item, we were surprised to find it only an instructional CD-ROM about how to use Crystal Reports 9.Very misleading and makes me very unhappy to have wasted the time trying to use Amazon to make the purchase. I would completely trust Amazon if the product had been sold directly by them. Now however, I will be slow to trust any individual seller on Amazon."
3,After all we have it in DVD !,"This show is a must to have, no matter season 12 is not as good as the previous ones. One bad thing is that there are no subtitles in portuguese or spanish, how could Paramount miss that? From season 8 to 12 Paramount simply forgot or ignored that there are H5O funs all around the world. I hope Paramount fix that as soon as possible."
5,THis is the sad end to Five0,This is the sad end to one great TV show. Jack Lord is trying to make it work with the new people.And can only do so much. I am happy that I will now have them all.And can watch them as I wish.This was when TV was great and had great shows on. Not like the trash that is on now!I will pick this up the day it comes out.It will not be long until I don't need cable at all.(( Update). I caned the Cable TV...Cut about $70.00 off my bill. Just got the High Speed Net with them now. They just did a Up-Grade on it.. Now going up to 50.So that is fine with me...Be well all.
1,Really sad ending to a great series,"This season is horrible . Bad writing, gasty bad acting and direction. Five-0 ran out of gas around season 8 but it limped a long because the ratings were decent ratings (more a testament how bad late 1970's tv was . Seasons 9 and 10 was so so at best , seasons 11 and 12 are a embarrassment. Were I live in So Cal I recently re watched last two gasty bad seasons of Five-0 on the ota oldies tv station kdoc channel 56.1 late nite . Unless you absolutely need a complete series or won the lotto and have money to burn on mystery science theater bad tv I would advise you spend you hard earned cash on other high quality season sets. Its really really bad especially any episode with Kimo and Truck . Spend your $$$$ elsewhere you probably watch this season once and smash it for be a sucker and buying it . I really love seasons 1 - 8. Seasons 9-12 there are loads of stinker episodes with plot wholes, continuity errors, bad scripts, acting and direct . Its ssd it so bad."
5,"Green light, Red light!!",I've been playing this game since I was a little girl. My grandma introduced my sister and I to the game and now we play it with my sister's family. This game has green lights where you can collect points (or speeds for your car) until someone throws a Red light at you and you can't collect anymore until you get a green to go!! It's a fun game and can get very competitive!
4,excellent purchase,"i played this game 30 years ago, but did not have the directions. all 5 of my kids love this game, ages 3-12. we make them total their own points. my 5 year old picked it up quite quickly and now i see my 7 and 5 year old playing by themselves. they should have made a cooler card holder but other that that this game rocks."
4,Mille Bornes reborn!,I grew up playing this game and some friends told us where they bought it online so now we have our own set. Our children LOVE playing. They love cars and it's a good math help. Great all around.
3,great for the family,This game is fun for those who know how to play. For those who do not know it takes a littie bit of practice before you are able to really compete. You must be a good teacher in order to teach this game well.
1,Game is beyond me!,Maybe if you grew up playing this game it would be fun but I didn't. I was looking for a new card game. I couldn't figure it out. Maybe I'm stupid but I found the instructions confusing. I never found anyone to help me with the game so I sold it at a garage sale. Don't hold my review against the manufacturer...just consider who wrote the review. Happy card playing!
5,Great family fun!,"I played this game with my family as a child. I was amazed this game is still styled the same. It's the perfect card game to play with my husband and children now. It's fun and at the same time teaches logical thinking, strategy and teamwork. I definitely recommend this game to people of all ages. Our youngest is 8 years old and she figured it out quickly to where it's still enjoyable for the adults in the game."
2,Nothing,"Mille Bornes is a fun game. Great for kids and adults. But there's absolutely nothing special about this special ""collectors edition"". You're paying $15 for a deck of cards and a flimsy plastic tray. [...]"
4,Great Game!,This game is really fun! I played it as a kid and am so glad that I found it on amazon. The cards are the retro 60's version that I used to play with too. :)
5,mille borne review,This classic card game teaches math in a fun way. The addition is easy enough for kids 3rd grade and up
4,French Fun!,"A friend of mine had bought this old game at a garage sale, so we decided to try it out. I'm not usually a fan of car games, but this game is fast paced, easy to learn, and addicting to play. COUP FOURRE!!!"
5,A great game for all ages,"Highly recommend this...build a tradition in your family...easy to learn, but lots of strategy involved. Every game is different and fun! Get it."
2,"Classic card game, disappointing reissue","This is a great game, fun to play, wonderful cards with the original graphics I recall from childhood. That said, there is nothing collectable about this edition, except the cards themselves. I opened this large box, expecting some sort of storage tin, but there is nothing. It is a deck of cards, and a very flimsy plastic card tray made from the kind of plastic one finds used as packing material and instructions. Fifteen dollars for a deck of cards? Give me a break."
5,Great game!,"Mille Bourne is a great game to go on a ""car trip"", gaining mileage, fixing hazards and yelling ""coup de rae"" in French when you have the very special card that protects you from future hazards. A good family game with learning math built right in!"
3,Grandma & kids,I remember the game more foundly as a child playing it with my Grandmother. Good game for children.
4,A trip back in time,I remember playing this game for hours as a child so when my grandson started to really love card games I got it for him (he's 6). Now all the grandkids (ages 3 1/2 - 8) play every day when the older ones get home from school. I wanted the original art work so I got this collector's edition. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because you pay a premium just to get the original art and the little plastic tray.
5,Awesome Game!!!,I love this card game. It is very educational as well for the children. They learn the signs and can add. I would recommend this game to everyone from 3-101.
4,Mille Borne,"WE first got this game when my brother and I were still in grade school. We played the game in the summer. We would leave the game at the orchard durning the winter. We played this game for years and years. when I got older and I took my owm children to the orchard i found the game agian. My son and i started playing when he was about four. He loves games that have math in them. We now are about to buy our third copy of the game. I still have the frist copy of the game it is ratty and well worn but you can still play. I took the game to work with me and we love it as well. I have enjoyed this game andit is never the same game twice. You always have the chance to get all of the good cards, but that does not mean that you will win the game. Just ask my son. Thank you for still having the game so we can play and my children can show thier children when they have them."
4,Mille Borne,I loved finding this game because it is the same game I use to play with my grandfather as a kid. My 10 year old son thinks it is pretty great as well. It requires both luck and skill to play. It is a real classic card game.
4,Good cards bad tray,Very much alike the 1962 edition which I own too .Exellent playing card quality but the tray is impresive but poor quality and not very practical during game.
3,Mille Bornes Card Game,"We played this game when I was in my teens (1970's) and later with my kids when they were growing up (1990's). This past Christmas the kids asked if we still had the game around but it must have be thrown away at some point. After Christmas, we looked around at some of the local stores but could not find it so we went on line an got this one. My grandson (three years old) is a bit too young to be playing it but he was pretty thrilled with the pictures of the gas and fire trucks. He'll have to watch us play for a couple of years but it can be used to teach some basic counting skills. We are looking forward to playing this old family tradition the next time the kids are over for dinner. Bottom line...a bit pricey considering the cost of equivalent games at places like Walmart....but it seems that there is always a premium on the nostalgia market."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Such a great topic, but this book is written for academics only! The language and debates are incomprehensible to the average intelligent reader if she has not done graduate study in sociology or cultural studies.Like David Loftus's book on the same topic, the primary focus is to address the assertion of anti-porn feminists that porn is equal to violence against women (a 20 year old argument at this point). There is so much more to discuss, but Hardy, like Loftus, lets his enemy frame the language and topic of debate and does not ask questions of his own. Given the potential of the topic, it turns out to be a major disappointment.Further, the sample is only 12 or so people, which frankly, even for qualitative work is absurdly small. This book was written in England (before internet porn was available) where hard core porn is banned. So it addresses nothing more than softcore magazines and it's applicability to the American experience is questionable."
1,Not your mothers Liz Claiborne,I was looking for the original Liz Claiborne scent that I fell in love with in the Nineties. I was told that this was the one but it is definitely not the scent that it was back then. Both my wife and I were disappointed and I can't return it as they don't seem to allow returns on perfumes.Waste of money here.
5,"""My Favorite Perfume""",I have been using Liz Claiborne perfume for years. It is my favorite. And I was so exited to see that I could purchase the Eau De Toilette Spray online through Amazon.com.
1,What happened?,"Not the same product that I had used for many years! The outer packaging is the same but the bottle and scent are totally different and the fragrance is not pleasant at all. Very disappointing, especially when I checked the return info and it appears that it is not returnable. Plan to call and see what other options are available.If you are a long-time fan of the old Liz Claiborne, don't buy this product!!"
5,My Favorite,Liz is my favorite fragrance. I have used it for years. It melds with my body chemistry perfectly. I get compliments every time I wear it; without exception. It has become very difficult to find. Liz Claiborne has manufactured many new fragrances and for some reason this one has kind of gone by the wayside. So I was delighted to find it on Amazon and hope I will continue to be able to find there.
2,Just Okay,I wore this perfume years ago so I decided to try it since was so reasonably priced. It smells nothing like the scent I fell in love with. I will not purchase this again.
1,hated this scent,okay i am very picky about perfumes so maybe it is just me but i dont like this at all. the only reason i have not returned it is because i got it at a good price. i will be giving this away to someone who likes this scent or i will include it in my semi annual goodwill donations
5,My favorite!,I love this perfume! I was actually pleasantly surprised when I received it and realized it was the big bottle! I paid the same thing for the small bottle at Wal-Mart! Will be purchasing again!!!
3,only for weirdo's,if you listen to the 3o second previews the tracks sound like real songs but once you listen it sounds like a improvisational jam which it is.the first track and the hidden surprises inside make it worth buying .i wouldn't say this is a cd that you would listen to eveyday but if your in that certain weirdo mood this is for you.
4,Surprisingly pleased,"Being a newly acquainted Bowie owner, I was unsure of the right brand or type to look for. The Linder stag worked out very well on a camping trip last month. For taking down small trees or cleaning up firewood it was great. The handle is comfortable and Makes it proper for quick access."
3,Touchpad??,"I got one for my birthday about 2 weeks ago. One of the first things I've noticed is the touchpad, or, more specifically, the responsiveness of it. It is WAY too touchy at times, and at other times seems not to respond at all, mostly after I press the 'Menu' button. Functionally, its pretty good. I had no problems setting it up on Windows XP SP2. With the USB 2.0 port, transfers are quick! I like the way the Explorer is set up, however, unless you have ALL of your mp3 id tags set up properly, I'd suggest only transferring a few songs or one album at a time. I found that when using Windows Media Player 10, sometimes the computer locks up. All in all, its a nice buy if you need the space but don't have the cash. Otherwise, I might consider an ipod.JC"
2,Harddisk is awful,"I love a lot great features of this mp3 player. But one thing blow me off is the dard disk. I just bought it about two weeks, and the hard disk is broken. At first, I think it could be just rare defect product that I unfortunately bought it. But I see that so many reviews that talk about this problem even though when I call creative representive. I feel that they just try to shift the responsibility to their sub company. They say that inside of hard disk is not built by them. I just hope that they can really serious consider this problem. I just waste too much to install my songs into the this mp3, and finally it is all gone."
2,Creative Jukebox Zen Touch =Dell Jukebox with touch,"I bought a Creative Jukebox Zen touch to benchmark it against a Rio Carbon. Right out of the box I noticed the weight. It was more than I had in mind. A quick check of the included mini-manual told me that Creative did not recommend jogging with this unit. That was nearly a showstopper but I put it through a few paces anyway. The first thing that I noticed was that the operating system was practically a clone of my Dell Jukebox. That in itself is not a problem because the Dell system is pretty good.The real showstopper with this device was the touch pad. It is a capacitively coupled area that only requires a slight touch. In fact, you can get it to react to a near touch. That made it very difficult to select something from a list without the selection changing when you tried to lift you finger off of the pad. It was VERY hard to select accurately. After 15 minutes of trying to get the feel of it, I gave up. I am taking it back tomorrow."
1,Touchpad Difficult and Unresponsive,"My son got the Zen Touch for Christmas. After a full day of trying to get the touchpad to work consistantly, we decided to return the unit. The touchpad either did not respond to any pressure, or it skipped to the top or bottom selection and it took a lot of time to highlight the wanted item. Very frustrating. Nice concept, poor execution."
1,The iPod is better!,"Why get this when you can have the apple iPod? They're available in white and sleek black, with the innovative click wheel, easy-to-use menus, color display, and now video! PC or Mac. 30GB or 60GB. When it comes to MP3 players, Apple has totally dominated the market. You can see why!"
4,Great Player,"I absolutely love the player, after comparing all of my options I decided for the money,sound, and battery life. After using the player for a few months I have a few things to comment on and advise on a purchase.1. I never used the creative software after hearing the bad reviews, but had no problem using musicmatch and windows media player.2. The sound quality is way better than the 20 gig ipod. And almost the same cost as the mini.3. The price is $50 to $100 dollars less.4. Who cares about the games getting to the features on the ipod is a pain because of the 1 annoying scroll button.5. why pay for the name.6. more compatible with windows.7.BETTER playerThe only problems1. The case is annoying and you can't use the controls.2. Not as many accesories as the ipod such as skin, speakers etc."
5,Love it,"I am only writing a review because someone has a review entitled ""don't expect to use for more than a year"".I've had mine for 4 yrs and it still works just fine. I have to mention that I think in 4 yrs I've dropped it like 3 times. I've taken very good of it and it still works like new. It did freeze up on me a couple of times when I first got it which made me so mad. But the cust. service guy told me just to hit the reset button on the side with a paper clip. And it hasn't done it since.So I highly recommend this mp3 player."
2,Got to agree with TechnoBuff,"Had my zen just over a year. Moved house and discovered that half the buttons no longer work.I always had the problem that when I would hit skip track, 50% of the time it would pause instead.Very disappointing after a great start."
1,Nice...for a while,"This Machine was excellent, for a while. For the first 6 to 8 months i owned the machine, it worked great, it did exactly what i wanted, and it worked with my pc.then at about 9 months, it all went downhill. The touch pad, works about 10 % of the time, if im lucky. The buttons rarely do what they are marked to do, and the tech support was no help at all. And if you are an OS X user, forget about it. Overall, if you are going to buy this mp3 player, pay the extra couple bucks and get an ipod that is more reliable, holds more songs, has a better batery life, and is easier to use. I would not recomend this product to anyone!"
1,A VERY CREATIVE WAY TO WASTE MONEY AND TIME!!!,After ripping my entire cd collection (about 18 gigs!) the zen had to be reformatted. After doing this and ripping all my discs again!! the same thing happened !!! and has to be sent in for repairs. When I get it back Ill 'save' all my files to a 'hard drive' but isnt this what it is??
3,It still has some problems,"I have tested this new Zen touch in the last 7 days during my business trip. It does have good features e.g. easy to transfer MP3 files from my PC and software is very intunitive. The weight of this product is OK but just a little bulky than iPod. However I found two big problems which are very annoying and I may want to return this product. First, I just don't like its earphone, they are very uncomfortable and are little too big to fit well in your ears, and sound quality (volume control) is not as good as iPod. Typically when you listen to the music in a noisy place like the airport. Second, I had a couple of freeze during the trip, so I have to reset it. And it'll be useful to have a stop-button instead of just switching off the power.Based on this price, which is only 50 dollars less than a iPod, I would like to recommend iPod."
3,Good battery life but average sound quality,"It has many good features, espeicially battery, said by others. For me, the sound quality of a player is the key. The spec. says ""up to"" 97db of SNR but it sounds very average and less than iRiver, which only claims for 90db. I think the trick is ""up to"". Its sound output is even distorted when set EQ more than 8 in bass. Maybe Zen xtra sounds really good but not Touch. Buy iRiver I suggest. BTW I have low($20) and high($300) end headphone.iPOD does look sexyier."
2,No Linux or Mac Software,"If the company can't be bothered with us Linux and Mac users, why should we spend our hard earned money on their product? No support for these OSs smacks of arrogance. Very dissapointed, i will buy a Linux and Mac compatible player when I replace it. Creative have lost a future customer."
5,a decent I-pod substitute,"I bought this little guy for my daughter so that she could compete with my son's i-pod. I'm not too familiar with these things, but I had no problem setting it up and working it. Touch pad is great. Very sensitive and smooth.The sound is just awesome, that is, before it got burned in an apt fire. If you're looking for a serious replacement for the sometimes hard to get hold of i-pod, look no further. Creative is probably the only decent contender of i-pods"
4,Easy to use. Sounds great,"A very nice player. I had a Creative Zen Xtra before and blew out a head phone jack. This one seems to be less fragile in that the hard drive in the last player would quit any time it was dropped (I know. Don't drop it!) But this is used by my 14 year old who drops it sometimes. Fortunately she was always able to fix it by whacking it on the corner with the heel of her hand. Made me cringe but it worked every time.The Zen Touch is smaller than the Xtra but has the same features. We are very happy with it.Creative has it down. I wouldn't hesitate to buy any of their players. It would be nice if you didn't need to install software. The other MP3 players that we have (a Sandisk used by my 10 year old and an Archos PMA430 used by me) don't require any software, but rather look like a standard storage device when connected by USB. So I gave it 4 stars for that reason. Otherwise it's fabulous!"
1,"Buy With Caution, Don't Expect To Use More Than 1 Year","Before buying my Zen Touch I read some mixed reviews about the Zen Touch on Amazon. I purchased it anyway thinking that the problems described would not happen to me. I've had my player for 18 months and I am very, very disappointed. Not only does it freeze up with great regularity, but now the scrolling touch pad has completely broken, rendering the player useless. Go onto Creative's website discussion forum and you will see that the touch pad malfunction and other problems are alarmingly common.Think very hard before you buy this. I wish I had spent my money on an I-Pod."
2,BUTTON BREAKS !!!,"I had this unit for about 1 year now I hardley used it, I just took on my trip and I discovered the lock button broke for no apparant reason. I am buying IPOD, if I am going to spend couple of hundred $ at least I am going to buy the industry standard, not wanabe!"
1,Dont buy it,"I thought my Zen was a nifty little player until I watched a friend sync music and download new tunes on her Ipod. The Zen's software is clunky and slow and its ""playcenter'' computer interface freezes all the time - not good when you are transferring songs. Often, when I plug the player into the computer the playcenter announces that it isn't connected. Go ahead and pay a couple of hundred bucks for this thing and tell yourself you got a bargain by not buying the Apple. When it doesn't work, you'll have a shiny new doorstop."
2,unreliable,"i got this new zen touch last week and scroll stopped working second day.The sound effect really made me feel good first day but second day i could not scroll anything .I did all things like reset,going through customer service steps but no use.What i feel if it is little bit costlier better go with popular one as it is more reliable."
2,touch sensitive pad TOO sensitive.,"I bought the zen touch player straight from the creative website. At 249.00 it seemed like a decent alternative to the ipod. At first it seemed true. Sending my 1000 songs from my comp to the player took about 2 hours... Then everything fell apart... First the earphones that came with the product snaped in half when i tried to adjust it. 2nd as I tried to sort through the player with the zen touch pad, it almost seemed possesed, it would click on a song when i tried to scroll through the listings, and vice versa. I gave up after a day of frustration, sent the player back for a refund. I will say this though, the customer service dept. over at creative were very helpful, and processed my refund pretty quickly."
4,Creative Zen-The original,"There's a couple of nice things about the Creative Zen.The 20GB on average is about $50 less than the Apple iPod 20Gb, holds more songs and has a longer battery life. You can find cheaper MP3 players that are just as good or better than an iPod. I think people shouldn't take shopping around for a good player for granted."
2,Creative Replacement Policy is Crap,"I purchased this 20gig Creative Zen Touch in the begining of February and a little over two months later it has completely frozen up.It will not repond to anything except the reset button, which takes it exactly back to the same frozen state it was already in.In my frist call to tech support they adivsed I upgrade the firmware, which would of course not install b/c the Zen was in its frozen state. No big deal things break. However there standard return policy requires the purchasere of the product to pay for shipping, including insurance to their facility.I think that is a lously way to treat customers and I wanted to let all you folks know that if your player breaks, this is what you will have to deal with.As an aside, the HD seems to respond rather slow, the touch pad is WAY to sensitive (even after a months use at the least sensitive setting), and the packaged software sucks."
3,It Hangs,"I won't cover the entire player since there are so many other positive reviews here. I just want to defend the touch pad. In spite of what others say, it's very effective, but it is subtleThe Product is wonderful The main problem that it hangs a lot plus the rewind & forward buttons are not functioning well all the time they are sensitive & I failed to deal with them by all meansIf any one know how to deal with the rewind & forward buttons please contact me."
1,Creative MP3 Player Zen Touch ... think again!,I have 3 major problems with the operation of this unit:1) Playlist music cannot be played in a desired sequence. Normally it plays music in alphabetical order by artist's name OR randomly. The latest Creative software does not solve this problem.2) You CANNOT use Windows Media Player software to manage your music library and synch-to (download-to) the player. The Creative Media software is grossly inferior but MUST be used for this player.3) The lastest version of the Creative Media software has eliminated the importing of Playlists that were not created by this (inferior) program. The previous version did allow playlist importing.4) The touch control is ... well ... very touchy and often difficult. Compare this to the Iriver touch control which is much easier.I am going to get rid of mine unit ... anyone interested?
1,No mention of O/S problems by anyone?,This product would be excellent if I could just have it work on Windows 7. Just spent hours trying and reading blogs discussing how many people have the same problem.Amazon-Get this off your site as I and others are really annoyed about this product. Might as well have it run on Windows 95........
3,Not very user friendly,"My creative zen player came with virtually no instructions for its use. The online manual is very cryptic with primarily descriptions of the operations that this player can perform, but no instructions as to how to get it to perform these operations. Apparently this item is targeted for tech savvy folks who are presumed to know all about mp3 players and need no instructions. Ive had mine for over a month and have not figured out how to copy tunes from cds to the player. I would not recommend for folks who are not tech savvy."
2,Stopped working second day,What more can one say.Does this happen to an IPODI haven't heard anyone say it if it didMaybe too embarassed
1,Buy an I-Pod,"I went the more frugal route of purchasing a Creative Labs MP3 player not once, but twice!!! On both occasions, the units have simply stopped functioning. I am now stuck with two units that are now glorified paper weights. The message is simple... Buy an I-Pod."
1,Almost an iPod,"It's almost like an iPod. It's interface almost works. The spastic finger up, finger down navigation almost works. It's weight is almost as light as an iPod. It's navigation is almost intuitive like the iPod's. If you're willing to spend $30 less for an second rate MP3 player almost as good as an iPod then this is for you... of course you could just buy the iPod and not always wonder what you'd be missing out on."
3,iPod Wannabe!!!,"In all the reviews people say ""iPods suck"" or ""iPods cost too much money!"" well if they suck so much how come Creative has clearly COPIED some of the features??????? i agree that the iPod costs a lot of money but this is kind of like buying a ""fake"" iPod. this shows that most people who buy it actually want an iPod but can't afford it or don't want to fish out the extra $39 (the original price for the zen is $269.99), although that is completely fine. and for those people who have both the iPod and the Zen: if u think the iPod is so expensive why do u buy BOTH the Zen AND the iPod?? as if that is going to save you any money. the zen may have a really good price and some better qualities than the iPod, but there is no denying it is an iPod WANNABE!!!!!!!"
3,Great sound for barebones player,"I bought this player about 9 months ago, having owned a few other of their players. It does sound great, BUT, Creative, it seems, has decided not to follow-up on their firmware update support. No drive letter support, no Plays for Sure support, and as far as I know, the Equalizer has never worked, its been promised, but not supplied. So, before buying, you should read for yourself in the Creative Labs forum."
4,Great,"This is great MP3. The downside is its a bit big and a bit thick but it is so easy to transfer files. Just drag the file over and drop. Ive only had it for 3 days and i have 119 songs all at around 150-200 kbps range and it sounds great. The headphones that come with it are anooying though because the right is longer than the left and you have to put it around your neck so they even out. All in all its good mp3 player if you have a small budgetpros:great quality sound, easy interface, battery life is 24 hours, the vertical touchpad is better than he clickwheel, plus you get a black case that clips on to your pants for portabilitycons: looks like a white brick, very thick. (half the size of a 20.oz coke can)screen scratches way to easily"
4,I like it,"Says it can overheat when plugged in for too long, but ive left mine plugged in for a while and not only is it not hot, its chilled! It has great sound quality and is smaller than i thought it would be. Touchpad is too touchy tho so hopefully that will be fixed in a firmware release. It sorts all my tracks with artist and album but then it can only sort the tracks by names which sucks because i like it by track like on cds. I am currently in the process or renaming ALL my mp3's to include ""01"" or ""02"" etc in the front so they sort right. Thats why this doesnt get a 5. Battery life is outstanding as u know already. Software and price is the main reason i chose this over ipod, ive used both and i cant stand itunes and the nomad explorer is great for me. check out pricegrabber.com, can get this for as little as ~$230."
5,What everyone soar on Ipod has been waiting for.,"Pros: This unit offers durability, ease of use, great sound, 24 hour battery life ( I got 22 hrs out of it the first use) and competitive price. I am very satisfied with the player. It took me 10-15 minutes to become comfortable with the menu and xfering software that is included with the player.The touch navigation is very responsive and exact. It's very sturdy and well built. It comes with an included leather case and headphones. Cons: The case is anoying. It keeps the player well protected, but you have to remove it to get at the players buttons. Pulling the unit in and out will change your music selection unless you have locked the player.It's kind of heavy. Could second as a self-defense weapon. Over all I love it though"
4,Seriously fun,"I read a lot of reviews before I bought the Zen Touch - a lot seemed to focus on the touch bar and it's sensitivity (or lack of). I seemed to get the hang of it pretty much as soon as I started using it. The battery really lasts forever! I loved this as I recently used it on a long trip: flight in the US+transatlantic flight+flight in Europe - there was juice to spare after all this. Also the music transfers from my computer with the USB2.0 are blazing fast.Why 4 starts instead of 5? Little details: 1. the earbuds are uncomfortable (I got a set of full-size headphones and the music quality is unreal), 2. the music download software that came with the Zen Touch is a little squirrely - nothing serious, but it takes some getting used to, 3. I like the leather-look case, but you need to lock the player when you slide it in and you don't have access to any of the buttons when it is in the case.Would I buy it again if I could do this all over - YOU BET!"
4,Player Near Perfection,"I think this product is awesome! The only problem I encountered is that a small number of my music files cannot be transferred onto the player because they are an ""incorrect"" file format, but it has been for less than 20 files out of 1900, so it's not that big of a deal.It plays great, awesome battery life, great scroll features, basically your typical Ipod but $150 cheaper! I love it!"
3,not bad,"cons - froze in the first 5 minutes i used it and had to reset it (worked fine after that)- the random play button will play some of the same songs repeatedly, as in up to 2-3 times per 15-20 songs, even with a play list near 1000 songs- it's a little heavy, and definitely feels bulky with the included belt clip case- you have to buy an extra accessory ($65) to be able to listen to and record the radio and voice memos- volume doesn't turn up very loud- couldn't use the included earphones because a weird plastic piece had practically fused the R and L ear bud wires at different lengths- can't use as a portable hard drive without software on the computer you're moving stuff to and frompros - most music sounds pretty good, except the included classical music which is very faint- good price compared to the ipod- really easy and quick to add music- plays most audio formats"
3,Conflicts Conflicts Conflicts,"It's hard to say who is to blame, Microsoft or Creative. There is some problem where Windows Media Player 10 conflicts with the Zen driver for Windows XP. Otherwise this is a 5-star piece of hardware. I like the interface better than what I have seen on iPods. But now I kind of wish I'd have bought one of the iRiver 5GB players with the color screen. Those look awesome and probably work better with Media Player 10."
1,"If you're looking for something easy to use, think again....","A nice piece of equipment with good sound. Unfortunately the documentation is substandard and the technical support is a practical joke - it's supposedly free for 60 days (not exactly generous is it?), but the catch is that it's a long-distance number and only open during office hours - you'd better be independently wealthy or have a very understanding boss.The website claims to be award-winning or some such thing but the Knowledge Base's designation flatters itself - very little knowledge.For the first two weeks I struggled to get it to record some of my favourite music. Constant problems with files not ripping or disappearing or being refused because they were apparently already on my pc. This wasn't the case and I got fed up of asking technical support for help. They'd give me answers but never to the question I'd actually asked.So, my wife has had an Ipod for months with no problems. Guess what I wish I'd bought?"
2,ok...,"get a ZEN Sleek instead. only like $30 more, better quality, a radio reciever, never has frozen on me, very user friendly (both software and player)"
5,Touch pad is under-rated.,"I've very pleased with my Touch but I won't cover the entire player since there are so many other positive reviews here. I just want to defend the touch pad. In spite of what others say, it's very effective, but it is subtle. It has a slow zone in the center and fast zones at the top and the bottom for fast scrolling. Many people complain that it's difficult to scroll 1 or 2 lines at a time. For slow scrolling, repeated short strokes at the center of the pad work best. Once you develop a touch for the touch pad, you're navigating like a pro. It's subtle like a musical instrument, but satisfying to use."
2,Long term review,"Most reviews are by users who have used the zen touch for a short period of time. I have owned by zen touch for about a year and a half. At first, I loved the machine--I could treat it like a hard drive, use windows file types, transfer from machine to machine, etc. However, I have had some MAJOR problems lately:1. The scroll function doesn't always work. When I try to scroll up, it scrolls down.2. Some of the buttons don't do what they are supposed to. I press play, and it skips to the next track. I press skip to the next track, and it pauses. Huh?And, most of all, I left it to charge one day and upon returning, it WOULDN'T TURN ON. After scouring the help boards and emailing creative, I was told the machine was busted. Great. The warranty is, of course, expired, and there's nothing I can do. The tech support was horrible, and as much as I like a lot of the features, these problems are bad ones. I plan never to buy a creative product again."
4,Very good player,"I did an enormous amount of research before buying my first MP3 player, and settled on the Creative Zen Touch 20GB. For the most part, I think it was a good purchase. I've loaded over 1300 songs (including more than half a dozen books) and I've barely used half the 20GB capacity. I don't use the earbuds supplied with the Zen Touch, though. I had my own Sony noise-cancelling headphones instead, and that creates a perfect combination. The sound is excellent, and although the unit's heavier than many others on the market, it hasn't been a problem in any way. I use it at work (at a desk) and on flights. My only quibble with the unit is that I find the promised 24 hours of battery life is optimistic by half. Still, 12 hours is decent, and for sound quality, the variety of formats and ease of downloading, it's a great gadget!"
1,great for 6 months,I truly loved this mp3 until it required that I clean up the hard drive. Then what a peice of junk this turned out to be. At the point and time in which u have to defrag this crap is the time in which u send it in to be repaired or the time in which u throw it out of the window. I suggest choosing the latter.
2,So far not impressed,"I own a 20gb iPod. Wanted to get an MP3 for my son and this seemed like a good alternative. Gave it to him for Christmas. After charging it then downloading all seemed well. Then when he went to use the lock button for the first time it broke off and the player was stuck in locked mode and unusable. Trying to return now. Can't tell if this was a fluke or not. The button seemed flimsy, certainly compared to my iPod's. Would have liked for this to work since $100 cheaper for same size iPod. But will fork over the extra $$$ for the more durable pod..."
1,Dont' waste your money,"theoretically this is a much better machine than the ipod - cheaper, just as user friendly and doesn't drive you into Apple's intrusive proprietary format......Here's the downside.........The PC interface is junk. I have owned several machines and it seems they only work for the inital set up and synch and after that the handheld doesn't connect with the PC. I have tried upgrading the firmware and that doesn't help - I have wasted days trying to get this solved. Try talking to Creative on line -their process is clearly designed to discourage customer contact.I tried an Ipod this week and sent that back because its software doesn't convert my 15000 WMA files (all legally owned)So I am going to sit out the next year............and send back the Creative Zen Touch I bought from my daughter. No wonder creative have such a small piece of the market"
5,Great MP3 Player,"This is the best MP3 player I have ever used. The touch pad is excellent if you are capable of moving your thumb up and down with control then you can use the touch pad like a pro. It will be difficult at first but you'll get used to it. You can also modify the sensitivity to your liking. Its small and about a 2 pounds. I have no problems so far but I've only had it for less than a day. Excellent great design, can be used with one hand, I love the blue light for the power button.Great buy if you don't want to spend 250-300 dollars for an IPOD that hold the same amount of songs. I recommend this to anyone."
2,Brilliant.... for a while....,"I got my Creative player for my birthday (just before Christmas). I absolutely loved the device, the software, even the scroll bar! However, by mid-march, things had started to go horribly wrong; the sound on the right hand side doesn't work, the battery won't stay charged (for example, I charged it, didn't use it at all, then when I turned it on a few days later the battery was dead!) and, despite never jogging or 'bouncing' it, I've had to restart the device on numerous occasions. Another downer is the lack of support from Creative - even though the product is still under warranty, they have made me contact an array of other suppliers to get a new player.I would recommend this player however, consider all options before buying!"
2,Too much garbage talk,"Some useful information, but way too much useless garbage,they could compress this book to about 1/4 of the size"
1,Caveat Emptor,"Buyer bewareThis may a great CD. However, the CD you'll receive will probably differ from the one depicted here in the track listing.The cover and title are identical. But I still haven't (as of August 21, 2006) found the CD listed here (with Folsom Prison Blues as the first track). Instead, I have received (on two occasions) received a different CD with ""Hey Porter"" as the first track"
1,Doesn't work. No support.,"The ice cream maker arrived broken. It stops during a batch and won't restart. Cuisinart ""support"" would not return my emails or phone calls. I will never buy another cuisinart product. Requested refund from Amazon."
4,Makes great ice cream!,"Great machine, no planning needed, no bowl to freeze and and worry about loosing it's cold before your ice cream is frozen. Plan on locking it in a seperate room though, it is REALLY noisy."
2,Works well .......,"Makes great ice cream, and I really enjoyed it, until things started going wrong. The top part started getting harder and harder to attach, andI had to put a weight on the top top part to keep it from coming loose and stopping while churning (cranking).Then the plastic knob stripped, and I used pliers to turn it on and off! Finally, after falling out of "" in-love "", I've decided that the noise ALWAYS did bother me, but I put up with it..It now sits in our garage. I use it once a year! Not nearly worth the price!"
1,"Bad design, defective after one batch, sending it back","Will be very happy to get my money back from this. The first batch of ice cream I made with this was runny and soupy (despite following directions for ""hard"" ice cream). The unit stopped working in the middle of the second batch and won't turn on again. This is also very noisy; we thought maybe we could have it making ice cream while preparing a meal but it's really too annoying to be around. As other reviewers have noted, the plastic cover is fiddly and seems destined to break. Bad experiment, this is going straight back to Amazon."
2,Disappointed,"I received this item as a wedding present. I was as happy as a pig in mud....until I actually used it. I didn't get to use it until 3 weeks after receiving the unit. It was sitting on a shelf. I took it down, read the manual, chilled my ingredients, mixed them up, poured them in, set the timer to 45 minutes and let her rip. After 45 minutes I still had a milky mixture, tasty but still watery. I set the timer for another 45 minutes. Same story. I then took the bowl out, put it in the freezer for a couple of hours put it back in the machine and turned it on for another 40 minutes and voila tasty cold milk. Product stinks. That's what I get for being lazy should have asked for the tried and true old fashioned crank model. It might take longer and be more inconvenient but the end product is excellent."
3,batch after batch but still disappointed,"The good:The freezer works GREAT! We have made batch after batch of creamy fresh summer fruit ice creams. Yes, it's noisy but who cares. It just reminds you that yummy ice cream is on it's way.The bad:The stainless steel casing came totally streaked with rust that won't scrub off. It was very disappointing when we pulled it out of the box to find such a grungy looking machine. I guess I should have sent it back."
3,Super ice cream,The first machine i bought was way too loud. I had Amazon replace it and it is much better now. It is easy to clean and makes great ice cream.
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"While this machine has a leg up on all of the other affordable machines because of the compressor unit (bowl does not need to be chilled before each use), it was a bust. The motor is not strong enough to spin the wand in the ice cream bowl as it begins to harden. Fearful that I would burn the motor out, I had to turn off the machine before my ice cream was properly aerated (spun). I very regretfully returned the machine."
2,ALMOST COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT,"2 STARS....It makes ice cream ....just like it says.Doesn't matter to some that it is the consistency of heavy soup.But in a stretch ...it is still ice cream..after 1 and 1/2 hours of whiningnoise in my kitchen. Think I liked the old machines much better ..with themessy ice and salt and same noise. But, sometimes you just can't replacethe old rat trap. This isn't even a good try."
2,Poor Quality Increasingly Evident Over Time,"This ice cream maker seems like a great idea - it's inexpensive for a maker with a built in freezer - but the quality is very low. Pieces like the lid break easily. The arm is always popping off the machine. And worst of all, the stirrer does a terrible job scraping the edge of the bowl. That freezers up quickly and soon the stirrer gets stuck and stops - leaving you with icy stuff on the outside and liquid at the middle of the bowl. This is no good for the texture of the finished product. I used this produce 20+ times in the course of a year, but have since switched to using aKitchenAid KICA0WH Ice Cream Maker Attachmentwith much better results."
4,More Torque Please,Refrigeration system works very well. The agitator has very little torque (power) and often stops before the ice cream can be very firm. Agitator is completely plastic and likely will be easily broken.
1,NO!,"Crappy, worked once so loud we couldn't stand it, then it never worked again.Can't get anyone to repair whatever is wrong with it, Cuisinart doesn't want to deal with it, bought from Cutlery and More, their phone number doesn't work, it sucks.I'm going to throw it away or use it for a boat anchor!Had only ONE very expensive cup of Ice cream.very frustrating!"
1,I would rate it a zero if possible,"I read the other reviews and was optimistic. Let me tell you, I tried four times after reading the manual and re-purchasing ingredients and it does not work. It does however make an excellent paper-weight and does stir the ingredients! I had only soup after four attempts-I even chilled the ingredients in freezer first. This is an awful machine that does not work. Now maybe mine was broken in shipping but if it is that sensitive then you do not want to order it-by the way if it is ever tilted on its side or upside down you have to let it sit for over 24 hours before you can use it and I found it on my doorstep on its side despite the ""This side up"" signs all over it-apparently that is rocket science. I am going back to my messy but functional ice and salt cranker. I can not tell you how disappointed I am."
2,over prices ice cream maker,The machine is slow and loud. The plastic lid is very fragile and breaks easily. The machine only makes a small amount at a time and does not freeze very well. If I would of kept the box I would have returned it.
2,"good, but....","THis was a pretty good ice cream maker, it was nice in that the compressor was part of the machine, it was rather heavy and loud and the mixer does not scrape the sides very well. The other problem I encountered was the quality of the container. When the mixture is frozen the container is difficult to release from the well and the handle is so flimzy that it comes unattached making it very difficult to remove the container of ice cream until it has warmed slightly and released."
4,I'd buy it again,"Purchased this ice cream maker in October and am very pleased with it. It is noisy, however, I just place it in the laundry room while it is running. The results are well worth the noise. The ice cream maker is very easy to use and the ice cream texture is perfect. I've made several batches from the recipe book that comes with it that have turned out great. Tip, be sure to use pasturized eggs for raw egg ice cream recipes."
4,Great kitchen appliance,"If your time is short, and whose isn't, then this is the machine for your homemade ice cream. Follow the directions, add ingredients, eat ice cream in one hour. Easy clean up. Up side, we now begin to experiment. Down side, the machine is heavy for the wife to put away. I built a special little table to store off the pantry floor."
2,Not really commercial quality,"This machine is nowhere near a commercial ice cream maker. Key parts are very flimsy. It makes a tremendous amount of noise while operating. And the ice cream is very grainy, not like real premium ice cream."
2,Lid doesn't fit right...,"I am not dissapointed with the ice-cream, but after putting the lid together and fastening in the motor arm it doesn't want to stay in. It keeps popping up and therefore the machine wants to stop..I put a small book on top of the motor arm then it stayed down long enough to churn, but in the process started smoking a little..I finally cut it off..afraid to use it until someone can tell me why the motor arm isn't staying down in place."
1,Useless,"This looks the business but after my second machine I have had to get a refund.The first time, the motor arm began to smoke after about 30 seconds (churning a basic vanilla custard base) and then literally blew up!The second one seemed to be working fine, but after about 20 mins churning the same mixture (still runny at the time) but then it, and everything else in my apartment stopped, as it blew the main fuse. It would then not turn on without again tripping the fuse box.Sorry Cuisinart - this is a dud!"
2,Don't love this...,"I love most Cuisinart products, but not this.Pros - No bowl to pre-freeze.Cons - Heavy, Noisy, Design issues. The paddle portion is plastic. The freezing begins quickly and the plastic paddle isn't heavy enough to keep the sides of the container scraped down. The ice cream begins to freeze on the sides of the container, the paddle stops moving and you end up with about a half inch of ice cream on the sides of the container and liquid in the middle.I could deal with the weight and the noise...if it worked well. Sending this back."
4,Amazing machine but loud,"If it weren't for the noise level, I would rate this a 5. This machine is amazing. Makes great hard or soft ice cream, using milk, coconut milk, and comes with some great recipes. I already have ""orders"" from friends & family."
5,this makes the yummiest ever ice cream,I can make it healthy or not...this is really a fun machine. My grand kids love it when we start making ice cream.
1,Cuisinart must pay people to write reviews...,"...because this is truly one of their worst products ever. The entire unit has some weight to it, but important pieces, such as the arm that stirs the ice cream, are made of cheap grade plastic. After multiple attempts at making ice cream, following recipes included with the unit to the letter, all I got was a soupy mess with a thin layer of cream frozen solid against the side of the bowl. I returned the unit for a full refund, and you probably will too."
5,Beverlymae,"i love my ice cream maker, We make home made ice cream almost every night before bed.. my son especially loves freshice cream... If this one every wears out, I will buy another one, it is so much easier than the old ones where you add salk and ice.... this requires no salt or ice, which is great and it saves us money in the long run.. My mom was also impressed with it, and She also bought one, My sister was also impressed and she also bought one.. so our family is all going to get fat together,... lol.. gained 25 pounds so far.."
1,Totally unexpected unreliability,"I bought this for my husband as a Father's Day gift. I ordered early and waited in anticipation of his opening it. He was pleased and excited about what kind of ice cream or yogurt we could make right in our own kitchen. I proceeded with putting together a good recipe for vanilla ice cream using vanilla beans. Everything was ready to go except for the ICE - 50BC. It would not start. We tried everything except taking it apart. The only thing that worked was the timer. Manually wound it ticked away. We utilized the appropriate power outlets, plugging it in to more than just one to be sure. The failure was not a result of the machine being stored upside down or any thing that would have caused it to fail. It just did not work. Would I trust that machine again? NO way. If it did not work from the start, what happens in 6 months or a year? Forget it. BEWARE OF THIS ONE...Still looking for the right one, a good quality piece of merchandise..."
3,Loud and sometimes over-freezes at the bottom,"I tried using sugar substitue and fat-free milk to make ice cream. Don't do it. It will over-freeze at the bottom of the pail and stop working. Following recipes in the booklet seems to work OK.It is also VERY loud. If you're going to be entertaining, make the ice cream long before evryone arrives or you'll never be heard over the racket.It is the best value for what it is, but it needs some product improvement from Cuisinart."
1,Big Disappointment,We were very disappointed with this ice cream maker. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband. We didn't even get to eat ice cream as it simply didn't work. All we could get was a refund. We contacted Cuisinart and they did nothing. All around huge disappointment.
1,Very Disappointed in this,The ice cream was okay -it may be that I bought a refurb and that was of lesser quality but after about 100 days (with a 90 day warranty) mine quit working!
3,"Wow, it's loud","I suspect that different machines have different levels of noise, since my version is at least twice as loud as my old, loud dishwasher. We're talking Harley-Davidson with straight pipes loud. My wife won't let me run it with her in the house.On the other hand, other than the noise it works wonderfully. I'm still glad I have it, but I sure wish that it was quieter."
1,beware,"We thought buying this machine would eliminate having to replace the cheaper electric churn machines....we have used this expensive unit only five times and the compressor is shot and turn motor screams so loud you cant be in the same area of the house with it...at 300.00, i expected much more than the life of this unit by cruisart. very very dissatisfied and disappointed.Cuisinart ICE-50BC Supreme Ice Cream Maker"
2,Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker review,"This product freezes the mixtures well and they turn out smooth & creamy, but the plastic lid is a piece of junk. It has two little pieces of plastic that stick up and hold the arm in position during freezing but they are inadequate and break way too easily. This is an expensive product and in my opinion should be better made since it is from Cuisinart. The unit was made in China, like so many of the products these days. Had I known that before ordering, I would have passed and purchased the old fashioned kind that uses ice and salt to freeze."
3,Supreme Ice cream maker?,"I think tha machine is good, but not very good. Cuisinart's people offers a supreme ice cream, but not real, the ice cream is acceptable, but no supreme. I have two year whit this machine and the last year has been saved in the box.Ohther thing, scraper blade are very detached from the container and rotates very slowly, the compressor is very slow to freeze and for design reasons does not make a commercial quality ice cream.Sorry but can't make ice cream continuosly, you must wait 20 or 30 minutes to try once again. Sorry, but this items is to domestic quality, no commercial or supreme quality. I recommend llelo ice cream maker machine"
4,Very Convenient,It is very easy to make up a batch of homemade ice cream now. We set the maker outside by our grill so that we don't have to listen to it. The only issue is that it doesn't turn itself off when the paddle stops turning so you need to pay attention.
4,Great ice cream with little fuss,"Initially I was unhappy with this machine, was going to send it back. But then I dug out my old ice cream recipes and used them rather than the ones from the book that came with it. The recipes in the book are okay, but there are a lot better ones out there.I did not give this five stars because there is some pleasure in hand cranking ice cream ~ you put a bit of yourself and your energy into it. And it may be just a tad creamier when hand cranked. The second reason for only four stars is the noise. However, the noise issue has been solved by setting it on a table in my pantry.As for hand cranking, I will save that for family reunions in the summertime. On Thanksgiving Day, with absolutely no attention, this machine was cranking out some lovely lemon-flavored buttermilk ice cream while we were eating our dinner. Now what could be better than that?"
2,Ice Cream Maker,It is very difficult to get the top on correctly to plug in plus attach the mixing apparatus. Had another make of this type of freezer and it was so much easier to set up.
4,Creamy Dreamy,"This Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker is wonderful. I received it for a gift and love it. One thing we've found is to get truly creamy ice cream a cooked custard base is the best. While the compressor is a bit loud, it's worth every decibel!"
4,yummy ice cream,I had tried a different ice cream maker that you had to freeze the bowl and returned it. It was too annoying to keep freezing the bowl and it took up too much space in my freezer. I love the cuisinaret Ice-50bc it makes great ice cream. The only negative is the noise and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is extremely noisy so I pretty much have to leave the room when it's on. I do recommend the Ben and Jerry's ice cream book but wish they would revise it or do another one. See my review on it.
1,Don't get stuck with this piece of junk,"The very first time I tried to use it, the motor seized up while the ""ice cream"" was still a liquidy gooey mess. It still had 15 minutes to go on a 60 minute cycle. Putting this in the freezer to continue freezing at this point will give me frozen cream with chunks of ice in it, not ice cream.To top it all off, the dasher is stuck on the arm and I can't get it loosened - it pulls the entire mounting piece out of the motor arm and it STILL won't come apart. No particular pressure was put on this, it appears that it just went on slightly dowhonkers and jammed.I had read the negative review but figured there were more positive than negative reviews. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, and given less weight to my 25 year old Cuisinart food processor's long life. Cuisinarts really AREN'T what they used to be. Now I'm out about $300 - total waste of money."
1,wow this is bad,"Am I disappointed!!! shoddy construction, just doesnt 'fit' or work well together. the machine shuts off intermittently (manual says it will do this when the ice cream becomes too thick and hard to churn) and when the ice cream is still VERY soft. LOUD!!!...too loud. with this price and Cuisinart's usual quality, I expected much more. NOT a satisfactory purchase.....at all......"
3,Genet: A Biography of Janet Flanner,"Tells Janet Flanner's story with details about her life, especially among the writers of Paris in the 20's. Interesting details and explanations of her approach to writing her Letter from Paris for the New Yorker."
5,A MUST for anyone creating graphics in the digital age!,"I find this book to be a valuable resource for dealing with FreeHand. Basic through advanced levels of users will find helpful information. The projects are clearly designed to help you get familiar with the software quikly, but they also include challenging design elements. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs to create digital drawings."
2,Not for Beginners,"This book is for students who already have some knowledge of Freehand and want to learn more on graphic design using Freehand from David Bergsland's professional experience. The book is printed on a thin paper, black and white. Putting in some color would have helped to better organize this book."
4,"Excellent little book, fascimle quality could be better","This is a great read both historically and for the student of math.More interesting is if you read a modern text analyzing DeCartes to see where he struggled. Such as with complex roots.Yes there are way better instructional texts.My one issue with this book, well two actually is the facsimile of the orginal could be better. And each page faces each other, so you can see the translation and the original. One thing they did not do is copy the diagrams from the original. It is minor, but I like working the problems, and I wish they had them in the translation as well. It would help with the alignment and make it a bit more user friendly.For the price it is a bargain."
1,has only limited historical value,"The problems discussed in this book are very remote from ourpresent day geometry. The English translation uses a smaller fontthan the French original, which makes the book even harder to read."
3,It's a real cute thing,"An excellent shape with millenium color supported by advance technology, good looking and match with any design of every room of the youth."
3,good book,"good book but overpriced.when i bought this i thought from the price they charged it was still out of print. i was disappointed when i went in to a local bookstore to check out something else, and found this book for $10 cheaper"
4,Good early Negativland,"This is one of the first Negativland CD's I stumbled across. Odd, silly, noisy, and very entertaining. This stuff boggles the mind."
5,The Original is Still the Greatest!,"In my humble opinion, no one weaves an adventure tale better than Clive Cussler. I have been riding the wave of his stories since ""Raise the Titanic"" was first published. He extends that long tradition of storytelling in his latest thriller. I also like the idea that Cussler has more recently begun to include other writers on the by-line, in this case Paul Kemprecos. Perhaps Kemprecos' earlier books will reappear in print.Dr. Cussler again returns with his tried and proven formula and even dabbles into the realm of fantasy: something he has done at least once before. Kurt Austin has become a force in his own right and will soon stand shoulder to shoulder with Dirk Pitt.I agree. Men AND women will enjoy ""Polar Shift."""
2,Mr. Cussler. Please write your own books.,"I think I've read everything Mr. Cussler has had published. Sorry to say, Polar Shift is boring. If I had to guess, some marketing person talked Mr. Cussler into this co-authoring and subsequently cheating us, the buying public. I'm pretty sure I won't buy another co-authored book, period. If you want to read Mr. Cussler at his best, look for an earlier book. They can be some of the best entertainment reading there is. But, I won't recommend Polar Shift.Kurt Austin is a 'watered down' Dirk Pitt. I wish Mr. Cussler had explored the more human and flawed side of a Dirk Pitt in Kurt Austin instead of making him less exciting and stopping there."
4,Better than average,Generally Clive Cussler books have gone downhill for the last 20 years or so. They now seemed to be aimed at 14 year olds rather than adults and the writing style is appropriate for that market. This is a shame as books such as Night Probe were really outstsnding.I started to read this book yesterday on a long flight and so far it has gripped me more than most of the Cussler Franchise output of late. Could this be because Paul Kemprecos is actually a better writer?
3,bland and no action,bland and no action compared to all the many others I have from Cussler! This is interesting and follows his pattern of world doom and Numa save! It is just NOT a worthwhile buy! Save your money and rent or get it at your library. It is like going to a movie and wondering why you spent the money!
3,Polar Shift,This the worst book I have read from Clive Cussler as all the action was in the last few pages. This not the normal way he writes his books. Is he running out of ideas?
4,polar shift,i am very happy with polar shift it was in good condition and was done reading in 3 days and am now serchin 4 my next clive cussler
3,Could it happen?,"Have read all of Cussler's books. Polar Shift is packed with adventures, but too much scientific data to wade thru.Kurt is ok, but I enjoy Dirk's adventures more."
3,Where is Dirk when you need him?,"Cussler is still an excellent writer, but the Dirk Pitt books were far superior."
2,"Same Formula, No Shift Here","Polar Shift is an incredibly formulaic book, with quite a few borrowed plot points from other generic adventure-action books. Entertaining at times, but very generic, and sloppily written, as if the authors had to crank out yet another novel before the deadline. Very little labor of love exhibited in the writing, I felt like the authors were just punching a time clock to collect their pay."
1,not a happy camper,"I ordered this product the first of August, This is Sept 4. I still have not received the book! Is there something I can do to get my money back or receive the book?"
3,it's ok,"This is an ok filter but not really anything to write home about.I was a little disappointed in the plastic cover. I expected something more than just plain plastic, but thats all it is. The filter itself is a little small as well. I expect I will have to clean it often and I question how much air flow it can actually get.It is good for directing where the filter pulls air from. Unlike regular ""open"" filter that pull air in from all sides (including the hot engine) this allows you to pull air from only cool spots, like headlight holes, or something like that."
4,Mostly for Tiny Tim Longtime Fans,"It's hard not to call this ""Tiny Tim Unplugged"" (although a 1995 album with that title did arrive from an label in Alabama). But this '94 effort is done apprently only for the engineers and othes at the New York Studio, not in a Concert format.This CD is a nice complement to the book by Harry Stein (Playboy Press, 1976). Tiny's wonderful baritone to falsetto voice box sounds a tad frayed but altogether it hangs in their for many short snippets and for longer, exquisite love letters to his ""dreamgirls"" of the '40, '50s, and '60s, particularly to ""Annie Halsey"" and ""Tuesday Weld"". There's a pretty good poem to a young Elizabeth Taylor; and very strong folk tune called ""Whispering Voices"", with echos of the gramophone era. A successful meeting of 1914 and 1994."
2,"Beware! Store bought CD's play fine, but CD-R's may not!","Sony warns that this player may have difficulty with some CD-R and CD-RW disks, as well as with some CD writers. I happen to have burned quite a few disks with a QPS disk burner (on 3 different brands of CD-R) and none of them will work in this player without skipping a lot, MP3 disks and standard CD format. The funny thing is that the same burned disks that have standard CD tracks play perfectly well on the the Sony D-F200 and D-E350 portable players. Go figure. Anyways, try to demo one of these with the media that you use or buy from a place that is easy to return things without a restocking fee. Also, sound level is a little low, probably because Sony doesn't include their usual selectable volume limiter on this model."
5,great CD and mp3 player,"This has the best sound I've ever heard on CD's and mp3's. it plays them great at 128k. I hear little details in each song that I couldn't hear otherwise. the cd quality, on the other hand is even more outstanding. When burning CD's be careful to use the right burning format, also, make sure to do it in disk at once, otherwise it will split each song into 5, but if it's done right, it works flawlessly, I've never had a problem with it. The batteries last as long as sony says they do, but my only complaint is that the CD stops when the an mp3 is going, and when the song is over, it has to start spinning to read it again, and it takes too long to switch songs with low batteries, but its a lot faster with brand new ones. This thing is great, I get all my songs from the internet, and burn 200 of them onto a cd. Its incredbly easy to navigate if you put the songs in folders, like the bands."
2,a follow-up to my 6/22/02 review,"It won't play CD-R/RW's anymore. I don't know why. It just keeps spinning the disc really fast and doesn't do anything. I got frustrated and pounded it... it broke. NO CD player I've had has ever broken because of a simple hit. Not even my ANCIENT Sony Discman. I broke it. Boo Hoo. A waste ... after 10 months use... I've gotten more use out of my 5 year old Discman. This thing really ruined my impression on Sony. One time, it spun a CD-R for so long before I stopped it that it ripped the film off the top of the CD, therefore making it useless. So disappointing. I hope not everyone has this problem."
2,another piece of Sony junk,i've had this mp3 player for a year. It takes forever to load and keeps skipping to the next track without me touching it. It seems like every Sony product I buy breaks!
3,Old voices,"I am grown up with this music in the sixties. At that time their voices were full of passion. The tunes are there allright, but one can hear that they sang these songs over and over again. Now the recording themselves are probably better than they were in those days, but it are old voices one is listening to. I am still waiting to find a CD which contains the old original stuff."
1,hated it,"The item was either used or had not been kept in very good condition . The disc that came with the cd was broken in half . Said the book was ""new"" but I don't know about that ."
5,A fine method for fine learners,"I received the book one week ago... however, I am still waiting for my LaPatrie Hybrid guitar ordered five months ago. Nevertheless, I feel strongly this method is made for me. The presentation is enjoyable (the book stays open when you need it does, layout is clean, etc), lessons are intelligently graded, not childish at all. CD's tracks cover a wide range of styles and gives the reader impulse to experiment much more than classic, the style usually associated with nylon-string guitar, the kind of instrument the book is (fortunately) oriented to. An excellent tool to learn flying your own wings. A well-cut gem."
3,So-So,"Well... it was a little disappointment for me that this wasn't the book I expected. As far as I read the preview of this book, it encouraged me to imagine the various styles of playing with good pieces. Since I wanted to know more about the other styles of playing, besides classical guitar which I play, I was determined to buy this book. (And, just trusted the big-name of the author). However, there's not deep enough study for each style, but they were just ""introduced"". Maybe, it's just impossible to cover various styles in one book, but I wish they were little more worth to try. So, don't expect to ""learn"" such styles of playing, you just get the feel of them..."
1,Made me feel like an idiot for buying,I usually trust this series and therefore did not spend 30 minutes reading in the store. Got it home and discovered that this is not a beginners book at all: the author spends 5 pages on the basics of playing and then jumps into 100 pages of advanced techniques and sheet music. I was totally lost immediately. I'm sure it's good reference for experienced players and music majors but not a beginner. I hope the store will take it back.
2,"Tries to cover all music, not for beginner.","This book absolutely will not teach you to play guitar.It goes over some music theory, and discusses different playing styles (blues, flamigo, etc.). It tries to cover way too much material for a small book.Interesting to browse, but not recommended."
3,Similar to others,"A big fan of the ""idiots"" guide to stuff - but this book was not much different than a typical guitar how to book, and assumed too much about the reader."
5,Idiots Guide for Guitar,Product received as described with disk intact. Am pleased with purchase and would buy again in future.
2,it really is for idiot's but not in a good way,"this book is is full of super basic information if you own a guitar and took 4 lessons you would be beyond this book. i expected it to go into more relevant playing styles but did not really happen. if you are an emo rocker want-to-be just picking up you very first guitar then by all means get this and sit alone strumming you little heart out, but if you are really trying to get beyond your fisher price my first guitar start some where else. it is not a bad book just very very slow moving and i would say that if if your guitar does not look like the one on the cover. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK. i would recommend it to my grand mother to please the shady-pines crew. i know she would find it her speed."
2,What beginner would choose not to use a pick?,This book is not for beginners. I've been playing guitar for about one year and am still taking professional lessons. I bought the book just to have as an extra source. The book starts off by having the player grow his fingernails so he can play with his fingers. What is that all about? FORGET THIS BOOK IF YOU PLAN TO USE A GUITAR PICK LIKE 99% OF ALL PLAYERS DO. I just don't understand the author's theory here.
1,less than 1 star,"If i could, i'd rate this review less than a star however the system does not let me. I sent out e-mails to find out what was up and where my book was over 2 weeks ago and i still don't have a respose or a book! So much for giving it out as a christmas gift...Thanks!"
2,This is not a book for beginners.,"It would be better to pick up a guitar and learn for yourself than to try to learn to play guitar following the error-filled pages of this manual. The examples and theory lessons are incorrect in places, and unless you are somewhat familiar with musical theory, you won't know which instructions are correct and which are not. This book could start you off with some handicaps if you are just starting to play guitar for the first time."
5,Great Teaching Tool!,"This book presents the ""how-to's"" of reasearch into a fun, adventure-filled activity for kids age 9-14. How many times have you heard, ""If I don't know how to spell it, how can I look it up in the dictionary?"" Take your middle school kids on a library research adventure, following the adventures of Tennessee Toledo, using the world almanac, world atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus. Your students will be inspired and challenged, as they uncover the clues and unravel the mystery. They won't even know they're learning!"
4,"A strong, broad overview","Powell's Web Design is an extensive and thorough overview that provides a lot of breadth at enough depth to be worthwhile. The book will probably occur differently depending on the reader's prior knowledge. For myself, it helped put certain pieces in place and gave me a stronger sense of how various items are related.While NOT an advanced text for someone wishing to gain expertise, the book is by no means superficial. What I found very worthwhile was Appendix A: Core Web Design Principles. Reflecting on these rules and suggestions was very valuable. Understanding each of them puts you well on your way to a strong grasp of web design.I don't consider the book a ""complete reference"" so much as a comprehensive presentation of web design at a level deeper than an introduction but short of advanced. A very worthwhile read for those in the middle that will add to their maturity in the subject."
4,Nice Desk Reference for any Web Designer,"A fundamental knowledge of HTML and familiarity with a web authoring tool such as Dreamweaver or FrontPage will significantly increase the value you derive from studying this book. For the beginning/aspiring Web Designer this book offers essential information for going professional and becoming recognized in the field of web design. Whatever your caliber is as a designer, the book is awesome to have as a desk reference. After you've finished studying this book, I recommend also studying ""Professional Web Site Design <from start to finish>"" by Anne-Marie Concepcion. This second book shows readers how to effectively manage a web design business!"
3,Comprehensive but common sense,"This book does not lack in details or volume. It is highly recommended for someone that is a beginner to novice in the website world. Don't expect it to teach you HTML or JavaScript. It concerns itself more with information architecture and GUI / design principles. For an experienced webmaster, it is common sense stuff that you already live by."
3,"Big on pages, and small in useful content.","I bought this book under the impression that it would be the ""Complete reference for web design"" and at the length of 901 pages thought it should do the trick. The trouble started when I realized the book was seriously lacking in examples of code. I have found myself on numerous occasions, unable to find simple things in this book.The author dislikes the use of popup's and talks down to you if you would like to know how to make one. He goes as far as leaving the proper way to make one, completely out of the book.This in my humble opinion is not the way to make a complete reference to web design. It's big on pages, and small in useful content."
2,Online resources are not available,"Too bad that the ""competent"" author of such a comprehensive book does not practice what he preaces. The online resources located at are mentioned throughout the entire book. Unfortunately they are non existent. (See items such as the templates mentioned on page 40). This diminishes considerably the effectiveness of the book, not to mention the credibility of the author. You will be better off buying a book that has all the resources available. Personally, I feel that I just wasted $40."
5,Just what you need to know about optics.,I feel most people think optics are so involved that they will trust a saleperson. This book was great reading as a learning tool for the basics of optics. I highly recommend it.
4,Jesse James revisited!,"A rollicking, fast paced, tongue-in-cheek crime thriller unfolds in an unusual Kansas farm setting. Improbable character twists add drama. A leading character turns out to be a direct descendant of the Frank and Jesse James family with totally unexpected consequences when faced with a modern day criminal organization. A number of clever plot twists and unforeseen developments make this novel a gratifying page turner."
1,Pitcher? it's definitely garbage worth pitching!,"STAY FAR AWAY! Don't buy it. Mine arrived and was obviously defective because the handle was only half welded on (the lower part of the handle was dangling in mid-air, unconnected to the pitcher itself). But even if it was not defective, it was apparent that the build quality is appalling, because the handle is held on by the weakest of spot welds.How hard is it to build a pitcher correctly?I've never returned anything to Amazon before, but it's definitely back to Amazon with this rubbish. STAY FAR AWAY!"
2,Pay attention to spout,"I did not realize the spouts on these pitchers could be different. I'm not happy with this pitcher because of the spout. I bought it for a coffee bar I manage and because the spout is very ""short"", liquids do not pour easily. There is always a mess all over the counter when this pitcher is used. Pay attention to the spouts when ordering!"
5,Love it:),"Nice quality and size. With proper care, should last forever! I recommend it to anyone, I bought it as a decoration for my bakers rack."
4,Four Star Review,"I was so confused to see Ludwig van Beethoven as the ""composer."" True, in this in this wonderful mess is a song that incorporates one of Ludwig's songs. Probably the fact that his last name starts with a ""B"" (early in the alphabet) makes it come out that way. Or just Rudy's legacy. Rudy was a great pitch man, so to speak, for his sound for his sound and his career. Rudoph Valentino changed his name to because of this C-mel sax player. By today's standards this collection is tinny but it captures the verve of that man and that era. Thank you one of the reviewers for making it clear why the title is confusing and thank you Amazon for a credit card that gives me free access to this treasure. I put my own spin on one of the Rudy tunes with my old Conn Cel-mel that I am starting to work with again. Life is great! rob"
5,Almost enough to get the job done.,"Hi all, I've been writing code for over 5 years now and work as a developer for a software company. I'm also MCAD Certified. We use VS.Net 2005 exclusively and the reviews that you will read below about this program sucking are not true. I believe the reason users may think this program sucks is because they don't know how to use it. It's just like anything else, if you don't know how to use the program you won't benefit from its features. Now one thing I will tell you is that when you want to create a Windows Service you WILL need the Professional version of VS.Net 2005 to do that. Other than that I have created atleast 25 web sites ranging from personal sites to enterprise e-commerce, numerous desktop apps that range from single managed apps to apps that use WIN32 API, ie old COM stuff, Class libraries, Server Controls and .Net Remoting objects. So unless you need to create Windows Services this is the package for you."
5,excellent service,they really made a good effort. I needed the software urgently and they respond immediately and I was able to have it on time.Thanks.
4,Reports could be improved,"When I loaded Visual Studio the SQL Server component did not load correctly - only the Configuration manager loaded - on reading the reports on the procedure I was informed that my computer was below the minimum hardware requirements, this despite me running a 2 GHz machine with 512 RAM and plenty of disc space.A little bit more granularity might help me locate the problem."
1,"Not Adequate, Not Ready, Not Usable","We've been waiting a long time for Studio 2005, and it's a very exciting release. Unfortunately, it's not ready for release. The package is unstable from the install onwards.I'm a .Net programmer, a C# early adapter, a long-time user of sophisticated programming tools and IDEs including earlier versions of MS Visual Studio. And I've been a beta tester for MS as well as other major software companys.This is beta-quality code, at best. Wait a while, as MS will undoubtedly get everything straightened out in time. OR, if you want to spend half a day installing a package that doesn't work right -- go for it."
2,What a Slug,"I bought this because I needed the standard version so I could create custom controls for VB.net.This software is a horrific resource hog. It runs so slow on my machine that it is almost unusable. (I am running a 1GHz machine with 392megs of RAM) It takes almost 5 minutes just to start the program and several minutes to load an existing project. I have also had problems with it when it finds a bug: you correct the bug and it will not let you back in to edit. You have to restart the program. Furthermore the documentation is garbage. It takes forever to search the MSDN help and then returns incomprehensible articles often that are not on the correct subject. Examples used are extremely complex instead of explaining things are a showcase for some MS programmer to show how smart he is. Furthermore if you think this is BASIC, think again. This language shares almost no relationship to the old VB6 or earlier visual basics. As far as Microsoft is concerned BASIC is dead."
2,Very confusing,"Have had several people read the directions, which in itself is a book, and none of us can figure out what to do. I keep passing it around to see if someone gets it. I disagree whole heartily with the age range. I think you maybe sent me the genius edition!"
4,FREE FORM PLEASURE,"DEFINTLY INTERESTING , SOMETHING TO RELAX TO MEDITATE, FREE FORM JAM STYLE, AGAIN USING THE UNIQUE SOUNDS THAT SET THEM APART FROM THE CONVENTIONAL...AMBIENT, SMOOTH DIGITAL TOUCHES, WHILE KEEPING AWAY FROM MESSY EXTREMETIES...GRAB IT"
5,cant wait to get off work to watch,service wasnt the fastest but hey came undamaged and new as i ordered!!!cant wait to watch when i get off work today..pay all my bills and i have entertainment to get me through.
1,sad imitation,this show is just another show to follow suit in the reality realm. the last 2 seasons of the l word were rushed and could have been done soooo much better and then they put out this show?!?!?! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!
3,Book review,The book was as described. For its age it was in very good condition. I am very happy with the value of this product.
2,Popular series but not our favorite,"You can't deny the kid appeal of this series. Despite their popularity my children enjoy them but don't clamor for the next volume as they do with some books.As an adult reader (and maybe as a child) you may find the dialogue drives you insane...which is what I find. There is only so much""Yeah,"" she said.""Okay,"" he said.that I can take in a book. And the treehouse books do it repeatedly. If you can deal with that you may really enjoy these--most children do."
5,Dinosaur Days With Jack and Annie,"Dinosaurs Before Dark was written by Mary Pope Osborne. The text copyright date is 1992. The book is found in most book stores.Jack and Annie found a magic tree house. They climbed in and it took them back to the time of the dinosaur. In the land of the dinosaurs they find friend, foe, and gold! Something gets in the way of Jack going home. To find out Jack's problem read the book!"
4,Simple for new readers,"These are the books that finally got my 8 year son, who'd been very unwilling to read by himself, into reading. He likes the different settings for each book (dinosaurs, pirates, wild west) and that they're fast paced. To an adult, the books are too simplistic, but they're just right for the new reader who's looking for adventure/action stories with a little bit of mystery tossed in for good measure."
2,A shame that the author did not show more concern about her craft,"I gave this book (and the whole series) two stars for providing an easy transition from picture books to chapter books.I did not give it more than two stars, though, because the books are sloppy and shallow, and their grammar is horrible. (Since I was reading the books to my son, I could at least make corrections on the fly.) The characters are not only flat stereotypes (scholarly, rational brother and his emotional, impulsive sister), but in the majority of the stories, they are almost completely passive. Things simply happen to them. There is little display of ingenuity or independent problem solving on the part of these two ""heroes"".It is too bad that the author did not show more concern about her craft. If she had, my son and I would probably still be reading her books. Instead, after getting our toes wet with the first few volumes, we quickly moved on to better material (namely, Dragon Slayers' Academy)."
2,I won't be buying any more in this series!,"I've been having such a good time reading ""Junie B. Jones"" to my daughter that I decided to branch out a bit. I picked this up thinking a series with over 20 books has got to be good, right? WRONG! The boy is a coldly logical ""scientist"" who scorns his sister's imagination. The girl is a touchy-feely dingbat who rushes up to a carnivorous Pteranadon because it looks nice. And of course, it must be intelligent too-- she can ""feel"" it!One reviewer referred to the girl as a good role-model. I am apalled. What the book said to me was that science and rationality is for boys, emotion is for girls, and it's okay to walk up to any strange beast (or person?) as long as it looks ""nice"". The science content is mediocre at best, the dialogue is lousy, and the story not very interesting. It IS a fun concept, and maybe it gets better in later books, but I don't intend to find out."
2,Creative Paraphrasing Needed,"It is exciting for my son to imagine two children flying off on wonderful adventures in a treehouse filled with books. Yes, the writing is painful to read but what 4-yr. old doesn't love dinosaurs, knights and pirates? I creatively paraphrase as I go along and sometimes omit entire sentences during storytime. It really annoys me that the author didn't do a better job but my son sits rapt with attention and asks a million questions. The Magic Treehouse books provide a good basis for further research, lively discussion and fodder for the imagination but again, I paraphrase. I would rate the age range more in the pre-K to Kindergarten.When he is ready to read chapter books on his own, I will steer him toward different authors. For now, he laughs when he tells me that no story sounds the same twice."
2,What it is not.,"Not terribly interesting, thought provoking, educational, intriguing or endearing. Children need some ""easy reads"" from time to time - sort of a palate clearer. This could work for that purpose. Or for reluctant readers who could get drawn into a series for continuity."
1,Dawson,This book sucks it is so babyish it was so fast bit medocer jshzhzjzjzbzjz. Zjs sjd dj xj hxxb dj jd
3,Kindle edition cost more?,"I want to give my daughter a kindle, and thought I could reduce the stacks of books she is acquiring. However, the kindle edition of these books are listed at $4.99, while the paperback is $4.49. Slam dunk. No Kindle, just buy the paper-back and then we can give them away after she is done with them."
4,A good start for very young readers,"I enjoyed this story and would recommend the reading age from about 5 to 7. The one thing I really liked about the story was the factual content (i.e. Jack searching in the book to find out a little about each dinosaur). It helps kids learn a little about what they are reading and then they can pursue that knowledge if they wish. I think for the age range this book is intended for, it's a great series that will get kids excited about the adventures of Jack and Annie and want to continue on reading."
5,the first dinosaurs understanding,In this book Dinosaurs Before Dark Jack and Annie go to the time of the dinosaurs and Jack finds the gold madalen! one of the four things he has to find to set morgan the librarion free from the spell that she is under!When they go to dinosaur land they see a huge t-rex and when he gose to open his mouth there was FEET hanging out of the his mouth and Jack and Annie were scared to death almost so they want to get out of the dinosaurs time before they got eaten! the t-rex was blocking the way to the tree house so that they could not leave!
1,bad,I do not like these books. I think that these books are only for 5 to 8 in ages. I did read them when I was 7 to 8.I also think that are to fake. I do like to read but I wouldrather read something else.That kind of book makes me bord.I will just say that FAKE is not my bag.
4,Fun for young readers,"I purchased this book to read to my 4 and 2 year olds, and they enjoyed it so much we have gone on to read the next 2 books in the series. It's a story about a brother and sister (just like my two, just older) and how a Magic Tree House transports them to the time of the dinosaurs because of the book they were looking at. I know that when they are old enough to read on their own they will enjoy reading it again. It's fun for a read out loud book for little ones and simple enough for beginner readers to handle the content on their own."
3,Magic tree house #1,This kindle book does not include text-to-speech as the previous magic tree house book I had purchased. It would be preferable if this information were more clear in the kindle book store.
4,The Magic Tree House #1,THE MAGIC TREE HOUSE #1 THIS IS A STORY ABOUT TWO KIDS WHO FIND A MAGIC TREE HOUSE. THEIR NAMES ARE JACK AND ANNIE. THEY COULD SEE THE TREE HOUSE BECAUSE ANNIE BELEVES IN MAGIC AND JACK LIKES BOOKS. THE MAGIC TREE HOUSE TAKES THEM TO LOTS OF COOL PLACES. I GIVE THIS BOOK A **** (4 STARS).
1,Bad,This book is way too short it took me about ten minutes to read this book. I would not recommend this book to anybody except babies. I would have rated this zero stars if it allowed me to. And buy melodic blessings by the edina parkour team on iTunes for $4.45
5,ANOTHER MAGIC TREE HOUSE BOOK READ INSTANTLY,"Another happy 7 year old reader on this one. Received and read on Christmas day, even with a new gameboy cartridge in the house. That should speak for itself. Very readable series for the age group."
2,One of the Best in a Mediocre Series,"Kids in the 5-7 range will probably love this series with its dependable repetition of formulas that my kids loved to say out with me when we got to the best part of the book: ""The wind blew harder ... The treehouse started to spin ... faster and faster ... then everything was still. Absolutely still."" The loyalty and friendship which bond brother Jack and sister Annie are also a refreshing break from sibling squabbles.On the other hand, it's discouraging to watch the heroes of these books visit far-off times and places and learn virtually nothing about the places they go to, because the author is so ignorant about science, history and the English language (gravity varies depending on whether you're in a building or not; ""thou"" is a plural pronoun; etc.). If you want your kids to learn anything from their readings, you'll have to delve a little deeper into the mass of children's literature than this trivial series."
4,good,I buy a lot of stories/books on CDs for my blind grandson. He likes this series. I thought it was fun and the concept imaginative.
4,Magic Tree House #1--Dinosaurs Before Dark,"My 7 year old grandson, who is really into dinosaurs as well as an avid reader, really enjoyed #1 in the Magic Tree House series, ""Dinosaurs Before Dark,"" as he read to me and I read to him. As a retired elementary teacher, I saw the book as a history lesson in disguise!!! In fact, he enjoyed it so much that we went on to read and enjoy the second book in the series."
3,this book,"it is not bad but i like the other books better in fact, its actuly the first book of magic tree house i read"
5,Negativland's best,"Fans of Negativland should find this disc their most enjoyable as well as their easiest to listen to. I personally think ""Happy Heroes"" should have received airplay as it is one of the most mainstream type of things these guys have ever done. ""A Most Successful Formula"" is, again in my humble estimation, one of their most ""musical"" collages. The entire disc is very funny, listenable, and takes direct aim at the uninvited corporate salesmen that invade our lives every day in so many forms."
5,Their 2nd greatest CD to date!,"This is truly a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it will probably be sued out of existence just as their U2 CD was sued out of exeistence. Too bad for us music lovers. Get this CD while you can!"
4,Musical doorway to suspended time,The music in this album brings an atmosphere of being in a time/space outside the rush of the daily grind.
5,"Excellent, touching story.","Like all Natalia Ginzberg's books, this one will not disappoint you. Its sad, but also moving and emotional. I read the Italian version and I'm sure the English version is just as compelling. The story is told entirely through letters between a mother and her estranged son, a very difficult relationship. Definately worth reading. She is my favorite Italian author."
5,Love it!!!,"When i was buying this high chair, i was a little concerned since i couldn't find any reviews for it. But i loved the idea of the finally usefull high chair and i bought it. Chair is easy to assemble, and the plastic parts look good, and are sturdy. I love taking of the chair (top part), and puting it somewhere more comfortable to feed my baby. The only thing that needs improving are the belts on the chair, they just don't snap on easy, but we got used to them."
4,"Love the high chair, hate the buckles",This high chair is great. it cleans up well and is a breeze to put together and it is really sturdy. first we bought a highchair at walmart and it was so cheapt that we took it back and then ordered this one online. the only bad thing about it is the buckles to b uckle them in. they are extremely hard to use...way too stiff. i have pinched my fingers numerous times where they actually bled. my daughter has also had her finger pinched in it...i almost think there should be a recall on these buckles for this exact reason. if it can make my finger bleed its way too dangerous for a baby.
5,Great High Chair!,"I got this for my four month old and he loves it! We use it even when he's not eating, since he loves sitting up high so he can see everything. The tray could be a little closer to him, but it's not too bad. You have to be careful to line up the tray just right, but it's easy enough to get the hang of it. Also, the snaps are kind of stiff. I've just starting leaving one side buckled and getting him out that way. This chair is so easy to put together. I love the fact that all you need is a quarter to twist the nuts in, rather than having to dig out a screwdriver. It's also really easy to fit into a car for weekend trips or holidays. I took it to my parents, and the chair fits inside the table, and all of that fits in the front seat, no problem! The chair is so light and doesn't take up a lot of space. The orange is pretty gender neutral, so I'll be able to save it and use it for my next child. I would definitely recommend this to other parents!"
1,Questionable company,"I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: ""this is our policy."""
1,not a good book for it's price.,"if this book was marked at $7 retail then I could say that one can buy and not lose money on this book, but for the price and the hype about this book, I only have one word....""Garbbage.""Very ill defined passive toned childhish kind of book. not worth the money..."
4,Classic Durang,"""The Vietnamization of New Jersey (An American Tragedy)"" is a genuinely funny play in the classic Christopher Durang style. Still, it is plagued by a problem I have noticed as prominent in his other works: Durang can't end his plays. In this one, the ending is strangely incompatible with the rest of the play and has a bad plot. Sadly, the same applies to nearly all his work I have read; ""Titanic,"" one of his more unsuccessful works, had all the characters change personas at the end and do very strange things, and ""'Dentity Crisis"" had a sudden change in the characters too. In fact, of all Durang's work that I have read or seen performed (a total of nine or ten), the only two plays which do not feature incoherent endings are ""Beyond Therapy"" and ""Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You,"" which are easily his best. The verdict? ""Vietnamization"" is a good play, with lots of humor and a hilarious analysis of America, but the poor climax brings down the total."
3,Enoyable read regardless of other reviews.,"I am an avid Austen fan and initially didn't download this book because of the reviews, relenting at the last minute... Yes, there is a lot of information about the political turmoil of the time but it sets the context of the book and some of the conversations and actions of many of the characters. She focused a lot of energy on particular characters and left out characters (all but name references) all together, but it was enjoyable none the less if you are truly engaged and enjoy the original story. Overall, I enjoyed it and (especially since I downloaded it for free) I thought it was worth a read."
2,It was ok but dragged in places,"The wedding is done and now Elizabeth Bennett and Mr.Darcy are now husband and wife. And as they make their home at Pemberley they will face many new things. Children are born and the have new neighbor England is changing. But though it all Lizzie and Darcy will face it together.""The Pemberley Chronicles"" is the first in a series of books by Rebecca Ann Collins and overall it was an okay book. I did thought that the author spent a lot of time social issues of the time period and not enough time on the characters. Also, I thought that there were a lot of characters and I did tend to track of them. Overall ""The Pemberley Chronicles"" was an ok book but die hard fans of ""Pride and Prejudice"" may not enjoy it."
2,so soupy!,"i started reading this book, since it was one of my book club selections, but i only got 30 pages in. it was just too soupy! it was basically and overly extended ""happily ever after"". there was no conflict (internal in any character or between characters), so it was way too MUSHY for me and i had to stop reading. three other girls in my book club didn't finish the book either. the only one that finished it, really enjoyed it. she said that she thought that this is how married life is (she just got married a couple of months ago). but for me, the ""i love you so much"" and ""oh, remember when""s just got to be monotonous."
3,It started out so romantic..... but then was devastating!,"This book started out so romantic with the love and passion Darcy and Lizzy have for one another as well as bringing in Jane and Bingley and the Gardiners. (The only true flaw is that Miss Austen herself says Mary Bennet marries but not in this series.) However I was silly to think they should have an entirely happy ending, I guess I was naive but if you feel the same way and you like the happily ever after, then do not read this book! Near the end a tragedy occurs that devastate several of the families, if not all. I cried for two days but then I read the second book The Women of Pemberly, which was not sad and very good and it made me feel as ease. That at least Lizzy and Darcy's love had withstood the trial and had grown. So if you do get this book I recommend the second book too. But I see no reason for the others after."
2,Barely tolerable enough to tempt me,"A tame, pleasant sequel that's suitable for younger readers who wish to spend more time with the Darcys. While many interesting characters are introduced, I simply could not distinguish them from one another. Familiar characters do not fare much better: they are uniformly pleasant, and we get just more bad behavior from the usual suspects. There's not a lot of action or surprises. While no glaring missteps with beloved characters and technically well-written, I would not recommend this."
1,Mind-numbingly boring,"This book was so hard to get through, I only stayed with it because I was on vacation and had nothing else to read and hated to waste the money I spent on it. It has practically no plot, everyone is perfect, and all the author does is invent more characters with ...and this they did this...and then they did that... She doesn't know how to write a novel.This went into the trash. I can't believe she's written more books."
3,After the weddings,"What happened to the Jane and Elizabeth Bennet and their families and friends after their marriages to Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley? Rebecca Collins does a good job in creating a continuation of which Jane Austin might have approved. Characters behave in a manner appropriate to the originals, and new characters fit into the landscape in believable ways. The curtain is carefully drawn before any indelicate scenes occur. Tragedies are a bit overdone, and implausible, but in general, well done. I'll look for the sequels."
1,So Bad,"This book is not only boring beyond belief, but so repetitive as to be a burden to finish. And the liberal politics which occupy 2/3 of it is complete clap-trap. Very disappointing. If this author loved and studied Jane Austen's works, and in particular Pride and Prejudice, she must have read it very differently than I did. Don't waste your time."
3,What a history lesson?,"Although this book was written well... I wanted more of Darcy and Elizabeth. This book had a lot of the history of England and was quite educational. I appreciated the length the author went to in writing the history into the book, but just didn't want that much! I like others, had wanted to jump ahead. This book at times didn't feel like the main characters were the Darcy's, but everyone else around them. Col. Fitzwilliam, The Bingley's, and the Gardeners, and all thier children play a huge roll in this book. The first 3/4 of the book takes a while to set the tone. The last 6-7 chapters are the greatest and are complete page turners. I know I would buy this again book despite the other reviews, only to have it in my P&P library."
4,A concept album that wanders,"This is their most overtly political album and one of my favorites. It's concise and funny, like ""Escape From Noise"", but the issues are more important. It's a mishmash of ""idea"" pieces, odd stories, and surreal songs that seem like inside jokes. Overall it's a good place to begin with this band. The social engagement keeps this from getting too self-indulgent."
5,Great Album,"Using lots of audio sampling and some tongue in cheek, this social commentary on society mixed with unconvential tunes is a great album. It is not traditional music but a collection of sampling with background tunes."
2,Very disappointed,"I am having the same experience that 603rd lgcn baps is having. I got the system a little over a month ago and I thought it was fantastic. The sound was amazing and I loved the 5 CD changer. Then about a week ago the system basically shut itself down and displayed an error message every time I tried to turn it on. It also emitted an earsplitting buzzing sound as well each time I tried to turn it on. I am returning it tomorrow. I could just get it fixed, but a system that breaks only a month after purchase is definitely not worth the hassle."
5,Still First Rate,"This is still one of the finest sets of the standard four symphonies of Robert Schumann, and it's not really out of date, since the playing of the Dresden orchestra is so excellent, the balances Sawallisch gets so clear, and the sound still so good that the music sounds as fresh and youthful as it really is. Recorded in the early 70s, this set has never been out of print, and EMI's engineering presents every note in warm but clean sound which still sounds great after forty years. The program notes are interesting, as well, and I recently realized when I compared my copy of Sawallisch's D Minor Symphony with the newer Zinman, that I prefer the Sawallisch by a nose. The others are close seconds, along with the great recordings of Szell, and we must still keep in mind the Gardiner set, but this one is still in the running."
3,Dull performances,"Sawallisch's Schumann gets a lot of critical praise, but to my ears this is an unexceptional set. He treats Schumann more like Haydn than the epitome of Romanticism that he really is, and the result is dispassionate, ordinary readings. Yes, Sawallisch manages to clear up Schumann's rather troublesome orchestration nicely, but there's more to interpreting this computer than that. Compare Sawallisch to Bernstein (Schumann: The 4 Symphonies) and you'll hear a conductor far more sympathetic to Schumann's idiom than here."
3,not the best,"Originally,many comments on this circle convinced me.However,after I finished listening,I don't think Sawallisch's Schumann can eclipse Bernstein's.Lack of enthusasim,it makes me feel a little boring.The outline of the brass is vague.And the string is so light that the the recording sounds apparent.And the defects in recording are found here and there.I recommend Bernstein's Schumann circle with Vienna Philhamonicinstead of Sawallisch's one."
3,New Viewpoint for Old Tale,"Hey, I suppose I'm always up for a new telling of an older tale and this one was one of the better retellings. Tragic - leaves me wondering if it was all just a big misunderstanding in the first tale. Warning about non-consensual scenes and just plain stuck up characters! The first tale was the best, but the after stories didn't interest me as much. I suppose the modern vampire tale was alright though."
3,Not a 'must-have',"This album, although it is the renowned ""Purple Tape"" that launched the Pixies' career, it is not an essential. Each track, other than Rock A My Soul, has been released previously, and the versions of each song found on this cd a fairly similar to the previously released versions.I'm not bashing the cd, because it is a good cd, there's just nothing really new on the album. I gave it 3 stars because it's not as good as the other pixies albums. If you have every other pixies cd, get this one only to complete your collection, but not so you can hear some exciting new material."
3,I love the Pixies but....,"Although interesting Pixies is far from essential. Short even by EP standards these recordings don't really shed light on what the Pixies created. It seems a cynical marketing department chance to cash in on old fans and those curious about the band that inspired so many modern rockers and punk bands.Pass on this and get any of the original studio releases, they will be much better choices.For completists only..."
4,Fundamental book on the Do-335,"This book is a pleasure to read, from various points of view:The written material are highly interesting telling about the entire environment in wich this awesome machine grew up during the WWII. The technical info is very complete too. The graphical is stunning, with lots of photos, exploded views, transparencies, etc. My only complain in the graphic content, is caused by the priority gave to the Dornier's original documents, wich are -obviously- written in german. That's itself OK, but it would be much better if they include the same paragraph translated into english, you lose a great time no knowing what is in (for example), the exploded view's references. This is the only fail y can tell from an otherwise excellent book. You'll enjoy it for sure!"
1,One size does not fit all,"I purchased this item with the intent of displaying a 1:48 scale airplane model. When received, I put it away in anticipation of completing the Revell F-15 Strike Eagle (Model 85-5511). Unfortunately, either the Revell company is wrong in its identification of this model as being 1:48 scale or the Imex company is wrong in identifying this display case as being ""suitable for for aircraft of 1:48 scale"". The aircraft I am building clearly exceeds the dimensions of the case by at least 3 inches.I am truly disappointed but I cannot hold the dealer responsible as it is the manufacturer who failed to use the verbiage ""Suitable for SOME aircraft of 1:48 scale"". I want to make sure that everyone is aware that this product falls ""short"" of its depicted use."
4,"Great replica buckle, but...","An ex-girlfriend gave me a similar buckle (this is probably a replica) for by birthday over 10 years ago. The original was made of a heavier material and had a curved ""hook"" (the piece that goes in the belt hole). The ""hook"" broke on my original, so I bought this one. It is a pretty good replica, but compared to the original, the design impressions aren't as defined, the material is lighter and the hook, although effective & functional is not curved.Over-all, I am quite satisfied - it just doesn't seem as substantial as the original!"
3,"Highly entertainin, allowing for pent up aggression to be released in an appropriate manner","This game is highly entertaining for children to release pent up aggression that they cannot otherwise do, for example, hitting a brother, or a sister, or torturing the family pet. while, some over sensitive former hippies, or the offspring of them, might find this game unacceptable, our child loves it. Thus, Whack away! It is a toy, people. Get a grip!"
3,Don't buy this for young kids!,"We had this game when we were little, and it was a waste of money! It was not fun at all and it just took up a-lot of room. My sister got this when she was fairly young and it hurt our fingers when we were not careful. The hammer could hit your fingers and it can hurt little fingers even more. The sound affects are beyond annoying! This game seems fun, but in the end we wish we have never purchased it!"
1,Not worth your money,"This dull game really isn't worth your money.All you do is try to hit some moles that constantly make annoying sounds.After a few seconds,the game gets boring and repetitive.Save your money and buy Monopoly instead."
2,3 yr old love it but...,"This was a birth day gift for my 3 yr old daughter. It has 3 options to play ""solo"", ""easy"" and ""hard"" (for advanced players). She loved the game! But after an hour of playing the ""easy"" option, it stopped playing!It did not fall and she did not ""wack"" it that hard (afterall the game is supposed to be sturdy). The only option that would play (after 4 new battery changes) was ""hard"". I'm so sad, I now have to send this gift back to Amazon and hopefully get another."
4,how lucky are we?,"Bought this at an outlet for $6 or 8 bucks. The name was vaguely familiar and liked the idea of an action game. We have had no problems for 9 months, still working great. The time element brings out the competative spirit (watch those fingers). My spouce and I play regularly and it has held up fine. It is still a fun break from too many educational toys, and still promotes speed and real focus. Our 4 and 6 year olds cannot play each other because the older one will bully the younger until she just stops. Like every other game, parental involvement is needed (such a pity so many find this a negative). Worth a try for a competative, energetic kid!"
2,Fun - but will suddenly stop,"This game was cute, and the kids did have fun, but after a few weeks, the game just stopped working. Changed the batteries, and still nothing.Disappointing.."
3,My child loves this,"I bought this for my 4 year old, and he adores it. It is noisey, and he gets to beat on the moles with a hammer. The game is loud, even on the quieter setting, and has yet to run out of batteries (he's now 5 years old). The hammers are plastic and very durable, he has beaten most of his action figures to death with the hammers. It is a great game if you want to improve hand & eye cordination, but can be complicated for small children. He gets excited and tries to bash all the moles, even when it's not his turn. If you like your children to play quietly this is NOT a game you should purchase. It does NOT have a silient mode, I wish it did. Overall, it is an ok purchse for me the adult, and a great one for my kids."
3,Oldie but goodie,"My grandkids love playing this silly retro-era game, although I try to get out of playing whenever possible. It's for 4 players, with 4 plastic hammers and 4 moles. You whack at your mole when it lights up and makes your ""special"" sound."
2,Disappointed in what could have been a neat toy......,"This toy stopped working in 2 days! Tried new batteries, didn't work. I've written Hasbro asking about returning it. Toy store wouldn't take it back, as I already threw out the box. Just seems to me that a toy intended for children to ""whack"" would be a bit more sturdy! My son was crushed when his birthday gift stopped working :("
2,"Not worth it overall, lots of other games to choose from","My son received this for a 4th birthday present and while the concept is cute, it's not that fun of a game. First of all the initial ""set up"" process takes time while the mole explains the sounds/rules etc. You can't play the game without listening to the instructions each time. Try getting a group of toddlers to resist hitting the mole's head when it lights up during the instruction phase! They don't want to wait! Also it doesn't really have any educational value. Not that everything must be a learning toy, but since Amazon gives the option to rate it, the only thing they might learn is remembering sounds by playing the advanced version, which I don't think most children who would play this would be able to do. Don't bother with this one. There are plenty of other games that are more fun!"
5,Fun for the whole family,"We love to have family game night...the only problem is the kids ages (2 & 5) and finding a game that we can all play together. This game is good for everyone. It's not the most educational game, but in my opinion it does help concentration and listening skills. We have more educational games but we can't all do them together. The other one we like is a kerplunk game that looks like a bee hive. We are pretty tough on this game too and have had no technical problems. It's durable."
2,The fun doesn't last,"Truthfully, this game is not what I assumed it to be when I bought it; the moles do not pop their heads out of the ground like the Whac-A-Mole games at the arcade, but rather, simply flash when you need to hit them.This was a reasonably fun game for our 2 1/2 year old for the first couple of weeks but he soon grew bored of it.The default setting is not terribly challenging, although it does have an hard mode where your only queue to hit the moles is via a sound, which unfortunately, as the game is either too hard to or too easy, seems to be targeted to a older child."
3,daycare/preschool users,"I thought it had a memory type game in it, and it doesn't, the interest lasted just a short while, before it ended up just a smash and bang game!"
2,Level of Excitement,"This game was fun for our three year old the first time or two we played it; however, he quickly lost interest and the game now sits on his game shelf getting passed over for other games."
5,excellent fun and durable too,"We've had this game for about a year and everyone in the family enjoys it. There are three play modes: solo, easy and hard; in Easy, a light and sound let you know your mole should be whacked, while in Hard mode, only your unique sound is the cue. Up to four can play and we have played this with many ages, from 3 to 63, and everyone has had a great time. Our game has had a lot of whacks and still works very well. Excellent value and lots of fun!"
5,Whac-A-Mole!,I brought Whac-A-Mole for my daughters 4th Birthday it is an excellent game and entains my daughter for hours on end!It is great fun to play with the rest of my family.I would highly recommend this toy to any parent its good fun and you can join in too!
3,Good old--fashioned fun.,"Bought this for my grandson without realizing he had been playing it at a friends house and was asking for it. The game is easy, fast paced and keeps them engaged. So far stands up to the play of two active kids. Lots of fun."
3,I'll chime in as well..,"I've had this unit installed since 2003 in my Mazdaspeed Protege. Every couple months the unit will stop functioning in the way described above. The face will open half way, like it is going to turn around and then just stop. You can't use the unit in this configuration and it must be reset. I've never had a hard failure that a simple reset didn't fix, but it does get annoying having to reprogram your stations every few months. Overall the system was amazing at it's time... If it weren't for this single flaw, I'd still be using it."
3,Extremely useful; reliability problems,"I have mixed feelings about this program, which I have used extensively in my one week of ownership. It is one of the most useful and freeing programs I've ever found. Suddenly, entering notes for lengthy research projects became a breeze. However, this program crashes constantly. Although I am able to recover the text after a crash, the dictation portion is lost -- and I am unable to execute the correction procedure necessary for the program's effectiveness and voice recognition accuracy. This program was designed for dictating letters and similar, brief documents. I have learned, now, to break up note-taking sessions into smaller documents. Once you get past a couple of pages of dictation, you risk crashing the program."
3,3.5 stars--Too obedient to old school,"Ms. Pickard is a good writer, with the wit to make domestic abuse/murder issues as funny/ironic as they can tastefully be. Reasonably funny, actually, but she does display the multifaceted tragedy of those situations as she goes.The biggest problem is that this book's characters and plot are developed as though it were a 1950s domestic comedy--her tone and character depth are like Diane Mott Davidson's [an author I like, whose characters somehow end up more winning and less stereotypic, via the extra hundred plus pages per novel she takes to develop things.] Both central and peripheral characters are too simple and unreflective. Pickard does considerably better in her more recent, and longer, The Whole Truth."
1,Item didn't arrive,Waited for 6 weeks. Book never arrived. Emails when unanswered. Had to use Amazon to get my money back.
1,Buy a new printer instead,"The original drum in my HL-1440 lasted 3+ years.I bought this DR400 replacement drum, and after a couple months it started streaking my paper.Bought ANOTHER new replacement drum in December. It is now March, and the ""drum"" light just came on, and I can't print anything. I estimate that I've printed MAYBE 700 pages on this newest drum.What a piece of junk! I'll buy a whole new laser printer, and it will cost less than I've spent on these drums in the last 6 months!"
1,This is a recycled Drum unit: lasts only 100 pages,"Don't buy this product. This is just a recycled Drum unit, and won't last. If a real NEW drum unit lasts 20,000 pages and costs $200, then for $20 this drum should last at least 1000 pages, but it don't. Only about 100 pages.Don't waste your money.What's even more fishy is that the seller is changing names. I originally bought this drum from TONERIZE for $28, and its a bust. Tried again from CHAR's Enterprises for $58 and a NEW drum, but, much to my surprise, when I tried to link my prior order to Tonerize to leave this review, the item links back to here and my new order from Char's. Clearly something fishy going on. I intend to return the new drum as soon as it arrives. Going down to the Staples to buy a REAL NEW DRUM unit."
2,Disappointed,"I love the music of Verdi, and La Traviata is a favourite. I'd have thought the wonderfully flowing melodies (not to mention this very melodramatic story) would make tailor-made for ballet. It was neither. What a wasted opportunity."
3,Dissapointing after the first volume,"The first two books of this series were excellent. I enjoyed them because of the unique writing style, and the grand scale of the plot. The third book is not at all terrible, but the fourth I found quite hard to get through. It is far too confusing, and the ending is terrible. A dissapointment after the first books."
3,learning lessons about courage,"The author provides a clever and cohesive organization of fundamental ideas, based on the premise that life is for learning. The theme is ultimately unsatisfying, however, because she fails to come to grips with why we should care about learning. Learning for the sake of learning is quite pointless. But the author cannot summon the courage to follow her thesis to its natural conclusion: that there is a loving Creator who intends for us to learn and sustains us in the process. Euphemisms like ""spiritual DNA"" illustrate the lesson that this author has apparently yet to learn: that when we are afraid to speak out of fear that we will offend the sensibilities of others, we are left with nothing important to say. Scott Peck begins with much the same view about life as a laboratory for learning, but he has the courage to credit God with the design. In contrast to his work, this is The Road More Travelled. Too bad."
2,Advertising You Pay For,"While a small number of good points are made, the author fails to expand upon them. There is nothing terribly profound or ""enlightening"" in this book, but mostly an exploration of what many would consider ""conventional wisdom"". More than anything else, the book seems to have been used as a platform from which to pitch her company's seminars to a larger audience.The writing style also leaves much to be desired. It almost seems as though the same monotonous template had been used for each of the ""lessons""."
1,Where's the Originality?,"It must be said that Ms. Scott's book is not an original concept but rather a supportive commentary of an anonymous quote which has been popular in the new age community. If you do a search on her first rule, ""you will receive a body"", on Google you will get numerous results on websites that almost word for word list the same rules and supportive material as she lists in her book. She certainly did not break much of sweat researching this or any other spin-off versions of her book. Do you really want to be supporting her efforts (or lack thereof) with your hard earned money? If you are truly looking for enlightenment, which is what she's selling, you can get it for free. If you're looking for freedom, try just talking to God. Jesus came to break the rules... why would we want to make more?"
2,Pop Psychology,Pop (pap) psychology: possibly helpful for someone who has never read a self-help book
2,a credo for secular humanism,"Certainly the book contains some valid principles, or else it would not be as popular as it is. However, how a book can claim to teach spiritual lessons, but never even acknowledge God? It is humanistic philosophy that espouses that we alone can better ourselves. A close look around us shows that left to ourselves, we have made a mess of things. We MUST rely on Someone higher than ourselves. Also the advice the book offers is quite simplistic, not very deep. Very easy reading."
4,"If There Is a Healthy Self-Help Book, This Is The One","Many of the concepts she puts forth in the book are time-tested and clearly communicated. Her agenda appears to be to help readers find what is true for themselves by using the 'rules' and their explanations, rather than to dictate black and white do's and don'ts. Her examples demonstrate the underlying challenges to living a successful life and she offers healthy choices for behavior and attitude. She writes from compassion rather than ego, from a desire to reach out, rather than to preach."
5,"Decievingly simple, but EXTREMELY powerful.","A friend recommended this book, and I must say that I was skeptical at first, because the design makes it looks like a nice little ""coffee table"" book. I have read over 100 self-help books and feel extremely qualified to rate this book in an educated way.This has easily become one of the best books on the subject.I have a habit of highlighting important material so that when I want to go back I can re-read things, and this book is now a MESS of highlights.I went and read all of the 1 and 2 star ratings, and I frankly can't believe them. All of those people want a book with THEIR rules for life in it, and judged the book on what they wanted it to say. That's what little minds do.This book is wonderful, and I hope I come across more with such depth.This is going on my top list- I really think this is a phenomenal book, and I hope the author gets it out to everyone."
2,Not ready for Prime Time,"(Based on Microsoft Subscription Final Release Product. Tested December 2005)Lots of nifty features, but unfortunately it needs a few more months of development before it will really be stable. They say a serious update will be coming out sometime in mid 2006. Hopefully the problems with hangups, corrupted project files, and the maddeningly slow text input will be fixed then, so we can start to do some serious programming with this potentially very exciting product."
4,Great Leap Forward,"I've been using the product for several months now for both web and winforms development, professional and personal. I run it on a three year old Dell laptop, with an Athlon 4 processor. It has occasionally been slow, especially when I was working on a half million line winforms application I'd ported from VB6. That said, I had far fewer speed problems than some collegues, my laptop having 1 Gb RAM, and them only 500Mb.I find this version of Visual Studio lacks many of the bugs and glitches of 2003, and I really like the enhancements to ASP.NET development such as Master Pages, Generics, and the ability to use Atlas/AJAX components as web controls.All in all this is a fantastic step forward for the developer, just make sure you have as much RAM as possible. A Service Pack in the near future would probably be helpful too."
5,The Bee Tree by Patricia Polacco,"What a great book about the adventure of reading! Our family loves Patricia Polacco books! Everytime we read one of Patricia's books, we learn something new about her family. You won't be disappointed with 'The Bee Tree'"
3,The Bee Tree,"Patricia Polacco does an excellent job in creating the masterpiece, The Bee Tree. She goes into bubbly detail of the adventurous journey that the characters take to find...the bee tree!Mary Ellen is tired of reading books indoors. Her Grandfather offers to go on a ""bee tree hunt"". They capture a few bees in a jar, and set one free. -That is when the hunt begins. As they run after the bee, others follow along to enjoy the tradition. After setting all of the bees free and loosing them, they actually find the tree.The adventure was told in great detail and kept me reading on. The story had a good, united town of people that had fun together. In this book, my favorite character would have to be Grampa. Grampa told Mary Ellen that books can be exciting also. Grandpa also liked to have fun and enjoy life."
5,Polacco's usual superb work is evident here,"Patricia Polacco is, to my mind, one of the finest children's book authors working today. Her mind is endlessly inventive and she manages to convey important truths and vital life lessons without ever once descending into preachiness or condescencion.Such is the case with ""The Bee Tree."" Polacco combines her usual rollicking, active illustrations with text that rambles and gamboles about all over the place. Mary Ellen is a little girl who's bored by reading and just wants to be outside running around. Her grandfather, through the course of a shaggy-dog-story-chase about hunting for honey, manages to convey to her the limitless things she can learn via books. The lesson is clear without being pedantic."
1,Ashkii and His Grandfather - Ashkii y el Abuelo,"This has got to be one of the STUPIDEST ""I wanna write an indian book"" books to have come along this century. El Abuelo isn't even a Navajo phrase. El Abuelo is SPANISH for the grandfather. ""Y"" is Spanish for and - also not a Navajo word. Please woman - don't try to be Indian - you just embarass yourself in the Native American community."
3,It's Okay,"I never used much of it, so I don't know if it works or not.. In hindsight, I should have carefully considered before buying this product"
3,Would have been 5 stars if it had been edited well and on non-glossy paper,"Great book, but I actually like the earlier edition better. I have the latest edition, but was disappointed with the many errors in the book and on the CD that accompanies the book. The Index has numerous errors as topics are not listed on the pages stated in the index. The CD also has numerous errors as the pictures dont coincide with the chapters in the book even though they are supposed to.And finally the photos are printed on glossy paper making the details of the photos hard to see under reading light. The older edition used non glossy paper which made the pictures much easier to see. If they fix these two problems (indexing error and paper quality) then this book will receive a 5 rating from me."
4,Ophthalmology Illustrated,"Useful for the ophthalmologist in training, but Spalton's atlas is more complete and up-to-date. Consider buying the atlas instead."
1,still waiting to receive book,"Ordered this book over one month ago (Oct 22). Took 2 weeks to leave US (Nov 7). It still hasn't arrived in Australia. Amazon has requested for me to do a review of this book, but don't have it yet to review!"
1,"Inadequate, full of inaccuracies","The book should prepare you to get UP TO 60% score on your Series 7 exam.The author cannot even properly explain the simplest 101 concepts, such as what a ""Stop Limit Order"" is or how index options work.There are plenty of inaccuracies, vague explanations and knowledge gaps.After having read the book twice, I took a couple serious practice tests (not from this book) only to realize that I have not learned nearly enough to pass the exam effortlessly.Buying this book was a waste of money and reading it - a waste of time."
3,"Lots of Potential, but not all that memorable","I listened to this CD before I bought it, and I was really excited. It sounded like a mix of Fear Factory and Crossbreed. The more I play it...the more it kinda bores me. The songs seem a little long, so the punch is lost. To be honest, I haven't really given it more than 5 spins...but from what I can tell, it's got some great riffs and electronic sounds...yet it just doesn't stay with you. If you love FF, then maybe check them out...but don't rush out and spend $14 hoping for the next best thing."
5,Why don't more people know Sybreed?,"I don't think this album isn't quite as good as Anteres, but it is still a good, solid album. I especially recommend ""Bioactive"", ""Take the Red Pill"", and ""ReEvolution""."
4,What everyone else said,"I heard about this band through Amazon.com and decided to pick it up based on what the amazon users said about it. You guys pretty much nailed this group head on. If you like Mnemic, Raunchy, Soilwork, Fear Factory or In Flames, this band is worth a listen. Of the bands mentioned, I think they sound the most like Mnemic.They have a sound that really has a lot of potential. They are a little rough around the edges but overall they have a good concept. I really can't wait to see what this group does next. With the right producer, they could really make a name for themselves. For now, pick up this CD used like I did for $6.00."
3,this band needs to get better,The sound is very original but they need make it better with better production if they get that than they will be big. But this album is very hard to listen to because there is barely any substance just potential to get better.
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!,"I canNOT stop listening to this album. I never skip a song when listening to this CD; even the single mixes are good!!! I hate new hardcore screams, but the way Ben blends it with singing is just amazing. I actually got a promo copy of the CD alone, then found the retail CD, packaging and all, and picked that up as well. Recommended tracks??? ALL!!!"
3,"Note: This is a set of DVDs, not a book!","Although it is listed under 'books', and it says that it is hardcover, this is not a book, this is a set of DVDs, containing some of the information from the book.I bought this thinking it was the actual book and was sadly mistaken."
5,"Awesome band, even better live","Element 101 is a very good band with good lyrics. I saw them twice this summer at Cornerstone 2000, and they put on a very good show. The only things is some of there songs sound the same, but they are still good. Nohing is better than a female frontman in a band. She has a great voice and the band is very good. I highly recommend this cd."
2,from alien to zomie nightmare this book has it all,"The overlook film encylopedia:horror, not to be confused with the horror at the overlook hotel HERE'S JONNY and here's my review.The Overlook is quiet simply the only horror movie review/reference guide you will ever need I have tried them all no realy just ask my librarain I mean just go into your local library and ask for a book on say russ meyer or or the spaltter films of the 1980's and see what kind of looks you get.but I not only digress I ramble .to sum up don't miss ths book becuse it is a must have for horror movie fans"
2,"Comprehensive, but seriously flawed...","In terms of exhaustiveness, this book is probably second to none. Not only does it survey almost every American horror movie ever made, it contains a good lot on international films, especially italian giallos. A new edition of this 1994 book would be most welcome.However, the authors of this book make the serious mistake of revealing key plot details of most movies, thus ruining the viewing experience of the unwary viewer. This is not how reviews ought to be written. So please do not read the review from this book before viewing the movie, it will ruin it for you!!!"
5,Ash?,"A really great set of pieces. Sakamoto is in a broken 19th century mode here, playing fragments of phrases which recall the piano music of Debussy and Poulenc (if you've heard his BTTB, you'll know he can go the whole way with this style of composition), a very evocative and sophisticated aesthetic. Fennesz provides a sympathetic background to the piano, eerie and moody, more Venice than Endless Summer.I have no idea why Pitchfork would refer to Music For Airports but I do think that The Pearl by Eno and Harold Budd is a comparison. Like that record, this is music which really plumbs the sonorities of the piano.In response to the reviewer above, while Vrioon is pretty awesome, I would say Revep is a bit of a snooze and lacking in inspiration.Nice cover too."
4,"The production's improvable,but the songs...","This is for me one of the best albums in the border between electronic music and pop music,before Bjork,and before many others (I don't say that this album should be better,but only different).You must regard that in 1989,album's edition year,this scene was not the big that nowadays is... There is at least three or four unforgettable songs in this album;moreover,you should listen to the lyrics:the compromise with their enviroment,politically but not only politically... It's not a concept album,but the concept is in the album... For people who think art had to be in the streets..."
4,Comfortable but ...,"Indeed it is comfortable. Made in Japan.Con:1. I ordered the XL. It is still a bit tight for me as a medium guy. Cannot image how can large guy survive the so called largest size XL...2. I expected $19.9 is for a pair of knee sleeves. However, it is actually one. I am not sure if I should buy another one, since the total cost of a pair of knee sleeves will be $40... A bit expensive though.However, for ladies or ""slim"" guys and don't worry about the budget, I will recommend it."
2,Roll down,did not like Cozy knee sleeve as it rolls down the knee. It was listed as not rlling down the knee..
1,Didn't stay in place,"I only had this knee brace on for a few minutes. As soon as I sat down, it rolled down from the top."
5,"Disturbing, brilliant","This is a story of two people who set out to change japan (and to some extent, the world) by unwaveringly sticking to their principles, using both Japanese politics and its underworld.The plot details the intricate maneuverings of the two; there is little violence. Their opponents are not weak (mentally, in power, or in integrity), and their friends sometimes carry liabilities. The characters are as believable as those in any of the best western novels (the plot is far more western than eastern); this seems more like a novel that just happened to be drafted in graphic form.Unfortunately, westerners should be cautioned that manga often contains graphic depictions of rape, which is usually treated in a humorous light. This book should be docked for that, but I'll leave it be.The only other manga I've read is Crying Freeman, so I'm not very biased towards manga."
2,Having trouble,"I am having a hard time getting into this book. She writes very well, but I think over my head. But I admit I am not very far into the book, yet."
4,Good Insight Into Mind of Illiterate Character,"There's not much mystery in this mystery because the author tells us what's gonna happen and who does it. But she still manages to present a compelling read and, although you know how it's going to turn out, the tension keeps building throughout. The main character can't read and this is an enormous part of the book. The author takes us into the mind of the illiterate, illustrating the tricks they use to hide their handicap and the embarassment that accompanies them wherever they go. Rendell is a wonderful writer and her talents are well on display in this short, but riveting psychological novel."
3,Me ha gustado,"Muy bien escrito, como es habitual en la autora. Excelente análisis de caracteres y buen ritmo. No obstante conocer el desenlace desde la primera página, se lee todo el con interés."
5,Another Rendall Knockout,"Ruth Rendall never disappoints. This police procedural, with wonderful, careful, exacting acing and the never-off key Adam Daiglish, is a page-turner, and predictably satisfying."
3,Not an airplane book,"This is clearly a well-written book, but at the risk of being politically incorrect, I did not enjoy it. Perhaps it should not be read on an airplane, but I could not get into the book. This is not a light-reading mystery novel, so buyer beware."
5,"Chilling, mesmerizing and brilliant...","I have read everything Rendell has written and A Judgement In Stone is her best novel in my view. The book is flawlessly constructed. The characters are mesmerizing and their voices, mannerisms, habits and dialogue are amazingly unique. I literally would stop while reading to contemplate how the author was able to jump so completely into a character that was entirely different from the one in the previous chapter. Many reputable authors are capable of bringing their characters to life but, but when you read Rendell you realize she surpasses them completely. She is like the Meryl Streep or Philip Seymour Hoffman of literature. She can get into anyone. She can be anyone. Her talent is absolutely staggering."
4,she's good.,"i generally do not read, and hardly ever am impressed with genre fiction of any ilk, but i've heard so much about ruth rendell that i thought i'd give this a try, and low and behold it was very very good. top drawer entertainment with credible and creepy characterization. i will absolutely be buying and reading more from this prolific author. great crime writing!"
4,Another fine psychological thriller by the English master,"Once again, Rendell portrays what seems to others a quite ordinary woman as the violent psychopath that circumstances encourage. While Rendell's kernel idea, that a person's inability to read, the limits of the world thus caused, the shame it brings her, the desperate need to hide her inability, defines her life and her final fate, is a bit of a stretch, she is completely convincing in developing it in a step-by-step progression to what then seems inevitable. The main character's very ordinariness is what makes the story so horrible. It is a provocative idea, skillfully executed."
2,Chance,"With all the positive reviews it is with hesitation that I comment. I found the book boring. Rendell tells us umteen hundred times that the protagonist's illiteracy was the cause of her personality defects. I didn't buy it. However, I think the worst part in the story was the fact that a reporter bought the tape recorder and listened to the tape. Come on. There are so many good mystery writers that don't rely on this kind of chance."
5,Rendell at her best,"Im a huge fan of Ruth Rendell and still think this is one of her best books. Rendell is a consistently engaging writer with a sharp eye for social commentary, but I find she tends to drag in the longer books. Thats why I prefer shorter pieces like this one or ""A Guilty Thing Surprised"" (from the Inspector Wexford series). After reading check out the great 1995 film adaptation by Claude Chabrol: La Ceremonie, with excellent performances by Isabelle Huppert and Sandrine Bonnaire."
5,Engaging book,This book is simply fascinating and is written very well!!! It is something that everyone could enjoy.
1,Terrible,The book is bad. Real bad. He makes his students buy it for his class because that is the only way he can sell it. He takes the most broad stories and turns them into a theory of flying that makes no sense. Just a pointless book about nothing that can NOT help anyone in any aspect of life.
4,Soothes and entertains!,"Our 4 year-old grandson loves this feeder, hypnotized by the day-long comings and goings of our neighborhood hummingbirds! Entertaining and nurturing -- a great addition to your porch or deck."
2,Wasps LOVE this one,From the reviews I really thought this feeder would feed hummingbirds and not attract bees. Not so - it attracted yellow jackets and wasps - crawling all over it and chasing hummingbirds away. How do people keep those off? I am very allergic to yellow jackets so instead of hummingbird feeder I ended up with a death trap in my yard. Had to take them down and get a different type. Other than that it is a very sturdy and well made feeder.
2,nice try but Best 1 leaks,"Best-1 feeders leak. We bought the 32oz, but they all seem to have the same problem with the mold for the bottom 2 pieces. After a few weeks, it deforms, and then leaks around every rib, because they don't use a gasket . .we solved the problem by coating one of the pieces with a bit of petroleum jelly, but it is a lot of extra hassle, and could easily have been solved with a better mold for the bottom pieces. After I called them twice, (and they did not return my calls) they said not to leave them in the afternoon sun, because it heats the air in the bottle and floods the bottom, making it leak. They said that was in their instructions, too, but I read them three times to be sure, and that isn't in there.It IS easy to clean and attracts lots of birds"
4,My Favorite feeder however we did a modifcation ...,"We love this feeder. We have 3 and they are easy to clean. The birds just love them however I found some disturbing images on the Internet where the beaks of the hummers can get stuck in the holes. I had my husband take a drill bit and redrill the holes at an angle. The we ""chipped off"" the extra plastic on the underside of the hole plate. The design is much better with the holes at an angle."
2,pitiful,"This book started out wonderfully. the first two characters to be introduced were interesting and complex, the world was well-put together, The author threw in an interesting supernatural twist....and then it flopped. It was as though she simply couldn't get from point a to point b and keep things intersting. It became WAY too much about sex and WAY too much about Kalista. She was already egotistical and the story in the book just encouraged her. Everything revolved around Kalista. Blich.This author has promising world-building skills but needs to work on her motivations, make her plots more complicated and keep her sex drive out of her books. Glad I read this one at the library."
2,sex plus fantasy,"I had no idea that LUNA was a Harlequin imprint. If I had, I would've had other expectations. Now, I like a well-written romance novel, but this really was not. I bought it expecting a fantasy novel, not wild sex in a thin wrapping of a fantasy world. This book started out quite promisingly, with some interesting world-building. Then it went downhill from there with two-dimensional characters, who seemed to be either purely good or purely evil. The sex scenes were overblown and without any fun or tenderness. Bleah. The ending was rushed and contrived (and not a surprise at all). The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the interesting socities that the author has devised. I won't buy the sequel."
2,Trashy,"This book looked so good from the back and the cover. It even started out good. I like the setting and the ideas behind it. But then it goes completely downhill. There is no plot. Just wasted pages filled with trash. The charcters meander around hopelessly arguing with each other and worse. Supposedly, they're all on a plot to destroy a demon, but they only get going in about the last fifty pages. And then it's all easy. All that whining and the demon is destroyed in about a page. Sorry if I'm ruining it for anyone, but I'm advising you not to waste your time with this book anyways."
2,stupid thing started out GREAT,"I loved the first 70 or so pages of this book. It was well paced action with enough exposition to reveal the actual setting of the book. The feelings of the protagonist were apparent - she's a magic user who's just channeled a magic not seen in millenia.But it falls to crap rapidly.There's a group of baddies after the heroes... typical, cloak and dagger ignoramuses. But the biggest problem for me is the inability of any character to be intimite without being sexually intimite. If I wanted to read soft porn, I'd go to the erotica section. This had WAY too much of that going on.As to others who say this is a romance? There's no romance there. Just sex.(*)>"
2,Love/Hate...,"Love/Hate??? I loved the ""idea"" of the book...and hated that I didn't really like it...It started slow... got better...got a little better, then it just couldn't keep my attention.I think what hurt this book for me was I never connected with any of the characters. They all seemed really bored with no personalities. I normally enjoy series like these (C.L. Wilson; just to name one)but not this time."
4,I liked it,"I wondered why such incredible poor reviews, so after reading this book, I scanned back to the reviews to recall what the big deal was and realized immediately why. If you are looking for a dramatic novel with ubber writing style than you will not be interested in this novel. As far as being erotica or soft porn, all I got to say to that is HA!! These people have NO CLUE. Try reading some of Llaurel K. Hamilton's latest novels and then talk about porn and poor writing skills.I thought it was a light romance with action. It kept me entertained and reading for two straight days until I finished it. Granted, there was dialogue that made me frown and laugh out loud at the corniness. Still, it was entertainment and it's what most people read books for."
3,The middle was its down fall,"The start and end of this book showed promise, it's just too bad that the middle is what is supposed to be good in a book. The protagonist started the book out showing leardership potential but as the story progressed everything I had admired her character for slowly disappeared until only her flaws were put on display continueously by the author. The love that was so apparent and important in the beginning of the novel slowly disintegrated into a haze of confusion and lust that was completely unncessary for the plot progression. Only towards the very end of the novel after Gail had played the desperate card used for wayward female protagonists -preganacy- did the story some-what improve, as the protagonist began to regain lost ground and again show admirable qualities.If you can't take a book that you have to wait out in order to get to the good stuff, don't get this one. It's okay but not anything more than average, even if it does have the potential for a great book."
5,The Lawmen,"Just about when I thought heroes were going to die, they found a way to survive with, ""yea i can see that happening"". it was great!"
4,Good Western,"Enjoyable Western that encorporates race relations with a classic Western story line. Quick paced writing keeps you engrossed and turning pages, enjoyed this read."
3,Politics in the old west,A well written book with a long list of characters. Just a little bit far fetched but a fun and quick read. Broomall has a flare for the western.
4,Enjoyable,"The hero seems rather unlikely, but narrative grabs your interest... some of plot twists seem unlikely.. this is good escape story, leave your everyday troubles behind.. leaves you wanting to know more about his life..."
4,lawmen,"I really enjoyed the reading of this book, it was an easy read and easy to follow with the plot. It kept me interested enough to finish in one day. Of course it was not too long to do so. I would recommend reading this book and others by this author"
3,You get what you pay for...,"I found The Lawmen to be entertaining enough, but I can't say that the writing was all that good. As with many of these kindle specials ($.99 or less) there were frequently editing errors (in this book, you can often find ""die"" when ""the"" should have been used) but for the low price I can't complain too much."
1,The Lawmen,"I have not read this book, I think my wife or mother-in-law got this book, So here are the remaining words for this summission."
3,The Lawman,Not bad kind of interesting twist in the middle and the end of the story. Does keep you interested in the story.
3,A western with some new tist.,This book was a fair read. Light but kept moving. Kept me interested.Like most western has to be taken with a grain of salt.
3,Spoiled By Profanity,"Good plot and good story. However, the unnecessary profanity took away from the value of the book. The struggle between the marshal and his deputy to attempt to be at odds with each other while forming an eventual friendship was an interesting addition to the overall plot."
1,Reverend Sean Michaels,"what is this guy serious....he thinks he is jesus christ...he is too slow and hairy...very hairy, no one wants to see his hairy chest, that is the only thing i can think of that makes this pic worth buying..the t shirt covers up is jungle he has growing on his chest..his receding hairline isnt helping his image...he should take his chest hair and start implanting it on his head...sean michaels is a wimp...and i can out bench him...amen"
2,plain plane,Ok the beginning was alright .. but interest was soon depleted and video turned off after 15-20 miutes waste of $.
1,Too noisy even when I set the volume to low,I can't stand more than 5 minutes of this video and I don't want to mess up my kids ears. I wish I can return it.
3,Toddler loved it but got bored with parts of it.,"I purchased this DVD for my toddler son who loves airplanes. He loves to watch the movie, but tends to get bored and distracted when the extended ""flying"" scenes come on. These scenes are waaaaay too long in my opinion. It's like 5-6 minutes straight of watching the same plane fly back and forth across the screen. I wish there was more talking and explanation of details about the planes, what they're used for, etc. but it's pretty much just video clips of airplanes flying back and forth with a little animated airplane introducing each plane. Overall, I would recommend it for someone who would love to just sit at watch airplanes take off and land for hours."
3,not to bad,The video was not to bad for the most part. I am a pilot and my 5yr old son is obsesed with airplanes but this video was alittle boring to keep his attention on it. There is many of the same clips they show over and over and its just very slow going and boring! Some other videos out there are much better for kids and more active to keep their attention.
2,none-too-inspired nerdiness,"I'm a Negativland fan, but this album and ""Sex Dirt"" (a surprisingly boring CD about sex, cleaning products and repetition, repetition, repetition) convinced to not just indiscriminately purchase all the Over The Edge discs.Listening to these recordings, I felt sorry for the young Weatherman's family, trying to have their holiday while he plays them tapes of themselves, asks them geeky questions (""Would you say it's... Over The Edge?"") and makes a general nuisance of himself.I mean, I did stuff at least this nerdy as a kid... but I can't imagine releasing it.P.S. I too hate Tom Hanks, though this album never reminded me of him."
1,Piece of crap,"This DVD player was cheap, and it shows. It only works sporadically. We go months on end where discs won't read. Also, despite using S-video cord and the three RCA plugs into our TV, the audio is often ""scratchy"" and sounds like crap. It also likes to put subtitles on when you've specifically told it not to. We've ended up playing movies and videos on our computer instead. This is a horrible product. Never again."
1,DVD FOR CHEAP stuff. DH&AS,"When I ordered this DVD system, I thought, hey, cool a player for so less(...). I was a little wrong. When I tried putting in a DVD, sometimes, it would say,""NO DISK"". I was outraged. When it did work, there would be this blinding red light throughout the movie. This DVD player didn't even read ""Star Wars""!!!! I hate this thing. It's junk!(...)"
5,Superb action packed book,"Another great book by Tim Green. With each book, Green matures as an author. In American Outrage, he juxtaposes a son looking for his real birth mother with organized crime and a behind the scene look into a tabloid news show. From the first page to the last, this book is packed with action and leaves the reader rotting for the heroes to succeed in their mission. If you are a fan of Grisham, DeMille, Patterson and other Green books, you will love this one. Definitely one of his best works."
3,Slow and plodding but readable,"I never know which Tim Green I'll get when I pick up one of his books. Unfortunately, this one turned out to be slow and plodding with one of the main characters being an obnoxious and demanding thirteen year old. Glad I picked it up at the used book store and it did occupy a couple of days at the beach. He's done much better work so hopefully first time readers won't judge him by this somewhat lackluster attempt."
2,Essential?..Not really..,"As the title says, Essential? It really isn't his strongest compositions we have here on this CD. Well, Light Sky sure is essential, but not all of the songs on this disc were found on the other official releases.The only other songs that could be called essential would be 'Energetic' and 'Sun' even though they are not the real highlights from the other releases he made. But despite this, there are quite a few interesting songs, but nothing really remarkable that touches your soul like ""Mirror of Motions"" & ""Inside Out"" does/did.Grab it if you want some diffrent sounding stuff from what Lambert is capable to produce. But if you have his other releases then don't bother picking this one up.There are too few songs on this disc, and to call it essential seems a bit of a joke to me, as there are so many good songs missing that IS Essential!.But then I started to think, either this release is called Essential or this really is Lambert's private ""Essential"" stuff? Who knows...."
2,More interesting for appendix than battle description,The author basically takes 200 pages to justly criticize Hooker and the rest of the Union command without really added much to the strategic or tactical discussion of the battle though he does put a great emphasis on the importance of the terrain that the battle was fought over. As another reviewer mentioned the appendix is full interesting post war letters by the participants.
2,It's difficult to read on my iPad,The story is fine but it's practically impossible to read the small print on my iPad. I was VERY disappointed and would return it if I could.
3,Cute Christmas Picture Book,"I can't give it more than 3 stars, because there are so many Berenstain books. I'm glad to have it in my Christmas picture book collection."
3,Not good read on the Kindle,Pictures are not big enough on the kindle fire. I thought this child's book would be more like the book than it was. Disappointed.
5,Great book!,Berenstain Bears never disappoint! He loved this book and loved the stickers. He is a big fan of the Berenstain Bears books and their cartoon...this was a perfect addition to his collection!
5,a good book about caring,"This book is a good book about caring, especially during the Christmas season. At first Sister wants to receive many presents, but latter realizes that Christmas is about giving. it deals with Santa Bear and even wonders how he does such magical things. This book answers these questions in a way children can understand."
4,The Berenstain Bears Meet Santa Bear,"I gave this book four stars because it is a great book for children dealing with questions about Santa Claus. Papa Bear answers all these questions with a simple answer, ""Christmas is such a special time of year that very special, almost magical things can happen. And the most magical thing of all is Santa Bear."""
5,A life cut too short!,"What a tragedy that Lipatti lived only 33 years. This interpretation, like all the other Lipatti recordings I have heard, is magnificent. I cry each time I listen to the allegro vivace... There is certainly no finer, more nuanced interpretation of Schumann's only piano concerto, and it is unlikely that anything comprable will arise in the near future."
1,Not for wide width feet,I bought these shoes thinking they were a less expensive but good quality alternative to Merrell shoes. I was wrong. Both shoes tore at the seams the first week I wore them. I have wide feet but I have never ripped open a week old pair of leather shoes. Stick with Merrells which are of superior strength and workmanship.
1,"Boring, boring, boring...","I thought this tape would have some real situations with real people, but the only thing it has is an english teacher talking about some business scenarios. I got bored after 10 minutes of video. I wish I could have my money back."
1,zzzzzz...not for students with any frontal lobe activity!,"Very disappointing. The level of explanation is far too demanding for the student target level. I was hoping to use this in my class to supplement a textbook I am using (in a Japanese university), but I just don`t see any possible way students would get any positive learning from this video (and teaching in Japan for eight years, I`ve had to learn to be resourceful!!)@Definitely not worth the money paid."
4,fascinating stuff,"A strange,interesting film that has an atmosphere quite unlike any other movie I can think of.Peter O'Toole is great as the director who'll stop at nothing to get what he wants.If you fancy watching something that is very different and a bit more challenging than usual check this one out.The anamorphic image looks fantastic and the DTS track is brilliant for a film of this age."
4,Anyone for a stunt?,"After FREEBIE AND THE BEAN, this wacked out moviemaking concoction seemed like the right move for Richard Rush, and it is astonishing entertainment. That isn't to say that it will suit every taste, but those who like to figure out fantasy movies may like the film (but for the love of films, buy it on DVD). Rated R, with profanity, nudity, simulated sex, and gore."
4,My favorite movie,"The Stunt Man is, viewing after viewing, my favorite movie. Not only are Peter O'Toole and Steve Railsback Oscar-worthy in tailor-made roles, Barbara Hershey probably was better only in Woody Allen's ""Hannah."" Above all, the screenplay crackles. And on DVD, it looks better than I've ever seen it. Images are sharper, more vivid and widescreen.The disc is a must-see."
4,"BRAINS, BRAWN, BOFFO","This maniacally funny, whiplash-paced action movie offers a much-needed lesson to contemporary film studios: intelligence and action are not mutually exclusive high concepts. The story of a paranoid Vietnam Vet who stumbles onto the set of a WWI movie while fleeing the police, The Stunt Man manages to work compelling ideas about identity, control, and chaos versus order into a whiz-bang story packed with laughs, raunchy innuendo and kangaroo cookies."
2,Don't Be Misled by the Hype...It's barely watchable!,"Don't be misled by the hype surrounding this movie... it may have become a cult film, but contrary to all the glowing reviews, I found it barely watchable!Steve Railsback seems to be sleepwalking through the movie, he can barely act, and slurrs his lines routinely... the excellent Barbara Herschey is hopelessly miscast as a flighty star, and only the superb Peter O'Toole saves this movie from being a total waste of time (and even so, he hams it up a bit too much.)The script, though imaginative, is filled with ridiculous turns and silly contrivances (example: in a crucial beginning turn, the original stunt man first stops to give Cameron a ride, then he kicks him out of the car, and turns around to roll over him. Why? What? How? This crucial turn is never explained further.)Get this DVD if you are a super fan of Peter O'Toole, otherwise don't waste your time!"
1,A poor investment,"This review is based partially on ignorance as, with 45 minutes remaining, I stopped watching this film. But, through these eyes, there was nothing that could have redeemed this film.Peter O'Toole was the only bright spot in this film and I felt embarrassed for him - a Shakespearian heavyweight surrounded by a cast fit for nothing better than daytime soap operas. (Although I have enjoyed Alex Rocco as 'Roger Myers Jr.' in the Simpsons.)And there's no defending Steve Railsback's performance; while many saw his Cameron struggling with the director's mania, all I could see was a hack struggling to convey a range of emotions far beyond him. (Were he truly worth his salt, would his post-Stunt Man filmography include such classics as 'Armed and Dangerous', 'Alligator II: The Mutation', 'Nukie' and 'Barb Wire'?)In short, to have sat through the last 45 minutes, any 'payoff' would have been like given a dime back from my dollar."
3,Clever!,"This is a clever movie with a lot of potential, but it doesn't seem to use this potential to the fullest. The only attraction here is the magnetic peformance of Peter O'Toole, who is in one of his best roles."
3,"delightful premise with some excellent moments, but ...","A fun premise from the pre-CGI days of film-making.Thirty-some years later ... still entertaining.O'Toole is remarkable, providing both nuance and bravado.Worth the price of purchase just to see him.Hershey gives a good performance.Railsback is occasionally convincing, but too often just WAY over the top.Many really nicely done scenes, but more than a couple should have been lefton the editing room floor, or at least trimmed.Technically, the DVD is an adequate transfer. No complaints."
5,The second disk is a delightful documentary,I was surprised to find a second disk containing a delightful documentary. Unfortunately I went out and bought the documentary at the same time I ordered this DVD.
5,Cult Classic,The Stunt Man features Peter O'toole as a megalomaniac director exploiting an unsavory character portrayed by Steve Railsback. You get a glimpse of the art of stunts and the director's callous attitude towards stuntmen. The director is the star of a war epic that has little to do with reality. His skewered vision of war and his approach towards directing his epic go leaps and bounds beyond reality. This film has a fine cast of characters that give some gravitas towards the story. It is a thoroughly enjoyable romp as criminal turns into a vehicle for cinema. The director and stuntman can't agree on who is the star of this picture. The tension is palpable as the stuntman faces increasing danger. In the end they live to see another day.
3,It's the Hotel!,"This movie should be in everyone's library because, if I remember correctly, it shows the Hotel Coronado better that ""Some Like It Hot"" and in color. I'm suprised that none of the other reviewers mentioned the location which, to me, makes the whole movie wonderful. Great acting also, especially for O'Toole and Railsback fans. Are there many Railsback fans? Where did he go?"
2,Bad Cult Classic,"A cheesy movie. Characters are shallow and underdeveloped. Stunts and editing both were amateurish. The only redeeming quality was that Peter O'Toole was as crazy as ever. It may be a cult classic, but is a poorly made film."
1,Slams the sensibilities,"I walked out on THE STUNT MAN (in 1982) following a scene in which one of O'Toole's actresses is portraying an old woman who is getting her kicks from a swinging toy that depicts a bear/human coupling.I don't consider myself a prude (I love Kubrick's CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which outraged audiences when it came out), but Rush's undisguised contempt for his audience came across clearly. I took it personally.This movie is for people who have a masochistic streak, and want to be beaten up in the figurative sense.No wonder Rush hasn't made many movies in the last couple of decades; movies like THE STUNT MAN make you feel like you've been run over by a semi and dragged a few hundred yards."
3,Falls short of anything memorable.,"I just decided to review this anime. Oh crap I can't remember the names of the characters...................Now that I've gotten the DVD off my rack here it goes. Yufa and Roan travel the country having adventures. They are well meaning kids so they attract some companions. They travel around the country with their companions having adventures. Whoopie!It's not that this anime is terrible but it's not really good either. Some of the episodes have some cool stuff in them, but some are really lame. The production quality of this series is very good though. What this needs is better character development. If it had that it would have great potential. Just like Record of Lodoss War. That is what they should have used as a goal when they made this anime. I guess they didn't watch that one. If you can get it for under $5 then you might as well try it out. If not save your money."
5,"Great quality product, poor series","I have given this show 5 stars as I found everything about its quality perfect. Arriving still in shrink wrap I eagerly tore the plastic off and placed it into the player with bright eyes. It wasn't long before I regretted my decision, yet I pushed through every awful episode, only every now and then to be excited to not feel annoyed by the character development. If you are a fan of the online game this is based off then I recommend the purchase. If you are a collector af anime then I recommend this purchase. If you like quality packaging I recommend this product. If you want to be entertained then shop elsewhere."
5,Dope Rollers!,"Dont pay any attention to that review above, he obviously knows nothing of the RAW drum n bass sound. This cd was my first taste of D n B, and though it did not click with my ear right way it eventually caught on and I was hooked. This album has furiously deep basslines, some jump up, a hip hop hop edge, flawless mixes (no surprise from Andy C), a dark, yet refined and upbeat overall style. Its very very very rare to hear this kind of D n B spun live, or even produced for that matter, so if you like the new stuff see what was going back in the early 90's. This album does not dissapoint. - ..."
1,Don't Bother,Lights Out is credited to Bernie Torme and Paul DiAnno. I am a huge DiAnno fan and purchased this disc just for that song but upon hearing it I would be willing to bet that is not him singing. If it is he does one heck of a job sounding absolutely nothing like himself. I personally do not think it's him. Sounds just like the track on the Only UFO Can Rock Me tribute by Lea Hart and DiAnno didn't sing on that. I didn't bother listening to the rest of this disc as it is just another attempt to cash in on what little notariety there is left in the B list hard rock artists from the 80's.
4,That worked,"This arrived on time, well packed, first quality, and still had the sticker on it (it was indicated as new) and no flaws or scratches. The price was a bit higher than I had seen previously, but I was happy to find this piece since it is a discontinued item, so I'm OK with that. I will be shopping with them again."
3,"interesting mixture of early techstep, trip-hop and ambient","d'cruze has been around in the hardcore and jungle scenes for years. You can find some of his early work on the *cheesy* moonshine speed limit discs - you know, the fast-paced, sped-up vocals of early hardcore. This album, representing his first solo effort, is much better. My favcorite songs are ""free format"", ""come back"", and ""jazz dance"". I only gave the album 3 stars (wish there was a 3 1/2) due to slow parts in various songs - the beat will be kickin' and then suddenly everything will fade and leave you waiting for more action. This is NOT good for jungle. Some of the songs are kinda boring too - such as freedom. However, if you'd like a few good songs that represent well the early formations of techstep, then pick this up."
1,Fine authentic instruments crushed by Soloists,"As with his recording of Dido, Pearlman's instruments may be authentic, but he instructs or allows his soloists to belt out their lines with all the tact of opera in the full throes of Wagner. For those who swoon at the sound of the full throttled, warbling operatic voice, this is the recording for you, otherwise, stay far, far away.The voices entirely overpower any sense of ensemble -- which is to say, the ""authentic instruments"" are thoroughly dominated by the soloists.Besides that, these performances really add nothing new. They are conventional in every sense of the word."
3,"Yeah, not so good.","I'll give it some points for good recorded sound, but the performance really isn't what I was looking for. Some of the soloists aren't bad, but one at least (in the Bach exsultavit movement) sounds just amateurish. Not to mention a one oboe line where the player is essentially inaudible except for the dissonant note in the melody, making it sound like a really bad mistake. I'll stick with the Gardiner recording for now."
1,"Maybe OK for business, bad for home use","I bought one of these, and then found out there are several 'gotchas' for home use. * You get multiple mailboxes, but can only access 1 from each handset * After the answering machine picks up, there's no way to answer the phone, other than using the corded phone (at the console). * Battery life seemed poor"
2,Close but not perfect,"While I don't know of a better phone, it still is not perfect.Main problems:1. Difficult to know which handset to transfer calls to - important since you can not join an existing conversation.2. No quick dial numbers on base.3. No Router for inbound fax calls. (seimens feature).4. Had to warranty two handsets. Customer Service was difficult to reach and get replacements. One replacemnet was clearly defective. (don't buy refurbished IMHO)5. No dial by name on voice mail menuI wish there was a great solution."
1,Worst PHONE ever!!!!,"I purchased this phone in May 2004 - I have had nothing but problems with the unit and handsets. Panasonic states the base unit most be situated in a room with out a computer or 9 feet away from the closest one in order to not get garbly staticy reception on the handsets - wonder what office doesn't have a computer near a phone?? Low and behold you move the base unit away from the computers and the handsets still are garbled. Panasonic now states to reset the base unit and handset - i have to do this 5-6 times a day, while trying to talk to customers. And that still doesn't work all the time!!Terrible System!! - Panasonic's warranty (I bought 3 yr extended) only covers giving me another model - I ship my base unit out to them, which leaves me with no phone system in the meantime. My recommendation - Stay away, far away from this phone system!!!"
4,Great value,Great value for the money. Very fast shipment. It was very easy to install. I would highly recommend this switch.
3,Quick guide for shopping without having to use the main book,The Sugar Busters book is a comprehensive book but the shoppers guide keeps you from having to sift thru all of the pages of the big book. It is a very handy book to have when shopping for the correct foods.
2,Not too helpful,"Most of the shopping recommendations are for food that have low sugar noted in the ingredients, which seems like a good general guideline but not too helpful in a ""shopper's guide"". Also noted are - you guessed it - ""Sugar Busters"" brand foods where applicable.Except to bring in extra royalties for the authors, there is no reason for this to be a separate book. It really should be a supplement to the Sugar Buster's book itself."
3,"Informative, but need to read the book.","I believe it highlights the danger foods, prior to this, we believed these were truely beneficial and healthful. I agree that portions should be added, but as long as it's withing the 3000 caloric, suggested intake, do the math. What do you expect for $3.19?????"
5,Guide to healthy eating,For a person who is a type 2 diabetic this book is a Bible of what to eat. It lists the foods that you should eat for a low glycemic diet that will help to lose weight and stay healthy. This has to be a new lifestyle diet in order to lose weight and keep it off.
3,"Informative in more than one area, but could have elaborated","This bood gave a good basic outlook on what to buy and what not to buy, it was also informative in regarding food labels and their meanings. The only thing that I think could have been better is a more indepth look on how certain foods and their ingrediants interact in positive and negative ways."
5,"""Deep and agressive drum and bass""","That's what the back of the CD says, and in this case you can judge a book (or CD) by it's cover because Dieselboy delievers one of the hardest and most consistent drum & bass mixes I have ever heard. Though I'm mostly a fan progressive trance, happy hardcore etc. this CD really drew me in and kept me captivated right up until the end. The whole mix is great, and if you need any proof on how good this CD is try downloading ""Mode One"" by IQ Collective (song 2 on the album) then try telling me you don't want to pick this up."
4,Great pocket reference,"The C++ Pocket Reference is designed for C or Java developers who occasionally program in C++ and need a syntax reminder. Not designed as a tutorial or provide lengthy instruction on the subject, this book is great for a one paragraph explanation on a particular topic.I found this to be a very useful and easy to follow book. It starts out with the basics of writing a C++ program (processor directives, data types) and slowly moves into more complicated aspects of this language (like templates and memory management).I would highly recommend this as a reference book if you find yourself occasionally doing some programming in C++."
3,Please update for C++11,"This pocket guide is decent for C++03, but it's 2012. I know C++ is huge, but the awesome new features of C++11 deserve to be documented. I'll buy the new pocket guide once an updated version comes out."
5,Quite good.,"Sure, it doesn't cover the standard library much. I also don't suggest trying to use it as an introduction to programming in C++, unless you're experienced in C or another object-oriented language such as Java. However, this really covers the essence of C++, despite being a bit technical and confusing for beginners. I suggest you use a separate resource for coverage of the standard library, but this is cheap and effective. Q.E.D. (Yep, I felt like sneaking in a mathematical proof that this is good.)"
4,C++ Pocket Reference,"I am studying computer programming ... so this book is extremely helpful, handy and easy to carry around."
2,not what I thought,"I'm only half way thru the book, as it lost my interest, I purchased it thinking that it was a story of a guy rescueing dogs, but as of yet, nothing, just poems, and short stories. not satisfied."
5,Illustrations and Poetry to Enrapture You!,"What a superior book! The spirit reaching writings of Jim Willis combined with the exemplary artwork of Christine Head will engrave your heart.I especially love: ""I Loved You Best"" and ""Before I Die"". Both pieces moved me on many levels.Christine Head captures the special nuances of each subject; introducing you to the uniqueness of each individual. No cookie cutter ""breed standard"" illustrations here!I recommend this book not only for yourself but also for sharing with others."
1,Really and animal lover? I think not!,"August 18, 2005 - FORWARD TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- Humane officers raided a home in Forward Township Thursday. Officers say they responded after neighbors complained of the stench coming from the residence on Mentor Road. When they arrived on the scene, they found an animal house -- but this one had a twist. Officers found dozens of dogs, cats, ferrets, and birds living in deplorable conditions. But they also found something else. One of the people who lived in the residence was Jim Willis, author of inspirational animal books, such as ""Pieces of My Heart -- Writings Inspired By Animals and Nature,"" ""The Animals' Savior,"" and ""The Basset Chronicles."" The owner of the home, Erin Schmidt, has been charged with running an illegal kennel on the property. Animals found in the home were taken to Animal Friends."
5,"Bless the Beasts, and Jim Willis","Pieces of My Heart is one of those rare books that I will never part with. This is one that I will pull off the shelf often to read again and again. Every person that does any sort of animal rescue can relate to ""How Could You?"" I had the pleasure of sharing my home with a tabby cat for almost 20 years, and Jim's ""Beloved of Bast"" touched me deeply. On one page, I'm laughing reading ""'If' For Dogs,"" and a few pages later, I'm crying at ""I Loved You Best."" Our small organization had the pleasure of using Mr. Willis' book as a fundraiser and we did exceptionally well. This is a book that sells itself. One only has to open a few pages, read a few poems, and you know you must have it for your own. Animal shelters and rescue organizations will do well spreading the word about Jim Willis."
3,An interesting read BUT questionable impact on my bottom lin,"I recently bought this book. It has an intriging title and most profits do come from money management or as Van Tharp says it ""position sizing"". I have the Balzara book and Ryan Jones book and am basically using a modified fixed ratio method similar to rayn jones but with some improvements (I think !). The Gehm book made some interesting points but really did not help me get to that next level. I am going tpo re-read it and will come back with additonal comments. One think is clear that the sequence of previous winners and losses have very little do with future winners and losers. An anti-martingale method is the best overall methodology but which variation should you trade ? Optimal f BY mAthe Whiz Ralph Vince cannot be traded due to the hefty drawdown and use of older data to come up with the betting fraction.So what to do ? what to do ?"
1,"""For everything there is a season.""","Okay I really like this movie, a lot. Micah was my favorite leader. BUT This dvd SUCKS...... I agree with another reviewer this HAD to be a pirate version or something. The sound is horrible.... I had to have my tv all the way up to hear it, menu had six choices. It was just terrible version ALSO my box came broken. What a disappointment for such a good movie. So buyer beware."
3,movie doesn't play on newer dvd player I have,"Movie doesn't play on one of my dvd players and it's a newer onethat will play all kinds of disc ,but plays on my computer and other dvd player,I don't know why it doesn't play on the one it plays other movies that willn't play on my other ones,But plays fine on the ones it will play on."
1,Deliver product is NOT usable due to mfg errors.,"Of all the ""Children of the corn"" DVD's I've purchased, this is the only one that was not usable from the get-go.When the DVD tries to load, the 'normal' load process does not complete. A fractured image of a round image disk appears. There is no way to work around the problem. The ""Children of the corn II"" DVD is totally useless. It seems to be an error in the duplication process that produced the DVD.I have not yet found a methodology of contacting the vendor.Dave G."
1,fantastic sequel. Terrible DVD quality,"I really enjoyed this movie alot. What a shame I had to pay $31.00 for this awful quality DVD. Luckily, I found out in advance that there was going to be a new released dvd version of this movie for 2011. I was lucky enough to get half my money back from this terrible DVD, and used the money to buy the newly released version for only $6.99 shipped. The 2011 version is much better, clearer, brighter, and more colorful. It also has scenes that were cut from the Top Ten Media release. I really feel sorry for the people that still have the Top Ten Media release. They'll never be able to sell it now, especially since the new 2011 DVD is really cheap, and way better quality. If they are lucky enough to sell it, they will just get pennies, and not even get close to what they paid for it. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! Buy the 2011 official DVD release!!"
4,Much better than the first!!,"I thought C.O.T.C 2 was much better than the first. The first,at least in my opinion, was kind of bland. This one had more action in it. Actually,I saw the sequel before I saw the first one,LOL. Anyway,I'd recommend this one to any horror film fanatic."
2,Children of the Corn II ~ Terence Knox,Children of the Corn II~ Terence Knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage. The special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst. The acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production. The gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to Holly Upstairs acting school to write such junk. And to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me.
4,New broom Lois,"Lois Meade is a heroine to be taken with pinches of salt. Her home-grown detecting skills and sharp tongue meld nicely with her managerial skills. Not a lady to be ignored, as Hunter would tell us. I always look forward to more Lois."
1,Fear on Friday,I have read the Monday thru Thursday books and they are just the greatest. I love Lois Meade. Ann Purser brings out all of the everyday to day goings on in a family in England. I have never been to England but this gives me an idea what it is like in a typical small town. The wrting is very good and keeps you turning the pages and after reading them all you find yourself waiting for the next book to come out. Because it deals with a whole family and their problems I recomend it for teenagers to read.
5,Great gift!,"I bought this as a gift for my Mother a few years ago...she loved it! To this day it is still one of her favorite mugs. She loves that it's a larger mug, so it can hold more coffee and she doesn't have to refill it while busy at work on the computer. She does hand-wash it to avoid having the gold rim wear off, and the inside is stained from the coffee...but overall has held up beautifully. I'm thinking of buying another!"
3,Loads of potential....but falls far short!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Martin Scorcese must have poor taste in movies. In fact, most of his suck, so I shoulda known better. Anyway, this film takes a subject that is very much worth making a film about, has some great shots in it, but overall, there's NO story whatsoever. Felt like an 84-minute commercial for Feed the Children. Not very moving or very educational. I think the folks that consider this a ""top 10"" are just ""feel-gooders,"" who rated the movie more on the subject matter than the actual film itself. You want a better movie that also shows you some of the cultural in that region, see Hotel Rwanda, or even Endurance. Much better."
3,"Tiny Tiny, but you have to Expect Tiny","Italian charms are rather standard, so you can already guess about how big it's going to be. I love Klimpt and his fascination for redheads, but the detail is going to be rather lost on the face. I love it because of the artist and that it was given as a gift for my collection of charms. Obviously, you'll know what it is, but the details in the gold are not going to stand out."
2,not recommended,"I got this phone mostly for the brand name reputation of durability and for the optional headset. No problem there.However, the phone lags behind the others in the house when a call comes in and the sound quality of the handset sound terrible. As far as caller ID, I cannot comment. I do not subscribe to that service."
1,2-5-8 keys no work,"Could not dial calls as buttons 2,5, & 8 were inoperative. Also it did not ring for first three or four times and answering machine kicked in before I could pick up handset."
5,very good,I thought this product was great I had no problems with it. I like the Caller ID. The sound is shocking it is so good you should buy this product a great price for what you are getting.
5,GREAT,"Gloria Bosman is one of the most unique artists to come out of South Africa since the likes of Pops Mohammed, Hugh Masakela, and Abdullah Ibrahim. To our American ears, she seems to straddle multiple styles - somewhere in between jazz and r & b (not in a smooth jazz way). The sound is a percussive, at times harsh, but ultimately satisfying and rewarding one. Well worth it."
5,The Green Pastures - Where is the soundtrack,"Having seen this movie on tv when I was 14 years old, I never came to forget it. I've been very lucky finding it here at Amazon and I'm now hoping for this movie to appear on DVD, hopefully with the complete soundtrack featuring The Hall Johnson Choir.The film really touched me."
5,"Uplifting, innocent, filled with simple imagination.",I watched this movie as a child every time it came on tv. It was usually a family affair to sit and watch in awe with the other children and adults in our extended family.
5,I absolutely loved this movie!,I first saw this movie over fifty years ago on our little black and white tv. I was three years old and I loved it! I was fascinated by God and the angels with their flapping wings and cigars. My daughter found it for me years ago on video tape but I was afraid that wouldn't last and I wanted to keep it for my grandchildren to enjoy. I'm so glad to find the DVD!
2,Green Patures VHS tape,Even though my VCR has auto tracking on it .. The video could not be viewed at all with out skipping and having lines run throught the picture.
4,A Historical Classic,"I purchased this movie recently after reading all the reviews. It's very important to view this film with an open mind. Despite it being stereotypical, I tried to watch it with the mind of a child during that era and how he/she would depict God and Heaven. As a little girl, we were taught that everyone was made in the image of God -- and individuals would view God according to their ethnicity.Like LeVar Burton, I also found it a little difficult to watch. However, it has made such an impact in the history of film. If you have little children, it would be best to explain why the movie was made this way, and why the actors portrayed the characters in that manner. Other than that, the simplistic telling of the bibilical stories (in the ears and mind of a child) hasn't lost the important message in the translation. I think it is a keeper."
2,Green Pastures,I was not satisfied with this copy of dvd. It started with them talking and it took almost 4-5 minutes to see why. I had to go back and select play movie several times. It should not start with complimentary. So I will not order from that vendor again. The other two that I previously ordered were fine.
3,"""The Green Pastures"" etc.","I wasn't interested in ""The Green Pastures"", I wanted the historically significant short with Sammy Davis jnr and Ethel Waters and the item with the Nicholas Brothers in the other film. They were worth the price of the disc. I'm not Alexander Wall."
5,A True Revisit to the South in the 30's !,"I keep watching this film over & over again. It displays some of the very best cinematography in Black & White film making, I have ever seen.The film encompasses; Drama, comedy, visualizations & tremendous conversation of the old time south. The feeling of watching the all African - American cast, in a true southern depiction & context, is compelling to me. This is the time before the media introduced a rediculous control over what we, as Americans, can watch & enjoy as main stream filming.I would love to see this & other classics of it's time being replayed on todays television a lot more frequently. To me, todays black film makers are to reluctant to create films of life, in much lesser, simpleminded & wholesome environment. I recommend for all ages,to be a "" must see "" motion picture."
5,Delightful!!,"I had this movie years ago on VHS and literally wore it out! It is delightful on many levels. This movie is a must-see regardless of age, gender, race, etc. It is one of the very first all-black movies ever produced.Although it is in black and white, it delivers the biblical creation story in a highly colorful and original way. You will SMILE BIG when you watch this film. A good, decent, heartwarming and humorous movie like nothing you have ever seen. Way ahead of it's time! Invite some friends over, pop some popcorn and be ready for a great time!!!"
4,youth revisited,It was a pleasure te see again the film that awakened many good memories. Quality good! Dutch subtitles would have made a 5star quality judgement.viszcher
5,Green Pastures,Green Pastures is one of my all time favorite movies and I thought that with all the PC flooding our lives these days that it would have been banned long ago. But we are still able to enjoy the simple humor characteristic of those times. Bravo Amazon!
2,Company lacks customer service,"The bicycle is okay for basic riding. The company, Kent International, is terrible to work with. As in another review, we had a problem with the bicycle, and still, 7 months later, have gotten no help from them. I would not buy another Kent International bike for their lack of customer service. They are not concerned with you after you buy the bicycle."
2,Too expensive for what it's really worth,"My son got this bike for Christmas 2 years ago, within the 2 years he hardly ever road it until this year. The front brake locked up on him and the ball bearing retainers in the sproket bent and now he can't peddle it. I ordered the ball bearing retainers, but I don't recommend this bike because I thnk they put the cheapest parts in it and the bike is dangerous."
4,"A booger bear to put together, with no instructions, but bike is great if you can get it put together","A booger bear to put together, with no instructions, but bike is great if you can get it put together"
5,Perfect for my son,"Purchased for an 11-year-old boy. The bike is really sharp looking and seems pretty sturdy. We've got two feet of snow on the ground, so it'll be awhile before he's able to ride it, but he's pretty excited. My husband is NOT mechanically inclined, and the bike was very easy to put together. Would recommend."
4,map marimba is awesome live,"listened to a live performance of them in Providence, RI and they are really good. If you are into any kind of ethnomusic, map marimba is for you. Why 4 stars ? their music is more visual and it may be a little difficult to appreciate when hearing for the first time. So either watch them live or give them some time and it should be fun"
1,are you stupid,"this, is the most retarted sword that ive ever seen, if i was to fight some one with swords(wich i have) it wouldent last long, as soon as we would clash the sword would break off the handle because swords need to go into the handle and not screwing the blade on, if you dont know that then buy a broad sword or somthing and stop playing with japanese swords"
1,Don't Bother With The Paperback!,"If you are interested, even a little, with the pictures, do not buy the paperback as they are a very very pale copy of the ones I have seen online..... Don't know if the pictures are any better in the reproduced hardback book but I have downloaded pictures on the web from the original book which blow these pics in the soft cover book out of the water. The old photos of the houses are ""ok"" but the portraits are so faint...why bother putting them in the edition? I can't figure it out. I was going to get more copies of the book for relatives...not now."
1,information CD not included,The informational CD included with the book is not included. there is no way to download the hands on tutorials. they should tell you this up front
1,Too many problems,"I found way too many problems with this text. I perform computer forensics investigations for a living, and would not recommend this book. There is too much focus on the DriveSpy program, and much of the information is repeated from chapter to chapter. This is an example of the reviewers not actually taking a look at the book. Your best bet is to purchase the book by Warren Kruse."
1,Do not recommend,"The majority of exercises do not work. I found myself having to create exercises for my students to follow so I switched books. There is a lot of repetitive information and poor explanations.If you previous training in computer forensics you will have a problem with much of the information.Professor Kessler, what book did you actually review? I started using this book based on your recommendations."
1,Do not buy this book used! You won't be able to use the CD,This book represents the core of what is wrong with corporate America today. This book is packaged with a CD that has software on it used throughout the book. What they don't tell you anywhere is that you must register the software using a unique and one time only coupon in the cd pouch. Furthermore the software then expires in 120 days. To not mention this limitation that basically makes the book useless for resale is very deceitful on the part of the publisher and the company that supplied the software. Never have I seen such B.S. before as this when it comes for games that publishers play!!! THIS INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN BIG BOLD LETTERS -- YOU CANNOT RESELL THIS BOOK DUE TO THE ONE-TIME USE OF THE ENCLOSED CD SOFTWARE --
3,Just ok...,"As a new examiner, I found this book somewhat useful, but I thought the book was edited horribly. It looks to me as though the publisher hired an English major to edit a Computer Forensics book... too bad...If the authors read these reviews...switch editors... maybe even publishers if it's possible...switch to more mainstream tools for your examples...re-edit before releasing a second edition"
4,"Very good, complete read on digital forensic investigations","Highly recommend this book to those looking for insight into the industry of digital forensic investigations. It answered a bunch of questions for me and covers differences/similarities between corporate and public [law enforcement] investigations, overview and instructions of a few small forensics programs, description of hardware that forensics would be performed upon as well as tookits to use and is littered with useful links to must read information on the net.Had to mark a star off since it's pretty pricey for the Kindle edition, especially since it doesn't come with the DVD. Luckily my professor had extra copies and I was able to run through all the tasks that utilize the DVD data. I'd like to knock another star off because of that, but that [the absence of a DVD] is an Amazon issue and not a book one."
2,Not Current,"This books was assigned text book for ""Digital Security"" class. The two issues I had with book is the hands-on assignments never told you what the finished outcome is suppose to tell you. You go through the steps and end up with something. You do not know how to read it or even if you did it right. Second issue is it is not up-to-date. Data security is changing constantly, this book is outdated. Also, do not rent you do not have access to CD files needed for assignments."
5,Dropped the class,My husband dropped this class but he read the book anyway! He said it was really interesting and enjoyed it. I must warn you - my husband is a geek so unless you yourself are also a geek I wouldn't buy this book for recreational reading ;)
1,Not that great,"I purchased this book for some research I am doing and did not find it helpful at all. As a text book, it may be okay but for information, it is really lacking. This book is so elementary it hardly warrants the price tag."
2,CF,"I'm a digital forensic student. This was one of the first books i read as a beginner. Not a fan. It is VERY repetitive and not very focused with it's delivery. This book almost seems to be written to discourage people in the field. There are many other CF books that are better for beginners. If you're starting out, don't turn a blind eye to the books from 2005. Then venture into the intermediate.I Don't recommend this book. AND it's over 100 bucks?? I think colleges are choosing this book because of the end of the chapter assignments. LAME professors."
2,Talk about boring and repetitive,I'm not even sure I want to go into this field anymore as boring as this book made it seem. It has many things repeated over and over again just in different words.
5,Great Book...,This is a really great book for anyone interested in computer forensics or data recovery. One of the authors (Mrs. Phillips) is actually one of the professors at my college. She is extensively knowledgeable about computers and forensics in particular. I would highly suggest giving this book a read and if your are in the greater Seattle area you should consider taking one of Amelia'a classes at HCC.
2,wrong size,"I had trouble determining what size to order for myself, a women with a 7 1/2 shoe size. I ended up ordering a medium (in the white 5162) and they were too big. I did however give the socks to my husband and he liked them but that doesn't help me!"
3,Mixed Review,"I really love Danish design and Skagen's products are no exception, but ... This watch arrived with a band that needed to have several links removed for proper fit. The directions say to take it to a jeweler to have this done. I, in fact took it to a jeweler and when he tried to remove a link, the band literally fell apart. He, in turn, sent it to a watch maker who concluded the band was defective. I contacted the seller who said the problem was my fault and refused to make any adjustments or replace the band. I ended up contacting Skagen USA directly and they repaired the band for me. So, if you like Danish design and the simplicity and thinness of a Skagen watch, please get one (you'll love it; I own two) but buy from a reputable jewelry store and not from this seller!"
4,game,don't remember ordering this item . Buying USA now. To many words are required . Done Done Done Done Done
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"Maybe 3 was just too young. My son does not care for the toy at all. The pictures were appealing and he calls it the ""ice cream game"", however that alone was not enough to convince him that actually playing it would be fun. He's more attached to the game ""LIFE"" and driving the little cars along the paths."
1,"Didn't Get Me to Care! AND Slow, Slow, Slow!","The reason I could only give this book one star is that I just couldn't get through it. I got to the middle, just to give a fair shot but it was so slow and boring and pointless. I got the book my chick lit book club because it had four good reviews on amazon, and looked cute. My book club all had the same issue...where were the funny parts???? Even the girls who finished it said this was not chick lit...it was granny lit. It IS a quaint story, and an easy read for little old ladies who don't like language or sex but it just isn't for anyone under sixty. In addition to the slowness most of the story (through the middle of the book) is told from the point of the young child in the book and makes you feel like your are reading an old fashioned children's book. It had no depth and didn't make me care about the characters at all."
2,Old time rock and roll,"This textbook represents an old-fashioned approach towards Industrial Economics, based on the structure-conduct-performance paradigm that dominated the field since the 50s until the 70s. The modelling revolution of game theory, auction theory, mechanism design and other tools has not been accounted for in this text. Moreover, the modelling itself is completely lacking from the presentation of theory. In fact, there is little theory here, just verbal stories and extensive case studies. Introductory textbooks do not necessarily have to be bursting with mathematics, yet some logical structure of thinking would be welcome. There exist better textbooks that develop student's intuition. A minor vice of the book is its verbosity. Too much form & too little essence."

5,L.A. Diaries,"The life Brown led was frightening and fascinating. Descriptions of drug and alcohol addiction, family dysfunction, and suicide are harshly real but uplifting too. Brown is a survivor. His story testifies that there is hope for anyone who finds him/herself immersed in seemingly hopeless and dire situations."
5,Excellent read,"I was not familiar with James Brown's work, but after reading this one I've picked up three other novels. He writes with a seemingly effortless and pleasant prose, yet probes deep, and with merciless resolve. He writes about being a writer in Hollywood, and about his alcoholism, but mostly about how difficult it is to grow within, and eventually separate from, a family, wether it's his or yours. Highly recommended."
5,Detailed and Specific,"I was required to read ""The Los Angeles Diaries"" as part of a literature course. I was honored to attend the university where James Brown instructs and he read parts of his memoir to the class as a guest speaker. After listening to him read and after the Q&A session, I could tell that all the drama he has described in the LA Diaries is heart-filled and is simply honest. He is a down to earth, truthful writer and I would love to read his newest novel, This River, which he says goes more in depth about the relationship he has now with his sons and one of their struggles with addiction."
3,you said rarities or demos?,"forget the album name, there aren't any rarities, when someone reads ""rarities"", thinks ""alternative takes"" or ""unreleased tracks"", actually this cd shows 3 unreleased song (I mean on their studio releases) and you can find them on the ""peel session"" (and I'm sure in best performance). this cd contains just DEMOS, ok? now you're warningis not so bad, always hear some unofficial versions of classic song by a classic band is interesting, but I recommend it just to diehards of the band. try first with the studio albums and if you want something else, try the ""BBC session"", and if you even want something else try ""Unreleased Stuff""...and if you still want something else try with this cd.I appreciate this recording because Chelsea is classic, but the name should be ""CHELSEA - THE DEMOS"""
3,"hey, alright!","This is the band that should have been together back when i was discovering No Knife or Q and not U. some solid tracks, for sure"
2,Needs a healthy finger nail,These picks rely on having a healthy finger nail. Wearing one made my split nail worse. No good for flamenco strumming as catch the strings on the down stroke. If you damage your nails badly try Fred Kelly freedom picks.
5,Great piks!,"I saw Sandra Bae performed with these at the Healdsburg Guitar Festival and had great effect, so I thought I'd give it a try. They do need some getting used to, but once there they improve your picking tone and prevent your nails from wearing."
3,Flogging's too good for them...,"Perhaps Taunton could bring back the 'Cat, or maybe Keel-hauling , for their proof reading staff. Was this manuscript ever proofed before being committed to print? I'm no great speller, but this manuscript is missing part or full words in just about every chapter I have read so far. The text flows along nicely then you hit a great rock in the middle of the stream. Then you have to re-read the section a few times to try to figure out what was intended.Although beautifully photographed, many of the photos are too small or are poorly framed so that important details are hard to see. Also I have a hard time following the system of organisation in the book, which seems to double back on itself or repeat near identical sections.Compared to the companion volume 'Furniture & Cabinet Construction' this book is a big disappointment, especially after waiting for its delayed publication.Lift your game guys!"
5,Excellent,This book is worth the money at any price! The information is explained so that anyone can understand it and it also has all color illustrations to make it even easier to understand. this book along with the other Tautons press books in this series sits right next to my bench. I use it often for a reference. You wont be disappointed if your a serious woodworker.
5,Complete Joinery Guide.* * * * * * * * * *,"One of the most complete guides to joinery I have ever seen, in my approximate 50 years of doing woodwork.The book covers, Dovetails,Finger Joints.Mortises and Tenons,Rabbets,Dadoes and Grooves,Scarf Joints and Lap and Bridle Joints. Also gives a rundown on Hand Tools, Portable Hand Tools, Machines,Butt Joints and Mitre Joints.Clear professional photos and sketches.A Complete Coloured, Illustrated Guide to Joinery."
5,Great series,"I own several books in this ""series"". They are very well written, and extremely useful in the shop. They are written to be used."
3,I like Gary but....,"Personally I like Gary Rogowski. For example, he published a great instructional series on You Tube (free as opposed to some woodworking magazines that force you to pay to rent theirs). The pictures and instruction in the book are great and my only gripe is that I bought Tage Fride's book first. You see, Gary's book follows the earlier book by Tage almost to a ""T"". I would liked for Gary to blaze out in new directions rather than retread the path of another woodworking master."
3,Nice Pictures but Lack of How To Technique,"I borrowed this book from my local library. The photographs of the joinery are very nice. They beg the readers to get their hand dirty to recreate them. Some instructions are provided of how to create these joints. However, I think there are so many joints are presented in the book that it's impossible for the author to show us how to create them in sufficient details and for us to duplicate them in our projects. Some more complicated joints are mentioned in passing.As a companion book, I recommend ""Classic Joints with Power Tools"" by Yeung Chan. This book contains most if not all the joinery you need for everyday woodworking and cabinet making. Plus all the techniques to create these joints are described. In addition, simple jigs are shown to help you with these joinery. The jigs are simple and created with simple plywood so you don't have to spend your hard earned money buying the same shiny units from Rockler or Woodcraft."
2,"Many ilustrations, too few explanations","The book mainly ilustrates many type of joints, but does not give explanations about pros and cons of each one. Does not explain when to use one type of joint or another type. I was looking for knowledge about when is recommended to use each of them."
3,almost great,"The book is rather idiosyncratically organized. It goes by joint family and then type, but there is overlap and gaps. For instance it doesn't mention Parsons joints and some of the joint descriptions are really lacking, like the locked miter (totally useless description).Overall better than average with very good production values, but not comprehensive and IMHO poorly organized. The index is also less than great and some of the joint descriptions are at best sketchy to useless."
1,Received wrong book,Received wrong book but not yet finished return process..... Hoping that goes well and I'm still wanting the joinery book
2,Disjointed.,"I agree with one of the other reviewers: this is a GREAT looking book, filled with well-crafted photos. However, as a beginner woodworker, I was unable to follow most of the text. I thought this book would give step-by-step instructions on accomplishing various joinery solutions. Instead, it merely mentioned the solution and more or less told the reader to fumble his way through it himself. This may be a decent reference book for TYPES of joinery, but if you're looking for guidance in crafting the joints, you'll probably need other material to do so. What is also seriously lacking here is a glossary of terms used throughout the book to help the beginner understand exactly what the author is writing about."
2,A Disappointment,"As with most Taunton Press publications, the illustrations and photographs in this book are spectacular and the organization and layout is superb. Nonetheless, I found this book disappointing. It lacks both depth and breadth. I had hoped for a detailed review of wood joinery including some of the more unusual joinery found in Japanese woodworking. This book, however, is targeted more toward the beginner. Even so, it does not cover the details and ""tricks"" of even the most basic techniques in sufficient detail to allow beginners to easily reproduce them. Consequently, it is unclear who this book was written for - not the beginner as it lacks depth, and not the advanced woodworker as it lacks breadth. Far more effort appears to have been put into appearance and organization than in content."
4,Pilot Uncle gets a thumbs up for gifting YAY! PLANES,"I purchased YAY! PLANES for my 3 year old Niece, who loves airplanes. Watching this happy, fun video reminded me of my own youth and fascination with all things aviation. If you're a Pilot, buy an extra video to keep for your own collection. Will having YAY! PLANES reduce your aircraft insurance premiums? Probably not, but you'll have a grin on your face as you write the check!"
2,"Cheap price, cheap made","Tiny tools are nice to have for those little jobs. The flip case is a pain, it dumps the tools out while your trying to get it open. The tools are not very good quality but most small jobs don't require a tool to be very sturdy. The light doesn't work long. Finally just took tools out and put in a zip-lock to keep them handy. Pass this up, there are better sets for the money."
3,Remove from school libraries!!!!!!!!,This book is really different from what Rogers usually writes. This is a first combined writing with another author of the same genre. What I loved about this book was that it is one of the ballsiest workings of the printed word that I have read. What I hated was that I wanted to puke constantly while reading it. It is graphic-especially the second half-mostly just to shock and it lacks real artistic integrity. The first half is more poetic and dark-really enjoyable. I suggest this if you are tired James Pattersons descriptions of gore and really want to be violated literally.
5,helpful research material,I'm a docent at the Susan B. Anthony national museum. this book is very helpful for some background material for my house tours.
3,mmmm,"very interesting. thought provoking. Gates is a bit too stuffed shirt for me, and based on my travels and friendships to/in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, his views serve a predetermined agenda, I still find the series quite interesting."
3,I am working on a video critique.,"Unfortunately, this is not a long enough place to do a thorough review. Instead I am doing a video review that will be much longer than the space allotted here. I believe Dr. Gates intentions are good, but he falls to the centrism of his own upbringing and seeks guidance from people who cater his views. He does present some good info, but flawed by his own tunnel vision. This is the review on his Dominican claims. More will follow later.[...]"
3,an itsy-bitsy complaint,"This is a great documentary that many should see. It will really wake many up to the numbers and range of the African Diaspora. I applaud the efforts used in this film.However, Dr. Gates has the WORST pronunciation of Spanish and Portuguese words that I have ever heard. If you are a Harvard professor, you have enough money to buy some foreign-language cassettes at the bookstore around the corner. You have the loot to afford Rosetta Stone products too. Heck, you could have sat with some fellow profs in the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Departments and got the knack of those languages within an hour or two.Yes, it's a trivial matter. However, someone as smart and accomplished as Dr. Gates has no business garbling up two languages somewhat similar to the English language so mercilessly. He should truly be redfaced on this matter."
5,Black in Latin America,"I have recently purchased this DVD. Dr. Gates is phenomenal. I have previously purchased Dr. Gates' other DVDs: African American Lives, Part I and II and Faces of America. His programs are extremely informative and educational. Dr. Gates proves that America is truly a multiracial and multiethnic nation. There is no such thing as a pure American racially or ethnically. Many so-called pure Americans are very surprised to find a distant ancestor of a different race and/or ethnic group somewhere down the line.His latest program is extraordinary. Blacks in Latin America have an ambiguous status. The average Latin America is either biracial or triracial with European, Native, and African ancestry. He/she is quick to acknowledge his/her European and Native ancestry but is extremely loathe to mention his/her African ancestry. This program is a complete eyeopener! I recommend Black in Latin America for everyone regardless of race and ethnicity."
2,Lack Luster Bass,"I purchased this off Amazon, read the reveiws and it sounded like it would be better than the old 200 w Klipsh I purchased several years ago. Nothing could be further from the truth. My home theater system has a total of 32 individual speakers, even my floor standing speakers has dual 150w subs that out perform this. My old Klipsh is about dead even. It has absolutely NO power to speaker of, the bass doesn't hit like the reviews mentioned, they must be Sony employees. If you're looking for some thundering bass, look somewhere else or take your chance and see what I mean. It has a button to boost the bass power, what a joke.I give it 2 stars because it's pretty."
5,INCREDIBLE VALUE,"I have been running one hard for three years now. This speaker is an absolutely incredible value, which is why most stores don't sell it. I used it to replace two 18 inch subs because they were too large for the new feng shui room decore. [these are currently running in the basement directly under the room]. I am considering getting one or two more SAWX700's because the latest thinking is to have a sub in each corner of the room and I need the space in the basement. People, this is an IQ test. You will not find a better way to spend your money , except possibly the tactile transducers you bolt to the sofa (Parts Express $ 38). Their Titanic powered subs are also worth considering but my money's on the Sony."
2,Sounded great until it broke,"I really liked the performance of this unit until it just stopped working after about two years. Of course, the pathetically short one-year warranty had expired.... that's ""Sony quality"" for you. Reading reviews from other sites, it seems I am not the only one with this problem."
1,Very harmful book,"This book in no way will help a teenage girl,it will only cause her to feel more different and polarized from males and become more ashamed of any sexual needs she may have,because the book tends to carp on only the male having monster hormones and thinking about sex.What happens to the girl who has just as strong needs,she is not helped,she is thought of as a freak by society. Women rarely get the help they need in the area of temptation that men do.Women are told they will want romance and love,but they never hear what they need to hear about sex drive and how it affects the indiviual.All this book will do is cause more misunderstandings and relationship problems,because the female being a sexual being as well is overlooked."
5,Skeptical till I ... felt in love with it !,"A very dear friend of mine gave it to me, I didn't know why. Now I know.......This little book can change life, for a while, or forever : it changed the way I will look at my life for the rest of it.Simply charming, healing, uplifting, inspirational, unforgettable....."
4,"Timeless, Simple, Powerful","As a first-time author of a non-fiction bookmyself, I was starting to doubt my ownideas and plans as a writer. Then this simple,bright little book popped out at me.This is not a ""how-to"" kind of book. This ismore of a ""why-have-you-waited-so-long?"" book.It's a little friend who always loves andbelieves in you! And who the heck doesn'tneed that?And hey... that metallic-winged guy on thecover is irrestible! (I guess you could tellthat I really loved this book.)"
5,"Liberation from race, age, and gender restrictions","Cyberspace makes fluid the identification process and can allow for anonymity and even a kind of liberation from race, age, and gender restrictions. Author Lisa Nakamura argues that racial stereotypes are hardwired even in online interactions, with web directories narrowing racial categories and anonymity associated with white. Cybertypes is a simply fascinating examination of how racial ideas changed in the online environment."
4,Not bad at all.,"So far so good. I gave it four stars because there were a few pages that had a less than ideal left margin print out. (there's a line of slightly spotty printing, but it worked itself out, and it was an old problem. maybe it's my drum? I don't know.) And this is still quite new, so let's hope it prints to 6000 pages."
3,Brother TN460,"The product arrived well packaged and I have not yet used to determine their quality, but it would be good somewhere claims to be a Generic Tonner, as the ad does not say.TKS!!!"
4,Brother 1,"I'm rating the product 4 stars because I've only used the carteridge for a little over 3 weeks. If it continues for the year, it could rate 5 stars."
5,Stick with Brother cartridges--not the cheaper versions,"This ain't cheap, but it's worth it. I've learned my lesson buying cheaper toner cartridges, but they don't even come close to the quality and longevity of the Brother brand. You get what you pay for..."
2,Is this really a Brother cartridge?,"I thought I made sure to by a genuine replacement but this 'Brother' cartridge has failed to deliver a quality print for the first 100 pages -- all a bit thin and patchy, which was never the case with my Brother printer before. I've tried the usual tricks to make sure the print quality is decent but something is not quite right still. This is the first replacement cartridge I have had problems with on my 1240 printer. Fits well, has the 'authenticity' seal, everything looks good but the print quality is patchy. Could be just an oddity but this is not the usual Brother quality I've experienced previously."
4,PALE INK,"I bought on March 7, 2012 this original toner ink but comparing with previous original toner (pale ink).May be lot reference Numbers on Box # 120107Ordering and shipment excellent and fast.Ink quality 4 stars"
1,Avoid this toner cartridge,No matter how I try to level the toner in this cartridge it still prints light in the middle. The near empty cartridge I replaced was printing perfectly. It has been in my printer since January. I should have returned it right away.
3,TN460 toner,When I ordered a Brother 7820N one of the other things offered was this toner cartridge. But it does not fit into this printer. I am not a happy customer.Ursula
1,Don't buy compatible stuff from this seller!,"I bought from them last year but didn't start to use this compatible toner cartridge until the end of 2007 since my original one lasted considerable longer after the printer showed the lights for replacing it.This one last for a couple of month during which I might only printed a few dozens of pages. Then it stopped work. And ironically, I didn't throw away my original one, which actually was put back into the printer to serve my occasional printing needs.The compatible toner cartridge I bought here was made from a recycled original one, with some parts obviously worn out..."
1,poor print quality!,"Just purchased this toner cartridge refill for my Brother MFC 9700, thinking that the brand name would deliver higher quality and am extremely disappointed. Print is faint on any printer setting, never a problem with this machine before."
1,Monoprice non oem brother TN460 laser toner cartridge replacement,"Not as good as other replacement cartridges I have purchased elsewhere.They did ship a replacement very quickly, but the replacement cartridge makes a loud snapping sound,and does not print darkly or evenly. However this is only for home use, so it hasn't been worth the time and effort to ask for another replacement(unless it really fades in an unreasonably short period of time). I was impressed with their fast communication and feel they are a good company."
1,Brother TN460 Toner Cartridge,"Brother TN460 High Yield Toner CartridgeWhat was delivered was apparently not an original TN460 Cartridge from Brother. It had been poorly re-packaged with the spindle broken, making it inoperable. It appears that this was a used cartridge re-filled with toner, which had spilled throughout the plastic bag. Not what was expected and completely useless."
2,Doesn't work much better than the no brand ones,"I paid extra to get the brand name cartridge, but it smears toner just like the knock off ones do?"
2,Not a beginner's book!,"I used this book in both my ""introduction"" to stochastic processes course as well as for a more advanced Markov chains class. The book was VERY difficult to understand, and the notation does not aid in the explanation at all. I found the material to be presented in an odd order and NOT AT ALL friendly for a beginner! The material is very dense (I think that I covered perhaps 4 chapters during the course of my two semesters using this class), and does not reconcile intuition with the proofs. The Markov chains portions of the book are more understandable than the stochastic processes portions (point processes, Poisson processes, etc). I'd suggest both books by Sheldon Ross instead (the Introduction to Probability Models for beginners and the Stochastic Processes book for a beginning graduate student or beyond). I now use my copy of this book for a doorstop."
5,From Berlin to Wisconsin!,"Bruno S stars in Herzog's bleakly and more merciless humorous view of the American dream made barren.Three outsiders of the world and the life ; a prostitute , a street musician and an aging eccentric emigrate to Wisconsin ,hoping for great opportunity and finding only as answer a deep despair .Watch for Chet Atkins , the Nashville legend in the harmonicCuriously the journey to the promised land is exactly opposite to the starring of Zentropa who goes from USA to German after the WWS in search of best opportunities.This film through the years has won an increasing critical acclaim ."
1,NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"I received the package with two bulbs, thank goodness, since I only needed one. I scewed the bulb in to the lamp on the dashboard of the motorhome and pluged the lamp into the 12v outlet. The bulb worked for a couple hours before the bulb went out. I used the second bulb and it is still working after several trips. I sent an email to Ancor indicating the short life of one of the bulbs. There response was to take it back to the store. Yea right back to Amazon. I guess customer service is not something that this company feels is important. THEY SAW MY LAST ORDER!!!!!!!!"
3,Great idea but not the most functional,This is a neat piece but we found it too hard to roast all the marshmallows evenly since they spread so far apart. Some burned while some didn't brown at all.
2,Too big,"I bought this as a gift for my hard-to-buy-for dad. I was looking for a fork style stick with 4 prongs all in a row, but this was the only multi-prong stick I could find. While it seems really sturdy, it is incredibly long and the marshmallows are spread out on the stick. You'll need to have a big fire to toast them all at the same time. I think I'll stick to the single pronged sticks instead."
1,I agree Horrible Phone,"I purchased this phone because of the features it had to offer as well as the price. Not only does the phone click and have a horrible echo, the noise it makes to make a call, check the caller id, or to dial is enough to annoy anyone. To top it all off the answering maching does not work and Vtech will do nothing about it and acts as if it is my fault for thier poor equipment. I would have purchased another because of the features however, with the treatment I have received thus far why would I? I guess that saying does apply, ""if it sounds to good to be true it usally is""."
1,Not a phone you'd want to use very often,"The beeping when you dial the phone, check the caller ID, check your messages, etc, are obnoxiously loud. There's a hum in the background, and you can hear a slight echo of your own voice in the receiver when you're talking. I'm in the process of exchanging the phone."
1,I agree this is a bad phone.,"I agree with the previous review, when you press any key, the beeping sound is WAY too loud, it can actually hurt your ear. Also, you cannot retrieve message from the handset, it must be done at the base. Together with the loud irritating beeping sound (even with base volume turned to lowest level), don't ever try to check your message late at night. I did, and woke up my roommate every time. The phone is very uncomfortable to hold, some of Vtech's models have good handset ergonomics, but this isn't one of them. Holding and pressing the handset against your ear for any length of time would hurt. To top it off, I hear a loud hissing sound in addition to usually loud sidetone on the handset. There are better phones for a lot less, stay away..."
2,It didn't work for me,"I expected Vtech to be a better product. I've had nothing but problems with reception to low battery indicator after owning it for less than 9 months. The company was good enough to replace it once, but then the battery went out shortly thereafter, it was replaced and took about 2 days to charge."
1,Zero Stars! Negative Stars!!!,"Bad, horrible, terrible phone. Had this one for six months and the receiver suddenly developed enough static interference to render the phone unusable. I called/emailed VTech, who seemed to go from the assumption that they are the only people on the planet who know how a phone is supposed to work. After getting nowhere with them, I opened up the case and began prospecting for the static culprit....Loose wires, bad solder points, poor materials, I could go on...DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. p.s. DON'T BUY FROM VTECH. Oh, and by the way, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE FROM VTECH! Check out some of the refurbed Siemens or Panasonics...or if you have the cash, buy a new one from the Amazonians"
1,Don't buy,"My roommate has one of these phones. Whenever I talk on it, it cuts out so that I can't hear the other person. I have to constantly ask them to repeat themselves."
3,Odd smell,"While it had a slight patchouli smell, when I used it, it had an odd almond-scent and it just didn't clean. It should only be marketed as a hand soap, not a body soap"
2,not very good for hand soap,"i love zum and regularly use their lotion and bar soap, but this just didn't work for me. i used it for a week or so and then bought something different and put this in the closet. too strong of a smell maybe? cant put my finger on why i didn't like it since i normally love this scent."
5,Simply The Best,"I have been a fan of Indigo Wild/Zum for a long time. Frankincense & Myrrh is their most popular scent and it is easy to see why. The liquid hand/body wash can be used in the shower or as a hand soap next to the sink.It cleans great and the scent is heavenly. When I can find it on sale, I stock up as it is the only hand soap I will buy."
5,"Zum Frankincense & Myrrh! An exotic, unforgettable scent!","I'm more olfactory based than the average, and this scent is absolutely unique! The fragrance lasts on your skin for hours - and HOURS! A great value, as compared to other body soaps! Just a delightful, Oriental spice with undertones of jasmine! I use the bar soap, too! Great product!"
3,leaked,The soap smells wonderful but the soap leaked in the box and I only got about 3/4 of the product.
1,Silly,What a waste of money. This book just rehashes a lot of mumbo jumbo without any reliance on relating what actually works in the real world.
5,Simple but not Simplistic,"With a title like ""Bible for Blockheads,"" you might tend to think this book is a bit too dumbed down for all but the totally biblically illiterate. And though it's true that a newcomer to the Bible can immediately profit from this book, it has much more to offer than first meets the eye.Connelly is sensitive to the historical and literary context of each book, letting it speak for itself and address the original audience's concerns, rather than simply supporting church dogma. Sure, it has cute pictures and avoids technical theological language, but behind its simplicity lies a rather profound understanding of the nature and purpose of a biblical text.A refreshingly straightforward everyman's guide to the Bible."
5,Everything I wanted it to be!,"After my Pastor suggested this book, I immediately ordered it and it is exactly what he said it would be. Informative, not dull or boring and it clears up alot of questions. Studying the Bible is not as intimidating to me anymore!"
5,a must own....,...for any serious junglist/d n b head; this site is one of the few spots i found old/used copes; priceless....
4,Exactly what I Expected,"I liked the 2002 book better, but this one is great, too. Tried some of the recipes, and no problems there. The recipes range from simple to extravagant and there's something for any occasion or taste. Also a beautiful book to add to a cookbook collection. This book has convenient conversion chart in the back unlike last year."
1,I Was Disappointed - There Are Far Better Books,"Try the Fit To Cook, Fannie Farmer, Le Cordon Blue collection or even Betty Crocker excellent picture cook book. They are better books at better prices.The 1896 Boston Cooking School book is an absolute gem and a bargain."
1,Did not work for me,I tried to prepare a few dinners using this and the meals tasted lousy. I think she lost her touch due to her ethical and legal problems. There are better boooks out there.
2,They weren't the puzzles I ordered...,"While the puzzles are new in the box and in excellent condition, none of the six that I received are the puzzles listed in the description. If you read other reviews, you'll note that this is a recurring theme. I actually really wanted the specific puzzles that were described, and quite don't like some of the ones I received.FYI, I received At the Light Before Christmas, Union Square, Trick or Treat, Carmel Firehouse, Main Street Cambria, and Under the Chestnut Tree. None of them are as pretty as the ones listed in the description.So, only order this item if you don't really care which 6 puzzles you receive."
2,puzzles=GREAT: assortment=RIP-OFF,"I ordered this puzzle assortment as a Christmas gift for someone who LOVES puzzles, especially hometown puzzles. The individual puzzles are of excellent quality; a must for a puzzle-lover. The assortment however is misleading. We received a different assortment than advertised. I was sooo disappointed as I bought this pack expressly for the assortment advertised. To make matters worse, I was sent TWO of the SAME puzzle---not a very nice gift. Even worse was trying to fix the problem. I had to re-order the assortment and send back the original purchase. Again, I didn't receive the assortment advertised. Extremely Frustrating! I should have taken the advice of previous reviewers!"
2,Warning: WRONG photo shown!,"Hey people! WARNING: the bulb shown in the photo is NOT the actual style of this bulb. If you go by this photo as an aid in buying the correct bulb - like I did, then you'll end up with the wrong bulb for your purpose. This bulb has a solid base much like a flashlight bulb.After purchasing this ""wrong"" bulb, I searched for and ordered ""Ancor 529369"" on Amazon.com -> this WAS the correct bulb. (for my halogen desk lamp)Cheers!Jeff"
3,Spelling Workout Grade 7 (Student Edition),"This product is easy to use. If you've used it once before, you won't need the teacher's edition. It is at least one grade behind grade level, though, so adjust your order to meet your child's level."
2,Poor quality,"I ordered three sets of these reflectors. Out of the six, 2 of them had malformed reflectors, as if they had partially melted during the manufacturing process. As well, all of them have very thin plastic at the nail hole, suggesting a relatively short lifespan no matter what. All in all, a lousy product."
2,MD BUILDING PRODUCT,THE INBUILT GLUE IS VERY WEAK AND WHEN FRICTION AGAINST A SURFACE IT FALLS. THE RUBBER IS VERY THICK SO IT ISN'T EASY TO ATTACH TO THE SURFACE.
2,Occasionally Inspired but Mostly Boring,"Troma Team are the kings of building movies around awful jokes and scantily clad women whose bodies are meant to make up for a lack of character development. After all, creating interesting female characters would require some actual work, and Troma would rather poke fun than challenge people's expectations.This movie is chock-full of women in bikinis and other ridiculous outfits, and it is also occasionally downright hilarious with its awful physical humor. There is even a string of four puns in a row that is guaranteed to make any audience member laugh/groan. But it drags out a rather directionless premise for too long, and it comes off having little lasting value.2.5/5"
1,Not a fan . . .,"I normally like Troma films, they are a bit of a guilty pleasure. Silly, funny, lots of gratuitous T&A. This one seems to be an exception. I found it silly . . . but nothing else. I found myself wondering how someone actually purposely made each scene and then found themselves happy with them. If you are a huge fan of the silliness normally associated with Troma films, you'll like this one. If you are looking for other things in addition, don't bother."
2,This wasn't a good Troma Film,"I'm sorry but this movie was not good Troma work, it should of had more skin and a lot more humor."
1,wrong dvd sent,I ordered Wedding daze starring John Larroquette and received wedding daze starring Jason Biggs and isla Fisher. I didn't get what I ordered so I can't rate the item.Donna Butler
5,dvd,I was totally pleased with my purchase and how it arrived. It was excatly what I expected. Thank you. I enjoy it very much and am happy with my purchase.
4,Wedding Movie,Lame but cute. Saw it on the Hallmark channel. Its entertaining and kinda romantic. Very cute. This movie took most of its ideas from Father of The Bride by Steve Martin but tried to change it up somewhat.
2,Disappointing,I bought this book in hopes of discovering a new author and perhaps I did. This is a book of short stories but only about 45% of the stories I cared for.
2,Doesn't Live Up to Expectations....,"I was very underwhelmed by this book. I can't think of one story in the collection that I really enjoyed, and several were downright awful, most notably ""Don't You Know Who I Am?"" Several selections I couldn't even finish, which is pretty bad considering they are all short stories!"
3,Delightful fun,"This quick read is a can't miss because the short stories are written in such different voices. No matter what your taste, you'll find a story here to love. Only two of the authors -- Kinsella and Keyes -- were familiar to me. The rest were new and, for the most part, fun and exciting. One story, though, felt a bit out of place and stays with me. ""Revenge."" This does not deliver the frothy fun of the others. It's darker and perhaps that's why it's more resonant. Also, it's important to remember that when you buy this book, you are helping to support a good cause."
5,Delightful!,"I am not normally a short story lover, I prefer novels. However, I loved each and every one of these short stories. I kept the book in my purse (Yeah, It's a big purse) and read whenever I could. I found many of these stories left me wishing the author had written an entire book based upon the tale!"
4,Simply Heartwarming,"I LOVE this book! A friend gave it to me for Christmas and it was the perfect gift. Most of the stories have happy endings and involve love but some are different. I'm almost finished, and I haven't read a story I didn't like. It's perfect for a night cuddled up in a blanket with yourself."
3,Kritters Ramblings,"A collection of short stories from the best of the chick lit genre. If you read any chick lit, I would say this is worth picking up. I liked taking a break every little bit to read a short story that I could get into quick and then come to the conclusion in just a few short pages. I think I should do this more often, adds variety to my reading.Although there were some stories that I wished were full blown novels, there were some that I was glad would be ending quickly. Without going and dissecting each story, I would say that the majority were at least a little enjoyable.Pick this one up at your local library or used book store, but you may not keep it around for long."
4,Fun Read,"The first story in the series--hilarious! Reading the emails flying back and forth between the characters, seeing it from this different perspective, makes it a quick lighthearted read. It's easy to read one story, get a laugh, and either stop or read more. It's a great way to be introduced to some talented writers."
4,Girls Night In,"Nice book, especially because with one book you get to read many of the current ""girlish-books authors"", and which one you would like to read more and which not!"
1,1st time I have been compelled to write a review,"I am a big chick lit fan and a fan of many of the authors who shared stories for this book. However, I only liked about 3 of the stories. Many of the stories were depressing, morbid or just plain boring. I normally love a book of short stories and look forward to getting to know new author. Thanks goodness I bought it used and paid only 1 penny! I simply could not finish it. Once I got to the story titled ""Rudy"" I read the 1st 2 pages of the story and tossed it. I do not recommend this book at all."
4,A beautiful look at 12th Century Japan,"This is not a movie for those looking for a Slashing Samurai movie, but for those truly interested in historical Japan it is a must. The fighting is not great. The costumes alone are worth watching. Very tragic, very beautiful, reminiscient of a classic theatrical tragedy. It is particularly interesting as portrays medievil Japan instead of Edo Japan like most others."
3,Not a classic,"Perhaps in its time, Gate of Hell was a moving, stirring drama, but for me this movie was a mediocre, if not at times crude, movie.After remaining faithful to his lord, and distinguishing himself in combat, Moritoh Endo is permitted to name his own reward. He requests to marry Lady Kesa, the wife of the Imperial Gate Guard, but this wish is refused. For the rest of the movie, he obsesses about her, and tries to win her by force, which of course ends tragically.Machiko Kyo as Lady Kase does stand out, but overall there is nothing exceptional about this movie. The quality of the video is not that great either.Unfortunately, I'd have to say that the movie was somewhat of a disappointment."
5,amazing,"scott fried came to my school this week and talked about his experience and had half of the auditurium in tears it was a truly amazing story and definately made me want to buy the book. although some found it sad, i thought it was more of an inspirational story about life and who you truly are."
2,Dark Pretentious and Dull,"Dark, boring lives, void of hope, usefulness or anything mildly interesting, go on and on in a pretentious, implausible tale of ? (I am not quite certain). Little flashes of interest do appear, only to be immediately quashed by the overall depression hanging over this book. I cannot fathom how things like this get published."
3,Largely unimpressive,"Don't expect any of the flamboyant thrash of their early work with this release. The notes of Promenade, which get repeated at each of the interludium tracks, sound like a first time guitar player practicing, painful. In fact, the sound is a little bit like it hasa been recorded at home.On the other hand, Gnomus, Bydtlo, Samuel, Limoges, Hut and Heroic Gate are worthy progressive instrumental pieces.The orchestrated versions are pretty bad, as it's all synth stuff.Worth a listen or if you find it on special."
4,A bold undertaking....,"To fully transcribe and perform Mussorgsky's classical masterpiece ""Pictures at an exhibition"" in a rock setting is a achievement in it self, but Mekong Delta pulls it off nicely! ELP has also done a version of ""Pictures..."", but this is far better; less rock'n'roll-ish, and more symphonic sounding... (..and without vocals, offcause!)There's two versions of the entire ""Pictures at an exhibition"" on the CD; one with, and one without orchestral keyboards simulating the string arrangements, and personally I prefer the former, more simplistic version.The production-values has also got to be mentioned, because the CD sounds absolutely brilliant; everything sounds bright, natural, dynamic and ""open-ended"". Definetly a joy to listen to if you are a fan of both avantgarde-rock and Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an exhibition""..."
5,The Death Spiral Of Persons Who Lack Health Insurance,"40,000,000 - 50,000,000 Americans have no health insurance and another group of Americans of equal size are underinsured. Americans have to choose between food and medicine. Americans live in a land of opportunity until they have a challenge to their health. If you have a challenge to your health and if you do not have the best private health insurance you will enter a death spiral as the change in your health will drain away your money and your hope. It is a sad day - only in America, the land of no national health insurance."
4,"the rise of a ""caste system"" in the US","The authors strongly couch their presentation as attesting to the rise of a caste system in the United States. Where the caste consists of the chronically ill, infirm and marginally employed. Several members of this group are interviewed. In the MidWest, Mississipi and other regions.A common symptom is a death spiral, whereby working class individuals, who might indeed have worked very hard, but then suffered injuries, fall into a feedback loop. Where they can barely afford health case. Except for emergency room admissions. A cruel paradox.The book goes into how the stress of poverty and being ill can feed into and reinforce each other.Another ironic aspect shown is how caregivers can often lack health insurance. A bitter scenario that is all too common."
2,Inferior Parts,"I purchased your GH400 Grass Hog in the spring of 2001 and thought you had a great product. I am a 52year old woman who stands about 5'2"" tall and weighs 115lbs. Being a small woman I could never find a weed eater that was light enough for me to use. I thought I had purchased the perfect weed eater. This spring I pulled out my weed eater and after using it for about 15 min the line spool & casing just flew off and as I picked up the pieces I found the line feeder had broken and could not be put back. I came on line to try and buy the parts to repair my treasured weed eater to find you have no parts to buy. As much as I loved using this product I don't want to spend [price] a year to have the pleasure. I am highly disappointed in the the durability of the product.Theresa Goodson"
2,Great tool but not durable,"I would have rated this tool 5 stars if the Grass Hog lasted longer. I had two of these. The first went out within 2 weeks (the plastic around the drive shaft melted - okay, so I was a little rough). I learned to take it easy, let it stay cool, and my second one lasted two years. The foam grip on the left handle split almost immediately. Will not get another one."
2,HG400 Only OK for light and short term use,"The B&D; HG400 worked fine at first for light trim and edging but auto feed (AFS) quit working in a few months. After that, every few yards it was necessary to remove the cap, lift the spool and pull out just the right length of line (it was blue-smoke-time when the line came unwound from the spool), drop the spool back and replace the cap. Guess how that made me feel & what I told friends, and now you, about Black & Decker products! It can't be repaired ...HG400 is OK if you are willing to buy a new one every year."
2,Save your dollars!,"The Grass Hog power was what I was looking for but within the first hour's use the cap that retains the spool had spun off twice, causing needless minutes to rewind the lines...no easy task. The cap design is inadequate, the product designer should be asked to look for work somewhere else. I'm seriously considering returning the Hog to the maker."
3,"Holds up well with little maintenance, but no handle","We have had this trimmer for about 3 years now and it has stood the test of time pretty well with the exception of the handle breaking off in the first year. I will probably go cordless on the next purchase as dragging a cord around in a pain, but have been satisfied with results. I really like the 180 degree edging option."
1,a complete piece of trash - literally,"where's the 0 stars button ?the GH-400 is a complete [...]-in fact that is where it is now.within 5 seconds of initial use, the feeding wheel completely detached from the unit -I reattached it and within 5 seconds it detached again and again and again -after a few iterations of this, I contacted Black & Decker about itand they do not respond at all - so I had to throw it away :(I recommend you do not buy this item nor any similar Black & Decker items -it is much easier to just throw some money into the trash"
2,Don't buy it,"The first time I used the Grass Hog it worked beautifully. The 2nd time, the handle fell off. Called the Black and Decker store who told me they would sell me a screw for 65 cents. That took 3 phone calls. The third time the string ran out in 2 seconds, and it wouldn't edge or trim. I returned it."
2,"Great to use, but.....","I am on my third Grass Hog. The first one broke in a week, the second lasted a year. To Black and Decker's credit, they replaced it. Both times, there was a problem with the spool. The second time it went flying off! It is easy to use though. When it works, it works. I would recommend buying it from some place that makes it easy to return it if it breaks in a week or two, though!"
3,convenient but ...,"I am now on my second Grasshog, a fact which attests both to the appeal of a no-bump trimmer as well as the fragility of this model. On our first one, like one of the reviewers above, the line cutting blade fell off which allowed the string to wrap about the spool housing and quickly burnt the motor out (along with some of the plastic parts nearby). The second problem with this model is the speed with which it goes through nylon line. It takes more than one spool to trim our property. At five dollars or so for each replacement spool, this adds up quickly. But still, the model is remarkable for its convenience and for the ease with which the spool can be replaced. Overall, a good idea flawed by some significant design problems."
1,Black & Decker GH400,"I purchased a GrassHog string trimmer/edger because in the store it seemed to be the easiest for me the handle from a wheelchair. It worked very well at first. After running two spools of line through it, the plastic gaurd broke and the knife that cutts the string broke. Without anyway for the string to be trimmed, it kept feeding off until it wrapped around under the trimmer head. There doesn't seem to be anyway to remove the head if grass or other things wrap around it. This makes it difficult to remove wound up grass/string. I e-mailed B&D and they sent a new guard right out. The only problem is that this one only lasted one full spool of line. (They also sent a new spool of line.) If the guard were stronger and the head removable, this would be a great product."
2,"Good performance, but so expensive to operate","We really like this trimmer -- it works well -- but we find that we have to put on a new spool of line every time we cut the yard..., so this gets quite expensive. I have written to Black & Decker about this to see what gives. E-mail me if you have similar experiences: lorelei_lee@hotmail.com."
3,Black and Decker #GH400 GrassHog Trimmer/Edger,"Seems I had similar problems as I read through the other reviews.Very diappointed when it came to buying replacement parts.Almost impossible to find parts.This leads me to beleive that this is a disposable Trimmer/Edger.I hadn't planned on buying a new trimmer this year.The Black and Decker GrassHog trimmer will not be on my repacement list.Thanks,CJ"
4,"Great Value, just what I needed","I have a relatively small yard and decided to use a manual (non powered ,click clack type) reel lawnmower this year. The reel just can't get close to the fence, trees etc. Since I don't like to keep a can of gas around I opted for the Grass Hog, corded version. The automatic line feed feature really appealed to me. My first used today was seamless, I never had to check the line. Its very powerful, light enough and does a excellent job trimming what the other mower can't. For the price you can't beat it, and it had a two year warranty. The only reason I did not give it five stars was that the assembly directions were somewhat confusing."
3,Great trimmer but............,"As stated else where, the metal trim cutter broke off at the 3rd season of use. This is a vital part and brakes very easy. Can't recommend this trimmer unless you only need something temporally."
2,"Bad... Really, really bad.","Matheson is definitely one of my favorite authors, but this book is abysmal. It is pretty standard drivel that any selfish, self involved, puffed up lit student writes and thinks is Shakespeare.The lone triumph of this book is it shows that a hack of a 23 year old can write something this bad, turn himself around, change his style and purpose completely and become one of the most popular and influential writers in America.Please don't read this book. If you are considering it, read what Matheson himself writes about ""Hunger and Thirst"" in the afterword. If you think this review is bad, give this book a try:)37%, terrible.."
3,Pretty Frail Rail,"I wanted a train to go under my Christmas tree. This is pretty basic. It was placed on a firm floor. The major problem is that the wheels come off very easily and the train easily comes off the track. Often it is difficult to get the cars to hitch together. Finally, I wish there was a power switch on the controller so I didn't have to unplug the unit when not in use. The train station roof wouldn't stay on and the supplied light bridge was very flimsy and needs to be glued together.Now that the holiday is over I want to mount this train on a wood platform and build up the village and characters. I'll be adding some more track. Hopefully it will work OK, but the poor construction of the undercarriage of the cars is not a good sign, and wheels falling off while the train runs is sad. Also, on a level surface, there are still spots where speed reduces significantly."
1,cheaply built,It was not what I expected for the money. I will be returning it. Wheels pop off . It won't stay on the track and the smoke doesn't work. only the engine piece is quality the rest are cheap plastic
3,Handsome But Suseptible to Moisture,"For a diving watch, this piece allows moisture into the case far too easily. I had this watch only a month before water from the shower got inside and corroded the hands and dial. I've never taken this watch underwater since I don't dive, so I'm disappointed in how deficient the water resist feature is.The watch itself is very handsome, particularly the band which is the most attractive feature of the watch. The case and dial are huge, so if you have a small wrist and arm this thing is like wearing a dinner plate around. It would be more attractive if it were a bit smaller."
2,Looks great... Would be nice if it worked...,"This is really a great looking watch... I bought one as a gift, but it arrived with a dead battery. I had major trouble explaining to the folks at Amazon that a watch with a dead battery is basically defective... That you cannot simply replace it... Anyway, I ordered a replacement, which also arrived with the same issue. I wanted to order a third replacement but they wouldn't do so. I ended up buying another watch by another site... Wenger watches seem to have short battery life, or they are just sitting in storage for too long"
2,Adolescent writing style,"One of the worst books I've ever read. The plot was amusing enough, but the style was so overly dramatic and repetitive I kept 'falling out' of the plot, distracted by the writing itself. Every simple act was made to seem overly dramatic, almost to the point of (to make up an example) 'beads of sweat formed on her brow as she gripped the cupboard handle; would there be bread for her sandwich?' Also, I wished I'd kept track of how many times I read a variation of 'nothing could go wrong. Or could it?' I couldn't believe the frequency of '...or would she?, ...or did they?, ...or is it?' etc. Again and again and again!I chose the book based on Robert Bloch's reputation; I imagine there must be something to it, and maybe I happened to read the only bad one, but it was the first and possibly last of his books for me. Its only saving grace was that it was a quick read."
1,Poor Quality with Cyberhome,Purchased this Portable DVD player about 16 months ago. Worked fine for 1 year then all of a sudden the screen cuts out. All you can do is listen to the movies now after about 5 minutes. Coincidentally my Cyberhome unit for my home TV went bad after only 8 months. Do not buy Cyberhome is all I can say. Spend a few bucks more and get a real DVD player.
2,Not so good...,"The player came in all banged up. Not from the packaging which was fine. It was clearly used and abused. And I have to pay to have it sent back. Not happy. It's not as if I can use it, The dvd cover doesn't stay closed, it's bend upwards. I should have been offered a new one and told to keep this one."
1,Do Not Buy This!,"From day one it never worked properly. Would take several reboots to read a DVD. Had terrible problems blacking out or going dead if the power cord was jiggled. It was still under warranty, so we sent it back and the manufacturer sent us a new one. Same problems with the new one. Battery life is not long enough to play a movie all the way through. Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money on it."
2,Crapped out after 7 months,"We bought this for our toddler last summer. It was great for a while, but recently the speakers just quit working. So no audio. Then is stopped reading discs consistently or would quit in the middle of playing. The final blow came today when I turned it on and it wouldn't even boot up. I checked on getting it repaired by the manufacturer, but they want $100 plus shipping to look at it. We are going to take our $100 and spend it on another brand."
3,Battery Life is not good,I bought two of these for both of my children to use. They would put in a movie and before the movie was over the screen would start to flicker and then it went completely black. The sound is good and the picture is clear but the battery is an issue. I would never take this on an airplane cause it might only get you through take off before it quits on you.
2,Battery is a problem,"I took this on my first trip and was hoping to use it to watch movies. I had charged the unit the night before the trip and was looking forward to using it. I was very disappointed when i first turned the player on and it would not play. It was a sad day for me. It worked the next day but only lasted long enough to watch one short movie. My parents could not get it to work for the flight home either. DO NOT BUY, COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY"
2,Won't last long,"Bought this DVD player last year for our summer vacation, it worked for about 1 year, and now it wont even turn on, even when plugged into the wall. I would spend a bit more next time, to get something that is actually going to last."
3,Don't use the MasSeller Guy....just stick to Amazon,The product was good but not the right one for me. This product does not work if you have a wireless phone.The return process was long and I lost money in the transaction as I didn't buy from Amazon directly. My advice is don't go for the cheaper seller unless you are sure you are buying the correct product.
4,Almost Perfect,"I use this wireless headset for up to 8 hours at a time. I had to make several initial adjustments to the headset base to obtain a favorable speaker volume. The headband around the headset does not allow sufficient room to comfortably remove the microphone away from the mouth (2 fingers). The mouthpiece can slide up and down in front, above or below the mouth. I also own a wired Plantronics S12 headset which includes a feature that allows you to pull the mouthpiece away from your mouth without moving the headband. This omission from the wireless design is a major inconvenience for me. I gave the headset 4 stars anyway because I get crystal clear reception all over my house with no interference from other appliances."
3,Too much echoing in headset,The headset is just OK. Lots of echoing in the headset and it is hard to get the mouth piece to sit comfortably without hitting your chin or mouth.
5,Neck saver,"Works very well, easy to use, easy to set up. I love this product and the price was excellent!"
3,Order limitation,Already had one and wanted to buy three more. Could only buy two on one order--so only bought two! Bad marketing but headset works well. Or so I am told. The third one was for me.
3,wireless phone,I bought this and didn't know that you would have to have a office phone to be able to use it and it would be better to have a handset lifter if you are going to use it alot and don't want to always go to the office phone to answer. Sent mine back because it was going to cost more than I wanted to pay. I have had the wired headset phone and loved it other than carrying around to piece on my belt and the wire. I move around alot and the belt piece would seem to fall off and then create a short in the wire eventually. It does allow you to see caller ID and answer your phone without the office phone though. So I would recommend the wired phone and not a phone like the CS-55.
4,Perfect headset but!!!,"I use this headset at work and I only had this for a few months, after using it the over the head part that holds the Bluetooth broke in half where you adjust the size for your head, it snapped one day when taking it off my head, I am gonna get a replacement but they need to make it out of a better plastic. Other then that the sound it great , people on the other line can hear me crystal clear."
2,Echo was terrible,I couldn't get it to work with my RCA phone. Called customer support and they said to return it that it could be just that one. I chose not to reorder so don't know if perhaps I might just have had a lemon. Amazon handled the return beautifully.
5,Good Quality,I have used this device before so I purchased a new staff member. Came quickly. I would order from them good.
2,Very cool but poor sound quality,"Maybe I got a defective unit but I was not impressed at all with the sound quality of this headset.The reception was really amazing but I couldn't live with the tin-can sound and hearing myself. Its not feedback, its that feeling of hearing to yourself like having the microphone open all the time. I'm not sure I can even describe it.Bottom line, for the price, I wasn't willing to live with it and returned it.Too bad because the unit is so cool, comfortable and has such a good range.I have a Plantronics Bluetooth headset for my mobile and that one sounds many times better."
