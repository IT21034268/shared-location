5,Sony VAIO VGN-A290 is just an awesome laptop,I think just about everyone who reviewed it has said most of what I wanted to say. She is just a workhorse that has never let me down. I let her down but she has never let me down. I bought her back in 2004 and she is still in excellent shape. I have seen the newer Sony laptops and even though they are faster with blueray and hdmi outputs I just don't want to give up using the port replicator (VGP-PRAV1) that allows me to listen to music or movies in surround using the optical out port. Or watching TV on the laptop using the cable-tv plug. I even like to use the old RCA output jacks to record video or audio to be played elsewhere. It is just easier to deal with than messing around with HDMI and composite/component outputs. If I was to look at another laptop it would probably be the Sony VPCEC390X but w/o that port replicator I just don't see me investing in it.
2,Very Disappointing . . .,I loved Jemima J. and Bookends so I was excited for this book. What a huge disappointment! I'm glad this wasn't my first Jane Green book because otherwise I would not have read anything else by her. I recommend passing on this one and getting something worth your time.
2,disapointed,"I was extremely disappointed in Straight Talking simply because I do not feel that I or many women can truly relate the the heroine. She is searching for ""passion"" in her life in all the wrong places, while the man who can provide everything she needs for happiness is right in front of her. I found the story to be frustrating, and at times I was very annoyed with ""Tasha."" She seemed very immature at 30."
3,"*%&#(@! funny, but....","Were it not for the crude vulgarity, profanity and Tasha's sluttiness, I would give this book a higher rating. Tasha's not very likable considering she has sex with almost every man she meets. However, this book IS laugh-out-loud funny at times, and is very hard to put down."
2,Not very good,"I agree that if this were the first Jane Green book I had read I would have not persued her other titles. I really found Tasha to be so immature. None of the other characters were developed at all. Why was the character, Emma, even written?I did read it straight through but that doesn't mean much."
3,Just a So-so Read,"Having read mixed reviews of this book, I will admit that I only decided to read it because I'm a big Green fan. If you're not, I wouldn't recommend this book at all. The entire first half is very slow paced and doesn't really go anywhere. Just a lot of rambling and recollection of past relationships gone wrong. Oh, and justifying her actions and feelings to the reader (the main character, Tasha, actually addresses the reader as if in a personal conversation). Once I got into the second half (the only part where she actually has a relationship in the present tense), it started to become interesting.Thankfully, Green's storytelling skills have grown tremendously since this debut was published. Can't wait for her new book to come out in May!"
4,Slow Start but keep reading!,Straight Talking is a hard book to explain. The first half makes you think there is no plot but the second half is unbarable and you just can't put it down! Tasha is an unlikable character but so much of her makes you think about yourself. The book really picks up in the second half so don't give on Jane Green! She keeps her high status of an AMAZING chick lit author with Straight Talking!
1,And I thought that nothing could be worse than Swapping Lives,"I'm generally a fan of Jane Green's work and after suffering through Swapping Lives I figured that she must have had an off day (year) or been under pressure to crank something out and just threw some words on a page.I was sure that nothing she wrote could be as bad as Swapping Lives but she actually managed to come up with something worse.Has there ever been a character this selfish and this unlikable? I hung on hoping that she would get what she deserved, either hit by a bus or at the very least dumped and doomed to live alone with her cats but the ending was just as lame and pointless as the rest of the story.The other characters in the book weren't much better, either just as selfish and slutty or so stupid that you found yourself fuming.Save your money and buy something (anything) else."
4,Let's give Ms. Green a little more credit!,"I read the reviews of Straight Talking and was a little wary. I checked it out of the library so as not to actually spend money on it, and once I finished it, I was pleasantly surprised.Heroine Tasha, like many of us, is a fairly young single hoping to find Mr. Right. However, unlike many stories where the protagonist is simply ""unlucky,"" Tasha also struggles with a number of issues and has some bad habits to change. Rather than gloss over her problems or dismiss them as inconsequential (as many ""chick lit"" heroines do), Tasha works earnestly to overcome them.Anyone who has seriously considered their own relationship problems, or who understands how painful being single can be, will relate to this book. I think readers should give Ms. Green a little more credit for fleshing out a character whose romantic missteps aren't simply fodder for readers' humorous enjoyment."
2,Disappointed.,"I read this book just about 2 weeks ago and I seriously cannot tell you what it was about...it is that memorable. It was a bit painful to get through but I finished it. It was just ok, nothing special, nothing spectacular. I preferred ""The Other Woman"" to this book. It had more depth and it made me want to really see what was going to happen next. Only get Straight Talking if all of her other books are checked out at that time."
1,This author gets space on every new release table???,"I was trolling through the airport bookstore, looking for something light to read ona flight, and I notice that there was A LOT of Jane Green taking up table space. Interesting, I thought - there has to be a reason she sells so well. So I bought this, her first novel.The words ""Navel gazing"", ""trite"", ""boring"", and ""retread"" come to mind. The ""talk"" is so idiotic, so simple, that I would never want to befriend these people. And isn't that what you want from chick lit? A few people you wish were your friends?I have nothing against chick lit, but this was awful."
3,I enjoyed it.,"First off, I love Jane Green. Her favorite book of mine is probably Jemima J. This book is not as good as Jemima J but it's still quite funny. I read it in a day."
4,Great Read!,Loved this book! Read it nightly and toward the end looked forward to my time nightly reading it... Nice book to read in a warm bubble bath! My first novel of Jane Green and plan on reading more!!!
1,Terrible,"I am a huge fan of Jane Green and I'm glad I read her other books before this one or I wouldn't have picked up another book by her. This book was terrible. I hated the main character--truly hated her, and it wasn't the ""it's fun to hate her"" kind of distaste. Her friends were all disasters. Was anyone happy in their personal lives at all in this book? She was so shallow, sleeping with all the wrong men. Even the attempt to sleep with one man, where the chemistry was so intense, but it turned out to be a disappointment? That was unbelieveable.***SPOILER ALERT** I also found the idea that she was not in love with her best friend and had no attraction to him....and then all of a sudden she's in love and attracted to him? Uh, no. Not possible. Yes, it's possible for chemistry to grow, but not when you clearly did not love him or were not attracted to him and then you do a 180. Sorry Jane Green, you readers don't buy it.Do yourselves a favor and read Beach House or Mr. Maybe. Far more fun reads."
4,Good Classic Chick-Lit,"Straight Talk is good traditional chick-lit. A main character that is torn, confused and aging. Supporting characters that are both male and female tight knit friends. And of course there is the love triangle and guy who you hope she gets with throughout the story. This is along the same lines as the rest of her novels with small variations that make it worth the read.If you aren't into happy ever after, fluff chick-lit, then this story isn't for you."
2,Not the best from J. Green,Read Mr. Maybe -- this was too long winded for me to be interesting. I kept reading but just so I could say I finished it.
4,Not The Best Jane Green - But Not Bad For A Debut,"I love Jane Green. She is probably my very favorite author in the whole world. I have had this book for years (it was published in the UK ages ago) and I think that people are going into this book thinking it's new and will be up to her current standards. That is not the case. This is her very first book and only shows moments of her talent and brilliance. Later books really express how much she had grown and how very talented she really is.That being said --- this book is still really good and right up there with other ""Chick Lit"" books on the market today. It holds it's own against those currently being published - but might pale in comparison to her previous offers. If you go into this as any other chick book - you'll be fine. Just don't think this is a NEW Jane Green book. You might be disappointed.Cheers!"
3,Poor Choices and the Consequences We Have To Live With,"Wow!!! Were it not for her steaming love scenes, this book would not have kept me going. I don't know how she does it, but Jane Green seems to tap into the ""love-making"" scenario wonderfully.This book seemed to lack depth for me. I really enjoyed Jemima J. I have read every book of hers except for Babyville. That one is next.I felt that Tasha was shallow and it bugged me to keep watching her fall into the same traps with her describing ""passion"" and how she felt it should feel. Then, when she finally lands the ""perfect, beautiful, gentleman"" that she has longed for her whole life, she blows the deal. Anyway, it seemed quite lengthy (except for the love scenes). It was very ""chatty"". I did enjoy her friendships, though.....Oh well, Onto Babyville......"
1,Not her best work,"I am not a fan of the drivel known as ""chick lit"", but I often give Jane Green a pass because she is amusing at times.This book is not amusing. I HATE books written in that ""urban hipster"" book. I hate opening a book and know before the first chapter is out just what a glamourous and shallow life the protagonist leads and how great her clothes are and how good looking she is.I couldnt sympathize with the decisions she made. I considered her awfully lucky (and her boyfriend awfully stupid) that she ended up happy in the end.If you like this sort of thing, read ""Mr Maybe""."
5,"Oh, she's just fabulous","Being English, I've had this book since way back when... I adore Jane Green (along with Cathy Kelly, Marian Keyes, Sophie Kinsella, Adele Parks et al) because she does chick lit at it's best.Although this is one of the first of her books, it's the last I've read (Besides ""The Other Woman) I read ""Spellbound"" first (I think it's been renamed ""To Have and To Hold"" for the US???) cuz I borrowed it off a friend. Loved it.Greens books are light, easy reads and yes, the are superficial in places but, you know, what I don't want a deep and meaningful read! In places they can be very witty(British sense of humour and all that jazz) ""Straight Talking"" isn't her best book. ""Mr Maybe"" and ""Jemima J"" are, in my opnion.But anyway, buy it. It's fun."
2,"Eh...not the best but not ""DREADFUL""","This book really is not as bad as everyone says it is. It isn't great, but not a complete waste of time. I can relate to Tasha: she's dreamed of her Prince Charming all her life, had a string of flings and bad relationships, gets a good guy but he isn't good or ""wild"" enough....and so forth. She is a big immature and her friends seem totally unrealistic. But it's not completely terrible. I would read ""Being Committed"" by Anna Maxted or a Shopaholic book instead, though."
3,alright... worth reading,"I love Jane Green this is not her best novel but it was funny. My sister read it to me out loud at an airport, and after fifteen minutes I had an audience of people wanting to hear the story. It is laugh out loud funny at parts. I would recommend a friend to read it."
2,I agree with the two post,you'd better choose some other batteries. It seems it cant be recharged fully or it cant be 900mAh.
3,El Burrito de Belen,Excellent book. Very informative and a great example to teach children about traditions and the importance of intelligence vs other qualities. I would like to know if the book is translated to English. I would like to get a copy if it is. Thanks
5,life saving,"I cannot say how much the content of this book has changed our lives. The diet is simple and very nutritious, but what are amazing are the statistics, the lives it has improved and/or saved. Amongst those this diet has saved, is my father who religiously has followed it and blesses Dr. Moerman. A definite recommendation not just to those with the monster disease, but to all who would like to improve their chances of not getting it."
4,Using the 8 vital supplements.,"The weakest part of the book is the mixed units given on page 74 for the supplements. These range from tablespoons through milligrams to international units. How are all these related? What are the equivalents? In particular the doses for Iodine, Iron and Sulfur on page 50 do not make sense in the UK. Pharmasists can supply Iron Sulphate but Iodene and Sulfur are not available. This rather spoils an otherwise excellent book."
3,Dr. Moerman's Anti-Cancer Diet.,The book has some good points. However I do not agree with his recommendation totake iron tablets and to keep the body fluids acidic in order to fight cancer. This is the opposite of what I have learned from other authors about strengthening the immune system.R. Evans
5,The power of choice,"Alex Pattakos exhibits the same passion in his writing as he does in person. Especially in this books principles which give tribute to Frankl's confirmations of the inherent power of individual choice in navigating lifes labyrinths. I recommend taking a few days for reflection between each chapter, as I did, versus a straight through read. I wasn't overly surprised to find each principle relevant in my current business and personal activities. The book contains a passage to the affect that courage isn't lack of fear but knowing that there is something more important. Not being a prisoner of our thoughts could be considered courageous."
1,Don't waste your money.,I was so disappointed in this book. The author has very little original thoughts. He is basically rewriting Frankl's words and trying to gain notoriety from it. You would be way better off to just read Frankl's books.
2,Regurgitation at Best,I am a fan of Covey and Frankl and this is just a regurgation of their work at best. I bought this thinking that the good Dr might have taken their work a step further only to find him quoting them so often that I thought I was reading their works instead of his - very disappointing especially to Dr Frankl who deserves so much for his contribution to helping people. Not worth the price at any cost.
4,A Good Read !,"Author Alex Pattakos draws on his own experiences, TV sitcoms and, primarily, ""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Viktor Frankl to convey the idea that it is up to you to find meaning in your life and work. Pattakos includes exercises from his own coaching practice and some other widely used techniques (such as writing your own obituary) to help readers focus on the most meaningful elements of their lives. His book brings Frankl's ideas to bear at the office, through such concepts as imbue your work with meaning, chose your own attitude and reach beyond yourself. While this may remind you of supportive guidance you have heard before (perhaps better stated), we find that it may provide tools for seeking purpose in your daily life. Pattakos' book is useful, supportive and readable. If nothing else, it might encourage those who are unfamiliar with Viktor Frankl to read his work. He is the philosophical parent of this and many other such books."
4,thoughts,"Today at 11:00 am, I will be listening to the 4th chapter of this book while kicking a tin can around the outside of the mall in Carbondale IL."
5,Prisoners of Our Thoughts,"This is a must read book, If you have had heard of read the books written by Stephen R Covey, then you have to get hands on this one as well, very motivational and instructive."
5,Prisoners of Our Thoughts,"I just finished Prisoners of Our Thoughts and enjoyed reading about Alex's Seven Core Principals based on Dr. Frankl's work. Alex gives the reader an enlightened approach to life. ""We discover that life doesn't happen to us. We happen to life; and we make it meaningful."" By shifting your attitude about your situation you can see it from a different perspective. Alex's principals allow us to gain positive influences for both our minds and bodies."
4,Victor Frankl for Today,This book puts Victor Frank's principles of logotherapy in practical terms. It's an excellent guide to finding meaning and purpose in the work situation - and in daily life.
2,trivializes Frankl's work -rah rah self help blather,"Skip this rah-rah self help book and go straight to Frankl. This is Frankl lite, and is an attempt to cash in on the self help movement. I thought it was particularly galling for the author to compare his ""struggle"" on what career to enter and to stand up to his daddy to Frankl losing his entire family, and spending years in Nazi death camps. Even more ludicrous is comparing his uncle, who was one of the Greek junta depicted in the Costa Gavras film ""Z"" to Frankl; maybe to one of the higher level SS officers would make sense.Read Victor Frankl, or Sogyal Rinpoche or Thich Hanh or the Dalai Lama, or if they're too heavy, read Dr Phil, but save your money on this book!"
4,wrong copyright,The copyright for this book is 2000 not 2008. Good book I utilize it for teaching Clinical Ethics (the history portion of the class) to pre-health profession students 4th year undergraduate education. The need a newer edition though as the year 2000 is leaving out a lot of important ethical concerns and issues that have occurred in the past 12 years. Would also recommend Clinical Ethics in which Albert R. Jonsen is one of three authors of that book. That is the text I teach from for the majority of the class.
5,Titralac is the best,I have used Titralac for years. They are quick acting. They give me almost immeiate relief of indigestion or gas. They do not taste bad or chalky like some products. I will continue using these tablets as long as they are available.
5,Best antacid ever!,Choose this one over any other antacid-antigas fast working! If you need calcium replacement this will do the trick with small tablets that melt in your mouth!
3,Takes alot of practice,"While I think that eventually it will be easier to manage, this telescope takes some getting used to. It has such a light touch that it is easy to lose the object you are looking at and you have to refind it. But like I said, with more practice this may not be a problem.What was a problem for me was the base. It is not that easy to put together (unless you're a carpenter) and it is heavy. So when you get the tube attached to it, between the two of them, it is bulky and heavy to move around. And the instruction manual could use alot of work for assembling the base and tube. Parts should have a number or letter printed on them to make assembly much easier.Other than that, I am looking forward to years of star-gazing."
3,"Great gloves, but only for awhile",These gloves are certainly waterproof and lasted a few Ohio winters for me. Best advice do not get the inside wet -- once the inside got wet the inside lining of the gloves came apart and I could never get them to fit back in the glove.
4,Sturdy gloves that RUN SMALL,"I learned my lesson. When other reviewers write 'buy the next size larger', I will BUY THE NEXT SIZE LARGER. These are sturdy gloves that run small. My wife got an early Christmas present and I ordered a larger pair.These are NOT for winter. They'll be great for spring and fall but during a less-than-30 minute walk in the woods at 25 degrees, my fingers were cold."
4,Youngstown Gloves,"Bought these primarily for warmth during the winter mornings (temps in the 20's to 30's). They present a nice compromise between warmth and flexibility, and have held up extremely well."
3,Not Warm,First of all I liked the glove good fit looks like they will hold up but not what I would call a winter glove unless your winters don't get below freezing. If your looking for warmth this is not the glove.
2,"Stiff, undersized, uncomfortable","I have relatively small hands. Buying a large sized glove has never failed me before. But these really are stiff, undersized, and uncomfortable. Just buy the next size up from what you usually order."
1,These gloves run small & NOT waterproof,"Bought these as a Christmas gift. When my brother (who normally wears a size large glove) tried them on, they were much too small. I then tried them on and they fit me perfectly (other than the fingers being way too long) and I wear a womens medium glove. I returned them for an XL and those were perfect. I don't yet know how they are out in the weather.UPDATE - Just heard from my sister-in-law. She said my brother put them on and went out to plow. They were completely soaked through just connecting the plow to the truck."
1,"I absolutely Hate them!!! They were an absolute waste of $$. I'm begging you, don't bother!!","It was a complete waste of money. The description is completely false! It does not hold any warmth, whatsoever, you mind as well be barehanded. So that is what I have been doing lately, leaving the gloves at home, cause it doesn't provide any warmth at all. My hands freeze faster when I am wearing these gloves, than they do; barehanded!!! I am so completely disappointed in this company, even though this is my first time ever placing an order with them and I am also disappointed in AMAZON; I would have expected MORE from them. I think I will be giving AMAZON a rest from now on; they just don't seem that trustworthy anymore. I think it's all about making a sell; all they want is money! They just don't care about the product their selling nor the customers who are making the purchase."
5,great gloves,"these things are awesome!! they fit well,totaly waterproof and warmer they you might think"
3,Tough but not that warm,These gloves live up to their claim of water resistance. They are also tough enough to deal with tree trimming and chain saw work. However I did notice that my hands still got cold in short order when the ambient temperature was below freezing. Overall a good product but not meant for work in a very cold environment.
4,Great work gloves,"I purchased these gloves to work on the flight line in Afghanistan during the winter. So far I am very pleased with these gloves. They appear to be built to last, and the materials seem very strong. They were delivered very promptly, and the fit is perfect (I ordered the large, for average sized hands). I am in a fairly harsh environment, and these gloves have held up to fuel, hydraulic fluid, etc. I am definitely happy with this purchase.The only two issues that may be of concern are: 1)The finger tip area is a bit bulky, so if you need to do any work with small objects it could be tough (but most gloves are like this anyway), and 2)They are not very warm when the wind is blowing and you are not actively engaged working with your hands. Other than that I am very happy, and would buy this brand again."
2,not waterproof,"Warm and water resistant - once they soak through, in pretty short order, they are no longer warm either. I'll use them around the garden but never again for real cold weather wet operations."
3,Decent buy,It was delivered promptly. The finger tips were a little longer than I thought so there's a little bit of a gap between my fingers and the tip on the gloves. I have yet to use it to verify that it's waterproof.
2,Cheap,"While they do seem waterproof, the gloves are far from winter gloves. Attempted to use them on my morning bicycle commute in 30 degree weather, my finger tips were numb in ten minutes."
2,Poor fit,"Bought these in medium, which is my glove size for all gloves ever used, but these were way too small. I gave them to my wife and bought a pair in large. Still awfully tight but I can get them on. Only problem now is that the fingertips are a quarter inch too long. Not impressed. Buy at your own risk."
4,Well made gloves,Pros: Gloves are well made and material is super tough. Water resistant as claimed.Cons: Very tight fitting. Grip is so-so
3,Good; slightly flawed,"Lives up to it's discription... good balance of durability and dextarity and definately waterproof. In extreme conditions (ie: running them under the faucet) the outerlayers seem to get water-logged but my hands did remain dry. My only complaint, is that the inner lining of the glove is only attached at the wrist. With that, you have to be very careful taking them off so you don't pull the lining out. If you do, you can work it back into the fingers, but at times, it can take quite a bit of effort. The lack of extra stitching probably makes the glove more waterproof (less holes from the stitching) but the result is frustrating nonetheless. If you are an around-the-house handyman (like myself) who would be using these one or twice a week, for a few cold weather months per year, I recommend them highly. If you are a working professional who may use these everyday, all day, I think you'll grow tired of the shifting liner."
4,Glove me,Good med duty work gloves used for everything from preflights in cool weather to riding bike back and forth to work
4,"""Winter"" may be overstating a bit","These are great gloves. No question. But I used them when shoveling snow at about 20 degrees F and my fingertips were numb after about 20 minutes. Switched to double gloves. These will be good in temperatures down to 40, but not much colder. And plenty of winter days in plenty of places are in that category. If that's you, these are your warm, waterproof, non-bulky gloves."
1,These gloves are horrible,"I bought these for my husband for around the farm. The usual jobs like filling a water tank, shoveling snow, nothing too crazy. They were waterproof for about ten minutes and now anytime he gets near water they leak between his fingers. And of course they are made in China; it explains the quality craftsmanship...."
3,order a larger size!,"i read about these on kk cooltools; thought they'd be great, but:i used the guide for deciding which size to get: the guide indicated a M, but i couldn't even get my hands into them, so i got a L, which i can wear, but are too snug to use any kind of liner glove. wish i would have got an XL instead.i haven't tested the waterproof-ness of these, so i can't write to that. they are NOT very warm; wish i could supplement them with a liner. they are very stiff gloves and haven't loosened up at all in a month of wear.i'll keep looking for a better winter glove..."
1,Gloves,I will be returning these gloves. I bought these for my husband and each finger is the same length. I would not recommend buying these.
2,Dissappointed,"I purchased these gloves for work as an order selector in a 30 F warehouse. The gloves look great and many coworkers complimented me on their styling but it seems that's all they are good for. They didnt keep my hand very warm and within the first week they started to shred! I was hoping to find some sturdy, durable gloves and if that's your aim search elsewhere."
3,Okay above 32 degrees,"I've owned these gloves for a year. They are good work gloves above freezing, marginal in the 20's, and poor below 20. They don't do a good job of blocking the wind on cold days. They are described as ""waterproof"" but that's an exaggeration. So buy these for working outside on chilly days but don't expect your hands to stay warm in a blizzard."
1,Very Disappointed,"I used these gloves when cutting wood and trails at temperatures ranging from 0F to 32F. Unfortunately, due to the plastic layer between the fleece lining and the outer shell, your hands start sweating. When you pull the gloves off the lining turns inside-out. I took the time to ""re-assemble"" the gloves on a couple of occasions, but the third time I got fed up and threw them in the wood stove. I am not a hard to please person, but I would not recommend this product. One star is too high of a rating."
3,gloves,"I often buy unisex or men's gloves even though I am female; sizes here seem to run slightly large, so if you're female, you might want to buy a size smaller than what you usually buy in gloves not made exclusively for females. Needing the gloves immediately, I had no time to exchange them,, but wish that I had.I believe that these gloves, if well-fitted, would live up to all claims made in the description; mine, however, being slightly large, are somewhat clumsy and inflexible, as the styling seems designed to work with the hand (but only if well-fitted)."
2,Definitely Not waterproof.,I used these gloves for a few weeks in 40-60f degree weather and had no real problems until it rained heavy. In heavy rain they soaked through in about 2 hours. Definitely not good for something that claims to be Waterproof.Overall thier decent gloves. However if your looking for gloves that can handle being in heavy rain and not soaking though look elsewear.
5,Crakavelli tha Boss Deliver's some more A+ poison !,"""FROM START TO FINISH"" Part 2 of the WHITE BOY TRILOGY is just another hip-hop masterpiece from one of the most venomous MC's in the rap game! If you love the gutts & bolts of true street hip-hop & lyricism then get this album or any other ""haystak"" album for that matter. Also the dvd is quite a treat! Its pretty indepth & informative,its nice to get a better insight on this seemingly un-known artist. Great album & great package!"
5,Excellent. More of the truth from Stak,"I had previously bought Haystaks album Portrait of a White Boy and i loved it. This album once again delivers orginality and the truth. I love Haystaks lyrics and the music. I love the cd and the dvd. Through the dvd i got a picture of Haystaks life. It's just so awesome how Haystak evolved into one of the best white rappers, how he looks to god and speaks the truth. Haystak is no. 1 in my book!! CWB 4-ever!"
4,"A ""Star Trek"" book from two rising SF & F stars!","If you like science fiction and fantasy, you'll lovethis first ""Star Trek"" novel by Mark & Chuck. And if youlike it, check out their two fantasy novels, DEMON BLADEand DORELLA.Praise for DORELLA:""Different and thoroughly enjoyable""-Lawrence Watt-Evans""A very satisfying novel""-Mike Resnick""A delightful story. A truly fine debut.""-Dave Wolverton""Dorella is a lot of fun. Seldom has the struggle between good and evil been embodied in such an appealing heroine. The soceress Dorella is at once intriguingly nonhuman and touchingly human. A delight.""-Nancy Kress""The magical confrontations are exciting....It's an intriguing first novel, odd and interesting, with some wonderful and weird touches, a mix of fairy tale and sordid reality....""-LocusKeep an eye out for Mark's new ""Star Trek: DS9"" novel, TRIAL BY ERROR, cominglater this year, and his new fantasy novel, SWORDS OF THE PROPHETS,coming next spring."
4,"Entertaining, ghostly, and mysterious","So far I haven't been really impressed by the numbered Voyager novels that take place during the show. This is the first Voyager novel that takes place in the second season of the show. Beside number novels 2 ""The Escape"" and 3 ""Ragnarok"" 4-6 have been rather uneventful. This novel isn't much better, but it shows Janeway defying the prime directive in helping the Drenarians whose planet is almost being destroyed by cosmic earthquakes, while also trying to do business with the suspicious Televek. Sometimes I wonder how much Janeway's 'kindness' will go in helping almost every vunerable race in the DQ from the Ocamapa to the Drenarians. The ""Ghost"" in the crew's vision only appear during the beginning and end of the novel. Overall this book is much better than books 4-6 but not as good as ""The Escape"" or ""Ragnarok""."
3,okay,I bought this for a class and never really read it. I have no idea what it is about so I have no idea if it was well written.
5,"Life in a contemplative way, not just art.","What a revelation! This book is actually a way of life, a way of seeing world in a very different yet sobbering way. This book is for the artist within, those of us who are intimidated by our art-works and yet have a deep longing to express ourselves through them.In this book, Mr. Franck shares his way of viewing the world and expressing it through his drawings and the process is very much spiritual, it is a way of life. When I picked up this book, I thought I'd learn some technique in drawing that can help me, but I gained so much more; all I needed to learn I already have inside. Now, I can't wait to bring my sketchbook and pencil everywhere I go and start drawing."
4,Zen of Seeing and Drawing,"Very interesting book. Hand written, some issues reading text. Overall I recommend it to those interested in another view of drawing."
3,A philosophical work that is not so deep,"This book starts out by showing reader a technique of removing philosophical sunglass a typical person usually have when they look at objects. Then it wanders to signify it by relating it to something big, difficult to understand/not clearly stated, and appeal to feeling.For example, 1. Trying to make mysterious,something that is quoted here and there from Eastern philosophies, some of philosophers quoted are not even related to zen philosophy,2. Using Pope, Archbishop, big religious figures,3. Describe nonerotic aspects of drawing nudityThis book is filled with many interesting sketches, pretty easy to read, is educational if you have never thought about aspects of seeing.I would recommend this book to people who focus too narrowly in their professions."
4,California Style Cozy & Elegant Knitting Projects,"I really like this book. Susan Mischer is a very nice woman, unlike some of the knitting store owners here in Los Angeles. What is up with expensive yarn and attitude? Anyway, I agree that they are mostly geared for California weather, but making bulky sweaters is boring anyway. I just buy those at the GAP. The patterns are on the simpler side (I'm an intermediate knitter), but they are very cute & wearable, i.e. hoodies, polo shirt, dresses, accessories. It is a basic book, written in a friendly tone and has lists for good music and easy baking recipes for you knitting club members. Patterns for men, kids, boys & home too. Corrections are available on website."
1,not worth the money,"worthless -- seems like the author wrote the book so she could talk all about herself -- who cares about her favorite CD.....and for maybe one pattern worth knitting, the book is certainly not worth spending money on."
5,Fabulous Addition to Your Knitting Book Collection,This book is at the top of my favorites! It's always exciting to find a book I like as much as Weekend Knits and Last Minute Knitted Gifts. This book exceeded all of my expectations.
5,Great Low Voltage Wire Strippers,"I spent several years during high school and college installing car, boat, and home AV equipment and alarms. In that period I learned the value of a good set of wire strippers. Let me first say that those multi-slot things with a separate space for each size of wire, they are garbage. When I was installing, I had a pair of SnapOn stripper with red handles that were awesome. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find another pair of those, but fortunately I found these. This is the second pair I've bought and they work great. Easy to get into tight spots. Just a great tool."
3,I think this story was a excellent thriller,"London was very descriptive,especially at the end when the man froze to death. The only flaw was its not for the younger audience because it was too desriptive."
2,"Not very good, to descriptive , Not very exciting kids.",Did not like this that much!Did not like because had to many details
2,"This really doesn't review the book, but....","Have any of you ever seen the old movie version of this book?It's horribe!Bad soundtrack, it sounds like the they played a boombox with a junky cassete and dying cown on the set, don't buy the movie version. And he trys to kill his dog for warmth."
2,Poorly organized and Poorly Supported.,"Mr. Goldsworthly has written better as of late, especially his work entitled According to Plan, so this book was a huge disappointment. Very brief to a fault and not organized enough to digest and recall his points. Save your money and buy either Robert's: God's Big Picture or another book entitled Announcing the Kingdom."
4,A book that captures the essence of travel.,"This book captures all the senses. The stories capture the reader in a way few books can. When you don't feel like you are the traveller in the story then you long to wish that you were. The stories are exciting, heart warming, funny, and amazing. This book opens the reader to the wonderful world of travel."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE READING TIME--A SLEEPER,"Read something better; read William Dalrymple's FROM THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, or the classic, THE BLUE NILE. These stories were amateur night at the bingo hall. There were a couple touching exceptions, one about a young woman, a cabbie, and the Taj Mahal in India--- but for the most part the stories in the book were dull, witless, and lacked excitement, adventure, and charm. They sounded like fantasies of Dilbert's travels, NO, not even that exciting. Some even sounded made-up, yes, contrived for the book. What scares me is that these were the collected ""Best of"" Travelers Tales....well, I might check out some of the others, but I don't think I'd buy them, just read them quick at the bookstore."
3,"Show me XSL-FO, not XSLT","My main gripe with this book is the manner in which the author chose to present the material.Rather than focusing on ""literal"" XSL-FO, the author gives fragments of XSLT stylesheets that produce the XSL-FO. This means that the path to understanding the XSL-FO in the examples goes through XSLT.While I understand the author's point in choosing this presentation (that no one will ""really"" be coding XSL-FO by hand, but will instead be writing XSLT stylesheets to generate XSL-FO from other XML input), I don't agree that it's the best way to explain the material.I would have preferred to see actual, ""complete"" fragments of XSL-FO (both with and without larger context). I can draw my own conclusions about structuring the XSLT that I need. What I'm really keen to see is how the XSL-FO itself works, otherwise I've got no clue -what- to generate."
3,A bit obsolete nowadays ...,"The book is a definitive reference for everybody that wants to get an understanding of the rationale behind XSL-FO.That is because the basic stuff, like knowing the syntax is no longer an issue, as you can now edit the XSL-FO templates visually using editors from Ecrion or FOP.It was written before XSL-FO 1.1 came out so new things like flow-maps and bookmarks are not covered.Still, a good and useful read."
2,Second edition needed,"This book is incomplete, somewhat out of date, and contains lots of errors (e.g. pp. 24-25, where example 2.6 doesn't work at all, and the description of CSS on p. 25, which is woefully out of date and incorrect). Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of choices out there for learning XSL-FO, but the book by Doug Lovell would be a better choice."
2,Messy,"I think the book mentions all the important parts of XSL-FO, but it does not give me a good understanding of the subject. Maybe if I read it three times. The author is not able to explain the complicated matters to me, the things that separates XSL-FO from CSS. The table of contents is well organized, but when you start reading the chapters they are badly organized internally. It is hard to know what the author tried to tell you after reading a chapter. The chapters jump from topic to topic in an unpredictable way. The different chapters often repeat them self. The book contains a lot of typos and errors."
1,Why not just call it coast to coast,"I had bought this back in 2003 when I first heard Freak out tonight with Glenn Hughes. I listened to I found a woman, a hughes track , and thought Chris was basically a glenn clone. today as I was listening to some music in iTunes This album came up after the songs I selected finished. I let it run. I admit to liking Chris's voice and the tracks weren't bad so I let it play. Then "" to a friend"" came on . I was blown away . Why not just call it coast to coast ( another hughes song) and cover it instead of changing the lyrics and renaming it. That is totally lame. Don't waste any cash. Go look for the original"
2,"It grows on you, 2.5 stars","I must admit I bought this unheard, having been a bit seduced by several reviews I had read, and looking at the guest appearances on the album. After first hearing I thought ""oh dear"". However having persisted it is better than my initial impressions had me believe. It is apparent the Mr Catena was an avid student of the Glenn Hughes school of rock vocals. Not that this is a bad thing, but the vocal styles are very similar to my ear, and the music is very Hughes in style. It is okay, but Catena is not really doing anything that Glenn Hughes has not already done, and better. It is not hard to listen to and it is a bit of a grower. Having said that it is not cheap, and if it is a case of this or an alternative for your last few dollars, I'd recommend listening to it in its entirety before taking the plunge!!"
1,get what you pay for,had this product for a week before the jewels started falling off. You get what you pay for
4,Good,"This CD is really inspiring to the younger people. Emphasis on ""Younger"". This CD is more contemporary gospel than southern gospel. Oh well this is a great CD overall. I Listen to it over and over. Although her first one is her best one, this one is still very good. Keep singing Lauren. Keep singing SOUTHERN GOSPEL OK."
2,I Agree With The Previous Reviewer,"I am a huge Lauren Talley fan. She sings with such emotion and has a powerful voice. She is one of my favorite female vocalists and definitely my favorite female southern gospel singer. She is great on both ballads and up beat material. I adored her first 2 solo albums and her work with the Talley Trio. But the material on this cd just isn't up to her other work. I loved 2 songs on this cd, her remake of Crystal Lewis's ""Lord I Believe In You"", and the standard, ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". I really don't like the rest of the songs, though her voice is still passionate and powerful. I hope her next solo project will be more like her first 2 solo albums."
2,Previous albums better,"I have been a faithful listener of Lauren since her first solo album came out. I absolutely adore her voice and music. I was eagerly looking forward to this album, but I have to say that I believe her other 2 albums are better. This CD is definitely lacking the southern sound that I've always loved in her albums. She still sings great, but I don't like the new contemporary sound on this album; it's just not the Lauren Talley I've listened to for the last 4 years. So, hopefully, her future albums will bring back that signature southern sound that is so her."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the book for a ""new"" item. However there was an obvious page that had been cut out of the very front of the book. I don't think that it had any information on it but since there was a rough edge it made the book look used. It was a grandchild's birthday gift and no time to return. I was disappointed, she wasn't. It took several days for shipping. It looked to be something that all girls interested in cooking would enjoy."
5,"Great, flexible adaptable","The case has been perfect for my needs, love the protection, colors and adaptability. I was concerned about the size - but it is perfect for my LG Voyager phone (not an easy phone to cover) and my camera!! Washes perfectly and the quality is ""BUILT"" all the way..."
3,Bad Fabric,"I ordered this tie for my father-in-law for Christmas. I was Not happy with the quality of the product. The lines, which can be seen in the third picture above, are very noticable to the plain eye. I felt it made the tie look cheap. However, it is still a very fun pattern."
5,The best of the Sheep,"""As the Halloween moon rises/Sheep are fixing up disguises""With flowing rhymes and beautiful illustrations, this is the best of the Sheep books I have seen so far. The rhymes are slightly longer thanSheep in a Jeep Lap-Sized Board BookandSheep in a Shop (Read-Along), and they are fun to read. The illustrations are charming as always. The part about the sheep not being afraid in the dark wood is a good illustration of how to be brave. All in all, this is a book that you *could* keep for a special time of year ... but you probably won't."
5,Lamisil Cream for feet,I've been using this in the summer for 3 years. It's great for keeping your heels from getting rough and dry from wearing sandals.
2,Where is Hank Williams is right!?,"Okay...so I'm actually watching the movie for the first ever time as I type this review. I've been sitting here telling myself how much my father would enjoy the soundtrack. He loves Hank Williams and many of the other oldtime country songs featured. So much so I came out to Amazon to look for the soundtrack to give him as a gift. Needless to say, I was VERY disappointed and won't waste my time or money. Not that they're not good songs, but they are barely a taste of what you hear in the film and it definitely leaves out a major portion. So much for the Texas sound of the 1950s."
1,This Album Not Worth $32 With Shipping and Handling,"I'm highly disappointed with this Album. I bought the album thinking it would include all the background music featured in the movie; which movie ""The Last Picture Show"" is one of my all time favorites and I was hoping the CD would reflect the same. I should have been more diligent in my purchase. I guess it is all very true, ""let the buyer beware"". Sorry for the bad review. $32 with shipping and handling--well, if it wasn't such a hassle to go through the motions of asking to return the product for a full refund coming my way, I would do that. I'll just have to listen to my Hank Williams albums instead. Now for a fan of movie music, music from the late 50s and early 60s, try on ""American Graffiti"" for size. This album is worth every cent I paid for it because it truly follows the music, in order, of the film."
3,where's the hank williams?,I just watched this movie and I KNOW I HEARD WAY MORE HANK WILLIAMS than what is featured in this soundtrack! What gives?
1,one star - strictly for humor value,"This funny little piece of tripe can be summed up in one simple warning: ""Oooh, the big bad animal rights activists are gonna getcha!""Absolutely ridiculous."
1,Technical support is terrible,Purchased card and tried to get technical support via their email support ticket system. Ticket opened for over 2 weeks and no one has yet to view it. Their supportis terrible. Their phone support is terrible as well. They just sent me an email link to Google to research the problem myself. Card went back.Replaced with BFG GTS 250 card. Their support answered my email questions within 2 hours.
4,Fun,"Worthwhile use of the ""World's Finest"" title for this first animated meeting between the Bat and the Big Blue Cheese. (For many years, ""World's FInest""'s lead story every month was a Batman/Superman team-up, in an era when hero's team-ups were not common)Excellent adaptation of the original; however, not a slavish one -- plays the rivalry between Batman/Bruce and Superman/Clark for Lois Lane's affections a little more broadly (the visual differences between the animated and the comic versions of the scene in which Clark calls at Lois's apartment and Bruce is already there are Significant).Harley Quinn's running feud with Luthor's bodyguard/chauffeur, Mercy, is one of the high points.While it doesn't bring much new, it's a good counterpoint to the film it adapts in giving alternate, slightly more ""adult"" views on some things -- if you have one, you really need the other."
4,TWO LEGENDARY HEROES! ONE INCREDIBLE ADVENTURE!,"I'll keep it short like Grandma's shortening bread!...This is a pretty cool adaptation of THE CARTOON NETWORK'S ""BATMAN AND SUPERMAN'S: WORLD'S FINEST"" animated two hour movie!I just wished that the book was longer. The animated movie itself had a lot of adventure and action scenes that are barely touched on in this book or just simply not shown at all within these pages.Still, considering that no movie adaptation comic is ever really perfect, it's not bad. Me, though?..I just got this book so's that I can learn to draw BATMAN & SUPERMAN. ..Lol..Lol.."
4,Wonderful wedding music!,"A Hometown Weddingby Craig Duncan and the Smoky Mountain BandAn instrumental recording in the Smoky Mountain / Appalachian style.

1,Hype.,"Such a disappointment. It sounded researched, but it is hype. It is not actually about the brain. Instead it is about the defunct reading war between phonics and sight words."
3,Not as informative as you would think.,"Definitly a work if you like philosophical logic. It exhibits overkill in the area of research, but does not provide clear cut answers. It uses the A is B, A is not B, etc. type of research. Many sources are presented, however it is not reader written. I still do not know if animals have a consciousness or if I am just stupid."
1,I'm SO disappointed!,"Because Amazon never listed the songs for this new soundtrack, I just assumed (stupid me) that it would be Laura Karpman's breathtaking music for this wonderful mini-series. What a shock when I found it's only tired, old rock 'n' roll from the Way Back Machine; not ONE of Ms. Karpman's works is on it. I sent it back to Amazon w/o even opening the package. I was so upset, I wanted to cry. I just hope that there will be another soundtrack put out that does have Laura Karpman's ""Taken"" music on it, and I will be first in line to buy it!!! Until then, be warned!"
4,A solid compilation,"For those customers who were disappointed I have a few words: Read the track listing before complaining. This is a solid compilation of folk, country, rock, and standards, and the songs flow well into each other, unlike many soundtracks that juxtapose odd selections. Yes, I agree that some of the score should have been included, but this CD deserves more than the one star ratings it's been given here."
4,Pleasing poster,"It's big, bright and interesting to look at. Just need to find enough wall space to hang it. I am pleased with this product."
3,Great Poster--missing some of my favorite styles,"This poster is great for the homebrewer who enjoys the gravity ranges, ABV, and color rating of different styles for future ideas of new types of beer.It would be nice if the color ranges had an example color. Also, I like Heffeweissens, Irish Red Ales, and Milk Stout beers, and they are nowhere to be found! Red ales are a distinct style (and common style) so it doesn't belong in any of the categories. I hope there is an additional version of this poster eventually to include more styles.Nevertheless, it's still a pretty cool poster with a lot of information."
4,Beeriodic Table,Shipped on-time. Was Packed to protect and arrived undamaged. Quality met expectations. Intelligent layout and arrangement makes for great display.
3,"Ok, but not spiritual","I read about two thirds of this book before I realized it wasn't going to get any better. There are much better books out there than this one. Honestly, the author tends to ramble needlessly, and often about very straightforward concepts, like having a God-pleasing thought life. Clearly that's a good thing to want to have, but reading this book did nothing practical to help me have a more God-pleasing thought life, it just stated a lot of reasons why I should want that. BOTTOM LINE: This book is ok but not spiritual, and not particularly insightful."
2,Version was too old,I guess it was buyer beware . The version is from the 1980s . It is somewhat helpful but many roads have changed since then out here in the hills.
4,Street Atlas Western Mass,"For the money, this was a terrific Atlas because it has the directory search guide on the page or next to the page of the actual map so you do not have to shuffle through the back of the book...However, since it was a bit old, some newer sites were not included but, generally it was an excellent atlas."
2,"good ideas, needs work","...[This] book needed a lot of work. One thing I found very irritating was the continual use of And or But to start sentences, very bad practice according to what I learned in my school days. I also noticed that AK-47 M-16 blunder, made me think that the writers (assuming that Frakes actually DID do any writing)have no experience with weapons. I thought the assaults against the Klar were also weak as well. If you really want to read the book try the discount section of your local bookstore, I got it in hardback for 40 cents less than the quoted paperback price."
4,What No Sequel?,"Writing may not be Frakes' greatest talent, but he is a great storyteller. I came here looking for a sequel and am disappointed to not find one. Even though the writing is not the best, I very much enjoyed the story. As for the few mistakes in the book, well even the Great Stephen King makes them; that's why they have editors, but I guess sometimes the editor needs an editor. The book is a good read and the quotes at the beginning of each chapter are intriguing."
3,A book looking for a sequel........,"Found this at my local ... store...bought it as a lark. Started reading it yesterday, finished it today. Not much to the book (other than laughing at the mistakes)...thought I would see if Frakes had the guts to ghost write a sequel...guess not! All in all, good light reading...."
4,"Kind of generic, but a fun read","Entertaining novel about aliens plotting to take over Earth. The prose gets weighed down in ""noir"" every so often, but the action moves non-stop. Definitely worth a read if you enjoy the sci-fi/action genre."
2,Really really bad,"A few of the characters had potential, but it was never developed. The story's concept was a good start, the writing explains why the first novel was the last so far (pray!)The author, whether it was Frakes or D.W. Smith, started each chapter with an obscure little blurb from someone else's stories as if trying to impress upon the reader that they too, being the authors, were also literate. I wasn't conviced as the association with the chapters was greatly lacking.Frakes acting rarely did much for me on ST:TNG, I always thought his character was a cheap knock-off of Captain Kirk, but it seems it was better than this book. I bought it for a buck and felt ripped off. Stay clear."
1,C.F. Walklin Jr.,"Three and a half stars?! I tried to find an efficiant form of suicide half-way through it! This was, by far, the biggest piece of excrement I've ever bore witness. It switches from an M-16 on one page, then to an AK-47 on the next! I can just see Mr. Frakes when he wrote this book, while laughing a wicked laugh. ""Ahh! That'll be profound!"" Mother of God! Do yourself a favor, DO NOT read this book! It's horrifying!"
5,"Very practical kit, and it works fine","I wanted a spare charger for my CGR-S006 batteries (for the Panasonic FZ18) but soon found out that Panasonic, for some obscure reason, doesn't sell it. This Pro Power model seemed to be the only option. Despite there being no posted reviews for it, I decided to take the risk. No regrets. The charger works just as well as the original Panasonic unit. Differently from the Panasonic, the Pro Power doesn't plug directly into the wall, but has a cable. There's a reason for this: it comes with another cable attachment to hook the charger up to the car lighter or DC 9V plug, so batteries can be charged in transit. This makes the Pro Power very versatile and practical. I haven't tried the CGR-S006-equivalent battery that's included in the kit, but this, for me, is just an extra -- as is the little tripod. I bought this for the charger, and am happy with it."
3,product works but,The product work well and was in great shape when I got it the only bad thing about it was it does not hold the battery very good
1,Doesnt FIT....can damage camera!!,"The battery dosen't fit in camera properly..camera switches off when flash opens....the case of the battery is the wrong size...and has two less gold leads than the the Panasonic battery. This is a complete waste of money. It works until you move your camera..even the slightest bump disconnects the battery, which can mess up the LCD and the internal memory. How much would you pay for something that could destroy your camera? Be warned."
1,Does not work in V360!,"I ordered this item, and what showed up is a Motorola BR50 battery, which isn't even the right size for the V360, and doesn't even have contacts that line up in the right place. What the V360 actually needs is a BT50 battery, it turns out. Don't believe this description! Not a V360 battery!"
2,Don't waste your money.,E.g. 'Aureole': 18 mins of nice but empty noises. Why bother? There are so many better disks and specially better modern disks (e.g. search Zwilich & Mehta).
4,VERY informative,I read the book and I am now on my way to school. I have no doubt in my mind that I will not pass the school because I have read the book. (It is SO much like the correspondance course study book that the Navy has.) The only difference is that it is in Layman's terms. So why don't you get it and read it!!!
5,Home-School Relations Book review,"Although I am not finished with the book, I find the book so far informative and helpful with the class that I am taking. It is an easy-read, understandable and has information that you might already know mixed in with information and research not well-known."
2,Too Much Talk!!,"Busch is obviously a good writer, and, to be fair, I haven't finished this book as yet...The trio, Harry, Catherine and Carter talk and talk and talk without advancing the plot very much. This is , more or less, a mood and character piece. However the characters whine and complain constantly. I'm pushing through it, however. I realize there are some people who love this book. So maybe it's just not my cup of tea, as it were.If you weren't crazy about ""The Corrections"" from-aside from the marvelous use of language-you'll see where I'm coming from."
4,professor of literature,"-------- ... then catherine came in, reminding him that sometimes you make the trip, that's all; you just, sometimes, GO there. Because she stood in a doorway, tough-looking in her jeans and sandals and old chambray shirt - he thought he remembered its blueness on the clothesline - with her hair cut shorter . . .frederic busch, professor of literature, includes every lit-school technique to get you/me to identify with harry or catherine...i, of course, identified with harry: slightly porky, writer, reflective, not adolescent, still lustful . . . still romantic . . .""harry &..."" echoes american family and speech as faithfully as ""Plainsong"" (Haruf) chants the midwest . . .heartbreaking/heartfilling !Big"
3,"Very small, but nice for the price.","They are very small. You can't tell if you're wearing them that they are heart-shaped. But if you need a cute pair of everyday earrings, like for a second piercing in your ear..these are great. Good quality, they haven't discolored or anything. They look nice. I just wish they were a bit bigger. Fast delivery, good price."
5,How Computers Can or Have Changed Our Lives,"Electric Dreams by Ted Friedman succeeds in illuminating what computers could have been and what they are in our lives. Friedman manages to inspire us to think about a better world --- more creative, more just, more fun --- aided by computers. It's a fun book to read and inspires the mind to wonder about what might have been and still could be. It should be read by any one who communicates by e-mail, buys stuff on line, searches the web; uses computers on the job. In fact, anyone curious about how this all happened and where it will lead."
3,Crow watchers,"This is a very interesting book with much to recommend it. It provides some details into the social habits of one of the most ubiquitous birds known and helps provide some reasons why. You can't read this book and remain dispassionate about these species, no matter what negative experience and limited views you may have held about their habits. They sit at the top of the avian IQ score and are a veritable triumph in evolutionary terms through their ability to adapt to different and changing environments. The authors have allowed the reader to walk with them through many years of observation and research and that's provided a glimpse of the intricate social workings of these birds. Seldom acknowledged as more than vermin and the harbingers of everything evil, the authors have now managed to raise such low ideals to their rightful place. To one of acknowledgment and respect. Wonderful illustrations too."
4,Apes and orcas not the only smart animals,"At the top of the bird kingdom stand corvids -- crows, jays, ravens and similar animals.Ravens, especially, because of their intelligence and their interaction with people, along with their adaptiveness to civilized society, have entered the human social consciousness, and ultimately, its mythology. Witness Odin's companion ravens of thought and memory, the extensive raven stories from Indians of the U.S. Northwest and Canadian British Columbia, and more.Marzluff does a good job with a basic overview of both the science of corvids and their interaction with homo sapiens, along with basic bird-watching information."
3,"Good, but still a bit disappointing","I really, really wanted to love this book. I love birds and their doings; in fact all of nature and animals interest me. The outward presentation of the book is beautiful. Most of the pictures inside are absolutely wonderful, in a kind of subdued but powerful way, although a few seemed drab or overly simple. The book had some interesting parts; unfortunately, they were usually fleeting and not fleshed out enough before the author reverted to a style which, to me, read like a textbook. It is especially evident in the dry first chapter, which could easily put off some readers from the rest of the book. It did get better, but never reached what I'd hoped for: a fascinating, stirring and well-written read on a great subject. I'm a person who loves nature, and wanted to read this to expand on a more specific interest in the corvids. Unfortunately, I believe this book is mainly for those who are already completely in love with the subjects."
2,Not so great for reference,"I bought this book hoping for a lot of good reference art. Although there are a number of good illustrations, its mostly text, which i haven't bothered to read, since i was only interested in the art. I'd look for another book if you want good reference."
5,Excellent,"When I was a child living on my grandparents' farm, we raised three crows whose mother had been killed. It was a life-altering experience for me, and from that day forward I was hooked and in love with these smart, funny, and highly social birds. I've studied corvids (Ravens and Crows) ever since. This book is a treasure for the serious ornithologist and the backyard birder alike. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome!,"This stuff is worth every penny! I've been dreading doing my tune-up on my truck because of the horror stories that I have heard about the spark plugs breaking off when removed from the 3V 5.4 V8 engine in my Ford F150. This stuff helped me beat the odds. With Aerokroil, patience, and persistence I was able to remove every plug without breaking one of them."
3,Helps clean lead fouling from a revolver,"Lead fouling is a common problem with revolvers, especially ""dirty"" .22 caliber revolvers, and there are a variety of products recommended for removing it. Aerokroil is one of them. It certainly helps and I'm glad I bought the product for this purpose, but I find that I need to use other products in addition to Aerokroil to complete the job.Evidently, the product works well in penetrating oil applications such as those you would use something like WD40 for, but I have not used the product for this type of application."
5,It works!,"It works as advertised, matter of minutes and a stuck, blocked bolt of the fairing of my motorbike was off. The same for some components of an old trumpet. Very pleased, highly raccomended."
5,"works great, forget all other oils","i recently had to change my primary O2 sensor and had trouble removing it from the header of my car (seized). i doused it with pb blaster and went at it with my socket wrench and O2 sensor tool remover for a good hour but it just didn't budge. did some research online and found reviews for kano kroil to be quite positive for these kind of situations so i purchased the aero version from amazon. after spraying some kroil on the bolt, 10 minutes of waiting and 2 really big pulls on my 22mm wrench, it finally gave. going forward i'm not even going to bother with pb blaster, wd-40, etc...kano kroil is the way to go for rusted/seized bolts, short of using a torch."
4,if you need to get it going..that bold or nut.,"Great stuff,its has a weird smell, though.Pro's:- Bolds and nuts that are really freed up/blocked, it loosens it all- works great as a preventive grease (to prevent from getting blocked over time)- it does not bite on your handsCons:- it solves some paint'sHighly recommended."
3,Good Oil BUT,why not MAKE the best penetrating oil on the planet. Mix Acetone and Automatic Trans fluid in equal proportions to make a penetrating oil that is much better than Kroil or any other commercial prep. This is derived from Ed's Red bore cleaner. There are specs online from machinist magazine that found it to be twice as effecitve as kroil.
5,The Best I've Used,This product is superior to all the other penetrating oils I've used. I used it recently on a spark change to make sure the plugs came out clean in alumnium heads. All six came out clean and no damaged threads.Best in class in my opinion.
5,Amazing!,This stuff is amazing! It is by far the best penetrating oil I've ever used. This stuff has freed up nuts and bolts that have been rusted for years. Highly recommended!
3,Certified MBA Exam Prep Guide,"This prep guide's first part is a long list of the topics covered by the exam, and its second part is 15 - 25 multiple choice questions on each topic. It is obviously a compilation of many different people's work, and really needs to be edited for uniformity. In a few cases, the answers are incomplete or incorrect. One thing that I did not like is that the answer is printed directly below each question, so I had to spend several hours covering the answers up with post-it notes in order to be able to work through the questions without seeing the answer. Another drawback is that none of the answers are explained - all you know is whether you got the right answer or not, which makes the guide less useful as a study tool. However, it is good for helping you identify your areas of weakness so that you can study the material elsewhere. I haven't taken the exam yet, so I can't comment on how well the prep questions match up with the topics on the actual exam."
1,Not worth it.,"I boguht this text to study for the CMBA exam. It mainly consists of problems that are supposed to be similar to the actual test. I found that many were not that similar to the test and the book is not really structured to help past the test. It would serve as a good source of practice questions, the only thing is that there are many errors in some of the questions and answers, so it may steer your wrong. I would definitiely look for other resources then this unless you are just looking to a set of practice questions and are able to look up everything else on your own. Otherwise don't wast the money."
3,Could be better,"This is really a thick comprehensive book, with one major flaw in my opinion; the answers are printed below each question instead of grouped in an appendice. The eyes flow directly to the answer before the brain can process the question. A better layout (answers in an appendice) would force the reader to work through and think about the problem first. In the absence of any other test-prep book for this exam, you should buy it anyway, warts and all. I think it is money well spent but look forward to a revised edition. Be aware that several answers are wrong; from oversight or by design I don't know."
4,I now have MBA and 2 other advanced degrees and this book is worth reading,Worth purchasing as it is a review of the years of study to gain an MBA. I note that the other people reviewing this text do NOT have a background in business or have their MBA degree so I felt it was worth sharing my review with others in pursuit of their MBA degree. This book is worth reading and reviewing a few times before any final examination. BTY: I ended my MBA degree with a 3.98 GPA.
2,Not so well written,"I wasn't so pleased with this ""history"", as it's written more or less in prose format. A more straight forward chronicle would be more to my taste, but hey, it was a free book."
2,Interesting,I got this book to learn more and this group. It may be me but I did not have the history of that time period to keep it separated. I have run across a book that has the history I am going to study that and then go back and try again.
3,This is OK especially for a serious historian,It is not easy reading. There are many footnotes after each chapter but they are primarily in Latin (or French). This is meant more for a researcher. I have not yet finished (on about chapter 8.
4,An obligatory read,All the ecclesiastical stuff is hard going. Don't really enjoy reading about how the European order went about torturing them.But their valour in battle was legendary and did their duty to the death.Still haven't read their history to the bitter end yet.I needed a spell from the horrors!But it has been a good learning experience.I still side with the Templars against the Saracens.
2,Review of The History of the Knights Templars,"I found the book to be too generic in nature. There were few descriptions of battle encounters i.e.: person to person combat. Further, how could the author replicate conversations between long dead individuals? The narrative was too slow and cumbersome."
3,Somewhat confusingly written,"After reading this book I was more confused than ever concerning the history of the Knights Templar. The book tries to convey information, but I think the author gets lost in too many back references which makes the time line confusing. Recommend learning Latin and Middle High Englishbefore reading the book"
2,Review of Knights Templar,Deserves only 2 stars. Long paragraphs in latin or french without translation. Goes into too much detail much of which is trivial as well as being poorly written.As a student of the Templars history I could not recommend this book. The only positive feature was the cheap price.Monty Shnier.
2,Never have so many interesting facts seemed dull,"The book appears to be a good compilation of facts. At least, many of the facts can be found in other sources. This, of course, can be seen as both a strength and a weakness. The prose is choppy and it lacks a narrative or over arching theme. It' s a source book usefull for checking up dates and names of historical figures and events, some of which may not be easily found with an Internet search. The book has a nice cover, that is better than what follows."
2,Tedious,"I am a History buff, and am interested in learning more about little known subjects, such as the Templars, and can enjoy reading any history provided the author can generate reader interest in his subject matter, which Mr. Addison has failed to do for me. The profusion of Latin words & phrases without any attempt at translation deprives the reader of the subjects substance. The subject matter is, or can be, fascinating, however the stultifying and the excessive use of foreign phrases detracts from the narrative. Also, a book of history should include an Index, & a biblioghaphy. This book does not include either!"
3,The History of the Knights Templars,"This is a book for serious readers. The Order of the Knights Templar,or Templars, a religious and military order, was created during the Crusades to defend the Temple in Jerusalem and protect Eastern Christendom. The Templars became wealthy and powerful and the author traces the movement from its inception to its destruction, and reports opinions which seek to account for its abrupt end. The copyright dates from 1842, and the author makes extensive use of earlier Latin and French sources, not always in translation. The fourteen chapters and postscript are replete with footnotes identifying the author's sources. The occasionally antiquated English and the extensive details take the reader back into the time of the Crusades; he or she looks at the period from within rather than from outside. Those looking for more than a superficial account will find this book most rewarding."
2,A tough read.,"This book was extremely tough to read. Had I been able to skim it before purchase, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Corn knife,"I don't think it is as good as the one I had before. The blade isn't as strong, it didn't have a very sharp edge and the wood handle was not very smooth.It will work but probably wouldn't buy this brand again."
3,Just OK -not the best of the Bad Boys bunch,"I've read pretty much all of the Bad Boys anthologies and this one is just ok. I usually like Foster's anthologies, but she basically made her character Anabel into a bimbo/prostitute here. Denison's story is better, but the whole premise of why Adrian won't pose for the calander is predictable and lame. Warren story saves this bunch. Its action-packed and very steamy.Try the other Bad Boys, most are well written and sexy reads."
1,Lame!,"Ridiculous situations, set up only to bring together shallowamoral Jerry Springer type characters, and frankly [illicit]encounters. I had no idea what I was in for when I read this book, but won't be back for seconds. With so many wonderful books to read, that actually explore love, eros and all the permutations of same, why would you waste your time?"
2,Over priced,Save your money and buy the same setup from Harbor Freight. This is almost the exact same one made in China the only difference is with the gauge Turbinaire replaces the standard gauge with one that has a glass lens. With the 100.00 saved buy a longer fluid line hose and you're in business the stock hose is only 5 feet.
3,"Fun, but shallow","This book imagines the continuation of the Darcy/Bennett story from Letters from Pemberly. Elizabeth writes letters to Jane about the people she meets in the neighborhood as well as the events that go on after the wedding. The events are plausible and in keeping with the original story, but for the most part, not very interesting. The author places other Austen characters in the neighborhood under other names. This felt contrived (and who would imagine Emma Woodhouse friends with Elizabeth Bennett). I think I should stick with the original (and the BBC)."
4,Well written and enjoyable!,"This was a very fast read but to anyone that loves Darcy and Elizabeth this is a must own! As in the first book, the letters are compelling and so well written that you can certainly follow what has happened through out the years -- and not wonder about possible gaps. Enjoyable from the first letter to the last!"
3,A little too sad but worthwhile,"Like its predecessor, this was a very easy and pleasant read. At one point, a little too sad and tragic for me but pleasing overall. The book provides a satisfying portrayal of the Darcys. As was Letters from Pemberley: The First Year, this is one of the better sequels to PnP."
3,"Starts as good as the fist, BUT . . .","P&P; is one of my favorite books. I love Jane Austen so much that I did an independent study in college on Jane Austen! I bought both Letters books based on customer reviews that I would not be disappointed. The first was wonderful, and the second began that way, but loving Austen the way I do, I can trust her not to induce tears. This book became heart wrenching toward the end. I escape to other worlds when this one is too harsh, so being slapped in the face with such raw tragedy here was both unexpected and more than troublesome.I wish I had left off with the first book."
2,Far Fetched - (Spoilers),"I liked the first one so I bought. I'm still not clear on how Darcy stays alive after being in a coma for about a month in the 1800's. Did they have IV drips back then?If you can put up with it being totally unrealistic, it's not bad."
4,"Beck as a team player, great quality, well balanced","This is Beck with structure. The all around quality of the supporting musicians is terrific. The piano work is excellant and is blended well with the playing of Jeff. The style of this disc is distictively different from all of the other Jeff Beck works. This deserves a close listen, it's not just hot licks, there's alot of good listening in this one. This CD is severely under rated by people who are not paying close attention to one of Jeff's best works."
5,"A nostalgic, musical trip to the past.","This album is a culmination of the greatest groups that highlighted that colorful era of the early seventies. It serves as a ear-splitting catalyst for re-living those days when concert tickets to the best events were four dollars and the artists were ""real"".The recordings are of the best quality, and on a good system, you can feel the depth of the music - a sense of actually being there. Thank you, Bill Graham and everyone at Fillmore. I cherish the memories."
5,A great example of the most popular music of the time,"The Fillmore was for its time the best showcase of the most popular bands and music of the era. Billy Graham brought together on stage some of the finest music and performers one could ever wish to to see and hear. This box set reflects that era and the music . My suggestion for anyone who grew up during this time is to sit back and enjoy the memories of Hot Tuna,Lamb,Cold Blood, It's a Beautiful Day, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. For the people to young to remember or not yet born then,listen to this and find out what moved Rock and Roll and a Nation."
3,Too firm for me,"This mattress is way too firm for me and my wife. We bought it in order to make camping more comfortable, but I would rather sleep on the ground then spend over $100 on this. We ended up buying an egg crate and mattress pad to put over top of it. A lot more comfortable now but we had to shell out a lot of $$$ to make that happen."
3,Good to sleep on but a little bulky to store,I bought this for a guest. It was great when they were here but is quite large when folded up to store.
4,"Surprisingly comfy, great size","This is a terrific alternative to air mattresses (which I hate). Firm, easily moved though bulky to store, I'm very pleased with this product."
3,Insightful yet lacking,"The book provides insight into the players and the geopolitical climate of the time but fails to provide the connection between that week and the geopolitical climate of today. Other than opening a dialog and establishing a trade relation the author fails to make good on the title ""the week that changed the world"". It is deeply lacking links between what that week set in motion and outcomes for the next 35 years, 1972 that week and 2007 when the book was published."
3,good subject but biased research,"The 1972 submit between Nixon and Mao was undoubtedly one of the most important moments in post-WWII international relationship. I praised the author's treatment of this critical subject that still plays a role in today's global issues. However, I think the author's research for this book was rather biased and incomplete. For example, she portrayed Mao as a paranoid and sex-addicted tyrant and her book had many anecdotes that lack convincible backings. If the author can conduct more objective research on this visit (not what they ate during the banquets) and probably discuss the implications of this event on today's international relations, it would be very much valuable."
1,Awful book!,"Unfortunately, to graduate from college I have to read this hideous thing that the author calls a novel. The author has no concept of proper writing skills or how to word this book. Who the heck cares about this event that happened well over 40 years ago?! Margaret talks in circles, frequently gets off subject, goes on and on about something, and then goes backwards. I am ashamed that I have to read this piece of bad literature!"
1,Wow What a disappointment,Somehow I missed that this was a live recording...it sucks. None of the emotion and sole of the studio recordings is there.
4,"it is definitive and complete, but not that important","I really like these songs, but they seem a little contrived and not ""important"" (best description I think) because they are just so focused on being soulful that they kind of miss the mark. I have found that a lot of popular music seems to do this, and Marvin Gaye is leagues ahead of those people, but honestly I was a little dissappointed after I was done listening. Al Green's music seems much better to me, I got both cd's at the same time. I would still recommend this cd, if you have heard songs like ""lets get it on"" or whatever and you REALLY like them. contrived sappy singing and little bitty complaints just don't do it for me in music, and I felt that many songs were like this on the set. I still enjoy it, but not that much. Al Green's greatest hits is a much better choice for a new fan expanding into the genre. Also Otis Redding."
5,The best compilation by one of the greatest of the century!,"This is great. Every single Marvin Gaye hit spanning from 1962 up until his death in 1984, including five he did with Tammi Terrell. Gaye was one of the finest soul singers ever, maybe the best ever. His 1968 recording ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" is one of the finest performances in recording history. It sends chills up your spine every time. There are too many hits to mention. Every one of them is here. Outstanding and Essential!Gaye was one of those very special talends like Elvis, in which his fame and legend were so great, no one could tell them what to do, and ultimately that was his downfall. Great sound and at a great price!"
5,The best !,This CD is just as described in the title - The Very Best. I bought it for my husband and we both listen to it all the time. A must own for even fickle fans.
4,Its alright,"Are you looking for a more in-depth resource than the user manual for learning Filemaker Pro? Then this is a good book for that purpose. But don't expect to be introduced to the inner mysteries of Filemaker Pro so you can develop top notch applications. And definitely don't expect to get educated on how relational database theory applies to Filemaker Pro, you merely get a cursory glance and introduction.If you know anything about Filemaker Pro, skip this book and look for a more advanced book. This book is strictly for beginners. If you are a beginner, try to get by with the manual and the resources on the web. If that just isn't working for you, then I recommend this book. But I'm willing to bet that after working through a couple of chapters your appetite will be whetted for more in depth knowledge and this book will leave you wanting."
1,Larceny by the Author!!!!,"Too bad Mr Ham didn't research his book. 1) Pete Gray played in 1945 before Bill Veeck owned the Browns. 2) Steeler fans, he gives credit for the ""Immaculate Reception"" to the Raiders and doesn't even mention the Steelers 3) The Roger Maris Asterisk - Mr. Ham there never was an asterisk! 4) Your Softball treatment of the lying Pete Rose is wrong. All this and I only read 1/3 of the book before I became disgusted with all the errors. Don't waste your money. I am not impressed with the authors not verifying all the facts. I guess the title fits his writing."
5,motorpsycho's best album,"ivar from norway is just right. Everyone knows Led Zep. Almost no one knows mp, which is a shame. They truly stand out among all other, and I mean all rockbands of today. Their sound is inimitable, songs that are ten or 12 mins long (for good reasons), 100% cinemascope-spacerock larger than life, not less than the soundtrack of the genesis of the earth (The closing song of the album: The golden core!). Maybe Mogwai and Godspeed you bl. emp. were considerably influenced by this fantastic norwegian band.There are really no words to describe adequately the effect of mp-music."
4,Pretty dang good,These are pretty dang good gloves for the money.Pros-good heavy gripseasy velcro strap to get on and offwarm enough ( I was using them in 15F-ish)Cons-when the lining gets wet with sweat it will ball up taking the glove offthe finger tips are a bit too roomy
5,Awesome gift idea!,"Bought these gloves for my son for Christmas and he loves them. He is a commercial tiler who loves to skateboard, so these gloves have really come in handy for him."
5,best glove so far,I work as a transmission lineman and very hard on gloves. And these gloves last a full month before the fist hole. Normal leather gloves have a hole no later than the first day sometimes by lunch
4,A decent pair of water resistant gloves,"I bought a pair of large and a pair of mediums for camping. The large were for me, and the mediums for my daughter. They are not waterproof, but pretty water resistant to a point. If submerged for an extended period of time, they will get soggy. But for being in the rain and setting up a tent, they work pretty well. I found they stretch too. I am now fond of the mediums for me. The mediums I have found fit really good and snug and are easy to handle things and I have pretty large hands."
3,Fingers to long,Very snug fit and fingers to long. I wear Med. and fingers fit like large. Palm fits like small.. Very disappointed.
2,Kinda Thin,Had to return these because they didn't fit. They seemed really thin for winter gloves. Probably would have returned them even if they had fit.
3,"watch the sizes, they run very small",Watch the sizes when ordering. Order up one size at least... they run very small. I bought the wife a pair of mediums & me a large.... I couldn't even get my hand in the large. My wife said the larges are even a little tight on her. Hopefully they will stretch a bit with use. They do seem warm & hopefully the waterproof will work.... yet to be seen.
2,not durable,"while they were warm and dry, they fell apart within a week of owning them. the inner lining broke from they're stitching and came out and the finger seems began to tear and rip."
4,Best gloves ever!,"I've grown tired of searching for gloves that are waterproof and warm, yet allow me to still have some dexterity while wearing them. The search is over. I've used these for a caribou hunt in the arctic circle, halibut fishing out of Homer, and hunting ducks in the western US. Hands down my favorite gloves I've ever owned.That being said, after a few dunkings picking up decoys, they did get a little damp on the inside (hence the four stars)."
3,Bulky,"I bought these for cycling during cold and wet days. They are a bit bulkier than I would have liked, and aren't as warm as I would have like. Below 40F (4C) on my bike and my fingers are too cold. They are not waterproof, but definitely quite water resistant. I tested this by putting them under the faucet for a little while; my hands stayed dry but the fabric seemed to get wet. Anyway, the next morning the gloves were a little damp inside."
4,Nice Gloves,"Great gloves for moderately low temperatures. Could be a little warmer, but if you're only going out for a little while or if its above 20F, your hands will be warm. Haven't stuck my hands in water so not sure how waterproof they really are, but in snow they seem to stay dry. They look pretty slick too, so that's a bonus :) The grip on these gloves is amazing, no slippage will be going on with these!"
2,Used for loading aircraft. 4 hours per night,These were good for a month before they were no longer waterproof. I found my hands Soaked and freezing. They do not keep my hands warm in 20 degree weather. The only good thing about them is their dexterity.
2,Not Waterproof,"I bought these gloves to ride my motorcycle in the the rain. Within 30 minutes of riding in a heavy rain, my hands were wet and cold."
2,Offensive!,It's not just the subject matter (which is by the way rather unpleasant and rude) it's the sarcasm and the tone. I started reading this to my kid and then threw it to the floor in disgust. Mocking foreigners and teachers is probably the kind of obnoxious idiocy that a nitwit enjoys - so if your children are nitwits they'll probably like this book.
5,THIS BOOK IS GOOOD,I loved this book! When i picked it up i could not put it down! I just keep on reading!!! I would recommend this book for everyone who love comedy books!!
5,Gelo from the sickos,This is the best rapper out there! I can't wait until another album is released!
5,Great documentary,I love animals and this documentary on the intelligence of crows surprised and delighted me! Hope to see more about this as studies continue. I already know the blue jays I feed in my backyard are intelligent also and would love to see a documentary about them too.
5,A Murder of Crows,We will never look at a crow the same way again. It perfectly describes the intelligence and loyalty of these misunderstood creatures. Touching & educating.
3,"Well-written, entertaining, but falls short","I really enjoyed this writer's prose. And the story has many engaging elements. But combined with the lackluster plot, it's hard to rate this novel any higher than one star above mediocre. This is a good book, not great. I agree with the first critic review on this listing... the story could have been better."
3,"As Publisher's Weekly said, ""a snoozer.""","Reviews by Amazon readers were very encouraging but I should have read the Publisher's Weekly review at the top of the page. That review gets it exactly right; good descriptive writing, but a bit cliched, and ultimately a snoozer. If I had not been trapped on a 10-hour flight with nothing else to read, I would have put it down half way through when I realized there was very little story, just description."
2,Western Hearts (Afterglow Romantic Walks),"I listened to Western Hearts while I was sewing. This allowed me to do two of my favorite things at one time! Quilting and reading. This was the first time I had ""listened"" to a story and I intend to do it again. I especially liked the voice of Tom Cassidy. He made Amy Sandrin's story come alive for me. I loved it!"
2,Western Hearts - I GIVE THIS 5 STARS,"I listened to Western Hearts while I was sewing. This allowed me to do two of my favorite things at one time! Quilting and reading. This was the first time I had ""listened"" to a story and I intend to do it again. I especially liked the voice of Tom Cassidy. He made Amy Sandrin's story come alive for me. I loved it! I GIVE THIS 5 STARS."
4,"Panasonic 23"" LCD TV","Good value for the price. Picture is quite good with DVD's and very good with HD input. The Sony 23"" has somewhat better detail and image quality for significantly more money. The Panasonic also lacks an HDMI input, which may or may not be important to you.I found a rather modest improvement in image quality in moving from S-Video to Component Video inputs -- which is not too surprising, given this small screen size."
5,Bianchi Classic still the best,"The Bianchi Lawman is a classic holster that has been in production for ever? Originally a G. Lawrence design, Bianchi has been producing this holster for at least 20 yrs or more. I have three..and my first one is at least 15 yrs or more old....and still in excellent condition. The leather is first rate, the lining and construction are also excellent. The holster does exactly what it is supposed to do, ...carry a large single action pistol comfortably and securely. If you need a holster for a single action pistol, you can not go wrong with this one. The only difference i have noticed is that the originals I have were made in the USA, the new ones are made in Mexico...but the quality still appears to be there."
5,Very good holster,I was very impressed by the quality of this holster. It is a holster that needs no break in. I love the way it looks and retains my Ruger Vaquero. I would recommend this holster to everyone.
4,"Vicarious heebie-jeebies courtesy of a (oft-imitated, and poorly) master storyteller","Not much to add to the large number of reviews available for this book. For me, Lovecraft's work divides into two pieces: piece one is the just plain scary stuff (Dunwich Horror, Colour out of Space, In the Vault) that not only packs a punch but is well-written in a way modern horror writers always seem to miss. Piece two is the 'fantasy' type, such as The Doom That Came to Sarnath. This stuff requires one to enter the more addled side of Lovecraft's imagination, and I find it much less rewarding.This edition includes some additional works not included in other collections, so it has value beyond the average release (but boy, you sure pay up for it)."
4,A solid collection of Science Fiction/Horror classics,"H. P. Lovecraft is recognized as one of the greatest horror writers of the bygone age. This neatly bound book not only contains his best short stories, but is also an aesthetic item in itself. The smooth, crisply printed sleeve, combined with its thick, sturdy cover give the impression that this book BELONGS amongst the classics of literature. Note that this book is a medium sized codex, with medium sized print (for those of you who might have to worry about shelf space or have trouble reading).Be warned, though, this volume does NOT contain ALL of his short stories.That is perhaps the only reason I cannot give this book five stars in recommendation."
5,Great Collection in a High Quality Book,"Before the so called Golden Age of Science Fiction, H. P. Lovecraft wrote a series of stories that would now be called horror or perhaps fantasy.In this extremely well made book that meets the standards for permanence for printed materals, more than 800 pages of his stories are collected together for the first time.The selections include his famous classics ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"""" and ""The Colour Out of Space"" as well as some other stories that may not have been seen since they were originally published in the early 1900's."
4,elegant touch,A nice edition.And cause English isn't my mother tongue is a goof practise for your English..but for better translation buy a American dictionery.
2,"great service, don't like the product","This product made my hair feel stiff and behave badly. I have very fine hair. It also made my scalp take on a lot of color and contrast greatly with the skin on my face. Maybe I don't have the right application technique, but I followed the brief directions... I am disappointed! I wanted this to work!"
2,Chalky,"I felt that this product made my hair feel chalky and dull. The color doesn't blend in, and it comes off on your fingers."
5,Best stuff ever!,This stuff is great for the last 3-5 days before you color your hair. Goes on easily. Stays put all day. & so inexpensive.
1,Information Systems & Computer Applications,I took the CLEP exam yesterday and was quite surprised that absolutely NONE of the actual exam questions were derived from the examination sections in the study guide. The study guide is a waste of money. I totally wasted my time with it and do NOT recommend it.
3,Helped me on the exam,"This book is not written to really teach you the subject; however, if you are a good ""memory"" person, you will do well because the exam questions are similar to those in the book. You need to do most of the tests in the book though and there are many and many."
1,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--STUDENTS BEWARE!,"This author is notorious for errors, serious omissions, & questionable ""sources"" in his work.This book is written like a shabby novel, not like a serious history book. The Author does not trouble to distinguish between fact & easily dismissed myths, nor even long exposed & discredited propaganda efforts.If you are a student, DO NOT CITE THIS MAN'S BOOKS AS SOURCE MATERIAL IN A PAPER OR THESIS! It will quite likely result in a poor grade for your paper.And remember--no tale becomes History merely because it makes for entertaining reading"
1,Bosch Fuel Pumps use AC Delco motors,"I ordered one of these Bosch fuel pumps for my vehicle, and took it apart due to comments by the vendor after my fuel pump took over a week to arrive. After opening the assembly, I was shocked to see an AC Delco motor, the same one I could buy for 69.00 dollars. I called Bosch to report the fraud, that someone was reworking their fuel pumps and counterfitting their brand. They guy told me that they use OEM components from other vendors in Bosch products. Well, that was sure a lesson in ""branding"". What a racket. If you don't believe me, call Bosch Automotive Group in Chicago, IL.and ask them. Needless to say, I sent the expensive Bosch brand back and bought the same motor and installed that instead."
3,A good introduction to Shinto,"If you are a beginner in the learning of Shinto, you have in this book a good introduction; SHINTO: THE KAMI WAY describes the basic fundaments, for example: introduction to Shinto, types of Shinto, Shrines, festivals, social and political characteristics, Shinto history.Moreover the book has many illustrations, this way is more easy and interesting for learn and understand The Kami Way."
4,A good introduction,"The text is a bit dry, but I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a basic introduction to the rituals and beliefs of the Shinto religion. This religion is fascinating and really doesn't get the attention it deserves."
3,Introduction to Shinto,This is a not particularly attractive book. Theory is presented in a simple way but substance lacks and it does not provide tools for a complite understanding of Shinto doctrine.Filippo Zizzo
4,Very nice book,We really like this book and it was in very good shape. It is nice that it contains a lot of smaller books.
3,ok,This works great for mild nausea for me but not for anthing major. I got very car sick this weekend and the gum did nothing to help. Maybe if I would have eaten a piece before it may have helped but I didn't know I would get so sick. I am going to make a Dr. appt. to help with the major nausea as this gum does not do the trick at all.
2,"Eh, ok","Maybe it was just me, but I didn't think the gum really worked. I am 6 months pregnant and still nauseated though...The gum had a really strong taste when you first chewed into it, after about 10 minutes the flavor was pretty much gone."
3,Does help some,"I tend to get indigestion after eating meat or spicy foods. If I'm home, I usually drink ginger tea. If I'm elsewhere, I try to deal. I tried this gum to see if it would help. It did help some. It was a nice strong ginger flavor, but does lose it's flavor quickly. It's helpful in a pinch, but I'll stick to my ginger tea when I'm able."
5,"It may be sticky, but it works!","I am 1000% extremely susceptible to motion sickness. You name it and I've probably been affected by the side effects. I can become motion sick following my mouse pointer between two computer screens. To make a long story short, I purchased this product, as well as the bio-band, and lastly the bionine tablets for my very first cruise last week. The last time I stepped on a boat while docked, I became instantly sick and had to get off. I was able to do this cruise w/ the greatest of ease! I highly recommend this and the other 2 items to anyone worried about going on their first cruise and looking for something to help them combat that AWFUL feeling!"
4,Works without the Side Effects,"I recently purchased this gum at a local pharmacy. It is the ONLY product that has prevented me from getting motion sickness, without getting drowsy. I recently ran out (I just got Halo 3), however after looking at 6 local pharmacy, they apparantly do not stock it anymore. I knew I could count on Amazon!"
3,didn't work for my morning sickness,"I know that for some people this really helps with nausea, but for me it didn't. I could hardly stand to chew this gum since the flavor was so weird in comparison to other gum. It almost made me more sick."
4,Kaja likes her gum spicy!,Delicious!!! This gum has captured the essence of what makes ginger scrumtulescent. This is not some over sweetened artificial gum for the masses. This is for those who dare to take their taste buds on an journey. Tasty spicy not too sweet. 2 piece minimum.
5,Anti-Nausea Ginger Gum WORKS,"On a recent trip driving across country, I chewed anti-nausea ginger gum most of the way, and never once did I feel car sick. I feel this product works better than any other products I have tried in the past."
4,meds,"Great product and for a great price. Always getting stuff from Amazon is a great relief on the wallet and you can find everything!!!!!! Awesome medicine and it worked really fast, made the cruise so great!!!!"
1,Doesn't work,This product didn't work for me. It tasted horrible and it didn't get rid of the nausea.
3,Gum,"Have not used yet, bought it for ocean trips, or vertigo, so no rate yet, as soon as I use it I will rate it"
3,"Works, but too sticky!","I bought a box of this gum to help combat morning sickness. It definitely helps soothe the queasiness, but oddly enough, I found it difficult to chew. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but it actually stuck to my teeth. :("
4,Review of Marty Robbins - All Time Greatest Hits,This is the best recording I have ever heard of Marty Robbins.I play it often as I drive about in my F150 Ford Pick-up.
5,Husband loves these...,"He insists they are the ""real"" country singers and anything else is pop rock. I say whatever makes him happy is fine by me!"
5,Just pleasure,"I brought this c.d. because of Marty Robbins songs are just great entertaining for everyone in the family. lively and easy listening to where ever you go. the soundtrack You gave me a mountain, was one of my favourites but since than I have listen to more of his music and I throughtly enjoyed them all.He has a marvellous voice very smooth and clearly said words to all his tracks.Fast paced Big Iron & El Paso are not to be missed with Devil Woman and of cause you put them in your car, so to listen to them without getting booked for speeding, so not to fall asleep at the wheel or fantastic for what ever mood your in. Pure pleasure to hear and sing along to."
5,where did he get off to??,"this one is an artist worth questing on tapes, and etc.i share this one's airing with friends--( the guy seems to be yet a winner-- did he write anything??==i will seek it on my computer)guzzijc@windstream.net"
2,Marty Robbins - All Time Greatest Hits,"The CD was okay, but we were wanting the complete song ""Red River Valley"", not just the one verse, so that was a disappointment."
3,Bought For My Dad,I will give this the same review as the Jim Reeves..I grew up listening to my dad play his guitar and singing these songs..I don't think he was impressed because he found them outdated..
3,A good look at mostly smaller votive and everyday objects.,"This volume covers a wide variety of smaller art objects that might be found in everyday use or funerary preparations. The photos are excellent and the written descriptions are very informative. There are very few temple and tomb wall carvings to be found in this book. Small statuary,pottery, and some jewelry objects dominate the content."
4,marvelous work of litterature.,I have read his book the Angels of the Universe which is probably one of the best novels I have read in the last ten year. So I was eager to read more by this Icelandic author and I came across this book. Although I do not think it is as good as Angels of the Universe it did not let me down. It is a very good work and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting to know modern nordic litterature.
1,horrible,it says it's an A/V dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv. i'm really pissed about this product.what a waste! A/V cables that sell for 20$ are incredible. they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv.
5,Excellent gadget!,"If you are an ipod fan like me, you are going to love this item.You can control most ipod funtions, including the volume.The remote control is more than great, there is not need to point at the dock to change songs or any of the other features. I recomend this AV Dock."
2,The worst Lego toy we have,"We're big Lego fans, so when I saw this train on Pampers Rewards site, I jumped on the opportunity. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. Yes, the shapes are bright, but the button that makes sound is very hard to push, even for an adult. Also, the cars don't really stay together. My daughter loves Lego, but she barely played with this train. Good thing that we didn't spend any serious money on it."
4,Another fantastic Immortal adventure,"""White Silence"" is a very enjoyable escape into the ""Highlander"" world. The relationship between Duncan MacLeod and Hugh Fitzcairn is expanded and another part of their history is revealed. Many times while reading this adventure I didn't want to put it down. When I had read the last page I wished there was more. I think this is a very good addition to the ""Highlander"" saga and would recommend it to any fan."
4,If Jack London were an Immortal ...,"this might be his story. Gold has been found in the Yukon, and it seems half the world is on their way to that icy corner of Alaska. Hugh Fitzcairn, a charming womanizer and bon vivant, invites his friend Duncan Macleod along on what he believes will be a grand and profitable adventure. Hugh's student Danny comes from the desperate poverty of Five Corners, by way of the killing grounds of Antietam. To Danny, wealth means survival - he's lived in deadly poverty for long enough, and wants a taste of the good life. Macleod is already a wealthy man, but he yearns to see the Northern Lights.This story is one long flashback. It is full of drama and description, set squarely in the center of real historical people, places, and events. There is no need for the standard ""evil Immortal"", the Yukon itself is danger enough. Who wants to duel when the metal of your sword hilt is cold enough to freeze the skin off your fingers? Any fan of Highlander is sure to enjoy this one."
3,It's About Time Someone Wrote A Book With Fitzcairn!,"Though this was not my favorite of the Highlander novels, I loved the great humor created between Duncan and Fitz. I always loved it whenever this pair hooked up in the television series because they work wonderfully together. Ginjer Buchanan really captured the true character of Fitzcairn heckling his old pal MacLeod as usual. This ficticious account of the three immortals searching for gold is a nice portrayal of life during the gold rush."
1,Don't buy this!,"The magnetic clasp would not stay closed and my Inno fell out, causing the the internal antenna to break and the caseing to crack. Don't buy this!"
2,Started out well...pooped out,"Initially I was quite pleased with this product; it did what it was supposed to. Made nice edges with just a small amount of experimentation. I initially used it helping my son paint four rooms of an old house he purchased. Edging the first two rooms went well.However, by the third room, I began having difficult keeping the brush from sliding inward with even the smallest amount of pressure placed on the product. Switching brushes did not help; it appeared the channel and ""locking"" mechanism were not strong enough to hold the brush in place. With the brush too high in the unit, there was limited contact with the paint and thus no edging took place.Eventually out of frustration I simply switched back to the old method of painters tape and edging with a paint brush.Since then I have used this edger in a small bathroom but as a roller (not an edger) so it has provided some use as a fairly expensive small roller.Gail"
1,Please Don't Buy This Item!,"I ordered 3 boxes of the Mio 3-D Wallpaper back in February. I waited for 3 months to get the order because it was somehow not available immediately. When I finally received it, the boxes were light as a feather. I opened them only to find that what is on this picture - is not what was in the box. The item is very CHEEZY and not at all what I expected. It looks like a cardboard box cut into squares and then you have to paint them which the paint did not take and the cardboard got all soggy and it looked terrible on the wall. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE JOB DONE PROFESSIONAL! This is not worth the money."
1,"Over rated ""green"" item",These recycled paper tiles warp when wet (as with fresh spray paint) and pull right off your walls. They were better off left as cardboard and not recycled into this junk. I gave some away for Christmas presents and the people actually gave them back!
3,Works great but the included filter is trash.,"I bought and installed it and the water had a terrible smell and was plastic tasting. I bought a replacement Matrix filter on amazon and it works awesome. Water pressure is really good and strong. Definitely miles ahead of a Pur or Brita sink attachment, but be aware you'll need to buy another filter right away. I upped this review from 1 to 3 stars. I've had it 2 years and it still works great. Awesome water pressure. The only problem is the supplied filter is garbage. It works great for me with KX Matrikx filters."
5,Good Filter,"The filter came very quickly from the dealer.1. The filter diverter has good flow just from the faucet and does not slow the water down so it is faster to fill the sink when dished have to be washed2. The filter adapter does not lower the faucet outlet like the faucet filters we used to have3. The filtered water has a good flow and tastes good. There is some filtered water flow when the faucet is turned off, but that is to be expected since there is still some pressure in the filter system4. The standard 10"" filter is a lot less expensive than the proprietary filters from Brita, Pur, etc.5. The filter will last a lot longer than the filters from the ones listed above therefore lowering the cost of filtering water6. We replaced a faucet mount Brita filter that kept falling off of the faucet using the supplied adapterOverall, we are pleased with this filter and the dealer we bought it from"
2,didn't work for me,"I'm sending it back, it would not attach to my faucet without leaking and squirting all over the place. My faucet has inside threads, so I needed the adapter included, and I installed it very carefully, tried over and over, added teflon tape, nothing I could do would get a good seal.I did get a little water filtered through it, it was better than straight city water, but not as good tasting to me as through my Brita pitcher.Also important if your sink faucet doesn't already provide a lot of clearance below for washing etc, you will lose about 2 inches more clearance with the diverter.Thank goodness for Amazon customer service, so I can return it. That's why I shop here."
1,Not the same quality and built as before - beware,"I ordered this filter 2 years ago and purchased another one now for my friend. It was absolutely not the same product as before. The plastic was poorly made and it was not the durable ABS plastic as before, seems like the producer tried to cut cost and switched their supplier.The filter included has washers that has strong chemical smells which caused water to smell(as one reviewer had already mentioned). In addition, the internal dimension of the filter is made longer than a standard filter, this made it impossible to use an after market filter - if you attempted to use a standard 9.75 inch filter like I did, you will find water leaking through the top and bottom seal since the filter housing is not long enough to seal the filter properly.Unfortunately, this is no longer a product that I would recommend to anyone."
1,CHEAP PRODUCT...Bad and Painful Experience,"Poor water taste..I hate even drinking water using this water filter.. Also water is dripping from filter outlet once closed..No manual was included. 2 pages of photocopied papers for installation (not a professional way)...Cheap product! Bad and painful experience. Returned to Amazon! BEWARE SHOPPERS, DO NOT BUY"
1,"Didn't work, pieces missing",Ordered 2 of these. One box was missing the faucet adaptor. THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS. After finally getting it hooked up we had just as many particles in our water as if we were taking it straight from the tap. We found no taste difference. Maybe we hooked it up wrong - doubtful as there's not not much to it - but THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS. I've had better results from a Britta. Product comes with tool to open unit but it is still extremely difficult to open - good luck changing the cartridge. Had to contact the company for the address to send it back - it isn't listed on the packing list anywhere. They were very responsive and processed my return accordingly - thank goodness. I bought this based on all the positive reviews. This unit isn't worth the aggravation.
2,great simple water filter but...,"the filter came together was poorly made and had some dirty spot which creates mold right away. gave me bad stomachache, I changed to after market filter and I'm outta toilet. check your filter that came with it.!"
5,"unbeatable value, great quaility water","We live in San Diego. The water here is ok but has a bad aftertaste. This filter looks solidly built, extremely easy to hook up although the instruction could be better, like showing how to install the filter which is actually very easy. The filter is 0.5 micro, better than the description, and much bigger than the typical filter inside the fridge.I compared the taste of tap water, frige filtered water (a SamSung), and water from this filter (from a tap). This filter wins handsdown! It even has a faint sweet aftertaste to it. The frige filtered water comes second, which is noticably worse tasteting than water from this filter. The tap water in comparison is undrinkable without ice.For the same amount of money for a fridge filter I get this wonderful system with two high quality 0.5 micro filters. Can't be beat!"
4,"As advertised,","Very basic filtration, inexpensive and easy to use. Next time I will pay more and buy a filter designed to remove more chemicals."
4,Great Value,"This is an amazing product that is easy to install and works so well you'll wonder why you ever bothered to schlep bottled water into you house in the past. The water from this filter tastes clean and fresh. The price is excellent for all it does. It's easy to wonder if the original marketer - Sears - is trying to downplay its availability because it works better than most of their much more expensive models.The one serious flaw is that earlier models have a plastic tube that connects the faust to the unit, and the plastic breaks, splits or shears off easily. I got two broken ones in the mail and had to return them for exchange. But newer models seem to have a connector made of metal that is much more durable. Be sure to get that style."
5,"Great filter, easy to install","Product is simple to install, only takes a couple of minutes. Water comes out clean with no odor and a great taste.Pros:-Unit can be used with many 10 inch water filters, not just one particular brand.-Simple to use.-No leakage between filter attachment and faucet.Cons:-Water comes out of the spout for a couple seconds after faucet is turned off.-No indicator for filter replacement.So far, I am happy with my purchase."
1,Stay away,"I re-ordered the same item number that I purchased 18 months ago. What I received this time is completely different. The seller has replaced what was a good quality item with a no-brand cheap Chinese imitation filter, dirty and smells moldy inside the box. Not only is this not the advertised model, does not have ANY brand name at all. The only marking on the box (I kid you not, and this is the way it is spelled) are the words ""Member - Water Quarlity Association"". I am calling Amazon to demand my money back. Stay away from this filter."
4,Good Stuff!,"Good stuff, good stuff. It would be great if it were about twice as long but hey. It still reminds me of what it's like to see Santana in concert, and that is great."
5,ONE listen...........and I was hooked!!!,"I think that small amount of reviewers who gave this one star were on drugs........BAD drugs!!! I'm a drummer and while Buddy Miles may have not been Buddy Rich he certainly didn't deserve to be called a ""bad drummer."" And I'm a real sucker for a Hammond B-3 organ.....the very first note I heard of it and I was hooked. And the jams? INCREDIBLE!!! I was in high school when this album was recorded and wish I had been as fortunate as several of the reviewers were to see in person. Bad reviewers get the wax out of your ears.......you're not hearing properly!"
5,Great find,"When this was first releasted,I was 17 years old. This is one of the greatest live recordings ever. If you like Carlos or Buddy,you have to have this."
3,"Tremendous enegry ,flawed sound",This live recording has tremendous enery from all aspects. The horn section on Evil Ways makes this the best version out there. The version of Them Changes is excellent and has great vocals by Miles. Santana's guitar tone and playing is masterful. The highlite should be the long version of Free from Funkafide Filth. This is where the problem lies. Sanatana's guitar fads in and out of the mix. One second he is screamin' the next he fades out to unaudiable levels. It is a shame because this song just cooks tremendously. Too bad about the bad mix or just bad sound because is would have been a recording for the ages.
4,A unique pairing of Santana and Miles,"I used to have this album on vinyl and enjoyed it a lot. I've only listened to it one time so far, but it was not quite what I remembered. But then again, who really remembers the seventies? If you're looking for a recording of Carlos Santana in concert that you won't find anywhere else, this is it. And the blending of Santana and Electric Flag members is also a one of a kind slice of music."
2,Self-indulgence and over-indulgence go hand-in-hand,"Self-indulgence and over-indulgence go hand-in-hand with this poorly recorded relic ""Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!"" Hearing this recording again recently, I winced at how bad it sounds. In truth, this one was never a favorite of mine, and now the meandering, pointless jamming, slipshod playing, and all-around poor quality of the recording render it a relic.Perhaps the musicians enjoyed cranking out some tunes inside a dormant volcano while enjoying some of nature's finest highs, but the novelty does not translate to a pleasant experience for the listener in any setting. I would grant it two stars for historical value but hope I never actually have to listen to this sprawling mess again."
1,Hasn't improved in 35 years,"This was the first album I traded in way back when. I just played it on a streaming service to see if I was wrong. I wasn't.Pointless riffing, overdrawn song endings, endless repetition, meandering instrumentals, too much inter-song crap (including 3 minutes of band tuning at the start of ""Free Form""). Songs don't really resolve, they just end when everyone gets tired of playing.There are much better versions of ""Evil Ways"" out there; this one is OK, but seems rushed and I'm not that fond of Miles' howling throughout.I truly don't get the 5-star reviews of this. I've never been that stoned, including when I bought this new. If ""Hey man, lets get together and jam."" is your thing, then maybe you'll dig this. I don't.Oh yeah, it's miked badly too."
5,An excellent book for all designers,"Rosemary Ingham really captured the fundamentals of what it takes in creating and collaberating a design. Her book is full of examples of sources of inspiration, forms of play analysis, commentary on the NEA, and transcripts of directors and designers communicating ideals. This is a wonderful book and it belongs on every designers shelf."
5,"love, love, love","I LOVE these sissors. They really are non-stick. I mount my own stamps, and used them to cut out the backing foam, which is very sticky. They are great with double stick tape. If anything does stick, it is very easy to clean off. My only regret is not buying them sooner!"
5,best scissors,I use these scissors at work. You can cut tape or labels and the blades never get sticky. You get a straight even cut every time. I wrote my name on them so that they will always come back to my desk.
4,Works great !!,"I needed an extension for my antenna from my reciever dock inside to a spot outside. This works great, I haven't lost any signal and I haven't had any problems so far with rain causing issues. I would have gave it 5 stars but the cable is the thickness of normal coaxial (simple terms: normal electonic cords) and makes it very difficult to run through window seals, ect."
5,A must have for optimal antenna placement,"I bought this to accompany the Sirius Antenna kit I purchased. This allowed me to place my antenna atop a 20 ft. pole, thus clearing my roof line. Even with this extension cable, I have never had a loss of signal. It works great."
5,Works wonders,"Easily solved the connection problem of lengthening the 20 foot antenna cable which comes from the manufacturer. Allows you to locate the receiver and the antenna so you have reception where you need in the house. Simple to attach to the antenna cable, just remember to locate the junction in a dry place and you will be good to go. We have not seen a loss of signal strength. Good value."
4,Exactly what I thought it would be,"This was a security item. My friend bought a cabin in the woods, pretty remote, no streetlights. If someone was in the house & she clicked on the lantern, they would have time to go out the back door. Thereby avoiding a confrontation. We've been up there a couple of times & it works great. It has 3 settings, high, low, nightlight. The remote will keep rotating through the settings if you keep pushing the button. Of course, it IS fluorescent so the quality of light isn't the greatest. It takes eight (8) DD batteries."
4,Music from another world?,"Soem of the wilest music I have ever heard. Not sure I ""get"" the Concerto, but it is endlessly fascinating. (Pay no attention to the poster of 3 April. He's written the same thing next to each Babbitt CD I see at Amazon.)"
4,Excelent - VERY ADVANCED,"Thank you for the great book.Very advanced writing, I do not suggest it for college level students.regards,Luiz"
4,Whitesnake at their best.,"This is one of those fun CDs to listen to. High power, good clean fun. Sex, drugs, and rock n roll!!!!!! Party on!!"
4,The guitar playing is cool,"This is a good album. When I first saw the video for ""Still of the Night"" back in 1987 I was really impressed with the song. John Sykes delivers some great guitar solos and riffs on this release. I like the way he starts off most of the songs with the guitar. Good songs include ""Don't Turn Away"" and ""Is if Love."" The musicians and David Coverdale did a good job with the songs and the production is also good. John Sykes worked wonders on this album, and there's no double he was the driving source of its success. Sykes is truly original and has a sound all his own. Good album."
4,"DVD will not play , beware !!","Purchased the collectors edition of this wonderful CD and could not wait to view the DVD , but forget it , DVD is not viewable on players in the states. For the CD , excellent sound quality over the original CD and the packaging of this edition is very impressive."
5,whitesnake touches my soul,"Best soft rock album ever. I put it on on my way to work, and I'm playing it again this weekend. Highly recommended."
5,"Naughty baby, very naughty...","Yep. I remember those Wednesday afternoons in the late eighties... No school, sitting around the house surfing all the music channels on TV. And seeing Tawny Kitaen spread across this classy Jaguar to a Whitesnake soundtrack was all it took to get my teen hormones going!Musically, I still love every track on this album. Still of the Night is a classic! Is this Love is a track even my wife loves and Here I go again is one of THE rock anthems of all times! I have been known to play this track over and over again.This album and Slip of the Tongue are the epitome of late eighties flashy rock'n'roll. Big hair, flashy clothes, screamin' guitar solos and politically incorrect lyrics.That's why this album gets a big, fat FIVE from me!"
1,WOW.....,"How bad is this. During the late 80s the whole big hair thing and ballad thing was the new and everyone loved it. Whitesnake compared too great bands of that era(metallica or guns n roses), is nothing compared too them. Sure they wrote Here I Go Again but all that is is just another power ballad that was so over used that era. Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album? come on. Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album. It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time. Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts. By far not the greatest album of all time in fact its one of the worse"
1,Unintentionally funny,"When ""Here I Go Again"" comes on the radio, i always end up listening for a few moments just because I am baffled about how bad some songwriting can be. Its hilarious that when you hear a line, you can predict the next one. I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings...he just picked the words cuz it sounds good...to him anyway.In the Still of the Night is no better. The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem. Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards some rock zenith ...but when you hear the lyrics....all they are saying is ""Im horny...gimme some"". Hey, Im not opposed to songs about sex, but give me a break, dont pretend like you're telling me something brilliant.All in all, Whitesnake is exactly what Spinal Tap was making fun of. I bet Whitesnake didnt even get the joke."
3,"Most popular 'Snake, but not the best....","Whitesnake finally hit paydirt in '87 with the release of their eponymous titled album. This album has sold over an amazing 10 million copies in the last 11 years! Unfortunately, for anyone familiar with earlier blues-rooted Whitesnake, this album serves as a reminder of a dispointing sell-out. Coverdale seemed more interested in coping chics than making well-constructed tunes with this album. Although ""Still of the Night"" and ""Crying in the Rain"" serve as powerful hard rock anthems, the rest of the album contains deflated balladry in ""Is This Love"" and ""Don't Turn Away"" and hair metal cliches with ""Bad Boys"" and ""Children of the Night."" Of course, we are all used to bad lyrics from Coverdale (the man has a one track mind). This sits on the shelf most of the time, outplayed easily by ""Slide It In"" and ""Ready an' Willing."""
2,Better on the radio,"With songs like ""Still of the Night,"" ""Here I Go Again,"" and ""Don't Turn Away"" I figured this album would be one awesome album. Every song seems to be the same, all about love, but for some strange reason it only works on the above songs. The other 6 songs on the album are decent enough to listen to but they just don't rock.1 great song, 2 good songs, and 6 mediocre songs do not = a good album."
1,Are you serious?,"To be honest I have not listened to the remaster of this album. I am sure it will be top notch. But the fact that the Extra DVD features only videoclips and live renditions already included on a previously released DVD which, in turn, belongs to a recent tour and not the actual ""1987"" tour, is a bit of a disappointment. In this kind of reissues you would expect something from the same era of the album, just like what Def Leppard did in the Deluxe Edition of ""Pyromania"", and the extra CD with the entire live show of 1983 in LA off the ""Pyromania"" tour."
2,worst compilation,"There is nothing wrong with each individual song, but the person who arranged this compilation doesn't understand that a CD is for listening. The old Original Modern Lovers songs in demo-quality on this CD spoil the listening of the other tracks.It's the worst Jonathan Richman compilation ever!If you like the old live tracks, you can choose between 2 live CD's, but first listen to the album ""Modern Lovers""."
2,Not what I expected: Beware The Size,"While this is a nice little book, and I do mean little, it is only a superficial overview of Art Deco ceramics.The book covers 38 artists/studios for the period. You'll get a brief, and I do mean brief, history of each artist. Additionally, you'll see a tiny, and I do mean... well, you get the idea ... a tiny photo of only ONE piece by each studio is shown."
2,Don't quit your day job...,"As managing editor of Hi Society magazine, Freeman must be used to writing a lot of stuff that never actually gets read. This should be on that list..."
2,"Narrow, mean-spirited, begging for attention","This author certainly wanted to gain attention andperhaps create a reputation as an enfant terrible amongjazz writers. He makes some stupid claims, attacks otherwriters and muscians, and seems to think all of the recordingsmade by the musicians he profiles are worth owning.Matthew Shipp better than Cecil Taylor?Derek Bailey's palying sounds autistic?Please.Plus, he seems to be kissing up to Ware, Parker, Shipp,and company in much the same way he criticizes other jazzwriters."

3,Not that good,"I tend to like these movies, but I was not particularly impressed with this one. The acting fighting scenes are very good. The story needed some work as does the casting. I think Michelle Yeoh, is too old for this role.The filming is good.Overall John Woo, I think has done better. So even although I tend to like these movies, this one was not particularly impressed with this one. The acting fighting scenes are very good.Overall considering who directed the film and who played in it, I thought it was not that good."
3,"Not What I Expected,,,But...","This isn't a ""wow"" film. Don't expect anything close to the more ""popular"" wushu films of recent years. It does have it's moments and the fight choreography is decent if not ""impressive"" in areas. I gave it 3 stars for not being a total ""flop""."
1,Make sure you get what you ordered!,"The product pictured is the authentic Region-3 DVD from Hong Kong. It ships in a nice slipcase and is from Mega Star. The product I received is a cheap bootleg with terrible video and audio that came in a cheesy broken case with poor photocopied artwork. It also didn't have the ""making of"" documentary the authentic DVD was supposed to have."
4,A tale from Eric Berne,I'm a psychologist and I adopt the transactional analysis.I was intrigued by the fact that Eric Berne had written a story for children.At first reading the book seems mazy and a bit strange but hides a very thin sense.Very nice.
1,horrrid,"I read a loving encomium to this book in J. Peder Zane's REMARKABLE READS, and it was enough to prod me to get a copy.Alas! It's drivel.Written by an early pop psychologist in the heydey of the 1960's, this kids' book follows the adventures of the slow-witted python, Shardlu.Unfortunately, there's too many characters, the action is confusing, the switching between English and ""Ruthenian"" is disorienting, and the pictures only obliquely illustrate the action.No wonder this quickly went out of print and stayed there."
4,American treasures both,"From Carpenter's youthful Schubertian Sonata with a glorious Adagio,to his kaleidoscopic ""Diversions"", to the lilting ""Nocturne"", to the Impressionistic , blues-tinged ""Impromptu"", these are pieces well worth repeated hearings, played lovingly and devotedly by the late Denver Oldham. Oldham died in May of 2012, an American pianist who deserved to be better known, who championed American composers.Good cd sound.At the used prices here,a must for pianophiles."
1,shockingly bad,"You wonder how anyone could yell ""that's a print"" from the Director's chair.Very stilted sophomoric dialogue; or rather, had the lines been delivered as an actual 'real-live character' might have delivered them, it could have rolled along, rather than clunk-clunk-clunk like a car driving on its rims."
1,very educational,"This is more of an educational movie more than anything, About what drugs can do to you. No for me personally this movie is definately not a keeper."
4,Get the Get-Outs!,"What a pleasant surprise! The All Music Guide listed these guys as ""third generation punks,"" but to my ears, vocally and melodically, they're a slightly more aggressive Supergrass circa ""I Should Coco."" Also similarly, the musicianship is very tight. At least 10 of the 13 tracks are absolute ""keepers,"" which these days is a pretty good trick. I often buy something, only to find only one or two tracks are worth repeated plays. This is one of those albums where you don't have to listen to the lyrics (which kind of fly by) to enjoy the tunes pumping out of your stereo. I'm looking forward to see what they come up with next - Hopefully they will remain open to musical growth as the above-mentioned Supergrass did, and just get even better with time, and definitively move past the ""punk"" tag that I've seen mentioned a few times in various reviews. If you like high energy rock with memorable hooks and choruses, go for it - you won't regret it."
4,Fascinating,Fascinating and informative documentary about a very unique multitalented artist. Focus on the making of opera The Nose was especially interesting to me since I worked in it.
1,Not worth 2 cents,"This book may have been trendy in the 1950's, but it's way out of touch today and it never was based on any facts. It infers that all women are not employed, have few interests in life and are limited in their thinking ability. I don't know how or why the author's wife could have let him write or publish such un-informed, biased rubbish. According to Dr Dobson, women wait all day for their man to return home from thier business lives and take them to cocktail parites and men should be considerate of how limited their thinking is. Judge that for yourself."
2,For Conservative Christians only,"Once again a conservative minister with traditional views thinks women needed a man to not only think FOR them...but to tell us what WE are actually thinking!!!!! If you want to know what wives wish their husbands knew, ask a real wife. If you want to enhance your traditional conservative marriage, this book is for you. Otherwise, not good for modern couples"
1,Silly claptrap,"Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit."
3,The French Foreign Legions Missing Men,"P.C. Wren is the author of the excellent Beau Geste. These stories do not reach the heights of Beau Geste but they are very good none the less and although some of the themes seem familiar, these stories were published in 1934 and thus may be the originals.All the stories revolve around soldiers of the French Foreign Legion, a military organization to which Wren belonged.The stories revolve around love, loss of love and death by murder, bravery and hard drinking. The stories all have a twist which Alfred H. would have enjoyed."
4,A Family Place,Leila's story fits for many New Englander's and upstate NYer's. Makes you think about researching those odd items in the family closet and the vague stories Aunt Ada told you. Also makes me want to go prune the apple trees come spring!
2,fit not comfortable,my foot kept sliding to the front and I would have to really tighten the ankle strap to prevent that.
2,OAKLAND '79 not GABON '80,"True to form, japanese Wailers' bootlegs are mislabeled and edited. This particular show is sweet, sweet, sweet and was performed in Oakland, CA 11.30.79 not Gabon. Positive Vibration (opening song), Natty Dread, Get Up Stand Up (closing tracks) have been omitted. Marley vocals have a delay(aaay-aay-ay) on various notes/words. Sweet, Sweet, Sweet! However, this recording is presented at a much faster tempo than was actually performed. Suggest you invest the effort in finding online ""Marley traders"" who can do justice to the spirit of the Wailers and provide the real deal sans pecuniary pursuit. Seen?"
4,Heady Stuff,"This is really a very remarkable CD, especially for the first two items. Otto Mueller carves out the In Praise of Shahn from musical granite. There is a heady and severe coldness to the music which is masterful and invigorating. It doesn't remind me of Ben Shahn's art very much at all -- it seems cut from the same cloth as Schuman's Eighth symphony -- but maybe it is like Shahn's uncompromising intellectual stance in matters political. The Copland Connotations is projected with a kind of outrageous breadth for such, to my ears, genius miserliness in late Copland's music. In a way this is the same Copland of the Piano Variations and Piano Fantasy, But it is pared down. Sixten Ehrling's reading hits the aesthetic bulls-eye for this more spare, but somehow still unavoidably romantic music. I believe that Bernstein premiered the piece, and though I have never heard his performance of it, if such exists, I am quite sure I would not like it nearly as much."
1,Not worth any price,"I tried to save money by ordering these but they are terrible. Size 6 is really like size 4, they often rip, never stay closed and are useless for holding any fluid. Total waste of money; spend a few more dollars for the name brands, or 7th generation."
2,well...,not so happy. I've had no word on the whereabouts of this purchase and do not know when or if I will receive it. like I said not so happy right now.
1,Save Your Money!,"When it worked, it did catch mosquitos. The problem is that this unit has a very limited lifespan. Ours worked sporadically for two summers until failing this year. Beware that there is only a limited 1 year warranty. After that the only option the manufacturer offers is $500 for refurbishing. I'll leave judgement of how fair this is to you. We paid $795 for two summers worth of work -- please don't repeat our mistake!"
2,Mine died too!,"I set it up late summer 2002, and then early spring 2003. It basically solved my mosquito problem that year.In 2004, it would not start. Their support had me try two things and then explained it was dead. They offered no repair option, only a discount on a new one (same discount they were offering new customers).Summer 2004 was ""forecasted"" to be a bad year for mosquitos in Massachussettes, but I must say that even without the MM running, my mosquitos weren't too bad. I attributed this to it's success wiping out the population the previous summer. But who really knows...I didn't know others had this reliability problem until I came here looking for a new one.Mine was not the factory refurbished one, but it was the same model pictured above. New in late summer 2002."
1,Big Quality Control issues -Cheap!,I bought two and sent one back because it leaked hot water out of the handle when I turned on the cold water...this unit is band new. The second one has a problem with the body separating from the upper and lower parts and there doesn't seem to be a screw or something to tighten it order to bring them back together. The water supply hoses on this unit are really really thin...not sure how long it's going to last before there is a blow out.
2,Handles Start to Stick after a Few Years - Even with Good Water Source,"We liked this faucet very much until the handles started to stick 4 years after they were installed (great water, Chicago). There is no way to disassemble them to lubricate / oil the friction joints.... so... looks like we're going to have to buy a new faucet."
3,Just okay.,I purchased this book thinking that it would be as good as her other books. It was just okay. I found Gerald to be a spoiled brat. Priss should have left him alone a long time ago but he was an ends to a means. I wouldn't buy this book. Wait until it's in the library. I will be donating it soon.
4,A Precious Jewel,"Quite a different plot from Mary Balogh than usual. But still very good.The hero was an awkward man who didn't know what he was feeling. The heroine was a woman with a damaged past, who falls in love with the hero and is afraid that he does not feel the same. It was really cute to read about him trying to figure out how he felt and trying to tell the woman he loves that he is in love with her and wants to marry her. It was emotional at times, and a tad bit slow at others. But it really built the tension and mood in the story."
2,Precious Waste of Time,"I grabbed this book because I've loved so many other books by Mary Balogh. This one though was a disappointing slog. The out-of-touch hero annoyed the crap out of me, and the passive courtesan was depressing. Generally I like Regency romances that are set in different circumstances (once you've read about Almack's 85 times do we really have to go again?), but these characters just left me cold."
1,Very disappointing,"I'm a big Mary Balogh fan, but I hated this book. She tried to break out of the typical romance mold by having awkward characters. Perhaps her goal was to make them more normal. Romance reading is about fantasy, however, and Ms. Balogh's plain-looking, unintelligent and bad in bed ""hero"" was as boring to read about as he would have been to know in real life. Who is really interested in reading about a guy who repeatedly just wants a woman to lie passively in bed while he has his way in under 5 minutes? He was also not very bright and the far smarter prostitute heroine had to hide her own intelligence from him. There's a reason the usual romance formula works and I suggest Ms. Balogh return to it. In the meantime, skip this book."
5,A Precious Jewel,"It takes a specially enlightened and kind writer to develop a protagonist who is a ""fallen"" woman. I have found this sensitivity in all the books that Mary Balogh writes. I always look forward to seeing she has written another story. Some of my favorite gifts to friends and family are Mary's books. Bravo, Mary!"
5,Best Mary Balogh ever!,"This is my favorite of all Mary Balogh's romances. I couldn't put it down the first time I read it, and I've now reread it so many times I've lost count!"
2,"Love Mary Balogh, but didn't like this book","This story is a reprint of one of Ms. Balogh's first novels. I just simply didn't like it and I am a fan of her work. To be honest, I just didn't care about the characters. However, I will give her credit that this story is highly unorthodox for your typical regency romance. The heroine is a prostitute-turned-mistress and you do sympathize with her as the story unfolds. And I did like how the hero finally lets down his guard as his feelings for Prissy evolve."
1,Ugh,"I've read a few of Mary Balogh's books and I have to say that this is the first one that I've been really disappointed in. Neither the hero nor heroine were very memorable (I've even forgotten their names). The hero was very selfish and obviously didn't really care about what the heroines needs were. It seemed like she was more of a convenient afterthought than anything else. I also didn't appreciate how easily she fell in love with him as he was really boring and pretty self-centered. All in all, I'm surprised that I even bothered to finish reading it."
5,Only Mary could have written this book. deserves 10 stars,This is one of my all time favorite books that Mary wrote. Only she could write a story and make the heroine a working prostitute and make it believable. Prissy is what I like to referr to as a bloom where you are planted person. Inspite of the ugliness of what she did. She was able to keep a part her that was her own.
1,Hero is SO dim,"This is by far my least favorite of the Mary Balogh's books. I'm glad that it is a reprint of an older edition or I'd be wondering if she's losing her touch. The hero is truly dim, and the words he say to the heroine are always hurtful and appallingly repetitve, ""You are a good girl... You have pleased me..."" over and over again. The problem I have with the book is not simply that the hero is weak, but that there is nothing convincing me whatsoever of why the heroine would fall in love with him. He has almost no redeeming quality. He is not bright, nor handsome, nor good in bed. And when the heroine decides to leave him, it is not really clear why she did not tell him the real reason behind her leaving. I expect more of Mary Balogh's books, more from a heroine who could have so much more but settled for so much less. The whole story of her turning to prostitution is sordid and not a good excuse at all. So unlike all the other MB books, I don't think I'll be rereading this."
2,Doesn't Seem to Have Aged Well,"I decided this give this book a shot since Mary Balogh's earlier works are far superior to her latest entries.I suppose in its day this book was quite daring, utilizing a fallen gentle lady and a beta male. But it no long has the advantage of novelty and must be judged on its on merits - which are sorely lacking in one area. One can quibble that Balogh's characterizations in this book violate Regency canon but that is not my issue - one can make a tale about a trained monkey fascinating if one has the talent. Where Balogh failed is where she normally is strong, in her writing skill. This book was incredibly clumsy and heavy handed in style, particularly in its repetitious use of phrases. There are authors who can get away with this literary glossolalia but it takes a deft hand.Balogh wrote this as if she figuratively was weighted down with an iron glove."
1,Yuck!,"this is the first Mary Balogh book i picked up, it will be the last! i could not even read through the whole thing.i was so mad... what a crapola hero and beyond submissive female. just lay there and don't move for sex? beyond selfish. he needed a prissish wife then, not a mistress...yuck!i could not take this."
4,Nice,Korkers Sportsman Series Cross Current Wading BootJust got the shoes today they are great. Easy to change bottoms with a little practice.
2,Lock against honest people,"Pros: Looks solid for a cable lock. Fairly light. Combination, so no keys to lug around. Attaches well to bike.Cons: Lost my $[...] bike thanks to it (my bad, I'll admit, for using such a crummy lock). No good in an area with professional bike thieves. Only works to prevent people from ""borrowing"" your cheap bike for a quick ride somewhere."
5,BUY THIS BIKE LOCK,What all of the rest of the reviews say are correct. This thing is amazing. LOVE IT! No Problems with it what so ever. Noone will ever be stealing my bike!
3,Alcatraz lock,"This lock was easy to mount on the bike and seems to be very strong. In fact the cable is so heavy that you have to wrestle it in place around your bike. I wouldn't recommend it for kids. Also, when mounted in the lock holder, the leftmost tumbler won't turn - not a big issue, but annoying."
4,A problem,"I have a problem with the cable, when i bought it i changed the combination and i can't remenber the new one so i want to know if i can change de combination again and how i can do this"
4,underrated bluesman,"Recorded in 1975, this is a great set of acoustic songs (with electric bass on a couple), mostly Shines originals, with a couple from Robert Johnson and Louisiana Red. ""Traveling Back Home"" is actually Shines' interpretation of Johnson's ""Walking Blues,"" but that's okay: the two of them travelled and hung out together way back when. Johnson's ""They're Red Hot"" is called ""Hot Tamale"" here, and that's okay too. Shines begins the song with a spoken tribute to Johnson, and then launches into an top notch acoustic version.Shines was an outstanding but very underrated guitar player, and his technique shines on this album (pun intended). Just listen to his picking and slide on ""Moaning the Blues,"" ""The Wind is Blowing"" and ""Trouble's All I See."" Sugar Blue supplies some sympathetic harmonica on several songs.A wonderful album by one of the lesser-known bluesmen."
5,"Finally, a relationship book that is realistic!","Daylle's book is gold to those of us who make the mistake of idealizing any man who says and does the right thing. She offers no ""tricks"" or ""games"" but instead provides empowering advice and true-to-life insight that gives a woman more power in her relationships. Since I've read this book, I've changed my whole approach to dating, and as a result I'm not dating losers anymore. I'm taking the time to find a good man -- spending the alone time in between dates being WONDERFUL to myself and filling my life with my friends and other interests -- and as a relationship develops, I'm much, much smarter in what to look for and listen for. Daylle's advice is priceless, the first true useful relationship book I've read....and I've read them all! I'm recommending it to everyone I know, even women in relationships and marriages -- as they too need to navigate the waters of male/female communication."
4,Deja vu,"Just picked up this book last night after a night out with the girls. Ended a jerk type relationship two days before. God, I see so much of myself and my friends in this book. It's illluminating and no, it's not male bashing. It's actually showing me the symptoms, causes, and how I can choose to react. I'm in the middle of the book but will probably finish it tonight. There are some insights here. Probably things we already know but haven't wanted to acknowledge. Hope I can apply what I've learned."
1,Are there minus points for this book??,This book is for women who think everything is the man's doing and fault..women who think in typicals instead of for themselves...the way women have bought into their socialization.. I'm not surprized this book was written.... look in the mirror...maybe the person hurting you is yourself...bad choices maybe??? Daaaaa the book wasn't worth recycled paper.... fireplace material..
5,RAY GUN FUN!,"Mars Attacks had what I consider to be one of the BEST toy lines. This gun has not only three different ray gun sound effects, but you can change the pitch. The brain moves too (however, your batteries have to be REALLY fresh).I should warn you, it's not going to take a beating. I broke the antenna off my original, and the pitch knob eventually broke. So, play nice with it.Also, if you are buying this gun now, the manufacturer put batteries in them so you could test them in the store. That was in 1996. Imagine what happens when you buy this gun NOW and open the battery compartment? Good news: add a small amount of water to some baking soda, scrub that compartment with a used toothbrush, and ACK ACK! It still works!"
4,An inspiration to the young and old,I was amazed at the wording of this book. I am so proud of Ms. Irma. The book was inspiring to young women who get pregnant before marriage and are going through a tribulation of being raped; something that is out of their control. It allowed young women to see the positive of adoption and the various options that women have. It showed how a family unites and doesn't allow obstacles to separate them.
4,Be encouraged,"Being a reader, I have read many spiritual books. Ms. Clark's words were very encouraging to me and each page kept me uplifted and craving for more. Ms. Clark did an outstanding job on this novel and I feel in love with the characters, and want to keep up with how there lives are now. There is room for more. This book is definently a book to be read more than once, and I am thankful that I bought a copy, hopefully we don't have to wait to long to read more writings from such a great writer, this book has not only been encouraging but also an inspiration to me in many ways. All I can say is keep it coming..."
4,Mosquito Magnet works great.,"I have used my Mosquito magnet for 3 years now and it works great. I does attract bugs so you won't want to set up your bar-b-que next to it, but if you let it run for a month or so, you will see a big difference in the mosquito numbers. It works as advertised, but it won't work overnight. I have used it with Octenol and without, the Octenol really makes it work better. The Octenol in the bottom of my old electric bug zapper makes it really fry the mosquitos!"
1,Be Careful,BE CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING THIS ITEM. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT TYPE OF MOSQUITO ATTRACTANT IS USED FOR THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE US BUT IT IS NOT OCTENOL. AS STATED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MOSQUITO MAGNET.. OCTENOL IS FOR THE NORTHERN STATES AND THERE IS ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR THE SOUTHERN STATES. I PURCHASED BOTH THE MOSQUITO MAGNET AND THE 3-PACK AND NOT VERY IMPRESSED IN THE RESULTS. MAYBE 100 MOSQUITOS IN 1 MONTH WITH 2 COMPLETE PROPANE TANKS. GIVEN THAT I PAID $250.00 FOR THE MAGNET AND ANOTHER $25.00 FOR THE ATTRACTANT AND ANOTHER $40.00 FOR PROPANE.. YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE FOR ONLY 100 MOSQUITOS. I AM SURE THAT THE MACHINE WORKS GREAT IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS BUT I AM VERY UPSET THAT AMAZON.COM WILL NOT TAKE THE MACHINE BACK DUE TO THE PROPANE USE. THIS IS NOT MENTIONED ANYWERE IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION THAT THE UNIT IS NOT RETURNABLE. GOOD LUCK
1,Mosquito magnet is a waste of a lot of money,I bought the mosquito magnet less than 1 year ago and the gas line has been eaten by squirrels...not covered in the warranty and costs $130!!! Don't buy this if you have any mammals in your yard. It didn't even get rid of the mosqitoes when it WAS working.
3,octenol for mosquito magnet,"does not seem to make any significant difference, in other words, we caught as many mosquitoes without the Octenol as we did using it."
4,Mosquito Magnet attractant,The device works fairly well. The price at this supplier was quite a bit less expensive than the local store. Will buy again
2,Not happy with this product,"This is about the Mosquito Magnet machine, itself.I've owned several Mosquito Magnets in NY and FL.I found them to be expensive and undependable."
4,"Not immediate, but yet effective","I have been using my mosquito magnet for about 18 months now. It matches the advertising and is effective as promised. It has significantly reduced the mosquito population in my back yard. It did take some time as promised to kill them off, but I can really tell the difference from one side of the yard (where the mosquito magnet is located by my deck) to the other. Keep in mind that this thing promises at best a 1 acre coverage and my yard is 2 1/2."
4,Mosquitos are history,"We bought the smaller model of the mosquito magnet. We installed it out by our pool somewhat in the woods. There is a running stream in the spring and in the summer it stays wet, but not running, the mosquitos used to be unbearable by 8:00 pm. Now we are able to stay out and sit by the pool all night without a problem. It was a great purchase."
5,No complaints,I have ordered from this company before and have been pleased with their service and prices.Will order again.les gibson
3,"Not bad, just not very good","Not a bad premise, essentially, but the whole thing felt rather slight and I found the device of Dracula's recorded memories to be contrived. The idea of linking Dracula to the Borgias was interesting enough, but it never felt like it became fully fleshed out enough. It was good enough to encourage me to read other books in the Dracula series to see if I find them better than this."
5,Goodman with great players,"This is the best Goodman collection available. Some of the greatest musicians & vocalists of all time are in the band (orchestra?)playing and singingsome of the finest swing jazz pieces ever written, arranged as only Goodman could."
1,The music this toy make is OBNOXIOUS!!,"That is no exaggeration. My 17 month old loves the lights, can easily turn it on, overall just thinks it's really cool. But I had to take it away from him. The second button starts this music, and it is loud and very annoying. And it doesn't stop until you press the button again. Believe me, I am not easily annoyed by loud toys, but I hate this thing!! I'm trying to get my husband to take it apart and see if he can disconnect the music, then I will love this toy!!"
1,poorly built,"I got one, it didn't work right out of the package, so returned it and got another. The second one worked for maybe 5 minutes and wasn't dropped or anything like that. A friend of my daughters has had one awhile with no problems so who knows, but I am not giving it another chance."
1,"fun idea, but poorly constructed","I bought this toy for my daughter, but the globe broke as my husband was taking out of the box. That one went back to the store. So, when I exchanged it none of them on display worked. I took a chance and picked one out. Once I got home and put new batteries in it, I discovered the music didn't play. Maybe that is a blessing in disguise? (it isn't loud and obnoxious). Normally I would just return it, but it is the holiday season and I don't feel like braving the crowds again. I just hope this one lasts for awhile. I do not recommend this toy."
3,Informative book for retirees who want to go to Mexico,"Living in Mexico provides a lot of information for retirees. They also have a lot of interesting history and cultural info. I found the section on visas, money, and services to be helpful but rather brief. Also includes a brief review of several cities."
1,Good title/bad book,"Never judge a book by its cover! While this book has a good title, it's also misleading. The information is either scant or simply obsolete. There are better books about living in Mexico written by better writers."
1,The Not So Complete Guide,"Zamba's information is too brief to provide much guidance to anyone serious about relocating. But even more important to note is that this book was published in 1991, so all statistics and facts are nine years out of date. There are far better books at Amazon than this."
3,Thinking Of You - upbeat version ???,"Glad to see others remember the upbeat version of ""Thinking Of You"" that was played on the radio in the early 70's. I loved that version and would love to be informed in the case anyone ever discovers it."
2,More Sony Garbage,"I don't ask much of my remastering peers, but when Sony allows distortion to be added, maybe from an old analog mixing console, I become annoyed. Nothing severe, mind you, but if you want perfect sound, stay away from this CD (I found mine in a local budget bin). At a minimum, on my favorite song, Your Mama Don't Dance, I hear added distortion and other abnormalities. Shame on Sony for hiring amateurs."
5,Loggins & Messina's Second Great CD In A Row,"Loggins & Messina's second, self-titled, CD is also their second great one in a row. As on the first one, they sound at times like a softer-edged Poco and at other times, such as on the jam-rocker ""Angry Eyes"", like a softer, folk-based version of the Allman Brothers Band's EAT A PEACH or BROTHERS AND SISTERS. Either way, there are numerous great songs here, and very few, if any, low points. The duo would never, with the exception of the live ON STAGE album and THE BEST OF: SITTIN' IN AGAIN, be this consistent again."
5,Thinking of you,"In the 70's for radio airplay, there was an upbeat single version of the song ""Thinking of you."" Can anyone tell me where it can be found? You'd think it would be included somewhere in their ""Best of"" albums.....at the very least a bonus track."
2,Disappointed..had to return it.,The surface was not smooth. It had pitted spots on it. Had to return it. Not good quality 18/10. Could have done better at Bed Bath and Beyond or and Estate sale. Sorry.
3,good trip hop/downtempo,"I just saw these guys last night at the montreal jazzfest. Interesting album, great production. Check them out if you have the chance..."
3,Disappointing,"I was so disappionted with this book.I expected a more intreging mystery,and I got almost zilch!Don't read this book unless you have an unsually long attention span.(a VERY long attention span,considering that I have a very LONG one too)The only interesting thing about this book is that the Kirse(good guys,I think)fruit is Adirrim(bad guys)LSD."
3,What I've come to expect.,It was a good book to loose myself in after a number of more difficult books. The story lines are always good and fitting with the franchise. Never missed an episode and will get through the books the same.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A pretty ordinary Star Trek Voyager tie-in story. The crew of the Voyager are hungry, and need to get supplies, given that they are, as usual, stuck on a ship in the middle of nowhere.This story deals with having to go to a planet to get food, and, the boss leads the expedition, because the boss always goes shopping, don't they?"
2,If you like descriptions of vegetables...,"...then hey, this book was written just for you! Otherwise... it's just too thick with description; it's a struggle just to finish some of the pages. While I realize that ""finding foodstuffs"" could be a real dilemma in the Delta Quadrant, the show never gives this a second thought; so, a novel that's based entirely around ""Away Team searches for edible plants"" is not going to be very compelling. No, nothing stands out as ""out-of-character,"" but at the same time, just about anybody could say these lines the same way--even a non-Trek character. Please do *not* make this your first VOY novel, and if you already have, please do *not* rate the whole series of novels based on this one! There are many better ones out there!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!,"THIS IS NOT A BOX SET OR MOVIE OF THE CBS #1 SHOW!!! If you look at the larger image of the box, you will see that it says ""Grave Digger"". ""Grave Digger"" was the last episode in Season 5 that had 2 parts. The descripition above is completely misleading and doesn't say a thing about what this really is. Hope that this helps!!"
2,"Supposedly good brand, but the slides are anything but good...","Uncomfortable- blisters after a week wearing them in...Got tired of the pain and poor look of my feet due to their poor quality. The leather is patent (not genuine) and they make an unpleasant sound/squeak at each step when your feet get a bit warmer or sweatier (normal during summer). Although heel is tiny, I feel unstable..."
5,Lovin' these shoes so much I bought them in black!,"The most comfortable pair of little heels/sandals a gal could ask for! I LOVE them!!! I can dress them up or down, and the best part is I can walk all day and night in them... ahhhh!"
1,Poor Quality/Warranty,"After we have had this TV at about a year and a half, it developed a 2 inch wide transparent green stripe that runs from top to bottom (vertically). Took it to a repair shop and said it would cost appx $200 to repair. I can buy a new TV for that and obviously at that point it is out of warranty. Buyer beware!"
5,An excellent book on approximation theory,"An excellent, graduate level, reference book on approximation theory.Different aspects of relations between constructive and structural properties of functions studied."
2,"Like Napster, it should have been great but it failed","I'd looked forward to reading this book but whilst it was fun in parts, the inaccuracies and wild assumptions coupled with only a superficial grasp of the real events which led to Napster's demise meant it fell drastically short of it's goal. There are some serious journalistic errors with regard to key players which show lack of research and too much reliance on hearsay and supposition."
5,Good description of napster story,"This was a good and entertaining book about what happened with Napster, including some details that I haven't seen elsewhere in print.A couple of quibbles. When the author refers to ""Fanning"" in the book, he means John Fanning, not Shawn. This seems weird to me, given that Shawn Fanning's name is in the subtitle of the book.And Unix is an operating system, not a programming language."
1,"Unbelievably inaccurate, sloppy reporting","As someone who actually worked at Napster, I think I am in a position to say that this book is way off. I won't take issue with Menn's choice of whom to champion and whom to vilify in the Napster crew; however the reams of factual errors betray his inability to reach a wide number of inside sources and his complete ignorance of the music industry. Let's just say that he refers to a very senior female head of a record label as ""he"", and has his dates and players completely wrong with regards to the Bertelsmann investment in Napster - a very important chapter in the company's history. Menn also fails to examine in detail the actual demise and eventual bankruptcy of the company, preferring instead to dwell on the ""wacky hijinks"" of a bunch of young programmers. THAT story is nothing new. It happened at every startup. I found this book badly written and way off the mark."
1,undistinguished-lightweight-establishment-BLAH,"Tried hard to finish this, but couldn't. This is significant because I hate wasting money - and therefore, usually slough through to the finish on even the most unbearable works. But here in Jo Menn's ""All The Rave"" I found it was everything BUT Interesting and had to throw in the towel after the first 100 pages.Primarily, this book just bored me to death. The prose is written like a long newspaper article and worse still, the storyline delivers nothing but whining. Incessant whining. Nearly every character tortures you with their pleas for a scapegoat; the ""WHY"" this $100 million project ended up on the scrapheap can be simply put. Summary Judgement."
3,Daughters of Eve-esque,"Ever read Daughters of Eve in jr high? This reminded me of that but for adults. I really enjoyed the shift in narrator (each chaper written by 1 of 3 characters) but it was somewhat predictable. Still, I couldn't put it down when I was reading it and would suggest it to friends. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could and would suggest it for a good, anst-y read."
3,author tries to hard,"Not a horrible book but obviously not written by a seasoned author either. The story itself relies on drama and whacked out characters; dysfunction in general. I agree with many reviews that the ""event"" that tore the 3 girls of the ""bitch posse"" apart forever was not revealed until the very end and at that point it lost most of the potential impact and drama it could have and should have had. A very flawed book, but entertaining nonetheless. I would not recommend it however, I'm not inclined to bash it either."
3,Eh,"I have mixed feelings about this one. The storyline was interesting and it kept my attention throughout; but it took way way way too long to get to ""what happened that night at Porter Place."" The entire book is flashbacks between the three members of ""The Bitch Posse"" as they were as seniors in high school, and currently--at the age of 32. We know that the friends no longer talk to each other since ""the night."" We also know that all of them have been deeply affected by the outcome of that one spring night. It's pretty easy to figure it out, but it was immensely frustrating that O'Connor would allude and allude and allude to the events and then wait until the last few pages to reveal. By then it not only wasn't shocking, it was more like ""I waited this long for that?"" I just felt let down by the end. Too much foreshadowing and teasing had the effect of ""who cares."""
1,"Trying too hard not to be ""chick lit""","Just plain ugly. The author is so determined to write a book about women without being considered ""chick lit"" that she set out to alienate most women who are intelligent enough to read--and men too, I am sure. Who wants to read about these disgusting, disturbed characters? Who cares about their dark, twisted world? Is there a point?"
1,JK Rowling meets Jackie Collins?,"As a parent, I am a bit mystified by this book. On the one hand it seems to be aimed at teenage girls - the marketing, the themes of intense friendships and the general plotting/literary style. On the other hand, the unimaginatively crude language and adult themes make me really question as to whether an adolescent girl is realy going to appreciate the repetitive descriptions of semen oozing, oral sex and drug abuse. Maybe it's me who is out of touch with the chick sub-culture but I found the characters unsympathetic and the final outcome dull. Give me Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty anytime."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"I picked up this book because the blurb on the back compared the author to Donna Tartt, one of my favorite writers. Imagine my disappointment when I began reading a book that should instead have been compared to one written by Judith Krantz or Jackie Collins! If you like these authors, you will love this book! It was too much of a soap opera for me."
1,Do Not Buy.,"I'm usually one who enjoys a book that centers on a deep meaningful subject, but this one missed the mark. I have never been so disappointed in an ending in my entire life. And I don't mean the actual story ending (which lacked anything special as well) but the last pages of supposed empowering quotes. No book tells someone to make cut until it bleeds and don't stop until it hurts whether literal or figurative.I actually finished this book in the hopes that all the chapters would eventually mold into one powerful story centered around the bonds of friendship. Don't get me wrong, I can handle difficult subject manner, but only when it is written well and with meaning. This book was an author's sorry attempt to change the face of real life, hardcore, female literature...I burned this book after I read it."
1,I couldn't finish it. It's too dark and depressing.,"With all apologies to Martha O'Connor (with whom I'm familiar through an online writing group), I just couldn't finish this book. It was too profane, too depressing, and too much for me."
5,Excellent,"For me, the title of this book suggested a light-hearted fun read. However, The Bitch Posse is so much more. The reader is instantly pulled into the turbulent teenage lives of high school seniors: Amy, Cherry, and Rennie. Each girl is coping with family life issues that one would hope an average teen would never have to deal with. It's a raw and gritty coming of age tale.There's a lot to make you grimace while reading this book. For example, there's a scene where the threesome pledge their allegiance to the friendship by cutting their arms and drawing blood and then mixing the blood in a jar.A dreadful event and secret shatters the friendship. The reader is taken on a journey that goes back and forth from the self-proclaimed Bitch Posse's senior year in high school until the young women are in their thirties. There's no fairy tale ending in this book. It's all raw, in your face, and real. I loved it."
2,jeeze...,"A lot of really intense things go on in these girl's lives so you'd think this book would be good. I kept waiting for the book to get past the begining explanation hump and get into the story, but it seemed like the whole book was just getting started... I don't really know how to explain it but I didn't like this book at all. The way the chapters went were interesting and technique was pretty cool, but that's the only good thing about this book."
3,Not sure about this book,"I don't know if I really enjoy this book, I mean it had its moments but it seems to skip around, back and forth to much, I was getting confuse with the characters past and present and found it hard to follow sometimes, the story it self was good but very hard to follow."
1,Too depressing,"I'm not quite sure what I missed with this book, but I just couldn't finish it. There were things I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened and all, but it was so painful for me to read that I just finally gave up on it. It was definitely too depressing and scared me into not wanting to send my daughter to high school. The characters, Rennie, Cherry and Amy, are wild. One has sex with any man who moves, they abuse drugs, drink, swear, smoke, they cut themselves...it's insane. Their parents were just as screwed up as they were and, while concerned that their daughters were going off course, no one seemed to care that they (the parents) might have something to do with it. The most upsetting part was that no one did anything about it (at least not in the first half I read). It became so frustrating.I'm sure this is probably a very good book, it's got great reviews at Amazon, but it just wasn't for me."
2,"Morbidly Entertaining, But a Bad Influence...","I'm sure the title of this book will attract countless impressionable teens and young adults and thereby should have a warning label on it: NOT FOR YOUNG TEENS.Although it was well-written and yes, morbidly entertaining, I'm worried that it will negatively influence young minds. I don't mean to sound prissy, but I'm the mother of two adult daughters and I wouldn't even want them reading this book. The characters' habits of heavy drinking, random violence, smoking cigarettes and marijuana, promiscuous sex and cutting are presented in a way that makes you want to emulate them.There doesn't seem to be a problem the bitch posse encounters that can't be soothed with one of the above bad habits, not to mention snorting cocaine.I believe the author tries to redeem her characters at the end, but it's much too little, much too late for this reader."
2,Horrible.,"I don't have anything against chick lit in the first place, but was intrigued by this book because it is sold as something that is NOT chick lit. What I thought would be a refreshing book about friendship and struggle from a female perspective was just a string of sex, drug and alcohol scenes strung together under the guise of storytelling. The women in this book are self-loathing with no redeeming qualities. But the biggest fault here is Martha O'Connor's for not offering up an ending that at least lets you forgive the three girls for being such idiots.This book is all lead-up and let-down. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone in case you decide to ignore my warning -- just stay away from the book. Trust me, it's a stinker."
5,THE BEST RAZORS FOR LEG SHAVIN'.,"These are the ONLY razors I can use to shave my legs without causing major carnage. In combo with the handle-thingy that you snap them into, it turns into an instrument that doesn't fall apart in your hand while you're using it (unlike some other products that rhyme with Weenus) and really minimizes cuts and promotes a smooth shave. It's hard to find the refill blades, though. I don't know what the deal with the distribution is, so I hoard them. When they stop making them, I better be in a committed relationship with an earth child, because I refuse to slice up my legs. BTW, work really good with just soap and water, I use Jergens bar and it works great."
4,Schick Silk Effects,I have used this product for years. It is great for no cuts and burns. I like the easy refill blades. The spring action helps with contour of legs and under-arms. Also great for girls just starting out. vertually impossible to cut yourself. I highly recommend this raiser.
3,Isn't a perfect fit,"The ""interlocking"" part of the hitch doesn't exactly fit snugly. That's the main reason I bought this item. It works, but seems a bit sloppy of a fit."
3,<3 it but kind of lo-budget,I love the series sooo much but unfortunately at the end it starts getting a bit disappointing.
3,it does the job,three weeks later still trying to clean the glueo from two stikers that came attached to the screen protector
4,A Passionate Surrender by Helen Bianchin,"Description from the book back cover:The marriage seduction! Ana had secretly hoped her marriage of convenience to Luc Dimitriades would turn into the real thing, yet one year after exchanging their vows he still seemed susceptible to the charms of his ex-mistress ... Holding her head high, Ana knew she had to leave. Luc wasn't prepared to let his wife go. In fact, he seemed determined to blackmail her back into his bed! Ana fought to resist his passionate persuasion, but Luc held one last trump card: he knew she was carrying his child ..."
5,This is my all time favorite book,"I can't tell you how wonderful this book is. It offers photos, drawings, history and interviews with the principal personalities involved with some of the most wonderful and some of the most horrible automobiles of all time. Going through this book makes you either crave what was never produced, or better understand why some weren't. References are cited; research and writing is done extremely well. There are witty chapter headings, such as ""The Cars That Couldn't Have Saved Studebaker"" and ""A Case of the Willys"". There are insights into the organizational politics and the artistic techiques that go on in the automotive industry. You also get to peek in on the very individualistic stylists and power/money hungry executives. I've read the book dozens of times, and now I share it with my kids. But the best ting of all is the pictures."
2,Judge Sibelius performances by the Second,"There is obviously something greatly attractive about buying complete symphony sets, in this case the series by Bergund, 1-4 in one box and 5-7 in the second. I purchased both, tempted by the low price. Once I reached the Second Symphony, I knew I would be disappointed and not satisfied until I had purchased otherwise. The Second Symphony is one of the glorious creations of the twentieth century and Bergund's interpretation simply does not do credit to it; the great fourth movement left me cold. So for me, having the whole set of symphonies is now that much less exciting. The standard for the Second Symphony has been set by Barbirolli, first and foremost with the Halle Orchestra and secondly with the Royal Philharmonia. I have the Halle in LP but it appears not to be available on CD. The Royal Philharmonia is."
2,Not Microsoft Friendly,"I liked the concept for this device and actually purchased one for my son for Christmas. However, like another reviewer, I found this device not only NOT windows media player and Microsoft friendly but it ""locked up"" multiple times. And the proprietary music download interface (Musicmatch/Philips) would not load properly (something about an ISScript problem)on my Windows 2000 Advanced Server. I agree that this device is NOT ready for prime time. And why embed only 512 Mb? How about a compact flash slot in this ""big"" baby???"
1,Very annoying! Don't buy it!,"I'll keep it short. (The review is for the 256MB version). One word - Annoying. The fact that Philips FORCED you to use the musicmatch software to load songs is very very annoying. Difficult to use. And as another reviewed said, it doesn't resume. Once stopped, it goes back to the first song. That't annoying too. You'll be better off with just buying a cheap MP3 player and a separate powered mini speaker. Doesn't look as nice but at least it works fine! Really regret buying the Philips!!"
1,can't work,I bought this thing all the way from US and VPOST to send it all the way to me in Malaysia and found out that it doesn't work. It is really frustrating. Now I have to send to out local service centre to repair.
1,PLEASE DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I purchased this mp3 player and I couldn't get it to work. The battery would not charge up.I called Phillips and the representative said I should push the reset button. I did and it still didn't work. I called Phillips five times for the same problem over a four week period. Finally the representative said they would give me a refurbished player. Of course, I am upset because I have never used the item and I don't believe I should have to received a refurished one. If you are thinking about purchasing this item, please think twice. If you have a problem, Phillips WILL NOT help you. I read the negative feedback and I didn't believe them. If you have bought one and it is working, you are very lucky. I would hate to see someone go through what I have been through. They do not care about their consumers. I would give this item 0 stars"
4,Good product,"Good , sounds even better for what it is.easy surf trough the menu. Took it to the beach. Salt air and sand was no problem.left it in the sun for 3 hours nothing happened still playing. battery life Ok after 12 hrs recharge. no problems so far. upload program should be used only to upload otherwise will create some problems."
1,Nightmare -- Don't Buy This Thing,This is a really cute looking device -- too bad it doesn't work at all. The firmware and software combo is horrible. You cannot simply drag and drop songs to the device. You MUST use their Philips branded version of MusicMatch Jukebox to transfer songs and it DOES NOT work. Two phone calls to Philips didn't help either. They were polite and all but otherwise useless. I've owned and used MP3 players since they were first introduced and this is by far the most time I have wasted trying to get something to work. I never did succeed.
5,Avery authentic exposition of Hinduism,"This Austrian author's interest in Hinduism was ignited through some of his readings and that changed the course of his life..visiting India..learning Sanskrit..teaching Philosophy in a University and finally undertaking a 1500 mile journey by foot..seeking mantropadesa for conversion into Hinduism,getting rebuffed by several religious orders..and finally succeeding..it is a fascinating and authentic account of some unknown and important tenets of a way of life called Hinduism."
5,Strange World.......,"This is a very involving book, and well worth it. Absolutelyamazing discussion and pictures of a lost, strange world-theCambrian Explosion, when Nature went wild with designs, such asthe five-eyed, nozzle-nosed opabinia, the elegant marella lace-like crab, and the nightmare Anamolacaris. Perhaps the mostamazing of all, is the tiny pikaia wormlet, which somehow sur-vived and became the ancestor of us all. Preserved in a land-slide, and uplifted to the side of a mountain, these animals aretruly amazing inhabitants of a strange world-the Cambrian Explo-sion."
2,"Great Material, Terrible Treatment","Few stories are more remarkable than that of the Cambrian explosion, and few things are more unlikely than a paleontologist with a philosophical-political axe to grind. Here, somehow, we have both. Poor Dr. Walcott gets kicked while down, being dead, old, white and otherwise unable to defend himself, because this gives Gould the chance to graft his unremarkable ideas onto the story of the deciphering of the Burgess Shale. Aggravating matters is Gould's mannered writing style; part pseudo-literary, part popular and perky, it's like reading something William Morris wrote for TV Guide.Anyone who has any respect for the history of science, with all its wrong turns and dead ends, and for the integrity of paleontology as a apolitical discipline -- and anyone who cares about good science writing -- will trade this book in on a book by Simon Conway Morris, who writes clearly and intelligently on this fascinating topic."
3,Not Good,This book is quoted so often in the literature that I thought I was going to read something profound. It isn't. Conway Morris and others were right to criticize it. Not sure what all the fuss is about. As a well reasoned argument Gould missed the mark.
1,Unnecessary verbosity.,"At the risk of sounding very shallow, as I read this latest offering by Gould, all I could keep thinking was, ""Does this author have an editor""? And if so, why didn't she or he cut the extra verbage and some of the self-aggrandizement. I am well educated and keenly interested in the topic, but reading this tome was like slogging through molasses mixed with sand. I felt that the salient points could have been made in half of the words. In fact, after a while, I was reading only every other paragraph and not feeling like I was missing what Gould was attempting to convey. I wish that David Quammen or Carl Safina would publish a book on this subject. Their scientific writings are well researched, thorough and concise. I wouldn't spend the money on another of Gould's works, ever."
4,Gould's genius,"This is the first book that I read of Steven Jay Gould. I recieved it as a child and never did much more than skim over a few pages. However, I later read through the whole thing and found that Gould describes things in an amazing way. He explains how unpredictable circumstances have had a lot to do with evolution. It hasn't always been a survival of the fittest. It has sometimes been a survival of the most lucky. This book introduces a lot of the fauna of the Burgess Shale, which is pretty wild. A lot more has been learned about these creatures since this book was written, and many of them have been classified. This book allows us a glimpse of the ancient past of life on earth."
3,Factually incorrect?,"This was an enjoyable book to read, but (I am not an expert) I believe his main contentions in the book have since been proven wrong. Specifically, he claims the fossils are from several very odd creatures (one that walked on spikes, for example.) However, since the writing of the book, I believe additional, more complete, fossils have been discovered which show that the animals were actually not that odd. In other words, his philosophical conclusions about ""wonderful life"" were based on INCORRECTLY re-assembling bits of fossils into whole animals. Does anyone out there know if this is true??"
2,Science made politically correct.,"Gould, who's own actual research concerned snails, has found a more successful niche writing popular science. Some of his discussions, such as those involving the punctuated equalibrium nature of evolution or the explosion of the diversity of life during the cambrian period, are interesting. However, whenever he moves on to human populations, he always takes the ""politically correct"" tact, for example, denying a genetic basis of intellience. When he sticks to his own field, his books contain true pearls. Unfortunantely, one generally has to dig through a large pile of excrement to find them."
4,"Great, but not as good as Delphos St. John's production","My school put this play on (except it had the 1959 book) and I loved the way they acted. The songs, ""Way out West"" and ""The Lady is a Tramp"" are clever, witty, and truly define Lorenz Hart's style. I loved Kara Eickolt's version of ""My Funny Valentine"" (she sang it at my school) in which she sang a more demure, more ""feminine"" song. It was much more beautiful than the woman on the CD's tomboyish version. All in all, get this CD!"
2,Good only for Generalizations,"While this book is somewhat an ""all inclusive book"" on the Old Testament, the commentary lacks detail. This is not to say I regret having purchased this book, however, it is not so much a guide through the O.T. as one might be looking for. It is not an extensive viewing of the O.T. but rather a glimpse at each part of the O.T. Therefore, I suggest this for those that wish a light reading of what the O.T. comprises. Yet, for the reader that is looking for depth I would go elsewhere. Simply put, this book seems to have been written just to let you know the story lines within the O.T. and to give limited commentary as to what is conveyed. This would be a good book for young teens and those who are beginning to study God's word. The epilogue is a well written essay tying Christ to the Old Testament."
2,Academic professionalism,"At first sight the book seems so insightful - and it clearly stems from a sincere wish to understand other cultures and others holding different views than one's own within one's own culture. But then comes page 20. Gutmann writes that the task is to rescue us from a world of entrenched battlefields and point the way to ""mutually respectful communities of substantial, sometimes even fundamental, INTELLECTUAL disagreement"" (my emphasis). What such a viewpoint does is to limit the discussion to rational discourse. One can agree on a base-line of open discussion with those you may be in diasagreement with but only when the 'crazies' have been left outside, those who preach hatred, or even those who choose to opt out. This is all what Richard Rorty called 'wet liberalism'. Terribly disappointing. After Gutmann's intellectualist and ultimately elitist point of view dawns, the other essays fall within the same light."
5,outstanding,an informative and entertaining look at gay and lesbian images on radio and television through the decades. the author makes a number of interesting and relevant points in a non-judgmental yet authoritative style. should be on all public and university library shelves.
3,It's okay,There are 6 or more tracks that I skip and the remaining songs range from decent to good. Not bad for the price.
3,It's not what I expected,"As my special perfume I wear Cabotine (which I absolutely love love) so I thought I would give this one a go. I generally wear fruity or woody scents. So this was out of my comfort zone. It is a perfume that is not for me, once on my skin it was harsh to my nose. Although I had lots of comments about the smell. I was not comfotable wearing it...so being the wonderful friend I am I gave it to a good friend who absolutely loves it...and it smells great on her"
5,Beautifully written and illustrated,"I have always loved Alfie books and this one is, as always, just delightful. Children and adults alike can really enjoy this!"
3,Classic medieval tale,"I have the VHS of this movie. It's a classic , cliche medieval story. The good guys and bad guys are clearly defined, the princess has a crush on a commoner etc. Its ok."
1,Video Princess and the Goblin,"What a rip-off! The story The Princess and the Goblin, by George MacDonald, is so fun and so rich that this DVD has no right to even associate itself with the real thing. Why did the makers of this schlock not think the original details were worthy of duplicating?"
2,"Use Caution, Nightmares","I saw this movie as a child (5 - 7 years old) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards. So if you have a gentle-hearted child, please be careful about letting them see this movie."
1,Pass On This One,"As an animation major, I enjoy all sorts of bad foreign films, tasteless humor, and bad animated art. I thought I'd buy this...thing... on a whim and maybe discover some cult classic.Yeah. Couldn't even get through the first fifteen minutes, it was so awful.Tried to give it away for free on Craiglsist, but nobody wanted to waste the gas to come pick it up. One star is required to review, but given the option I'd give it a negative star.STAY AWAY!"
1,never got it,I ordered my product over a month ago and still haven't gotten it. I had to wait a month to see if it would be shipped and now that it hasn't and I've moved across the country I'm hoping I'll be able to get a refund.
5,For the love of childhood!,"If anyone remembered this from when they were kids and want a visual of their childhood once again? Then look no further than The Princess and The Goblin! I watched this after years of not, and I still remembered the words to the song!"
4,"classic, just classic",This is a great family film no dought about that.The kids will just eat this film up.Its about a princess that goes on a magicall quest to save her kingdom from the goblin empire.On her quest she is joined by her cat and a few other friends.I say it is classic because everything about it is hand drawn and marvelous.I think you shouldnt pass this classic up its a great family film and they don't make animated movies like this any more. the only reason i gave it 4 stars was because itjust a little bit out datedother than that its a sure winner. there you have it folks its sure to win you and your famlie's. peice out!!!.
5,Cute Movie,"I enjoy the plot and the characters are well done, the singing is silly but it's ok. Good movie for small children."
4,Good childhood memories,I bought this because I remembered watching it as a kid. It's creepier and weirder than I remember. But still good. We'll see if my future children like it.
2,Tiny book with big price,"I am teaching a course in store design and needed a reference book. I needed a text book with philosophy, more than a picture book. I was SHOCKED when this tiny 61 page book arrived, with 21 pictures. I expected more book for the buck. The book concentrates on planning philosophy for large stores. I was hoping to get more information regarding small, boutique stores. I am sure some of the principals for large store planning will apply, however was very disappointed in overall content and quality of the book. The previous review must have been written by a friend."
1,Dissapointment,"I received the cd just yesterday,after a month of waiting.It's a true dissapointment.The reason?The tracks of the cd are not interpreted by their own singers!!!!So,if you're looking for the original Mexican songs,this cd is definetely not the right one!!!"
5,Wonderful Book,"Robert Bly has done it again. He has written a book that is very infomative and makes you feel as if you can make $85,000 a year writing also. I am so happy that I bought his book."
5,"The Best Single-Source, How-To Book for Freelance Writing","While seriously considering taking up freelance writing, I happened across this book. The title itself was enough to cause me to buy it. After all, who wouldn't want to make $85,000 doing what they like to do? The book turned out to be a treasure chest of information for those who would desire to freelance. From the basics, to how to sell yourself, the book answers every question a beginning freelancer could ask. The book supplies so much more than the price attached to it. If you are thinking of writing freelance, then this book is a must-have for your reference shelf."
4,Great Bluesy Album,"I was extremely pleased when I received this album. Some people think it's a bit too bluesy but I enjoyed it. It sort of held back Ronnie's powerful vocals but if your a big fan of him you should buy it.My favorite song off the album was Gambler, Gambler. It is the closest to hard rock on this albuma and sounds FANTASTIC in my opinion. Ronnie lets loose with his vocals in this one and theres some pretty good guitar and piano parts. It's a really jumpy and energetic song."
5,Dio,"What can you say? First elf album for a dio fan is a must! On lp it sounds like it should, all the cd and mp3 versions aren't as good. song Never More is one of dio's finest."
3,blues meets rock for little fire,"i am a huge fan of ronnie james dio. i love dio's band (of the same name) as well as sabbath era dio. in fact sabbath era dio beats ozzy's era hands down for me so i was curious about the band dio started in. i was shocked. this IS NOT metal or anything close to rainbow or sabbath era dio or dio, the band itself. it is blues rock straight and simpel, in my opinion.gone is the range and brilliance that dio acheived in later bands. there is no guitar magic. there is little magic. what magic there is comes in the way of heart. this is a very emotional album but that is what good blues is all about. i was a little disappointed.there are a couple of songs that are good and a few moments that rock but all in all this album is a 3 star middle of the road venture, neither dropping to the bottom nor rising to the stars of greatness."
3,Elf - self-titled (Sony),"Originally released in 1972, this was Elf's first lp(produced by Roger Glover and Ian Paice). As most of you are aware of it, Elf was the band that Ronnie James Dio was in before joining up with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. This is more 'heavy blues rock' than any thing else. Somewhat inspiring tunes here are ""First Avenue"", ""Sit Down Honey""(maybe it's just me, but this reminds me of like a rough Rod Stewart song) and ""Love Me like A Woman"". Do keep in mind this is VERY different in style from Dio's solo work, or his music with Rainbow or Sabbath for that matter. Might appeal to fans of Cactus,Samson,Iron Butterfly and possibly April Wine."
4,mickey lee soule where are you,SOME OF THE BEST PIANO PLAYING YOU WILL EVER HEAR ON A ROCK ALBUM.DIO SINGING AND GREAT GUITAR FROM DAVID FEINSTEIN WHO WENT ON TO FORM FASTWAY AND THE RODS IN LATER YEARS.THIS CD IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES AND THE PIANO PLAYING BY MICKEY LEE SOULE IS FANTASTIC.
2,OneTimeCostumeUse,"Good as it is, but it's not a ""toy"" really. Used it for a prisoner outfit. The ""link"" part broke right away."
4,A great book to give to your new crew,An easy to read overview of all the basics. Perfect for someone getting started in club racing and a great book to bring new crew up to speed.
4,Becoming Proficient at Sailboat Racing,"This is a very well written book for the novice sailboat racer. It tells you everything you need to know to get started, however there is much more involved than just reading and understanding. There is much material to grasp and absorb, too much to take in during one reading. During my first series of races after I finished the book I still came in last place, not because the book was inadequate, but because the learning curve for racing requires much practice. Buying and reading this book is a worthwhile investment if you are serious about racing. Just be prepared to learn a little at a time and practice a lot. And better yet, take someone with you who is good at racing who can teach you as you sail. One of our sailing club's other members went from near last place to second place this past weekend after having a very experienced sailor as his crew. Sailboat racing is very challenging, but then how much fun would it be if it was easy?"
2,Dont bother with this Bi plane,Found this plane to be unsafe with the turning blade that you can stop but one little movement and that blade will start up again. My son broke the supports to the pontoons and also it supposed to move in water and doesnt.
1,Sea plane,"No remote control, this would be a great toy for small children to use in the bath tub, the propeller moves with the touch of your finger, you can touch it to shut it off and does not hurt the finger. My 10 year son was ok with it, now it just sits."
2,good in a pinch,"my 4 year old son recently became obsessed with ""banana planes"" (sea planes) and i wanted to get him one for his birthday. i couldnt find one anywhere, which i how i ended up ordering this one. it was not durable enough for him, which i predicted, but like i said, i was kinda desperate. the propellar really works and it does float and go across water. probably great for older kids."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I thought the world couldn't take another small town grieving brooding silent resentments I hate this place story. The 3 men in this film are so withdrawn it takes almost the whole movie for them to seem like real people. But Kristen Stewart as the young crippled girl eventually steals every scene. I expected her to overact just that fatal millimeter or have lines that manipulated or preached at the audience, but she never did. Well done."
4,This is why I love Indies,"I bought this movie because, I have always admired Mary Stuart Masterson as a actress. I wondered if she could do as well in the director chair. I personally, thought she did a excellent job. I don't know what her budget was, so my only reservation would of been a bit more in the begining, leading into the illness that plagued Kristen Stewarts character. Kristen Stewarts portrayal of a young girl who knows she is dying and wants to live a lifetime in the short time she has is heart wrenching.I was happy to see that Masterson went with a ""normal"" guy, to play opposite Stewart, instead of going for the ""pretty boy."" That would of been the norm for Hollywood, Masterson went for a ""real"" person. I have always admired Mastersons work as a actress, I hope she finds herself in the directors seat again...Buy or rent this movie, sit back and enjoy a slow, meaningful look intoa tender and romantic story of a girl trying to fill a lifetime into the few years she has been given."
2,Good potential ruined by bad writing,"This is the kind of movie I tend to like, in which not much happens but interesting characters interact with one another in quiet ways that draw me into their world. Unfortunately the formula does not work here. The problem is the screenplay.The basic story is fine; the characters are a decently varied assortment of potentially interesting folk; the actors are good enough (although Stewart is the only one who really shines, and even the two old pros, Dern and Ashley, are embarrassing only because of the awful screenplay); and the direction, photography, etc, are competent; but the dialog is awful. Really, really bad.I suppose it is trying to be deep and meaningful, but it is just painfully stilted and artificial: from beginning to end, not one word any character speaks sounds like a real human being talking. The extremely awkward title is a good example of what the dialog is like. The Cake Eaters had good potential but was torpedoed by very bad writing."
2,"Horrible Claptrap? Close but not quite...,","The Cake Eaters is another Lifetime movie of the week in a genre I like to call ""I Cry and Cry and then I Die"".I don't think this film was deliberately trying to be this trite and maudlin, its just the nature of the beast. The film has the requisite whining, moaning and crying to satisfy lovers of this type of film. And it was directed by the star of many of said Lifetime movies. Plus you have ""The Illness"" - I call it ""Movie-itis""; usually one character in this type of movie has it. It generates more whining and moaning.Watching this movie is like being stuck in a room with a bunch of unhappy housecats, and one of them is sick. You feel bad for wanting to leave the room, but you HAVE to get the HeXX out of there and quick.Want something less hokey, less of a joke? Watch the film ""Passengers"" - its more honest than this tripe."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!,"I thought that this movie was going to be good based on the review everybody had left here, but holy crap! I was seriously mistaken! Im not sure if it was awful due to the poor filming, Kristen Stuart, or just the movie as a whole. I hated it. I regret buying it. It had SOOOO much potential to be a great movie, but it failed miserably.So, do unlike I did. If you think you want to buy it... Watch the freakin trailer on youtube first! I accidentally forgot to. And now Im going to have to either through this movie away or sell it for 1/8th the price I paid for it at a garage sell.Thanks for reading my review and I hope it was more helpful than all the other ones that were clearly written by people that had never seen the movie.Ps: I bought it ""new"" and there wasnt even any shrink wrap on it and there was a yard sale sticker on it. So to top it off I payed for a new movie (at the time costing $8) and it was used...Badly!"
5,Nightmare Everafter,I purchased this item for a freind who is obsessed with the NMBC franchise. I was told this was a great gift that will be used for many years to come. It was larger and fluffier than expected with a nick overall look too!!
3,Not that great and not for the beginner,"This book disappointed me. I have used Sybex books in the past to study for my Windows NT exams with pretty good results. This book seems to gloss over some very important concepts, at the same time telling you that you need to understand them for the test. If you know your stuff, it is not all that bad, but this is definitely not for a beginner. The questions at the end of the chapters sometimes don't refer to anything you would have learned from reading the chapter."
2,"Incomplete, disorganized and full of errors","I'm extremely disappointed to have to give this rating. All of the Sybex MCSE book that I have read have been great. This book is missing a LOT of information. For example, there are several questions in the back of each chapter that ask questions that were not discussed, or have answers with data that is nowhere to be found.The content is terribly disorganized with two sections on DHCP, for example, repeating themselves. Just about every topic provides incomplete information. Errors, typographical and question answers, are everywhere! Two words in a row, misspellings, mislabeled end of chapter answers. ACK!This really is an awful book; HUGE disappointment. Stay away from this brick."
2,Quite disappointed.,"Very limited informatons, just finished pg.117 out of 949 pages. The price is good but is that all I want, might not continue my reading."
3,"Great Tool, Bad Description","The tool is amazing. I own the 12"" version and love its strength and versatility. The bad review here is to let you know there is an error in the product description; the 10"" plier wrench has a maximum 1-3/4"" capacity, not 2-3/8"" as stated in the product description. (refer to Knipex.com)"
1,author is not sincere!,"Sarah Palin's speechwriter, Matthew Scully, is a perfect example of a lying, conscienceless writer who will do anything for money. Besides being a speechwriter for Bush and Palin, he is ALSO the author of THIS book, described by The New York Times as a ""horrible, wonderful, important book,"" in large measure ""because the author, an avowed conservative Republican and former speechwriter for George W. Bush, is an unexpected defender of the animals against the depredations of profit driven corporations, swaggering, gun-loving hunters, proponents of renewed 'harvesting' of whales and elephants and others who insist that all of nature is humanity's romper room, to play with, rearrange, and plunder at will."" ..... So here is Scully putting his words in the mouth of a lying, merciless enemy of all animals and environmental causes. Too sickening for words."
2,What??,"The contents of this book was disappointing. Instead of holding my attention with new ideas and helpful methods, it instead attacked various entities for their animal abuse measures. It was very rambling, wordy, and did not keep me focused. I do not recommend you buy this product, however, I will sell you mine at a good price if you want it."
1,Not helpful to the animals and written by a perpetuator of war,"This book does nothing but make excuses for treating animals as slaves and putting forth the Christian perspective. When the book came out, I was invited to a private party to meet the author whom I immediately thought was not at all an animal supporter and not at all someone whom I could ever respect. Over the years, he has gone on to prove this as a Bush/Cheney lackey, who has pushed the phoney war agenda, makes excuses for treating animals kindly, and who has now crafted the speech of Sarah Palin, the most anti-animal candidate ever running for office in my opinion. It is really a shame that Gene Baur, Wayne Pacelle, and Karen Dawn have been supporters of this man."
1,Scully Hypocrite,"I find Scully to be a hypocrite, liar and greed monger. He wrote Sarah Palin's sneering, nasty speech, stretching truths about who she is and outrighting lying and chiding our presidential nominees. His hate speech full of divisive and attack lines will be remembered and talked about in the short term, but in the long term, the results of his manipulated words and outcome on society will be on his conscience alone. How could he write such a negative hate speech for a women who shoots animals from a helicopter and can ""field-dress"" a moose. As if that is such an accomplishment. ""Dominion"" and all it's crediblility is lost and wasted on a moment that may forever change the political landscape and not for the better. Just as Americans were turning the tide and engaging in politics and discussing issues and paying attention, Single minded Scully wrote those devisive words of hate, recoiling all the gains of a nation. I don't know how he will sleep at night."
4,Infuriating,"In more ways than one this book makes me mad. Certainly, what Scully is saying should drive any sane, compassionate person wild with anger at the way these people, and countries, are acting.I highly recommend this book for it's indepth chapters, especially on Safari Club and whaling.What I don't like is Scully's repetitive nature, and his flowery speech. There were times I found the book difficult reading, and certainly this is a shame as it will limit the audience. If this book had been edited by Eric Schlosser then it would have been perfect!"
5,Fantastic,"Order it now! This is a great book, not just because of the light it sheds on the treatment of animals, but because of its depiction of the weirdness of human beings. The chapter on safari hunters is an unbelievable dark comedy. So is the chapter on hog farmers. The fact that Scully is a former speech writer for George Bush adds a lot to his credibility. He had not much to gain, and a lot to lose, by writing the book."
5,"Heartbreaking, yet makes a great gift!","As a vegetarian and animal protectionist my knowledge of the way we treat animals in America is what I would call ""hard core"". Reading this book, however, opened my eyes to additional aspects of animal profiteering that were heartbreaking. The first two chapters of the book had the greatest affect on me, and I'm not embarassed to admit that they made me cry. The best part about this book is that it isn't directed toward people like me who are already informed about a lot of the issues, but more towards the ""common American"" who uses animal products out of habit and doesn't really even think twice about it. After reading Dominion, I bought ten copies of this book, and used them as Christmas presents for my parents, aunts, and cousins. This is a great way to introduce yourself or someone you care about to the deplorable way that corporate America and the political elite treat animals in this country. I HIGHLY recommend it."
5,Phenomenal,The best book I've ever read - heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A MUST read for any animal lover or anyone who considers themselves a compassionate person. An even better read for anyone who isn't/doesn't.
1,Dominion is Full of Contradictions,"Scully makes two strong, yet completely contraditory arguments:1. Modern industrial animal farming is immoral. Regulations should be enacted/enforced to allow animals more free-range and natural lives. The detached consumer enables this awful practice to continue.2. Hunting - especially ranch-style hunting -is immoral and should be outlawed. This has been done already in some states.In the first case Scully says free-range animals are the solution. In the second case -where he gets precisely what he wants- an involved consumer of an animal in a relatively naturaly environment...he thinks should be outlawed.That Mr. Scully writes for Bush2 is no surprise. No stronger argument against animal rights has ever been written.Todd"
5,"Powerful, Logical and Persuasive","Mr. Scully's ""DOMINION"" was recommended to me by a vegetarian acquaintance. It was with some hesitation I purchased the book, but I was quickly impressed by Mr. Scully's down-to-earth logic, his factual arguments, and the non-emotional perspective upon which his positions are based.By the end of chapter 1, I'd been moved to a place of 'moral discomfort' by Mr. Scully's clear and cogent logic. He does not write from a traditional ""Animal Rights"" perspective, but takes the position that humans have (by whatever cause) been placed in a position of power in this world. As the ""apex creature"", we have a moral responsibility to make decisions based on more than simple expediancy. He stresses the responsibility of humankind, not the 'rights' of the animals.I found his position and his arguments compelling, a reaction I suspect most open minded readers will share."
5,Scully is the Shakespeare of the Animal Rights Debate,"Matthew Scully's captivating and eloquent _Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy_ accomplishes the seemingly impossible. With dazzlingly beautiful prose, Scully exposes the hideous cruelty and greed behind animal exploitation. Scully is the Shakespeare of the animal rights debate."
4,Great Game,"I loved this game as a kid and bought this to play with my kids. It is still a fun game but the pieces seem a lot smaller than what they used to be. I like the wooden box to store the game in, hopefully we will be able to keep it for a long time. An enjoyable game that can be played with anyone over the age of 5."
4,"Fun game, box is not great","Stratego is a pretty classic game, and this edition brings a more elaborate package than a typical cardboard Hasbro game box. The sliding lid of the wooden box only goes on one way and does not consistently slide all the way unless everything inside is very tightly packed in.Gameplay is simple enough and boils down to hiding your flag and comparing numbers as you encounter enemy pieces. Remembering revealed values can give a great advantage in the game, so adults may have an unfair advantage over younger kids."
5,Excellent game for 2 people - It teaches strategy,I have played this game with my son several times. what I like about this game is that it requires a thought and strategy. This has to go into the top list of games. It is a classic.
4,Good. But somewhat needless.,"The signs are good, but some of them are impractical for use with my 1yr old. The songs are a little more upbeat than other versions."
2,not my favorite of the series,Vol 1 and 2 are by far OUR FAVORITES! vol 4 just seems that the lady is so fake. Her facial expressions in this one is awful. I bought it b.c the reviews seemed to really like it. I do recommend 1 and 2!
5,Excellent in every way,"My baby has been brought up on this WHOLE Baby Signing Time set.(I bought the whole Signing Time series in a box) There is not enough time or space to express how much I love this series. I love it so much I am taking the time to slowly type this review, left handed, with a broken arm that is in a full cast...... so you KNOW totally recommend every parent to get this. You will be amazed at how advanced, in language and communication, your child can become. A++++"
3,good but the music wasn't as catchy as Volume 1,my daughter LOVES Volume I of this series but was slightly dissapointed with the music in this volume.
3,Only for die hard Boz Fans,"Sound quality not the greatest, but if you are a Boz lover, it's enjoyable with some classic songs, but the 2005 Greatest Hits Live is better quality"
2,BRUCE DUMBED DOWN,"This review focused on the mundane aspects of Bruce's life and adds nothing new to the literature on The Boss. Nevertheless, its a fun easy read, with decent photos, as long as someone is not too knowledgeable or interested in Springsteen."
2,"Not bad, nothing new","The book is fine for those that have not followed Bruce throughout his career. It hits the highlights with some good photos, but doesn't get to the art of the man. Recommended for those who like ""Born In the USA,"" but are uninitiated with the stronger works like ""Tunnel Of Love,"" ""Darkness On The Edge Of Town"" or ""The River.""Dan"
5,Oceania,"Having lived in New Zealand, I was ecstatic to find there was a Maori CD. This is a real musical sample of the beauty of the country and the spirit of the wonderful Maori people. The music alone makes this a five star selection...and the wonderful voice of Hine makes it merit ten!"
5,I love this CD!,"I have owned this CD for several years and never tire of listening to it. It is so beautiful and powerful. I keep hoping for another release. If you enjoy world music, please try this one!"
1,You call this music?,"If you grew up on american culture, you probably will not like this cd. Just listening to the samples made my shutter. If you only know English, don't bother!"
5,Great Amazon Pick,This was the best find. It came as a recommendation from amazon based on my prefrences. This is perhaps the most beautiful music I've ever heard. It's extremely expressive. I wish I could master the language so I could sing along in my car.I highly recommend it.
5,Stays in your head...,"I bought this cd on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. If you are tired of the everyday ""music"" being played on the radio, try this! Keep an open mind and listen more than once. You just might find a new treasure and a whole new form of music to envelope your soul."
5,Oceania,"INCREDIBLE ! A MOVING AND INSPIRING WORK. TRACKS 1,4,6,7,9 ARE PURE ART FORMS ! THE SUBTLE RHYTHMS AND SOUNDS BUILD INTO MAGNIFICENT AND POWERFULLY SEDUCTIVE MELODIES, WHICH WILL LEAVE ONE EXHAUSTED FOR MORE! YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS! RS"
5,Great Early Album,Few people recall counting flowers on the wall as the song that set the Satlers on there way to stardom long ago.But it did and it is on the Album along with a mix of old golden standards
5,1 Picture = 1000 Words,"The best way to make a point about how something looks is to simply show it to us, and that's exactly what this book does best. I did percieve a slight European bent in some sections, but that may just be my own pesky American prejudices, and it did nothing to interfere with my reading enjoyment. Fascinating reading or browsing (this book would make a great CD-ROM) for anyone interested in the evolution of so many things we may take for granted"
5,Masters and the Path,"To Whom This May Concern,An open mind and heart, plus the desire to greatly enrich one's life, are all you need to bring to this book - then prepare yourself for some rather startling truly marvelous results. Masters and the Path provides the means to be our own instruments in dramatically and positively changing our lives. I read this book many years ago (borrowed), and have always kept an eye open looking for an original hardcover copy for myself. I was very excited to find a source, Kessinger Publishing's Rare Prints, to order through Amazon (albeit a reprint). Overall, the book is a clear and practical guide while simultaneously being inspiring and uplifting.Sincerely,Elaine McCulloh Kessingere.kessinger@att.net"
5,Very good book,Suggested to any person looking to develop on a spiritual path. It is a deep and concise reading about the spirituality.
3,"Not a bad book, but there are better","The 1986 playoffs were some of the best games that baseball has seen. Authour Mike Sowell has tried to capture the excitement and suspense of those playoffs in ""One Pitch Away""While not a bad book, one can't help leaving this book feeling that much more could have been done with it. The problem I have with the book is that 2/3 of it is spent interviewing the players of those playoffs. I didn't really care about hearing about Doug DeCinces and his investment company. Sowell probably could have gone into greater detail about the whole season and the effect the 86 playoffs had on baseball.Not a bad book, but there are better."
4,WONDERFUL,"Granted, I've only used the very basic women's razors before, but I LOVE this one. I've always been prone to knicks and razorburn, and this stops all of that.I also have coarse, thick, dark hair, and have ZERO problem on my legs - very close shave. On my underarms, I occasionally have to go back over twice, but that's all."
4,For Vanilla lovers,"My husband actually did not like this flavor, but he isn't that big into Vanilla. However, my in-laws raved! They may actually buy a Senseo based on trying ours. They didn't want to drink all of our coffee, but we said go ahead since my husband didn't like it. They must have had 3 cups each of this coffee, it was like they couldn't get enough. I suggest that you actually try any Senseo flavor by buying one pack at the store first to see if you like the flavor. If you do, come back to Amazon and order in bulk to save you money. $3.84 at Walmart for a package of 10 pods = .38 each. Here it is only .25 a cup of coffee at the current price."
4,If you own a senseo machine you HAVE TO USE THESE PODS!,"I have owned and used a Senseo home brew machine now for over 6 months. By far this system witht the senseo pods, makes the best cup of coffee that I have ever had at home. I find myself hording the genuine pods for myself and special guests. My Other guests are served turkish ground Starbucks coffee in an adaptor.The difference between the genuine pods and the others is the amount of froth that is generateed and the smoothness of the coffee. to date, all of the other brands that I have tried (Java pods and Maxwell house) leave less than a 1/2"" of froth and an after taste/sour note.I like these pods as they impart a lovely vanilla note that is slightly nutty. The froth is about 3/4"" thick. Typically I use 2 pods and create the large amount of coffee. 2 vanilla bistro pods have the stregth of 2 mild regular pods. This makes for a lovely middle of the day coffee but does not have the needed early morning kick/strength."
4,More options for my Senseo,"I love my Senseo, and I am thrilled to have flavor options for it. Personally I am not much for flavored coffee, and I prefer the dark roast, and that is what I drink myself most of the time. One of my favorite things about the Senseo is how easy it is to make everyone a different cup of coffee. The decaf folks can have decaf, the regular can have regular. Now the ones who like flavor can have flavor. I will definitely always have the flavored Senseo Pods in stock in our home so that we have them to offer guests. They love it.I like this vanilla over others I have tasted because the vanilla flavor is not overwhelming and it doesn't make the coffee seem too sweet. Overall I am pleased."
5,Paris Vanilla Bistro is Perfect,This new flavor is excellent! The hint of vanilla adds a wonderful flavor and aroma to the coffee. It is a great addition to the Senseo pod family.
3,Senseo French Vanilla,"The French Vanilla flavor and aroma is too pungent when used alone. In order to reduce the intense flavor, I recommend using only one French Vanilla pod and one pod of an unflavored coffee, either decaf or otherwise."
4,"Nice ""hint of Vanilla"" coffee","This coffee is pretty tasty. Not too strong of a vanilla flavor, more of a ""hint"" of vanilla. Better with a bit of milk and sugar. A nice occasional change from the Sumarta (now that's a good cup of senseo joe!)"
5,AMAZING COFFE AND SMELLS TO WAKE U UP,LOVE THIS COFFEE AND RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE. JUST DELICIOUS AND WAKES ME UP TO GIVE ENOUGH ENERGY FOR THE DAY. THANK YOU
4,Senseo Paris French Vanilla,"I order this flavor regularly. It is one of my favorites. If you like the other Senseo pods and flavored coffee, then you will like this one too. It is smooth, not a strong flavor."
1,Save your taste buds a traumatic experience,I just received these today for my wife. They were the most horrible tasting coffee ever. This wasn't just a case of not caring for this -- the coffee was down right nasty. Both my wife and I thought so. I don't know if we just got a bad batch or what -- but we wont be ordering this again.
3,"Great aroma, needs stronger coffee flavor","I have shared all three Senseo flavored coffees with several people at work. Everyone loves the smell of the coffees but many of us would prefer a stronger coffee flavor.Overall, it is nice to be able to offer a choice of flavors to people visiting my office and the convenience can't be beat. My personal favorite is still the dark roast."
1,HORRIBLE I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"I purchased these pods on Amazon because they were a good deal and a dollar cheaper than in my grocwery store and now I know why. When I open the package I noticed that the Senseo watermark was very faint and hardly visable. When I made the coffee, it took me 3X the pods to make a decent cup of coffee. What's the point of making pod coffee if you have to stand there all day to make a good cup. I am back to buying pods at the local store now."
3,Not very special,"I love French Vanilla creamer in my coffee, but if you are expecting the same taste with this coffee, like I was, you will be disappointed. It tastes like weak regular coffee with only a faint hint of vanilla flavoring. I still had to add my creamer. I really like the Senseo coffee (I use it with my Hamilton Beach single cup maker) but I don't think I will buy the flavored anymore. I will stick with the regular and add my creamer."
2,French Vanilla isn't good,"I really enjoy Senseo's Dark Roast, but the French Vanilla is terrible. May be a matter of taste, but that's what my taste buds say."
3,Not the best pod!,"I was disappointed by this pod. The coffee is weak. No real zing to it. If you like rich, full bodied coffee flavour in your coffee this is not for you. The vanilla flavour in it is okay but just not enough coffee for me. I'm sticking to my dark roast pods."
5,YUM!,I used my Senseo for the very first time yesterday and this flavor was the first pod I put into the machine. WOW! It's so good! I used to drink one-two cups of instant coffee a day and after trying this coffee in my Senseo I think I'm going to have to say BYE-BYE to my instant coffee... this stuff is delicious!
5,Senseo Paris French Vanilla Bistro Coffee Pods,Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee pods are easy to use and easy to clean up. The pods brew a very flavorful cup of coffee. French Vanilla is one of my favorites.
2,artificial candy like vanilla flavor,"These are okay, but I prefer Target's Archer Farms brand coffee pods much more. They cost less, are bigger, individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee with real vanilla flavor."
2,Misleading,"On the package, it clearly states that these are for use in all pod brewers. So, naturally, I thought I'd be able to use them in my Keurig single cup brewer. I guess if I get a My K-cup I might be able to use these, but otherwise, I wasted my money. I'm very disappointed. Live and learn, I suppose."
4,Great Coffee,"This is a great coffee. Full bodied, with touch of vanilla flavor. It's nice and frothy, unlike some of the other brands, and the froth lasts longer."
5,Really Good Coffee,I really enjoyed this coffee. My husband also liked it very much. I would recommend this as a good buy.
4,Delicious,"The is very good coffee. It is a bit sweet, and a very nice taste to it. It would be nice if one pod made a bigger cup of coffee, but I can get a very good 6-7 oz cup from one pod. I do like my coffee a little strong though, so maybe others will be able to get a bigger cup if its not as strong. I have taken to making a cup in the afternoon, something I've never done before. IT is so easy to have in my office at work. No coffee grounds to mess with, just pop in the pod, water and your done!"
2,Flavorless French Vanilla,The only taste you will get from these pods are faint vanilla. You need two pods to make a cup of coffee and even with the two pods it does not taste like coffee. It tastes like watered down coffee with a fake vanilla flavoring.
5,Senseo Coffe Rocks,"I love Senseo Coffee, it's convenient, reasonably priced, and it tastes fantastic. The Paris French Vanilla is quite lovely."
3,Senseo pod review,"I bought a 4 pack of the Senseo Paris French Vanilla Caramel Bistro pods. They were pretty weak, and so could not make more than a 4 oz cup of coffee, which I actually stopped filling after 3 oz or so. It was ok, just very weak. Probably will not buy again."
3,Bought as Gift,Son in Law's favorite flavor of Coffee was hard to find locally and was a surprise that was well received.
5,Best flavor,Perfect hint of flavor with a touch of sweetness. The straight coffee varieties of this brand tends to be bitter so I really like this one the best.
3,It took some time....,We were looking for our Senseo Rio coffee pads when we came across the senseo Paris. At first we didnt like the taste too much but after a little while we got used to it. Now we order the coffee on a regular bases and like it very much. But if I ever find my german Rio again - I switch back..... For now were happy!
2,Not a fan.,Usually I love the taste of french vanilla coffee. For some reason I'm not crazy about this one. I found it leaves a funny aftertaste.
4,Decent cup of joe,"This produces a decent cup of java. Nothing spectacular, but worth drinking. It's a mild flavor but the vanilla is most prominent in the scent, not the taste."
5,Senseo Review,I have found that Senseo is the right coffee for me. I live by myself so usually only need one cup of coffee at a time. It is so easy with Senseo!
4,Senseo Pods,The French Vanilla Senseo Pods are convenient and tasty. With Amazons subscription they show up to my door every month cheaper than getting them locally.
3,Pleasant discussion,"No new information here, but a pleasant discussion about unexamined ways of acquiring information."
4,I knew you would read this book ; ),"Mayer takes on a taboo subject - often ridiculed by the religious AND the scientific communities but for different reasons. The scientists -because it is difficult to explain how esp works. The religious -because if humans were to develop their esp abilities -then we would all be prophets.This book is filled with interesting anecdotes, experiments, ideas, and people who figure prominently in the field of esp practice and esp research. If you are interested in the topics of psychic healing, subliminal messages, meditation, premonition, intuition, dreams, remote viewing, dowsing, and why Sigmund Freud was not fond of music (and more!)- this is the book for you. Read with an open mind. There is a notes section and an index."
5,"How do you ""know?""","Elizabeth Lloyd Mayer gives insight into understanding the world, the mind, and the unknown. Extraordinary Knowing is an in depth study into ESP and the rational mind. What Mayer uncovered in her research as she probed the minds of those in the fields of psychology and even a neurosurgeon, she found they too, inexplicably, just ""know"" things without rational explanation. Mayer found there was often shame associated with these admissions as society may not be quite ready to admit ESP or ""knowing"" as a viable alternative to rational thinking. What we do know is many have experienced this and Extraordinary Knowing asks if we could train our minds to use this perception all the time as a way of making deeper connections with each other. It's worth asking and well worth exploring. I thoroughly enjoyed Mayer's book and the questions it left for me to ponder on my own."
4,A real mystery,"I'm a mystery fan, and this book was a true mystery. I changed my mind several times about the identity of the bad guy (girl), but at the end of the book, everything made sense. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough! Yet I didn't want it to be over!"
4,suspense and mystery,"This book may not be a great work of literature, but it has a lot of suspense and will keep the reader guessing until the last page. It is the book equivalent of a scary movie- the kind where you keep telling the heroine ""don't go down in that basement"", ""don't go up in that attic"", ""don't walk down that alley"", but of course she always does. I really like a scary story, but it seems like most are either romance novels in disguise or so shallow I lose track of which character is which and I am not quite sure what state the events are taking place in. Anders supplies plenty of detail and just enough character development. I like something thrilliing, scary, and not too demanding to read on a cold, rainy evening curled up on the couch, and ""Dead Silence"", while not perfect, is just about right."
2,Too wordy and not enough action,"Liza is a counselor for a aerospace company. Due to the large layoffs, she is helping displaced employees. There's a conspircy in her company. Too many layoffs and too much work. As she's trying to figure out what's going on. Her house is broken into. She is being followed and she can't trust anyone. Ok, sounds like a good enough story. But, Liza takes everything too lightly. Her reactions are true to human nature. The people she confides in are wearing blinders. I found myself getting really angry with the stupidity of the characters that I kept putting this book down. The story had a good storyline. Just weak everywhere else."
2,Don't expect Crichton-like,"Though the cover artwork may be appealing, don't expect a sharply researched Crichton-like tale of intrigue here (ala 'Aiframe'). Though Anders does a fair job generating suspense and developing her characters, the reader is only superficially exposed to the high tech world of computers and aerospace technology that are signicant components of the story. Technical detail is avoided as Anders prefers to leverage her familiarity with the Seattle venue through various detailed and sometimes romantic descriptions of the Emerald City setting."
1,Not a useful reference for the birds of Egypt,"While a convenient size for the tourist, this guide just presented too little information for the serious birder. The photographs were uneven in quality and no range maps were included, although there was some written range information. In Egypt we used the Princeton field guide ""Birds of Europe"" almost exclusively, with excellent results; I would recommend it instead."
1,WALMART IS CHEAPER,You can get this product from walmart's website for 49.88 and that includes the cost to have it shipped to your house. Get it there not on amazon!!!!!
4,Hairy,"Larry and his friends find and try a bottle of something called Insta-Tan. Soon after course dark hair starts growing on his hands. What was in that bottle?One day his friend Manny doesn't show up for school nor band practice, and his house is empty. Has he moved? Why didn't he tell them?This is a good story, with two mysteries going on."
3,This book was sort of wierd,"Although I'm young, I'm a long-time Goosebumps fan. I didn't like this one as much as the other Goosebumps TV books because the ending disappointed me. It also wasn't quite as scary as the other books. Overall it was OK but not the best of the TV Goosebump books."
4,Cool!,"Larry is a kid who has a band, and his friends call him ""Hairy Larry"". One day he finds a bottle of tanning lotion that is supposed to give the person who weres it a tan. The next day that not only does the lotion not work, but he also finds out that he is growing gross black hair! If you want to find out the rest, read it yourself."
3,Not Knowing.,"This book really kept me interested. However, it wasn't as scary as many of the other Goosebumps books. The ending is a real kicker and though seems kind of a cop out, it does tie things together nicely. Overall, just an average book that nonetheless is fun to read."
2,A failure,The book was terrible. I did not like the way that it finished. I did not like all of it at all.
4,"I put this item on my wish list because of the May 15, 2005 review","in the NY Times by MARY JO SALTER titled ""Louisa May Alcott's American Girls"". I've read a ""girls"" version a million years ago and have one or more leather bound gifty editions which I haven't read. The Showalter-edited version should be close to the original so I will buy it next month. Please note I have not yet read this version despite my rating and I really wrote here to recommend the review."
1,This is NOT a book: it is an EXHIBITION CATALOGUE!,"I was disappointed and frustrated at getting this. I looked in America for a book on Dickinson because he is almost unheard of in England, and I was excited to find a title that sounded very promising. When the ""book"" came through the mail, however, it was such a disappointment as the intro explained that this was a publication to go with a series of exhibitions of Dickinson's work in America some time ago. As a result the little commentary there was too specific to be interesting to anyone who had not seen the exhibition, and was essentially was un-illuminating. The most important part of the book, ie. the images, were poorly reproduced in black and white, with the exception of a couple. Anyone who knows Dickinson will know that his work is painted in muted colours, rendering a black and white repro almost unreadable. Go elsewhere to find stuff about Dickinson; this does not do him - or your wallet - justice at all."
5,Sweet Product,Installed in a '04 2500HD silverado 6.0l gas. Have noticed an increase in fuel effiency. no knocks or pings. i did also change out my wires at the same time.
2,BOSCH PLATINUM,"As always Bosch products are great. BUT the shipping from this store leaves a lot to be desired!!! We ordered a set of 8. It took 4 shipments to receive all 8 Some were out of the boxes, some were packed in envelopes, some did not have any protective material around the electrodes. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
1,Rebate Offer,"I purchased 8 each, of this item, Bosch (4509) HGR9LQI0 9 Platinum IR Fusion Spark Plug, Pack of 1. A rebate was offered at the time of purchase that amounted to about $30.00. I applied for the rebate by completing the rebate form, and sending in everything the offer required. Eight weeks later I was informed that my request for the rebate was denied - the old UPC code was not sent in as required, was stated as the reason for denial. I had sent in everything, but the spark plugs, yet my rebate claim was still denied. I never expected this company to use this old ""bait and Switch"" policy. Needless to say, I'll never purchase another product from this company again. I'm also telling all of my 'facebook & email friends' about what this company is doing."
5,"Nice rebate, great power","As I age, less is more. The plugs do not requre gapping! My son installed these and the volant air system, what a difference. Power, idling, and launching my 5800 pound truck. Altough the truck is not a green truck, installing the plugs and air system increased in town from 11.4 to 13.1 or so. Set and forget!"
1,Could it Be Any Louder???,"This toy arrived without any instructions, so I called the company that we purchased it from (Back to Basics Toys) and they said they would get us the instructions before Christmas. They never did and never have since. We put batteries in and the thing basically SCREAMED at us so I called Back to Basics Toys again to ask how to contol the volume since we didn't have any instructions. Guess what? You can't control the volume. IT JUST YELLS ALL THE TIME. We sent it back, with any luck they will credit us back our money."
3,"Good facts, old technology","This was a X-mas gift for a 4 year old. Not much to hold his attention. No lights or interaction besides pressing the buttons. He enjoys pressing the buttons, but you get the same info everytime. No variation in information presented. Each country is delivered in the same voice, in the same rythem, the same intonation. Only thing that changes is the numbers and names. Sounds like listening to the automated customer help voice.He has picked up some of the information about various countries, but it just doesn't hold his attention.Probably better suited for someone who has the patience to sit and listen."
2,not very happy,"did not bring and instruction book and it does not look like its worth the price. now i have to go and buy something else for my grandson. I have to rethink future purchases, very very disappointed."
5,my 9 yr old loves this,"I bought this for my son for his 9th birthday, he loves this map he can't put it down it is fun, and he learns too"
3,Nice selections but pitched too high,"Impressive selection - in fact, probably half were ones I don't know, which either means they're obscure or I'm not as knowledgeable as I thought.Nice clear typography, and comb binding is a must for anything you want to stick on the piano.One complaint: Most of the songs were in keys that were too high for women. When we had a singalong night I and my band had to transpose on the fly so the women wouldn't be screeching."
5,Great for Rhythm Section combos and Instrumental Soloists,"As you can see from a few of the above reviews, that well-known eternal hot spot will freeze over before singers would ever quit whining about keys. Instrumentalists use these fake books too. The keys are fine. Buy the book."
4,The Ultimate Christmas Fake Book,"This book has 275 Christmas Songs, pretty much all in singable keys. There are lots of old time traditional favorites, along with newer contemporary selections. Good book."
5,Excellent Fake Book,"What a wonderful book. I record an annual holiday album for friends and family and I will be able to get years out of this book. Endless variety of music to choose from. Several oddities. Only complaint is the song Sleighbells is included, however, there is the one and only Christmas Shoes. Spiral binding for easy flip through. Also sits nicely on piano stand. Highly recommend it for lazy musicians who don't feel like using their ears to figure out these Christmas classics!"
5,Easy playing,You need to know the chords to play the songs with both hands but I purchased this for my pre-schooler and one-handed playing is fine. Great songbook for simple playing.
3,Ultimate Christmas ake Book,"It is not what I expected or really wanted ,yet it is a good collection of Christmas Songs. I was looking more for Church type Christmas Carols than general Christmas songs.I still want to keep the book it is worth what I paid."
4,great resource for working musicians and hobbyists,"It doesn't have everything and there are some odd omissions here and there (but I guess it says ""ultimate,"" not ""complete""), but it is a great resource for working musicians and hobbyists."
3,Got Most of the Standards...,"...and a whole lot (I mean a WHOLE LOT) of holiday tunes no one has ever heard of. This book could be half it's current size and it wouldn't suffer any. However, the standards are all in there (though ""Blue Christmas"" is mysteriously missing from this edition) and it's great for hammering out some Christmas cheer when friends and family are over."
1,ARE THEY KIDDING....,The print was soooooo small you could hardly see it and they thereby could cram many songs on one page but that was ridiculous......
5,MUST HAVE in ANY Musician's library,"I am a profressional pianist and this Christmas fake book is a MUST HAVE for any musician, especially gigging musicians. Almost any christmas song you might get a request for is in it. I have bought many, many christmas songbooks and this is the one I keep by my side throughout the holidays."
5,very nice!,I wanted to improve of chords on the piano and it has helped me greatly to improve on my Holiday music offered.
3,"Kindle Fake Books advertised, but not available","I enjoy my kindle-touch, reading two or three kindle books each month, and very much appreciate their availability. Now, I would like to order a couple of Fake (music)Books (lyrics, melody, chords) in electronic form, mostly to view on my desktop and laptop using the downloaded kindle app. I am disappointed that these books, while advertised, are not available in kindle format. I'm not sure why this is so, unless it is because each Fake Book page may contain too much information for the 7-inch kindle display. However, they should display clearly on my larger laptop and desktop monitors. The average rating I've given the book is because of its unavailability. I'm sure I would give it a higher rating if I could actually view it."
2,It's not all that..,"For a Fake Book that's copying most of the Christmas music, I was disappointed to find that out of the 276 songs presented, it's like every 9 or 10th song listed is popular tune that you hear during the Christmas holiday season. Call me old fashion but when I thumb through and not find ""White Christmas"" common, that's an all time classic. IF you're in the market of just adding just one more book to your Christmas collection then by all means this may be good for you. However, with an heading of saying 276 Christmas songs, I was sure that this would be then ultimate book that I'd wouldn't have to go and buy and other book.It is well made, Chords clearly written/photo copied, but just not my kind of music I was expecting.And last but not least, ""read the fine prints on restocking fees"" of a returned book. I got back less than 1/2 of what I paid for the book after all the add on fees were tagged."
4,Useful addition....,This extensive book of seasonal songs is a useful addition to Any Christmas music library. In the fake book format it has the melody line plus chords for many usual and unusual Yuletide songs.
5,Inspecting Surgical Instruments,"Great reference, easy to read, textbook for all clinical areas of healthcare. Easy to understand. Magnificent, up-close photography. Simple to read. Thorough inspection processes. There are published sharpness test standards that finally establish a criteria for determining when an instrument is dull. The best published reference for determining quality of surgical instruments. Best textbook out there!"
5,Great for detoxifying - really works!,"Liver Rescue III + with Milk ThistleLiver Rescue III is amazing for helping the body detoxify. It helps process environmental as well as food toxins, and when you are doing a cleanse assists the body by reducing the effects of a ""Healing Crisis"". It is a wonderful product which I take daily, and double up on during times I feel sluggish."
4,A must if you take scrip meds,Great natural product. Excellent for doing a liver cleanse. Needed if you have to take prescription medications or have any bad habits :)Solomon Neuhardt
5,Great product,This product does a great job cleaning my liver gently and effectively. I didn't experience adverse reactions as with other liver cleansing products. I felt an increased sense of well being and energy after 2 weeks.
5,Nothing quite like it for rusted stuck fasteners,"This item was one of a trio of Kroil products is used as a surprise Christmas gift for my husband. Having just the right tool or product for a task or project is something he takes pride in, so this gift blew him away. He is probably the only guy in the state of Ohio who found this under the Christmas tree."
5,Great Gun Cleaner,"Kroil is great for cleaning guns and getting the carbon ring out of the chamber in a 22cal rimfire and cleaning the action,"
2,Didn't do the job,I was told that this product with get beneath rust making it easy to remove. I didn't have any luck with it for that purpose. I can still use it as a lubricant though.
3,Kano Kroil Penetrating Oil,I bought the Kroil Oil for the porpose of removing burnt powder fowling from rifle barrels. It smells like kerosene and works very well at cleaning powder from rifle barrels. I don't think it is any better than products like Hoppes Elite and the Kroil Oil has quite a smell.I haven't tried it as a break loose penetrating oil where it is supposed to excel.
1,disappointed,"Your web site announces Kano as penetrating oil, but you don't tell the consumer that it's a dangerous material, and that is essential to the customer rights. Because, later in customs the real problem begins trying to transport a product that is classified by IATA as Hazard Class/Packing Group: 3, III and very dangerous to transport by air, even the liquid form.The consumer must be aware of this limitations; for example, as some Web Sites announce that any aerosol can't be sent by air; in this case the material ""per se"" it's Flammable liquid, n.o.s. (Aliphatic Alcohols, Petroleum Destillates)The buying experience was very bad. Never, we have had this response from a seller: ""the problem is with the shipper in Florida""Your web site didn't do what is supposed to do to the customer, INFORM.The rights of the customer come first, and revealing all this small and peculiar details that we are aware know, show the other side of the story."
5,Kroil,The best penetrating oil on the market. I have used it to release siezed pistons. It will seipe through any tiny crevis.
5,Super Rust Dissolver,"Kano Kroil Penetrating Oil is without question the most effective penetrating oil in existence. I have used it to free up rusted and ""frozen"" parts that I thought were impossible to separate with penetrating oil. I was amazed when Kroil worked its magic. Great product from Amazon.Ray SiemerCincinnati, Ohio"
1,Pure Audacity,"I bought this CD on the basis of curiosity about what I thought would be some cool jazz interpretations of some of Stevie Wonders music.I was wrong and in fact I felt honestly insulted when I listened! Anyone with an ounce of musical integrity would be insulted by the shere lack of cohesion towards any attempt to groove or even musicality , Sloppy & immature come to mind. What were these guys thinking or feeling? Wondering what the Man himself would think if he heard it."
5,Charming Brit Pop,"A wonderful disc of Beatle-flavored pop songs, with other influences including XTC, Peter Gabriel, Blur and, of course, Paul McCartney.Any fan of highly melodic pop with clever lyrics and healthy doses of chamber orchestra should love the work of John Cunningham."
4,Excellent pop music,"John Cunningham does not have to be confused with another one of the same name who makes celtic music. Here's a pop singer songwriter from Liverpool, and if you like the music of the Zombies, Nick Drake or Elliott Smith, this is for you. ""Happy-go-unlucky"" is the kind of fine, subtle album that grows with each listen. With aerial, sweet, high vocals and melodies, it ends by enchanting you. The musical world of John Cunningham is secret and different from what we use to hear. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, it is an intimate experience to live if we love music."
3,Personalized shirt,"Shirt is less than stellar. Print was pretty, but the shirt they used was very thin. Would have been nice if it was a regular weight tank top, but it's not. The tank seems to be a cheaper, thinner one than expected, and therefore any bra worn under is seen clear as day. Not something you'd want to wear out in public, which is the exact reason I bought the thing. Perhaps I can wear it to bed..."
1,NO WAY! False advertising - don't be fooled!,"This is false advertising! This hammock doesn't include the stand! The picture clearly shows the hammock with a stand! I intend to file a claim. Don't be fooled, this is only the cloth."
5,Aren't We All Liars?,"What do we do when we can no longer bear the life we feel trapped in? How can we avoid hurting those who love us - and whom we care for - if we follow our own needs? Is there any redemption when we abandon family? And how can we escape lying to ourselves, let alone others?"
5,Cheryl - Colorado,I really like Bel Canto but loved The Patron Saint of Liars. So many times a notable author's follow-up book is not good (e.g. Sue Monk Kidd). Ann Patchett's book was lyrical and moving. You feel each of the characters deep in your soul. A most incredible book! A must read!
5,It's Sister Evangeline.,"Folks, Rose isn't the patron saint of liars; Sr. Evangeline is. She is surrounded by people who withhold the truth, lie, or cover up, yet she loves them without reservation, sees through their pain to their truths, says those who see themselves as saints are 'out of the running,' and knows she has flaws of her own. And in case we still didn't get it, the author gives her the stigmata!"
5,Patron Saint of Liars,"What a great read! This was a departure from my usual type of book but I had read another Patchett book, thoroughly enjoyed it, so thought I'd try another. Couldn't put it down. Wonderful character development, plot, and storyline. Can't wait to read more by this talented author."
4,A good read,"This is my first experience with Ann Patchett and won't be my last. I loved her writing style even though the character development didn't always make sense. Why did everyone love Rose so much when she was so cold and shut down? The explanation for leaving Thomas, and her mother whom she loved deeply, didn't make sense to me. The story however was beautifully written albeit sad. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but I think that had to do with more with finding the Lorraine character incredibly annoying. I'm anxious to read my next Patchett novel."
3,Male Readers Beware,"I'm beginning to think that there are novels written by women for women. Ann Patchett's debut novel, ""Patron Saint of Liars"" must be one of them. I felt nary a whit of sympathy for, nor gained a dram of understanding about protagonist Rose Clinton, whose behavior toward the men who love her defies either.Patchett does provide an interesting look into the world of homes for unwed mothers (which in itself is an ironic setting), a no doubt declining industry in a world that has become progressively more tolerant toward what are now called single mothers. But even that connection is disappointing after a prelude that implies that the setting may have some ultimately redemptive qualities, which it didn't, at least for Rose.Two-and-a-half stars, rounded up to three for the look at homes for unwed mothers."
5,Beautiful,"I read Bel Canto and was blown away by Ann Patchett. Such heart-breakingly beautiful writing, I wouldn't care if she was writing about the mating habits of slugs because I know her writing would make it wonderful. I followed Bel Canto with Patron Saint of Liars and was not disappointed, only affirmed. She quickly became one of my favorite authors. I could see the clouds rolling lazily over Habit, Kentucky. I could smell the grass. I didn't want it all to end."
4,A Rose by any other name would stay put.,"Themes throughout the book - Those Who Stay and Those Who Leave, resonate, particularly through Son's narrative. The placement of the story is unique and offers a look at those who can neither stay nor leave, but are simply waiting. But while I was touched by sections of the story (particularly through Son's narrative), I was frustrated by Rose's actions. I reread her narrative and had a difficult time understanding the extremeness of her actions - what function in her past told her to run instead of facing those who loved her - and what would catapult her into the life she chose to lead. Other than that, the novel is lovely, soft and warm and sad. There's a lot to discuss. I look forward to reading more Patchett."
5,great story and very well written,a very believable and heart-warming but dark story. I couldn't put the book down...excellent character development. I was sorry to see it end.
5,Patron Saint of Liars,This is Ann Patchett at her best. This book has much to say -- I hated to see it end.
4,Engrossing with a poor ending,I devoured this book because I became completely engrossed in the story and characters. I didn't like the ending because it didn't resonate for me. I would recommend it.
3,A little frustrating,The book definitely kept my attention throughout. The ending was frustrating for me in that it didn't make sense as to what the characters did in relation to one another.
1,"If I could give it a zero, I would.","I could write many lines about how much I disliked this novel, but I would be taking up too much of your time. I really did not care for the writing style. It seemed way too slow for me."
2,Poor Dialouge/Not Patchett's Best,"I read this book because Bel Canto was so excellent, but I came away disapointed. The dialouge is flat and not believable, it kept distracting me from the story. The premise for the book is great, but the story falls flat. Rose, the main character is impossible to sympathise with after the first few chapters, she is cold and basically unloving, and thus unlovable. Her second husband Son's reasons for loving her and tolerating her distance and utter lack of warmth are unclear. The climax of the novel is in the first third of the book, then it just kind of plods along, leaving you wondering how this could possibly have been written by the same author who wrote Bel Canto."
2,Not near as good as Bel Canto,"This book just wasn't all that good. It was long and slow and pretty simple. I didn't find the writing particularly inspiring either. After Bel Canto, I am disappointed, since that was such an exciting and beautiful book. I finished this whole book but I never really liked it that much."
4,Loved it!,"I love Ann Patchett's usage of language.The characters were so complicated and hard to relate to:especially Rose. However, Patchett is able to entice us into her story."
1,Completely unlikeable main character,"This book is awful! Rose is completely selfish and self absorbed. She does whatever she wants with no regard to anyone's feelings and ends up running away from all her problems. Other than an unlikeable main character, there really is no plot and the ending is flat. Save your money and time."
3,Great story until the end,"I had never read anything by Ann Patchett before and chose this for our book club's book of the month because it sounded interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed Patchett's writing style and found the characters engaging. The plot was unique and intriguing. I was just so disappointed in the ending! I wasn't looking for a ""happy ending,"" but I wanted closure and I felt like I got left hanging."
2,Pretty good story but hated the ending,"I was enjoying this book and how it was written but the ending ruined the whole thing for me. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who wants to read it, so I'll just say I felt I was left hanging."
4,Couldn't put it down,I loved this book. Ann Patchett has such a way with words. I loved how she didn't end the book by making everything fall into place. Still many unanswered questions. Definitely a good read.
4,Very good,"I was initally not interested in the book my neighborhood club chose but couldn't put it down once I started.It would be nice to see a sequle to see where Son, Rose and Sissy end up in 10 years."
2,Why Do People Love It?,"This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal. It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone. I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated."
2,I would like a different ending...,"I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got. I could understand why Rose decided to leave California. I was glad that she decided to keep the baby. Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter. The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me. I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched. I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening. At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal. As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title. It was frustrating and disappointing. Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth."
2,"Henriksen, Tomerson true good sports in making ""Spitfire""","This movie is so bad it's hilarious! Every new scene will leave you hysterical. Lance Henriksen (Aliens) plays a James Bond knock-off and Tim Tomerson (Trancers) a drunk sports reporter who are both somehow involved with a gymnist. How they keep it together has to be the fact they are getting paid to. And I'm not so sure of that from watching their faces. I know I see them smiling when they can't help themselves. They are the saving grace of this ""no way"" movie. Another plus is a scene where Robert Patrick (X-Files) is a gum-chewing agency man with a gun pulled on Mr. Henriksen's spy guy character. He has no lines but he is definitely grinning. If you can see this movie free, good. If you want to make it a financial tryout, make it a cheap one."
3,Make sure you specify color!,Even though the order says it is for Chrome Mirror I got a clear lens and it wasn't shipped from DoroSports but from a different seller. I can use the clear one but I was really looking for the darker tint.
1,Motorola SLVR L7 OEM,Received the item in 14 days. I tried w/ on my motorola v3xx. I called from a home line and and all I heard are statics and noises with this headset. The material is so cheap that I doubt it's OEM. I have to return this since I can't use it.
2,"If you want to be afraid of herbs, read this book!","Very few helpful suggestions in this book. The authors are Pharmacists. They list side effects of herbs that would happen to maybe 1 in a billion people. They state that dandelion can cause, ""Skin irritation... blockage of the digestive or biliary tract, gallbladder inflammation, gallstones"" but on the SAME page say that it is used for ""digestive complaints, gallbladder problems, to stimulate bile production"". Now, why would you use a plant that helps with gallbladder problems if it causes them?? (by the way, it does not, I have much experience with this plant and have never had any side effects, nor has anyone I have spoke with). This book will do nothing but make you paranoid of about using herbs. If you want a good book, get ""The New Age Herbalist"" or anything by Rosemary Gladstar, Dr. James A. Duke or James Green. Peterson Field guides are also quite good."
3,USEFUL BUT BRIEF,"A COUPLE OF POINTS ARE MADE BY OTHER REVIEWERS I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS. LINKING PHARMACISTS TO THE GREEDY, UNSCRUPLOUS PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS IS DOING MOST PHARMACISTS AN INJUSTICE. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE WILLING TO USE ANY REMEDY TO PROVIDE OUR PATIENTS RELIEF FROM THEIR SYMPTOMS, PROVIDED IT HAS BEEN PROVEN SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. PROVEN IS THE KEY WORD HERE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY WELL RUN AND DOCUMENTED STUDIES PROVING THE BENEFITS OF MANY HERBAL PRODUCTS BUT FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE THERE SEEMS TO BE 6 OR 8 THAT ARE POORLY DESIGNED, OFFER ANECDOTES RATHER THAN PROOF, OR COME TO DUBIOUS CONCLUSIONS. THAT SAID, JUST BECAUSE A STUDY IS NOT SCIENTIFIC DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE HERBAL REMEDY IS NOT HELPFUL. AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WE MUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION... ""FIRST DO NO HARM..."". FOR A MORE BALANCED, MORE COMPLETE PICTURE SEE THE AUTHORS' WORK ENTITLED ""PROFESSIONAL'S HANDBOOK OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES""."
4,a very comprehensive work,"First off, this is written by two pharmacologist, so they have a reason to scare you - medical prescriptions are BIG business for pill producers and doctors alike. They do not wish you to find there are things you can create and take yourself ( and with often much better results!!) because that cuts into their money!! So accept this book as written with prejudices. That said, it is still a good reference work for people wanting to know more about herbs. It details over 300 herbs, how they interact with drugs, a glossy for medical terms so you can full understand what they are say.It has a nice little box that tells you why people take the herb, interactions, important points to remember, doses, what current research shows, other names and references for further reading.A good work, when used as a companion piece for more balanced works and herbs and their usages.Also a good reference work for writers using herbs in their books."
3,Fair book,"This book is a fount of information, but rather as a reference than as a ""how-to"", which is kind of what I was looking for. I was looking for something that would tell me what herbs to use for certain ""ailments"" and how to prepare them for use--such as for a tea or tincture, etc. While this book may say it can be used as such, it gives no instruction as to how to prepare."
3,Herbal medicines,Great guide to using Herbs instead of drugs. Aso shows which herbs NOT to mix together. I use it often as a reference and guide
2,was it updated?,"I read this book from start to finish, then started over again to work through examples on my Mac OSX Lion. I am about 1/3 through the book the second time and am figuring out that NetInfo is not part of Lion. Since the earlier version was written a few years ago I am wondering if having an extended section on this topic is maybe outdated? Again I am just getting started with Unix so perhaps I am too dumb to know any better. In any case I am using the book and doing web searches to figure out equivalent material for my OSX Lion. But sometimes it is good to be able to take a book and use examples on the computer."
3,An interesting story about the history-making U.S. warship,"This is a very readable, if somewhat choppy, history of a fascinating warship. Most people are probably unfamiliar with the story of the Oregon's gallant cruise from San Francisco to Havana in order to particpate in one of the two decisive naval battles which helped bring the U.S. a relatively quick and easy victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898. Because of the length of the voyage, American leaders realized the necessity of a two-ocean navy as well as the urgent need for the building of a canal across the isthmus of Panama. Sternlicht's story seems to dwell somewhat on insignificant details (such as the hullabaloo surrounding the Oregon's launching) while glossing over some other important areas, such as the experiences of the crewmen on board. But overall it's a very readable, interesting history of a warship that was instrumental in defining the direction of growth and ultimate destiny of the American Navy during the 20th century."
2,JUST A NOVEL ABOUT ROULETTE,"This book is a must read to the people who want to know facts that happened worldwide. If you are looking a book just for relax and patience you can buy it... but if you are looking a book to learn to play and beating the Roulette search another book.This book is good just for the people who loves to play Roulette as a hobby and not as a bussiness.In fact, the book related tables from a page to other, this is boring and it take out emotion of the book, besides the tables are confusing and misunderstable.The book is divided in sections about fact that happened worldwide, and it takes almost all the book just to tell a strategy that is just write in one chapter."
4,Works great (or so I've been told),"This harness stays in place and allows good thrusting action. As for the bullet, it doesn't really work for me from a location standpoint. I usually don't use it. Since this is a ""beginner"" kit, the dildos are on the small and thin side, which is ok for getting started, but you will need a bigger ring to accomodate a bigger toy. Note: also purchased Tantus Acute and it fits in the ring of this harness."
4,Just what the name suggests,"This is a great item for the beginner. A good item for a great price, especially for those on a tight budget."
4,Looks nice,have not convinced wife to use with me but single play so far is ok the small is really small
4,Great starter kit,"My partner and I have had great success with this harness.Pros:-You can just open the box and get started!-The straps are really easy to adjust.-The placement of the straps make for great (though not perfect) control and maneuverability.-It's comfortable to wear.-The price/value.Cons:-The material of which the dildos are composed attracts lint and pet hair as soon as they're exposed to open air. This is probably a trade-off for the safety and wash-ability of the dildos.-The vibrator is not easy to use. The position of the button is awkward and it's hard to apply enough pressure to the button when the vibrator is in the harness.-The larger of the two dildos is not long enough to easily accommodate certain positions, especially if the receiving partner has an ample rear. We're getting a bigger dildo soon.Overall, I would recommend this product to any lesbian couple whom are embarking on their maiden voyage into the world of strap-ons."
4,Not Bad!,"While not Watt-Evans best work in Ethshire it's generally a good read. There arn't so many comic elements as are found in some of his other Ethshire novels. It's more of a historical account of the Night of Madness, as told by one young noble. If you are a fan of the Ethshire series this is a must read. If you've never read them before, go find ""The Misenchanted Sword"" and ""With a Single Spell"". ""Spell of the Black Dagger"" is also tops. If nothing else enjoy the magical land of the Ethshire novels."
5,Every Dog has his Day,"The book was the Bomb! I loved how Montel got his just deserts at the end. Sasha was such a fool when it came to him, that I was praying she woke up soon and she did!I can relate to the story because the same thing has happened to me, over and over again. Until one day, I decided to take a new lease on life and wake up and smell the s$#! that my ex-fiance was shoveling!The lesson in love is that it is okay to play the fool, it happens to all of us! But it is not okay if you keep letting that happen to you. It's like Sasha said ""Either you keep eating the rice or you make a new batch"""
3,Editorial issues and sometimes Confusing.,"I thought the book had good points, a little young in voice though. Mispellings and confusing factors kept me from zipping through it - I found myself having to read certain parts again to figure what was going on."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I enjoyed the book, I think it was very dramatic, I loved how everything connected. My favorite part was the Vicki Rake show. That part showed the audacious humor and knowledge of things that go down when a threesome is acknowleged. I think you have skills. The characters were real and they reminded me so much of the drama I myself have been through in the past! Good Read"
1,And that's for effort,"Snowed in my opinion should've been sent back to the author to be re-written. I really tried to get into the story, which was boring from page one, but the author failed to reel me in. Between the grade school phrases to the stupidity and the underdevelopment of the characters, every time I tried to read Snowed, I snored.I met the author at HBF and after her sales pitch of Snowed and because I like to support African American authors, I feel like she mis-represented the book. It isn't hardly as juicy as she described it. I will be donating this to my local library but that isn't to say that I won't buy another book from this author. Everybody deserves a second chance. I just hope she has it together by then."
3,"DECENT, not terrible nor great.","This book was DECENT, it's about Sasha and her homegirls lives. Sasha's high school bf broke her heart, and when she was older they met again and she took him back. He still brings nothing but drama and confusion to her life but she can't stop loving him. There's other drama in this book too, but nothing sooo juicy that keeps you on the edge of your seat. At some points it was extremely boring and I felt like I had to force myself to read it. Overall DECENT read."
5,Bliss,"Perfect background music for.... so many things I probably shouldn't mention here! Anyways, this is definately Santana's best, buy it, download it, somehow aquire it, and enjoy it. And as the other reviews note, if you like the new Santana pop stuff, don't bother with this. It's not even in the same genre."
3,The first step in the wrong direction,"This album is vastly overrated by critics on Amazon, I'm afraid. Outside of the exceptional percusion and drumming, this album lacks the intensity of Santana's previous efforts and is an uninspiring listen. For some reason, Santana decided to move into the realm of jazz but instead of cranking out the perfect combination of jazz and latin sounds, this album comes accross as the sort of cheesy jazz you hear in a modern jazz club. It's not horrible by any means, but there is a fine line between good and bad jazz and Carlos is walking right down the center of it. Stick to Carlos' first three albums for some of the best latin music ever recorded and if you want jazz then it's time to delve into Miles Davis and John Coltrane."
5,Better than Supernatural or Abraxas,"There are so many other reviews here that say exactly what I want to say about this music so I will not add much. I think it is much better than Santana's most popular and excellent albums, ""Supernatural"" and ""Abraxas"". There are no hit songs here, just the original Santana band hitting their musical peak in an inspired work of intense power and beauty. My favorite tracks are ""Stone Flower"" (#8) and ""La Fuente Del Ritmo (#9), both of strong Brasilian flavor, and ""Waves Within"" (#2) - I dare you to figure out the meter this one is in. I don't care much for Track #5 and 6, but everything else is close to perfection."
3,Anthropological look at Islamic Law,"Rosen brings his deep familiarity with both the fields of law and anthropology to bear in an anthropological examintion of the legal practice of kadis and their courts in Moroccan society. His documentation of the cultural logic and practice of Islamic law is fascinating and worth reading although it should be criticized that he too presumptuously seems willing to apply his insights into Moroccan society to Islamic Law as such. In this sense, there is much to be learned from Rosen about the Moroccan cultural and social institutions of Islamic Law, but much less to learn with regard to Islamic law as an intellectual discourse as such."
4,Interesting perspective,"We found this book while reading Rick Steves' book, Travel as a Political Act. Worshiping in a suburban mainline church in California prepares us to read the Bible with certain biases. This book presents a different way to interpret the Bible, what it is like to be oppressed and read the words and experience hope. While a little dated at this time, since it was published in 1984, the views he presents are thought provoking and stimulate interesting conversations in our book study."
3,Casca conquers but not brilliantly,"Although historically accurate - and the author here seems to have taken great pains on historic detail, more than can be said for some of his others - the story appears at times disjointed as though more than one person wrote this. The return of Casca to the lands of the Teotec keeps the interest going but it isn't the best written story. I liked the chapter he was in the Spanish dungeon, however, and this was the best written part."
3,"Good message, way too much fluff","The message is good, but the presentation is just too fluffy. I enjoyed the speakers a lot but got sooo tired of the girl fluffing around throughout the movie. Is there some way I can get a version without her? The message is presented with too much new agey music and scenery. The message sort of gets lost in that. If I didn't love the message I would have turned it off in three minutes.Great quotes!"
3,"Good message, slightly disappointing delivery.","This was a bit disappointing. Not for the lack of truth in the message but for the lack of depth in the commentary and the repetitiveness. I think the message would have much better impact with more information. I feel like this was an oversimplified way of providing a potentially powerful message. The ""Anastasia"" series by Vladimir Megre is much better at providing this message, and also ""Kymatica""."
5,You need to know,"Everybody should know 3 magic words . I wish that humanity find way yo understand themselves and world where they come from . Rear wisdom is told quietly with fiew words and this one is told in univeral anguage, pisture and words that touch sole ."
3,Not what I had hoped,"While I dig the message, this 'cute' little movie did not tell me anything I didn't know already. I find it interesting, at best, as to who the ""masters"" were that were interviewed for this film. I have been on the spiritual path for around 30 years, I guess, and I recognized (knew of) 3 of the people that they interviewed. There is no Ram Dass, there is no Deepak Chopra, not even Eckhart Tolle. Even Amma was only on there giving a hug.If you are going to make a movie dealing with this genre, then you need to have Masters.I'm sure those that they interviewed feel they are 'there', but I disagree.As was said in another review, there is too much 'fluff' and not nearly enough substance.In my opinion..."
3,I am ...,"It was an interesting video that gave a really interesting view about living in today's world. If you tend to have a closed mind, trust me this is not for you. You may go insane with laughter or overwhelming fear. But don't knock it until you really see it. You might have to watch it more than three times to get the message it is trying to give you. And you may not have the capacity to believe it ( I don't Yet, but it makes sense on a certain level). The video itself was okay, it's documentary approach was weird. It's Believe-ability is up to you."
2,Couldn't seee it!!!,Couldn't watch it my laptop was not listed in devices. I should have checked first. Wish I had known that.
2,Fluff with little substance,"I really liked the secret, what the bleep are we here for and the shift movies. This movie came across as fluff. I honestly feel you would be much better off reading the book than seeing this movie. The book was inspired. The movie felt like a money grab. The movie is only 50 min long and in that time it doesn't say much. I hope I don't sound negative I'm not judging the movie's theme or ideals. For me it was a very underwhelming experience. Maybe being a fan of the book I expected a lot from the movie."
2,Good Bits but does not Hang Together,"Good Bits but does not Hang Together Ablan is obviously a good 'techie' but has problems in communicating his ideas. I do not blame him but the sloppy Editing - Sams should hire a new Editor. Not for those starting off with Java & Inet projects. Typos, the CD has wrong chapters & after a few days gave up in trying to get the JIF examples working. There is no documentation / instructions on how to get it up & running (not in the book/CD). What a waste, as looked quite interesting.No discussion on Servlets vers Applets et al, or the limitations of doing it his way. Advice to Jerry Ablan: get a new editor, cover Servelets & reissue the book Note to SAMS (you seem to be more interested in $$$$bucks~$$$ for profits, too much sloppy & poor editing,compare that with O'Reilly; if I see book released by you versus O'Reilly - GUESS which pedigree I'll buy !!)"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"With the hope of countering my tendencies to avoid most ""new"" fiction I purchased this book thinking I could be proven wrong; to be shown that most literature that enters the marketplace in the 21st century is not a thoughtless waste of time. The first 60 or so pages of this book had promise, but then it revealed itself to be a forced, semi-imaginative and uninspired mass of pages. I feel somewhat bad for saying this but it cannot be helped. Instead I picked up ""The Goalies Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" by Peter Handke, which is a tidy, superior and exceptional novel. Sorry Tom."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this. I love Paul Auster's 'New York Trilogy' and Mark Haddon's 'CuriousIncident' and was expecting similar mind games. But 'Remainder' didn't work for me, I'mafraid. The writing feels forced and maddeningly artificial. The dialogue is plain bad. Thesluggish pace means you're always a few steps ahead of the narrator. Which is never a goodplace to be. A disappointment, sorry."
2,Not a pleasant read,"I kind of got the existential point the author was making here about how all our lives are redundant, inauthentic cycles of meaningless events, blah blah blah. I guess in the end I fall into the category of readers who likes a cohesive plot. Just because you are trying to be existential does not mean you can just string a bunch of events together without any thought to the book as a whole. You don't have to answer every mystery for me, but the book started out with such an interesting premise and so many promising mysteries to be solved that I was disappointed when none -- not one -- was revealed. I enjoyed the beginning third or so of the book, but once the narrator started re-enacting a series of meaningless (or were they? I guess we'll NEVER KNOW) events, it became so tedious a read I began to feel that I, like the narrator, was going insane. Possibly that was the author's point. Well done if so, but it didn't make for a very enjoyable read."
2,Where's the plot?,"I agree with alot of the other reviewers here, there was no plot to this book. I was wondering if there was some deeper meaning or some hidden symbolism, but could not connect it to anything. This leaves the reader disappointed and wanting more, but not in a good way. The book drags in the middle and then picks up some steam 2/3 of the way through, but never really climaxes. It just repeats and repeats, maybe thats what the books about, everything we do has already been done before."
2,Is There A Point to All of This?,"The critics (or at least some of them) find this novel to be brilliant but I disagree. The author devotes 300 pages to the protaganist's quest to feel ""real"" by wasting a fortune ""reenacting"" a series of events. We never find out what's wrong with this guy - is it brain damage from his trauamtic injury or is he just a self-absorbed creep who now has the money to indulge himself? His obsession culminates in several deaths, which appear not to bother him in the least. I get the feeling the author wrote this book just because he could, not because he had anything to say. This one is all style and no substance."
2,Not what I expected....,"I was slightly disappointed when I read this book, cause I was hoping for so much more. The beginning started off pretty interesting, but the re-enactments became so repetitious I was bored to death! I think the idea was to make it exhausting so that the reader could relate with the main character and his mindset, but it was very nerveracking to read. Once I got the final re-enactment I was so thankful that the book was about to be over. Not a terrible read overall, but certainly not the greatest."
2,"Read Steven Milhauser's ""Martin Dresler"" Instead","The reviews had described it as a book that dealt with philosophy, but it struck me as ""Matrix"" pop culture-like philosophizing. If it was supposed to make me question the nature of my world, it completely failed to do so. In its place I would recommend, Steven Milhauser's ""Martin Dresler,"" a book with more emotionally complex characters and describes the same kind of obsession with recreating the world in a way that is far more charming and engaging. I could not ever recommend this book to anyone."
4,Creative Malice,"I found this novel to be a completely effective, and thoroughly entertaining modern existential gem. It sparkles with wit and talent; It was dark, gruesome, hilarious, bizarre, and utterly original. The story of a misanthropic, almost Dostoyevskian victim of falling debris, mental imbalance, amnesia, and an evil imagination; a man turns injury into creative malice, trying to artificially rebuild a broken memory by staging the world around him until reality itself turns wretched, broken and false. See it as metephor, expressionism, or a claim on man's soul, vision, or insight...but see it as a comedy first, because it truly is one of the more risky and out-there comic takes on modern humanity I've yet come across. Virtuosic but somehow simplistic, a great summer read you won't soon forget."
2,It would have been better if it was written by someone else.,I was intrigued by the idea behind this book but the writing really let me down. It was drawn out and boring. I just didn't care. Chuck Palahniuk would have done a much better job.
5,Short Review,"If George Perec's ""Life A Users Manual"" was made into Situationalist Art and then recorded as a novel"". It is a meditation on compulsion, on obsession, on the need to control. The is one of the books that has stayed with me, as a part of my mental landscape for over a year, and has now forced me to write a review."
3,Read when you have nothing better.,The book shouldn't have been this long. It'd have been perfect had it been shortened to less than 100 pages. Beyond that it really got tiresome to see the same experiences and similar foreshadows that didn't quite meet expectations.
5,Terrific,"I was impressed by McCarthy's inventiveness in this book. He took an odd idea and made it work -- just like his main protagonist -- through wonderful imagery and prose. This is one of the most interesting works of the early 21st Century. However, whether it stands the test of time remains to be seen."
5,A Great mixture of Mountain and Cream!!!,"This is a must have for any hard rock fan. Leslie West is always great, whether it is with Mountain, solo, or as part of West, Bruce, & Laing. A great combination of Leslie West and Jack Bruce. You have to listen to this one."
1,RE-ISSUE IS NOT REMASTERED,"I wanted a remastered copy because the origial had lousy bass. What you, Amazon, listed as a remastered copy was just a re-issue of the original. I sent it back, got a refund, and a $10 credit toward my next purchase at Amazon. Suffice it to say, this is a terribly recorded CD and I don't like it at all."
2,For Diehard Fans Only,"If you are looking for tunes like ""Mississippi Queen"" which have cool guitar solos and and hummable tunes, then this is not the album for you. HOnestly, these songs sound like tracks that were left off an album because they were so-so. None of them are memorable, though the bass playing is very nimble and inventive. In fact, I found myself paying more attention to the bass playing than anything else.On the other hand, if you are a diehard West fan, you might enjoy hearing this. I would try other West efforts before going with this one. Sorry to be negative, but this one clearly did not do it for me."
2,WHY DON'TCHA PASS THIS BY?,"After seeing Mountain & West Bruce and Laing in concert, and following Leslie's solo career, I believe this is the worst of their efforts. There's only two good tracks on this album. Pollution Woman and Out into the fields. The rest of the songs are hard to listen to. If you like these artists, check out Mountain, Cream and their solo work up to and after this album."
2,"okay in its day, in its way","I bought this when it was originally released. I can't remember exactly why. After the first four or so obligatory listenings I only ever played Jack Bruce's ""Out In The Fields"", which I still remember fondly. Odd that it's still in print. Someday I'll dust it off and play ""Out In The Fields"" again.(The review inflation at this site is ridiculous.)"
5,Salomon Rossi Gem,"The real gem on this disc is the Salomon Rossi Suite. This relatively unknown Renaissance composer is given a fresh interpretation through Lukas Foss' arrangement. The movement for harp and timpani is especially attractive, but the entire Suite shows how a contemporary vision of older music can be a truly engaging listening experience."
5,Counterstools,"Better than I had originally expected. Sturdy, with a lovely antiqued finish. So glad we purchased these."
3,OK Strappy Sandals,"I like the color and the design of these sandals. However, they are not very comfortable. The pink dye around the ankle straps peeled off the first time I put them on -quite unexpected for Charles David shoes."
3,sexy but unconfortable on the toes,"They LOOK GREAT_ but hurt like hell across the toes. I haven't tried to ""wear them out' yet so maybe that will give a little -"
4,"Snort, snort, chuckle, chuckle","Bought this for a recent trip to Belgium. Actually gave some really useful insights into how the country works--added a layer to the trip beyond the usual tourist guides. As funny a writer as I have read, wish he would publish more books. A fair amount of British cultural references obscure to this Yank reader, but they actually added more color to the writing. Very much recommended"
4,Ironman Watch Review,"The picture on the web makes the display look like the numbers are much brighter than they actually are. I didn't think I would like the black backgound but running with this watch under bright conditions, the numbers are very easy to read. The only complaint I have is that sometimes I don't press the lap button hard enough and I find that I haven't changed laps at my mile markers."
4,Very nice watch,It's a great watch with tons of features. Sometimes I forget which button is the light and it's not the one on the front. Anyway I end up pushing all the different buttons in the dark.
2,pretty much unreadable,"can't read the black watch face. when I'm running or biking and don't want to find indiglo button, I can't see the numbers. I generally go thru one of the Ironman watches every year, so I've had a lot of experience with them. Love the watches, hate this model."
2,Take a second look,"I bought this for my daughter a few years ago, I was really enthusiastic about it...but upon arrival and after assembly I realized its' little stool is too little for any child mature enough to actually use this item. Before ordering I did some reading of previous reviews and do remember some other customers complaining about the same thing. ( Should've paid attention!). One more thing, there was also a mix-up in it's pricing---after ordering, e-bay had to cancel my order because of a price difference between price posted and actual price. ( I had to pay more. ) Over all bad item and bad transaction. Well, you can't win them all they say!"
2,Kind of a gamble,"Our Vizsla (who likes to be warm at all times) hasn't really cared for it, she climbed inside a few times after the bed arrived, but hasn't really used it since."
5,Great dog cave bed,This appears to be a well made product - and my dog loves it. She usually sleeps right at the front instead of tucked back inside - but maybe she does in the middle of the night and I just don't see her. I have seen her on the very top too - so it is also versitile. Fast shipping. I am very pleased - and so is my 20lb. Boston Terrier.
5,One Happy Pup!,"Wow! What a great dog bed! My wife was the skeptic, but was she wrong. The dog took to it right off, and can't be parted with it now. She charges right into the puch, does her round about dance and snuggles in for a warm comfy rest. You got to get your dog one of these beds, they'll love it!"
2,Plastic tube comes out,"My dogs didn't know how to use it. But beside that fact, the plastic tube that holds the cover up is coming out of the fabric and can stick my dogs. The soft fabric falls out without the dogs chewing on it."
3,Not bad...,"I ordered this product because we use it to make a salsa a lot. The pepper was nice & hot, as well as flavorful. However, it was shipped in a grocery sack, which wasn't impressive, but hey, it's a bulk purchase, so I can accept the unimpressive packaging. What I cannot accept, and the reason I'm placing my next order with another company is that there was a lot of grit or dirt or something other than crushed red pepper that I felt should have been filtered out. It didn't ruin our salsa, however, we did receive some complaints, which to us is never acceptable. I believe you can do better, but the favor and heat was excellent though."
3,Not what I expected,"It was a decent tent. I bought it because I thought it would have a high ceiling, but the loft took away a good foot. Also, you can't zip up the windows if it rains and there is no screen for the door. Definately not for cold weather but fairly easy to set up."
1,Sad delusions cost lives,"Wow, the author believes the germ theory is wrong. And vaccines cause autism.A Danish study of more than half a million children showed no link between measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism. (google that sentence to find the facts). Yes, that's a half a million kids.At the same time because of these fears, parents are not vaccinating their kids. What happens? In 2006 an epidemic of mumps breaks out in the Midwest, hundreds of kids got sick. Mumps is not a laughing matter. The illness can be more serious and cause meningitis or encephalitis, deafness, or sterility.Parents, if you care about your kids, don't say you haven't been warned.If the author doesn't believe in vaccines, how did polio disappear from Western societies? How did smallpox disappear? Anyone can choose to be wilfully ignorant, but to embrace ignorance despite bountiful evidence to the contrary AND to put our loved ones in danger?"
2,poor value,"I had read reviews of other videos in the series and this matches up with most others. This video is very short at 30 minutes (I did know this prior to ordering). The actual video is not too bad but the narrative is extremely lackluster. I do know the locations and the production could have been so much more informative. They did the hard part with the filming, why not add a helpful voice over? My guess is that the producers want you contact the travel agency whose logo and website appears onscreen endlessly. Why not tell people that some of the scenes were shot at the Aodhi Hotel at Kumbhalgarh for example? While there is a passing shot of the name on a gatepost the voice over could have been so much better and informative in this and many other similar aspects of the journey. Such a shame. Better to buy some good guideboooks, read Tripadvisor and see some free Youtube videos than buy this"
3,good price,"This battery is weaker than the one that came with my ericsson phone, however for the price, great product."
5,euphoric,"this is the coolest book ive ever read. i think its the joint smokers bible. its so funny everyone knows someone who breaks a rule or breaks the rules themselves.its about time someone wrote these traditional rules down.i love the line on the back,""SIMON SEZ; SPARK IT UP"" , I do everytime i get the chance. thanks simon"
4,Good for the price,"This kayak was a good entry into the sport for a novice like me. It's a good value for the price. If I had it to do over again, I might buy 2 one-person inflatables instead; my paddling partner and I haven't managed to coordinate very well so far.I have the following complaints:1) It doesn't have handles in the back or on the sides. This makes it more awkward than it needs to be to carry with two people.2) The fins are too flexible. No matter how I roll it, they always seem to come out bent. This makes the boat difficult to paddle in a straight line.3) The paddles fall out of the side clips when you're carrying the boat.The Coleman Rechargeable Pump and the ProSpirit 34"" Duffel both worked well with this product."
5,Highly recommended,"I took this out today and the entire family had a blast.Sure other people in plastic kayaks kind of thumbed their noses at us using this inflatable vs their fiberglass beasts but this was absolutely pure convenience. The rechargeable Coleman pump recommended by others here is very helpful. I think I was ready to go in <8 minutes. On the water, this did feel slower than a normal kayak but we were doing this to relax, not race and this more than did the job. The cove we launched this at was on the rocky side and I was afraid I might tear a hole underneath but it seems to have held up since we paddled around for 4 hours without any incident despite landing many times.Downside are the oars. I expected to get wet, not soaked when paddling. A bit more length or better designed couplers would work wonders. Next time I'm bringing some tape to lessen the drip.What can I say, well worth the money."
4,Good in all the ways that count,"Aloha! I've taken this to Kaimana and Ala Moana beaches only. No experience in rough waters. But so far, it's handled very very well. Goes fast, steers straight, slithers over small waves, very difficult to upset, easy to pump up and deflate/fold up. My kids like the climbing-on-and-jumping-off thing: no worries about slipping and hurting themselves on the soft surface. One caveat: the paddles are cheap. You'll need to pick up real ones. Overall: this is a very good kayak for the money. With very little prep, you're in the water and having fun. Mahalo."
4,Satisfied for a first time user,"Used this today after receiving it on Thursday. The delivery was great, but then the air pump has not arrive yet, so I got one from Walmart for the time being so that I can use the kayak.Overall it met my expectation, since this was my first time ever trying it out with my 4 years old son. He enjoyed it greatly.The only issue we had was that one of the paddle broke when I paddle against the strong wind, so that was no good. But then I knew this before I bought the kayak. A couple of reviews had already warned about the bad paddles.So I intend to get a good replacement.Overall, GREAT for beginner. Oh yes, I have a recommendation - do a few weeks of dum bells exercise for your arms before you get into it. Otherwise you will feel it the first day after you have tried the kayak."
2,good but not for serious paddlers,"Good for family recreational use. If you want to be a little more serious about paddling, this might not be good choice."
3,DO NOT PUT IN OCEAN!!!!!!,i got this kayak off [...] and when it came one of the foot supports kept deflating although the box says guaranteed not to deflate!REgardless i knew this wouldnt really affect my kayaking much. i took this thing to Venice beach in LA and a lifeguard came up to me and told me this thing doesnt look safe for the ocean but i can go ahead and take it in anyways. well i dragged it in and this thing filled up with water upon the first little wave. It definalely would have tossed me over and sunk before i would even pass the waves. so dont take it into the ocean. ill take it into the marina dock as the lifeguard instructed. o well thats what happens when you buy cheap stuff.
5,great toy,"Bought this kayak because we are new to kayaking and didn't want to spend $400+ for something we wouldn't use if we didn't like it. It's very easy to set up, my 11 yr old daughter and I can get this out and on the water in >10 min. using the rechargeable pump! It's very stable and 110% more comfortable than a kayak we rented on vacation! Don't be fooled by the picture, I'm almost 6' and fit comfortably in the rear seat.July 2007:Bought this Sept. 2006. Found it so good bought another double and a single so we have enough seats for everyone to go paddling. Recently took a friend and her 11y/o son out because she wanted something more stable than a canoe. Best recommendation is that after 1 afternoon of paddling with us, they ordered one for themselves and we try to take them out at least once a week. Would still recommend this Kayak without reservation!"
4,Sturdy and useable,"This lightweight kayak performs quite well. The bottom has decent reinforcement and one small fin for stability. Probably not suitable for really rough use such as around sharp rocks or snags, it's workable for mild use. It has good handling and comes pretty complete. Inflating takes some time but goes pretty smothly."
5,Good for Serious Paddlers,"This kayak is great. My wife and I use it regularly (with the battery-powered coleman inflator) in the Virginia Beach area. We take it down to the beach, inflate it, put the inflator in a waterproof bag, and go out on the ocean. This kayak has the capability of moving quickly. Even though it is inflatable, it's not hard to get up speed.It is sturdy and hasn't flipped over yet. It also has nets that hold your gear. The seating areas are comfortable. I am very glad I bought this."
4,similarities across cultures,"I read the book after I had read the movie and must agree that the movie told a more complete tale and Yes, a more likeable Jake Heke. However, I thought Duff did a good job in letting us into the minds of the characters. The unique style of writing facilitates that. I thought the book tried to give itself a happily ever after ending by the mother becoming the saint of the neighborhood.I came in with very little understanding or knowledge of New Zealand indigenous cultures. But I could not help but draw lines to other colonized peoples and cultures. Many of the things said about Maori culture, i could have said about my own and have heard said about my own culture as Filipinos."
3,Heavy handed,"An earlier reviewer who said skip this and see the film was on the mark.There's no doubting that this is an incredible powerful and important story (hence the 3 stars).However, to describe the writing as heavy handed is an understatement. Unlike Lee Tamahori (film's director)Duff seems incapable of letting his characters and the situations they find themselves speak for themselves. When you've created characters as powerful and memorable as Jake and Beth it's so unecessary. The fact that Duff feels the need to intersperse the narative with his simplistic moralising means by the end you find yourself spend more time wishing he'd shut up than worrying about the fate of the family.The film however is a masterpiece. Astonishingly powerful performances, and the direction pulls no punches whilst allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions. Duff could have learnt much, however from he's done since it doesn't seem that he did."
3,"Also confused by writing style, but powerful","Similar to some of the earlier reviewers, I found the writing style to be somewhat confusing (I think this is the first book without dialog that I have ever read). Still it is a powerful story, albeit one of the few cases where the movie works better than the book. The book treats Beth much less sympathetically at the beginning, and as more of a heroine toward the end; the movie has her as a strongpoint throughout. Why the film was moved from Rotorua to Auckland, and why some of the MAJOR plot points were altered so much, I don't know, but, in short, kudos to the scriptwriter, who took a powerful story from Duff and made it even more powerful. So, I give the movie six stars (on a five star scale) and the book three."
5,Better than the Clash's statement,"I'm referring to the 1980 Sandinista! album by the Clash, a 3-disc monstrosity that was the beginning of the end for a great band. Kristofferson, of all people, is the one who eulogized the Nicaraguan revolution brilliantly in popular music. Third World Warrior is the kind of in-your-face political album Sting wishes he could do. Kristofferson's band is one of the best country-rock aggregations ever assembled. Even when his voice starts to wear, Kristofferson can depend on the musicians. The songwriting tells a unified story, in which Kristofferson unashamedly makes the case for honoring the Nicaraguans who withstood, but only for a time, the brutality of the most powerful country on earth in the form of the Carter, Reagan, and Bush I terms. Kristofferson understands something has to be said about the destruction of a nation that helped its own people survive, and did no harm to the U.S. He says it well."
5,powerful and poetic,This is a brilliant collection of songs that tell a harsh truth. No one writes with the beauty and power of Kris Kristofferson and it is a shame that all to often his work has been overlooked. Whether he is writing of lost love or as in this case political and social injustice Kris cuts To The Bone (another great album) and writes with a passion and lyrical beauty unsurpassed by anyone.
3,Fairly Good,"There are a few songs on this album that make it worth having. The best of them is ""I Can't Touch the Sun."" This song is one of Dr. Hook's best."
5,Probably the best of the Dr. Hook albums,"I love everything about this album. It reminds me of when I was a kid. My father loved Dr. Hook. For me, growing up in a house where Dr. Hook records were always spinning, it's so much fun to go back and listen to them again as an adult.This album doesn't disappoint. My favorites include Cover of the Rolling Stone, Freakin' at the Freakers' Ball, and If I'd Only Come and Gone.Fans of Shel Silverstein's adult poetry will love Dr. Hook. Afterall, he is the lyrical genius behind this hard-partying freaks.Miss you dad. Thanks for the musical memories."
4,Great for traveling,"I got these on the subscription which makes them affordable . Gives me a good shave, has a lubricating edge that works fine for me .I like these for traveling or the gym , very light and easy to handle . I personally get a good week and a half of shaves out of each one ."
5,Dependable Performance Time after Time,This product has proven itself in our household for a very long time. The Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade does a great job and has a long service life. We keep one in the shower and use it as required and it continues to serve over an extended period of time with no shaving difficulties at all. We recommend it highly if one is looking for a reliable disposable razor.
5,Goodbye Electiric Shaver,"I switched to an electric razor 7 years ago because I could never find a razor that worked with my sensitive skin (can you say red bumps). Anyway, when my electric razor died at a hotel recently, this was the sample they gave me. I can't believe this is a disposable razor! Naturally, I researched all over again and tried everything (Sensor, Sensor Excel, Mach III, Mach III Turbo, Fusion, etc, etc) and this razor still comes out on top. You could say I'm a dedicated loyal customer now."
1,Never Ever Again,This is a horrible product. Bought theme at a local store and went home to shave with them for the first time and they just feel like they are pulling the hair out and not cutting. Mind you I just shaved the day before I purchased them and wanted to try something new. Man what a bad mistake it well never happen again.
1,Don't bother,It is good that these come in a pack of 8 because it took me several to get through a single shave. I won't be bothering with these again.
2,OK...for a disposible,"oh yeah, disposable razors are cool.... that's why they use them in prison! just kidding, as cheap plastic razors go, these are OK. Maybe good for travel. but if your looking for a great shave, no. spend the extra bucks for a cartridge-or ,even better, and old school safety razor."
1,Terrible!!!,"In my opinion, these are terrible razors. They are a disgrace to the gillette name. They are nothing like Mach 3. I bought these, considering the price alone. Well, I was disappointed to say the least. They created razor burn, which the package specifically says they will not do!! Can you believe that? I shave with lotion because my legs are highly sensitive to razor burn and feel itchy after shaving. I've found that lotion helps! But not with these razors. They should take them off the market."
3,How do You...,Received my Schick Xtreme razor free in the Sunday paper. Works fine. But how in *#* do you change blades ? No instruction book came with it. Please give me instructions.RDolli8239@aol.com
1,This is expensive compared to store prices at Sam's Club!!,"At the first glance, i relied on the actual price discount it shows.Product came in real quick time.Later when i went to Sam's club, i could figured out that this purchase was 50% higher the price/unit.For the first time i am disappointed at my Amazon purchase."
5,good razor,"probably the best disposible razor made, IMO. Tried the more expensive ones, but always come back to these. a good price for these razors and quick secure ship."
3,Just Ok,Typical disposable razor. Is pretty dull feeling by the end of the week and is very unforgiving on problem spots on your face...if the hair grows weird or whatever.
4,So far the best razors I have used.,"I usually get no name double blade razors. One of these was given to me by a friend when we were traveling and I ran out. It is the best razor i have ever used. It is smooth, shaves close, and quickly. I am really happy. Because of it, I tried a few other triple blades, but this is the best. It will usually last 7 days, the same as the double bladed ones."
5,wORKS FINE,Used these for a long time now and I think they may be even better than the more expensive razors.
5,good razors but highly dispensable.,"Unless you keep it dry, these arent very good for more than maybe 2 uses. they get very dull very fast. but for the one or two uses they are fantastic and cheap razors. a pack of eight lasts me a while"
4,flexible blades are best for me,"i love the flexible blades for shaving my legs and armpits. no knicks, ever. i tend to find that men's blades last longer than women's blades so I buy men's products. if the blade lasted longer than 2 weeks against my not heavy female leg hair I would give it 5 stars but 2 weeks with one razor is pretty good."
1,Wannabe Gilette Mach 3 :P,"If I could I would give this a NO STAR! They're good if you don't shave against the grain, but if you want a clean shave you have to shave against the grain... Sooo What's the point? Plus I was very much annoyed that when I started shaving my hairs were getting stuck in the blades and full on stuck... I couldn't even rinse them off in the water... So this just sucks! The best think about this is it uses vitamin e and aloe... but that's it!So no star!"
5,Best recording of Concord,"There are a bunch of recordings of Concord. This one captures the depth and granduer. In addition, Hamelin has the chops to really go at the work and the smarts to listen to Ives's own examples of how to play Ives."
1,Dense but not a good reference,I ordered this book several years ago based partly on the recommendations here. I'm not sure where they went. I have tried to use this book as a reference mainly for Word and Excel and found it not helpful. I know the basics but sometimes I need a little help. There's lots of dense but selective details in the book. However try looking up basic but little used tasks such as strike through and it's not there.
4,A tightly written review of what might be known of St. Peter,"While admitting that the historical record is spotty and inferential, Michael Grant develops a ""biography"" of Saint Peter that leads the reader to the conclusion that much of the tradition surrounding Peter (leader of Christ's apostles, his role in establishing the Church at Rome) may well be rooted in historical fact.Never one to stretch the evidence beyond what it can sustain, Grant is careful to present alternative theories, weigh them, and draw conclusions based on the preponderance of the historical evidence. This is a short book, but one crafted with great care."
4,Boss greets you from NJ,This is the debut album from the Boss. Blinded by the Light and Growin' Up are the two sweet tracks. Mary Queen of Arkansas is a slow one. Lost in the Flood is the harbinger of what is to come on BORN TO RUN album. For You is my favorite track. Spirit in the Night is like a jazz piece. The last track tells how it is hard to be a saint in the city.
2,Early Bruce...,"If you want to hear the original recordings to theManfred Mann songs (Spirit In The Night, andBlinded By The Light), then buy this CD.Otherwise, you'd have to be a big fan to buy this one.You'll probably listen to it and keep it on your shelffor a long time."
5,Memories,Glad to add another Bruce classic to my CD collection.Hard to believe how old this album is but sounds better than ever
3,Suspended In My Masquerade,"GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK presents the jazzy, poetic, early-version Springsteen, searching for his own sound.The problem with the first few Springsteen records, not resolved until 1975's BORN TO RUN, was an inability to recreate the band's legendary live shows on vinyl. ""Growin' Up"" is good here, it was downright riotous live, as various bootlegs and the version on the E-Street Band Live box set atest.But, despite some questionable production decisions and the inclusion of some occasionally pretentious clunkers, the early records are awash in great tunes. ""Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?"" is an amazing thing; ""For You"" a lament to a wacked lover; ""Growin' Up"" and ""It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City"" chest-puffing declarations of independence, and--well, who hasn't driven too far in the middle of the night, singing along to ""Spirit In The Night,"" the sister-piece to ""Rosalita""?"
3,His first was his weakest for years to come,"Someone put a leash on this boy! Only 23 when he released this album, Springsteen wrote lyrics that sound as if he thinks he's only going to get one shot to say everything he ever thought of. As a result, he comes up with some brilliant but meaningless songs, and the pretentiousness of the likes of ""Mary Queen of Arkansas"" outweight the exuberance of his performance on those cuts. The best songs are the ones where producer Mike Appel lets him haul in a band and play the way he knew best: Loud and energetic. ""Sprit in the Night,"" ""It's Hard to be a Saint in the City"" and ""Blinded by the Light"" are brilliant if slightly overwrought songs sabotaged by a thin production that waters down Gary Tallent's bass and jams the rhythm section into the background. For a more successful album in a similar vein, check out ""The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle."""
3,Some real gems,"can be found on this album, but there are some songs that are a bit weak (in the context of who it is). I chalk this up to Bruce being young and this was his first album. I still listen to it often. In all, I think it's pretty darn good. Look how many songs stand the test of time: Growing Up, Spirit in the Night, It's Hard to be a Saint in the City, I Came for You--these songs are still familiar after 25 years.My husband hates Bruce Springsteen, but even he can stomach most of the songs on this album. While it isn't my favorite of Bruce's, it is one of my favorite albums overall."
3,The average beginnings...,"Like he has said, this was the last time he made music without wondering if anyone would ever hear it.It shows. It's rough, but verbally virtuous. There are more lyrics on this album than on his next three combined! He can't stop.Compared to his subsequent albums, it's terrific to see his progression...but as a start, it's merely average.There are a handful of stone classics...like ""Growin' Up"" and ""It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City"", but having been exposed more to his incendiary live versions, these pale.But, in my opinion, if you get ONE Springsteen album, you should get them ALL. Like The Beatles. Even their ""weak"" albums are essential, if you know what I mean.Besides, it's fun to put on ""Blinded By The Light"" for your uninitiated friends and watch them say, ""He covered this song?""Then they wonder why you're laughing..."
5,Still rocks after all these years,"This is the album that introduced me to Springsteen. I picked it up 20 years later and was amazed at how well the work has stood up. ""Growin' Up"" is every teen rebel's theme song, ""For You"" is for that crazy one who broke your heart, ""Spirits in the Night"" is one of the finest party songs ever written and worth the price of admission by itself. If you doubt that Springsteen is a poet, try this one. If you want to see the young Boss at his best, ditto."
4,great tools for the price,"I do mostly small engine work and this set is great. I use this set a lot with no issues. I have used snap on sockets that feel a little better so I rated this set 4 stars, however, given the dramatic difference in price this set is a much better value. Buy this set and lots of other tools for the same price as a snap on set."
1,Useless Product,"I have a serious mosquito problem. After 2 wks w/scent pkg my MM captured 0 mosquitos. After removal of the scent pkg, the next four wks revealed the capture of 24 mosquitos. Adding to the cost of the machine, the propane, etc, this amounted to over $20.00 per mosquito. Totally unacceptable. This proved to me that the machine is a WASTE of money. The company's after sale service matches its product's performance. They were contacted twice by email and once by regular mail. The company did not provide me with the courtesy of a reply. My only suggestion to those considering purchasing the mosquito magnet is don't waste your money like I did."
2,Not Worth the Money,"This very short book had one good fact -- review multiplication tables twice a day. Other than that there was not much ""meat"" to this book and it could easily be (and should have been) a chapter in another book regarding effective teaching methods."
3,"Decent continuation, but doesn't strengthen the movie as much","Some of the great John Williams themes from the other Harry Potter movies can be found in this track. However, overall I felt this track didn't strengthen the movie quite as much. In particular, there's no memorable tracks for the spiders or basilisk. Every great monster should have its own musical theme, but those parts are largely silent or just retreads. I'd recommend getting one of the other Potter soundtracks, unless you're a diehard Potter fan."
5,It's about time,"This second volume of ""Essential Perry"" contains the entire contents of six classic LPs from the 50s and early 60s--So Smooth; We Get Letters; By Request; Sing to Me, Mr. C, Como Swings; and For The Young At Heart -- originals of which I had when they first appeared, but lost in a freak fire. No Como fan should be without them. When I heard they were out and available in a boxed set, I was delighted. The quality of production is great, though, of course, half of the originals are mono, having pre-dated stereo. But get 'em. Enough said."
2,"Winter Gloves, Really?","I thought I'd found the perfect outdoor winter gloves. I watched the video, read the reviews and knew I made the right buy until I wore them. My hands nearly froze. It was like, I wasn't wearing gloves at all. And the temperature was only 35 degrees with no wind. Waterproof maybe, but winter should be removed from the title and description. Don't let the video fool you. I returned them after one day of use. Winter Plus My...."
2,Youngstown Gloves,They do not keep my hands warm at all at temps under 32 degrees. Very unhappy with this product. Plus they run a little small on the size.
2,Good gloves -- but inappropriately sized,"These gloves are nice and seem like they'd keep you warm. But I returned mine -- my hands usually fit an ""XL"" glove -- but I bought the 2XL size, which seemed like it was an ""L"" in reality. UNDERSIZED! Youngstown -- why not invest an extra square inch of material and make these gloves come out the correct size?I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said the gloves are suitable for long fingers. I have long fingers. And there's about a half inch of ""webbing"" between the fingers, and the same between thumb and forefinger."
3,Nice glove with some limitations,"These are well constructed lightweight gloves and they are warm. For high level tactile use, there is a problem. The gripping pads on the palms extending to the pads at the end of the fingers are useful. The stitching around the finger tips, however, makes them useless for pressing buttons like a garage door opener or a key fob. The material is too stiff to form around the finger tip. If you need to manipulate buttons, the gloves have to come off. Aside from that, they offer a good value. They run small. Go at least one size larger."
2,Size problems,This is supposed to be XXL which should fit me nicely. The only reason I ordered them was that they were available in XXL. the problem is they are way too tight. They do not seem to be sized at XXL.
2,don't wear well,"My husband wore them once, and the lining ripped, now they are not functional. No I guess I wouldn't recommend them. My husband has big hands and thought they would be perfect."
5,Great!,Lines the entire back carpet and traps everything from mud to dirt to liquids. Very tough and keep the carpets clean.
2,one of speakers did not work properly out of the box.,"Had to send back due to one speakers inoperable right out of box. Installed and found inop, was not happy. Had to remove from vehicle, send back, and purchase new set. Bummer..."
3,Curios CD but definitely not jazz,"The reviewer below seems to have posted a review for another CD entirely. I own the Japanese version of this CD, Sidsel Endresen's ""Undertow"" and it is not a jazz CD at all. Instead it reminds me of some of Beth Orton's more ethereal work as her and Sidsel's vocals are quite similar. Perhaps the review below was generated by Amazon's AI software or perhaps just an honest mistake. As for recommending this CD, it's nice if you like somber ambient-like goth-pop, particularly Beth Orton's earlier stuff. I gave it 3 stars because it's not nearly up to Beth's standards and just wasn't so engaging to me over all."
5,astonishing,"It is probably essential that you become familiar with John Knowles Paine. I have a good music education, and had never heard of him until I happened to catch this piece on digital cable. I thought it was Brahms/Beethoven/Mahler, a mix...could not quite make it out. But you should listen to what an American wrote that is basically unknown. i think you will be surprised positively."
3,More Amazing Women's Patterns,"I bought this book because I'd heard that the patterns were outstanding. A brief perusal of the book would seem to confirm this.Gaughan's construction methods are innovative and exciting...as long as you are making her women's patterns. Almost all of the sweaters for men are drop-shoulder sweaters, which is a little disappointing. It is still a great book and worth having...just not for the men's patterns."
5,"challenging, impressive and very difficult","We knitters are fortunate to have such a wonderful book but it is very difficult and also challenging. Very few books have reached this level and the author has impressive credentials. After researching them online I discovered that most of the 35 different yarns are knitting worsted or dk which is good because I don't have them nor can buy them. Every design is explained first by math and nature although it didn't help me much. Pictures are ok but more would have been even better. No complaints on book layout, printing or schematics, although type could have been darker. Yarns are not labeled in the new number system or the old which is a problem as two are already discontinued. Make no mistake, this is a difficult book but it is also a milestone on the knitting map. Yes, it is a pattern book but more than that, it is a new way to see knitting and for those few who can understand it should lead to a new world of knitting designs."
5,Original and interesting patterns,I love this book! It is new and original and made me want to knit ones of the designs ASAP. The presentation is A+ and the photography beautiful. I have quite a knitting library and this book is one of my favorites.
4,Experience and knitting friends are important for enjoying any knitting book.,This book was sent as a gift to an experienced knitter who is a member of a Saturday knitting club. The recipient was looking for a resource book of fresh styles and ideas which could be modified and expanded upon rather than a book of basic techniques.I think that for any book about the knitting hobby requires the reader to have experience sufficient to catch any errors which may occur in its text and to modify and expand freely on designs. Membership in a knitting club is also desirable so that other knitters can help sort out problems. I'd not recommend it (or any book at this level) for someone who has less than several years of knitting or who is attempting to use it without peer support.
5,Great resource!,This is a great book to have in your collection. Norah Gaughan has some very interesting patterns and there is something for everyone.
5,"elegant, stunning work","I was so excited to receive this book in the mail this week - I gasped several times as I turned from page to page in this book. My 5 yo daughter kept coming over to me to look at what I was reacting to. Thank you Norah for these gorgeous, elegant and inspired designs - I think I want to make nearly all of them!"
4,Knitting Nature: 39 Designs Inspired by Patterns in Nature,"Very modern designs. These designs are inspiring to more experienced knitters,encouraging to new knitters. Well written book."
2,Book listed as new but book had stain,I just wanted the buyer to know that they listed the item as NEW but on one of the pages there is a stain and it a fungus stain. My only issue would be the price as it was listed as new and in a plastic wrap they provided but the book had a moisture fungus stain. If I had known I would not have bought it for that price. For a discount used price it would be worth it.
1,What a disappointment !!!,An expensive book with one or two pattern worth doing. I agree 100% with Nancy. The title has nothing to do with the patterns.
5,Fun for the advanced knitter,"Finally a book for those who know how to knit and would like a little more challenge. These have pleanty of challenge and a lot of beautiful patterns. Most, if not all wearable. Only 1 with multiple color work the rest are stitch texture. Not an odd ball book, these take planning and a trip to your yarn store to get the right materials."
5,Gaughan is the best thing going!,"I hesitated to buy this book, because of all the complaining about errors. But the fact is, Norah Gaughan is one of the freshest and most intriguing knitwear designers out there. I find myself attracted to her designs everywhere I see them - so it was worth it to me to put up with perhaps some less-than-perfect editing to get this kind of originality and inspiration."
2,Very expensive,"This memory is very expensive, i've buyed this by confusion and later buyed another one of 1gb at less price in another store. Still is a great memory"
3,beware,"This album is OK if you like jazzy, 60's, very perky lounge group-vocals like Lambert, Hendricks and Ross and the groups one used to hear on 60's TV variety shows, but it is very definately not like the Salvador of ""Chambre avec Vue."""
2,What!?,"Go to Lowe's. They have the same plant, only better condition and they guaranty them for a year."
5,Beautiful with a story that got lost in the process,"Johnny Nash does indeed do a spectacular job with ""I Can See Clealy Now"". What is little known is the genesis of the song. Johnny had a couple of regional hits, vacationed in Jamaica and heard a very, very young group of kids play and sing Mento. Or maybe already Rock Steady. Who knows. Anyway, he got to talking with the kid singing lead, and Junior sang a new song that he had written to The Big Man From America. The BMFA liked it and gave the kid fifty bucks for it. Took it back home, and had an international hit on his hands.The kid who wrote and sold it was Bob Marley."
5,Wedding Gift,The glasses were a gift and much appreciated by the recipient. They are heavy and I imagine they will last a long time.
1,"mumfie, shmumfie","I'll be honest, I haven't seen the video but I've watched endless tv episodes. The guy who does all the characters has to be the worst ever. Talk about 'The man with one voice'. The stories are lame and the characters are so cliched. The only execption, just, is the short bloke obsessed by 'ruuels'. The trouble is my 3 year old boy absolutely loves it. Then again he loves spending hours sitting by a rail track watching the trains go by. Buy it and weep"
2,Not as good as the free samples,"I got some of these as free samples in a package of now discontinued Schick razors. At first I wasn't impressed, but I warmed up to them, so I bought a couple of packs. The ones I got this time were not as comfortable, sharp, or smooth shaving as the samples. I won't buy any more.These are the full razor disposable version. Don't confuse them with the packs of replacement blade cartridges.Vendor was great by the way.Peter"
4,An interesting commentary on women's relationships with food,"This book is meaningful not only for women who have or are recovering from eating disorders, but for any woman who struggles with body image and our society's ideal of feminine beauty. (You may even want to give this book to the men in your life so they can better understand women's issues w/ food.) Food isn't the sole focus of this book--she discusses friendships, significant others, even her relationship with her cat. While Roth's writing is sincere and honest, she tends to lapse into cliched psychobabble and New Age-y talk. (I found the analogy of her cat's body image vis-a-vis her body image to be a bit of a leap.) Overall, this book is very well-written, and it stayed with me long after I read it. I recommended it to several friends, and for me that's the mark of a worthwhile read."
5,geneen roth books...,"through telling her story, she is telling you another way. a better way. not to diet! to learn to love yourself and to stop depriving and indulging. she shows you that with allowing and enjoying, you CAN find a balance. it isn't an immdiate result but, it is a lasting one for the body and... the mind."
2,Didn't do much for me.,"It's a good book, but if you. like me, are looking for some weight loss inspriation, this wasn't it for me. It might be for another,but didn't do it for me. I kept looking to see how her experiences could help me,inspire me, show me something, but it didnt. Her experiences are definitely worthwhile, but it had little or nothing to do with the actual advice I was looking for. I've heard volumes of Geneen Roth and while I'm eager to read more of her books, this one didn't do it for me."
2,A poor self indulgent essay,"I am an Overeater, I also have Candida Albicans. I was so interested when I started to read this book and hoped for more insights since Geneen Roth talks about Candida as well as her obsession with food. I am sorry but I didn't find them. I didn't find any thing particularly useful and for me, well I was looking for help and support in my relationship with food, I found it a was just a self indulgent ramble, lots of waffling. It is the first book I read of the authors and so perhaps one of her other books would be more useful to me. Sorry I just don't like ramblings."
1,Poorly made,I purchased an EC-500 carrier in 2006. The first two fell apart. The third had a caster break which Jaypro would not replace. I do not recommend carriers from Jaypro.
4,"Good, but needs a proofreader","This book is a good, tasty collection of no muss, little fuss raw recipes. The author assumes you know how to make sprouts (although a brief recipe is included) and have a working ability to substitute for hard-to-find ingredients. Most of the recipes are tasty and work well. My main gripe is that some recipes, particularly those using garbonzos, are very unclear whether you are to soak only, soak and sprout, or what. Some editing/proofreading could have solved these problems. Otherwise, try them out. The ""brown bag"" lunch ideas alone are worth the cost of this little book, and the cookies are tasty."
2,Garden of Eden AFTER the snake,"Although I want to eat healthier, having a lunch of raw corn on the cob, spinach, pickling cucumber and sprouts isn't going to do much for my McDonald's appetite. Where do you get sunflower sprouts? What is cherimoya? Dried pulse? Many of the ingredients were not available. My grocer hadn't even heard of some of them. Very disappointing book"
4,North Carolina Pottery,This book contains the most wonderful photos. I am currently taking pottery classes and love the classic lines of the older pieces of pottery
3,NIce bulb,"Purchased this over two months back. I was excited to install this in my car and finally did so along with a Load equalizer (bought it from autozone in the bulb aisle) to keep the normal blinking speed. The bulb is not as bright as i believed it to be. But for the price, its a nicer alternative. The LEDs have a long way to go to be commercially sold for a cheaper price. But for now, we are forced to settle for these regular LEDs."
5,SPIRITUAL CHILLOUT CD,THIS CD IS SO ENJOYABLE. I AM JUST THRILLED TO DEATH THAT I MADE THIS PURCHASE. MUSIC TO SOOTH THE SOUL!
5,Grat music and grat recording,"One of the best and interesting opera of Handel with exelant interpretation, production and recording.I hop ever see the same on DVD."
4,Incredible collection,Talk about bang for the buck - a very complete of Irish music by various categories and each with anecdotal remarks that give more meaning for your musical experience. A tremendous effort was put into this anthology. It'd be nice if the CDs were included but they're worth the extra $$$.
1,Mel Bay's Complete Irish Fiddle Player,"This version DOES NOT CONTAIN THE CD'S. DO NOT BE FOOLED...l. the version with the CD costs a lot more and is available here, but the one they sent me did NOT, even thought these reviews say CD'S included."
5,Great place to start,"Peter Cooper has put together an excellent introduction to the world of Irish fiddling. The book progresses through levels of difficulty, introducing the reader to the different tune forms (jigs, reels, hornpipes etc) and the different forms of ornamentation. The first few sections introduce tunes that are fun to play and not too difficult; however, this book is not for absolute beginners. You should have a sound knowledge of the fingerboard to get the most from it.One great feature of this book is that the tunes are ones you are almost sure to hear in sessions in the United States. If you learn the tunes in this book you will have a good solid set of session tunes to play for those nights you get together with friends or go to a pub."
5,best Irish instructional book out there,"I am a professional violinist and teacher (both classic and traditional Irish training) and this is my favorite book to use with students, if a book is desired (while learning by ear is the obvious method of choice that has been employed for centuries, most modern players who read music seem to feel better with a page of notes in front of them...)There are loads of books of Irish music (and I think I just might possibly own them all) but this book is the BEST instructional book of them all- the closest thing to a ""textbook"" on Irish fiddling that there is (all my students use it). I also use the Suzuki method books for my classical violin students, and yes, I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who felt Cooper's book is the Suzuki method of Irish fiddle."
3,Graphics are nice but fabric is not very comfy,The graphics on this product are good and the material seems to be holding up with the few washings I have done but the fabric the comforter is made out of is not very soft or comfy.
4,Love the Backyardigans,My granddaughter loves the backyardigans so of course when I saw this comforter I bought it for her bed. I didn't buy the sheets because of reviews the sheets are a little rough. She adores the comforter. Reviews said it was also rough but its not too bad and she won't be sleeping on the comforter. Satisfied Grandma and would reccommend this comforter.
4,Terrific Performance of Neglected Masterpiece,"In my opinion Shapero's Symphony for Classical Orchestra is possibly the greatest symphony by any American composer, with the possible exception of Copland's Third. An unjustly neglected masterpiece. Andre Previn deserves our thanks for his efforts to revive interest in the work, with performances with a number of top orchestras as well as this recording, though even his heroics don't seem to have given the work legs. As for this performance, the sound is terrific and the playing overall is probably better than the earlier Bernstein/Columbia Symphony version, but it is still surprisingly scrappy in places. Perhaps because it is a very difficult work (and still somewhat unfamiliar to the players). It would benefit from a new recording by a top-notch orchestra (or even by today's LA Phil), but this is a piece I would like every music lover to know, and this recording will certainly help you learn to love it."
5,Fabulous mints!!!!!!!,"These mints are very good, but it's not a good idea to have them shipped during the hots summer months. When I received my order, I was very disappointed to see them all melted together. The package was lined in styrofoam, and they had enclosed ice packs, but it still took 4 days to get to me. I think dry ice would have been a better choice. I would only buy them again in the fall or winter."
5,Pete Seeger his best from the Columbia years!,"The World Of Peter Seeger is a very good introduction of Pete Seeger music for the causal and non-causal fan alike. All the songs that are the most fimilair with Seeger and fans are here. CD reissued of this release contained the 1973 original double vinyl LP set complied on one disc. The World Of Pete Seeger is a collection of his best work including 'We Shall Overcome', 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone', 'Little Boxes' and 'Turn! Turn! Turn!'. The sound quality is very good however there is no extra photos or liner notes. Discographical notes are very brief giving just the dates of record released. These songs are from Seeger's 1960's tenure at the Columbia label. You should also seek out CD's from his days with the Weavers and his solo days with the folkways label. If I Had a Hammer: Songs of Hope & Struggle should also be added to your collection as well. Buy it."
2,Confusion,"I found this book to be VERY confusing. At the onset, Dr. Vines admonishes us to accept ""All"" the scripture as completely true and reliable and then later on in subsequent chapters, he tells us we can't get our doctrine from the Book of Acts. He calls this a ""rule"" and gives absolutely NO biblical substantiation for this ""rule.""I found this to be only one example of the contradictory and confusing nature of this book. I cannot recommend this book as a reliable, biblical source for the person sincerely seeking God's Word for information on spiritual gifts."
5,"The lineage of great American literature: Huckelberry Finn, The Old Man and the Sea, The Road","A dark, dismal landscape. No sun, no moon; grey days and black nights. A landscape of ash. No hope, only death and rotting corpses. The illuminating beauty of fatherly love. The redeeming power of goodness. A glimpse of the divine in man. ""The Road"" is all of these things and more. This is true art."
3,Utterly Depressing!!,"A father and son wander the roads of a post-apocalyptic America, hoping to find their way to the coast, and a better life. The landscape that they travel is barren, grey and dull, and most of the people they meet are bad.I found this book a very bleak read, very monotonous, but yet still hard to put down. This was due to the powerful bond, in the story between the father and son, who absolutely live for each other. It makes you want to read on, to see what happens to them, in the end."
3,Ok read,"Very easy read, with an interesting plot. Narrators voice can get a bit annoying, but if you can get past that, it is a very good book. Great for younger readers wanting to advance a bit. He doesn't use verbal communication between characters very often, and narration can be a bit of a burden to read, only in the way it is written. Simplistic, if you will.Reading did rub against my grain a bit, but the emotion conveyed, and how he can occasionally drew me into the plot and the characters struggles made it well worth reading.I would recommend this book. Very good bathroom or bedtime material."
5,Like no other book,"I wanted to throw this book across the room so often - yet I couldn't release my grasp or even put it down for 2 days.What would I do, my 5 year old son near starvation, who would I kill, could I end both our lives if I had no hope of anything short of a miserble tortured death? McCarthy forces the reader against these maddening questions with prose worthy of the best reporter. Hershey's Hiroshima is the only thing close. Simple spare prose, with occasionally arresting words made more remarkable by the flat relentless pace of surrounding colorless vocabulary. This book is not for everyone. Other fathers may find it too horrible to read. Even McCarthy tells us that once an image enters your head it won't leave. And you won't enjoy so many images he offers you. Yet he completely and deeply captures the primal abiding love of a father for his son. Deeper and more vital than civilization, food and shelter or even morality. What a book!"
4,Exceptionally long with repetitive sequences....,"I found ths book well written from the standpoint that you are instantly swept away into McCarthy's futuristic world. It is absolutely wonderful in the description of a world gone mad.My problem with the book is it never fully explains why they are going cross country and places that would have made sense (the abandoned fall out shelter full of food) are abandoned in this mind numbing attempt to get to a coast that is no different from the hell they have left behind.Sad & poignant, worth the read, just not a great book for me."
3,Meh...,"I have no clue why The Road won a Pulitzer Prize.I usually fly through books but I found The Road extremely slow and dry. Granted, probably a very realistic depiction of a post-apocalyptic future, yet none the less The Road is just plain bland and constantly leaves you wishing for more than two sentences of dialogue. Imagine the movie 'New World' in print."
2,Repetitious,"I bought this book based on other's reviews and because it was a Pulitzer Prize winning book. The premise sounded good, but in actuality it wasn't. The storyline of a father and young son traveling across a post apocalyptic America to ""the coast"" sounded intriquing and I was expecting more than what the author provided. It was basically the same thing over and over and over.... . It was cold, it was dark, the trees were black, gray ash covered everthing, we were hungry, the old blankets stank, run into some bad people, then repeat again, then repeat again, you get my point. I honestly do not see what made this book a ""Prize"" winner. Thumb through the pages and read one or two, then thumb to another part of the book and read another page or two, you'll see what I mean. Save yourself some time and money on this one."
2,A Disappointment,"I found this book to be redundant and lacking in substance. As other reviewers have pointed out, McCarthy's sparse prose succeeded in giving the reader plenty of freedom with which to imagine the post-apocalyptic world. But coming from the same author who penned the Border Trilogy and No Country For Old Men, I view this book as a huge dissapointment hardly worthy of the few hours it took to read (it goes very, very quickly because McCarthy indents quite liberally every couple of lines-- another reason why this book is hardly worth buying). To say the least, I expect much more out of one of my favorite contemporary fiction writers."
3,Walking the Road,"This book makes you think of what could be. It asks the question, 'what would I do in this situation?' 'Would I react the same way?' However, the book is depressing to the reader and gives virtually no hope. Also, there is not much interaction with other characters; and the story seems monotone. On the plus side, it is a quick read and different than the usual post-Apocalyptic books. I didn't put it down til I finished it; I guess looking and hoping for a positive ending to the man and boy's plight."
4,Great book....,"My husband came home with this book one day from the book store. The only reason I ended up reading it was because I had ran out of books to read. I couldn't be happier about that! This isn't a book that I would have normally chosen for myself. I also wasn't too sure about it when I started reading it, but I kept going. I'm so glad that I kept reading. This book is set in a post-apocalyptic world, so it's dark. It follows a man and his son ""on the road"". Meanwhile, they are avoiding 'the bad guys' (cannibals). This book is all about unconditional love, even in hard times. There is nothing stronger than the love between a parent and child. This is one of those books that sticks with you."
4,The Road- audio book,"originally, I purchased this book in audio form because I mistakenly believed I'd be able to load it onto my digital card in my phone for leisure listening. That didn't work. the CDs overlapped each other; there was no differentiating between any. The narrator did a good job except for the boy's voice. He made the boy sound like a major wimp, which irritated me as I listened. Lesson learned- audio books aren't for uploading yet. Perhaps this is how we'll all end up buying kindles and like products. Other lesson learned, there's no narrator as good as one's own imagination. I will buy the book from now on.I was enthralled with the story despite it's depressive nature. I look forward to eventually seeing it on screen."
3,"World Ends, Bad Things Happen","I read McCarthy's Border Trilogy, and at the end, I concluded that the whole thing could be summarized as follows ""Boys go to Mexico by themselves. Bad things happen."" You can summarize The Road by varying the formula only slightly: ""The world ends. Bad things happen.""The major difference is that the Border Trilogy is set in a world where good things might possibly happen (albeit never to the stories' protagonists), and The Road is set in the world where nothing good can ever possibly happen to anybody (unless you count finding enough food to keep you going through Hell a good thing). For those of you who find a ray of hope in the ending, I can only ask--what are you smoking, and where can I get some?While the writing is fairly good, as with the rest of McCarthy's work, the subject matter is as depressing as ever. If you like reading about one bad thing happening after another, McCarthy is your guy."
5,The Dark Future of Mankind,"Wow! What a powerful story this book tells. This is the story of post-apocolyptic America with the main characters, a man and his son, trying to survive in a rather bleak existence. They run into all sorts of challenges and see things that challenge their very question of existence. The tale constantly makes you ask yourself, ""What would I do?""McCarthy's imagery is so astonishing, you can actually see the landscape as he describes it in the book. The writing is of course, beautifully written, and the book itself is a page-turner as you will want to see what happens next with the man and his son and how they manage to survive from day to day.I would highly recommend this book for some thought-provoking reading."
2,did I choose the wrong Cormac to start? I think so,"This was my first experience with Cormac McCarthy, did I choose the wrong book? I hope so as I also ordered Sutree and the Border trilogy. Prey they are better than this borefest. It's a long time since I have read a book and been able to skip pages at a time and not miss a beat. I was looking for some meaning, some hidden messages in the sparse conversations of the Man and the Boy, mostly drivel, eventually gleaning that the innocence of the boy is the key vs the trained mistrust of all things by the Man. Sound message but not ground breaking by any means.Really this is not worth your precious time when there are so many great reads out there. Maybe the movie is better but my motivation after this turgid tale is pretty low"
2,Overcooked and not very tasty...,"This book is science fiction so I shouldn't be too hard on it but the premise is weak. I love a good post-apocalyptic story but this wasn't very satisfying. The world has been dead for at least 4 or 5 years but yet there are still people wandering around it occasionally eating each other. A nameless father and son team survives day to day by somehow finding food in places where they are always found by others (so why didn't the others find the food first?). The man tries to convince himself that they are the good guys, but in the end, while not cold blooded murders, they are strictly out for themselves. The extremes are too obvious, the setting too unrealistic and unexplained, and finally the ending too inconsistent with everything else in the book.Luckily this book is a very quick read and I'm glad I didn't spend the money to rush out and see the movie."
4,The Road,Very well written. One of the best dystopian novels I've read. Quite depressing. Engrossing but not a beach read. The end
4,Good book if you like being depressed.,I found this book extremely depressing. Realistic I guess but after reading it I wish I hadn't. No hope ..
4,Not For Everyone,This is not a beach book or a chick lit book. You need to really use your brain on this one. It's an interesting book about a dad and son going across a land after a major attack with nothing out there and how they survive. I describe this as a thinking person book. It goes quick.
5,Even better in audio!!,"Do you want to experience a bleak post-apocalyptic world? Listen to Rupert Degas's reading of Cormac McCarthy's The Road. McCarthy won a Pulitzer Prize with this novel describing the passage of father and son down an endless road in a wiped-out environment, scavenging for food to survive where they can. I read the novel first so I knew the story, but couldn't tear myself away from this audio. Degas (in totally different voice to his readings of another contemporary `great', the novels of Haruki Murakami) doesn't get emotionally embroiled...just reads it like it is. As listeners, we can only observe, frightened, hopeful, concerned, occasionally tearful, as father/son stagger on to an ending you know is coming in one way or another. McCarthy's language, spare and powerful, hits home like poetry. Required listening for politicians playing nuclear power games."
3,What is all the hype about?,What is all the hype about? I expected something more when reading this book. I thought it was haunting in some respects yet left a lot of questions to be answered. Could have used more story line and less repetitiveness.
2,Fast read,The imagery in his writing is good but I kept waiting for something...ANYthing...to happen in this book and it doesn't.
5,For fathers,"If you're a father and love your son, you will love this book. A father's love- others have tried to pen it; McCarthy succeeds. Like with any masterpiece of Art, one can analyze and analyze but in the end can't explain why it works. The Road does."
2,Why the hype?,I cannot see why this book has been well reviewed. It is not that interesting. The plot is thin. There is little character development and leaves many questions unanswered. A small example is when the boy (who was born after the disaster when everything shut down) sees an immobile train he makes train sounds. He would never have heard them.I am sorry I bought the book. I never saw the movie but it must have been deadly boring unless they added to the story.
3,the road,"It was more affordable here than at the bookstore. Plus you can always sell it back for money. The story line was okay, but if you like this book i recommend watching the movie THe Postman with Kevin Coaster(awesome)!"
4,The Road walked Again,This is a good read that is somewhat obvious in places. It keeps the interest fed but each outcome of an incident is easily anticipated so that there are no surprises. Worth reading if only to show the weakness of human emotions.
5,A stunner!,"You're tired of apocalypic literature. Then you pick up this book. Reviewers say you won't find comfort here, but they're wrong. It's a painful nightmare in so many places, but this book is ultimately about miracles. I'm reminded that the road has forks, and that the choice between love and evil is always an option."
4,Either or,Half full or half empty. Enlightening or depressing. despair or hope. Arguments could abound. It depends on what you want to see. Amazing.
4,"A riveting, bleak novel","This was a great story. It represents good over evil, endurance over hopelessness, and courage over cowardice. Set in a post apocalyptic time, a man and his son try to survive in a world of ash and destruction, death and depravity. If you are looking for a happy novel, this is not the one you want. It is bleak and (in some parts) disturbing. It's also a good story. I would recommend this novel to anyone."
5,not the happiest but...,"I originally bought this book for my mother for Christmas. Two weeks later she returned the book to me and told me that she didn't enjoy it because it was too depressing and left her ""with a saddened, dark, and empty feeling."" I then read the book and I can say it is easily my favorite book of the 21st century. It tells the story of a young boy and his father forced to face everyday life in a world that has ended. The things they are forced to do in order to survive may disturb some but the overall tale of the undying love and loyalty between a father and a son is classic however McCarthy does change things with the setting and trials they face. I recommend this book to anyone not afraid of a darker story between father and son."
5,An unusual love story,"A bittersweet love story about a father and son. Despite harrowing circumstances, the father strives to teach his son valuable lessons that will serve both him and humanity for all time. Details provided are sparse which leaves much for your imagination to work out. No two readers will come away with the same conclusions."
5,Simply the best,"You have to realize how absolutely superlative this book is.McCarthy has created his own literary rules, stripped the language, taken away the paragraphs, the chapters, the commas, the apostrophes, even many of the verbs, and left ... simply ... words. He names no one, not even the main characters--they're simply ""the man"" and ""the boy.""McCarthy may be one of the few writers in modern America who can get away with this and succeed. His writing slows you down. To read it you can't hurry. You'll miss its depth.The Road is not a pretty story. It will leave images in your head for days. But it's so well worth reading.When all is desolate in the world, you still have love, and that love reflects the spirit of God. That's what this book is about."
3,the road,book arrived in a timely manner in excellent conditionI have not read it as it was a gift for my husband - he isenjoying it!
3,Stupid scenario,"no fish, no animals but man Lives?what garbage !yes the writing conveys the feelings he wanted to get acrossbut it becomes allegoryno relation to what would be if MAD did not work."
2,save yourself some time on this one,"This is by far the grayest, darkest, gloomiest book I have ever read. Its a short read, otherwise I don't think I would have finished it. I kept hoping it would lighten up, get some color into it-- and it does, at the end with a hint of hope. I can't amagine a movie from this-- maybe a movie would save it for me?"
2,This won the Pulizer?,"I found this book dull, dull, dull. I kept reading, hoping that something would happen besides tinned food, fires and blankets. It was even more boring than ""A Country For Old Men."" What ever happened to the Cormac McCarthy of ""All The Pretty Horses"" and ""Blood Meridian""? Those were stories. I can't believe this won the Pulitzer Prize. Shame on you, Pulitzer committee, for awarding the prize to a book simply because the writer has something against apostrophes."
3,padded sentimental dystopian finger exercise,"McCarthy's post-apocalyptic vision doesn't depress me; his overenthusiastic readers do. I respect the author of Blood Meridian and Suttree too much not to demand something more and better from him than this padded sentimental dystopian finger exercise. True, even great authors nod, occasionally. But while McCarthy took this little snooze his mesmerized fans fell into a deep coma.By Cunning & Craft: Sound Advice and Practical Wisdom for Fiction Writers"
1,The Wrong Road,"I think Cormac McCarthy is one of the best writers, now, and for all time. He has talent and orginality. His language and metaphors are extraordinary. But he did not use them in The Road. The book is boring and unoriginal. So many exchanges between the son complaining and the father responding. Mad Max does it much better."
1,The Road,Very sad and not a all something you would want to remember. I would hope for a happy ending but war never really has a happy ending
5,Definately A Must Read,"""The Road"" was a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. It was full of tragedy, triumph, the love of father and son, respect, desparation and the search for a new beginning. Can't wait to see it on film."
4,one of the best so far,in this genre (post apocalipse). The end is just beautiful. I'd recommend it to any one who has the heart and stomach for a sometimes very dark book.
3,The Dark Side,"Part Carson's ""Silent Spring"", part Cohen's ""The Future"", a touch of Cohen's ""Songs of Love and Hate; but mostly Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness""; this book isn't for everyone. In fact, it may not be for most. If you read for pleasure or for escapism, this is not for you. However, if you read to be challenged, you may like it. Did I enjoy the book? No. Could I stop reading it? No. There is something about McCarthy's prose that is like listening to a beautiful song in a language you don't understand. The notes (words) are so beautiful that understanding becomes unimportant. Is this an important book? Yes. Like the depressing examples above, they open the dark side of ourselves to our examination.McCarthy is a great writer. I just prefer ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""All the Pretty Horses"" so much more."
2,Am I missing something?,"This is hyped as a masterpiece yet I don't see why. Is it the writing style? There is no plot, no climax. Only character development (and rather surface at best) as we enter the lives of a father and son on the road after an apocolyptic event (which is never explained), follow them for a few months, then end as the father dies and the son goes to live with the only ""good people"" they encounter.Pass."
2,Disappointing,"I heard from a friend whose opinion I respected that this book and others by Cormac McCarthy were a good read. I was very disappointed in The Road. It was a depressing, rambling account of the apocalypse. It was lacking in punctuation and dialogue worth reading. Now I'm trudging though his Trilogy, not as depressing but still a chore to read."
1,"A SLOW READ-NOT VERY INTERESTING, LOVED THE TOPIC","THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED OF A NATIONAL BEST SELLER. I HAVE A 100 PAGE RULE. IF A BOOK CAN'T HOLD MY INTEREST IN THE FIRST 100 PAGES, I PUT THE BOOK DOWN. THIS STORY WAS A TEDIOUS READ TO PAGE 100.... THEN I STOPPED.A MUCH BETTER READ IS ""PATRIOTS"", 'SURVIVING THE COMING COLLAPSE', by JAMES WESLEY, RAWLES. A PAGE BURNER."
1,Okay? Okay.,Don't waste your money. I typed the whole book in the title for you. What a waste of paper!
2,An author looking for accolades,If you like books that are very artsy but lacking substance then this is for you. The Prose is way over the top in trying to be sophisticated. Ultimately it fails as no relationship is ever created with the characters. Bleak scene after bleak scene very dull with little action. Save your money - try No Country for Old men - hard to believe it is the same writer!
1,horrific descriptions haunt me,"This book is very well written, you can fly through it. The problem is that you may not want to. I am not a shrinking violet, but I had to put this book down half way through. I continue to be haunted by barbaric images, so coldly and callously delivered to the reader. I made it about 20 pages past the first cellar scene. The post-apocalyptic world may indeed be exactly as he describes, and like another reviewer I hope I would be among the lucky dead if that happens. But keeping these negative images in my head makes me feel as if I am contributing to this eventual outcome. McCarthy celebrates the most vile and inhumane traits of people. No thanks!"
3,Huckleberry Finn this aint...,"I think this book is over rated. While good, I found it contrived and not much really happens. The character of the boy is not well written, seems barely there really, and the dialog between the boy and the man is forced. Seems like every dialog ends with ""Okay, Okay."" The premise is very interesting and the writing style is concise and clear. This reads like a short story, however, the ending is predictable from a mile down the road..."
4,"Good, but not great","This book was good, but not as good as I expected. Maybe I was expecting too much. The author's writing style was different, almost like reading prose poetry at times. It's basically a story of survival after some massive devastation on Earth(we never learn what happened). The two main characters, the father & son, are a little underdeveloped(at least I thought so). We never learn much of their history, or why they're headed the direction their headed. Most of the story is based around their day to day struggles for the basic necessities and the brief glimpses they have of other survivors that have become savage cannibals. All in all, good, but not great. Read it if you have some extra time."
5,"Buy it, Read it, Love it, Share it!","I was, at first, a little sceptical about this book, as I had never heard of the author before. Being a post-apoc nut, I picked it up. Im glad I did. I put it down only once, simply because my children had to eat. Its filled with emotion, mystery, horror beyond comprehension and, my favorite part, the all-or-nothing survivalist team of a father and his son. McCarthy's genius writing left out everything that a reader might consider to be important, like names. Its only after the tear-jerking end that one realizes what really is important... that a father will do everything in this world to ensure the survival of his son, and vice versa.The Road is one of my top 3 favorite books, as judged by how often I put it down. Its up there with Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"" and Moore's ""Lamb""."
2,"Tedious, repetitive, overwritten and dull","All right, Cormac McCarthy is a fine writer, but I don't understand the hoopla for this book which goes on and on with very little difference from page to page. ""Papa are we going to die,"" the boy asks. ""No son."" ""Would you tell me if we were."" ""No son."" Repetitive descriptions of a burnt out landscape, ashes everywhere, charred and dessicated people, and the book really goes nowhere. I was very disappointed."
1,I guess I missed it.,"Nothing happens. At every opportunity nothing happens. Too bad. Other than that it was not a bad read. Bleak will be well described for you from every angle. But doggone it when the occasion arrises for some plot to develop it doesn't. Couldn't they have had some interaction with any number of persons they came across. The espied little boy? The torture chamber operators? I would love to tell you what a great literary achivement The Road is, and it may well be, but to me it was little more than uneventful. Being a baby boomer this is not an unfamiliar story line. We've been exposed to any number of end of the world type tales, books, movies etc. I was looking forward to a fresh perspective and that just didn't surface. Some of my fellow amateur critics have suggested Mccarthy's works to be Hemmingwayesque. Perhaps. Not a lot going on with the 'lost generation' either. I gave it three stars for it's potential as a short story. Not the 'one star' that the scale shows."
1,Worst book I ever read,"Judging from all the reviews you will either love this book or hate it. I'm not sure why I even finished the book, terrible (unusual) writing style and very depressing, but it will certainly generate some type of emotion. I kept reading, hoping to get some answers, instead I finished feeling like I wasted my time. If you are looking for something feel-good or lighthearted, keep on looking."
3,Depressing & disturbing,"Although very well written with strong characters, the story was so disturbing and so depressing that I only kept slogging through in hopes that something good would finally happen. It never did, it only got worse."
2,Interesting but dark,"Interesting writing - just not what I expected - had never read this author before. It was a dark, somewhat depressing account of the journey of a father and son. If you're looking for something uplifting and inspirational, this book isn't the one."
1,Most Overrated Book,"Here's an excerpt from page 88 of the paperback:What are we going to do?We're going to drink some water. Then we're going to keep going down the road.Okay.That's it. Keep going down the road. You don't have to read any more. This is a ""The Road Warrior"" rip-off which is not one tenth as entertaining as the movie was. And it won the Pulitzer? Who is giving out those awards? Very dull book.By the way, I didn't fail to put in quotation marks in my excerpt from the book. The author apparently doesn't use them. In fact, half of the rules of punctuation are ignored in this book. Very artsy, isn't he? Very modern. He dont need no stinkin punctuation!Easily, the most over hyped, overrated book of the decade. This is a second rate book taken much too seriously by critics, for some reason.Reading it is a waste of time."
1,"Dull story, very bad writing","I bought this book on the advice of a friend who said it was so good that he couldn't put it down. I was bored out of my mind within just a few pages but finished the book to see if anything good would happen. The writing is simple with short, clipped sentences that wouldn't get a passing grade in a junior high school class. The story never really goes anywhere and the characters are never developed well. The whole story is post nuclear holocaust and basically about a guy and his son who travel along a road toward the coast (why??) and nearly starve, find some food, nearly starve, find some food, nearly starve, find some food, and then the father dies in the end. WTF?? I can't believe I wasted time reading this."
5,suicide or survive?,"Reading about being one of the last people alive in a dying world begs the question asked early in the book: survive or suicide? The book doesn't answer the question for you, but you'll know where you stand by the end. This post-apocalyptic book is unique that it doesn't focus on what caused the catastrophe (never mentioned) or on how to rebuild the society as a Stephen King book would. McCarthy offers no hope. It is clear that we have entered the story years after the cataclysmic event and that the world is ending and the few remaining humans are left hanging on. The book is about a father raising a son in a dying world for no reason other than that they are still alive ""for now"". The father tries to protect his son from some of the worst horrors and imparts him with the knowledge that there are limits to how far they are willing to go to survive. You will not sleep for days when you read this. It is not for the light of heart."
3,Aesthetically Suitable,"The way the author wrote the book was ""aesthetically suitable"". What I mean by this is that he was able to convey the mood of the book by passively, repetitively, and depressingly describe the grim wasted environment where nobody would obviously seem too happy about. The relationship between the father and his son must have seem complex due to the post-apocalyptic circumstances but the author portrayed this relationship as very simple yet genuine. While the author conveyed the post-apocalyptic circumstances, in third-person narration, in a suitable aesthetic mood (as I described above) it was at the same time predictable and uninteresting. The recurring description and mentioning of ashes and dying twig trees makes the book not just depressing to read but sometimes a bit colorless. Despite this I was able to enjoy this book since the relation between the father and his son was interesting enough."
4,Dark and moving,"Wow. The moment I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, not necessarily always in a good way. Sometime it was like when you see a catastrophe on the news and can't pull yourself away. The Road is a simple, but moving story of a man and son living in a grey, post-apocalyptic world just trying to survive. The book was dark, suspenseful, frightening, and heart-wrenching. McCarthy writes it in such a simple but poetic prose; you can't help but be drawn into this dark and horrific world. But even in through it all, a father's love for his son cannot be altered."
1,Say What?,"It took me a good 50 pages to figure out this story was not about two homeless people. This book is unequivocally bad, for reasons that have been well explained by other reviewers. It would be futile to once again point out the lack of punctuation and lifeless dialogue that make The Road an atrocious read, and I would find other things to criticize but those are the only features I really remember. It is a very bad sign indeed when all of the 1 star reviews of the book start to resemble the repetitive and monotonous work itself."
1,"Lack of punctuation makes you illiterate, not genius","Why oh why have so many people praised this book? I think it's because they haven't actually bothered to read it. It is boring, without plot, character development, or even literary style. I won't be reading anymore of McCarthy's books. One was one too many."
2,No quotation marks and kind of boring.,I never realized how irritating it would be to read a book without quotation marks. Why not use proper sentence structure? Plus the story was boring. They were hungry and cold and hungry over and over with very little action. Plus the dialogue between papa and son was irritating.
4,"A good book, not incredible","This book was a fast read. There is a lot of white space on the pages that make the book seem bigger than it is. Not that that's relevant to the story itself, but it's worth noting.I thought the author did a good job of keeping the focus on the main characters. However, that relentless focus often left me wondering, ""what is going on here? What is the bigger picture?"" The story and the world it took place in seemed as if it had more potential than was ultimately revealed.Overall, it was a decent book. I wouldn't say it is ""profound"" or ""genius"" but as books go, it was better than most and not as good as some."
3,"Good story, bad writing style","I enjoyed the story. It's very thought provoking, touching, and scary all at the same time. What I didn't like was the writing style. It took me a good while to get used to the sentence fragments and the conversations that weren't in quotation marks. Sometimes I had to reread parts to figure out just who was talking and when. That got old fast."
1,Not so good,I simply fund this book boring. It had absolutely no character development. The two main characters are never even given a name. They are just called boy and man. The book just darkly travels down a post apocalyptic highway to nowhere. There is little to no interest as they travel. I would not recommend this book.
1,"Repetitive, bleak, repetitive, bleak, repetitive, bleak......","As an adult who is an avid reader, I must say, I hated this book. I understood it (before you all jump down my throat). I thought it was pretentious. It was the biggest example of The Emperor's [not-so] New Apocalyptic Clothes. A root canal is a better experience. Lick an ash tray while watching your father succumb to illness and grief and you'll have gotten the full effect."
3,End Times Glimpse,"I have always thought that the rapture will happen just before a nuclear explosion of gigantic proportions (the fire next time). When I began to read The Road, it was as if my thoughts were confirmed. Life on earth for those left behind will be almost unliveable at first and this book told the story quite well. There's always hope and the ending proves this. I just felt the book was another one of the end-times stories and was disappointed reading the same story over again."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I couldnt get past page 15....but I love books, I read all the time and Oprah said she loved it, others did too. So what's a girl to do ? I FINALLY picked it up again (when I had no other book avail at the time) and continued on from page 15 (no need to re-read, the first time was agony enough). And guess what. It doesnt get ANY better! I have no idea what you guys find redeemable in this book. The language, sentance structure and choice of words make it like slogging through a thick, stinky, smelly swamp. The author gives no backstory, no history, and no future....it would not have been hard to add the rest that was lacking. I know it's hard not to at least try to stay with and finish a book, but this one don't bother - there are way better books out there!"
1,The Road,"What a depressing book! I kept waiting for the story to get better, however, it didn't. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Post - apocolyptic books....,"....are my favorite.But this one was so boring , I could'nt finish it ( which is a rarity for me.)Yes it's well written,but nothing really happens, so therefore its pointless."
2,What the heck happened?,"All through this book I kept wondering, what the heck happened? And we are never told!Virtually all life is dead. Plants, animals, people. All apparently burned up because there's ash everywhere.For this father and son, they wander along the road, trying to survive finding food none of the other survivors ever found before, and staying away from them. Was it some natural phenomena? Was it nuclear war? Why then no worry about radiation? Plus everything wouldn't have burned in up in a nuke war. Furthermore, ash would have eventually been washed away by rain into the oceans and lakes, yet they constantly deal with ash. Certainly it rained a lot on them in this novel.I freaking love post-apocalyptic fiction, yet this book was a real let down. Most of it was just repetitive drudgery. Wander, find food, shelter, stay away from other survivors, repeat over and over again."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This must have been a slow year for Pulitzer submissions if this book won the prize. The book is a slow moving rip-off of S.M. Stirling's ""Dies The Fire"" series (minus the plot, character development, dialog and punctuation).The ""story"" (and I use the term loosley) follows an unnamed man and his son down a road. We know nothing about the man or the boy, not even their names. We know that the boy is hungry because he tells the man ""I'm hungry"" - - we know the man also knows because he tells the boy ""I know"". And there you have it, the book in a nutshell.Don't be tempted by the reviews, this book is just bad. Post-Apocalypse books are not new, however since this particular book was marketed to the mainstream reader, it gained notoriety. The genre has so much more to offer, read Swan Song or the Stand or Dies the Fire. Don't read this."
1,Wanted to Slit my Wrists,This was the most depressing book I think I have ever read. I absolutely hated it. I just couldn't connect with the characters and the ending threw me right over the edge.
2,Time you never get back,"Well written but depressing, dark and claustrophobic. This book leaves you with no hope except to be close to ground zero when it happens."
5,Fiction as real as The Road is very rare today.,"As a huge fan of Cormac McCarthy, I was delighted by the warmth and tendernous of a post apocolyptic journey. An oxymoron as a novel? The fathers love for his naive innocent child, who's fear is only surpassed by his devotion to his father, stands as a sheild to protect them against the horrors of the road. I liked it, a lot!"
3,Post-apocalyptic,This is a stripped down novel with the most basic human-cum-subhuman instincts trudging through burned out landscapes and bodies looking for what was once a tomorrow. A very challenging novel and a tough read (I felt crushed and hunted). I enjoyed the trilogy better. I read the library's copy.
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"The Road is written with the rhetorical power we have come to expect of Cormac McCarthy -- dark imagery in crafted sentences. However, the story relies too heavily on an ill-conceived trip (how many McCarthy novels do that?). The cause of the disaster is left to our assumptions. The condition of the territory is in some senses too ruined, but there are regular fortuitous situations that sustain our pilgrims.The ending is contrived."
5,"By far, my favorite read in quite awhile....",A story of love and hope and the relationship between an unnamed father and his son in the most challenging of all settings---post nuclear war America.
4,"Dark, depressing, and awesome","Some people may not like the style, since it's VERY spare. The main characters never get named, and the prose is very detached and austere. However, that totally fits the lonely, empty greyness of the post-apocalyptic setting. I found myself crying more than once, but it's not overly sentimental or obviously maudlin."
3,Depressing.. unless,"This book was really depressing. I bought it for a class ""Reading Fiction"" and the discussions we had on it were interesting but I just don't like apocalyptic stuff much."
5,Absent is the Safe Haven of a Chapter Break,"Absent of predetermined breaking points, I read 'The Road' in a single sitting. Afterwards, reflecting on the tone and intent of the story, it is clear to me that this was McCarthy's intent. The safe haven of chapter breaks completely absent, McCarthy shoves the reader into an exhaustive and emotional landslide of events. Never have I been this engrossed in a world and its characters, and my immersion in the story amplified the emotional weight of a father's drive to keep his son alive in an already dead world.This book, and its author provide a beacon for the current and next generation of great American authors."
2,Terribly Boring Literature,"This book was one of the least interesting stories I've ever heard / read, which is surprising given the rave reviews and even film adoption. The story line had such potential as well given the post apocalyptic genre at hand.In one sense, the story and manner of which it was written accurately portrays how terrible and boring life is for the characters in the story so I guess that's something?Moral of the story, NOT an entertaining read by any means."
5,Depressing but a very good read,"I loved this book! It was very bleak and depressing, but it still had me very interested in the characters. I loved the fact that what exactly happened to the world is a mystery, and how we get little snippets from the past, but essentially they don't matter. This is the story of a father and son and their will to survive. I read this book in 3 days because I just couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read,"
5,Eloquent Death,"Cormac McCarthy has taken what should be one of the worst possible scenarios for any human to live through yet showed how love, strength, determination and hope drive us.His use of verbiage brings you into the story so much that it was very difficult to put the book down.A real treat for someone who thinks they have read everything."
4,Loved It!,One of the most moving books I have read in a LONG time. Unsentimental and yet it looks at the very nature of love and what it causes us to do. Makes you think about what YOU would do in the same circumstances. Would you turn cannibal if there was little to no food left? Would you abandon your child in order to save yourself? How far would you go to protect someone you loved? But McCarthy asks these questions without being heavy-handed or didactic (despite what one reviewer claimed).I was a blubbering mess by the end of the book it was that touching.Very highly recommended!
5,Could not put this one down,"Cormac McCarthy's writings are fast becoming one of my favorites. His ear for language and his ability to create an image in the reader's mind is without equal. This particular book is a novel of the future, post nuclear war, told through the lives of a father and son. It is bleak, haunting, and hard to put down.This is clearly one of my favorite books by this author. Like ""No Country for Old Men"" this book is a departure from his western series but represents a demonstration of his constantly evolving talent."
5,The Rough Side,"Cormac McCarthy is a master at portraying the ""dark side"" of life in the most descriptive way of any writer I have ever read. He does not disappoint here. After reading the book I took a good hot shower. I reccommend this to all Cormac fans.W. Barker ""Bill"" BarkerSummerville GA"
1,If you like to be depressed this book is for you...,"I got this book because it was recommended on a survivorlist blog that I follow. The author does a great job of describing the doom and gloom which is the setting for this book. However, after several hundred pages of it, it got rather boring. I still have a hard time understanding why this book is so highly recommended. I have read many books this summer and so far this is the only one that I really struggled to complete. I guess it just wasn't the kind of book for me."
3,The Road,"Very disappointed in the story .When I read that Stephen King was spookied, I though yeah, this is what I am looking for.The story was the same story you have read or seen in all of the end of times type stories. Packs of wild people looking for food,killing and robbing everyone. After a few days of thinking about what I read, sleepless nights started about if I could do what the hero thought about with his kid.So it did not spook me but made me think what would be best for my kids if the end of time every came about. Still think about it to this day."
1,Dull,I had to read this for my highschool english class and it was extremely boring. I'm writing an essay on it right now and it makes me realize even more how bad this books is..
5,Must Read,This book is a must read. The writing and imagery it creates is phenomenal. It is a simple story with a tremendous impact. I loved it. A real tear jerker at times.
4,It was a good read,"This book is interesting. It is set after a catastrophic war ravaged the earth. The author has an interesting writing style that took several chapters to get used to.Overall, I enjoyed the book and thought that it moved along rather fast.If you like adventure books, you will enjoy this book."
3,Spare and Dialogue-Driven,"And so is Shakespeare, but he was the master of tension dialogue. A better example of this end-of-the-world genre is Stewart's ""Earth Abides."" I assume the critics were on auto-gush when they reviewed ""The Road""--likely hoping for another ""Blood Meridian"" which remains Cormac Mccarthy's most revered and five-star epic. By Paul D. Cohn, Author ""Sao Tome."""
1,McCarthy has hit the wall...,"A tedious and dreary book. Only star-struck fans of McCarthy could praise this effort. Sentence fragments and the discarding of punctuation can't make this a clever book. If repetition, puerile sappy dialogue, and cliche apocalyptic images interest you, then have a go. Clipped one-line sentences spread out over 241 pages at least make the read go quickly. Skip twenty or thirty pages and it won't matter; you don't need to keep up with (or enjoy) a meaningful pattern of events or thought. Even admiring fans must face the conclusion that this effort is the definition of ""potboiler."" Cormac, don't do this again."
5,Brilliant and moving,"There's no originality in saying there's a lyric power to this story. Its dark beauty is entirely born of its chilling evocation of an apocalyptic landscape, in which humanity is reduced to a doomed scrabble for daily survival. So in some ways, it's a difficult book to read. It's one you read with a knot in your chest and put aside almost gratefully. But it's so much more than a depressing glance into a possible future. McCarthy's sparse prose is trimmed down to bare bones, in a reflection of the story land itself. It almost reads like a short story, so focused is it and so vivid its single effect. Brilliant and moving storytelling, no question about it."
2,Highly overrated author,"I bought this on a professor's recommendation because I like apocalyptic fiction. The story and concept has great potential, but fails in execution because of McCarthy's style. Even without reading the text (I understand he doesn't use quotations, among other proper punctuation), his writing style clearly felt simplistic and stilted. There were sections (mostly settings) that I thought well painted, but the dialogue was weak and often unbelievable. The narrator's 'child' voice didn't help much, but was a minor point.tl;dr: The poor dialogue and staccato sentence structure doomed what would otherwise be a very powerful story."
3,Stream of Consciousness,"The book overall was extremely well written; however, it was not my style of literature as it had no concrete resolution. It definitely is a thought provoking book that leads the reader to consider a life in which there is absolutely nothing left of a former life outside of memories and survival."
1,Post Apocolyptic Grapes of Wrath,"The Road is descriptive. The problem is it describes the same scene over and over again, in such pain staking detail that the impression is burned in your brain. The book reminds me of The Grapes of Wrath, but with less point and more dirt and dust. I highly recommend passing on this one. If your looking for post apocalyptic fiction, I recommend either Alas, Babylon, or Swan Song instead."
4,Depressing,"I give this book a four out of five because I personally did not like it. It deserves a five out of five because it evoked emotion, made me think about relationships, and mostly because I am still thinking about it two months after reading it. I really didn't like it because it left me depressed for days. It was a quick read because I didn't put it down after I started it--I had to know what happened to the characters. I have shared it with a few stable friends who can handle the dark side of humanity but I will not share it with many others. I know that humankind is depraved and that there are few who would sacrifice for others but I don't like to be reminded of it. This will provoke you to think."
5,a number one find,"Purposefully MadeWhat a wonderful soul inspiring book. It keeps you turning the pages. The book, Purposefully Made by I. Fountaine Allen is also a must read."
3,The MOST Depressing book ever,"Cormac McCarthy's vision of post apocolyptic America is so grim it makes ""On the Beach"" look cheerful. While some mildly compassionate moments exist in the story, the over-all feeling is totally desperate.I also find McCarthy's refusal to use commas or apostrophes both distracting from the story and annoying."
1,what is the message???,"I dont know why so many people liked this book. The author left much to the imagination (names of characters, what happened to the world that left the boy and man in this desperate situation. There is very litte dialogue and while we understood that the father had intense love for his son, the author left it to our imagination to find out if there were any other motives which seem evident (ie guilt?).There wasn't enough dialogue, which hindered the development of the characters.There are only so many paragraphs I could read that described the conditions around them, much of which had nothing to do with the story. I started to say to myself ""OK...I get it already....the world is desolate"", now move on and develop the story. I do not know why there are so many popular reviews. I'm fine with a depressing story, if I care about the characters, but in ""The Road"" I couldn't care less."
2,Stretching On Forever,"Another post-apocalyptic novel. This one is less fact and more fiction. I had a hard time believing the action of the two main characters, who seem to be pretending they are on vacation in a foreign land rather than traversing through a dead society.The road is literally that- a road, an abandoned highway that leads from the city to the coast. After some major nuclear catastrophe, a man and his young son take to the road in attempt to find a better place to survive than the ruined city.There are several very horrific and gory scenes portrayed within this book, including murder, infanticide, and cannibalism. Not recommended for younger audiences."
4,"Beautifully written, If you can the pretentiousness","The Road by Cormac McCarthy is truly a beautiful book. The love between father and son is palpable, and McCarthy is a master at capturing this emotion with as few words as possible. The incredibly bleak picture he paints -- a post-apocalyptic world plagued with flesh-eating humanoids -- is truly horrifying and strangely compelling. Everything is gray, gray, gray. On the whole, the book is a wonderful work. My only beef with McCarthy is his ridiculous stylistic pretentiousness. Not using punctuation or capitals is just ridiculous. It's about as cool as that freaky kid at your high school who walked around with a black trench-coat. In other words, not cool at all. Conforming non-conformists need to grow up. McCarthy writes so well, he doesn't need that lame crutch... Anyway, the book is amazing."
3,The Road to desperation,"If you're a ""cup half full"" kind of reader, you'll enjoy this book....a slow walking tour from devastation to despair. Apocalypse is here, and the countryside is bereft of all life. The few survivors turn to marauding gangs or reclusive hideaways in search of survival. The main characters, a dying Dad and his young son slog down a snowy road in search of redemption, barely surviving from one depressing chapter to another...a story of uplifting misery and hopelessness."
3,The Road - Cormac McCarthy,"I think this book is over rated - it was an easy read, sometimes interesting, but anti climatic."
3,Sad,"I read this book in a day and found it very depressing. I have two young children & I kept wondering what I would do in the same situation. It's hard to imagine keeping the faith for years upon years with little to no hope. I thought it was well written, but was hoping for a blade of grass or a bird soaring overhead at the end of the book; Anything to suggest some new growth or ray of hope for this young boy."
4,"Very depressing, but worth a read.","This book provides good discussion for a book club meeting,and it is a fast read."
3,A very good book.,"I finished reading The Road in one day. It is an enjoyable book. My only complaints are that I did not like the ending, and I did not the style of writing. The ending seemed abrupt, but it did not come out of nowhere. In part, a certain facet of it had been building up, and then the other part comes out of nowhere. The style of writing is similar to ee cumings style where puncuation and sentence structure are meaningless.All in all, it was a very good read. Not the best, but something that made me sit and think a bit."
2,Episodic and uninteresting.,I was really looking forward to reading this book. Sadly I found it to be just a string of not very interesting scenes between characters I didn't care about.I have not read any other Cormac Mccarthy books and I won't be in a hurry to after this one.
1,Stupid,The book is way too long and monotonous. How stupid was the ending too?! If you really want to read this book then read the first and last 10 pages. The middle is a waste of time. And what is up with not putting the apostrophe in all the contractions? A complete waste of my time!
1,I would have given no stars,"I was so glad not to have purchased this book. I found this an amateurish writing. I think if a high school or college student passed this in to a competent English teacher he or she would not receive a good grade. It was repetitive and was totally unrealistic. The dialogue between the child and the man seemed derivative of A. A. Milne, although I consider Milne the much better writer. As to the author having won the Pulitzer Prize, it again reminds me of the meaninglessness of so many once respected prizes."
1,Why all the Fuss,Most depressing book I've ever read.. Best parts of the book are when the man and boy find a little food. I don't understand what the critics see in this book.
5,Five stars not even close,"This is one of the greatest novels I have ever, and will ever read. Harrowing, beautiful, and completely unforgettable. At times I just had to put the book down and walk away, I was almost too frightened to read what may come next. I don't think any other book has caused me actual PAIN. Like another reviewer, I refused to see the film, no matter how superb it promised to be. As a mother of boys, I just couldn't put myself there again. Astonishing work."
2,Not my cup of tea,I am just a regular gal and this book just did nothing for me. It was just too gloom & doom. Seems my reviews are different from the crowd but I just didn't enjoy it.
2,The Road is long...,"...too long convey its story effectively. There are both horrifying and touching parts of the story, but in between are long stretches of nothing interesting, as gray and bleak as the world the author shows the reader. Dad loves his son, so much he will (literally) walk across the country to try and get him to any kind of safety or give him any kind of future. I found the story far too meandering and repetitive at points to convey the story effectively, McCarthy could have accomplished the same in a much shorter narrative and still registered the same points with the readers."
1,Waste of time and money,"This is the one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was a total waste of time and money. In fact, I was so depressed after I finished reading it that I felt I must write this review to notify potential buyers to ""beware"". Like other reviewers have previously written, it is like a fourth grader could have written it and it was boring and depressing."
1,Blunder Down The Road,A rather depressing tale of woe set in the aftermath of a nuke winter in the lives of a man and his son. We never find out any names to give the man and his son human faces in their blundering way to the coast. I still can't believe I hung in and finished this awful story.
5,Not for those seeking redemption,"For those of us seeking 'character development' or some kind of faint hope, be prepared to be disappointed. There's nothing left. There is no thing to be sentimental about.It's bleak, cold and unnerving.What would you do?Do you believe in god?Do you believe in nothing?Be prepared to back it up.It's a well written easy read if you're looking at the mechanics.If you're looking at other attributes, it's a pretty good book."
5,Very haunting and beautiful,"I read this book a few years ago and was very haunted by it. It is beautifully written and very moving. Though nightmarish and something I can imagine happening for real, there is pain, suffering, sadness, hope, love and something beautiful about this book. There is something special about how Mr. McCarthy writes. His writing moves me to the core and I almost always have nightmares or weird dreams when reading one of his books. His writing is something very special."
4,Good apocalyptic novel!,"I love this genre of writing. I made sure to read this before I watched the movie and I'm glad I did. The book is much better! He does an excellent job of getting you to feel the emotion of the characters come through. You can feel the desperation, fear, sadness,etc. not a feel good read at all but a good tale none the less."
4,Post apocalyptic world written with great literary prose,"The Road is a very deep and rich story of the bond between a father and his son while traversing a post apocalyptic world. The father and son endure great hardship and McCarthy does a great job exploring the feelings associated with this hardship, as well as the world around them. McCarthy describes things beautifully with rich literary prose. Though the book is well written - and even a slight challenge for me - I found the story to not be as rich as I hoped. In a post apocalyptic world, there is really so much to explore, however McCarthy is limited by writing through the eyes of only these two individuals.McCarthy excels at writing and also wrote a good story, however, the story wasn't exceptional and didn't meet my expectations for a post apocalyptic world. As such, a four star review (I like it) vs a five star review (I love it) seemed appropriate."
1,Not an easy read!,I think this is the most difficult book I've ever read and I'm an avid reader. It was very hard to understand what caused the apocolyptic event. The conversations between father and son were not exciting. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,"Belongs with ""The Plot against America""...","in a bookshelf of two books that are mediocre representatives of their genre, getting incredible praise because they are written by people seen as having literary chops.Never goes anyhere, doesn't make sense, and the ending is an enormous cop out."
1,It was ok,"I have to apologize I originally reviewed the wrong book here. The Road was an ok book. I don't think it was good enough to be a best seller, but might be worth the read."
1,A waste of time and money,"I bought this book because of the good reviews, I should have known better. It was a painstacking read. Good writing style but a whole lot of nothing in the contents and worse the all lot of nothing happened over and over again, talk about redundance. I kept waiting it would improve so I did go to the end, a waste of time. As soon as I finished the last page I threw the book away as I would never ever recommend it or give it to a friend, that would make for a sorry gift!"
1,Part of my life I will never get back,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Not only was written poorly, and in a short paragraph format, it was too pretentious. The only reason I finished it was because I was hoping everyone would die."
3,Disappointed,"I've been on my local library's waiting list for this book since its release - after finally reading it, it's a disappointment. A description of a desolate land with a few animal-like humans left roaming the land, and the two ""good guys"" a father and son. A few days in their lives followed by an ending that is completely implausible (based on the few encounters the father and son have had with any other humans.) Too many missing pieces to add up to a satisfying reading experience. 12/11/06"
2,The Emperor has no prose.,"I am a Cormac Mccarthy fan and believe the Border Trilogy will be a literary classic for generations to come. This bit of overwritten pretension is more like Waiting for Godot without wit or style. I am a Faulkner fan, too, but would not recommend The Fable to newcomers. The Road is similar, all symbolism without character, never to have found a publisher without the author's fame and unlikely to find many readers in the future. No Country for Old Men was a delight and I believe this book is an anomaly. As the post-nuclear wasteland of The Road points out over and over, mistakes do happen and I look forward to the author's next book."
1,not reccomended.,This book sucked. I only read half of it before i had to put it down. And i havent picked it up since. this is one time the Movie is better than the book. The diolog was hard to under stand.you couldnt tell who was talking. its just not a book for people who are looking for a survival story...
1,The Road,"Time out, how many people have actually read this book? I teach reading and English in high school. Next year in I will be teaching 5th grade in an elementary school. I am an old dog wtih a Masters as a Reading Specialist, age 57 and have been teaching most of my adult life. This book is the most horrible book I have read. Don't get me wrong the story line is great. Father & son battle to survive the end of the World. But page after page of ""I'm Ok are you OK"" and the constant walk to no where with no climax anywhere, ICK!!!. The dialouge is stale and without a doubt is dead form start to finish. My question to all of the other reviewers, is everyone jumping on the bandwagon or what? I may have to start my own book review club with real honest to goodness reviews. Come on poeple call it like it is this book needs to die a fast death unlike this lame story!!!"
1,Awful waste of time,"I have no idea why Oprah and her readers liked this book so much! The plot hinges on coincidence and doesn't stand up to too much thinking. Things happen at the right time (for the author), but not likely if this were actually happening.Bad waste of time."
2,Some good turns of phrase amid a vast wasteland of bad grammar,"This book is stream-of-conciousness rambling that gets tedious quickly. The author does convey emotion well. Unfortunately, the only emotion in the book is flagging hope in the middle of a world of despair.The plot grows thin after a few pages. The man and the boy are starving. They find food. They're starving. They find food. They're starving. And now you get the idea.The ending of the book is as out-of-place as the ending to Ecclesiastes. After a very depressing trudge, ""God"" is suddenly the answer.Read a few pages. Feel bad for the main characters? You've now read the novel. There's no need to suffer through the text."
2,Contrived,"In some undefined apocalypse, every large plant and animal dies except the protagonist, his son and a few other humans that turn to cannibalism to survive.No fish, no birds, no trees. No cockroaches, flies, mosquitoes, moss or lichen. But food rots, corpses smell and the heroes get sick. Obviously, bacteria and viruses are alive and kicking. Oh, and a few morel mushrooms made it, to feed our heroes once.In any world where a few humans survive for more than a year, you would at least expect some seeds to make it too. You'd expect insects to thrive. Plant growth would resume soon despite the meager sunshine. But the author doesn't let reality impinge on a comfortable construction of a setting where good and evil are so easy to pit against each other.The novel is a sequence of scenes of sadness and despair only possible because of a very contrived yet simplistic setting. Couldn't enjoy it."
4,Read 'til the end of The Road,"Although this story started off slow, it enticed me enough that I wanted to know more. It didn't take long to get me totally involved, wanting only the best for this father and son as they struggled in so many ways physically and emotionally. I loved the way the author kept the text simple- almost archaic- without quotations; it gave me the feeling of their world being without something and missing so much more. I couldn't put it down until I finished the last page. I wonder if the author has intentions of continuing the story? I would definitely read it!"
4,Book of Hope,"I could say that this was a very bleak book, but instead, I will say that it became very apparent after 20 or 30 pages that it is anything but. Even with desolation everywhere, this is a book about hope, and specifically, the God of Hope. Why else would anyone continue on this journey through ash and despair? The author does indeed spell this out for us by the end of the book. One scene in particular where the father speaks made me think of my father and how he always said, ""Life's a journey. Enjoy the ride!"" and, ""I just want for you to be happy. I want my family to be happy."""
4,Post-Apocalyptic Poetry,"This post-apocalyptic journey is written in prose, but I found it quite poetic. Fitch presented a fascinating picture of a very real (to me) possible future. McCarthy used almost no puncuation besides periods, and mainly very simple tenses. This gave the feeling of no past and no future, each day continuing with no change, and no thoughts of life beyond the moment."
3,"Interesting, but not for the genre","The book itself is okay in that it does describe what a post-apocalyptic world maybe like and removes most of the romanticism associated with it. If you are wanting to read a book that takes an artistic approach to dialogue and character development then this book is for you.However, if you are really into the the post-apocalyptic genre then this book may be a great disappointment, other then as mention gets rid of some of the romanticism of it and places the harsh reality of an end of the world scenario in front of you. Compared to classics like ""Earth Abides"" and ""Atlas, Babylon"" this book just does not compare."
3,Not up to the hype,"I've read post-apocalyptic tales before. I've read tales of fathers and sons.There are key elements missing in this story. Specifically: plot line. Man and boy walk down the road, while wonderful descriptions of a bleak landscape are recited. But other than that, almost nothing happens. Oh, there are a couple of encounters, but none fleshed out to the point where there is a significant action sequence or tension, beyond the steady grinding of death by starvation.This is nothing that hasn't been done better by any number of authors. Perhaps the rabid fans of this novel have not read any of these types of stories before, but there's nothing that makes this better, or even as good, as many of the others out there."
4,Will stand as one of the best books of our time,"McCarthy's ""The Road"" begins a tale of the bleakest subject matter with, fittingly, succinct, bleak prose- but don't let this stop you from reading it.A man and his son are in movement across a burned American landscape, with nothing but the clothes on their back, and a shopping cart of provisions. Difficult as it was to get through the first pages, I pressed on and found that the way McCarthy describes the events of the book--slowly, flatly, and devoid of gratuitous language/metaphor--actually very much lends itself to the subject matter. At the core, this book is about survival; about two humans beings against the earth, without a single barrier.McCarthy absolutely masterfully conveys the beauty of this, as well as the sheer horror of it-- One of the best books I've ever read."
2,Not what I expected.,I didn't like that you never knew what happened to start the story. The father and son were just on the road. It was also depressing and it left you hanging. I was pretty disappointed.
2,"A review of the process of getting the book, rather than the book itself","I ordered ISBN#9780307387899 and got ISBN#9780307277923. The book is for a class, so the pagination has to be correct. I emailed Amazon/apex_media about the problem, telling them that if the pagination was not the same as the edition I'd originally ordered, I'd not be able to use the edition they sent me. They responded with a refund, which is great, but it would have been helpful to know about the pagination issue. I love Amazon and this disappoints me. Amazon's page on ISBN#9780307277923 says that it has 272 pages. The book I received with that ISBN# is numbered to 287."
3,"truly a ""used"" book","i had to buy this to replace one that was both required for school and misplaced. as such, i didn't want to pay too much, and i got what i paid for...a ""used"" book. this has nothing to do with the vendor. it came well-packaged and on schedule. and it came complete with high-lights, underlines, and annotated margins..."
5,Hauntingly Fantastic,I was frightened and later haunted by this excellent book. it has changed the way I look at the world.
5,"Bleak, yet filled with beauty and hope","This is much more than a story of a bleak and dark post-apocalypse, although it is that. There is a wonderful tenderness in this story of the epic journey south of this unnamed father and son. It reminds me of the story in Cold Mountain. This is beautifully written. I disagree with the reviewers who write about the absence of plot. I found the main characters engaging and quite moving. I couldn't put the book down."
3,"Beautiful language, repetitive and annoying plot.","The descriptive language used in this book is masterful. McCarthy really paints a brilliant picture with his words. However, that's about where the brilliance stops for me. Nothing happens! This is such a slow and boring read. The times which were supposed to build suspense lacked it in my opinion. At risk of giving up the plot of the book, the plot consists of walking, starving, and sleeping in the cold. The dialogue can also be confusing as there are no quotations and it is sometimes hard to tell who is speaking. Not a moving read as I had hoped it would be. I was actually rooting for death just so something would happen."
5,High water mark,"Among the great ""journey stories"" I have read. Beautiful in the ugliness of this end world, and in the hopeful allegory of man's inner struggle to remain humane though the struggle that is life. I have read other works by Cormac McCarthy and am frankly stunned by the depth and imagination of the book even if Oprah likes it."
4,Is it just me...?,"...or does McCarthy totally overuse the word ""okay"" in almost every exchange of dialog between the man and the boy? It actually gets annoying after a while. Nobody says okay that much!!! Aside from that, it is a very good and disturbing novel that portrays exactly the world that humanity will deserve after a nuclear war."
3,father and son in a post apocalyptic world,"I found this something of a chore to be honest. The writing style didn't keep me focussed, especially for the first 100 pages or so.As the Man and the Boy travel through a post apocalyptic country, fighting against cold and hunger and avoiding the gangs of cannibals, I couldn't help thinking this would have been better pruned down somewhat.The most moving aspect of the novel for me was loss of innocence in the Boy's having to confront the reality of their situation: their impotence to help others for fear of losing their own lives. Although the Man repeatedly tells the child that they are the good guys, the Boy can't square that with what he sees.And after an unremittingly stark novel I'm not sure that the end wasn't unrealistically optimistic.For a truly horrific tale of a futuristic world, Kazuo Ishiguro's 'Never let me go' wins hands down."
1,HATED IT!,"I read this book on vacation and hated every page of it. I found it to be extremely boring, dark, and unsatisfying. I appreciate the talent of the author, but this just wasn't my cup of tea."
1,Okay.,"I read this and couldn't help but think that this was more of a writer's experiment than anything else. I mean, it's okay, but it's merely that--okay. I've read much better.I felt like I was reading Steinbeck--admittedly, not my favorite literary person--and this is the kind of literature where the meaning behind the story is more important to the telling of it, and I found my self not really enjoying this one much at all. It's not that the sadness of it all didn't bother me, far from it. It was that there really wasn't that much substance to it at all.If you want to read a strong post-apocalyptic story, read ""Alas, Babylon"" by Pat Frank--there's so much more heart in it than this one."
1,Should be sold with anti-depressants,"When it was the hot book of the moment, thanks to Oprah, I decided to give it a try.Wow was that a mistake. I feel like I'm the only one who can say the emperor is naked. This book was a horrible, dreary, pointless slog of a story.In the end I just felt depressed and deprived of many hours of my life."
2,Weak!,The actual writing is ok The story just goes on and on...minimal details of what happened to the world. Just barely more fun than watching paint dry!
5,Brilliant!,"My #2 favorite Cormac McCarthy book (after ""No Contry.."") . Please don't see the movie till you've read the book.. it doesn;t do justice to this haunting, spare story..."
2,Not for scientists,"The book is engagingly written and passionate. Hard to put down after you start. Unless you're a scientist. I initially liked the story, but eventually the details got to me.In my mind, the most egregious was how the characters are able to wander around with only face masks for breathing, when the ecosystem is so destroyed that there are no visible signs of plant life or even bacteria. Any disaster that will destroy other lifeforms so thoroughly is going to burn the skies so humans can't survive, either.After that became clear, things went downhill for me, as I let myself be distracted by, for example, the use of a shopping cart to drag supplies along the road years after the road became unmaintained"
1,The Road-long & dull,"This book is way over hyped. I had been hearing about how great it was for months. Well being deployed overseas to Afghanistan one finds the time to catch up on reading. One of my co-workers happened to have a copy of ""The Road"" so I took it and began reading. With each chapter you'll be wishing for excitement, danger, and climax. Well you can forget it! What you will get is long drawn out go nowhere plot. About all you will get is, The man loved the boy, they continued to walk, they ate pears, or fruit cocktail one night, they had to keep moving, it was cold, the boy was crying. Yeah, there you have it; I just saved you a few hours wasted on this novel. Being that it was on Oprah's book list should've tipped me off from the beginning. I can only hope they figure out a way to make the movie exciting because the book is a huge disappointment."
2,IT AINT 'GOING MY WAY.',I love NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and revere BLOOD MERIDIAN but THE ROAD stopped me in my tracks. Boring.
1,I wish i could rate this book in the negative,"I picked up this book because of its premise, a father and son traveling in a post-apocalyptical America. However, I quickly became frustrated with the author's writing style. His attempt to be ""different"" leads him to the disastrous decision not to use any punctuation marks. Further, he never names his characters or gives them any type of personality. I found this book to be one dimensional, flat, extremely repetitive and boring. I have no idea how this book has become so popular or why it has garnished national acclaim. For me, this is a big zero."
1,"Never been a McCarthy fan, and I'm still not","I struggled through the text, but I did read it from start to finish. Cormac McCarthy is trying to create a self-reflective main character, but the problem is the character never stops blaming himself for every sin in the world. He comes across as shallow, narcissistic, and delusional. If you're looking for good post-apocalyptic fiction skip this one and go forEternity Road,The Postman, orOn the Beach."
2,Not Great,"This book does not deserve the hype it has been given. In my opinion it was mediocre. I love depressing stories, so that is not my complaint. I didn't find it to be as amazing as so many others did. The style is fine and his unconventional dialog did not bother me. I loved the idea of the book. It just didn't follow through. It's a quick read though so by all means, give it a chance if you are curious."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"I had high hopes when I began reading this book. But by the end of the book, all I could think was why? Why would this man continue to torture himself and his son, day after day, for what? Nothing. I found no hope in this book, nor even a point to it. The imagery of the world after the ""unexplained"" catastrophic event, was vivid. That was the only thing I took away from this ultimately disappointing read."
2,Not what I expected.,"This one was a bit disappointing. I found myself more interested in learning of the cause of the apocalyptic event than the plight of the characters. Yes, I get that the disaster is supposed to be secondary to this story. Was the lack of punctuation supposed to be `edgy'? There were conversations between the `man and the boy' that spanned an entire page that consisted of two word sentences. The flashback component was a bit too vague to help with the character development. If you are considering this book because you like the author's style, then you will probably not be unhappy. If, however, you are looking for an actual complete post-apocalyptic novel, then check out `Free Flight', `Down to a Sunless Sea' and of course `Alas, Babylon'."
2,Not worth it,"Not worth the read.Is it science fiction? Where is the explanation for the disaster? Humans are the only species to survive? No roaches or rodents, not even a seed?Too unbelievable with no explanation.Ok, so it's not science fiction. Is is a character study between father and son? No, There is minimal dialog and no character development.Is it an examination of a man's thoughts as he forges on toward certain death? Not really, we don't learn much about his thoughts, just witness the blundering on to an unknown goal.I found nothing intriguing about this book. It was simply a narration of a despondent man stumbling forward out of obligation when any sense of life had already flickered out in him. It could have at least discussed the motivations of a man in this state, but didn't. It more or less just stated what was done.At least it was short."
3,An Okay read,"This book disappointed me. The reviews were great, but once i started reading it I was left with too many questions. The author uses a unique dialect that I cannot place, and the word order gets confusing. The reader is left with trying to figure out the background of the story themselves. It is entertaining, but no strong background or ending."
2,What was Oprah thinking?,"When I heard Oprah talk about this book and the messages therein, I picked up a copy right away. I thought eventually the story would pick up and the point would eventually become evident, but I was wrong. As others on this site have noted, it was just dark, depressing and redundant. I did find the prose interesting, but often found myself having to re-read certain passages in order to determine who was saying what, thanks to McCarthy's lack of puncuation. Thankfully, it was a quick read so not too much time wasted."
4,"Extremely Depressing, but very Powerful...","This was a tough book to read. As the father of three children in this era of global terrorism and saber rattling governments, it was not hard to put myself in the position of the protagoninst of the novel.Would I be able to do what this Father did? Would I rather not face those difficult times? Or would I be able to give my kids some kind of semblance of hope.I can't say I've ever read another book like The Road. It will haunt me for a long time."
2,Why is this considered a good read?,Let me save you the trouble of reading:One day a son and his father walk along a road and feed on scraps of food and hide from 'bad' strangers. => Repeat ad nauseum => The EndIt's interspersed with sudo-poetic gibberish in random spots just for further annoyance.Have no idea why the critics rate it so highly. Just my opinion.
3,"Interesting themes, and lots and lots of darkness and despair","There are interesting human themes that run throughout The Road; 1) Working together is better than alone, 2) Humans can survive through unimaginably horrible conditions, and 3) Love is the strongest bond of all. Beyond that, the book is filled with page after page of darkness and cold, utter hopelessness and despair, hunger and savagery, greed and cannibalism, fear and sadness, and a continuing sense of endless nothingness. As I moved toward the end of the book, I kept hoping that I would be presented with some sense of hope for the future. Unfortunately, that wasn't to be. If this is what the future holds I'll gladly move on to my next lifetime, because anything would be better than the darkness that awaits those that still survived in this book."
3,The Road -- a rocky road indeed!,"The book was well-written, with some uplifting insight about ""human nature"". Worth reading, but a little too relentlessly dreary. And not quite credible enough in terms of the details of what happens, how they cope, etc."
5,The Road,"A brilliant, horrifying tale of a father and son's survival after the earth's destruction. There is a lesson to be learned but be warned; not for the feint of heart."
2,Civilization is a Very Thin Veneer,"I disliked this book so much thatfor the first time in my life, I threw a book in the trash. The only reason I give it two stars is that the novel shows that society reverts to anarchy if civilization as we know it is destroyed.I don't want to give the ending away so I will state that I don't understand why so many people are raving about it. The man is amoral at best and the ending is so contrived, it's laughable."
4,the ride,"it was one of those books you couldnt put down but you wished you could-- a father and son tragic journey across a country that is no more-- what a sad concept,but a real possibity..written so well, i felt as if i had traveled along with them..get ready for a ride"
2,Dark with no salvation,"Reading is, for me, instructive, uplifting, entertaining, or enlightening. To be dark without any of the other attributes feels like a waste of time. This book wasted my time. I already know how cruel humans can be, and how badly we treat the planet. I kept waiting for the moral to rise out of the ashes, but none did."
3,A short story inserted with 150 pages of the same thing,"It seems that everyone is enthralled with the sparseness and despair in the writing and the story. That's all well and good but could it have been said just as well in 125 pages? I think so. I understand wanting to bring home the message of a post apocalyptic world, but when you can't tell one page of starving from another.....I read this to the end out of sheer perverseness. I kept thinking that there would be a point (besides the 'good' people I was pretty sure they would find at the end). My daughter tried to read it and gave up. When I asked her where, she said "" I don't know, somewhere where they are starving, and it's snowing and they are wet"".Based on this book, I would not take another chance on a McCarthy novel. I may be shallow, but if I am not being entertained by a book, I want to learn, be awed by the prose or be asked to rethink a belief. This novel did none of these."
2,THE ROAD TO NOWHERE,"What a disappointment! How many times can you read about 2 people getting up in the morning (or not getting up), walking down a road (or not walking down the road), scrounging for food (and always seeming to find it when desparately needed)? I was waiting for the big payoff but it never came. Interesting dialog is non-existant. The few characters they meet are usually dismissed in a few pages or less. Booooring! My first kindle book was a dud."
3,The Road to Nowhere,"The title of this review pretty much sums up my feelings about the book. The Road was neither a terrible nor great read. Yes, it was descriptive at some points. There was some great imagery. But I felt like it was very repetitive. The author didn't delve too deeply into how the world ended up in a post-apocalyptic environment. There wasn't a whole lot of character development, therefore I felt detached from the characters causing me to not feel too much empathy for the characters. I was expecting a bit more excitement and a deeper plot. This isn't to say that it isn't worth reading, but don't expect a page turner that will keep you up all night."
3,"Good, but not great","I read this book right after it came out, long before Oprah put it on her book club. I was the first one I knew to have read it, and therefore I think I had a very unbiased opinion of the book. It's a good read, and an interesting topic, but not a great dystopian work. McCarthy does an amazing job describing the hardships with finding food and shelter, as well as the fear of others, but after that I thought the story began to lack. I would have felt as satisified with this work had it been a short story or novella."
3,"Good, but not great","Mr McCarthy is a brilliant writer, but this is far from his best work. Of course, if you enjoyed ""Child of God"", then this is probably right up your alley."
1,Gray,"GRAY, ash, black, gray, cold, ash, gray, gray, black, cold, gray, hungry, gray, ash, black, cold, road, gray, ash, ""Okay?"", ""Okay, poppa"".There. I have just saved you the trouble of reading this interminably dreary and interminably repetitious, repetitious, repetitious, repetitious, repetitious, repetitious book. (Did I mention that it's repetitious? Because it's really repetitious.)Depending on how fast you read, you owe me several/many hours of your life.You're welcome."
3,No signposts at the end of the road,at the end of the world there will be no apostrophes no punctuation no quotation marks and you wont know who is speaking in a page of dialogue or when the story takes place or where but it wont matter because the homeless nameless main character and nameless child wander from point A to point B surviving day by day on the road.
1,Over my head,"I read it. But being a post-apocalyptic fan, this story felt short. The relationship between the father and the son was endearing, but the simplicity of the story which most people seemed to enjoy was actually what I enjoyed the least. It felt like I was watching an incredibly slow movie that would end up getting an Oscar.Everyone is entitled to they're own opinion, but for post-apoc fans, I don't think you'll dig this one too much. But hey I might be wrong. I def was annoyed by the language throughout the whole book. But then again I didn't see what the big deal was abt. No Country for Old men either, so gauge this review on that."
2,What's the fuss about?,The Road was a so-so post apocalypse tale of the dead and dying as father and son scramble for subsistence living; facing hope and lawlessness. No big deal. Derivative of more compelling reads in this genre. Author should thank his lucky stars Oprah and her gang of dimwits picked this up as it has no other merits.
4,Slightly Overrated,"Good book but didn't quite live up to the hype. Takes a little getting into, but a quick read once you force yourself through the first quarter of the book. Lack of quotation marks actually makes it a little more interesting and a faster book."
2,very overrated,"i found this book very overrated. i kept reading it because it is well-written, but i found myself skipping small sections because nothing was happening! i am of the opinion that books need to have a plot, not just set a scene. if the author can't be bothered to think up a plot, why should i slog through the whole book? i read it because it got such good reviews, but for the life of me, i can't imagine why."
3,What?,"I am not sure how I feel about this book. It doesn't really go anywhere or really say anything. Some people do bad things and others do good things. There are no names, there are no locations, and there is no indication of what happened to put the characters in the situation that they are in. The book has the tendency to put images in your mind that you don't want there. It is a quick read. I am not sure how I would even classify this book. It almost seems like a synopsis of a book rather than a book itself."
1,Snooze fest,"Paragraph after paragraph....after paragraph, and more paragraphs. This book is way to repetitive for my taste. Dark, grey, ash...bullcrap. Choppy like my review."
2,not for me,This book was ok. It really didn't have me turning pages and I thought it was quite boring. I usually love emotional books but this one didn't keep me interested
3,I was not impressed,"I picked this book out at a local used book store and immediately thought I'd love it. I also noticed the Oprah's book club sticker so I figured it couldn't be bad. I was definitely dissapointed. Now, don't get me wrong, this book may be very impressive to some of you but I don't like the style it is written in. Overall, I felt like the book was uneventful - 80% of the book talks about walking around and eating canned beans and only 20% of it seems to have good action in it. Yes, I know that the setting needs to be described and suspense built up and I know I'm supposed to use those less action-packed moments to get to know the characters but I just wasn't a fan of the writing style and I think that is what attracts most of the good reviews to this book. I guess I went into it expected something different and was dissapointed, but this is just my opinion and my review."
1,TItle of the book about as imaginative as the plot.,"I've been trying to read this book for about six months, and I can never get more than 1/3 of the way through. It's frusterating because I have yet to read a negative review, so I assume it must just be because I am stupid that I don't like the book.It's the end of the world and a father and son are traveling down a road. That's it? Yes, that's it. Maybe if the father's narrative used proper grammar and actually said things that made sense, it might have had more meaning, but as it is it is just meaningless garbage.Every other page is a description of them building a fire and burning a tin can of food, and almost every paragraph ends like this: What is it, Papa? I don't know.Eventually, I decided not to waste another minute of my life reading it and built a fire with it, keeping myself and my child (each the other worlds entire) warm as we ate from a tin can. What is it, he asked? I didn't know."
2,Disappointing,I guess I was expecting something different. This book is more a collection of short stories (rarely longer than a paragraph or page) or prose than a novel. Essentially you can open any page and start reading without missing a beat. Didn't care for it.
3,Did not live up to the hype,"It is a rare feeling in a `classic' book to find the two hundredth page almost identical to the first.Perhaps the author's intention was to show the bleak repetition of desolation. If so, then he succeeded.As expected the book is filled with stunning lines.`By day the banished sun circles the Earth like a grieving mother with a lamp.'It was beautiful, poetic, occasionally moving and yet... for me at least... a touch too uneventful."
3,Overhyped,"I think this is an interesting story that keeps the reader enthralled, but in spite of that I was not as moved as most of the reviewers below.Essentially, this is simply the story of a father and son as they struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic world and deal with some moral and ethical conundrums. Perhaps I have read too many stories like this in the past, but McCarthy's ability to set the scene and tell a captivating story does not make this book live up to its hype. One huge contributing factor is probably that halfway though the book I could tell, with a little help from the summary on the back cover, how the story was going to end.In my opinion this is a great book, but it fails to live up to the hype."
3,Hemingway Prose without a Hemingway Plot,"I enjoyed reading the book, but I doubt I'll read it again. Some books you can read again and again, but I don't think this will be one of them.I know it's a Pulitzer prize winning book and I'm the Honors English ""C"" student from high school years ago...But I give this book a ""3"".The prose is enjoyable and has its own richness. I certainly felt that the prose had the simplicity of Hemingway if Hemingway had decided to use larger, unusual words.But the plot is simple, and predictable. As I read the book, and unfortunately began skimming a little on the last 30 pages I decided either there would be a hopeful ending or a dismal ending. I guessed correctly on the ending.But as I said, the book was enjoyable. For comparison sake I'll read another book by McCarthy. This time I'll just go to the library and see if I can find one to read for free."
4,Serious and timely work,"This novel is less quite brief but it is in no way ""light"" reading. It's involves a post-apocalyptic world. There are no discussions as to exactly what happened but it becomes clear that the world and humanity is near ended. My one criticism is that there is just too much cooperation, too much toleration, and not enough anger for the plight in which the father-young son characters tolerate to survive (maybe they are numb). Judge for yourself. The story is more than somber, it is your worst nightmare. I highly recommend it. Once you start the book you will be compelled to endure it to it's finish. I know I should be read again but I don't read books twice - but maybe this will be my first time."
5,the road,"i thoroughaly enjoyed reading this adventure of the man and the boy. i couldn't put this book down, i had to find out what was coming next. i had such empathy for the characters and i wanted to know that they would make it okay. the ending was incredible being both sad and hopeful for the future."
4,provoking,I had a hard time putting this book down. It was a very easy read. Very moving and filled with imagery. It was hard not to imagine our world identical to this. Nuclear proliferation is all around us and one wrong move by a rouge government could create havoc similar to this.
4,Just wonderful,"This brilliant book covering the world after the nuclear holocaust follows the story of privation and hardship and the love of life between ffather and son in a world gone gray. A true story of foreboding and love and the greatness of being alive. This is about struggle, there is little love of the protagonist and the reader sometimes gets a little sidelined, but this is McCarthy at his best, a truly wonderful book, everyone will be suprised by the twists and turns and reverberations for our modern culture.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,Kindle text to speech - a deal breaker,"I apologize if this review may not be helpful to people wanting to evaluate the content of ""The Road,"" but I wanted to provide feedback on the container. Specifically, I was prepared to purchase the Kindle edition of this book until I saw the note that the ""text-to-speech"" feature was ""not enabled."" According to Amazon, ""The publisher has requested not to enable Text-to-Speech for this title."" If the publisher is so short-sighted or greedy that they believe that a feature of my Kindle cannibalizes their audiobook sales, I would prefer not to deal with them. Look forward to purchasing from more Kindle-friendly publishers."
2,Long and Dark,"This book was recommended to me by someone whose opinion I trusted and respected. After reading the novel, he is definitely out of my ""circle of trust"" when it comes to book recommendations.As some of the other reviewers mentioned, the lack of punctuation is frustrating. I think I became mentally tired of reading this book because of all the run on sentences.And, did I mention long and dark? I thought the depressing escapades of the father and son would never end. After a while I started to think the ""mother"" in the story had the right idea (not to give away anything to the brave souls who will still read this book after my review.) I know I was driven to that point several times while reading this book.A rating of two may be generous on my part, but I couldn't in good conscious give any written literature a one. I know a lot of hard work went into this novel - even if I was too dense to appreciate it."
5,The Best Book I've Read This Year,"I just read this book about a week ago, and I absolutely cannot stop thinking about it. Cormac McCarthy is an incredible writer. I'm astonished by the negative reviews here. Sure, he dislikes standard punctuation, but that's his style--and it's not hard to overcome. This is one of the best post-apocalyptic novels I've ever read, and I've read many. I'd give it six stars if I could."
5,"Easy Read, but POWERFUL!",This book is such an easy read; such a deceptively easy read. But I must say I have never experienced such love and horror so powerfully and simply expressed. The author is masterful.
5,A Jarring Novel,"I read this book in less than two days. It is a quick and jarring read. McCarthy creates a black ashen world where humans eat each other and where life is almost meaningless. The only thing keeping the main character going is the love of his son.It is a bit of an assault to read through 200+ pages of barren, ashen landscape and languid prose. Yet the final paragraph/epilogue put it all together for me and elevated this book into a remarkable commentary on those who say we are more important than the Earth or that we can live without our planet. George Monbiot's review is especially poignant for me. This truly is the ultimate eco-novel and I mean that in a completely non-political sense. There is nothing political about loving our planet. And the view McCarthy gives us of a world that we have rejected and that has in turn rejected us is the ultimate warning to appreciate our blessings."
2,Not so good,"Carefully checking the other readers' reviews has successfully predicted many good reads for me, but that system failed me on this one. I'm just not that into the apocalypse, I guess."
3,got through it quickly and it was ok ...,"but, I don't think it's a ""must read"" at all. Like others have said, the walking, foraging and constant focus on the shopping cart was very repetitive and kind of boring. Nonetheless, the book was gratefully short enough to get to the end to see if anything happens. You do have to have suspend your common sense to even believe that the man and the boy survived this tragedy that had befallen the world. With no plant life, no clean air to breathe, scarcity of clean water, the premise is totally implausible. That aside, there was something that did strike me. I found it totally depressing the way other survivors were described and how everyone was so fearful of eachother. (Ok, we get the message - people suck. We get that dog-eat-dog feeling every day to a certain degree, without the end-of-world scenario.) The best part of the book for me was learning what people had put away in their disaster preparedness kits. That's probably good information to have."
3,A bleak and dismal journey,"I decided to finally read this novel long after its peak last year when the author won another Pulitzer. What inspired me was the compelling, THE CROSSING and seeing the film version of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.So the first thing, as many have already stated, is the author is taking a diversion from his usual path. And it's a bleak look into a world that could come about. A theme so many sci-fi books have covered and, perhaps, far better than what McCarthy attempts to capture here.I thought it was worth a read, but not his best. The idea is to get the reader to contemplate big thoughts about life and how we must preserve the planet we have, but there are other books that moved me more."
4,The Road is written like a poem,"The Road is written like a beautiful poem. I love the descriptions, the understated horror, and the love between father and son.This is a beautifully melancholy book and I truly enjoyed it!"
4,Hope,"I couldn't put it down. It is disturbing and dark and enthralling and all-absorbing. Even in the darkest, world-ending time there is still love and hope. The more I think about it, the more I like it."
5,Doesn't get much better than this!,"The utter bleakness of this book whittles down anything that's come before into its most primal and pure expression of life, love, truth and hope. It's hard to write anything about this most perfect of books, that either hasn't been said before, or that will diminish its overwhelming power. Don't talk about this book, just read. Anyone not moved by this book, and its simple story of family love, and survival should see a doctor. Your sense of morality, and goodness will be forever changed. Ok, I'm going to stop talking now. READ IT!"
5,A Classic,I am not sure what emotions surfaced while some of you read this novel.I felt everything. The Road is a father and son must read.
4,The Road - A Post-Apocalyptic Classic,"Cormac McCarthy's writing is different then nearly any other writer out there today. Some find his style a bit disarming and cannot get past the narratives that don't include speaker names or quotation marks. I say, if you can get past the unusual style, you are in for a visual and intellectual treat.This book us unlike any of McCarthy's prior novels and is no where near ""No Country For Old Men"" in style. This tale of a nameless father and son wandering the wastelands of a long destroyed America is one of the most real and tender post-apocalyptic depictions I've ever read. There is no need for explanations of why or how - the reader is simply thrown directly into the ""world"" these two characters find themselves in. They are in a world with little food or shelter and have no idea where or why they are moving towards ""the coast"".It reads quickly but leaves quite an impression. I will be very curious to see if the film version does this great novel any justice."
4,Reflection,"What's interesting about this book is McCarthy never explicitly illustrates what his characters are feeling--it must be inferred by the reader. So in a sense, the only depth this book has is what the reader can bring to it. It's as if The Road were a reflection of the readers' intellectual and emotional capacity. Those who have traveled an arduous but enlightened path to this point in their life will view this book through the insights of those experiences. To these people, the book will reflect great meaning."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I read this book in two sittings. Not only is it an easy read, it is so engrossing that I just couldn't put it down! Stark, beautiful and poetic."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Warning: I could not put this book down once I began. I read it thru a morning and two meals, scarcely looking up to put food in my mouth. I had to know how it ended. From the beginning, I knew it as a novel that would not offer me hope. It follows a father and son as they make their way toward the coast in a post-apocalyptic world where no other plant or animal life exists - only greyness, ash, and at night, a cold so black and deep that it cannot be imagined. They have no names... they are the man and the boy. It is written in a spare language that is itself devoid of light, color, or embellishment. There is only the horror of it all and in the midst of that, the love of the father for the boy and of the boy for the father. And in the end, acceptance."
3,"Good book, now I want to see the movie =)","This was an ""okay"" book for me.At times, it felt like the author was practicing his skills at describing things, because the story didn't go very far.It has a lot of the same elements as many of McCarthy's books: traveling from here to there, taking a long time to do so & looking for food & building fires all the time.I was expecting more from it.But if you're a McCarthy fan, this is a must.And since the movie's coming out soon, you should read it first."
5,Fantastic,"Great book, very vivid, dark, warm, and connective. There's nothing I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. Buy it, read it, enjoy it."
3,The Road Review,"The Road by Cormac McCarthy certainly isn't a light summer beach read but it is an interesting story. It is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the only people left are either cannibalistic or completely hopeless. McCarthy's style of writing is very different in that he does not use any quotations or chapter breaks. Although this adds to the story's idea, it does make it difficult to keep up. I often had to re-read passages and certain sentences because it became difficult to keep track of who was talking or if it was a flashback or not. Over all The Road was an interesting read but a little morbid and hard to follow."
4,"The Road, For Contemporary Fiction","The Road is a lot like bad tasting beer, at first it's just horrible and you don't want to have anything to do with it, but you drink it anyways and slowly but surely after a while it starts to get better and you start to enjoy it the more you read (more beer) and you get drawn to the characters and start to feel for them and relate to them."
1,Fool me once...,"It's not the subject matter...what little of it there is. It's the outrageous gall of a respected author and his publisher to cash in on reputation. And the starry-eyed critics and devoted fans who accept drek as literature provided the right name is on the cover.Other reviewers have amply quoted or parodied the backbone of this story...dreary banal dialogue between a laconic father and his little boy. We get the doting paternal devotion by page 10. We get the cultural collapse and destruction of civilization by page 20. We get the deadly numbing relentlessness of surviving in post-apocalypse America by page 25. And that's all there is, aside from a couple unneeded and not very subtly planted land mines of human perversion. I doubt I'll ever read another work by McCarthy."
1,Simply badly written,"Sentence fragments. Why not use commas? Starting sentences with ""And"". If I had written anything like that in my English classes, I would have been given low grades indeed... or maybe a Pulitzer..."
2,"Long, Depressing, Boring","It seems like each new chapter brings a more grim reality to the father and son wanderers.-- We have seen the future and it is not worth living for. --I also found the writing style a distraction from the purpose of the book. Given the grim subject matter, one might think I would welcome a distraction, but no. I found the lack of apostrophes an only grimmer distraction from the already grim story line.-- We have seen the future and not only is it not worth living for it doesnt use correct punctuation either. --"
1,Just Bad,"The book was redundant, repetitious, mundane, boring...get the idea? The first 275 pages were the same events over and over, then the ending did NOT add to the story. Sorry I took the time to read it."
1,Disappointing,"Great idea for story - badly written. Consists of short paragraphs of repetitious, simple and boring dialogue between the father and son. The two characters have no 'personality' other than trying to survive. In the end, the father dies, leaving the son to be immediately rescued by others who surprisingly appear to be friendly, after a journey where they are encountering others intent on stealing and killing/eating them. Author could have developed the story and characters so much better."
1,At First Glance...,"I picked up this book, read the synopsis on the cover, and said, ""Didn't Octavia Butler already write this book, and extremely well, back in the mid 90's?"" That's as far as I got. My rating (admittedly without having read it), is actually a zero for originality."
3,Stark imagery dressed in emperor's new clothes?,"Having just finished listening to the audio version of this book, I was interested to learn (from reading reviews) about all the issues around his actual writing style (spelling, fragments,etc). In fact, I had a fragmented reaction to this book; on the one hand there are chilling, vivid scenes that I may well long remember. Yet in many ways this was also a dreary, repetitive, even boring experience, almost like Groundhog Day in the sense of narrative deja vu. Yet there also was a darkly moody undercurrent which I admit did contain some emotional power. There is some dramatic tension involved in watching a man try to hold on to human values while trying to survive and raise a son as a good person during horrific times. I can understand how some people could really like this book, and others hate it. Or, like me, be somewhere in between."
2,Two stars only for the writing.,"The story is thin and hard to believe. The bleakness doesn't bother me so much as the lack of any substantiating information, such as how two people could survive at all in such a damaged landscape. It seemed a thin premise on which to hang a story of a father and son in hopeless circumstances. If you can suspend disbelief, it's readable enough, although I don't see much point to it. As character study, it's not in-depth enough. As story, it lacks plot. And as science fiction, it lacks any ideas or philosophy to make it worth reading. It's like an overly drawn-out short story. Vividly done, but pointless."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"The Road is nothing more than ""Waiting for Godot"" and ""Robinson Crusoe"" meets Moses or John the Baptist, depending on how you view the protagonist. The writing was trite, redundant (how many times did the reader really need a detailed description of rain on plastic?), and pedantic.There are thousands of great books out there -- this is a waste of time."
2,An Average Read,"Yes, it was fully of stark, horrifying imagery. Yes, it was about love, and being a parent, and trying to protect innocence where it's nearly impossible to do so. But, I found it a boring read, predictable, and only completed it out of an obligation to myself to do so. I did not like the style of prose, and found it very cold. The story stayed with me for a few day, but so do other books, songs, and movies.Very average."
1,The LONG BORING Road,"Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, booorrrring!!!!!! I wish I could gain back the hours of my life that I wasted reading this awful book. Don't believe all the hype. It seems too many people are getting paid off to write good reviews these days."
