5,"Not Wallace and Gromit, but wonderful in its own way","This is not Wallace and Gromit. Okay.This is not all for children. Okay.That being gotten out of the way, this DVD is brilliant, and well worth it at less than ten bucks. All four items are quite different from each other (besides being quite different from Wallace & Gromit), but each has its particular charms.I allow my 3-year old son to watch the first two (Creature Comforts and Wat's Pig), and he loves them. The other two are a bit more adult."
4,Great -- but 4 short films and nothing else,"""Creature Comforts"" is the name of the first claymation short that is worth the small price of the DVD. The film was done by the creator of the popular ""Wallace & Grommit"" series. It is an documentatry style interview with various British zoo animals about their living conditions. Very hilarious. My favorite is the Brazilian big cat (panther?) that discusses needing space. Although the turtles are a close second with their antics in the background.The other three shorts are watchable, but only so-so. I would not recommend ""Adam"" or ""Not Without My Handbag"" for children. ""Creature Comforts"" would be okay -- but the humor would most likely be over their heads. The remaining ""Watt's Pig"" is okay for kids (I guess) but a bit boring for adults.The DVD had the opportunity to show how the art was done, etc... which would have been very interesting. However, nothing extra is done."
2,Scary! Not for Little Children!,"My two children (ages 4 & 6) LOVE Wallace and Gromit. After reading some of the reviews, we thought they would enjoy this. Not a chance. ""Creature Comforts"" (the only Nick Parks animation on the video) went way over their heads. ""Wad's Pig"" was about the horrors of war, and ""Not Without My Pocketbook"" left them with bad dreams for a month. For adults, it's cute, 3-4 stars, for small kids, 0 stars and this warning! If you want something the whole family will enjoy over and over again, buy the Wallace & Gromit three pack."
3,Womb Review,"I've seen this band and they do work hard to put on a show. Although the band as been through different line ups they still manage to keep everything together. I find that at times the album can be enjoyable and also a little repetitive at the same time. The original lyrics left by a former singer were quite unique and are sung pretty good by their new singer but I'd recommend he work a little harder on his own material. While songs like ""Hassle"" and ""Devotion"" have refreshing lyrics. Some songs like ""Consumed"" kind of make you take the band a little less serious with and I quote ""Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl, she is the bomb.""If you're looking for a cd from a band coming out of Detroit with distinguishing sounds that this might be something to check out otherwise they're just another cliched band like Pressure 4-5 or Papa Roach."
5,Arizing = Amazing,"I have waited for this cd for over a year, and let me just say, that the wait was VERY well worth it.I couldn't make it to the Arizing cd release show, but my friend went and came back and surprised me with my very own copy!Ever since I got it almost a week ago, I have been listening to it NON-STOP.It hasn't left my cd player, unless of course it was to put it in my portable cd player...Womb is absolutely musically, lyrically, and emotionally genius.Everything on it is absolutely beautifully crafted, and I haven't found ONE thing on this disc that I don't like. It's one of those rare occasions where every single track is absoutely unbelievable.All the parts fit perfect with one another, and correspond so well... If there is such a thing as musical perfection, Arizing is the closest thing I can think of to it!"
5,Gift,"I gave this to my granddaughter and she enjoyed reading this book. She is in 2nd grade and it was too easy for her, but she still enjoyed the story."
1,Don't buy these!,"these are not like the other hot spicy slim jims, they are slimy and have a vinegary taste. Don't buy."
3,Asperger's Syndrome,"Everyone writes that Banishing Verona is a love story between an English painter and a pregnant woman. But it's really a novel about Asperper's Syndrome. Livesy mentions it in a note at the end of the book but it's really what the book is all about because the main character, Zeke, suffers from it and it comes into play throughout the book in the way Zeke talks and acts. His fear of flying on a plane and what he does when he's actually on one are symptomatic of his psychological illness, which is the driving point of the book. Of course the other character, Verona, is interesting, too. Or rather her grandfather, Jigger, is interesting, and his story is as important as hers. The love story between Zeke and Verona is really just a plot device to tell the story of Asperger's syndrome, which is a good story to tell because the syndrome was only recognized recently."
3,Has its good points.,"I found this novel somewhat lacking: the plot is rather contrived, and the only well developed secondary character is Zeke's mother. Yet the novel most definitely has its redeeming features. Livesey writes well, so there are many nicely written scenes. Zeke, the main character, is wonderfully likable, and different. He suffers from Asperger syndrome (a mild form of autism), which requires him to be analytical about social skills that most master intuitively (such as interpreting expressions). Yet the Asperger does not define him, so one does not feel he is some kind of archetype. He is honest and caring, but also able to balance his needs against those of other people. ""Banishing Verona"" is a nice read, but if you have not read Livesey before, my recommendation would be to start with ""The Missing World""."
1,Disappointing & Boring,"I found this book to be incredibly boring. I didn't even finish it. Got a little more than halfway through and just decided it wasn't worth my time. If you enjoy ""literary fiction"", then you probably won't enjoy this book. The characters are completely one dimensional and the writing is pedestrian. I was totally disinterested in the story, which was implausible and ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and don't even pick this one up!"
3,Eh....,"""Banishing Verona"" is the story of Verona and Zeke, two people who fall in love due to a very chance encounter. Zeke is a painter, and Verona shows up at the home of one of his clients, claiming to be their niece. Verona and Zeke spend one night together, and then Verona up and disappears. The two main characters appear in only a few scenes together...most of the book focuses on their attempts to come to terms with their own individual lives. This is the first book of Margot Livesey's that I've read, and while I enjoyed her writing style, I though the plot of this book really dragged. I had a hard time connecting with Zeke or Verona, and thought Livesey paid a bit too much attention to detail. It was a very tedious read, and I cannot in good conscience give it a high recommendation."
4,So very Livesey,"Opening a Livesey novel is always an adventure -- she never takes a predictable direction. There is no such thing as a Livesey set of characters or circumstances; no one Livesey book prepares you for the next. She reminds of Anne Tyler in her ability to distill humanity into one reading experience. That said, this one is a star short of her very best, but still compelling and wise. Does it suffice to say that at least three times the combination of the writer's character development and language stopped this reader in his tracks? The equivalent of a concert show-stopper on the page."
2,Basic. Introduction to VBA and not a good reference book!,"Thinking that the best people to write a book on Visual Basic for Apps are the people who created the product, I sent off for this book. I was disappointed to discover that a LOT of features of the VBA language were left out. I think the book is a good introduction to the language for beginners or those who know just a little ordinary VB, and who are willing to spend the time going chapter-to-chapter. It is NOT a good reference manual however, as it leaves major chunks of the language out, and the index is not very comprehensive. I now have to go buy a QUE book (one of the Using... series) which I have historically found to be the best reference. Poor performance, Microsoft!"
1,The Should be Stumble and fall.,"This Book is not at all like all the others in the Step by Step Series and I wish I had put my money in to another book. OK I'm a novice but as a novice in Visual Basic for Applications I need to build some confidence in what I'm doing. With this in mind; You should be able to enter the code from the book and it should work. The code from the CD that comes with the books works well but there's nothing like working with a book to enter the code Step by Step just to find the code won't work. I've got 4 of the Step by step Series and this one is a flop and As for the name, it should be Stumble and fall."
3,Disappointing...,"I was hoping to find an alternative to Patterson et al.'s ""Computer Organization and Design"" -- mainly to get away from their constant and not-very-subtle ""MIPS is better than x86"" diatribe.This book loses one star for bad editing.It loses another star for being (in places) just plain wrong about details. The authors seem to do fine with ""big picture"" generalizations, but when it comes to the particulars -- watch out! This problem seems most obvious when they try to talk about the features of real-world CPUs, such as the x86 family. For example, they made a couple statements about Pentium memory management that left me wondering if they had ever read the Intel documentation. In general, their real-world examples seemed to be something that they stuck into the book in order to make it ""more relevant.""So, I guess it's back to Patterson, et al."
3,Heady aroma,Quality product from Avon. Amber notes are strong. Nice winter fragrance I was looking for something more upbeat and clean smelling. This is more exotic. That is the down side of buying a fragrance before you can smell it. Otherwise a nice product.
5,Inspiration from Bride of the Wind,"I may be too generous with the star-rating, but this is merely personal. I have been a Mahler devotee for so long and know the music very well. I have read several books on the Life and Times of the Mahlers and have visited Vienna many times. I know the art of Moll, Klimt and Kokoscka from repeated visits to the galleries housing them. So, to see the characters portrayed on screen somehow humanised them for me and inspired me to reread, to re-listen and to now concentrate my studies on Alma Mahler.Whilst I agree that the film may not be 'unforgettable' it will touch the hearts of the lovers of Vienna, music, art and even the coffee houses as it did mine. I am so happy to be the owner of this DVD. What I do miss, perhaps, are some 'the making of...'scenes, but no matter. If your heart is in the right place and you love music, go for it. The appearance of Rene Fleming singing an Alma Mahler composition was just superb!"
3,"Good movie, unjustly judged by critics","Bride of the Wind as far as I am aware, had no cinema release after being viciously savaged by critics (see 'Rotten Tomatoes'). As well as my DVD copy, I was fortunate to attend a cinema screening presented by Director Bruce Beresford and to briefly discuss the movie afterwards with him. I said that I found the film to be a 'quite OK' biopic and was surprised at the critics' treatment. I thought a slow release night gather speed via word of mouth, but the response was that no distributor would take the risk. I consider that the critics are wrong."
2,average success,"Folks, i wanted this movie to work. The austrian art scene of that era was very interesting, and fireworks should have sparked.I'm not sure if it was the screenplay or the editing which failed here. Period pieces can succeed when executed well (i.e. Merchant/Ivory productions) and being helmed with a firm director's hand. Alas, the film only succeed in its parts and not as a whole.Regardless, its always good to see Jonathan Pryce, and the Perez character seemed to walk in from a far more interesting production going on somewhere else down the street."
2,"Sorry, but the reviewers were right!","Many Amazon reviewers seem determined to rescue this film from the ""savage"" reviewers. Sadly, though, the reviewers were mostly right. At times the film can look quite well. But the script is so banal that it invites parody. And as Alma, a woman who fascinated a series of the greatest artistic figures of her time (and by no means only the three that she married), Beresford cast an Aussie ""girl next door"" who was pretty enough but projected not an ounce of charisma. Perhaps the best spirit in which to watch this film is as a case study in how an experienced and frequently-successful director was able to get so many different things wrong in a single project."
5,Please Re-Print This Book!!!!!!,"I purchased this book in 1997 for my first born. It was and is along with Goodnight Moon the most memorable book/s of his babyhood. I will always cherish the way he would laugh at the pictures and say the words before I would, having memorized every page. He remembered the next page and would try to say it before I turned the page. He is now 9, an amazing and avid reader, a true lover of books. I think that love for books began early and Ba Ba Ha Ha started it all. I have difficulty giving up books, yet have surrendered most of our cherished board books to friends with younger children. I will never part with this book as it truly evokes the most wonderful and cherished memories. Please, Please publishers consider reprinting this book!"
5,Our favorite first book,"The bold black and white faces in this charming book held our daughter's attention when she was two months old, and she still loves it now that she's two years old because she can ""read"" it back to us. Also, the back cover serves as a matching game because each of the faces appear twice. None of the other baby board books that we used have the lasting appeal of Ba Ba Ha Ha. This is a great book."
2,floppy case,"This bell case is floppy, not as firm as I thought it would be (to protect the bells from getting dented and such). If I had actually held the case in my hands before purchasing I would not have bought it."
3,Spiderman boxing gloves and punching bag,The bag itself is too lightweight. Needs to be heavier so that when my 4 year old hits it it doesn't go up to the ceiling! Thinking of putting some sand in it.
3,Pfaltzgraff is Not Its Former Quality,"I purchased two of these bowls to match the place settings. Like them, the bowls were cheaply made and of inferior quality. Pfaltzgraff was formerly known for its quality dinnerware, but like so many other companies, their product is now made in China and is cheaply done. Had I not gotten such a great price and outstanding service from Amazon, I would have rated this as one star."
5,This is an Amazing Book!,"I found this book, The Story of Zahra, amazing. I never even figured out what the end would be until I reached it. Then I had to ask, how could I be so dumb! I read this book in a matter of hours and was totally engrossed in the story. It really highlights the psychological life of a Muslim woman in Lebanon and how her behavior affects others. I disagree with the reviewer who believes that Zahra has a ""psychological disorder."" I think that she is a normal woman forced by convention and an oppressive life into behaviors she would never engage in if she was permitted more freedom and an ounce of respect. Zahra is never a person with self-determination but owned and controlled by others. She is eventually treated as a mere comodity."
2,A Book That Fails to Live Up to Its Story,"The Story of Zahra is a book that could have been great but ends up being a mishmash of cliches and stereotypes. Not only does it not accurately portray Lebanon or its history, it also incorporates most of the Orientalist stereotypes about Arabs and Arab culture.The character Zahra is not a sympathetic or even empathetic character and is reduced to being a very one-dimensional victim. She is a very pale shadow of the main characters of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Siri Hustvedts's The Blindfold. Zahra's monolgues are badly written and reminscent of a teenagers diary ramblings. None of the other characters have any dimension, being flat caricatures.The ending of the novel is quite shocking and powerful, had the author focused more on bringing the rest of the novel up to the level of the ending, it would have been much better."
2,Muddled novel about Lebanon...,"Hanan Al-Shyakh's ""Story of Zahra"" is a bit muddled, and tries to be a feminist book, but it only manages to make Zahra look like a perpetual victim in an misogynist part of the world. She flees her domineering, nasty father in Lebanon from her uncle that is conflicted about his feelings for his niece. Then to escape her uncle, she marries a man whom she'll never love. Then she flees to a war-torn Beiruit, and falls in love with a sniper. Love, violence and death then ensue. Frankly, I don't see why Arab nations had any fuss over this; it's not good enough to be subversive enough."
1,It's a lie!,"I hated this book!It was like a big lie. Nothing of what she mentioned really happened. I am Lebanese and I know all about Arab culture. This lousy book gives a very wrong impression about Arab culture, it is infact nothing of what she mentioned.Even in war time, when Lebanon was devided into Sharkiyyeh(Eastern part where all the Christians lived) and Gharbiyyeh( Western part where all the Muslims lived)it was never like what she wrote about. Even if it were to happen, it would happen to one in a million. I wonder why she got so much attention over a lame book. To me it was more like a lousy re-write of an American novel. Western people who read this book PLEASE don't beleive it! Elle doit faire attention a ce qu'elle ecrit."
4,cannoli tubes,"Have been using old bamboo tubes for last 25 years. They were starting to fall apart and every year had to throw a few more out. Searched for days and days to find new bamboo tubes with no luck. Bought a single pack of these to give then a try.....and it turns out they work just as good if not better then the bamboo ones. I usually make about 200-300 cannoli's around the holidays and these tubes are perfect. Only drawback is they are a little longer then i prefer. Cannot fit more then 3 or 4 in standard deep fryer. So when you are making a couple hundred at a time its makes for a lot of extra time deep frying. I actually took a hack saw and cut about 1.5"" off each one and it allowed me to get 1-2 more in the deep fryer at a time."
5,Great quality,This item is of greater quality than the cheaper versions of cannoli forms. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would use them often. I only which they would come on a bigger quantity (not only 4) but I guess you can always buy a second package
4,THIS CLEP REVIEW IS PRETTY GOOD,"I bought the principles of management clep review booklet about 3-4 weeks ago. THIS is the only peiece of material I used to study for the clep exam. Its 6 chapters, and they all range from 8 to 12 pages long, so its not a long tedius read. Needless to say, I read about a chapter or two a week, did the review test at the end of each chapter, and did a complete review the day before the test. WITH THIS PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT CLEP REVIEW, I was successfully able to pass the clep exam with a 58. The highest you can get is a 80. The test was pretty decent, but I have to admit there are some questions on there that will have you scratching your head because the review guide didin't mention it. Regardless, this review guide is good enough leave the exam with a passing score. CHEERS!"
2,I'm going against the crowd here!,"I used this book for preparation on the CLEP test. In addition to this book I listened to an OLD 6 part audio book series with an overview of the MBA cirriculum. I LITERALLY read this book SIX times, YES SIX, to be sure that I would pass the test. I passed but not by flying colors! This book is OK, but I would STRONGLY recommend supplementing it with additional material. I would honestly say that the information in this book helped on approximately 40-50% of the test. There were things on the test that I just had to guess at because they sure were not in THIS book."
4,Decent book to study for the Clep Test,"I studied for the Clep Exam in five days and passed. There were a few questions on the actual test that was found in the test section of this book, and I wish that all tests could be passed this easily. I encourage all test takers to memorize this book from front to back."
4,Great Study Guide.,"I was pressured by time because the classes I'm taking for the upper division were getting full quickly, so I studied for nearly two weeks and I passed!The guide is understandable, condensed and precise, no fillers or unnecessary material you won't need for the test. six chapters covers almost all!The only downside I experienced is that, even almost everything is covered there were a few questions in the test I wasn't sure it was part of the material. But I finished the test in less than 50 minutes! not so bad for a two weeks study.Make sure you memorize the names and their correlation with the theories/history/definitions.In overall, my advice for taking the test would be, make sure you completely comprehend the material, common sense is definitely a big plus."
4,This Little book is perfect for passing the test!,Read this thin little book and passed the test.'nuff said!
3,a non-management /business student,"for those of you who are not management/business students I would suggest using this book along with another referrence. I just took the clep and although I came in the 71st percentile I don't give this book all the credit-a lot of common sence on the exam. However, I believe only about 30% of the context from the exam was noted to be in the review book. good luck to all."
3,BE CAREFUL !!!!,"Though this book is better than most CLEP reviews, it is still not above 80%. Be sure to study the review guide completely and time the practice exams. Depending on the score you need for credit from your institution, you may need every point this book can get you."
2,somewhat satisfied,"The material in the book was very good. However, the practice tests were nothing like the real exam. The exam did not have any ""all of the above"", or ""none of the above"", options in any of the 100 questions, yet one in every five practice question had that option."
3,Great book.... except for the ending,I liked this book in general. It has very good and vivid descriptions and if you are a christian who has a liking for fantasy type books than I would certainly recommend this one.My only complaint is that the book literally has a one page ending. There is nothing there to tell what happened to any of the characters except for the main character. This is my only complaint of the book. The actual journey of the character and the story line is magnificent in my opinion. I would definately recommend it.
1,Andrew,"This review is more about presentation as it is product. When viewing the product it appears (and I certainly thought) that I was purchasing a sprayer/boom unit. There is a picture of a sprayer and boom and the description is somewhat deceiving. My purchase arrived last night and I was blown away that it only included the boom (no spraying unit). I had looked at a very simular product at Agri Supply that included the entire unit. I have not tried the boom out yet as I guess I will have to buy a sprayer unit for it to work. I have ordered many things thru Amazon and have always been 100 percent satisfied. This is very upsetting. I feel like the product was not properly represented. When I read (and see) a 10 foot SPRAYER AND BOOM and the description says 10-foot hinged sprayer boom, I thought that was what I was getting."
3,Could b better,It was OK but could be better for a movie made when it was made. I will hang on to it but I will probably not watch it again.
2,Not so timeless,"Outdated information, old-fashioned painting techniques and poorly colored pictures abound in this 1987 book. Watercolor paints, brushes and techniques have changed and improved so much since this book was written. I have found several contemporary artist's books to be much more helpful in developing my skills. Don't buy this book if you are a growing watercolor artist."
5,excellent for any level,"I purchased this book for my father, who is a graduate of the Cleveland Institute of Art and a watercolorist for many years. He is always looking for techniques to improve his craft. He saw this book in the library and after renewing it several times, I decided to buy him his own. He raves about it and has recommended it to others who are novices. I also purchased Tony Couch's two videos, as well, and those are excellent sources, and the value there is that the technique is demonstrated. My father prizes both the books and the videos. I am NOT talented in art, but am compelled to try watercolor after viewing the tapes."
1,Fishing Rod Broken During Shipping,"Amazon failed to ship the fishing rod in a shipping tube. When I received it, the cardboard box was bent like an archery bow. The rod inside was broken. I informed Amazon and they sent me a replacement. It also came in a cardboard box and this rod was broken just like the first one. I returned both rods and Amazon credited my account. Sadly, the credit was only for the price of the rod. I had to pay for Amazon's failure to ship the rods properly. Their email system did not allow me to respond to this ripoff."
3,Biography of Theodore van Karman - famous fluid dynamicist.,"If you are intersted in the history of technology then this book would interest you. Fluid mechanics, turbulence and early flight are covered; with refernces to many early theoreticians such as Prandtl and Blasius."
3,Party Background,"I bought this CD for a Jewish Themed birthday party, and I must say that it definately added a certain flair to the celebrations. Not the best I've ever heard, but fun enough for background party music."
4,Good Case,"Good Case, but it could have been better if there were better facilities to execute the controls on the front of the recorder without removing from the case."
4,Fits Perfect,This is a good case for the recorder except I wish it had some way to fasten it to a belt or waistband. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
5,"Solid, secure case","This is a nice, handy little carrying case for the Olympus WS-300M 256 MB Digital Voice Recorder. I liked the secure fit of this case. Too bad the DVR is such a poor product. I ultimately returned the WS-300M, rendering this carrying case unusable and so returned it. If only Olympus would made such nicely fitting cases for its other models!"
5,Go The Distance With This One,"There are a zillion Michael Bolton Hits Collections out there more or less echoing the track listing from Greatest Hits 1985 - 1995.So if you are looking for something more comprehensive, The Essential Michael Bolton is the answer. It borrows heavily from his multi-platinum efforts such as Soul Provider, Time, Love And Tenderness, Timeless The Classics and Greatest Hits 1985 - 1995.Bolton with his Herculean looks, body and voice carries the high notes with plenty of emotion in ballads like Go The Distance and Nessun Dorma.I really love the cover shot. It is straight out of British GQ. The font used here is also more stylish unlike the basic design for the US version. Unfortunately, there are no write ups in the linear notes detailing Bolton's career from his early days till present. Still with 36 songs, The Essential Michael Bolton is a sure thing."
2,"Um, What??","Now, I like Michael, don't get me wrong. The whole Essential thing?? That doesn't work for me. I must have really sensitive equipment because to me, the mastering is not what it could be and as far as the Essential series goes, this is not the only entry in the series that needs to be looked at. Barry Manilow, Dolly Parton, Neil Diamond, Alabama, and Ronnie Milsap should be listened to again and the mastering Engineer reproached for disinterest in the final results of what should be fine compilations highlighting highs in the various artists careers. No, these sets frustrate me and leave me wanting to investigate better compilations."
2,VHS Tape,Not what I needed. The product performed as advertised and was a quality product. I am not very happy with this purchase.
1,Substandard Treatment of Kierkegaard,"It is rather disappointing that professor Gardiner, who otherwise seems himself to be an astute and conscientious writer, so patently overlooks the essential character of Kierkegaard and Kierkegaard's struggle to exist in the ""how"" (not the ""what"") of the truth. Sadly, Gardiner seems to fall victim of becoming almost doctrinaire(!) about Kierkegaard -- quite an irony, esp. considering that SK anticipated such reconstructions by pedantic professors after he was long dead.I do NOT recommend this book, for many reasons, but esp. since it vainly attempts to consider SK as a mere thinker, using the spurious canons of rational acceptability all too common among Anglophone philosophes who merely play with the truth -- and never dare to actually venture out and live it in their lives.On the other hand, if you want to read Gardiner -- for Gardiner's sake -- and you wish to refine the game of reconstruction and dour pedantism, buy the book, by all means..."
2,An Introduction for...?,"I think that it is important for this series of short introductions to decide who it is they are catered for. It seems to me that many of the writers are more academic than is probably necessary and while this doesn't diminish the information presented, it does stifle the life and personality of the subject matter. It appears that the demands of academic rigour and its associated authority are a lot more deeply entrenched than I would have thought."
5,"Buy this CD! You're kids won't stop singing, mine haven't!!","What a delightful surprise to play this CD for the first time. My kids were driving us crazy as we drove them to their grandparents for our Easter visit. When I tell you they stopped their arguing midway through the first song and started singing along to this music, you would not have believed it. In fact we all started signing along, and played this CD the entire 3 hours it took to get to North Carolina. I don't know who you are E. L. Pace, but your music is exciting, peaceful and just plain wonderful. We'll be buying the companion CD, Secret Anadarko, which we've just found on your website. God bless you, and please keep making this delightful music. PS My little boy hasn't quite mastered tying his shoelaces, but at least now he has something to sing along the way :)"
3,It seems like it should work better!,"I was hoping that this tool would have eliminated the dull knife problem that one often gets, and I did not want to keep running my knives through the electric sharpener. I purchased this sharpener after watching it demonstrated on a cooking show. Although the sharpener is well build, as hard as I try it still doesn't seem to sharpen the blade as advertised, or as an electric sharpener does."
5,Cool Italian Soul,"Neri per Caso created a CD just as strong and delightful as their past ones. The first two tracks are excellent, and all the others are great as well. My only problem was the CD's length, around 40 minutes total. But regardless it is well worth the money! While the songs themselves will end, you will find yourselves humming the tunes, even trying to sing along in Italian! Catchy, uplifting, beautiful, this CD is a must buy for those who just love a cappella."
2,Not too hot,"As a health care professional, I hate HMO's but love HMO-thrillers. Well, ""The Oath"" is low on my list. In fact, after a while, I just skimmed it. The writing was poor and I, for one, wasn't drawn in the the ""old favorite characters"" who I felt detracted from the plot action. Don't waste your time."
3,Just a Maybe,"Lescroart's plots are ingenious and well researched, but his choice of words reminds me of B-novel vocabulary. It's part of the tough-guy routine, I guess. For instance, look at these examples: ""They didn't talk about it--they were guys afterall--."" ""After the macho need to demonstrate their awesome strength...""And his sentences are so full of slang that one wonders if he has a good vocabulary. If some of his sentences were submitted in a creative writing class, the writer would be told to try again....or give up.Della"
2,"Mediocre, Predictable","This was hardly a mystery since the guilty person was clear from the outset due to the obviously dislikable portrayal. Overall another hackneyed heroic doctor vs evil health insurance corp story. Things are hardly that simple, and this mess with only occasional readable patches is a mediocre, forgettable work."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"As a huge fan of Dismas Hardy, I found myself a bit let down by this latest work. There is none of the courtroom drama, and Dismas keeps telling himself he should spend more time with his family, but can't seem to get it together. There is a cheap trick at the end to mislead the reader. Lescroart does a better job writing about law than medicine--the forensic details are inaccurate, the mode of death described would not be detectable on autopsy."
2,Not his best,"I have read all of Lescroart's Dismas Hardy novels and this one is not up to his usual standards. The plot is weak and barely believable. The details of the interactions of the corporate leadership of the HMO and the physicians has no basis in reality. The assignments of the nursing employees and physicians to various departments of the hospital is not realistic - a highly trained nurse would not rotate his or her assignments in and out of an ICU nor would a physician spend time in an outpatient clinic, emergency room, operating room and ICU. These persons are too highly trained to work in several different areas each of which demands a high level of expertise and training. The conclusion likewise is almost an afterthought that would not occur in real life.I have enjoyed Lescroart's other works. He should stick with those areas of which he has knowledge or do a better job of research before presenting his stories."
1,I take an oath not to listen to this reader again.,"I am currently listening to 'The Oath' (uabridged) on cassette. It's hard to tell much about the book because I concentrate so much on Robert Lawrence, the reader. I thought at first that things would get better, once Lawrence became familiar with the work. It's as if he is reading for the first time. He pauses when conversation does not warrant a pause, as if he were turning the page every couple of minutes, pauses, and continues reading. ('John walked into the other ... pause ... room') I am having a tough time getting through the book because I am not paying attention to the plot."
2,The person who developed this never actually tried it on someone with fine hair...,"This junk was so nasty in my hair. I have very fine, naturally blonde hair and I am weary of using a lot of product because they generally weigh my hair down, and since my hair is pretty light colored, you can immediately tell when products start making my hair oily. A friend recommended this to me, but she does NOT have fine hair, so I'm sure it worked ok for her. If I use a very light amount at the roots, it works decent, but not as well as other LESS EXPENSIVE products I have tried. Over all it left my hair sticky, oily, and weighed down. I much prefer Redken body full weightlifter."
5,They stopped selling this product. I didn't think anyone else would have it. Very happy i found it again.,IThis product does what it says. It leaves your hair thick without weighing hair downIt really is lightweight.
5,So sad this is being discontinued,I love this product. It is the perfect light weight hair spray. You don't feel it on your hair the next morning. But I am very sad that they are no longer going to make it. The company was bought out I believe.
2,Flavorless,"This is gross. It's flavorless, with a weird texture of beans and gritty tofu (I think?). I'm vegan, so trust me, I'm very forgiving on taste -- especially for something like chili. I made it edible by pouring some BBQ sauce and spaghetti sauce in it, but I won't be buying this again."
2,Flavorless,"I don't think I've ever had a more flavorless chili. I'm a fan of many Amy's products, but not this one."
1,Just a little too hot,"If I am not mistaken , I think it said mild chili, and this is not mild. It has jalapeno peppers in it and we're not used to such hot chili. The flavor is very good though and is nice and thick.Dorothy"
5,This face mask is outstanding.,This face mask is outstanding. works great to keep you warm and toasty while not fogging up my glasses. Looks very scary as well!
3,Read the Editor's Foreward!,"Started reading without reading the Editor's Foreward and became totally confused with interspersed chapters with 2 stories being told. Read the Foreward! But then I just could not get into the background story, and ended up just reading the Tomcat Murr story in every second chapter. This was quite charming... old fashioned of course, but worth reading"
1,junk,sent it back after I locked my trucks gas tank and it would not come off. Had to break it apart to do that. Thankfully the return was still acceptable.
1,This is not an original soundtrack!!!,"There are 23 tracks on this album by various hip-hop artist. The strange thing is that there are only four songs in the movie score (all by one artist). The other three are voice snippets from the film. This soundtrack is the purest form of a rip-off I have every seen. This is why I file a complaint with Amazon. com. With the conclusion being that they reimbursed for the purchase. THIS CD SHOULD NOT BE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC. The producer gets around this not being an Original Soundtrack by adding the snippets from the movie. Further evidence is on the CD label ""Music Inspired By"" A Pimp's Tale Sugar Valentine. With the jacket art work from the movie."
3,Didn't Like it too much,I understand the concept of the book but it didn't work with my son. He actually took the title literally so it actually backfired. I ended up giving the book away.
3,"ok, but nothing profound","Honestly, this book didn't have any profound ideas in it that helped me help my son cope with his separation anxiety. He didn't love the story, I think it made him feel worried and sad for the little bee. Contrary to what I expected, this book didn't have any new thoughts or approaches that I hadn't already thought of. More than anything, facilitating opportunities for my son to connect with other kids outside of school (play dates at our house or theirs) has made it progressively easier for him to go to school. Building friendships and helping him feel comfortable and connected was the key. Now he has friends that he is excited to see each morning and he races onto the play ground."
1,Coisa Mas Linda,"Purchased 06-05-11. Photo of DVD shows it to be Region 4. Item description indicates All Region. Upon Purchase, it was region 4, not playable on USA players. Just a heads up."
5,i am looking for this dvd,"i recently saw the documentary coisa mais linda on cable tv. it had spanish subtitles and it was most informative and really great to see. i wish to purchase a copy but amazon only has one copy with portuguese subtitles, no english or spanish subtitles are available. can someone provide info on where i can obtain this excellent documentary? thank you."
1,WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!,This is one of my favorite films but WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! the DVD I received from Amazon.com is in FRENCH ONLY and does NOT offer a sub-title track!!! Unless you speak French fluently DO NOT ORDER THIS EDITION!
1,I saw it in English on TV,"Rating is for DVD not movie as movie deserves 4.5 stars.I'm glad that you all pointed out that it was french only. What upsets me even more was that i seen most of it as a friend taped it from TV and it was in english, and done well enough that i thought it was an english movie. I only wish he hadn't taped over the end as i couldn't see it all."
4,subtitles and dubbed in english to boot...,"like most who have reviewed the film itself, i found the story compelling and a welcome addition/alternative to mr. gibson's ""passion."" for those of you reading previous reviews, it's important that you know this newest release DOES CONTAIN ENGLISH SUBTITLES. what's more, this version is also DUBBED IN ENGLISH, though i found the dubbed translation to be more forced than the subtitles. i recommend you see the movie first in the original french language with english subtitles. my only caveat in this recommendation is noting that THERE IS NO WIDESCREEN VERSION available. you will, unfortunately, be limited to a ""pan and scan"" approach that doesn't allow you to appreciate the full expanse of the original. but don't let that stop you...the story will still be as powerful."
3,No English Subtitles,"While I stand by my earlier review of the movie Jesus de Montreal, the DVD which just arrived is disappointing in having neither English subtitles or a dubbed English version. I have seen this movie with both so I know they exist but neither is on the DVD. It is still a beautiful movie but I'm afraid I miss some of the complexity of the dialogue (actually, most of it!)."
3,Thanks for the warning!,"Thanks for the warnings, everyone! I'm taking this off my wish-list. I liked this movie (saw an old taped version off TV once) but only know a little French. Certainly not enough to follow the film without subtitles. That's too bad because I was looking forward to seeing the movie again."
1,How disappointing...,"I agree with many other reviewers. I have been so looking forward to a re-release of this movie. I think it is the best ""Jesus-movie"" ever made so far. I even would have bought it on VHS.My French is ok, but I will only buy if the DVD offers at least English subtitles. I don't see, however, why there shouldn't be a complete English soundtrack since the English version of the movie was excellent also. --- I'll wait and watch."
2,You need more than just this product to wear your mp3 player on your arm,You also have to purchase the clear plastic case to attach your player to this armband.iAUDIO Carrying Case Clear for U3
1,Does not work with iAudio 9,And I seriously doubt it works with many other COWON products. I have both the plastic case and the carrying case for the iaudio 9. The only way that either could work with the armband is if the plastic flap of the armband could be threaded over the back of the case. This is not possible with either case. The Gee Bee armband for iaudio 9 works so-so.
5,excellent work from a modern master,"This is a double cd. Ancient future is a cd of solo piano recently recorded. Blue is a reissue, also solo piano. There aren't too many Randy Weston solo CDs, so this is a rare treat. Both CDs are good, and Blue, the older one, is excellent. He is very original, kind of a cross between Monk and Abdullah Ibrahim is the only way to describe his style. He is a major modern songwriter too. ""The mystery of Love"" is just so beautiful."
2,Not a good book,"I was very disapointed with this book. It seems the author is very fond of talking, but forgets to make conclusions, and is essentially going nowhere. There is no ""red line"" throughout the book.But let me be more specific. My problems with this book are :1 : The author spends about 70% of the book talking about the sorroundings of Rennes-le-Chateau, telling us about lots of small villages and paths. But there is no map in the book!!!This makes it impossible to follow the author unless you actually live in the area.2 : The model mentioned in the title only occupies the last 30 pages. This is a shame, because it seems that this is where the author has some superior knowledge.3 : There is a lack of structure in the book. It seems like a conversation has been written in form of a book.My conclusion(!!) : Buy this if you own all other books on Rennes-le-Chateau. It has some speciel knowledge. But otherwise avoid it."
4,"Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream, 16-Ounce","I strongly recommend this product to who ever is a sufferer from chronic dry, sensitive skin (like I'm). I have found that no moisturizing creams have ever come close to as Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has. This is the only cream that I have found to improve my dry itchy skin (especially applied after a shower). I have found that even the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion has not even come close to the Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream. I noticed that Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion had actually made me break out from some ingredient that reacted harshly to my dry sensitive skin. If this sounds like you give Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream a try."
5,"Great for dry, sensitive skin","I have tried tons and tons of different moisturizers. I don't even want to know all the money I have spent on products. I have sensitive skin and my legs get irritated from shaving. I also dont like to wear really heavy lotions that leave me feeling sticky. After basically using lotions a few times and then going on to the next one, I decided to try this. I heard so many good things about it. It has a really nice thick consistency, which scared me at first. But it wasn't heavy and didnt leave my skin feeling sticky, at all! It left it soothed and smooth feeling. I just started using it under my eyes instead of my expensive under eye cream, and I swear it's doing a better job! This stuff will also last you a long time. No more switching around and throwing 1/2 used jars away anymore! I found a keeper."
3,An imagination that never stops,"Although not as good as ERB's John Carter, Warlord of Mars series, this book is very imaginative and entertaining. I am amazed at how ERB takes the science of the time and extrapolates onto other planets."
4,Keeping Firefly alive,Good reading material for a fresh outlook on a series that should still be in existance.
4,Lots of odd facts and perceptions.,"This is the ""Reality TV show"" of the book world about Firefly. It has helped me appreciate the show, as well as the evolution of ideas in Hollywood...and how stupidazz executives that have zero clue can screw up a really good thing.A 95% ""must have"" for any Firefly/Serenity/Joss fan."
4,A must have for any Firefly fan.,"I thought it was a great read, although there was one feminazi author in there ranting off about inequality of the sexes in the Firefly 'verse that had me seething. Apart from that one Big Fat Crapola, I liked the rest of the essays. Jewel's recollections was particularly pleasing, and worth the price of the book alone. The Firefly Chinese glossary in the back comes in handy when watching re-watching the episodes. And the book has really given me a new insight as to why I like Firefly. It pointed out some things in the series that make me go, ""huh, ok, that's why I liked that ___"". A must have for any Firefly fan."
5,Extremely shiny!,"I just completed the book and I was thoroughly impressed. The commentary on this wonderful, short-lived television series was insightful (from both critical and complimenting views) and interesting. It is interesting to see the varied individuals that Miss Espenson gathered to make comment on a series that should have gone on and on for at least 6 or 7 seasons. The book is rife with enthusiasm and anticipation for the new movie to be released on September 30, 2005! I also loved Jewel Staite's (Kaylee in the Firefly series) insightful commentary on her favorite episodes and behind-the-scenes stories.Overall, I bestowed a 5 star rating because of the fact that you can read this book in chunks (each chapter is 7-10 pages or so), and that each chunk has a life of its own and gives insight into the mainstream authors and industry professionals that wrote them.Highly recommended."
3,"Uneven, but valuable collection","I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that this collection was a mish-mash. It falls uncomfortably between the scholarly and the fan-oriented. But I found much worthwhile and enjoyable writing alongside less-useful commentary. If we set aside papers where the theory overwhelms the material such as in ""Whores and Goddesses"" and ones that are rather pointless such as ""Firefly vs. The Tick"" and not hugely funny satires such as ""Mirror/Mirror"" and ""The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of Firefly"" we have a slim volume including reference materials on the Mandarin used in the series, well-argued commentary on the mixing of genres (""Just Shove Him in the Engine, or The Role of Chivalry in Firefly"") and some very insightful commentary on the characters (""More Than a Marriage of Convenience""), on the culture (""Asian Objects in Space"") and the setting (""Star Truck"").So, an indispensable, though not entirely satisfactory, collection."
3,Pedestrian Writing Undermines Essay Collection,"With one or two exceptions, I was disappointed in these essays, as they unfortunately underlined what I dislike about so much genre writing: that it lacks individual style and is merely tailored to sell books to a particular group of fans or for a particular label. I don't doubt that the contributors care deeply about ""Firefly,"" but their various points of view are no more gracefully written, and sometimes less so, than those of a thousand equally intelligent and passionate viewers posting on the internet. The first essay did bring an interesting, professional perspective to an area I had responded to with more instinctive appreciation than knowledge, but there just wasn't enough in the collection to make me feel it was a ""keeper,"" and so I have already passed it along to my local library, where others may enjoy it more than I did."
4,One Browncoat's opinion....,"Some interesting perspectives, It's always good to view somthing through another's idealogical glasses. (even if decidedly rose colored!)A must for obsessed Browncoat's like myself."
1,Amazing how far you can get ripping off someone else.,A scholarly work on the content of Firefly? Amazing how far you can get from just ripping off with very few minor changes the concepts behind an anime called Outlaw Star.
1,Authors should be skeptics,"I will only rate this book based on the author's experiences in a place I have known intimately all of my adult life: Iquitos, Peru. Shah, an experienced traveller, was completely taken in by one of the most utterly transparent charlatans in Iquitos. The gringo ex-pat scene there is not unlike other tropical spots, and one would think the author might be aware of the tall-tale spinning, incompetent types he was likely to encounter. Not so, apparently! But on behalf of all who know the area, a hearty thanks to the author for providing us with hours of belly laughs! Poor fellow really got taken for a ride. If his fact checking on other portions of the book was similar, I can only say, ""reader beware!"""
2,Draft for British sitcom,"Allegedly experienced writer and traveler expects us to believe he was a dunce taken in by expensive, unnecessary equipment and an unscrupulous first inline of potential guides; and then, when he gets to the competent, interesting guide and the other (potentially good stuff), gives us little about the interesting people and places because he's too busy letting us know he's a kind of wimpy and pretty much ineffective and dependent inquirer into the mystery he went after."
5,A long-overdue parenting guide,"I wish that this book had been available when my children were born. It's all so natural and sensible, but somewhere along the way we lost it - snuggling, breast-feeding, sleeping with and thoroughly enjoying a vital, intense connection with our young. Attachment parented children are certain to become secure, centered, happy adults. Buy it and do it!"
2,fairly preachy,"main point of book is to breastfeed as over half of it dwells on that. also, references are often repeated as they are provided at end of eacfh heading. interesting read but no mysteries solved..."
5,The best parenting book I've ever read,"If you're not sure you really understand what Attachment Parenting *is*, this is the book for you. It's well-written, well-organized and full of both practical and thoughtful information. It's also very hard-hitting. The chapter on why sleep-training methods are a bad idea really made me re-think some of my previous views. I also like the book because the author doesn't ""guilt"" anybody. She says that attachment parenting can take lots of forms in different families. As a working mother, I loved the chapter on how to integrate attachment parenting into a working parent's life. This was overall the best parenting book I've ever read."
2,Intolerant tone turned me off,"I was really interested in attachment parenting, which is why I picked up this book. But even as someone with a really open mind, I came away feeling brow beaten and my child isn't even born yet! I mean, am I really such a bad parent if I don't planning on nursing my son till age five?I agree with previous reviewers that the authors frequently refer to Dr. Sears's books and you should do the same. Dr. Sears is much more balanced and gentle. 'The Baby Book' is thorough and well worth the money.The only reason to get this book is the great list of resources (links to stores, interest groups and forums) at the end of each chapter."
1,Did not add to my knowledge in any way,"I found this book to be really redundant, dogmatic and frankly, insulting in its lack of new information. It just did not contribute any knowledge beyond the other books that are widely available, and that are better-written. Most of the information in the book is a rehash of stuff from Dr. William Sears' books (which I love) and from Our Babies Ourselve, by Meredith Small (another great book!). Please check out those much more interesting and informative works instead of this."
1,WTF???,"I have never seen an author review their own book. Scroll on down. Has this woman no shame? There are also a ton of ""a reader"" reviews that sound very very similiar. Did she log on under different screen names and give her own book a ton of positive reviews? Did she have her family do it (anonymously so it wouldn't be TOO obvious....) Like I said..>WTF?"
2,"Good subject matter, but preachy and lacking originality","I really wanted to like this book. I was already an attachment parent before reading the book, and hoped it would be a good book for me to recommend to new mothers (and maybe even learn something new myself). But while I already had read a lot of attachment parenting literature and didn't expect to learn many new things, almost everything in the book was a rehash of materials already published by Dr. Sears, La Leche League, and others. In addition, I found it to be so preachy and judgmental that it was a turn off. As someone already converted to attachment parenting, if I found it too preachy, I definitely wouldn't want to recommend it to a skeptic. I'm giving it two stars just because I'm happy to have more books on the market about the subject, but this is not among the best."
2,Borrow this book from the library,"This book serves as a good reference for products and other books related for attachment parenting. There is so much more to attachment parenting than this book presents. If you borrow this book from the library you can read it in an afternoon. At the end of each chapter is a list of other references. Attachment parenting is so much more than just breastfeeding, co-sleeping and baby wearing. This book is fine but not exhaustive on the subject. Dr. Sears' books are the ones to buy and keep for day to day referral."
4,"Best book for a tired, anxious parent. I loved it.",I really wish I had had this book to read while I was still pregnant. It answers so many questions that I had that no other book seemed to address. And it approaches childcare very realistically. It's the only parenting book I've seen that tells you honestly how often a new baby will want to nurse. Mine wanted to eat every hour and I was totally unprepared because other books said he would go two to four hours between each nursing session. This book tells the truth. I also really appreciated the section on how to make sure that you are safe when you sleep with your baby. It gives many practical tips for creating different ways to get more sleep as a new parent. My husband liked the book because it doesn't leave fathers out. My only suggestion would have been to make the book a bit shorter.
5,"Delivers what it promises: loving, appropriate childrearing.","Granju and Kennedy objectively explore the needs of infants and children in a thought-provoking, systematic book. As a mother of two, I found their words at the very least interesting, at best truly inspiring. I recommend their book to any parent of young children."
2,Disappointing,"Was hoping for an in-depth book, but subject matter was glossed-over. Not enough substance."
2,Attachment Parenting:Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Youn,I was not at all impressed with this book. Much of what I read I had already learned for Dr. Sears' Baby Book. The rest of it seems hinged around breastfeeding. I was very dissapointed with the whole thing. I feel I wasted money I could have used to by a toy for my child.
3,This book would greatly improve...,"if the author would simply state that there is no reason to have a newborn circumcised instead of all this feel-goody mumbo about ""well if you decide to have it done..."" Infant circumcision is wrong. Amputating normal and healthy tissue from a newborn baby is just plain wrong."
1,"This book insults ""thinking"" mothers and fathers","I consider myself an ""attachment parent"" - my son is exclusively breastfed, he sleeps in the Arm's Reach cosleeper and I carry him whenever I can. And, believe me, I love Dr. Sears as much as the next mom. But I found this book to be nothing more than propaganda for Dr. Sears. On top of that, the author makes you feel guilty and stupid if you don't follow her ideas to the T. This book left me feeling like my son would be scarred for life unless I did exactly what it says. Sorry, but parents and children are more complicated than that, and I prefer to think for myself.If you want to know more about attachment parenting, skip this patronizing and insulting book and go straight to something from the Sears library."
1,"How about ""Katie Granju's Parenting"" for the title!","Don't buy this book, please don't. You will only find it filled with the writer's personal bias more so than facts. No, a crib is not a baby cage, and buying a stroller is not a crime (you can't use a sling forever); and while I am a breastfeeding mother and strongly believe in the benefits of breastfeeding, I wouldn't allow myself to develop this attitude that would make other mothers believe formula manufacturers have an evil corporate greed based vendetta to rid the world of breastfeeding mothers. There are many other books you can buy on natural parenting and bonding with your baby that aren't filled with this high level of misinformation."
1,does not fit an older parent,Well I must say this book is written by a very narrow minded MAN.I am an older mom (52)- I cannot breastfeed or wear the twins in a sling ( for fear of breaking my back). We need rules to come from us the adults- not what the babies want. There is a bedtime as well as mealtimes. We keep a schedule and use bottles. The twins are thriving- 8 months old now.These babies are attached to us and we use a live in caregiver too.
3,"This is Dr. Sears ""lite""","If you don't have time to read ""The Baby Book"" or other attachment parenting books by Dr. William Sears, this is a good synopsis of his basic philosophy. I recommend Dr. Sears' books if you have the time to read them, because they are much more thorough, and come straight from the source."
3,Excellent book for the hardcore AP parent,"It seems like it offers a lot of ideas on how to deal with skepticism and how to use AP vs. other parenting ideals but I feel like there is not enough information on how to continue to foster the AP relationship after babyhood. Also, some of the ideas are impractical for anyone other than a stay-at home parent. It would be nice to read an AP book that has a more realistic look at today's mainstream and how to incorporate these philosophies accordingly."
3,less than impressed,"i thought the dial would spin as a timer, but it did not.also the clasp on the band arrived scratched.nice item, but maybe not worth the price."
3,"Without buying it, still the chance to get to know yourself.","I gave it 3 stars, because to be honest I haven't read it, but I do know his style is (if you like/ can handle it) very mind opening (if that's how I can put it?), because I got his first book and that there is an online version/ workbook on Oprah's [website]... of Self Matters. So spend your money on something else and still get to know your authentic self, I know I will! (BTW sorry but my native language isn't English)"
1,The funniest American comedian! :D,I never get serious reading his book or seeing his show on tv. This guy is nothing but 'pure hype'. You don't need to get a Phd in Psychology to do his job. His show should be in Comedy Central though.
2,endless repetition - could've been cut in half,"The exercises and tests in the book were of some help, they helped me realize a few things about my life, myself and my current behavior. However, I found it very repetitive and too obvious, at times. It's extremely simplified, almost so much that it gives the impression of having been ""dumbed down"" for the general public to grasp. The book could've used more depth and elaboration, in my opinion. I felt that most things he suggested were behaviors I already practiced on a day to day basis. I couldn't relate much to it, although it made some good points and reaffirmed me in my ways."
3,time consuming,I haven't finished the book so I probably shouldn't write a review yet. But i find this slow reading with exercises that are too fundamental and time consuming. I get bored reading how he knows what I feel cause he's felt it. I think there are much better books on the subject. Books that make you serach yourself and come to conclusions.
4,This book will change your life !!!!,"M. D. Gray, author of ""Smilosophy: Getting More Smileage Out of Life gives this book a definite thumbs up. This is a book that will allow readers to examine their own life and then gives specific directions to make life what a person wants and desires it to be. Phillip McGraw hits home where everyone lives. Life is much too short to have a life that has been patterned by others rather than our own selves. McGraw gives step by step instructions on how a person can make their lives truly fulfilled and happy.A must have book for all."
1,More Psychobable,"I did not like this book at all, and I have read more self-help books than I can count. Although I agree that enless examination of the past is not all that useful I also have a hard time believing that 10 events in your life have defined who you are. I rapidly became tired of the so-called ""in your face"" style, and found his approach to be just as couched in ""psychobable"" as any other book of this type I have read. I think his approach is overated and this volume has convinced me to give up this type of self-help book forever! Get out there, live your life outloud, and stop waiting for someone like Phil McGraw to make your life what you want it to be."
3,Positive and Interesting,"Overall, I don't think this was really what I was looking for personally but this was still an easy set of tapes to listen to. Dr. McGraw is an excellent speaker and kind of funny at times. It's worth the money if you are looking for positive thoughts on changing your life or changing habits in your life. Give it a try!"
4,Getting There,"Haven't finished the book yet because unlike almost every other self-help book I've ever seen, this one requires a lot of hard work -- and that's the only way to get results.I just wanted to note that the scoring for the exercises on Appendix A and B were accidentally left out of the first edition. They are:AS: 8 points, A: 4 pts, DS: 2 pts, D: 1 pt"
2,Could have been better,"I had to stop reading. I found some of his anecdotes to be unrelated to his points and too wordy. It took half the book to say what could have been summed up in the first chapter or two. The search for defining moments became drudgery and a tedious task. You need an inordinate amount of time to dig up your past and follow his steps.Unfortunately,I was turned off by the assignments, the most important part. Also, he could have been more specific with the details about the defining moments and five pivotal people. That info was a bit vague. To me, it was just like psych 101 only with more assignments! I walked away from the book with more problems that I began with."
4,Getting to Know Yourself,"Dr. Phil wrote this book for you if you are constantly trying to live up to others' expectations of you rather than to your authentic identity. If you are unsure of the person you really are, his exercises can help if you do them. He has you list your Ten Defining Moments, Seven Critical Choices and Five Pivotal People. The exercises really have to be done to be useful. While I think it is a very good book, I would have liked more stories and examples, since I think as is obvious from his TV show that this is where he really shines. Power Path to Love"
3,"What's up with the ""scoring""?",I can't believe more people don't question how you are supposed to score Appendix A and B? I have searched all over the book and tried sending an e-mail through their web site. No response. How frustrating. I guess it's pretty easy to figure out where one stands just by reading the book but it really does show poor editing to publish the book without all of the information.
1,Gives Self-Help a Bad Name,"This book is an excerise in claptrap. I have read numerous self-help books by the likes of Dr. Albert Ellis, Dr. David Burns and Dr. Wayne Dyer, and I can tell you that Philip McGraw steals from them all. For example, is it a coincidence that Wayne has a book called ""Your Sacred Self"" and now here comes Phil (I refuse to call him ""Doctor"") with ""Self Matters""? He may be good on TV, but his book is really shallow. You'd be far better served by reading one of the authors I've already mentioned."
2,Save your money!,"I checked this book out at my local library. Thank God! I usually like watching Dr. McGraw on TV and maybe he's a good counselor, but this book was awful. First of all, it was boring. Secondly, it was poorly written, and thirdly his advice seemed to me to be heavy handed and simplistic. There are better self help books out there, there just have to be. And for those other reviewers who wondered how it got to be a bestseller. Can you say Oprah?"
1,Self Matters,The author is entertaining as a guest on Oprah. He often is insightful on TV.This is not the case in this book. The author requires five pages to convey a thought which should be clearly stated in a single paragraph. Ever read a book you thought was more intended to make a buck for the author than what was stated in the title and promos ? ...Three cheers to anyone who gets much out of this book.
3,Self Matters,"I'm only about half way done. It's ok, and a lot of good advice that is worth incorporating, but it doesn't keep me riveted like his book Life Strategies did. That theme was to realize your actions have consequences, which is useful for getting over feeling like a victim, and start feeling personal power.That being said, I will continue through it. His advice is unadulterated, get back on the horse type of advice. It's a good foundation. The theme this time is defining who you are and what is impt to you. It's a seminal exercise - it just takes some willpower to get through it."
5,My reveiw,I thought that this book was filled with useful information and I really liked it for those of us that are trying to change our lives.
5,Shows you Self Really Does Matter,"I believe any one who needs some selfesteem should read this book. I read it once, then I read it again slower so I could fully understand exactly what it was saying. I recommened this book highly. A++++++"
1,"""Selfishness Matters"" might be a better title","A person in midlife crisis is often hoping to fill the emptiness in their soul by seeking some selfish gain. This is just the bookto help them justify their selfishness. It is important to examine our lives and see where we may need healing from past hurts that are holding us back from reaching our full potential. For this purpose the book could be helpful if it's potential for harm were not so great. However, this book is based on a faulty assumption that people are basically good until they are hurt in some way. Under this assumption, if we heal the hurts, we will again be basically good. No, we will still be basically selfish! If you are looking for a book to justify your selfishness, you found it. Just what our culture needs, more justification for selfishness. Thanks Dr McGraw."
1,useless book,"this is the most useless book I have ever bought, Phillip C. McGraw is a good salesperson but if you read the book you hope to find at least one useful sentence. I am sorry to say the book was a total waste of time"
1,More of the same...,"I received the book as a gift. The title put me off to begin with...in a world so much in distress, it says a lot about the western world's inwardness and self-obssession. The book is more of the same psycho-babble that has been pouring off the shelves since the 1970's; offering no more than silly answers to a deeply neurotic, isolated society. The book however, could be used successfully as a model of how to exploit one's professional field to a large and needy audience-- and become very, very wealthy in the process."
1,Another fat piece of trash that thinks he can play God,"It always amazes me at how desperate people have become in our society. It's even more hilarious and shocking that people will throw away their dignity and respect to allow some fat piece of trash like Dr. Phil tell them what their problems are in front of millions of people. Whatever happened to people's sense of self-respect? Then again, with shows like Jersey Shore and The Biggest Loser bringing in millions of auidence members from across the nation, I guess the word ""desperation"" has become a big focal point of popularity. In short, I guess Dr. Phil fits perfectly into spectrum.Dr. Phil is nothing more than a egoistical freak who likes to play God. It's funny that we have yet to see any evidence that he's even a real Dr. I guess TV allows us to be whoever we want right?Maybe he should allow me on his show. I've always wanted my fifteen minutes of fame. And, outsmarting a moron isn't difficult at all."
1,Get Real People!,"While the excercises in this book might make you look closer at the influential people in your life. I do not like the overall self help stand point. You can not change your entire life with a book! This book could be interpreted the wrong way by the already self centered person (that doesn't realize it). My overall review of this book is, it is not for me & be careful not to take what you read to literally."
5,This book made me a published author! :),"I can honestly say that this book changed my life. I followed the exercises and within 4 months, I had tripled my authenticity score. This book, and it's journal companion, helped me set goals and achieve them. ""Waiting for You: An Heirloom Adoption Journal for My Future Child"" is now my dream come true. THANK YOU DR. PHIL! :)"
1,Capitalizing on his fame,"TV is the proper forum for Dr. Phil's platitudes. The self-induced strife of the show's guests are entertaining, and makes the viewer want to slap a little sense into them. Dr. Phil steps in a does just that, vicariously applying the slaps, and we feel thankful to him.Beneath Dr. Phil's oozing earnestness and rectitude there is nothing profound, original, or particulary instructive. All the material in this book could be compressed into a few solid pages. The rest is fluff, most of the form; ""When you follow my advice, you will be happy/succeed/fix your marraige/lose weight"". He continues in this fashion, rarely specifically stating anything that might qualify as advice.Robbins, Dyer, Mandido, Carnegie, et. al. have more to say and say it better."
1,I was looking for a pick me up and ended up feeling worst,"I, a huge fan of the Dr. Phil TV show, was shocked that this book was horrible. Dr. Phil assumes that the reader has extremely low self esteem. Which is fine, except how he writes this assumption. For example...The reason why you think you are stupid is....etc. As I was reading I felt emotions of defensiveness. I don't think of my self as stupid or a loser. Once I read past being the many knock downs from Dr. Phil, there was no good substance in this book. None! I was looking for a pick me up and ended up feeling worst."
2,Banal psychology,"While this book had something to say it truly doesn't divulge anything earth shattering or original. I knew where the doc was going by the end of the second CD. All this book did for me was to reaffirm what I already know about myself. I guess it can be helpful to those who feel lost or find themselves trapped in relationships or situations they really don't want but it did very little for me. As well the doc's preachy voice got to be annoying after a while and his good old boy attitude just turned me right off. Like most self help books out there the people who right them assume everybody is the same, they come from the same background, socioeconomic status, race, sexual orientation and so on. In short, if you are more or less close to the lifestyle the doc lives this book might be helpful. I borrowed this one from my library and I'm glad I did. My recommendation, do the same. Its nothing exemplary."
3,Starts off good.,"Good if you are willing to do the work. I like the inspirational talk at the beginning, but wasn't interested in the rest. Tried reading the book first and had a hard time getting to the end...now I know why."
2,not a keeper,"I was bored with this book from the beginning. The writing to capture your interest is just not there. There are much, much better self-help books than this."
3,THE MULTI-TALENTED HAVE DIFFERENT WIRING!,"Dr. Phil knows so much about how most of us work and this book includes much of his wisdom. A piece of shame that wasn't addressed, though, is the kind people feel who can't 'settle down and do just one thing.' ..."
5,life-changing,"Before I bought this book, I wasn't quite sure what the big deal was about Dr. Phil. Now, you might say, I get it. I also understand a lot of the things that I have been thinking and doing that have been holding me back from becoming the person I really want to be. His advice is matter-of-fact and applicable to real life, and he breaks it down so people without doctorates in psychology can understand what he's talking about. He also has a sense of humor, which is important.This book has a lot of ""homework""--writing exercises you're supposed to do to help you figure things out--but it's useful and revealing, and really helped me to get to know myself. Even if you've tried similar self-help books, I suggest you at least give this one a glance. It really could change your life; I know it changed mine."
3,"Helpful and Insightful, But Not For the Lazy","Both the Self Matters audio CD and the print paperback companion workbook are wonderfully warm and relatable: delivered straight up in that patented no-nonsense McGraw style. But most of the the book and/or CD ""Self Matters"" is just used as a jumping off point for the self-directed ""homework"" assigned to the reader in the companion workbook. He's not gonna give you many answers - he's just gonna point which direction you get to start looking in."
4,i learned a lot!,I truly reccommend this if you are trying to learn why thing is life are not working for you!
1,NEVER GETS TO THE POINT,"Monumentally disappointing, Self Matters by Phillip C. McGraw never really gets started. Dr. Phil asks the usual questions: do you feel like...have you ever thought...do you want to...? Sure you do. Well in a minute I will give you all the answers. Interestingly, and like a lot of similar books, the answers never come. That's because each of us is so individual and so complex that books such as this can't deliver like they attempt. Skip this one."
3,common sense,"I've gotten most of Dr. Phil's books. After reading them, my conclusion is it is all common sense. If you just stop and think things out there is no need to buy these books. Mine always end up back on amazon as used and there is always someone there to purchase them. :-)"
2,I Don't Think So,"Another book by the mega-egotist Phil McGraw, recycling all the information that others have presented much better. Don't waste your money on this one - you'd be better off with the classic ""The Power of Positive Thinking"""
2,You must be pretty low to benefit from this book,"You must be pretty low to benefit from this book. It was so boring, same thing over and over. He goes on making you feel really low so that you feel like only Dr. Phil can save you. I have a hard time believing that people really like this. I guess I'm successful and happy with my life because I turned it off (audio book) after about 45 minutes. That's all I could take."
2,Full of Phil,"After plodding through page after page, chapter after chapter of excruciatingly critical self examination, I am exhausted! Phil really carries on and on in an attempt to help strip away ones unauthentic self and find happiness. Although peppered with his colorfully redundant Texan talk, I found this reading/learning experience pretty worthless. After all of his rhetoric about being more real with themselves, Phil does not seem to follow his own advice. In the few closing paragraphs, Phil attributes his success (at breaking away to a better life) to having a great wife....So maybe we all ought to do is go out and buy one of those instead of the book."
1,Was Dr. Phil seriously the Author of this book?,"This book was very disappointing. I was about 2/3 of the way through and I finally had to quit. I've been impressed with his other books and am so surprised that he really authored this book. In my opinion it was depressing and definitely should not be in the category of ""self-help,"" unless you're trying to help yourself get really down and out."
2,Don't get the CD version!,"I borrowed the CD version of this book from the public library after listening to the cassette version of ""Life Strategies"" on my daily commute to work and liking it a lot. What a disappointment --- Dr Phil wasn't the reader! The reader has a very nice voice, but I felt cheated hearing Dr Phil's stories, words, phraseology, etc. from someone else's mouth. Being so familiar with his vocal patterns from watching his show and listening to the previous audio book, I was so distracted I couldn't really follow it. From what I can gather, the reader is on the unabridged version, so maybe the abridged version has Dr Phil reading it. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't buy it."
4,Failure of book still unaddressed.....,"The following is a quote from the review of ""A reader"" on Nov. 19, 2001.""As the worst example of this problem, the book has blatantly obvious appendices A and B for the internal factors that influence you. Nowhere could I find a way to score these questions, while the text blithely discusses what your point totals mean.""And I thought that I had missed something! My experience with appendices A and B was the same as that given in the above review, and I am puzzled as to why Dr. Phil has not addressed this confusion of the book.Other than that, I find the book to be an amazing and extremely insightful, helpful work. Far excels anything of it's kind, including that of John Bradshaw. I'm glad I found it. I'm in my second reading and still have work to do! Wonderful promise of hope."
2,Dissapointing,"I really enjoyed his ""Life Strategies"" book - however I found that this book fell short. Too much talk and no action. The majority of the first few chapters are pointless. He tells you how not to read the book, how TO read the book, what he IS going to do, and what he is NOT going to do... but he doesn't actually DO ANYTHING. Dissapointing and frustrating to read."
2,typical China quality,"These are not your Craftsman tool quality but for occasional use, they're fine.I was disappointed enough that I threw one of them away before using it."
3,Good Tools!,It's Ok! Nothing else... I don't wanna write more!!! My English is not very good! See ya!!! Buy more!!! Amazon is great!
5,Price-wise ... good buy!,"For the price this is a good buy. I received the tools and am happy with the quality. This, as mentioned in the other review, is a ""spare"" set and will serve perfectly!"
3,Plier Set,"This plier set was as described, however I was hoping it would be of the quality standards that stanley usually has. These pliers are a cheaper version, still functional, but not as smooth of a finish with rounded edges as you see in a high quality set of pliers. It is is adequate for a backup set of pliers,"
5,Great Buy - Great Performance,"Stanley is a trusted name. This set takes into consideration the tools that a shade-tree (or pro) mechanic needs on a regular basis -- gripping, cutting, stripping, curling, levering power. Well-made and attractive.And THIS says it all:""Forged-steel construction for durabilityRust-resistant finish for greater protection; double-dipped handle for extra comfortHardened cutting edges and chrome-nickel steel for extra-tough cutting edge""Pro features for a very good price. Expect these to last a long time.They fit well in the hand -- are comfortably ergonomic, do the job well, and the yellow strip could help keep it visible in a crowded toolbox."
3,Stanley 3 piece basic tool set,"These are slightly larger and definitely clunkier than I expected. I wanted a small, functional set to keep/use in my apartment, and these aren't ideal for that. Consistent with their 'basic' description, they are coarsely made. They seem perfectly functional and were inexpensive, but are definitely the least pleasing to hold/use of any needle-nosed pliers or wire cutters or pliers I've ever handled."
1,Don't bother,"The writing is unfocused, the author's definitions are problematically loose (she often refers to suicide terror, non-suicide terror, insurgency, and guerrilla warfare interchangeably - they are not the same), her logic is often flawed, many of her assertions are unsupported by data, and she mercilessly desecrates the English language with her poor punctuation and grammar and innumerable sentence fragments. The editor responsible for this at Columbia University Press should resign in shame."
4,Wonderful Holiday Season Pattern,I love the Winterberry pattern by Pfaltzgraff and am collecting it as much as possible. Be aware that this item must be handwashed since it is handpainted. I wish Pfaltzgraff would make dishwasher safe handpainted items.
1,Quasi Intellectual Drivel,"A person with a PhD in Physics with no basic grasp of science. Straight out of the Deepak Chopra mold. She may be right (or wrong) about some basic concepts. Unfortunately, the intellectual methods used to arrive at her conclusions are so full psuedo logic that we will never know. This book is full of drivel from start to finish. I give you this single gem...""Unsustainable outcomes are the inevitable result of the deepening patriarchal domination over ways of knowing and relating non-violently to what have been identified as ""lesser species,"" including women. But sustainability can be created by an inclusive feminism, an ecological feminism, in which the freedom of every species is linked to the liberation of women, in which the tiniest life form is recognized as having intrinsic worth, integrity, and autonomy.""""ways of knowing""... this person has lost touch with reality."
3,Different twist,I enjoyed them but would not purchase a second time. I liked the grainy texture of the rice flour. Packaging and wording on package was clever.
5,As Advertised,Excellent replacement puck with epoxy adhesive. Works as indicate with specified humminbird products. Worth the cost if a second transducer is needed.
5,Wow!!!,"This bra actually gave my chest a seductive,sexy look.I love it for that reason and also it fitts comfortable and perfect."
4,Super Support,I am very much satisfied with the service I received and the product is wonderful. Good support and conture. I only wear Vanity Fair Bra's. I will be ordering more.
3,Spanish review,"Aparentemente la numeración corre grande ya que cuando recibí la mercancía, con la numeración que acostumbro a utilizar me quedó bastante grande, debido a que la devolución me saldría muy costosa porque tendría que pagar UPS no lo devolví pero tampoco lo he podido utilizar. Sin embargo, el material parece ser bueno."
2,2012 is just the end of another 52 year cycle,"They Mayan calendar consits of 2 separate calendars, the Tzolkin and Haab. It takes 52 years for the Tzolkin and Haab calendars to move through a complete cycle. 2012 is just another of these cycles. The world will not end. :-) Rather, it is a cycle of rebirth. If we were ancient Mayans, on that day we would burn our homes and build them anew."
2,The real End Times on 2012,"I will make the boldest prediction of all... and when the time comes, you will remember this. Great spirits have come to me... great spirits... They have revealed their predictions and they have revealed their secret names to me. Remember this well on 2102. The named spirits were Jackson Danniels, James Beehm, Jonathon Wocker, and the ancient Russian sage, Stolly Chanaya... And here is what they said - in telepathic visions to me: On January 1, 2012, this is what will happen:""The year 2011 will now be 2012."" And later that year, many peoples will predict the end times will again visit in 2039 and that they never really meant 2012... it was a telekinetic typo...."
1,Another failed doomsday,"Well...now that it is Dec 22 2012,it looks like the people were once again decieved to believe a lie.It's just too bad that people don't trust in God's holy word,which is the absolute truth,which tells us that NOBODY will know the hour or date...not the angels...not the son....GOD THE FATHER ONLY.(Matthew 24:36)"
3,Nice recount of Maya and MesoAmerican myths and culture,"This book deals with so much information about measurements and alignments it made my brain tingle, but it could have been shortened a little. Still captivating literature nonetheless."
5,inspriational and eye opening for the esoteric !!!,"I can not understand why people don't take these matters a little more seriously. Cosmogenesis 2012 is not the only book that talks about this scenario, in fact even the bible talks about the same symbolism. You are on the right track, keep up the good work, our ancestors will be proud."
3,"A deep work, but the meat is the last chapter","No doubt JMJ has done lots of research and presents lots of evidence for his conclusions. However, if you want to know what 2012 is all about, what is it supposed to do for mankind, there is one chapter at the very end with very little.This book is about MesoAmericas long-running fascination with time, stars and calendars. This is an archeological study. This is not a book about 2012."
4,Fascinating,"Full of interesting facts about the Mayan civilization, how they saw the earth and their brilliant understanding of the Universe. I now understand how the complex calendar works. As to the prophecy, yet again, we can only wait and see!"
5,Excellent Blade,This is not the first Hitachi blade that I have bought. For the money this blade gives an excellent cut and holds its edge for a good amount of time. I've used a lot of blades in the past and believe me this is a great deal. I have been in the woodworking industry for almost 40 years and I know what I am talking about.
5,Excellent Book !!!!,"I am very impressed with this book. Buy it today! It is so easy to follow. A person who has never worked out before would feel at ease using it. And, for those who workout often, it is a great way to hone your body sculpting skills and success in less than one month!Through the use of pictures, the author provides the reader excercises they can use whether at the gym or home. The nutrition plan is easy to follow and has ""normal"" food. No fluff in the book, no fad diets, no pushing of supplements - just the honest truth. He has done a real service to the public and the fitness industry by creating such a solid book."
5,Great Book,"This book is excellent and easy to follow. It provides easy to follow weightlifting and cardio workouts, in addition to great meal plans, which are extremely effective and reasonable. I highly recommend this book!!"
4,"seems good, but no results yet","I have been on this plan for almost three weeks. I have not been following the diet, but I am adhering to the recommended amount of calories. I like the plan and have started looking forward to my workouts, but I haven't seen any results yet.There are only two complaints that I have and they are that a few of the exercises use equipment that is outdated so my gym doesn't have it (like the butt blaster) so I've had to find alternative exercises. The other thing is that for the cardio the time intervals are not easy to follow when you're actually on the machine because it says for two minutes do this and then for three minutes... which is hard to keep track of. I would like to see a breakdown such as: minutes 1-3 walk 4-5 run, etc. which would be easier. I have ended up copying it onto another piece of paper.However it is easy to get started and is user friendly. I hope to see results soon."
5,Excellent Resource,"I am still new to using the Bach Flower Remedies. However, this book helps guide me tremendously. Thank you so much for writing such an easy to read book. I am so glad that I found Homeopathy and the Bach Flower Remedies."
1,It's a Theory!,"Erik Erikson made a HUGE contribution to various areas of the Social Sciences. His work, however, was theoretical. Since it was theoretical, it is open to interpretation, application, etc. Otherwise, his work would be fact! Any basic Human Development course or text would reveal a more accurate critique of Erikson's work. Dewart provides a critique based on her religious beliefs--which is fine, except that you will note that all of her writings are pointing out which theorists, philosophers, ideologies do not match her religious beliefs.You would think that someone writing a book about the errors of a major psychological theory would have a more appropriate background than Dewart's--she is a ventriloquist doing bible puppet shows! Don't waste your time with this one. Fabricant's book does a much better job of showing how Erikson's theory aligns with most religious doctrine, instead of running counter to it."
1,Not really epoxy,"This particular product is not truly epoxy in that it WILL create a fit between two rocks (etc), but does NOT adhere them. It's consistency and adhesiveness is comparable to dried bubble gum, so keep that in mind. It is useful if used in conjunction with superglue, but at that point it kind of defeats the purpose in my opinion. I would not recommend it."
4,Gets the job done.,I ordered this to repair a pump (Hydor Korlia 3) because it broke from its magnetic base. I put it on and it looks great in my tank. But there are some problems i have had with it. For one it smells HORIBLE when you are using it. If you ever used mighty putty then you know what i am talking about. Also when applying it and it is very loose. But all-in-all it does what it says and gets the job done.
2,usual tension as elusive as smoke in a mirror...,"I've read almost everything Krentz has written, under any of her pen names. This is not one of her best efforts. She seemed unable to decide whether the primary threat should be academic envy or the flaky self-help guru, and the story lacked focus on the leading couple. The result is a half realized and not very convincing threat to the heroine. The romantic interludes don't even have her usual steamy tension. I usually buy all Krentz's books in hardback when they first come out. Maybe I'll start waiting for the paperbacks. Here's hoping that this is a fluke and that future releases, under whatever pen name, return to her usual standard of good storytelling, interesting plot lines, humor and romance."
2,The end of the road,I won't be buying anymore of Jayne Ann Krentz's books. Although I was a huge fan. This book is incredibly formula driven. It's the same old plot she's done again and again and the stereotype of the librarian/heroine as sexually repressed is offensive.
1,Not a good read!,"I have read all of Jayne Krentz's novels and as always, some are better than others. I just picked up the book to read yesterday and I honestly couldn't finish it. The plot was somewhat shallow leading in with characters that spark attraction yet you don't really care or feel an affinity with them. The academia and the end antagonist who was behind it all was not set up properly. When I found out who was behind all the killings, I thought to myself, ""WHAT??"" It was a minor character who lacked a real motive and all in all, the story was flat. I really like her novels but this one is not worth the read."
2,A Big Disappointment,This is not her best work. I had read more compelling book by her. The plot was too convulted. The characters didn't impressed me. The ending could of been better.
3,Uninspired ending,"I have been reading JAK for more years than I want to admit (and through all her incarnations). This book was better than I anticipated (I haven't enjoyed her last couple of books), but it doesn't live up to some of her earlier works.I enjoyed the book up until the end when the murderer was unveiled. I found the ""twist"" ending unbelievable - Why would someone who had gotten away with six murders over 30 years try to kill yet another person hours before starting a new life?This book lacks the sparkle of earlier JAK novels, but it is still a good read."
2,Not a page turner,"A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up. From the start, I had to force myself to keep going. I read the whole book, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Disappointing!,"I've read several of her books lately and liked most of them. This one was just not as interesting. I didn't like the story line. The gothic atmosphere of the library and the information about mirrors didn't hold my attention. As far as the characters went, there wasn't enough meat here. I couldn't feel connected to them. She is a witty writer and I loved the Eclipse Bay series, but this one didn't cut it for me."
2,What happened!!!!!,"I think I have just about everything Ms. Krentz has ever written and have always enjoyed her characters and plots. I was sadly dissapointed on this latest novel, ""Smoke and Mirrors"". There was no chemistry between the main characters. No strong but sensative male and a rather tepid female. I think I will just have to go back and re-read all the oldie but goodies and wait for the paper back to come out from now on."
1,Get it at the library. . .,"if you really MUST read it. But, really, this ""novel"" isn't even worth getting at the library. (Thank God I did, though!) Every cliched description and conversation, as well as lines from previous Krentz novels, make up this adolescent effort. The ""love"" scenes are painfully embarrassing, the plot line weak and contrived, and the ending is ridiculous. Krentz has never had the talent that Roberts or Crusie can claim, but many of her books have been at least entertaining (I'm thinking of her Eclipse Bay trilogy). This effort is truly irritating and immature. . .or could it be that Krentz is tired of her chosen genre? This book would seem to indicate it. I'd prefer to give it half a star for the description of the mirrors but that option isn't available."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Although the plots and dialogue have improved compared to earlier novels, the characters seem to be suffering. I agree with another reader and also did not enjoy Smoke in Mirrors OR Lost and Found as much as previous books. However, it's something to be said that JAK is still one of the best in the romance/suspense category in spite of these last two releases."
3,Pretty Flat,"I used to love Jayne Ann Krentz. This book is just not up to her usual standards. The dialogue is not as snappy, I was rather startled the first time the hero and heroine fell into bed, and the identity of the first murderer was obvious from the start. The identity of the second murderer escaped me until the end, but it didn't make much sense. Not one of her better books, although the prologue was exceptional."
1,Bethany Unmasked,"Like, I suspect, many readers of the Bethany series, the changing of the guard in the White House from a republican to a democrat caused the Tom Bethany character to be unmasked. Where, in the earlier works, Bethany is portrayed as a man cynical of government (note his references to Albert Jay Nock's early works) it becomes apparent in the novel ""Half Nelson"" that the character speaks out against government only so long as there is a republican to be despised.Doolittle fumbled the ball, in my view, by allowing his glee that a democrat occupies the White House to show through into the Bethany character's personality, changing Bethany's attitude from that of a free thinker who despises government corruption into that of a partisan party supporter.I'm glad that the author dropped all pretense and revealed himself, the series was becoming tiresome anyway."
2,Too Metallic,"Unfortunately, these shoes are just a little too metallic for me. They didn't look so ""shiny"" in the picture. I feel a little like the FTD Florist man when wearing them. (The gold ones are even more so; I ordered those first and sent them back...) I don't wear them as much as I might if they were just plain brown."
3,extreem love,"some time we have to admired things which we don't have ,which indeed don't mean much for those who have it . we allways look biynd our sight,egnoring what in btween . some time we don't entermidate our inside feeling towards those who we exteemly love .we semply lose them in the franteer suspiose."
2,disappointing,"We bought the 3 new disney princesses DVD in a package.The ""gift from the heart"" DVD is really poor... old stories, a few of the stories are not even movies.. just drawings with a voice off.As for the party DVD, you can find much better ideas if you go online and look for some ideas in family fun. Boring for parents and even more for the kids themselves.We didn't even watch the sing along DVD. Nobody's looking forward to watching it.FYI, my girls are 4 and 5. Don't waste your money on those..."
2,Quite disappointing!,"As a diehard Disney fan, I was excited to get this new DVD for my 3 1/2 year old daughter. Unfortunately, this one was a complete waste of money as the two new stories (from Beauty and the Beast, and the Little Mermaid) appeared as if Disney gave its animation interns a crack at seeing what they could do.Not good!The other features on the disc...party planning, games, one music video...held both mine and my daughter's interest for about three seconds.It will certainly not keep me away from just about everything Disney puts out in the future, but I could not recommend this one any less."
1,Horrible,This was a huge disappointment....there is very little content and very few fun ideas. My 5 year old watched it once but isn't interested in seeing it again. A waste of money.
1,Bleahh.,"Our little girl is totally into the whole Disney princess thing, so I figured, what the heck -- a couple of cartoons, a few games on the computer -- how bad could this be? Pretty bad, it turns out. The cartoons are poorly produced and dull, and the games (which were kind of the main attraction) aren't really computer games, but rather suggestions for how to stage ""party games"" in the real world. You know, fun stuff like staging a scavenger hunt or making tiaras out of construction paper. Wow. Get that Disney magic going -- the full weight of the whole studio behind you! Whoo-hoo. We previewed this and didn't even bother showing it to our kid -- she would have been really disappointed. (Joe Sixpack)"
3,Rotisserie Kit,No complaints about this product. This rotisserie didn't fit my grill though (Char Griller Duo). The picture did represent the picture shown. The product shown was shipped on time for my need of the item.
4,Very durable,I bought this several years ago and expose the motor year round to the elements. It still works. It is nothing fancy but it gets the job done.
1,Needs better advertising,"I have a weber grill and was given this as a gift. Surprise, surprise it does not fit a weber grill!No where on the box does it advertise that this is the only type of gas grill not supported."
4,"Great power roller, and they sell replacement parts.","The Homeright Painter is great.I had a Wagner before this, and the pump broke because a chunk of dried paint got stuck. I Could have easily fixed it, but Wagner does not sell any replacement parts at all.The Homeright comes with a complete parts list and diagram. It sits on top of the paint can and pumps automatically. You control the paint flow by pressing a valve button.Cleaning is easy too.My only complaint is that it was advertised by Amazon as a new item, but the one I received was refurbished and was manufactured 4 years ago. The metal tubes were bent flat and I had to re-shape them before I could use it."
5,Best Soda's work,"This,their third cd is,in my opinion,the most mature of the first three cds,which,by the way,are the best ones.Different sound,better singing,a classic of it's time.To favorites to consider:El Rito and Signos.Try it,if you want to hear a good example of good latin american rock."
5,Uno de los mejores,"Junto con Dynamo, Signos encabeza mis recomendaciones de los discos de Soda.Este disco aparte de mostrar un cambio en la calidad del sonido de la época tiene canciones simplemente espectaculares.Creo que Signos es una canción de Virus que Soda hizo con mas estilo. No existes y Final Caja Negra son también muy destacables.Disco para tener si o si en la colección."
2,"Nice, but...","Ok, in the inside everything was good, but the cd case was broken, now i have a perfect CD with a BROKEN case :("
4,Refreshing,It's nice to find a travel guide with subjective (rather than gushing) descriptions of all manner of things ranging from cities to hotels to vegetarian specials. This guide is chock full of phone numbers and web sites and price guidelines and has proved to be a helpful (and fun)resource.
5,Extremely helpful and thorough,"While planning a return trip to Ireland, I looked a every current guidebook I could find. ""Footprint Ireland"" is the only one I will take with me on my trip. It is very comprehensive, provides clear descriptions without tourist hype, and includes the practical detail you need to make the best use of your time (ferry schedules, opening hours, etc.) It also provides good information on local walks, short and long, an important part of any successful Irish visit. By far and away, it has more helpful information, well presented with good design, than any other guide I found."
4,Very Cute,"Very cute but a little too large to be a keychain, we were hoping it was a bit smaller, it is abou 4-5 inches high and too big to fit into a purse. Ended up hanging it from the cars visor insead so am happy."
2,Colorization of B/W Favorites,"1. Wise Quackers (1949, Freleng; co-stars Elmer Fudd)2. The Impatient Patient (1942, McCabe)3. Porky and Daffy (1938, Clampett; co-stars Porky Pig)4. Porky Pig's Fear (1943, Tashlin; co-stars Porky)5. Stork Naked (1955, Freleng)The only problem with this VHS is that ""The Impatient Patient,"" ""Porky and Daffy,"" and ""Porky Pig's Feat"" are computer-colorized, originally B/W. Don't tamper with the classics."
3,Weak and farfetched.,"Cripple with a clubfoot, lady's maid Meg Quincy was an unusual servant. She knew how to read, loved poetry, and spoke like a lady. Richard, Lord Beaumont, vowed to never marry, but his dying mother begged that he propose to Allegra, their neighbor's obnoxious daughter. Trapped by love for his mother, Richard agrees, only to be taken by Meg. Mysteries about Meg's background complicate her work for Lady Semple's daughter, Allegra.A wannabe bit of froth and frolic that is too predictable and lacks depth and real humor. The ending was unrealistic. Kennedy shows promise, but needs more logic and realism in the relationships between servant and master/mistress."
3,I needed fuel line shut off as well,"Verify if you have a fuel shut off or not before purchasing this product. My fuel will continue to flow, I installed another set from a friend and gave these away."
3,chalk marker,I didnt think this worked very well...could not see the lines after trying over and over...would not purchase again or recommend
1,Waste of time & Money,"This is nothing anyone should spend their money on. It has only 5 or 6 film clips that they show over and over again. The narratives are not very helpful as these people did not know him. I was very disappointed and glad I only rented it. Had I purchased it, I would be sending it back!!"
1,Piece of Trash!!,"This was so deceiving! I bought this cause i thought it was suppose to be about Micheal Jackson.All it was was abunch of people claiming to know what was in his head! More repeated footage of stuff that has been shown over and over again! Where was Princess Di telling her story? ""Moonwalking: The True Story of Micheal Jackson BY Princess Diana"" yea where's that????I am sending mine back cause it aint worthless! [...]!"
2,Michael Jackson has a true spirit,"I grew up with Michael Jackson and lived through all the bad press, well this video has two psychologist picking Michael Jackson apart, bit by bit, piece by piece on his addictions, and plastic surgeries ect.. For me a true story would be telling Michael Jackson contribution for all humanity and let the past be in the past, in other words let a lying dog lie. I am sick of hearing about the 1993 charges, and the changing of his skin, who cares, the point is Michael had the true spirit of giving, he was an inspirtation to us all, and in his death he does not deserve to be picked apart and put under a microscope. The only good part to this video is it shows michael meeting princess diana, and some of his interviews. As I die hard fan I am boycotting any more bad press on behalf of a great legend. Don't buy this video."
1,Save you Money,"I expected a wonderful positive video about Michael, I was so wrong, instead this was a video with doctors giving their point of view and brief (I mean brief inserts that were played over and over) I just got this today and it's going back tomorrow. RIP MJJ"
1,"If you respect truth, don't buy this!","This book does not make sense. Spend your money and valuable time for other books that make sense and tell the truth about MJ. ""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" is highly recommended."
1,Waste of money,"I had expected something interesting from Moonwalking - when in fact this video is quite crappy. DO NOT waste your money. Seems as if this video was made to show all how different he was and did not emphasize the person he truly was- a humanitarian who loved all and cared about the human condition. In addition, there is minimal footage of Michael Jackson. I'd have to say in total there's probably less than 4 minutes of footage of him on the ""entire"" DVD. This also comes with a small book of which I haven't read - but after seeing the video, I do not have the desire to do so. I repeat: DO NOT PURCHASE DO NOT PURCHASE DO NOT PURCHASE!!"
1,HELPFUL REVIEWS,"I read all of the above reviews and they told me all I need to know. This is just another false premise look at someone they know nothing about. I include myself in the leagues of Michael's loyal and loving fans. To me and millions of others, he does not need to be explained by so-called experts. Just so much hogwash."
5,a keeper,"I own all 5 volumes in Japanese! But now that it is in English, even better. The story does get better and becomes very endearing too.Vol 1 starts out kind of slow introducing almost all of the key players. Although the art style aren't as bishounen as most beloved series, the facial features and body proportions are well done. What makes this series a keeper are the story and character interaction. It is very mild BL not full-fledge Yaoi."
5,"Boring covers, BUT a great story lies inside","I'd hate to think that many over look this series because of the boring, unimpressive covers. But don't be fooled! What this series lack in art (compared to others out there), they make up with a wonderful story.A story that older women can enjoy with a sweet tone throughout the series. And unique compared to the many office men affairs books out there since this revolves around folks in a rare career. Throwing in responsibilities with an offspring, and a deceased lover, helps keep the tone serious which I enjoy."
5,Excellent for beginners,I began my American Indian roots exploration with this book. It is a wonderful book that teaches the interconnection of everything in life. Definitely a good read - I bought it so that I may refer back from time to time.
5,walk in harmony,"If you want to find balance in your life, this book is an excellent way to start on that pathway."
1,Publishing a Book to Promote Consulting Services,"As suggested by another reviewer, this book is actually little more than a thinly veiled advertisement for the professional consulting services of the author. Hey, if you've written a book you must be an authority! And worth enormous fees! Talk with people who have actually worked with them before plunking out the big bucks for their ""services""."
3,Coho yo,"I like this book on coho. I liked it so much that I tried to form a coho. Not so easy. You need a lot of time and you need a lot of patience. Money is very helpful too. The people that write coho how to books seem to be in the coho business, so a book is a great promotional tool.If want to build a coho, this is a good book to start with, but read all the other books as well. Then visit a bunch and look at a bunch on the Internet. They are as different as the communities that surround them. Our society needs many more cohos because they can be an anchor for good. And our communities can use all the help that they can get."
4,Shiloh by James Raesoner,"I enjoyed the book. (also the first in the series, Manassas) However I found the level of writing somewhat more suited for a "" young adult"" rather than an adult. Very weak on battle details, however I don't think the intent was to teach about the civil war, just entertain. Also a fairly predictable story line with obivious plot development."
3,Reality In An Orchard,"Cory Brannan a member of the Brannan family that we have not met was working on the river in New Madrid, Missouri. Here he meets Captain Farrell of the ""Missouri Zephyr."" This book is about Cory's adventures on the river and his love of Lucille, the captain's daughter. The author does tie Ft. Henry and Ft. Donelson into his story. Again Reasoner saves end of his book for the Battle of Shiloh. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,Better than Book One,"Even if you didn't read book one, this is a good read. This concentrates on the life of Cory Brannon, who was just slightly mentioned in book one. I had to get my hands on book three shortly after finishing this volume. Reasoner does a great job of mixing suspense in with historical significance from the Civil War."
3,pricing should change,good stuff but pricing is strange due to the fact that they are made by the same company and have two different pricing that should be fixed if anything
5,"You want a yummy film-set ""Craft Service"" item? Well... here it is!","As a rule, I try to review things in at least a semi-serious fashion...But -- after working on film and television sets for years, I can ASSURE you that ""Andy Capp's Hot Fries"" (particulary in this size) are a huge deal , right up there with ""they have Red-Bull in the cooler"" at the craft service (snack) table!Suddenly, stars and regular folks in production become salty hot snack food VAMPIRES! Health food goes out the door, as people grab this product, as though it was never seen before.If you have never tried this, you should, as this is NOT the typical vending machine size.Snack like Hollywood does!~ This really is one of the items found on the better,and fun set's!"
5,My daughter can finish a box within three weeks!,I introduced this snack to my oldest daughter years ago and when I saw that Amazon's price was better per bag than our local dollar stores I promptly added a case to my grocery order. Amazon ships fast and my daughter is thrilled to see 30 bags of her favorite snack all for her!!These are the perfect flavor combination of potato & corn crunchy flavor with spicy heat mixed in. Do not buy other brands as Andy Capp's have the best flavor over the imitators. When my daughter goes off to college I will be shipping these to her dorm room regularly.
5,THESE HOT FRIES ARE THE BEST,IVE ORDERED THESE HOT FRIES LIKE 4 TIMES THIS YEAR ALONE. I LOVE ANYTHING FROM ANDY CAPP. THESE PUPPIES ARE HOT AND I HATE ANY TYPE OF HOT FOOD. BUT THESE HOT FRIES I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF!!
5,Best darn munchin ever,Sometimes I like to stuff the fries in my clothing. I will name my first-born son Andy in honor of these fries. Mmmmmm hot fries....
1,Extremely Hot and Salty!,"These things will burn off your tongue and throat. You cannot even eat half the bag in one sitting. Even worse, they are very salty, so if you suffer from high blood pressure do not buy this item!!!"
3,GOOD,"There are some absolute killer funk compilations out there. Superfunk is not one.There is nothing bad about this CD-I mean not good, I don't mean ""superbad"". It has deep grooves and poppier funk. It does not delve into jazzier material. All tracks included are fine, not great.If you are a funkaphile or collector, this is worth getting. But if you are just starting to get your groove on, there are better options.Check outRare Funk Liberation, Vol. 1, an absolute mother overflowing end to end with classic quality."
5,Electric power mysteries explained,"This book gives clear and concise explanations of electric power fundamentals in evocative language. While I might have occasional quibbles with terminology or heuristic approach (as did one of the earlier reviewers), the book succeeds at explaining electric power concepts in ways that are far more effective than other textbooks I've used. Many very technical books on this topic are unnecessarily complex, and this book is a bridge to that more technical literature, particularly for readers who are new to the field."
2,Clearly explained in laymans' misconceptions!,"Yes, this book is indeed easy to read. However, its use of false concepts makes it an untrustworthy source. The author claims to have a degree of some sort in physics and a Phd in something. Why then does she think that an emf is a force? Any freshman physics student should know it isn't. And that bit about wriggling electrons pushing each other down a conductor-oh, brother! That is the kind of garbage I would expect in a book from Delmar Publishing, not from Wiley or IEEE press! In the preface, she mentioned receiving a manual from workers in a control room. I suspect she studied that book and forgot her physics. I have a Masters in physics, I belong to the IEEE, and I work for a major electric utility. I've seen the kind of books they use-chock full of out of date concepts and fairy tales. Come on IEEE, how did you let this book slip out?"
5,Just as advertised! Great Radios,We work at a concrete plant and find these to be great radios when dealing with all the sand water and dust. For the price you cannot find a more durable unit.Chad
5,The Return of the Serpents of Wisdom,"I thought the book was very interesting, I know Mark Pinkham and can attest to the fact that he is an honorable man.He is also a representative for the Sinclare Knights Templar in Sedona ,AZ.The book explains how we have been guided over the ages to eventually become part of the Galactic community."
2,Weird,"Couldn't finish the book. I passed the book onto someone else, who then passed it on to someone else, etc"
2,interesting,"I found this book to contain some very interesting spiritual concepts which I can learn from. Apart from that, I found that, although a great deal of information is contained with the book, it is not well written. The concepts contained within it are not well presented and can lead to confusion if one does not have a background knowledge in this area. There is also too much emphasis and time wasted on writing about the history of serpent people throughout time."
2,A bit too sparkle pony for me...,This book seems to be a little too left field for me. I found myself shaking my head at the use of obscure and abstract concepts combined with words that might not exist in most dictionaries.I was not impressed at all with this title.
2,Goes off the deep-end.,"This book is pretty one dimensional: it claims that basically all religion, all society, most royalty, and a lot more, all are related to extraterrestrial ""serpents of wisdom"" who have come to earth throughout history, and, you may have guessed it by the title, are coming back.As a serious Bible student, I personally don't doubt there is some truth to this (See Genesis 6 and the book of Enoch), but this book goes too far. Some of the claims in this book I feel went way over the deep deep-end, examples: literal part-man, part-serpent creatures actually ruled over people in the past, Jesus Christ was an ""incarnation of the serpent"" ie another serpent of wisdom, as was Buddha, Muhammad, and the other great religous leaders. Oh, did I mention, the universe was created by the primal serpent, who controls, destroys, and brings to pass the ""cycles of the serpent."" Could we be moreone-densional?"
5,Bought these for my grandson,I bought these boots for my grandson. It seems that all the boys in his school are wearing them. They fit well and he loves them.
3,Lasted 8 Months.,Please see my full review on the other location for this item. Fit great but sure didnt last as long as my old durashocks.
5,Great for 2004 Saturn Ion 2.2,"My cooling fan assembly went out on my Saturn Ion level 3, 2.2. It took 2 guys with little mechanic experience only 2 hours to remove the broken one and replace it with this. It literally *snapped* into place. It works perfectly."
4,Very Funny,I don't know what to say except that I highly recommend this for a quick laugh. I've read through it several times and laugh at each read.
1,I have not received this item.,I have nothing to compare it to altough I believe the money came out of our account and the candles never did arrive.
2,Decent candles...but wouldn't repurchase,"The candles burned steadily for over an hour without excessive wax drip. The colours were a bit melted together when they arrived, but once I separated them, they functioned ok. Unfortunately about 5 minutes into the spell a demon from the netherworld was summoned. He ate the red and blue candles, but the purple remained intact.The demon consumed my soul. Would not buy again."
2,10 Spell Candles Not Worth The Money,"I didn't give 1 star because I dont hate it. The only thing I like about it is that it comes with multi-color candles. The candles were not individualy wrapped and were stuck together and hard to pull apart in this heat wave i'm surprised they didn't melt. There is no booklet it just came with a piece of paper, also stuck to it, in a plastic ziplock bag.Some of the colors blead onto the other candles a little because they were stuck together so bad. When I tried to pull them apart the candles started to bend. Lucky for me they didn't break, but if I wanted to I could have bent it into a circle with how weak it was. IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT ON IT. THATS FO SURE."
3,ok,"When I received them as a gift, a couple of the candles were smashed and cracked. But, if I burn the wax I might be able to save the form of them."
3,Great Candles,"These are really great candles, they burn well with little wast. You can't beat the price. The only fault I could find is in the shipping charge, it's too much for what you get. I ordered 6 sets and they charged me shipping on each set. I found a better deal from the Magickal Cat on the same candles, only ONE shipping charge, aved me big bucks. But again, I found no fault with the product, only the shipping, other wise I would have to give it 5 stars!"
4,Good BUT............,"I bought these spell candles to practice candle magic. Never bought candles online before so I wasn't sure what to expect. When they came in the mail, it was neatly packaged & presented well. Nothing was broken or smashed. The colors were bright and ordinarily exactly what you see in the picture here. I am pleased with my purchase, except for one minor thing... The candles are very small. By ""small"" I mean they are No more than 3 inches in length. For the price, I wasn't expecting them to be big but I was expecting them to be bigger than what I got. Don't purchase these candles if you are doing serious craft work or magic because their burning life won't be anymore than an hour or two at most. However, for a beginner, it's a great practice candle set..... And the cliche you hear is very true btw-- ""you get what you pay for."" Think about that before making a purchase."
5,So awesome,I can use them for future spell work and it came with corrspondence table.The company Magick Net also put a business card in the package.
3,spell candles,Candles are just right for starter set. I am just learning more on wicca and these were very inexpensive to start with.
3,good for the price,"I'm overall pleased with these chime candles. I did think they would be a little bigger though, they're not meant for complicated spells or meditations. The purple one was cracked. With the candles I also received a small 3d scented triangular piece, it's dark brown, I'm not sure what it is if anyone could help?"
5,Quick,"this item shipped quickly and showed up ahead of schedule. all candles were in excellent shape with none broken, which is impressive as it seems these could break with any rough handling. Would absolutely recommend"
4,"Good price, good colour variety--bad diameter","I gave this product a 4-star because the candles are excellent: 10 candles, basic colours, affordable. Overall, these candles are wonderful. The only reason they could never reach the 5-star is because the diameter is almost half of a dime! Finding candle holders for these is very difficult. I've looked online and in a mirade of stores and could not find a holder small enough. After a couple months I just happened to stop at a garage sale and found two candle holders that would hold small candles. Just one glance and I could tell they would hold these candles so I grabbed them immediately.Sorry for the story, but yes. Great candles, have a fun time finding holders."
2,4 inches by 1/2 inch diameter,"Shipping was fine, packaging was excellent, no defects, but I give it 2 stars because the product description failed to mention the size of these. They are shorter than a bic pen and about 1.5 times the width. Given petroleum prices these days, paraffin candles will likely continue to increase in cost. I just wish I knew the size before I ordered."
5,great!,"the little candles are just sooo cute and they came with a little paper with all the different spells that they can be used for, i love them!"
5,just what I needed,these candles are just the perfect size for what I needed and arrived super fast. I would shop with Raven Moonlight again
3,Spell Candle set,"From the description that I read when ordering, I believed that the candles came with a set of simple spell information. I was a bit disappointed that it was basically just the candles in a plastic bag. The candles are lovely and a good assortment of colors but it is a little expensive to order them from online. I can get the same candles down the street without any suggested spell usage cheaper. I would encourage the makers to include at least a printed booklet with candle refernces (ie... red is sometimes used for protection, passionate issues, legal protection)."
5,Quick and pretty,These came quickly and all in one piece. I was a bit nervous about such small candles arriving through the mail in an envelope but they were of great quality. I even received a bonus incense cone. I love when a sample of other product is included in a package! I will definitely purchase these again.
3,"Works, but is not as pictured","It's about 20 little packets of plain, white thermal grease. It is not Antec branded as the product photo shows, though the packets do have the same logo on them as what is seen in teh product photo. I will add a user pic showing what you actually get."
3,Dustin hoffman is good but its all downhill form there,"Lavishly filmed, lengthy mobster drama about a declining Depression-era gangster. Critics praised the lead performance, but consider this flawed. Still, fans of high-budget historical epics and Dustin Hoffman may enjoy."
2,More of a love story,"I expected more from a movie with such a talented cast. Hoffman let me down as a villain. His acting seemed forced. He didn't pull it off well, in my opinion. Kidman was pretty good. And Billy (whoever plays him.) It's really no wonder we haven't seen much from that guy since. I wanted to see more about Billy as mafia wannabe, not Billy the love-struck sissy. They should sell this film as a romance, not a mob movie."
3,Oldie but a Goodie,"I never caught this movie when it was in the theaters. However, I did pick up the novel last month and gave it a read - pretty good, but a bit hard to follow at the beginning. So, I figured seeing the movie would be fun. Somehow watching Dustin Hoffman as Dutch Schultz didn't seem to be a great job of casting, he wasn't scary in the way the book presented him. Still a decent movie."
5,A must for Soda Stereo fans:,"This disc is a must for fans of early Soda Stereo as well as fans of their later music. You can feel the energy of Cerati's guitar solos and riffs, Bosio's bass lines, and Alberti's powerful,yet simple drumming techniques. This CD showcases 9 tracks taken from live performances in Latin America in 1987 at the height of the Argentinean band's success...This CD...is very hard to find (it is a limited edition)...If you're into live performances by this band, this CD is it. It is a much more better live CD than the band's 1998 live release from their farewell tour ""El Ultimo Concierto."" I highly recommend it."
5,...a must have,"This a delightful offering by the late Richard ""Cisco"" Murphy. The album was his first commercial release and would be an excellent addition to your collection. My favorite is ""Keystone Alley"". This track is powerful, raw but smooth and sexy. He's joined by his beautiful and talented wife Brenda who's lends her sexy voice to add balance to this wonderful ageless recording. It truly is a must have."
4,Morris' is only half right as usual!,"The premis that this could possibly be a run-off leaves me astounded.Condi should never be compared to H.Clinton.The contrast in terms of character,self confidence,morals,and actual accomplishments will always tip the scale to Condi as far as I'm concerned.Morris is selling a book,maybe!?Now pair J.D. Hayworth(R-AZ) as President with Condi Rice as VP and you have a ticket I think would save ""US"" from ourselves and the world from terrorism/illegal immigration.Put that in your ""pipe"" Dick Morris."
2,WOW,"Like putting a piece of pie on the grass at a picnic...and seeing the ants march out! This is my comment on comments, but on the book itself, this could be a classic if the author was not so obvious about his ""slant"" towards one candidate over the other. On that note...perhaps he will revise this in one year and it will be Hilary vs. McCain. Although I am not predicting the winner...and you may scoff at this matchup...Just watch!"
1,Panic on the Right,After 8 years of Bush the GOP is sweating. You don't think that women will be swelling with pride? Cheap attacks will simply backfire. If Kennedy drove Catholics to the polls in 1960 don't you think far more women will vote in 2008 than men? Do you really believe that GOP women will be voting for their guy? Or crossing over just once to vote for their gal and set a precedent in American history? Does anybody really believe that an architect of the Iraqi war policy could win an elective office? Does anybody doubt that too many women have taken the measure of Bush and reached the conclusion that they could do a better job? This book is testimony to a sea change in American political attitude. If the best candidate for the White House is a woman she will win.
1,What a great predictor of the future Morris is - NOT!,"Well, Morris hopefully feels egg on his face now... he was 100% off the mark in his predictions as to who the two major candidates would be."
2,Condi vs ?,"My interpretation of this read is that in the author's opinion it is Condi hands down. His support of Condi came shining through. I had hoped the book would offer more thought provoking points as to why this would be ""The Next Great Presidential Race."" I think a more appropriate title would have been "" Condi, The Next Great President"""
1,Waste of Time,"This book is a rally cry for the Republican faithful. I may not be a fan of Ms. Clinton, but Mr. Morris is such an admirer of Ms. Rice that he dismisses the many reasons why she would be unqualified to run for President (without ever having held an elected position beforehand). I find it astounding that Mr. Morris assumes that someone who has never run for public office and has always been appointed to positions, is nontheless the best qualified Republican candidate for the top political position. Whilst I realize it is a very appealing thought to Republicans to be able to break the stranglehold that the Democratic party has on the African-American voting block, I don't believe it is in anyone's best interest to promote any candidate without giving genuine analyses to the weaknesses of their candidacy. I recommend that you save your money and buy anything else."
3,"Highly plausible, even probable, but also ridiculously biased","What I liked about the book is it's so interesting to read. And Dick Morris has usually been proven right over the years with his predictions and analyses.I would have given the book 5 stars had Morris simply mentioned the facts about Hillary's strenghths and weaknesses, as he did with Condis, and not let his personal falling-out and subsequent dislike of the Clintons influence his comments about Hillary. Just look at the cover -- it speaks volumes: a flattering photo of Rice, an unflattering photo of Hillary.If any nonfiction book is to be accepted it must present both sides of an issue fairly. I'm no Hillary fan, but if I am going to swallow Morris' analysis whole, I need to be convinced that he has no personal axe to grind. Morris' premise may be proven correct, but how he arrived at it doesn't flatter him."
4,"Well-written analysis, but you can see the bias immediately","I know this is a book written by (at least) two people, but you can see Dick Morris' influence throughout. Here is the deal on this book. I think this is a nice analysis of the 2008 presidential race, and the issues involving these two amazing women candidates, Condi Rice and Hillary Clinton. I learned more about them, and I liked the head to head comparisons. This analysis suffers from two things, however. First, Dick Morris knows Senator Clinton much better than he knows Secretary of State Rice. That is obvious, and that influences the balance of this analysis.Second, Morris doesn't seem to like Hillary very much. This also is obvious, and affects his analysis.Nevertheless, for folks interested in these two potential (real for Clinton, possible for Rice) presidential candidates, this book will warm you up.For me, I hope both decide to run."
5,Great Recipes from Across Virginia,"This is a wonderful book loaded with recipes, pictures and Virginia history.I ahve tried many of the recipes and they are delicious. This is a great book to give as a gift to everyone you know."
1,Be careful with this product,"This product has very little documentation and as returned immediately after I tried to configure it with the base station. The LCD screen is very small and the contrast is insufficient to easily read the numbers except when a few feet directly in front of the unit. The inability to synchronize with the base station and the poor readability were killers. The lack of documentation (i.e. what channels does this use, maximum distance, etc) with the product or online was horrible.Something to be avoided unless you are a do-it-yourselfer with your own equipment to figure out what should have been in the manual."
1,"Sensor shows Celsius, not Fahrenheit .","Called La Crosse support and their reason is that they service the US and Canada, so there is no way to control which sensor you will receive. Tech support recommends that you call Amazon to see if they can somehow check it for you before ordering. This is ridicules. It's like ordering a car and not know which side the steering wheel will be since the manufacturer services both Asia and America. You might get the wheel on the left or right."
4,Does its job!,"This sensor is simple and easy to use. If you have the appropriate LaCrosse receivers, no complaints. If you can keep it out of the rain, slightly better battery life."
3,Hope it last longer,The service was excellent from Amazon as usual. I just hope this unit last longer than the first one (two years) it works well for now.
3,Transmitter,"I rated this a 3 because it reads in Celsius, and converts to Fahrenheit.When I'm out working in my yard I like to look at it and know what the Temperature is, and my head won't convert it from C to F"
4,LaCrosse temp sensor,I amj currently using this sensor for 3 different temperature units inside my house and it works great...it just needs to be put in a place that doesn't collect water. I had it on a saucer instead of on a wall (didn't want to drill into the house) and it sat in a tiny amount of water & had to buy a new sensor.
3,Is it us or the product?,"We purchased this as a replacement part. Unfortunately, it isn't providing a consistent external temperature reading like the previous unit. It's sporadic. All the internal information is fine. We have it in the same location that the old unit was, so we don't think it's a distance-to-receiver issue, but aren't sure what else may be the problem. Therefore, I can't give a complete review at this time."
3,Celsius Only,"The La Crosse TX7U unit I received has a built in display that displays in Celsius only. Fortunately when transmitted to the base it is converted to Fahrenheit. That said, no place in the Amazon ad, was there an indication I would be receiving a Celsius version of the unit. My old (broken) unit displayed in Fahrenheit and I would frequently check the temperature when I was outside on the porch. That will not now be possible unless I am ready to do a little bit of math (9*C/5+32=F). Quite annoying but not enough to send it back. As always, it arrived quickly and was in good working order other than this one issue."
3,Wrong temp setting,"There needs to be someway to decide if you get Celsius or Farhenheit. I of course got Celsius. I emailed La Crosse and there is no option to change it. You get what is sent. The temp does show up on my in house base as F, so it isn't a total loss, just can't have it outside with the unit."
5,Great sensor for main system!,I like the fact that you can mount it different ways. We have an RV and we ended up attaching it to one of our outside tables so we can move it around if we have to and we did not want to attach it permanently to the RV. It is easy to use and the readings are very accurate. This is our second sensor and we have had the main unit for at least 3 years now and are very pleased.
3,Keep it out of the rain/snow as directed.,The device works as advertised IF the directions for placement outdoors are carefully followed. I didn't the first time and it quit after getting soaked. The second one has performed as advertised and lasted: i.e. i put it out of the way of rain/snow. It's an expensive little piece of electronics so treat it with respect.
4,Srangest game I've ever played,This is not a bad game in any sense. The story line is really cruel and weird. It is a slow going game with a lot of exploring. Finding the dog strung upside down in a tortuous way was a bit shocking but saving him is a definite good point. Jennifer is by no means a master of using weapons so dodging enemies is usually easier than fighting them. The weapons are pretty basic as well and will not be much fun for the fast paced survivalist type. The only thing that I never found enough of was health supplies but managed to get through it. I am a fan of the oddball games though so Rule Of Rose was not a disappointment for me.
3,Could've been much better...,"I have mixed feelings about this game. I appreciated the simplicity of the puzzles, the neat graphics, and great music. The down sides, however, are many. The main character is, frankly, a wimp, and she moves verrryy slowly. Loading times for scene changes are WAY too long...I counted almost 30 seconds for some. Bosses can be hard to defeat simply because the main character moves so slowly and is so fragile, and it becomes frustrating to keep starting over, especially if your save point is far away. I'm still not quite sure what the actual storyline is, and aside from some expected gore, the brutality of some of the scenes bothered me. It could've been a lot better and I don't think I would pay a whole lot of money for this one again. It's definitely an interesting adventure game but I think its potential to be great was lost from the start."
2,Should Have Been a Movie...,"I admit, I haven't played a lot of survival horror. I rented this game because I thought it would be a good intro to the genre without the need to worry about twitch shooting and ammo counts. Plus, the story sounded interesting.Things didn't turn out that way. The game is SLOOOOWWWW. Action? What action? You spend your time running around through the same areas, looking for items. Sometimes you end up in combat. Mostly you run around.I use the word ""run"" loosely, since Jennifer does not seem capable of fast movement. Imagine running with your legs tied together - that's her speed. (To add insult to injury, if you make her move too much, she bends over and pants once you stop her...)On the other hand, graphics and audio are very well done."
2,"So bad, so very bad","This game is slow moving (no run ability?), there is no onscreen life meter (WTF?), no ability to target enemies, imprecise controls, terrible combat system, yet extremely well done strange & bizarre cutscenes with beautiful graphics. I can understand people loving the trailer for this game, the cutscenes really are some of the best graphics I've seen in the PS2, but this is a game, not a movie. The control & combat sections (random guys each level and boss battles) are why this is so bad and many of the combat parts you cannot avoid.This is the equivalent of a ""dumb blonde"" videogame - it looks really nice, but when you interact with it you realize it is borderline retarded."
3,"inappropriate, even for horror.","I have three things to say about this gameUncomfortable sexual overtones considering the age of the charachters. I realize that kids are not as innocent as we think, but they are not freay deaky either. Maybe this won't bother you, or maybe add to your experience, but I eventually stopped playing after the boss battle with the old man.Spectacular voice acting, graphics, and concept. Cool Idea and nice graphics. I didn't notice the voice acting at first because it blended so well.Lousy combat, eternal searches for objects that are neccesary to advance through the game. No kind of legitimate help, Ask the mop bucket guy and he usually tells you what you are asking, instead of answering. Have the dog sniff something out and he will refuse unless it is a common item. The hints in the surrounding environment and from random charachters were useless too.I was bored uncomfortable and frustrated. Not a big plus when it's supposed to be entertainment."
1,Rule of rose PS2 Game,Have not played the game. as we brought it and did not realise that it would not be compatible with NZ PS2 console.
1,False advertizing?,"The claim that this product will read email has proven false in my experience. There is no way to read outlook express or outlook. The text to speech feature will not work with anything but word ( You can forget about chat programs too ). I spent hours in thier knowlege base and found nothing useful. I suppose I could call them for a $20.00 dollar fee, but that stinks of extortion and I will not pay another penny to use a product that does not meet the claims of the author right out of the box. I will send it back and find a better way to spend $180.00."
1,Still not there,"Voice recognition is a promise, not a reality and 6.0 demonstrates this fact. It will decades before one can truely dictate to a computer. Pass this one."
2,A minimally good product that doesn't meet its claims,"I bought this product to help my visually impaired brother get better use from his computer.One of the things I wanted it to do was read his email for him. Contrary to the implication of its advertising, it doesn't read the very commonly used AOL email.It also does not allow selection of a default print size on its Dragon Pad to be increased.Dragon is also very bad about providing on-line support unless paid for. I requested help on these two items agreeing to pay; response was that the software just doesn't do these things; and goodbye.I don't know how good later versions of ViaVoice are, but an early version was certainly able to read AOL email."
3,diamond drop,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BUT I AM HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING TO PLAY AND UNDERSTAND IT IT IS OKAY
4,classic,"This is a classic feminist text, and I'm glad it's finally back it print. Although written twenty years ago, it is still incredibly relevant today. Some of the statistics she sites may be different now, but, alas, little else is. This book examines the societal values, constructs, and philospohies that oppress women, and how these values are both reflected in and reinforced by works of literature. It was her doctoral dissertation, so it is scholarly and academic, but it is still a fascinating book. This could be considered the book that started the second wave of feminism, and it is still just as important for today's feminists as it was then."
4,A good reminder,It's a very simple story with a simple message that is sometimes challenging to live. Very much enjoyed it and have purchased it for my mentee to read as well.
2,"""The Present"" Disappointing","I have previously read and enjoyed ""Who Moved My Cheese"" by Spencer Johnson, so I was anxious to read his book entitled ""The Present"". Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. He seemed to take one simple thought-""Just Enjoy Today""-and stretch it into a book, albeit a very quick read. I did not feel the content was inciteful or useful beyond the one simple statement made above, which we've all heard before. Anyone can quote a concept, but few people can make the concept workable. Johnson leaves out the ""how"" part of living in The Present by giving example after example of how everything will just be wonderful if we would just worry about today. Maybe I'm one of those people he mentions in his book...maybe I just didn't ""get it""."
5,To can change your life - change your out look,"This book has nothing new or ground breaking in it. It is a simple principle that we all grew up with. The way this story is told gives you a wakening in your life, you will put into gear that which you have known for a long time. You only have to have your heart moved by your mind. This book is remarkable in the simple fact that it is a simple fact brought to you in simple form. Easy to apply. I give away copies of this to my patients and friends and I watch the change take place. This is not a spiritual book, yet it is a practicle fact that God would love you to grasp. Practicing this Present will give you a better prepective and help you with work, home life, and even help get you through Grief. Highly Recommended! Get your Present today!"
4,"Inspiration for the Mind, Body, and Soul","One of my teachers gave me a copy of this book, shortly after I published an article in my local newspaper, I was afraid that I would not find the book interesting. When I began to read it I found it simple yet complicated all at the same time, it was a very moving book which really opened my eyes to the world, I began to live in the 'present' and pick up on all the small details that make up my own life, my own existance. It is a somewhat difficult task to live in the present and to only look into the past to learn from it, it takes time."
1,Something Old Becomes Something New,"About twenty-five years ago, Dr. Spencer Johnson wrote a book entitled THE PRECIOUS PRESENT. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but the book was kind of popular, though it wasn't a huge success. Years later, Dr. Johnson became a national sensation with his book WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? After that huge hit, publishers couldn't get enough of Dr. Johnson's writings. But what's a one or two-hit wonder to do when you've already used up your best ideas? Go back to the well and redesign something you've already written as something new.That's what happened with THE PRESENT. The ""book"" is THE PRECIOUS PRESENT retold with a few new bells and whistles. That's all. The parable-approach of the ""story"" only has one message and keeps repeating several times throughout the ""book"".At one point in the ""story"" it says of the central character that ""He was who he was"". Well, THE PRESENT is what it is and really isn't much."
2,Well worth an hour...,"I read the book sitting in a recliner rocker at Costco while my wife was shopping. It took about 55 min. from cover to cover. It's somwwhat like a car wreck. Everyone slows down to look... some pull off to the side of the road and look some more... but everyone is glad it didn't happen to them and they weren't involved. I'm glad I didn't spend ten bucks to buy it but I'm glad I read it !!!Unlike one of the other reviewers, I wouldn't buy multiple copies and give them to my kids. I'd tell them to go shopping at Costco and look for a comfortable recliner. Just one view..."
1,Annoying,"I received this item in calendar form from a friend who is into inspirational messages. I am generally not opposed to inspirational messages, but this one gets me. I tear a page off each day to humor her, but don't dare to let her know that the book gets on my nerves.We have a little boy who lives in the present and is quite happy about it until a wise old man calls his attention to the mysterious ""Present"" that he should be looking for. From then on the boy's life goes downhill. The basic problem with this book is the simplistic, annoying presentation of the one idea it possesses.Every day I tear off a page to read the newest ""installment,"" which typically tells you how much life sucks if you don't live in the present. Fortunately, the nonexistent story is occasionally interrupted by quotes from other people, which tend to be insightful.I do not recommend this book unless you want to jump out of a window. I would rate this 0 stars if the option was available."
2,The present,THE PRESENT is present now!But is to knew almost of all-men.It is a very little to learn from the book
2,customer service is horrible shipping time is worst,"i would have liked to know how long it was gonna take to get it, and when it was late i would have liked a response when i contacted them to find out why i had not received my product yet.it took a very very long time to get this and when i emailed questioning why i had not gotten my product yet (on time) they did not get back to me until a couple days later when they knew that i finally received it.after i gave bad feedback for this they called me over and over again like 5 times a day while i was at work (they even found my parents phone number somehow and called there for me) saying they wanted to give me a part refund.the money was not important, getting the part that i needed on time was very important though and that definately didnt happenif you order this dont hold your breath until you get it, you will be disappointed"
5,Making characters for your dollhouses,"Carrington is a genius in making and then teaching us to make, really ALIVE dollhouse dolls full of character. His instructions on those faces are incredible and you'll find yourself looking in the mirror checking out your own cheekbones, or frown marks, or whether or not your nose is straight. With this book, you can make dollhouse dolls with real personalities, from sweet young things to floozies, from old farmers to babies. Excellent book. Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful book,This is a wonderful book. I've started making my own figures following the instructions and have been delighted with the results. Highly recommended.
4,1/12 Scale Character Figures,"Very funny and wonderfully written. I would recommend this book to people who do any thing in art or sculpting. Mr. Carrington, makes you look at people in a new light. And you learn a lot at getting the ""perfect character"" face for your small people. The only thing I could have wished for in this book, was a few more real pictures of the model in progress. Other than that, I couldn't have asked for a better book."
3,OK,"Sound quality is good very easy to use. The main problem I had is on my sons ear did not stay on very well, nothing a little duck tape couldn't fix LOL."
4,Kids love them,"These work fine, function is great, just not very ridged. The kids love them and they are fun to use around the house."
4,Midland Earbud Speaker,"Easy to use. We used this with the Midland LXT 480 2-way radios. The range we needed was approximately 1,000 yards and it worked very well."
1,headphones,We aren't able to use these on the motorcyles at all. The radio stays keyed because of the sound of the pipes on the bike and ours aren't all that loud.
3,"Sound is fine, ear hanger is not an easy one-handed effort",Items were shipped and on time. Sound quality is great. Not as easy to hang on my ear as I would have expected. It usually takes me a minute or two using both hands to hang it on my ear securely. I would buy it again.
2,"Poor fit, poor sound, poor design, but they're cheap","This falls under ""you get what you pay for."" These are so badly designed they are barely usable. The ear clip does not hold the microphone or ear piece in a position that's useful. I purchased them for hunting, and they didn't work because you had to be speaking at relatively ""loud"" conversation volume for the mic to pick up the audio. I would give these a rating of 1 star, but they cost $13 so I probably should have guessed they would be terrible. Caveat emptor!"
2,Loose headset,While the idea is great these headsets still come loose around the ear. The ear bud has to be pushed in so tight that it eventually starts to hurt your ear. I still use mine although I would like a different style.
4,Overcoming ambient noise,"We travel in two vehicles, a diesel truck pulling a 5th wheel and a noisy jeep with a rag top. We found that using two way radios without headsets was a worthless excercise.The AVP-1 headsets work quite well and the press-to-talk button is a handy feature. We added a little foam around the mouthpiece for the jeep driver. That may not have been necessary.Well worth the price."
4,Works for us,"We use these with our GXT650 series radios. We've found these to work great as long as you bend the mic into the right spot. Make sure you're talking into the 3 little holes, not the one big one. The sound quality is better than on our Motorola radios."
4,Interested in the study of myth - Get this book!,"I love this book! It moves us past the out-dated notion of universality of myths (which always, always lost the detail of the specifics of people's narratives) and gives us a real way of approaching cross-cultural myths through a *bottom up* rather than a *top down* approach. Certainly in a time when people around the world are vocally resentful of an attempt to globalize culture, it is important to have an approach to cross-cultural myths that recognize their distinctions as well as their universalities. Doniger does a great job in balancing both."
1,Fails to find the common thread,"Although the book has a worthy goal, Doniger fails to find the glue that permeates different cultures. I suspect because her approach is to reductionist, and sex-centered, that she doesn't even factor in the common thread of spirituality."
1,JUNK-JUNK-JUNK,"Open the box, hooked up, and pulled out his home video collection to start burning to DVD- After about 30 minutes the unit froze and shut down. Several minutes later we were able to recover the VHS tape but the DVD refuses to open. The unit now refuses to power on. The unit was obviously defective and returned by someone else (writing in the owner's manual)- now we are stuck with expensive paperweight as the 90 day warranty is expired."
1,Run like the wind!,"What a piece of crap. It is so terribly difficult to operate and program. I've given up. I read the manual a couple of times to no avail. I'll play a VCR tape and try to copy it to DVD but sometimes it records a blue screen, sometimes TV and sometimes your VCR tape but you'll never know until after 2 hours of tape runs. And if you loose the remote don't even think about being able to fully control this thing with the buttons on the front. You can't even put in a DVD and press play unless the default selection when you put the movie in is ""Play Movie"".I've built my own computers, setup home automation systems. A Computer Network Engineer by trade but this thing is out of my league. My conscience doesn't allow me to resell this thing on Ebay. It would be like selling a car that you know has major problems. But I really don't think my unit is defective just the most non-intuitive piece of electronics I've ever seen."
1,This machine is just WRONG. KAPUT. NO FUNCIONA.,"I have had the machine for over a year. I think you need to take a college graduate course to understand the manual. I have read and reread it many times. We finally accomplished recording to the DVD. Forget about any onscreen help. That doesn't exist. I am usually pretty technical having a experience as an electronics technician and as a computer LAN administrator. This machine is just plain frustrating. I tried to figure out the VCR section and preprogram a channel for recording a later time. Yeah...I have to take another college course for that too. My parents were looking to buy a DVD/VCR combo. I will steer them away from a Magnavox as far I can. Please do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money on something else. However, if you want to torture yourself then you can buy this and give yourself a migraine. Anything has to be better than this machine."
3,"Works for me, not easy to use","The unit has worked for us, we've had no problems with it shutting down as many others have. The unit is quite loud, and you do have to turn the volume up to compensate for it.It is also complicated to record a dvd. It requires several steps in order to get the machine ready to record. The instruction manual does not offer much help, there are buttons and menus on the dvd player that the book does not even discuss at all, I've had the product for a couple of years and there are still menu screen which I don't what they are for.If I had to purchase another one, I don't think it would be this particular model or brand again. I gave it three stars because despite the problems and difficulty the maching did work for me."
5,Works as expected,This hinge is wider and sturdier than the one it replaced. I was concerned that the width might be a problem but it wasn't. The bolts that came with the hinge wouldn't work on my door so I re-used the ones from the existing but broken hinge. Total time spent replacing the old hinge: 5 minutes. This saved me a bunch by not having to call a garage repair company.
5,so adorable!,these curtains are exactly as they appear in the picture. we have all different color blues (even on the walls) in the room and they match perfectly. love em!
4,Really cute,Really cute. They've held up well the last year. They are exactly as advertized. I'd recommend no problem. Cute in a boys bedroom with no curtains.
2,MOS Continues to Give House Music a Bad Name,"I love to listen to these albums by Ministry of Sound just out of sheer curiousity. I'm not sure why though because I'm always certain of one thing with a MOS compilation. The album is going to be full of junk tracks. Funky House Sessions '06 encompasses MOS's love affair for anthem tracks. There are a few scattered attempts at incorporating edgier tracks on both discs which was a novel thought, but they stick out like sore thumbs amongst all the glitter-ball dance anthems. I'm still trying to figure out how they categorize their theme albums. They all have the same kind of sound, and all are compilations of really bad house music. Although, I could not bring myself to listen to this album twice, at least 1/3 of the tracks are not funky house (and those that are...are terrible), but don't worry because it does include the dance dub of ""Message in a Bottle"" by The Police! Yikes.Disc 1, 1.5/5 stars. Disc 2, 2/5 stars."
5,The ultimate house disc 2006,"This session is totally awesome! The compilation is made to lift the roof of any party, and its beautifully mixed! A MUST HAVE for any MiS fan!"
3,I Like it,This thermostat is not what I expected because the temperature rise of the car up a little account
2,Management light version,A bit light but then again I thought it may add to my MBA studies or bring additional ideas. Not much unfortunately.
2,Great Design...Built For A Dollar Store,"I chose this light/sound machine for its unique design...cd player built right in! I'm sure that's what gets most shoppers to choose this over other devices. DON'T make that mistake. Here's the short history of my Zen Master (sure to make the most highly evolved soul fly into a fit of rage): 1) Lid falls off (very hard to reattach). 2) Light glasses stop working suddenly. 3) After forgetting about the device (past warranty), I dig it out to at least make use of the c.d. player function. Even the cleanest cds start skipping or stop playing completely. 4) Come home from work to find that the adapter has heated the device to the point that it makes me wonder if it could actually start a fire.My advice: only buy a device from a company that has been a pioneer in the industry (there are a couple out there). Wish I'd have. Now I have to reincarnate again...dammit."
4,Excellent for meditation,This is a portable CD player with additional programming for light glasses. The light glasses are simply big sunglasses with little led lights stuck on the inside. I have really enjoyed using this product as it is very relaxing and helps me to meditate. I chose this light and sound machine over others because the CD player is part of the system instead of requiring a separate CD player as well.
1,not working,"I just bought this zen machine and was so excited to use it, but no matter how I try,and what button I press, nothing is working. I am so disappointed thet I paid $200 for the broken item."
1,Managing Herpes,"This book is awful. The name should be called should be called ""Sugar Coating the Bitter Pill of Herpes"" or ""Herpes; Your Sex Life Does Not Have to Change at All"" If you have herpes one should not have unprotected sex outside of marriage. This book does not endorse this practice. I realy don't understand how the so called M.D.'s that wrote this book can live with the fact that every other page of this book does not say ""If you have herpes do not have unprotected sex!!!!"". The woman who gave me herpes said there were risks but I did not have to wear a condom. This book is filled with similar propoganda. Her excusses must have come straight out of this book. ""..it can be recesive for along time, you may have already had it.."", ""..at least I told you, and I was not maliscious.."". If you care about not spreading herpes, this is book is not to be read."
4,Valuable Bible Asset,A valuable insigt to understanding difficult passages and what they mean to us in the Christian life. Easy to understand and stays with the topic without going off on allegorical tangents
4,I am amazed at how useful this is!,"Several years ago, I downloaded this as part of a Bible software program for my PC laptop, mostly because it was free. I don't remember being much impressed with it the time. Recently, after having downloaded the Kindle Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown, I started using it quite a bit. After figuring out how to access both the KJV text and the verse-by-verse commentary and reading the latter extensively, I have found it remarkably helpful, nearly always. I can only second what others here have said about its conciseness and timeless character. Especially if you are looking to buy your first Bible commentary, may I recommend this one?"
5,"Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary on the whole Bible","This book was hard to find. You were the only place that would get it for me. This is the second time you helped me get what I was looking for.Remember the word BIBLE means: ""Basic Information Before Leaving Earth"".Thanks again !Jim Bolden"
2,Very disappointing,"I was quite disappointed with both these books. As others have noted, the characterizations were disappointing, the plot seemed a bit thin ... and while they held up tolerably well for one reading, they have no re-reading value. I also found it rather appalling that the *only* female character in the books exists only to sleep with the male lead, for no reason whatsoever.As for the vampires ... bah. Badly handled and silly. Read Kurtz's Lammas Night for a real WWII occult thriller, and forget this and its sequel."
3,"Basic, but still some very useful ideas","I have been practicing for 8 years and was afraid that this book might not be useful. But since it is easy to read, I read it and am very glad that I did. It dose have some very basic information, but it also has several ideas I would not have thought of on my own. It was helpful to have the thoughts summarized and organized to give me a platform for organizing my own. And did start the wheels spinning for me to be more creative by sharing ideas that were a little different than my own. It does get bogged down in some technical detail on modems, and goes a little off tangent when it goes into stocks after a helpful discussion of retirement planning. But it gives great networking and marketing information. I wish it had a deeper section on financing the venture. But at this price, it is worth it to get some good ideas."
5,Excellent camping and TV Snack,This Jerky has an excellent flavor and is just the right mix of chewy and tough for jerky. It is a low cal way to have a snack while watching TV versus eating chips and it is easy to pack on a camping or hiking trip. I will buy it again.
5,Best Beef Jerky You Can Buy,"I love my beef jerky but there are a lot of brands out there that just don't quite cut it as far as flavor and tenderness of the jerky. But Pemmican Peppered jerky is the best jerky you can buy. Not too chewy but not to hard. It has very good flavor and I don't really think it is too salty as stated by one reviewer but I guess that's just personal taste. It's a great low fat, high protein snack. I haven't been able to find any one of my friends or family that doesn't like this brand."
3,Real bass heavy,"I liked this album when it came out, and really liked the bass it had on the album. The rappers come out as very honest and genuine. I was a real bass head fanatic at the time and turning the dial up in this album is a must."
2,It was a bomb alright...,This was an album for only their core fanbase to like--the kids who were too young to even want to pay attention to content. Absolutely horrible album. Their first one was the only good album that they have put together. They have shown maturity on this album but didn't show with their skills.Notable Tracks:Da BombAlright (Extended Version)
2,Kris Kross Is Krossing Out!,"Okay...They were a hit when they exploded with""Jump"" back in '92, but this album has no real significance. I was 10, when this came out and they hit puberty,so the album didn't generate much attention to me, except for the minor hit ""Alright""."
3,"umm, i dont know!","how many albums does kriss kross have? I havnt heard of them at all, my friend told me about them, dude R they still around? what happened to them? and whats with there clothes on backwards? and have u heard on krs one? i saw the album KRS one at a store, does that have anything to do w/kriss kross? some of these raps r good, but there 1st album is way better!"
3,A great place for the new Catholic or a Catholic who has never delved into spiritual writing,"Cameron covers some of the great Catholic classic - The Story of a Soul, Imitation of Christ, Confessions, and many others. This inexpensive book would be a nice guide for deciding what books you want tackle. Charles Lewis"
5,A collector's treasure!,"Rahul Sharma's latest album In Hope for Peace by Rhyme Records is one of the best Indian Classical Music recordings I have ever heard. Each and every little sound note can be heard distinctly in the Alaap. How wonderfully played, recorded and mixed to give us the intricate texture of Indian Classical Music. It lingers in the ears for long, long time.As I played the CD, I could almost see the valleys of Kashmir and I could hear the sound of water falls. These two CDs are collector's treasures and great meditation companions. Rahul was definitely at his best and these two recordings are certainly great achievement for Rhyme Records. And, Pandit Anindo Chatterjee's tabla is just awesome!Additionally, the skillfully designed multimedia part has some excerpts from Rahul Sharma's interview with Rhyme Records, where Rahul talks about his legendary father Pandit Shivkumar Sharma and Rahul's own musical world.Altogether it's a musical treat that no music lover should miss!"
4,One of the better albums by a folk-rock legend,"Buzzy's albums are hard to find, I consider this one of the best of the bunch. The title song is a great one and Buzzy's version of his hit ""Friends"" is on this album. ""Cheat-cheat lied"" will blow you away and ""Good face"" is a crack up."
2,Not too thrilled.,This book was required for a course. I did not find it too useful due to lack of diagrams and some poor explanation by the author. I believe this book would be great for those who have taken a inorganic course before and want to touch up on some things but for a student I do not recommend this book. Stay away!!
1,Not Worth The Money,"As a Pac-Man lover, I bought this Pinball Machine for my kids Christmas of 2005. Within a few months, it was falling apart all over the place--no rough playing I should add. It is made almost entirely of plastic. Way over priced for the product."
1,7 miles? no! 5Miles? no! 1 Mile? If your lucky,I coulnt even get 1 mile. Plain and Simple Dont waste your money. I have gotten farther range on cheap FRS Radios. The GMRS doesnt get any more range.
5,Perfect for a Green Anole,This size/wattage is perfect for our little green Anole. Gets just warm enough for him without it making the lamp too hot.
2,Burned out quickly,"I purchased a pair of these basking lamps for our aquatic turtles terrarium. The first one burned out within 10 days. So, I felt lucky that I'd purchased a second one - but it lasted less than 20 days. So, a total 30 days for 2 lamps. Maybe Zoo Med thinks that's a bargain, but I'm looking for a more reliable, long lasting product."
1,Burned out quickly,"I purchased this item based on the reviews. I used this for an aquatic turtle tank 8-10 hours per day. It burned out after a few weeks of use, although it did work well for the short time it lasted."
1,burnt out in a few weeks,I thought this item is a good replacement but I was wrong. Bulb burnt out in a few weeks. I bought this item based on good reviews but it wasn't as good as I expected.
5,Think you're a beginner? Then start here...,"I have played this instrument for over forty years...and still consider myself a ""beginner"". Why? Because even after private lessons at the University of Cinicinnati Conservatory and playing pieces which one would call ""advanced"", I still realize that some of the simplest,and most elegant, pieces are the best. Order this book without reservation and if there should be any detractors to this review, please be assured that those folks are simply ""legends in their own minds."" Learn these beautiful pieces and you will have a wonderful repertoire upon which to build. Go for it...and I look forward to your recital."
5,Golf Ball RESCUE retriever,I am very pleased with this ball retriever. Very easy to use and has great extension. Replaced my 30 year old retriever that I left on the course.
5,Smart Medicine for your Skin,"""Smart Medicine for your Skin"" written by Dr.Jeanette Jacknin is a highly readable and comprehensive book. It guides the reader in conventional and homopathic treatments with clear explanations and remedies. Detailed instruction for your hair, skin and nails, diagnosis procedures and stress reduction is a ""must"" for all who are interested in maintaining health. This is a great book."
1,BEWARE!,"These ""decals"" ARE NOT peel and stick! They are not even etched. They are only colored flames printed on glossy paper. You will end up tediously cut these out by hand and glue on by hand."
1,A Very BORING Book!,"I am 2/3 of the way through A Very Private Gentleman and find it tough going. NOTHING of note has happened yet. Why this is called a thriller, I do not understand. Once I begin a book I always finish. Otherwise I would have stopped long ago. A very big disappointment!"
4,As good as the movie but entirely different,"I read this book because I liked the movie ""The American"" with George Clooney. I was delighted to discover that there was little that the book and movie shared. What they had in common was the setting and superficial resemblances but little else. I enjoyed the leisurely pace of the book, the vivid pictures drawn of the people and the setting. The gradually increasing intensity of the action and the character's need to avoid the trap of love and a more dangerous trap. I liked the book and think it well written. Good plot and vivid descriptions of place and characters marks it as the product of a good writer."
4,The Private World of an Unusual Man,"Martin Booth takes us into the secretive world of a very private man with a secret. The beautiful Italian countryside is the backdrop for this highly intriguing story of a man in a shady profession. Our antagonist/protagonist lives a quiet life, subsidized by his unique vocation. This account will captivate and hold you until the end."
1,Disappointed,This was a so-so movie but a really crappy read. Wish I'd never started it much less finished it. Never again.
3,A very boring gentleman,"This gentleman is not only private, he's also boring. His criminal enterprises keep him from close relationships so that he not only appears to care for no one, he also doesn't allow anyone to care for him. Which also kept me from caring for him or about him. In the last half of the book he does begin to care somewhat for a young woman, and the book does improve at that point. His multi-page rants about the most mundane of subjects, however, hampered the momentum. It definitely ended much better than it started, and I found myself thinking it wasn't bad, but definitely not something I would recommend to someone else."
1,I couldn't finish it.,"I thought highly of two other Martin Booth novels: Industry of Souls and Islands of Silence. Perhaps I wasn't patient enough, but I found Booth in this novel too self consciously trying to create a fascinaing character, whom I found only boring. I am writing this review only because I couldn't find another negative review."
1,A very boring gentleman,"I seldom take the trouble to review unsatisfactory books, but I feel potential buyers should be alerted to this one. I slogged through the first fifty pages of A Very Private Gentleman in search of a story and gave up. (My wife gave up even sooner than I did, and she almost never puts aside a book she has begun.) There is not only not a story begun in the first fifth of this book, there is no hint that a story is soon to begin. What's there is a lot of very literary prose, and if that's your dish, you'll be sated. If it's not-if what you're after is a thriller-you're likely to be bored out of your mind."
1,Not worth the time to read.,I quit reading after about 20 pages or so. Seems to me the movie was much better than the book. Good thing I saw the movie first.
3,The Story Behind the Movie,"Having seen The American I found myself wanting to know more of the story. This book is well written, nicely paced storyline with just the right details. Had I read the book before seeing the movie I would have been able to create the town, the countryside, the private spaces in my head. The main character, an aristically gifted man who specializes in gun making for hire, is an unusual character. Through running narrative he shares his life. I have passed this on to others who also found the character intriguing."
3,It's an ok boat cover,"It seems like a very good material, but for $345.00, I think it could be a little more custom. The tie downs are not very good. We will keep this one but will not go with this one again in the future. I'm sure that I can find a more custom fit boat cover at the price I paid for this one."
3,Serves it's purpose,"I rec'd this item from my wish list...it serves it purpose during the holiday meal, but I wish the design was as ""crisp"" as it is on other items, such as the plates. The design is just not as nicely done on this item as it is on the plates."
3,A Nice Size and Interesting Shape,This Pfaltzgraff piece was a bit nicer than others in the pattern that I have purchased. It makes a good addition to party serving ware for the holiday season. I'd recommend watching it and purchasing when it is on sale. Definitely not for anything other than casual gatherings.
2,Brings very little to the table,If you've ever been to a bar you already have about as much information as you'll get out of this book. There's certainly more informative books out there. I'd suggest trying something other then this one.
3,Not really what I thought it would be,"This book is okay, but not really what I thought it was going to be. I was hoping for something with more recipes in it than explanations of a bartender (which I already knew).If you're looking for recipes, don't waste your money."
2,A True Disappointment!,"I bought this book because I wanted a crash course in bartending. The ratings were so good, and I hadn't found a book that catored to my need, and so I ordered this one. I was very disappointed. It is somewhat informative and easy to read book, but it falls way short as a crash course in bartending. There is a lot of useless info such as where beverages are made, etc. and not enough info on important matters for the beginner who wants to become a bartender. I would not recommend this book; as a matter of fact I returned my copy."
3,"Valve Selection Handbook, Fifth Edition: Engineering Fundamentals for Selecting the Right Valve Design for Every Industrial Flow","A little disappointing actually, particularly with regards to Ball valves and I would have thought the book would have provided a more detailed description. A modern ball valve, particulary related to the Oil & gas industry can have as many as three A4 pages for a datasheet. Whilst this book provided a reasonable overview of industrial valves, the specifications etc. and applications do not seem to be provided."
5,Style in Grace: Sterling Silver and CZ Diamond Embellished Rope Cross Pendant,"A classic design and timeless trend in jewelry fashion, this cross pendant is crafted from Rhodium Plated .925 Sterling Silver. With pave set white cubic zirconia and the intricate craftsmanship of this incredibly stylish pendant will lift your spirits and create an exclusive style for you or someone else. It's a great gift for special occasions and a valuable personal collectable. 18 inch sterling silver box chain. Very pretty."
3,Buy big. These shirts are foreign made and small.,"Cstar clothes are really nice and have a good feel to them. However, their sizing is japanese and will not fit if you buy your American size. I had to go 2-3 sizes bigger for a baggy comfortable fit to my t-shirt."
4,Me Emociona,"Inicie a escuchar la musica de Garcia a mediados de los 80 cuando la llamada revolucion del rock en español exploto (especialmente en Argentina) Gracias a una guerra que prohibio por un par de años escuchar muscia en ingles.. entiendase Argentina-Malvinas-Inglaterra, durante todo mi analisis de su obra hasta hoy dia no he palpitado de una manera tan emocionante como desde la primera vez que vi el Unplugged de Garcia en 1994, me atrevo a calificarlo quizas como el mejor Unplugged Latinomaericano en la historia de Mtv latino exceptuando por supuesto el ""Euforia"" de Paez que es agua de otro pozo ya que no se realizo con Mtv,el caso es que es un dico para gente sensilble, para gente como yo: que vivimos de ilusiones, que amamos de verdad. Le doy 4 muy buenas estrellas."
3,Charly en picada,"Album donde lastimosamente se nota visiblemente (o he de decir audiblemente) el deterioro de Charly, a raiz de su consumo de drogas. Me recuerda tanto a Syd Barrett, el fundador de Pink Floyd!El album tiene un valor historico (por eso le doy 3), pero Charly ya no tiene casi voz, y las canciones que deberian tocar las fibras mas profundas de tu ser, apenas alcanzan a moverte, tal como ocurre con la version de Dinosaurios.En una parte (eso definitivamente tiene un valor historico, aunque sea triste escucharlo asi) se le olvida la letra de la cancion que esta cantando.Definitivamente, a menos que seas un coleccionista furibundo, te recomiendo que busques el material original de Charly antes de comprar este album."
2,NO LO COMPREN!,"El problema con Charly es que sinceramente NO PUEDE cantar en vivo.Ya casi no tiene voz y tiene la maldita costumbre de hablar en medio de las canciones (no se en este disco,nunca lo escuché).Si quieren empezar a conocer a Garcia les recomiendo Piano Bar o Parte de La Religion (el mejor disco de Charly para mis oidos),los cuales muestran a un Charly extremadamente lúcido.Pero este Unplugged es decididamente una basura,aunque creo que los cd's se pueden devolver,no?"
1,"Weird Al, is that you?","When I was in Buenos Aires last year, an Argentine friend of mine, forced me to listen to Charly Garcia. I found it the most painful and hysterical musical experience. I explained this experience to another Argie friend, who almost died with laughter. Charly is the Weird Al Yankovic of South America, but somewhat serious about his music. I love Buenos Aires, the people and the culture, but no matter how much I try to find some ounce of musical pleasure, it just won't happen. This album may be suitable for children who are tired of Raffi."
4,A Thorough History,"Wendt doesn't simply give a throrough history of the Tribune, but he also goes in depth in telling of major historical events and the growth of Chicago."
5,perfect,works great! came as described. i have no complaints. & the price was much lower than I expected to find
5,Another Great Bra!,This is also one of my favorite bra's - light and firm - supportive but not binding or constrictive. I can wear it all day and not feel uncomfortable at all. The sheerness of the cups is fantastic - allows my nipples to show through and makes them more than a hint regardless of the top I'm wearing. A real eyecatcher! Get one and you'll see.
3,good but not really for miscarriage,"I found this book to be ok. It deals more with trying after a stillbirth than trying after a miscarriage. Then it goes into how to get pregnant again, which if you have tried for any length of time with your other pregnancies - you know how it works."
2,Not recommended for someone who has experienced a single loss,"I think this is a very good book for some women, but I would not recommend it for the couple who has experienced one loss and are not at greater than average risk for experiencing another. I was also dissappointed that the book did not contain very much original writing, instead it was mostly a compilation of interviews. Most of the women profiled had experienced multiple losses. I have experienced one loss and the last thing I want to imagine is going through this 3 or 4 times more! If you have experienced multiple losses, and are looking for ""honest"" rather than sugar-coated answers to your concerns, this may be the book for you. But, if you are not at a greater than average risk, and want to focus more on the positives of ""trying again,"" I would look for another book."
4,"Good, But Just One Caveat","Like the other reviewers, I agree that this book has a lot of very good information about losing a baby and trying again.However, after my 2 miscarriages I have become extremely sensitive and emotional about the issue of abortion/terminations. When I read in this book about a woman who had chosen to abort because her baby had Down's Syndrome, I felt like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. It shook me up badly and made it difficult to focus on reading (I finally just set the book aside).So, if you, like me, are very hurt by and sensitive to references to abortions, be aware that there are a few mentions of it in this book.However, if you're *not* bothered by references to abortion, I can recommend this book without reservation."
5,Excellent book,"Another of the ""big three"" of books that helped me get through the loss of my pregnancy/child a couple years ago (the other two being ""Empty Cradle, Broken Heart"" and ""Trying After a Loss""). Because there is nothing that compares to this sort of loss, it is imperative to really deal with the issues and try to move through it. This book will definitely help."
2,Only useful if you get pregnant again,"A friend just lent me her copy of ""Trying Again"". My son was stillborn at 39 weeks. No reason or explanation has been found.I would have appreciated a chapter about couples who decided NOT to try again. Or even a chapter of couples who tried again and couldn't get pregnant. Or (god forbid) couples who tried again and their next baby also died.The book talks about other books who ""gloss over"" miscarriages, stillbirths and infant deaths and yet the discussion in ""Trying Again"" is also glossing over the fact that another baby might not be in the cards for everyone.There is no easy answer for anyone who has suffered a loss."
1,cheap product,soon as i received product followed instructions rinced it out soaked in vinagar. when put in water did not know where full line wase.old ones had a line. then i was getting all kinds of wacky readings. so i compared it with my friends i noticed that the center piece in the middle of the lever was missing. i am sending it back and it probably will coast amazon more money to return it than to just tell me to deep six it. any way wont be buying this product again
4,"Good Product, Great Service!",Does a great job for the price and seems to be quite accurate. Always matches the readings on the refractrometer and the fish store.
2,Instant Ocean Hydrometer,"About the Instant Ocean Hydrometer I will give 2 stars because the measure isnt accurate, I have to make several test to get the results. I would preffer a refractemeter"
1,Reading is too high,"I bought this to compare to the previous generation of Oceanic Hydrometers. Even after breaking in, it read 0.004 higher than my old meter. This prompted me to buy a refractometer which confirmed this hydrometer consistently measures 0.002 higher than the actual salinity.This product is fine for fish, but I wouldn't recommend it for a reef / invert. tank."
1,Inaccurate,Bought this to test the water in my marine aquarium. It's way off! Said the specific gravity was 1.022 when it was actually a extreme low 1.015. Lucky for me it's a new set up and no fish yet or else I'd be out a lot more money for sure. And yes I rinsed very well before and after use.
1,mine wasn't accurate at all,"I set up a saltwater tank about 6 months ago and the LFS recommended this hydrometer to me. I was impressed with the accuracy claim so I didn't think twice about shelling out the money for it. When I started using it to check newly mixed water, I kept finding that the salinity level was lower than it should be. 1.020 instead of 1.024 that the water should have came out at. (Instant Ocean Salt Mix) I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. In the end, I discovered with a refractometer that the hydrometer isn't accurate to .001 like it claims. When the hydrometer said my water was at 1.022, the refractometer showed it to actually be 1.027. I lost several hundred dollars in fish due to this piece of junk. Yes, I did rinse it after each use and rinsed it with tank water before each test, and tested twice."
3,Unable to completely get air bubbles off,"To be accurate you need to be sure that all the air bubbles are off the swing arm. I've been unable to find a good way to do that, so have not been able to get repeatable measurements. A lot of bubbles makes the arm go to the max end of scale. That's OK, you can see the nubmer is bad right off. The trouble comes with just a few tiny air bubbles -- they give you a reasonable reading, but not an accurate one.I'll probably replace with a floating glass hydrometer."
3,Hydrometers like this are flawed,"If you get the bubbles off of the dial, it can work pretty well. I have had multiple readings from it vary quite drastically. So what I do is average a few results and throw out ugly readings."
2,Guess I'm the only one who couldn't get through it,"Love historical fiction; read it voraciously. So I guess it's no surprise that it was the scenes in the 'present day' that bored me. The whole premise of understanding some of the genius behind Rembrandt was interesting, but would have rather spent the length the book in his era."
5,Half Historical/Half Modern: All Enjoyable,"What a great, fascinating read. I couldn't put it down. A great mixture of historical fiction and a modern story with the same setting, a famous historical artist, and several mysteries. Very inventive and imaginative. Highly recommended."
4,The Bookschlepper Recommends,This two-tiered novel follows Rembrandt on an accidental (though historically hinted-at) journey to England juxtaposed with a modern descendent of his hosts. The 16th Century story is the more interesting and is well augmented with details of the time. The 20th Century story is well plotted although it is difficult to summon much sympathy for the rootless heroine. Both interweave not only the building (or restoration) of an old manor on Hull but the indecisiveness that comes when a person is outside his/her own element.
2,verbose,This is just an article from Harvard Business Review blown up into a book. Get the article reprint and save yourself time and money.
1,Don't waste your time,"I started this book with an open mind and read it in about 2 days. It is an easy read but delivers little. The Cliff Notes version, if there was one, could be summarized in 2 or 3 paragraphs. Many of the authors predictions are based on silly analogies. In the book he compares electricity to information technology. He mentions a few electrical related job titles that are no longer part of corporate America but fails to mention that there are still plenty of Electrical Engineers, Electricians, Electrical Contractors, etc. still employed in our economy. He takes a small segment of technology and predicts it's commoditization. Big Deal! Technology is ever-evolving and his predicitions are not that revolutionary. What makes this book ridiculous is his prediction that all of information technology will eventually be a commodity. This book is an obvious attempt to create a controversy to sell books. Don't fall for it. Save your money and look elsewhere."
3,Too Easy Simplistics to IT as commodity,"When we think of commodity then we think of grains,milks and minerals etc. For me example will be restaurants, everyone knows what goes in making a pizza or pasta but one makes better than other. So competitive advantages comes in executation. So if every company buys SAP or Oracle does not mean that everyone will get same benefits. It will depend on how will mix all the ingredients and that will defferenciate you from the rest. Better the ingredients(Technology, People and Process) better the results."
5,Best of Bubblegum Years,This order came quickly. The CD was packaged well. The sound quality was very good. I would recommend it to my friends.
5,great product,"Putting this on my jeep was one of the best things I've done rides smooth ,bolts right on ...and Amazom had the lowest price...."
2,"More hohum than the first book, some interesting sections","The book is less well written than the first book of the trilogy, and still suffers from poor editing from two perspectives.1) There are many abrupt scene changes where you are reading one paragraph (characters in one place), then without any transition the next paragraph starts a new scene/plot flow. Very disconcerting, and done quite a bit.2) The book is long and there are lots of lull-spots where not much happens.Both these characteristics are in Dies the Fire and The Protector's War. I didn't read the third yet, but I expect to continue with a lot of scanning over laborious or slow sections.The Protector's War - there is never a war but a bunch of skirmishes. Also I was hoping for some more concrete explanation of why the laws of physics got disrupted. There are a few pages, then it is never fully addressed."
3,A Prologue of What's to Come,"Stirling continues his detailed vision of an apocalyptic world. He shows us a little of what's going on in the rest of the world, though not much. Focused on Havel and Juniper's clans, his writing has also improved from the first. Though like the first there doesn't see any to be a major point to the story other than being a window into a small part of the world after the Change. In spite of the title, there's really not much of war going on, no more than the first book, nor do we see much of the Protector though we learn more about him. The book does seem to be a set up for the next volume, almost a prologue. The characters are interesting enough to make you want to continue the series, but hopefully a more solid storyline emerges."
3,The Change Series,This story has been done so many times already. The only thing new that S.M. brings is that fuels do not combust like they used to. Now I have not read the other reviews of these books but I assume someone else has given synopsis so this will only be my oppinion about the story. I am most of the way through the second book and though I am entertained I am not very impressed. Sterling writes well and I feel he is doing a good job with the premis(sp?)but I cant help but think all of this has been done before.
3,Simplify!,"I enjoyed ""Dies the Fire"" and looked forward to ""The Protector's War"". It has a lot of likable aspects, but the tempo overall is not good. Mr. Stirling writes more like many women authors, than an attorney. His descriptions of scenery, Wicca, Scottish rites, flowers, and the like are often inane, mind numbing, and a big turn off. It really makes the story drag at times. Simplify! Get to the point!I suspect this trilogy would have fit into one decent sized novel if Mr. Stirling focused on what is important to a reader and remembered he doesn't need to share all of his vast knowledge to put out a good story."
2,Not as good as volume #1,"I desparately wanted to love The Protector's War. I read Dies the Fire in one day and bought copies for friends. This book does not stand up to the standard set by Dies the Fire. First, Protector's War is poorly edited. The switches in time frame and perspective are poorly transitioned and disjointed. Second, there are many sections of the book when nothing happens, no characters are developed, and you are left asking, ""what's the purpose here?"" Based on my loyalty to the first book, I finished this one, but barely."
3,"good, but not great","I share the view of many of the others that have reviewed this book, but I differ on a few points. Imagine you are in his world. There is no power, no cars, no cell phones, no mall, and no tv. How many of us would fall to devout religious beliefs immediately? If you made it out of the cities alive, and met a group of people who had skills in a pre-industrial world, wouldn't you go along, if only to get fed and be protected? This is the world in which after 9 years wicca and the sca have reformed a small corner of what used to be the USA.My only question is: Is the world of ""Dies the Fire"" the one that Nantucket left, or the one that they went to?I wish he would just go back to the world of Natucket. I miss those characters."
2,I only finished this book for the sake of finishing it.,"I only finished this book because I've never not finished one after starting. This was the first (and will be the only) novel I've read of this author. I really did not enjoy his writing style. One page may cite warm, almost poetic verse trying to build an image in your mind of the surroundings - but the very next paragraph shifts to discuss some minor matter-of-fact technicality of the way a building was made.All in all the book was bi-polar. About 1/5 of the book, found in rare patches caught and held my interest. It's frustrating because the story line and characters had some promising originality and SUCH potential. But the book was poorly formatted, rarely stayed on track, and was sometimes impossible to keep track of what just happened. I finished it last night with a dissatisfied *sigh*."
3,The Protector's War,"I enjoyed the book; it remained a true sequel although I found the title to be misleading as the so-called ""Protector's War"" had not begun as of the last page - this does guarantee interest in the next novel."
3,A little Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this book and I read all of it as soon as I obtained it, but it did not capture my imagination the way ""Dies the Fire"" did. The first 10 to 12 Chapters were first rate, but I felt the whole Wiccan religion side of the story was way over done. I really liked the details in the first book about re-learning old ways, or the re-inventing of weapons and technology that would work under the new realities, but that was pretty much ignored in this book. I really liked the new English characters and how they added world wide perspective of the effects of ""The Change"" to the story. I also hated how the story ended before the premise of the title ""The Protectors War"" even started. I'm hoping the next book in the series will provide more action and adventure and do a better job of capturing the original book's magic."
2,Thinks hes Robert Jordan I guess,"At least Robert Jordan completed 9 or so books in his series before boring me to death. Mr Stirling did it in 2.As someone stated Mr. Stirling helps us understand the Protector a bit more, but 75% of this book should have been left out and the war that was promised by the title of this book should have been added.I will probably read the next book in this installment, but if its as boring as this one that will be it."
2,Enough with the Wicca!,"Enough with the silly Wicca stuff...seriously. While I am catholic my fiance is not exactly Wiccan but close (she doesn't follow any of the formal stuff, is not part of a group etc)...at any rate I felt the Wicca stuff was just silly wanna-be SCA type stuff. I told her about some of it and she said it's the stuff like that that makes her keep her mouth shut about her faith. She just finds it embaressing. I certainly do not appreciate the bashing of Christianity either - believe it or not we are not all judgemenetal Jerry Falwell watchers.Plus - it was kinda boring. I enjoyed the first one (except for the previously mentioned religious issues) but this just drrraaaggggeeeed. I will think long and hard before giving my time to the next book in the series. The Magic Time series is better."
1,Don't waste your time - There is no Protectors 'War',"Unless my book was missing a few chapters there is no war in this book. It should be titled ""Prelude to the Protectors War"", subtitled ""Buy my next book, please"". This book is nothing like the original. When I saw it in the book store I was excited. I just finished it and that excitement has turned to disgust for spending money on such a bad book.Take out the overly long descriptions of everything from war cloaks to cama lillies to leaves on a tree to every meal eaten and the book would be twenty pages at most. How many times can a persons muscles be descibed as ""whipcord""? Sometimes it felt like I was reading an old LL Bean or Banana Republic catalog.Save your self a few bucks and just re-read 'Dies the Fire'."
5,You might want to wait until the third novel is published before you start this trilogy...,"I found this novel to be very frustrating, because I should have strated reading this trilogy after the third book in the series was published. _The Protector's War_ leaves a lot of balls in the air. An excellent read, but I'm annoyed that I'll have to wait until 2006 to see how it all turns out.In some ways I like Stirling's Nantucket trilogy better. The tension between Bronze-Age cultures and the exiles from the 20th Century made for wonderful plot lines. However, Stirling has stirred up the mundane post-apocalypse world of the Willamette trilogy by adding a touch of the supernatural at the hands of the elder gods. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't think this is any less believable than the forces that changed physical constants to create ""The Change"". After all, it's all deus ex machina!"
1,Meeting at Corvallis,"The autor has alien space bats in his belfry. He casual eliminates Boyles Law of Pv+nRT which controls everything from volcanos, soda, even his bike tires. HE needs to do sientific study before he dives into this. Also how did he get ice cream with no ice Duh! His Wiccan are neo pagans and he should know a maiden is a women who is not married."
4,Another Willamette Valley viewpoint,"I, too, won't go into the plot of this book. I enjoyed both ""Dies the Fire"" and ""The Protector's War"" and have a Wiccan sister so that part doesn't drive me crazy. What does irritate me is that Stirling doesn't seem to have visited the areas that he writes about. I live about a mile from what is purported to be Crossing Tavern as Holdridge Creek crosses under Webfoot Road. No way would anyone ever build anything there as there isn't a flat spot around. Also, the plants referred to either don't exist at the seasons they are supposed to be blooming or are rare enough that they certainly wouldn't spread as fast as they would have to appear everywhere. The only thing that would take over the Willamette Valley in nine years are Himalayan blackberries--never even mentioned."
3,Tortourous Descriptions,"The book had a great story, but Stirling goes into such long tortourous descriptions of grasslands, long bows, horses, making armor, ect. He spends more time giving overlong descrptions of unimportant aspects than of important parts. I literally could skip several pages at times and not miss any of the actual story. The book has 482 pages. It could have been written in 350."
2,A lot of the same,Much slower paced than the first book and focuses a lot on descriptions of scenery. The story starts very slow but does get better as it progresses.
1,Enough Wiccan for three or four books,"The first volume in this trilogy was entertaining and interesting. This volume is godawful. The premise of a society suddenly losing electricity and other higher forms of technology is intriguing. Too bad it is overwhelmed by the completely unbelievable elements which include 1). large numbers of people becoming Wiccan and abandoning established religions, 2). people blinding following Tolkien-like ceremonies and calling people ""Lord Bear,"" and 3). the ease with which everyone is able to manufacture and master the use of swords, armor, jousting poles, etc. Halfway through the book I kept wondering when something was going to happen and dreading turning the page because yet another Wiccan ceremony or poetry was going to appear, preventing any sort of plot progression. I recommend Stirling's other books, but not this one."
4,The Change from the view of an Englishman.,The Protector's War gives us insight as to how the UK fared after the change. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't taken so long to start the story in Oregon.
4,Does anyone find it odd.....,Does anyone else find it a convenient coincidence that the Lorings sailed thousands of miles....from England to the west coast of the United States.... in a changed world where millions have died and just happened to land in the exact same place as their old pal Sam Aylward? Yet another convenient coincidence. I realize that it is fiction but believable fiction would be a little better.
4,The Protector's War,I was so happy to find The Protector's War on CD at a reasonable price. It was a bit confusing with the jumping back and forth in time but still fun to listen to while I work.
2,New Age fluff,"Unfortunately Mr Sterling uses pages and pages of nonsensical New Age fluff to make up for a rather astounding lack of inspiration.The excruciatingly detailed description of Wiccan invocations, ceremonials and what have you, far from helping any, seems rather cheap padding for a plot that is quite trivial.I do not believe I have ever read such a novel where a ride through a forest lasts three pages, a tavern brawl four pages and so on.Why such an accomplished writer as Mr Sterling should fall so low is a mystery. I suspect some editorial weasel told him: ""Pray do a a trilogy-they will buy anything you write..."".He's wrong. I won't. That's it with this writer."
1,Audio only is bad customer service.,"The bottom line is I will stop readinfg after Dies the Fire if I can't get the second book on Kindle. This is bad customer service for Amazon and not that Mr Stirling cares, the loss of a reader of his books."
1,audio only?,"heck of a thing when the author allows what is essentially a ""bridge"" novel to become a marketing tool for an audio book service. do you own the audio service or something mr stirling?just lemme read it for petes sake. (especially simce i did already in iraq in hardcover. talk about customer loyalty)"
2,Just some never ending conflicts,"Good premise, but goes on forever and loses impact. Post apocalyptic wars between good guys, bad guys, powerful and savage people. If you want a long series about groups with problems that never get solved, this is it. Stirling's writing has jumped the shark."
2,Good for beginner. Definitely not good to build your skill.,"This was my second, more expensive Stiga paddle. It is a little better than the 14.99 paddle, but not much. The ball does not seems to bounce off the paddle in the right proportion to your exerted force. Since them, I had gone on to purchase many more paddles and there are much better ones out there for about half as much. If you search hard enough, you can find a five-layer with carbon for much less or a seven-layer with carbon plus titanium mesh for only slightly more expensive.Do your homework. Search around."
4,"Amazing value, huge collection of stories",This is a vast collection of stories. Many are not so 'short' either - over 100 pages. The style is all classic London and there is a bit of a repetition in the themes. If you know White Fang or Call of the wild you will recognise these tales. But for the price you can't go wrong and it will keep you reading for a long time.
3,jack london,"some good some bad compilation of short stories, get through the early ones it gets better as you read on."
4,Love it...,"I ordered this pendant, along with a 1mm 16"" snake chain, and it arrived inside a black velvet pouch inside the shipping box. It is stamped "".925"" on the back of the pendant and on the loop that hangs from the chain. The marcasite catches the light, but blends in with the rest of the design, which is nice. My only complaint is that the long part of the ankh is fragile and I was able to bend it slightly. Something to be careful about."
4,Great book but poorly printed and without proper description.,"It should be noted that the book is split up into volume one, which is printed in the 2008 edition with the picture of the beach on the front and that volume two is printed in the 2011 edition. I wasn't expecting to need to buy both of these books in order to get the whole History of Rome. The website should have provided explanations for this. But they did not. Also, the book is essentially scanned in versions of the original reprinted here. Consequently the quality is fairly bad and not everything is legible.However, this is the best history of Rome for this age group and there is no alternative printing, so... I would buy it anyway, and did."
5,survival equipment for civil rights lawyers,"Since its publication, my little law firm has given a copy of this book to each of my law-student research clerks upon graduation. If they do follow in my footsteps and champion civil rights causes, it is indispensible survival equipment. If it has the same effect on them it did on me when I kept my nightly appointments with it in 1980, it will orient them within the history in which they will play a part, show them how hard work and careful planning can let them face powerful opponents cheerfully, and inspire them to believe that, yes, they can make a difference."
5,Amazing narrative of legal civil rights history,Better than any biography on any of the characters involved in the many cases leading up to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Dramatically will increase your understanding of civil rights history. The best legal analysis and historical depiction of the Brown decision. A compelling read.
4,Outstanding Story -- Weak on Details,"This book presents an excellent history of the struggle for civil rights in America, culminating in the NAACP victory in the Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education. The book is marred by several glaring factual errors, however."
1,Worthless to me,"I just received this DVD (Friday, Feb. 9, 2007). It turns out that it was produced by a company called St. Clair, which is famous for re-recording hit songs many years after the songs were on the charts and releasing them on compact disc. Usually, 1 or 2 of the original recording artists perform on the re-make sessions. The sound quality is usually poor and the instrumentation and singing are never as good as the original recording that you heard on the radio way back when.This St. Clair DVD is typical of that company. None of these music videos show the recording artists at the ages they were when these songs were on the charts--they are way older. And the sound quality is just as poor as on St. Clair's CDs.And, just as you'll often find on St. Clair's CDs, the artists' singing voices have degraded considerably with age--Lynn Anderson's being the most obvious here."
5,Read on!,"Having enjoyed so many of her previously published poignant short stories, I looked forward with much anticipation to reading Jean Ryan's first novel, LOST SISTER.And I was not disappointed - what a great read it was! Her acumen, wit and sensitive story-telling revealed a compelling emotional courage in confronting a journey many can relate to.LOST SISTER was a riveting and insightful novel, an excellent narrative tapestry which so wove me into its essence that I wished it could have continued on - sorry that I would be missing my new friend, Lorrie Rivers, and wishing I knew her more. I'm looking forward to future works from this talented author, Jean Ryan."
5,GREAT NEW AUTHOR!!,"I love this author's use of words, her writing style and character development. I also hope there are many more novels coming from Jean Ryan's pen! Her Lorrie Rivers character has potential for lots of great adventures, and insightful relationships. Congratulations on your first novel!"
4,Great book for facts and nostalgia!,I learned alot about the Whalers and their fans. All the highs and lows and the love they had for their team. A great book.
2,I'm sorry about this,"I love Kim Locke, but I am dissapointed with the CD. I tried really hard to love it, but its just....boring! She has a great voice; my favorite voice to come out of AI after Kelly C and Carrie. Someone here said this is what we wish Kelly's CD was. Well, not me. I love KCs CD. Its great Angry girl, Emotional girl music. This CD just doesn't make me feel anything even though she sings about some of the same themes. I really can't put my finger on it. Maybe its too safe-sounding. I don't know. I actually even removed it from my MP3 player because I kept skipping over it anyway. I'm sorry to bring down the average, but I had to tell the truth. I even like Britney's album better and I can't stand her. :-)"
5,Kimberly Locke,"I agree that Kimberly Locke is very underrated. Her voice is terrific. Why isn't she in the top 10? Love her Christmas songs. Maybe she needs more ""oldies"" - like 40s melodies?Based On A True Story"
3,"Good Music,","I had been wanting this CD for a long time and could never find it in the stores. I decided to try amazon. It was a good decision. I Love this CD. kimberly Locke is great, and the CD was delivered faster than promised and in good condition."
5,Impressed!,"I bought this cd along with Clay's latest. This cd is now one of my favorites. It's fantastic. It shows kLocke's range. The ""Supawoman"" song is great. Truly impressed. I will follow her career and purchase all future cd's by her."
3,Clueless?,"While this book was very interesting, in a sense, there wasn't enough about actual teen films. The youth culture bit was detailed and very involved, but as for the relation of this to teen films, there was only a few chapters which were really helpful. As I'm presently doing a university dissertation (10,000 wd. thesis) on youth culture and teen films, and this is one of the few books written on the topic, I of course found it useful. Though many of the ideas helped me through my work, at the same timee, I kind of finished using the book wanting more. Perhaps this is because it appears so out of date being over a decade old and as a result many of the new films entering the genre have been missed. Despite this, at the end of the day, it was useful, just not as fun as it could have been."
1,"Really Want the ""ULtimate"" Santana?","I'll keep this short and sweet... For the Ultimate Santana experience all you need are 3 albums... The First Three: Santana; Abraxas and Santana 3... everything after that is downhill, in my opinion anyway... ""Smooth"" was absolutely commercial and, the entire album for that matter, was just another ""smooth"" Clive Davis fabrication... Carlos... please come back home and record an album like the first 3 you recorded... all this other stuff is just filler..."
2,Very salty beef jerky,"I like beef jerky that's relatively tender and this jerky meets that requirement. However what they call ""teriyaki"" is in reality a soy sauce flavor. There is no sweet quality at all, so beware if you are looking for that aspect. There is 670mg of sodium in each ounce, or 28% of daily value. If you like soy sauce a lot, then this is the jerky for you. Otherwise, skip to another flavor. Would possibly give it 2 1/2 stars for good texture."
3,Unbearably Salty!,"I bought this in Aug '07 when it was on a $25 off promo.I know most commercial jerky's are too salty for my taste, but I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately this one was also. On the plus side, that caused me to eat small amounts, and less often.If you're not sensitive to salt, I'd recommend it.If it wasn't so terribly salty, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Very Salty,"This stuff is VERY salty. The flavor is good and the meat is indeed premium stuff and not any fat in it. But again, way too salty, ruin the experience. I wanted to eat more but the salt's gonna kill me. You need at least 2 glasses of water per bag of jerky to wash down the salty taste. Also, the meat is not very chewy because they cut against the grain. It would be better if they cut with the grain so you can tear off long small strips of meat and chew."
4,Sahara,"It is a fun movie to watch with lots of action. I like movies where the actors are on a quest, which this movie has."
1,not worth the money,"This book is not worth the money. The book does not cover downtown and is only broken down by hotel names. No break down of catagories such as restaurants, buffets or other items of intrest. There are much better travel books available! This book was very disappointing."
5,Perfect teapot,"This is a beautiful teapot, colors are brilliant, the infuser works really well. I have several teapots but this one is my favorite. I live alone and it is perfect for a cup or two of hot tea on these cold days."
5,Perfect!,These are exactly as described and are so tiny! They were a birthday present for a bike enthusiast and she has worn them everyday since receiving them. Sabrinasilver is also courteous and patient. Thanks for helping me!
3,Pretty good for a soundtrack,The soundtrack has more actual songs than some others. It isn't just a bunch of background music. Has the opening and ending songs from the series.
2,Not what I thought it was,"I was hopeing for the opening and ending songs, but this is just the background music for the show. It's not bad, but it's not what I was looking for."
5,Not Just Golf Balls,"The 'Search & Rescue Orange Ring Retriever' is perfect. But, my brothers and I don't use this product to retrieve golf balls! We use it to retrieve our discs while playing disc golf. Great for fishing our discs out of lakes, trees, and even fits through chain link fences, which is a great plus. As you can tell, our discs may end up anywhere, and we have saved many bucks with this great retriever. My guess, probably good for its intended use, retrieving golf balls. Solid construction! Can't go wrong with this one!!"
4,Great Way to Revive an Old Typewriter,"A few years ago, I bought a 1929 Underwood No. 5 typewriter at a local antique shop. Shortly thereafter, a friend of mine gave me a portable Underwood typewriter. I've used this product on both of them in order to loosen up the keys (especially in the second one) with great success. I imagine it would also work well on a sewing machine, but I don't have one (yet), so I can't really comment. If you're looking for a nice, effective lubricant for small metal moving parts, though, I would recommend this product."
2,not very great,"This movie was OK, but a definite letdown-I was expecting more from the special effects. I do agree, however, about the unseen spiritual realm, good and evil, that is constantly surrounding all of us, and quite often, the evil influences win out, because they're so clever; they know how to appeal to people's vanity and selfishness. I know, I used to be easily persuaded to lean toward the vain & selfish. Thankfully, the Lord Jesus blows all of that away when He shines His light in our hearts! Praise God!"
4,We purchased this to be played with the Enchanted Princess Castle.,"This was your typical ""Barbie"" style doll. My grandaughter loves it. She is 5. We bought her the Enchanted Princess Castle for Christmas and since her name is Jazmine we got the Princess Jasmine doll as part of her little collection. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition just as if you would have bought it off the shelf at a toy store. Not a great discount but it was ok at the time. (Christmas present)"
4,True Romance,"Once bitten,twice shy. The heroine gets hurt in her past relationship with a man, and when the Charming Prince exists, she is reluctant to give her heart. The story unfolds when the Charming Prince finds himself unable to fight his innder desire to be with the girl, and just want he realizes how much he really loves her instead of lust after her, a tragedy happens. Truly romantic story, and definitely one of the Miranda Lee stories that you'd love to read twice."
3,Super Reader,"Conan gets poisoned, and gets to trade sword blows with more than one demon, as well as deal with devious Vendhyans."
2,Conan the Dilluted,"Never cared for Robert Jordan's version of Conan, but maybe I'm just jaded by the fact that at book 9 of Wheel of Time I felt sorely ripped off. There are far better Conan authors than Jordan, to be sure. But, that said, this is still a fun book with decent character development and the proper ingredients of swordsplay, thievery, monsters and magic. Not a waste of your $5."
1,Horrible shlock trying hard to rip-off Robert E. Howard,"I hate this book. Robert Jordan is horrible. I love the REAL Conan stories by Robert E. Howard, and the stories completed and fleshed out by Lin Carter and L. Sprague DeCamp, who worked off of Howard's notes and outlines. Anyone else writting Conan is a hack and should not be read! Robert Jordan's sense of dialogue is cliched and plain ignorant. That wa a large part of Robert E. Howard's appeal. I am so sorry that Howard's originals are out of print and terrible tripe such as this is still out there polluting one of the greatest characters ever created."
5,Incredible Wallet,"I like to use it as a wallet, but its good as a card case too. Whether you are using it for business or just to FINALLY have a stylish men wallet, this product will fit all your needs. This is one the only online stores that sells these particular brand, so if I were you I'd act quickly!Hope this was helpful,Papa Jenkins"
5,Should have bought two!,"I wanted to go a little lighter with my wallet I was carrying and needed something for business cards as well. I have been pleasantly surprised with this card case. Since I rarely carry cash anymore, this is a very classy way to carry business cards and a credit/debit card or two - with a spot for your drivers license. I really like the item and am happy with the purchase."
4,Good but dated,"The book and methodes are very good, but it is already a bit dated, and does not match the current videos available on TI websites. Therefore it is not so easy to use the book alongside the videos as the drill are performed a bit differently and have different names."
2,Good concept but a boring read,"This book is about the interesting total immersion method. While the method itself will no doubt be effective, the book is repetitive and the same concept, i.e. that by using the method you will start to swim fishlike, is repeated over and over again making the book tiresome. Maybe just buying the DVD which is now on sale would be better!"
2,"Brilliant technique, book is poor communication, get DVD","TI has completely changed the way I swim. It is revolutionary for average swimmers.I am disappointed in the book. There is ~100 pages explaining the pros of the technique, 50 pages on the drills and the rest is interesting life experiences of the author. The drills have single pictures which is nearly impossible to figure out after the second or third drill. Naturally, you can purchase the DVD and drill cards separately. I completely understand the need to monetize knowledge but I finished the book with the feeling of one led to the well but the well was dry. Comparable books, ChiRunning has the pictures to understand the technique and Short Game Bible is well laid out with photos. I feel commercial reasons drove the shortchanging of the book.I suggest that you buy the DVD and not this book. Happy swimming."
4,Bad technique = frustrated swimmer,What a useful book! I was a swimmer in the 70's and decided to start swimming again to rehab my broken ankles. BEFORE I started doing the drills I swam for 15 minutes to test my fitness--I swam 6 laps. A month of drills and my lap counter reached 12.This is my second month of drills and I can tell that my body is gliding easier over the surface. It's still not a perfect technique but the drills have made for much more enjoyable workouts. The goal is to swim effortlessly.I wish they had color pictures with arrow indicators pointing to the key areas of the body to concentrate on a particular drill. I'd recommend that you get the Total Immersion video for freestyle to complement the book.
3,"Too many words, not enough pictures","If you can get past the hyped, rambling, infomercial style, this book can be very helpful. (The useful portion of the book could be condensed into about 50 pages.) Too much namedropping for my taste, but the drills and mental images (painted with words, notpictures) can improve your technique in the crawl. Did not live up to my expectations from all the PR."
4,You need to buy the DVD as well,"This book alone won't teach you Total Immersion Freestyle swimming. You need to buy the DVD as well. The DVD shows you how, the book tells you why. The book is wordy in places and Terry repeats the same message over and over again, but there is enough good information included to make it a worthwhile read if you are striving to improve your technique."
3,"good, but spends the first several chapters selling you","This would have made an AMAZING 40-80 page pamphlet. But I'm betting that no one felt they could sell that, so they padded it out to a book. I felt that the first half could have been summed up as ""my system works, honest"". Then we get what is honestly very useful technique, then some exercises to enable that. Then some more ""it really really works"".And it does. But I was sold when I started reading the book, I didn't need to be sold again, and again, and again.I'd imagine that the DVDs are better, given that he spends a lot of text trying to describe a motion. But I haven't seen them, so I dunno."
2,Way too long and wordy,"This book is way too long and way too wordy. It could easily be about 1/4 the size. I think the content is fine, but quite tedious to read all the babble to get to the point. Also, the book is far too light on illustrations. I recommend skipping this book and get the DVD."
2,"Too much selling, not enough info",Laughlin spends almost the entire book trying to convince the reader of why his method is useful and very little actually explaining how to do it. I agree with the reviewer who said it could have been a pamphlet.
3,Good Book if you buy Cheap,"This book is nearly 300 pages, most of which are filled with repetative ramblings from the author. If you are truly just interested in learning proper swimming techniques and don't need the author's life story, a Total Immersion infomercial, info on losing weight, or a myriad of other random items, then only approximately 50 pages of the entire book will apply to you. These 50 pages are found in chapter 8 and chapter 8 only. If you can get the book cheaply, don't bother muddling through any other part."
4,Total Immersion,"Total Immersion has really useful information and tips on how to improve your swim stroke. Even without a coach, I was able to apply a lot of the techniques."
5,Good Starting Point or Refresher,This book is a good starting point for the novice or as a refresher for seasoned swimmers looking to improve their swimming ability.
5,Totally worth it !!!!!!,This well written book is about swimming for the rest of your life. The method to swimming in a relaxed manner that requires less effort is contained in this book .Be prepared to do the drills merely reading the book will not be enough.It is obvious that the author spent years thinking about not only swimming in a better way but more importantly how to impart that knowledge.Although written the book speaks to you and takes you step by step thru the learning process within which you must immerse yourself.Mindful effort goes beyond swimming but it is a nice place to start.Kudos Terry well done !
3,NOTICE: NEW EDITION EXISTS -- MANY CHANGES,In the revised and updated edition of 2004 the drills in chapter 8 are COMPLETELY changed. Why Amazon is not selling the new edition is a mystery to me. I bought the old one here and then discovered I had to replace it.
3,Midwest triathlete,"While I am a big fan of the Total Immersion technique, the improvements that Laughlin has made in later books renders this version very obsolete. I highly recommend ""Triathlon Swimming Made Easy"". In TSME, the author starts the drills by floating on the back, not the front. Starting on the front is difficult since the author does not address proper breathing technique until later in the book. Laughlin has an excellent technique, however the drills in TSME are much better than in this book."
3,Better for theory than application.,"I am a new swimmer, with only basic knowledge and technique learned from swimming lessons. I enjoyed the first half of this book because of the theory presented and the author's passion for swimming. The second half of the book I found to be tiring. I only completed the first few workouts because they contained too much drill. I found myself leaving the pool without feeling as if I had accomplished anything. After two weeks I put this book on the shelf and got back to swimming laps."
3,More diagrams & problem solving needed,"Good theory etc, however when it comes to chapt 8 which is the practical I got stuck in the first exercise and it didn't provide information on how to get pass that, and given that one exercise builds on another if you can't get pass the first you can't get anywhere. Maybe with DVD it may become much clearer."
4,Really Good Ideas,"Book has some great ideas and techniques, but repeats a lot. The DVD ought to come bundled with it as there are too few pictures."
3,50% self-promotion; 50% an impossibly rigid series of exercises,"This book offers some good ideas but so much the text is devoted to selling itself (heck, we already bought the book!), and the key sections on the drills are hard to follow and represent a rigid series of exercises that I for one found impossible to follow past an early point. Overall, I wish I had bought a different book to help me improve my swimming technique."
1,WORTHLESS,"I have been swimming for 50 years and was hoping to get some serious explanations of the various swimming strokes to improve my technique. It is a wordy book and the point(s?) could have been made in less than one chapter. Interestingly, it is a ""long book"" but with very large type which means you get not much. There are no diagrams and just a lot of jargon to explain that one might be a better swimmer (better is defined in so many ways that I was at a loss to determine what the point of the book) is, except that in the crawl, one must actually tilt sideways to emulate fish. There was no discussion of any other swimming stroke. Charlatan is the best description. Kathy M"
2,"Too wordy, real stuff sparse","Having seen excited reviews and high rating, I decided to buy the book as well. I found that this book does NOT make an exception from ALL those pretty much useless books which offer QUICK RESULTS with LESS EFFORT.Too many tirades about ""wrong"" way of traditional swimming, ""revolutionary"" methods presented in this book, etc. But in fact, the impression is created that you don't need to work hard but just do a few exercises in this book and you can outswim people with long experience. Exercises seemed quite useless and not that ""revolutionary"" as they promised to be.Overall, valuable information is too limited. I would suggest other materials, including DVDs of USA Swimming - Swim Fast series."
2,It insists upon itself.,"If you've ever looked up an ""as seen on tv"" product online and looked for honest reviews and all you were able to find was propaganda spread around everywhere by the company in the guise of honest customer reviews, then you will recognize the tone of this book when you start reading it. All it does for 90% of each chapter is talk about how amazing his ""new"" technique is before it brushes over the basic premise of the idea. If you took out all of the fluff from this book it would be about 10 pages long. All I got from it is him telling you that you should ""swim like a fish"", be relaxed, and not work too hard. I'm sure the guy is a good coach in person, but through a book that does nothing but self promote, he's almost useless.Mind you, I only skimmed the 1st couple of chapters looking for anything useful and this was the idea that I got about this book. There are probably some good ideas in here, but you will only find them after digging through all the garbage."
1,Product not received,Commited date of delivery: 22nd Aug 2008. Today is 30th Aug 2008. Product not yet recd.
2,"Oh gee, not buying this.",Well lemme me say I have been swimming since I was 7. I am a teenager of 14 and what he says about injuries is not very much so true. Yes it is very true you use your muscles and joints but you can have an extremely high injury. I have gotten alot of injuries. I have extreme shoulder problems and my neck is horrible. He states that you have a minimal chance of getting injured and if you are you can hop right back in. I would like to inform you all that I was out of the pool for a year. A whole year and I swim for a USA team. You cannot just jump in and do what he says it takes strenght and agility. I love swimming always have yet I know that if I do not do things right I can get hurt. This goes for everyone I swim with. I do very much though think everyone should try it just do not work so hard that you get to be like me. I am young things heal but as I sit here and type I am in pain. But I would not stop swimming for the world.Thanks a friendly swimmer.
3,"Total Immersion is wordy, but effective.","This is an effective book that teaches you how improve your swimming stroke, but it could have been reduced to a 15 page pamphlet and accomplished the same goal. The author toots his own horn way too much and simply doesn't get to the point in a concise time period. I hope he reads this review so he can come out with a new no-nonsense version of the book!"
5,The Only Way To Swim,"I just finished a 1000 yard training session using the Total Immersion techniques and I feel fresh as a daisy. The book has helped me so much.I swim almost effortlessly with plenty of energy left for other training.The techniques derive from the basic idea that power comes from the trunk - hips, buttocks, abs- rather than from the arms. Using the rotary movement outlined in the book, plus learning to swim sideways so you cut a slim figure thru the water and being balanced, will get you in the water faster and, very important for us time-challenged people, out of the water faster than ever before.I used to dread the endless laps but now I look forward to them.I highly recommend the book and the video"
2,This book is a waste of time and money,"This book might be better suited to people who don't know the first thing about swimming. I've gotten to some of the explanation and drills, but honestly, this book should be about one chapter long. Time would've been better spent reading past the first page of reviews for this book, rather than buying and reading the book itself. What a letdown."
3,"Sold on Total Immersion, questionable about the drills in the book","The drills in the book didn't do much for me. I didn't buy the DVD but did see some instructional videos on YouTube. In the end, I learned more from the local TI coach in an hour than this book could do in four hours of drills. The book did give me some good background for the coach session and it is much cheaper than a personal coach, so in that sense, this is a good start if you need help with your stroke, but keep your expectations in check. Or maybe just be more patient and practice more."
5,Swimming Made Easier,"This book is very helpful for anyone who wants to improve his or her swimming skills. It is clear, direct, and well written. The method works! I recommend it, along with the other total immersion books and videos. Get it and gain confidence in the water!"
4,Updated Total Immersion,I agree with so many of the other reviewers - this book really doesnt come to life until you see a video - I am a very visual person and that is important to me. The organization of the book could use some work - but I am pleased that Laughlin is doing this work.
3,the drills from this book are obsolete,"I highly recommend this technique, however, I recently participated in a total immersion workshop and the drills have changed! They no longer teach the drills from this book. I was a little disappointed because I just bought the book a couple of months ago."
5,Great collection!,This is a great collection and I love that the case is thinner than the normal DVD case. These are movies I watch every Christmas so it was great to get them all in one collection for a decent price!
2,sad!,"Received this DVD on time for Christmas. All excited to watch Christmas vacation only to find that it kept freezing. Have not watched the other 2 yet, home that we don't have the same problem."
5,A great cpllection of classic Christmas movies!,I would definitley purchase this DVD. It is a classic collection of Christmas Comedys that all ages will enjoy! I watch all of these movies every year once the Holiday Season nears. A must have!
1,2/3 of what I asked for,Package sounded like a pretty good deal. Ordered it. No Christmas Story DVD in the box at all. And of course that's all anybody really wants. Returned.
4,For Avid Bruce Fans Only,"Like me! Get it solely for ""Growin' Up"" which left off ""MTV Plugged"" for some unknown reason."
5,cd single,"At a a value price, this cd is pure Bruce with synthesizer sounds and a great soundtrack by the modern king of rock n roll."
4,Out-dated and Adequate,"1993 Cognitive Science editions are adequate for entry-level (introductory) Cognition classed. Fortunately Professor Liston of San Jose State University recognizes this situation and accommodates learning needs and students financial capabilities. Introductory Cognition courses do not need cutting-edge/current, breakthrough textbooks. Most introductory students cannot grasp the intellectual rigor required for comprehending advanced Cognitive Science concepts, rules, standards, and philosophies.The book is in surprisingly good condition for being 18 years aged. Must have been through few 'good' owners, a few 'good' owners, or one 'excellent' owner."
1,Disappointed!,"I have ordered many things from Amazon before but I was very surprised when I tried to watch the ""What about Bob?"" DVD because it wouldnt play at all. Do I get my money back or am I just out that money??"
2,Funny- if its your kind of funny,"I didn't laugh enough give this movie any more than 2 stars. I watched it again 2yrs later and still didn't care much for it. Too bad, because I really like Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. I dont fault the actors as much as I fault the script. There are variations of humor out there; some more appealling than others. Kind of like the difference between Jay Leno and Dave Letterman's humor."
2,What about a satire with balance?,"I'm a huge fan of comedies, and I realize this movie has been strangely heralded as a ""comedy classic"" by many, but count me out. ""What About Bob?"" is unique in its attempt to satirize a relationship between a psychiatrist and his patient, but ends up beating a single gag to death for 90 minutes. Seeing Bob attempt any means possible to be with his vacationing shrink, from faking phone calls to suicide, seems out-of-place in a comedy. Watching his shrink lose patience again and again gets tiresome, who never seems to deserve the extent of torment subjected to him. Bob's favoritism, at the expense of his shrink, is a bit overloaded on the satirical edge. Overall, Bob manages to be more annoying than amusing, particularly as he alienates his poor shrink from his family and literally everyone else."
2,Most irritating comedy Murray Has Been In,"This movie was one I looked forward to watching so much I bought it without seeing it first after loving Groundhog Day so much. Big mistake, I laughed once through the entire movie, It wasn't all horrible, but that's only because of the two leading actors, Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. There was no real funny content in the movie, I mean, it was a story line that seemed to flat line after the first 15 minutes. I don't expect a comedy movie to have an outrageously great storyline, but this was simply dragging on without any unpredictable humor. It's amazing how many people do enjoy this movie, but if you haven't seen it first, don't buy it, rent it"
3,Ridiculously funny.,Watched with my family and we giggled. Entertaining but not as funny as I had remembered from 20 years earlier. Not sure why?
3,Can't give an honest review,This was a gift for my adult son who has always loved this movie and had it in VHS format. Only wish it had been available in blu ray
5,One of the Funniest movies I have ever seen,"This movie is a classic. A psych. patient, played by Bill Murray,follows his psychiatrist on his summer vacation. I could see thismovie over and over again and I'm still laughing every time thatI see it."
4,One of the best comedys ever,"What about Bob is hilarious. Its about a guy named Bob (Murray), who has a very severe case of OCD who is given a new therapist. The therapist he is given is going on vaction for a little while and Bob follows him with his fish on a bus where the passengers clap when he gets off because he is so wierd even thou his intentions are good. The therapists family loves him, but the theapist just can't stand him. He does everything to get rid of him, even putting bombs on him, but nothing works. You won't be dissappointed with this movie."
4,Hilarious,"I thought this film was hilarious, my two friends watching with me said it was pants. Bill Murray is very funny as seriously neurotic Bob and Richard Dreyfuss also very good as the increasingly desperate shrink."
5,THIS IS MY FAVOURITE COMEDY MOVIE,"This was the funniest movie I had ever seen when I first saw it. Years, and countless viewings later, it still makes me laugh.I think that this is Bill Murray's best performance.Richard Dreyfuss is a brilliant actor, and has a great talent for comedy - that voice of his was made for comedy and he is brilliant in this!A fun, original story and thoroughly hilarious!! I can't believe what I'm seeing when I see a bad review!? Have these people no funny bone whatsoever? This is an absolute comedy gem!!"
4,Some great Bill Murray moments,"When I saw this movie as a teen for the first time, I was so turned off by Dreyfuss that I couldn't enjoy any of the scenes in which he appeared. Consequently, I thought the movie stunk, and I also distinctly remember not being sold on the least on the idea that Dreyfuss has been driven to insanity in such a short period of time. He goes from annoyed to murderous without much of a transition. At the same time, it's hard to see why Dreyfuss' family keeps inviting Bob into their homes. But a years-later viewing showed that the movie definitely has the potential to grow on you; while I'm still lukewarm on Dreyfuss, Bill Murray has some of the funniest scenes of his career."
5,What About Bob?,I laughed constantly. The video is timeless in its appeal to the intelligent and nearly non - functional character of Bob and how all he really needs is a connection with others. He gloms onto his Doctor's family and displaces the successful Dr. Marvin for a short while.
5,Whsat About Bob,"The movie, ""What About Bob"", is my absolute favorite movie! I love Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss together. The storyline is quite entertaining and hillarious! I was happy to find it in a DVD form. I already have 2 copies of the movie in VHS."
4,Baby steps,"So I told the shrink I don't have a dirty mind, you're the one showing me the dirty pictures... That was a classic line in the movie"
5,Love movie! Hate that it will only go on my mobile device!,"I just bought this download for my ipod, but it doesn't work with any mobile device except Kindle Fire. Stupid me for thinking they had it available for most devices. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money because I already have it on DVD."
5,still a classic,i dont care what u ppl say about this movie its freakin hilarious .... movie was in good shape ... worked perfect in my player.... and there wasnt any editing done ....
4,Always good for a laugh.,"Great movie that is always great for a laugh. Watched it on my kindle fire hd connected to my 60"" plasma.... was a little grainy."
3,"Funny, but Better When Edited","I first saw this movie on TV, so they cut the random scenes of profanity, so I was a bit surprised and disappointed when I saw this and heard all the profanity. I definitely wouldn't recommend this as a family movie, though the profanity is limited to 4 or 5 scenes that can be skipped over.Other than that, I would've given this a higher review!"
1,"he's annoying, that's what!","I thought this might be a decent comedy, being that, Bill Murray was in it. I didn't watch it all the way through, that bad. Murray was not funny, just very annoying. I kept hoping Richard Dreyfuss, who lived near a lake, would kill Murray and dump him in the lake. That would have a least made the movie worth watching."
1,What Went Wrong With What About Bob?,"Renting this movie was one of the major video mistakes of my life. It was tedious, slow paced and terribly acted. The humor, if you can call it that, was ridiculous and the actors only made it worse. The movie seemed never ending and I almost couldn't finish it. Bill Murray was a disappointment and Richard Dreyfuss was an abomination. I am sorry that I ever saw this movie- it is certainly the worst film I have ever seen. What About Bob? Who Cares About Bob?"
1,what about Bob? DVD,"Probably OK.. looks good, arrived in good time, but I cant play it here in Australia on my ""regional"" DVD player, regards Bob Bain"
4,No one plays low key and laid back like Bill,"And he does it well in this quiet side spliting comedy. Richard is the uptight, overly sure of his psychological abilities, kind of pompus shrink who just wrote a best seller (which is what psychologist's live for). Bill is the seriously afflicted nerotic Richard inherits from another doctor trying to dump him off on an unsuspecting collegue. Richard goes away with his family for a month of vacation and Bill totally freaks out, trying every way he knows how to find out were Richard went. Bill finally finds out were they are, and shows up on Richards front step. Much to Richards chagrin, Bill's childlike quirkiness endears him to Richards family, so much so, that they practically invite him to move in. This movie is not slapstick, but very low key hilarious. Enjoy!"
3,Blast from the past,I've seen it a few times and I always enjoy seeing this movie again. Who could not like this movie?
3,Too much bad language,"This was a good movie, but had too much bad language. If it hadn't been for that, I would have given it a higher rating."
4,"Funny film, so true to life (I think)","If one has ever been in therapy (or even gotten stuck on a teacher/mentor who seems to have all the answers), he can relate to this sharp, slightly bizarre comedy. Bill Murphy was in his prime, when he could be funny and a little weird without being smarmy and overly bizarre. Richard Dreyfuss as the shrink is quintessentially his best actor self, alternately neurotic and staid in equal doses. When Murphy follows Dreyfuss to the family home -- woops, won't reveal much more than that -- some of the effects are expected (otherwise this would be a 4). I have no idea how realistic this is because I've never stalked a therapist. I imagine in real life the therapist would be loathe to call the authorities, but then Bill Murphy wouldn't have been the patient.Great weekend, rainy day rental."
5,The Dr. is in and out of his mind,"Bill Murray is at his neurotic best in this movie. His habbits would be anoying if he wasn't so darn likable and positive in a way. The ""good"" doctor is a bit shallow but as things progress you realize that if he could just relax things would have turned out like he was hoping they would. Rigid structure is a waste of time nearly all of the time, go with the flow is the take away."
5,I w ish I could rate it more than 5 stars.,"Bob Wiley is afaid of everything. But, just when he's starting to recive haelp, his pshyciatrist leaves on vacation. Now Bob is on a questfor help, as is the pshyciatrist.What about Bob? is a great comedy for people of all ages. Adult's will love the one-liners and kids will love the antics.Starring Bill Murray and Richaerd Dreyfuss.HIGHLY RECOMMENED."
1,Australia,"Again like ""Lets go to prison"" we couldn't get it to work?I hope you can resolve the problem or send something that does work in Australia."
3,3 of 5,"I'm generally amused at the thought of a person being inconspicuously annoyed by another, especially when I'm around them while they're around each other. So this comedy, about a psychiatrist who meets what quickly becomes his most exasperating patient, is best during its first half when doctor Leo is still trying, on some level, to hide his contempt for Bob. The more obvious Leo is with his behavior and the more likeable Bob becomes to everyone other than Leo, including those of us watching the movie, the less funny it all is.marcellee.com"
5,What About Bob...Too Much Fun!,"This movie was so great that I bought 4 copies, one for me, one for my best bud Dean and one for each of my therapists! My only complaint would be that Richard Dreyfuss should have gotten atleast equal billing!"
4,Hilarious!,I'm not sure why most of the ones posted here are all negative about this movie. Everyone I know absolutely loves this movie and I can't begin to tell you how many times we've watched it (along with all of our family and friends.) I'm not the type who tries to figure things out - but until I read the reviews listed on this site - I've only heard wonderful things about the movie. Its one we never grow weary of and one we have watched more times than I can count. I would highly advise this movie.
4,Contemporary comedy classic,"""What About Bob?"" is the modern day equivalent of the classic screwball comedy. It's also a first-rate hoot in itself. It plays with the age old idea of a psychiatric patient (Murray) driving his therapist (Dreyfuss) crazy. It's hard to imagine Bill Murray not being funny as most of his gestures or lines at the least raise a smile whether he's talking to his goldfish or ""baby-stepping"" through an office. Much of the comedy comes from the fact that Bob endears himself to everyone but the doctor whom Bob professes to idolise. My favourite scene is when Bob appears with Dr Marvin on a TV special praising the doctors new therapy manual. The absurd man has told us - ""It's going to do alot of good for a lot of people. I'm walking proof of that."" The comedy is strong and consistent and the stars turn in first-rate performances. Don't miss this wild and wacky ride."
3,Quick Shipping,"Seller got item to me very quickly and it was brand new with the security stickers still in tact, like indicated, but there was a piece of the case missing...?"
1,What About Bob,"I love this movie on video tape, and decided it was time to replace it with a DVD. Well, it's not the same movie. It has been heavily edited, and so the story has suffered an almost fatal injury,"
5,TOOO FUNNY,This DVD is really great.I laughed almost all the way.Good humor. I am glad that I purchased it.
4,Classic,Classic comedy and genius that are Richard Dreyfus and Bill Murray. The movie brings you right in to feel as if you're a part of the chaos! I loved it as a kid and I love it just the same as an adult! I highly recommend...
1,Cold and Unappealing,"It's hard to guess who the audience of this book could be. Lumping divergent authors between the same ""horror genre"" covers assumes a depressing blandness in taste, until you find where most of these pictures first appeared, in gossipy fanzines like Locus. Only such an audience would know Ellen Datlow for example as anything other then a competent editor, or want her picture. Gwinn is no Jill Krementz whose photography she is obviously mimicking, the only author both photographers have taken is Stephen King whose warmth Krementz captures eloquently in The Writers Desk, by contrast Gwinn's is oddly cold. This is not a good book, avoid it."
1,Not sized properly; not that good,"These are way undersized - not even close. And, they don't look that good. If you want a nice looking cashmere sweater, you'll have to pay more: this is not it. Order at least 1 size, maybe 2 sizes larger. My advice is to stay away."
3,Consider the price before ordering,"This cashmere sweater is being sold for $35, for a reason. If you've ever had cashmere from Macy's or Bloomie's or any other name-brand store for closer to $100, you know how great it can be. This is not such a sweater; if there is a grading system for cashmere, this is definitely towards the remnant/low end of the scale. But cmon, that's why it's so cheap! And yes, it does definitely run small - I'm wearing a Large right now and it's snug. Here'a another helpful hint - it sheds like crazy! Before you wear it, wash it in Woolite in the sink and let many of its little sheds go down the drain. For what it costs, it's fine. Do not give this to a sweater snob as a gift, they'll know what you're up to. But if you want a cashmere for yourself to keep you warm, it will work. Check out dept. store sale prices as well, with the seasonal changeover I got a name-brand cashmere for the same price yesterday."
4,1 Size Up,"Glad I read the views here and ordered 1 size above what I usually get, which is good for me. A great value at $34.99!"
3,Good for Beginners,"I had never owned a video camera before. This book helped me see the things I could do with it. I think I'll have this book around for a long time. If anything, it tries to cover too much in few pages. Perhaps as I get good at this, I'll understand the book better."
3,Best for Windows users.,"This is a good book for PC users. Lots of the hardware and some of the software content is not needed by Macintosh users. The photography tips are excellent for all. It is well-written with lots of attractive Windows photographs, but if you are a Mac user, you already have lots of the digital video solutions that are in the book. If you are a PC user and are really, really serious about digital video-well-it could be time for a platform change."
1,Don't bother.......,I've had to use a reacher for many years now due to arthritis and this is the worst one I have ever owned. It isnt strong enough to pick up much and the grabber part slips out of place all of the time. This is very annoying.
3,for my wife...,These do not have as strong a grip as an earlier model that she had lost. It looks identical but she has a much harder time picking things up with it.
3,Average Quality Reacher,"This is a standard basic Reacher. The Curved part of the graber and the connecting part are made of hard plastic. It will pick up medium items, but does not work for all items, expecially paper. If you want a cheap quick fix, this will work. If you need a reacher on a daily basis, you will probrobly not be happy with this one. A quality reacher will have a type of rubber type coating on the graber part, to assist in picking up all types of items. This link, is a sample, of a quality reacher:Sammons Preston Feather ReacherYes, the price is more, but you get what you pay for."
5,"great Alum Reacher 26"" - just perfect too!","just had knee replacement - and this aluminum reacher w/Magnetic tip - is definitely helping me reach for all items/things that I can not easily get to. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - GREAT PRODUCT TOO. Actually I am using the Longer 32"" inch one - and the 26"" inch one is for my 91 yr old mom, who needs the shorter length of 26"" - who needs assistance as well - BOTH GREAT PRODUCTS - and since I'm taller & and younger - the 32"" inch reacher is HELPING ME REACH - EVERYTHING HERE IN MY BEDROOM - as I drop them. Can't do without it - GREAT PRODUCT FOR ASSISTANCE - and that Magnetic tip is also helping me with metal items - BUY ONE - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! the size of 26"" or 32"" - depends on your necessity for reach levels - BUT DEFINITELY GREAT PRODUCT TO HAVE - when you need assistance in reaching - can't do without it !"
2,Great Grabber If it works\ing,"I had a total hip replacement and I ordered this reacher to help me put my clothes after surgery.I received it on Friday and Tuesday of the following week broke due to string coming untied in the reacher.String is so short that can not be tied back by hand.Called Customer Service at their location in Georgia. I Got a recording that all customer service reps were busy and someone would call me back when they came available, I am still waiting!"
3,Plastic Eventually Breaks,"I have purchased several of these over the last year. I use them for my job (I deliver mail), and they always seem to break in one of two spots: the trigger or the handle. Sometimes I will get a couple of months out of one, some times a couple of weeks. If the handle and trigger were reinforced or made with something other than plastic, I could likely use them forever. A few have popped the clamp on the rope off the end. If you can find the clamp and re-clamp it, it's fine but I had to tie a few in knots to keep them going.I'm probably not a typical users of these, but they would be a much better reacher with my suggestions. For normal people, I would recommend them."
1,"Flimsy, inferior tool","I was terribly disappointed when I received the Duro-Med Aluminum Reacher and regretted buying it unseen. It is cheaply made--lightweight aluminum, plastic, and cord. Any and all components will likely break upon frequent use. It cannot pick up anything that weighs more than a few ounces. The magnetic tip latches on to nearby objects and releasing the unwanted object is difficult. At 26 inches, it is too short to be useful. I have to bend over or stretch. I'm stuck with something that belongs in the Dollar Store but I paid $10.80."
3,handle too short does not fit on walker or wheelchair as i have to have a reacher at all times.,not a bad reacher but the handle is tooshort and not curved anough to dty on walker or wheelchair. hard to know all the details sometimes.
2,does not work well,I bought this reacher because I had a similar type that finally broke after several years of use. The problem with this reacher is that the tips do not meet properly so that small objects like coins or pieces of paper cannot be picked up very easily. I suspect the problem is poor quality control in the manufacturing rather than design.
2,"Duro-Med Aluminum Reacher, 26 inch","This reacher is to replace one that lasted six years before wearing out. In the photo, they look identical. However, when it arrived, this reacher is not made of as strong aluminum as the previous one, which makes me think it will be too flimsy to give good value. Also, there is no rubber tip to aid in securing items. I will keep it, but am disappointed in the quality."
3,Handy but not always very durable,"Since this is the most readily available reacher in our market, we've used many of them over the years. But the plastic ""trigger"" is not very durable and always breaks within a few months. The last one we bought lasted all of three months. It wasn't abused, either. The user is a very petite woman, not a body builder with a killer grip.The second most common problem they have is the string which connects the trigger to the pincher. The knot tied in the pincher eventually comes unraveled and the string gets lost in the barrel. It's very hard to fish out. Having said that, these issues are not uncommon for reachers. it's just that this brand has very uneven life in the trigger materials."
5,Aluminum Reacher,The Aluminum reacher that I purchased for my son and myself are GREAT. I am handicapped as is my son and it is hard for us to reach something from our wheelchairs if we drop things. These pick up almost everything with no trouble. I especially like the magnet on the end of the wand. Thanks for having them and I would recomend them to any one who needs help with ther reach!!
1,Items don't work,"T purchased some of your reachers, and they won't pinch together to pick an object up. Could you tell me what might be the problem? There is about an 1/2"" gap where they do not come together."
3,Nimble,"I bought this when I broke my leg. Living by myself, I didn't have anyone on hand to reach things for me.ProsLightweightNimble - seriously, I have picked up screws with this as well as other small items I thought that I'd be having to balance and reach for.ConsThe biggest complaint I have is the magnet. It's not set in so as soon as you try to pick up something heavier than the reacher itself, it comes out. Usually someplace you don't realize you have lost it. This is easily remedied by gluing the magnet in place.Tension - the band that provides the pinching action could be a little tighter. Many times when I have picked up a heavier item it has dropped the item and scissor closed.Overall, it's done what I needed. For short term use it was helpful. I might look for a better design if I had to rely on this every day."
2,Very Misleading,"I'm not even sure what happened here! The picture that is shown of the book that I purchased is NOT what arrived at my door this afternoon! What arrived is a book that I can go to any bookstore and pay $15 to $20 dollars for, not the $40 nearly $50 something that I just paid for this book. We wanted something different to have around the house, not something that looks modern. I am so angry! The stories inside are wonderful and couldn't get any better. If you don't understand what your buying when it comes to Grimm's Fairy Tales then I truly don't know what to say however, the product itself is a true disappointment and I think we will just be sending the book back and ordering a different one. I find this to be a shame too because. If there is a chance that a different book cover will be sent, the listing should say so! I was also under the impression there would be some illustrations in the book which there are not."
3,Once again the Queen of suspense got me,"This was a great book especially if you like politics!! I was suprised at every twist and turn. The main character,Pat, takes a leap of faith and moves back to the town that has an haunting background to her past. Once she is there, she is determined, as is the reader, to find what happened to her as a little girl and to her parents as well."
4,Huge Mary HIggins Clark fan,I love Mary Higgins Clark she is a very clean writter that can get your attention right form the start of the book and keep you reading all the way to the end to see how everything ties together. Stillwatch is a very good book.
2,Journalist or Propagandist?,"I have two major problems with this book. First of all, Pat Traymore is supposed to be a journalist- implying that she will be objective. Yet, throughout the book, it seems that her boss is more concerned with portraying Sen. Jennings in a positive light to sway the vice-presidential pick. If Pat is trying to influence the political system in favor of a particular candidat, then she shouldn't have been portrayed as a journalist. Mary Higgins Clark should have written her as a campaign operative.Second of all, Pat is the victim of a serious crime- stalking. Yet her boss and the Senator routinely criticize her for creating ""bad publicity"". I'm sorry is a stalking victim supposed to ignore a crime and not call the police because it might upset her boss? The attitude displayed by her boss is offensive and irrational.I usually enjoy Mary Higgins Clark's books, but this book left me frustrated and unsatisfied."
4,Stillwatch,"As Pat Traymore investigates Senator Abigail Jennings she finds more than what she was looking for! Pat embarks on a mystery that causes her to deal with her own troubled, tragic past. There are many twists and surprises in this story, a characteristic of MHC books. It's hard to put down!"
4,Another Page Turner!,"I started reading this book several years ago and for whatever reason, never finished. This time around nothing seemed familiar. Glad I kept reading because I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Also helped that the location was in my hometown and I could relate to the area. This was yet another page turner from Mary Higgins Clark. I highly recommend this book. Will definantly read more Mary Higgins Clark novels."
4,Read in one day,"In contrast to the Grisham book I had just finished that took me weeks to get through, I started and ended Stillwatch in the same day. There was never a good place to put it down. I always wanted to find out what was going to happen or to see if the person I suspected was the culprit. This book weaves a few different storylines together and although not a book destined for the classics, was a highly enjoyable read. If you're going on vacation, don't expect this one to last you the week!"
4,Stillwatch,"Stillwatch, was an exciting book to read. I enjoyed reading this book because the constant events kept my attention. Throughout the book, the main character, Pat Traymore, goes one on one with somone who doesn't wish for her to bring out old memories about the senator's past life. The amount of dedication this person goes through to prevent any information from being accessed by the public is outstanding. Other books I have read don't add up to half that of Stillwatch. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes detective novels or mysteries. I had my own opinion of who was involved with trying to stop Pat, but the book fooled me and I learned that who I thought was the perpetrator actually had no actual importance part in the book. This book was one of the best books I have read."
3,It was kind of slow and boring.,"Stillwatch had a good story to it, it was kind of slow and boring. It took a while to figure out what was going on and when I did, it wasn't that suspenseful until the end."
4,My First MHC Novel,"I picked up this book when my wife left it on my bed stand a couple of weeks ago and I started reading it out of curiousity. I was immediately drawn in by the way Higgins-Clark weaves her plot together. Her style is truly wonderful for her genre of writing. I hate giving away any plot when talking about books (though this is my first here at amazon) so all I'll say is that you better look out for the plot twists and get ready to really be sucked into the world of the protagonist.Since, my wife and I have been swapping books and I've sent some Koontz along her way and I've read another interesting work by the name of Manhook - which has been a fun read for an old corporate hack like myself *laughs*Definitely check this one out, it's made me curious to see what other works MHC has out there - if you're a first time reader or are already into her work - you won't be dissapointed."
5,Works great!,Have been using it in our home built pc for 2 years now. No problems whatsoever (haven't used the 1394 jacks). Seems well constructed. Good fit and finish.
3,short video but nice footage,"I bought this video thinking that I was going to find some old videos of Albert Einstein receiving the nobel prize or similar. However, the video is just 15 min long, of which in only one or two minutes does Einstein show up. The footage is nice though."
5,Necklace,The necklace was beautiful and came in a very nice pouch. I did not readwell or it was not clear however that the pendant was separate from a chain.
2,not completely happy...,I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad.
2,Dont expect what you see.,I bought this item for my soon to be hubby it was so small i could have just threw it in the trash.
5,wonderful,cloud be fire bird or eagle. this is big shinee. great. if you want ad to your shash of stuff.
4,make sure to add chain if you want one..,Pendant does not include chain and must be ordered seperately which is fine but wasn't clear to me at time of purchase so I was surprised when it came without one...
5,Excellent item,"I am delighted with this pendant. It is beautifully crafted and easy to wear with any necklace length. It was well packaged, and shipped at the speed of light, which was very impressive too. A pleasant shopping experience for me and I definitely plan to shop again at Silver Insanity."
3,not what I hoped,"Im an intermediate plater. the balls are not so bad, I used them for practice, and alot of balls would not bounce evenly."
2,Not worth it,"Two stars for the price, but overall these are not very good even for 1-star balls. They feel ""off"" playing; bounces are inconsistent and the speed/bounce is low.For very casual play most people won't care and this is a good deal. But if you care about getting close to the ""3-star experience"" without paying for it fully, there are better 1-star balls out there."
5,Nice,"Good size, nice bounce. Not to compare to any no brand balls. Works with my robot perfectly. Recommend to all!"
4,Be careful,"I was concerned about the height of the fan from ceiling to bottom of the light because I have low ceilings. The description of the fan on Amazon does not give the size specs (which would be VERY helpful), so I went online and looked at the fan on the Hunter website. The specs there are ALL WRONG. The fan is at least 19 inches from ceiling to bottom of the light (flush mount) according to the box it came in. The Hunter website says 7.49 inches, which I knew was wrong, so I took the largest height from their website and ordered the fan from Amazon. I had to return it--at 19 inches it would decapitate a person. Just beware of the measurements on the Hunter website--many of the fans I looked at had inaccurate measurements. Amazon did nothing wrong, except the packaging could have been better. Only one strip of tape closed each of the bottom and the top of the box. My bad for believing Hunter."

4,Cornwell Fan,"I have all but the newest book by Patricia Cornwell. I even have some duplicates, some on audio,some paperback. I like all of them. I will continue to be as I have not read one I did not like. Lucy is wild, like her character. I do not think Moreno and Garano would get along if they met."
5,lamp infocus sp 4805,very good ahf safety packeage. I have the lamp in SIX DAYS!!!!!! at my home. The lamp is very good untill now. I will suggest this e-shop to my friends. RECCOMENDED 100%.
3,"Nice fantasy, but not too interesting","This is a good fantasy book as it goes, but doesn't go very far. It was too action-packed, and didn't have the psychological/philosophical edge that made ""Philosopher's Stone"" so good."
4,Bickford is the man.,"Having read several books on the bolted joint, let me say that Bickford is the man. He's the father of bolted joint study. Don't waste your money on his other book which is a selection articles, this is the one to get.I give it 4/5 because it is very light on shear joints and could be written in a more concise manner. Also, to fully understand bolted joints, the IFI Inch Fasteners Standards book is also needed.Otherwise a totally solid intro to the bolted joint."
4,good introductory guide,"I would definitely recommend this book to beginner uke players--Mary Lou explains what you need to know to quickly get started on playing your uke and actually sound as if you know what you're doing. Her tablature is easy to follow, so as well as being able to play chords, you can also choose to play the melody line--if you have two uke players togetherone can play chords and the other melody, and together sound quite melodic. This is definitely the uke book for those with no prior knowledge of music. The songs it contains are all well known standards, and you should quickly have them mastered--and that is my only complaint really--it's so easy, it leaves you wanting more..."
4,Let the fun begin.......,"Of all musical instruments.... the one that is the most fun is also the one that is easiest to play ---- The Ukulele. In a few moments.... you can get your uke in tune, and the fun process immediately starts. You learn a bit about music... (but not enough to get in the way).. Then here sings out the melody and the chords. Before long, we're doing strums..... and everyone thinks we are a musical genius. How about that? A musical genius!Thank you, Mary Lou"
3,A Disappointment - Nothing Earthshaking Here...,"I bought this on a recommendation by a business associate. He stated that it was required reading for his employees...and there was ONE point that was particularly of interest.That one point had to be SINGLE MINDED FOCUS...and it is covered in what, 2 pages? What a waste of money.I found nothing earth-shaking, nor unique in it. And, it was a really small booklet (not a book) to command that price tag.You've heard it before by Earl Nightingale and Napoleon Hill. Save your money and get the Law of Success In 16 Lessons OR the Secret DVD. You'll get more out of them...much more."
2,Winterberry chip and dip plate,"I absolutely love the Winterberry collection. I did recieive the chip plate, but did not receive the dip bowl. It was advertised that it was,and I paid for two pieces, but the dip bowl was not included. It was just one piece."
5,exactly what i ordered,This item is just what I ordered. I was concerned the light would break during shipping but it came intact and in perfect working order. Also cheaper than my local pet store. I will always order this item online.
5,Pretty good read,Pretty good read. The story draws you in and is quite believable of the future and how space exploration due to a scientific discovery might happen. Worth trying out to see if you like it.
3,"Not what I expected, here's what this book contains","This book wasn't for me but it may be appropriate for other readers. If you like rather fussy (some would say cluttered) English style interiors, full of chintz, heavy fabrics and a strong sense of history and tradition, you may like this book. However, I was looking for suggestions and ideas for decorating with pictures in a variety of rooms, from traditional to modern to eclectic, and this book didn't meet my needs. Much of the book is devoted to pages of fine art examples and only a portion of the book shows actual rooms and ways to display artwork. You won't find ANY examples of contemporary or modern rooms or ways of displaying pictures in those rooms. However, if you'd like to see some of the finest examples of various subjects for pictures, such as dogd, architectural pictures, portraits, etc..and if you're fond of English decorating styles and traditions, you may want to take a look at this one."
4,Calculus: Early Transcendentals,It's your basic calc textbook. Covers College Calc I and Calc II (high school calc AP AB and calc AP BC). Shipper was prompt.
4,Requied texbook,It's a required textbook and it's too early in the year to evaluate content. It did arrive promptly from the vendor. The book was new as promised and a terrific value > 30% discount compared to other textbook sites.
5,Calculus Early Transcendentals Single Variable Textbook,The textbook is in very good condition and is very helpful. Good shipping. Great buy.
2,hard,"This book is so hard to understand, heck its even hard to look at. I must admit, that I haven't tried my hardest to understand this book....but then again the book is prbably the most difficult text book I have ever picked up."
1,Early Transcendentals Single Variable,"Surely Anton and publishers are lining their pockets with this one. Can I count the number of reasons NOT to buy this book! Answers only appear for the odd problems, there is insufficient documentation of the actual ""working"" of the problem, and in many instances this solutions manual shows no more than the answer that already appears in the back of the Calculus book it accompanies. Most of the students who will purchase this book can empathize with the fact that on an actual test most professors demand more than the final solution. The old adage holds .....I WANT TO SEE YOUR WORK! Take this advice Anton publishers."
1,Send the authors back to class,"Not only are the answers not worked out, some of them are wrong! Luckily I had the 4th edition solution manual, which has the answers correctly worked out. This describes the late trans. version."
1,Worst book I've ever had.,"This is by far the most awful book I've ever had to use in my life.It is written FOR people who already understand this stuff well it seems. It is nearly impossible for a person to learn using this book, let alone avoid a headache while reading even a sentence.The only thing its truly used for are the problems in it that your professor assigns. And even then, the solutions are not filled out completely (ie. no work!) and many are wrong and/or missing.And if you were unfortunate enough to have bought this book AND fail the class much like I did, it will become one of the biggest wastes of money you've ever endured. Oddly enough, I've never considered myself a bad math student.Save yourself money and time by finding a good tutor instead.In review;f(this(book)^sucks) = positive"
3,Calculus Book makes the subject harder,"I agree with a lot of the negative post. While I didn't encounter many errors in the book, I did find it hard to comprehend. It makes a hard subject even harder. Make sure you have a good professor if you take the courses."
1,Horrible Calculus Book-- Avoid at all costs,"This is the worst calculus book I have ever seen. Examples are inadequate and do not come remotely close to the difficulty of the problems at the ends of chapters. Explanations are overcomplicated. If you are using this text to teach yourself calculus, then stay away from it at all costs! (try something more legit instead, such as Thomas)...If you need this book for a class, then buy a guide to help you through the class."
4,An album that shows their musical growth...,"I ran right out and bought this on the day of release and I'm glad I did!The boys have another hit on their hands for sure. They experiemented with different supporting sounds (ie: mini-xylophone, caliope, etc), which made for an interesting listen. The material was very strong on about a quarter of the album and just ok on the remainder, thus the 4 star ranking. The musical melodies and contrasting chords are the true strength of this album. I think it best shown by the flagship song ""Born To Lead"". I played this over and over; never got tired of hearing it one time.This CD will definetly stay in my player for a while...without a doubt! Great job guys!"
2,Got the stank part down,"Being the proud owner of Hoobastank's past two cd's I was really excited to hear their new work. Unfortunately that feeling was short lived. Once I popped the cd in my cd player an annoying sample of a drill sergeant filled my car and the entire first song.The trend continued, horrible samples, bad riffs, crappy lyrics. It this Hoobastank?Well I have tried and tried to get into this cd but after a couple weeks of listening I just threw it away. I wouldn't give this cd to my worst enemy. I don't know what happened but it is not good.I realize there are allot of great reviews on this site. I don't honestly know how someone can give this cd 5 stars. I tried smoking the same stuff you were and it still didn't help!All it not lost, bundled inside this piece of doo there are a couple songs that are worth listening to. I would just download them though...save that $$$! Two stars for the two good songs!"
5,Awesome!,"It is rare that I purchase a CD and enjoy every single song. This is one of those rare times. I have listened to this so many times and I just can't get tired of it, as every song is so good. I highly recommend it."
2,not like before,i really like hoobastanks last 2 CD's but this one only had a couple good songs. i recomend just download the songs you like
5,Their best work,"hoobastank's new album ""every man for himself"" is really freakin good. every song on the album is very well put together and i think this is their best work."
4,definately not there best album to date but its alright,"definately not there best album in my opinion there self-titled is still there best album. if there were more rockers like Born To Lead, If I Were You, Inside of You, and Without a Fight, this would be a great album. If I Were You isn't a rocker but its an ok song alot better than The Reason even though its a ballad its a good pop-rock song with very good lyrics and the music video is pretty cool. This isn't my favorite album from Hoobastank but it might grow on me just like The Reason did. So in time I may update my review on this album but for now I think its a 4 star album. This album just seems to experimental to me, I like classic Hoobastank alot better but thats what new bands do and its ok if you can pull it off. Well all I can hope is they don't take another 2 1/2 years to come out with there next cd, because this cd wasn't that good for taking 2 1/2 years to make it."
5,GREAT,I thought that this was a great album. I cant stop listening to it! If you liked there other 2 get this one. You'll love it.Hey what can I say? Its Hoobastank....
1,Hooba Gone Hinky......,"Amazon didn't publish my first review because of the invective therein. Let's try again....Hoobastank, I am so disappointed. You guys completely sold out. You have no edge. You forgot your energy. You lost your interesting melodic intervals and rhythmic nuances. You made an album for the moms who told their kids to turn down the volume on your first two albums. You have emasculated yourselves. Maybe some duct tape or some staples will help for the next album...I am soooooo sorry."
1,Underwhelming Dissapointment,"These dudes went from blaring to blase without passing go. Boring, mainstream, unimaginative, emasculated, uninteresting, and other things that Amazon won't publish. They went from edgy pop-punk to Captain and Tenille. What lost potential. Sorry I waited."
1,"""The Reason"" rock music is in the @#$% hole","Sorry guys, I loved Hoobastank ever since they first came out and up until this album...but let's face it...this is trash and the only people who give this more than 3 stars are probably obsessed fanatics who beat off every time they hear ""the reason""...It's good bands like this making BAD albums like this that account for rock music being on the decline..or as I like to call it : IN THE S***HOLE!"
1,HoobaSTINK,"Very disappointed. The first two albums were amazing, Big Rock, Punk, Pop, very upbeat with tons of energy.This album is full of slower, low energy songs. Even the more rockin' songs are missing edge. My wife commented how they sound like the Backstreet Boys. I would have to agree. They seem to have turned into lifeless, commercial drivel."
2,I'm sorry I bought this album,"I LOVED the debut from Hoobastank, but this is their Mr. Roboto, and only on their second album. I don't know who produced this album, but unless you want Hoobastank to sound as wimpy as matchbox 20, you'll hate him. Why do they have a horn section on songs!!!!! This is rock, not 70's funk. A real dissapointment."
3,Three for the first single,"This will upset you, but I haven't listened to the album. (you're right, I have no right reviewing this) Three for the first single. I saw this band open for Live years ago. When I heard their very first single crawling in the dark I realized they would be big, just not this big. At least I got to see them before they were big in a small venue. I still think they sound like Incubus. You know I am right. I don't hate this band, but they are not really that innovative. They are the baby of Incubus. You like that analogy."
4,A more mature sounding Hoobastank,"After listening to this album a few times now I actually quite like it. After the first couple of listens I found it to be dull and suffering from the every song sounds the same syndrome. There are no standout songs on here, but they are catchy and lyrically good. And while the band aren't exactly outstanding musicians, Douglas Robb is a actually a very good singer with a good voice, I find his singing very pleasant on the ears.I consider myself a fan and was very satisfied by the latest album from the band. It may not be an improvement on their previous album 'the reason', but I consider it to be on par at the very least. While the album may not win any awards or be remembered and talked about in years to come, as a fan of Hoobastank I really liked it and would recommend it to all of their fans."
5,Consolidacion,"Hoobastank no tienen nada más que demostrar, y luego de este álbum mucho menos, buenos temas, fusiones, la incursiónn en la balada rock en su mejor momento y de extra el exito The reason. No les pidas más a estos chicos son demasiado buenos."
4,Moving in a good direction,"Hoobastank is close to their full potential on this disc. While never a band blessed with a huge width of musical talent or lyrical creativity , they know how to create good solid songs and I think they are close to realizing all they are composed with on this album. The album has 3 or 4 standout songs and the glue in between them have similiar sounds but enough individuality to make them worth listening to in and of themselves. The last song (More than a memory) has much Incubus mimicry, even choosing the same exotic instruments as the outra to Incubus' ""Morning View""...But this is a solid album to listen to and I'm glad to have picked it up. Thumbs down to the 2 bonus tracks after More than a memory though. Really ruins the flow of the album, and makes it feel unnaturally long. I'de suggest listening to it through a few times without them at the end"
4,Good effort but not their best,"I was eagerly anticipating EMFH since they premiered ""If I were you"" on my local radio stations. But if I were to compare this album to their self titled album and ""The Reason"" I would say it is my least favorite. Overall I still think it is a pretty good album but just not as good. First off I love Doug's voice and he uses his falsetto brilliantly in almost every song. My only problem is that the album was filled with too many ""monster ballad"" type of songs. I know that this is Hooba's bread and butter but I was expecting some harder type of songs on the album to be mixed in. I am sure they will do well financially with this album since a lot of people loved ""The Reason"" so much and will be expecting more of that style of music. And this album absolutely delivers on that. I just would have liked to see more of a mix of harder songs mixed in with all the balads like they have in their previous albums."
3,Big Disappointment,"I was extremely excited to get this CD in since their self titled album was good and the Reason album was outstanding. This album strays away from the Hoobastank sound that people love. The songs are much calmer and slower, they don't contain as much quality guitar playing. The last track, ""More than a memory"" is a big letdown because the last track from The Reason, ""Disappear"" is probably Hoobastank's best song and I was hoping the same would be the case in this CD. It seems like Hoobastank has lost their energy and sound in this CD. Hopefully they realized this and go back to their original sound for their next CD."
4,"If you like Hoobastank, you'll like it","This is the 3rd Hoobastank CD I own, and will probably be my last, only because I've essentially burned out on them. The music is solid Hoobastank, but it just sounds too familiar (like everything else they've done). I need more variety from a band, to keep the music sounding fresh, and this just doesn't deviate at all from their past formula. I've never been a big fan of their ballads - preferring their harder rocking sound - and this CD has their standard mix of heart-pouring. I realize that some folks expect/want this from them, but it's just my personal preference. That's why I still give them 4 stars. If you just want to hear more of the Hoobastank you know and love, this CD is for you."
3,A 'hits' band?,"I thought this band was the best around a couple years ago, but now I'm not as impressed. I'm giving 3 stars due to the fact it's not a bad album, but I can't help but think their best is yet to come. The Reason CD was the best one so far."
5,it was used but it works great,"i wasn't about to pay $100 from the dealership to get a new remote. i didn't care if it was used cause it was for a 2004. the only thing you have to do is call honda, give them your vin so you can get the remote with the right frequency. i know this because on my element, in 2004, they used two different remote model and i ordered the wrong one the first time."
5,it works,I ordered a replacement key fob. It came promptly. My Honda dealer service department programmed it in about 5 minutes. It works great and it is nice to have a second working key fob.
5,Scrumtrelescent!,"This DVD was absolutely brilliant. The combined acting of Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Michael Richards rivaled that of all the greatest actors of all time. The entire series is a genuine masterpiece greater even than the Mona Lisa of da Vinci and the Cistine Chapel of Michelangelo. It was so delightful, there is no word in any language genuinely superb enough to describe it, so I am forced to make one up. And I shall do so right now... This DVD was absolutely scrumptrelescent!"
4,Funny,"Another silly season of Seinfeld. I love the deleted scenes in this one. [I don't remember them being there in seasons one and two, but maybe they were] Makes me wanting season 4 now."
4,Arrived quickly,My only complaint would be that the box is a little scratched and dented up. Otherwise everything looks ok. this is a gift so i havn't actually used it yet.
5,"Yada, Yada...","Sometimes, all the ingredients are there: originality, great writing, incredible ensemble cast, equally incredible supporting cast, great cameos, topnotch production values...""Seinfeld"" is one of those moments when it's all there. And they had the class to quit at the top! Sardonic comedy at it's finest."
5,My favorite season,"I think this is the best Seinfeld Season. Episodes I loved included ""The Cafe"" (Elaine taking an IQ test for George), ""The Keys"" and ""The Truth."" There were several other terrific episodes, making this season a must buy."
2,Used- and the last disk won't play,"We bought this used. The box was a little beat up, which was fine, but then the last disc wouldn't play and it's too late to return it. Pretty frustrating."
4,Seinfeld 3 - Quick Review,"Seinfeld is one of my favorite older comedy shows. I have not seen every episode yet, but I like how the writers took time to create each character. While there are some very noticeable similarities, each main character also has differences. Great humor...fun to watch."
5,Great,"Well now that I have bought the first 2 volums and watched them all, I can say that it is amazing. The sound and picture are great. The 'Notes about Nothing' for every show is very cool, the first time I ever saw this feature. The Kramer vs. Kramer feature was so amazing, no wonder the whole cast loved Michael R. The bloopers are just great, and there are lots of them. Alot of the shows have introduction about specific shows told by the cast and production team, on how the story came about or things that happened when shooting, which is another great feature. And finally the commentaries are great. Oh yes, the fact that it is original length episodes is another great feature, it is amazing to see how much TV cuts from the reruns today. Looking forward to season 4 and up."
4,"Great story, stilted, repetitive writing","This is an eye-opening, inspirational story. The writing is repetitive and eventually the story becomes boring because of this. But don't lose sight of the fabulous story."
1,It's missing half the tracks!,"Anyone who owns the Original Broadway Cast recording knows that this CD is missing half the tracks, including some of the very best songs from Act One! I mean, what happened to When I Get My Name In Lights, Love Crazy, Only An Older Woman, Best That You Can Do, Don't Wish Too Hard, Come Save Me, Continental American, and Not the Boy Next Door? I was hoping to direct this using this CD as guide music to help my actors learn their parts but now, forget that."
2,Karaoke,Sounds okay but the backing tracks are difficult to follow and sound muddy. Wouldn't recommend it to would be karaoke singers
2,Too Many Better Choices Out There !,"There are very few books that I cannot ""gut out"" to finish reading but this is one. Sam Kapoor's review nailed it for me; although he was more generous on his ratings than myself. Follow Sam's recommnedations and you can't go wrong."
4,Digital Nature Photography,I am truly happy with this beautiful book. I love the photos the author used for demonstrate the beauty that is right there for us to enjoy. It is fairly easy to try and reproduce as well.
2,"Long on Photos, Short on Content","This slim volume is more about nature photography in general than about digital photography specifically. The images are certainly nice, but one gets the impression that this book was produced mainly to provide a gallery for the author's digital photos. The written information is rather scanty, unlike Ben Long's comprehensive ""Complete Digital Photography"" book. Although digital and conventional photography are very similar, to get the most out of digital imagery there are many differences that must be dealt with, particularly as regards processing images captured in the digital format."
5,Excellent Book,"I have never written a review about a book before, but this book is truly worth my time. I am a busy executive with a very active family. I have often wanted to take a class on digital photography, but I have never had the time. When I am reading Digital Nature Photography, I feel like Jon is right there talking to me. This book is so well written- very interesting and informative. I would recommend it to anyone!"
3,"Factual, but meandering and overly paranoid.","I am familiar with many of the cases described in the book. While the book is generally factual, it has an overall alarmist and overly paranoid tone. It jumps from case to case, suggesting connections where there are none. I was a little disappointed. Still, it could serve as a useful reference for those interested in the topic."
5,A reader,"Fialka' work is an excellent primer on yester-year industrial espionage(The book is a little out-dated). In fact, it still goes on, and it is just as it has been described by the title - it goes on silently.There are various incidents that are described in great detail about the Chinese, French, and the other ""Allies"" who constantly spy on their friends and other industrialised nations, and this book will serve as a jolting shock to anybody who runs a Company in a competitive economy.Great book, lucidly written, and highly recommended!"
1,New batter connection not good,"I found the connection on the battery to be a little off center and would not connect to the radio connections when fully inserted into the radio. If I pulled the battery out an 1/16 inch, the battery connected. I used a screw driver to re-position the battery connection plate. Shouldn't have to do that! We own 8 of these radios and all the batteries work just fine except these new ones. It is too much of a hassle to return these so I just ""fixed"" them."
4,battery review,"Pretty hard to review a replacement battery. It's made by the manufacturer, and it is the only one that works.And no doubt about it, Motorola makes quality eqiupment.The one very positive consumer element is that the pricing, service and delivery from Amazon were above reproach."
4,Just a little smaller than the 3 1/2 inch cutter...,"...and too large for the doughnut ""gems"" I hoped to make with it. My fault, not theirs. Still a useful size to make for younger kids that really don't need a full-sized doughnut, and won't be happy to get half of a larger doughnut. My boys are 13 now, so I use the 3 1/2 inch cutter a lot more often, but both are very well made and should last a lifetime."
1,flimsy,"I read reviews for a couple differnet doughnut cutters and decided on this one based on the high reviews. Unfortunately, mine came damaged. It was bent and warped. The metal is very flimsy and thin. I returned this item and I'm going to purchase a different brand."
2,Bad customer service,I called the customer service and asked how do they keep the cake/cookie fresh while shipping in such a hot weather. They answered my question with a very bad attitude. Sounds like they don't want my business.
5,Yummy Gift!,"This turned out to be the best family Christmas gift I have sent to relatives living abroad. As promised, it arrived before the 24th of December. The cookies were a sensation with adults, children and grandchildren alike. Also, they froze some of the cookie dough for a couple of months and the cookies turned out perfectly. Of course this gift ties in perfectly with the theme of Christmas, family, food and the holiday tradition of being together. They now expect this to be my Christmas gift to them every year. I have ordered these two years in a roll adn will order them again."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Ordered some VERY expensive cookies direclty form David's Cookies...Was given a delivery date 6-days in future...on 9th day--no delivery, so I emailed...on 12th day NO return email and still no delivery, so I called. Was told ""Gee...I thought that was taken care of...it will go out TODAY"" !!!! No compensaiton for this missed gift, and no offer of upgraded delivery for their shoddy handling of this order...VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not do business with them in the future."
4,Overseas cousins LOVE it!,Bought this for my little cousins overseas to help them understand where we live. Apperently their mother likes it more than them! Now they know where I'm talking about when i say we went to Central park today or the zoo. i'll be buying more for my friends children as gifts. Great book.
5,loons,great pictures and great text make this book a winner; lots of information I couldn't find elsewhere
3,A dissapointing sucess,"While this game certainly was entertaining, it was so ridden with small petty problems and mechanic issues that it diluted the entertainment to the point it felt like a lousy job and not a fun game. The main problem with this game is the incredibly huge focus on cheat/troublemaker and HITMEN! For some reason, the casino industry can only be a success for you if you send a hitman to your competitor, shoot the place up, then laugh as the fixed costs drain them into bankruptcy as the police keep the asino closed for investigation... wow fun right? Wrong, it was a terrible frustration to sit and watch an entire floor just sit there turned off over and over as you try and bleed out a competitor. My advice for anyone who wants to play a great casino game is to get Vegas Tycoon (aka Vegas Make it Big) as it is by far the best game in the genre. Following that (if you already have it) is probably Hoyle's Casino Empire, its all disgustingly downhill from there."
5,Be Careful.Making an addiction.,"I played this game in stanbul-Turkey and I loved it. You are establishing a casino,running it (which is difficult)and hiring hitmans and mafiosos....t is not repeating itself and after you play it you will look for this kind, but frankly the bad part is the sleepless nights."
2,It got boring within 3 hours.,"The game has a good idea, but theres nothing to it and after a little while its extremly boring. I wish I didn't buy this game."
4,nice effort,"From one of thre many 90's meetings of Lee Perry and British dj Mad Professor, this cd is a nice meeting of these 2 fertile minds.The results are pretty straight forward, (by Perry's standards) decent roots reggae. Perry's vocals dominate many of these tracks, and his voice is in fine form. The Dub Professor also sings some, which is an added bonus.While many other essential cds of Perry are around, this collection is a good one and showcases the meeting of 2 of dub music's great minds."
1,WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!,I bought this product from them and it turned out it was not the right thing I was looking for. When I went to returnn it they would not take it because it was open a little. So know I am out my $60 I spent on it!!!
2,Poor ergonomics,Sound quality is fine. The button to key the mike sets flush to side of fhe case which makes it extremely difficult to transmit with gloves on. I have replaced it with a unit offering easier keying.
3,A Footnote to Fundamentalism,"Mr. Kraut's writings have become something akin to collector's items for people studying Mormon fundamentalism. The information and history of seer stones are available elsewhere in better written, better researched books. But the personal, unfiltered perspective of an actual fundamentalist is the real selling point of this book. Within the polygamist culture of 20th Century Utah, Mr. Kraut became quite prolific. So again, if you want real peer-reviewed scholarship, go elsewhere. But if you've read the mainstream literature from tenured scholars, and you want to get off the beaten path of academic literature, this could be an interesting read. This book also sports some photos of actual seer stones."
2,Trac II razor,"I didn't realize this razor was plastic, it has no heft to it like the one I was replacing; very disappointed."
5,this book changed my life,"Before reading this epic novel, my life was in totaly shambles. in fact, when i wasn't loathing my existence in this universe i was usually loathing the very existence of the universe. but then this book came along. and forever altered my perception of reality. suddenly birds were singing. grass was green and growing. the once feculent sky was blue and my life fell into order from the chaos that once engulfed it. i don't use the word hero very often as it is a powerful title, but i can say without hesitation that david lanoue is the greatest american hero to ever have lived."
4,1987 sounds like yesterday,"Though simple, this seems to have aged surprisingly better than other 80's electronica. It's quite charming, alternating clever but harmless lyrical excursions with fun little synthy ditties. It's amusing how many genres this apparently encompasses. Why is this the only album Amazon has? RFS is another classic."
3,"Review of King Arthur, A Military History","The author does a good job of summarizing the situation in Britain following the withdrawl of the Romans: the threats represented by the Anglo-Saxons, Picts, and Irish are well covered. I found the discussion contrasting the Anglo-Saxon threat to Celtic Britain and the Frankish threat to Celtic Gaul very interesting.His thesis that Britain and France developed differently largely because of the relative success of the British in delaying the eventual Germanic takeover compared to the rapid collapse of native forces in Gaul seems well-reasoned.I agree with the other reviewers, however, that the chapters on the books primary subject, Arthur, are close to useless. Far too much is supposedly proved based on too little evidence. Arthur was a war leader in late 5th century Britain, almost everything beyond that is speculation and inference.Buy this book for a good, concise history of Early Britain, not for King Arthur."
1,Fantasy as history...,"This book takes on an amazing task: How did King Arthur fight his many battles and win? There are a few inherent problems here that are barely addressed by the author. #1: We don't know when Arthur lived. #2: We don't know where the battles took place. #3: We don't know anything about the size or constitution of his forces (or those of the enemy). Barring that, this book might be plausible as a reconstruction of potential military strategy and tactics in Dark Age Britain, but as an exploration of ""truth"" it is a farce."
1,They're only trying to be cool...,"Underoath sucks. While I have only heard a few of their songs off this CD, my friend assured me that they were the ""best ones"". While I am a HUGE fan of Senses Fail, I could not stand the constant screaming. It just flat out sucked. I don't see how this could be Christian, either. What do they do, scream ""I LOVE GOD"" or at the top of their lungs along with some other guy singing about his little girlfriend that stopped screwing him because he wasn't as hot as some hobo on the street in the background? Seriously. If you must try to ""fit in"" with the ""emo"" scene, listen to Senses Fail. They aren't emo though. They're way better than that."
1,Christian Screamo?!?! Gimmie a break...,"From my review title you can probably already tell that I hate this band and that piece of s**t record they so eloquently titled ""they're only chasing safety"", so if you're just another loser coming back to read your own review or support your lame a** band by marking ""no"" on every review below 3 stars, hit the bricks...But yeah, what's next, Christian Death Metal??? Christian Gothcore??? I mean, don't get me wrong, i got nothing against christian artists, but what the hell are they screaming about anyway??? Their love for Jesus???? BLAH!!!!I love you jesus BLAH!!!!!!!!I bet Jesus hates screamo too, which makes their whole crappy album moot.Okay loser, now its your turn to push the ""no"" button. Happy trails..."
1,SOOOO HEEVY AN AWWSUME!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1,DIS ALBOOM IZ SOO HEEVY AN HAZ SOOOO MUCH PASSUION!!! DEY R CHRISTIAN SO DAYT MAKES DEM RELLY INTARASTING!!! DEY SING PREETIFUL SONGS DAT HAV MEENINGFUL LIRICS!!! DA GATARIST IZ SO AWESUM AN HES SO MUCH BETTA DEN KERRI KING OR ADREAN SMITH!!! DA VOCALIST SCREEMS SO GOOD AN BETTA DAN CHUCK SCHULDINER OR MIKEEL ANKARFIELD!!! BUY DIS HEEVY ALBOOM NOW!!! UNDEROATH R SOOOO AWESUM!!!
1,this is not underoath!,"First of all i would like to say that underoath doesn't existed anymore...They haven changed their sound when they released the boring & stupid album changin of times and they just got worse.Now, they turn screamo and they try copying off bands like taking back sunday, alixesonfire, and,coheed &cambria which just do not work at all because they are not suppost to sound like that in the first place! For good underoath get cries of the past & act of depressing but do not buy either changin of times or this new terrible album called their only chasing safety. F*ck underoath their a rip-off made band, ugh!"
1,This sounds like taking back sunday...,"First of all, the sound is DEFINATELY NOT Underoath. I understand bands trying to mature and whatnot... but it sounds to me that Underoath is changing their sound to fit in with the current trends and make money off of 13 year olds.If you're looking for the Underoath on Act of Depression, Cries of the Past or even The Changing of Times, this is NOT the same thing.In conclusion, if you're into generic crap... buy this. Otherwise, don't waste your money"
4,BE THE LOVE,"guys, seriously, GET OVER IT! The band has changed, now the only original member is aaron the ranga, thus I declare that this is completely different band, this is the NEW underoath, and yes, they sound different, but how could they not? the OLD underoath is OLD (stating the obvious there) and so is the music. embrace the underoath revolution. be the love. this is a cleaner sound. they play as a band, not as individuals with conflicting sound. see, they have this thing called harmony now..."
4,"Sellout? Maybe. Talented, maybe.","Nobody can say they know why underoath 360'd their style. I wish I did because I wish the old ways were still alive. I feel as if I've been cheated out of future underoath albums. Their new style appeals to trendy mtv fans who love to be hip. If you love sellout punk and alternative you'll like this, but you'll never truly love the way underoath used to be. If you loved the old ways, you'll be very disappointed with the new move. I'm embarrassed to wear my old underoath stuff. Sad move."
4,Listen to the Real Review....,"This CD is very good, as the previous ones by Underoath. The vocals/lyrics are urgent and empowering. The guitars crunch over perfect drum patterns. High points are ""boy who painted town red"" and ""reinventing your exit"". Highly recomended to just kick ass and play as loud as possible in your stereo. See there was no bashing or calling people retards."
3,eh...,"Let me first start of by saying that this is a good cd. but it is a disappointment because it sounds absolutely nothing like their last album. i heard a few songs from their new album and i couldnt believe it was underoath. they have changed their sound way too much. on Changing of Times, you hear alot more keys, almost making it dancecore-ish. They turned the keys down by alot and there is nothing to separate them from every other ""scream/hardcore"" band out there. but this cd is still good. its not great because it doesnt really have anything special so i would suggest burning it from a friend and buy changing of times."
4,Listen up!,"A few people have been saying things about the new lead singer and how awful he is live. I will be the first one to tell you that yes he WAS awful live, but man oh man i have seen him live on more than just a few occasions and i will tell ya'll that he improves every single show. And for some that think lyrically this isnt the greatest CD because of him, just wait till their next album! This Cd kicks!"
3,"It;s okay, but......","First of all, don't let the dude who said ""This is a Christian band"" scare you off. Never once have I listened to them and went, ""You know, their a Christian band."" They might be christians, and a band, but I don't see them as a Christian band.I loved the ""The Changing of times"". Tons of bands release crap everyday especially in the hardcore genre and that album was a standout. It towered over the truck loads of crap that was released in 02.But with a new singer, a new sound for the new disc.....well it's nice and all, but doesn't really do it for me like the Changing of times. I could feel the passion in that TCOT and I don't feel the same in TOCS. I feel they could have done better but oh well, maybe next time."
3,Sounds like...,"I dont know if its just me but the vocals in this sound almost exactly like Bert from the used in certain songs and I find that to be a let down. whats the point of listening to it if its basically just like another band. i mean, i heard ""young and aspring"" without knowing who it was and i seriously got up and was like ""holy sh*t! the used have a new song."" thats how much it sounds like Bert. the screaming, the singing, all of it. id have to say if you want that sound, go pick up the used's first album and then after that go get their second. this cd is still damn good tho. dont get me wrong. i just think it sounds too much like the used."
1,Pathetic!,What happened to this band? What happened to the raw extremely heavy and some of the best riffs i've ever heard from any band black metal in Cries of the past? Their Changing of times album sucked but this is by far the worst! I don't understand how they can release a heavy bm album then shrink down into a [...] emo band. very dissapointing
1,Jesus and rock,"ALOT of bands claim to be Christian to play labels and some claim it for the glory. Some Christian bands start of writing about Jesus (like POD and MXPX) and sell out completely.Then there are those who have Christian members but just want to write tunes about everything. Being Christian in a rock and roll worl can sometimes be like playing with fire cause you always have people breating down your neck. Expecially if a band member is seen doing something not so Godly (like Sonnie from POD saying curse words at Ozzfest) people are bound to jump on that and say ""thats not so Christian now is it!"" while wearing a Marilyn Manson shirt.Bands out there do have Christian members but try to keep the whole religious thing at a low for reasons like this."
1,Coolest thing since Stryper!,"Banal, trite, unoriginal, and lame. All these descriptive words come to mind when hearing Underoath. Why is it that suddenly its become trendy to jump around like idiots, screaming like a congregation of drunken monkeys, and making a lot of repetitive, talentless, and pointless noise all in the name of a guy who has been dead for over 2,000 years? I expect the next time I pass a church on Sunday morning to hear the pastor banging on a bunch of pots and pans and screaming out his sermon to his enthralled audience in a lame attempt to appeal to the younger generation. I guess this is one band you can rock out with Jesus to.Keep music evil."
2,i miss the old underoath...,"this is an OK cd, but comparing to their old stuff it's kind of dissapointing...this ISN'T the amazing underoath we all knew...where has the desperate screams to God gone?...they just changed, but in my opinion not for the best. if you wanna try the real underoath get hold of the 3 cds before this one."
1,If you like emo...,"If you like emo you MIGHt like this cd. If you like hardcore, dont even bother. The guitars and drums are so pop-punkish it makes me want to puke! The vocalist has a good emo voice, but he screams for no reason, and there is nothing to back it up. It sounds empty instead of aggressive. The bottom line: Emo fans, try it. As for me, i want quality hardcore, and this just isn't it."
4,Good CD,"I say buy it. Yes the band has changed, most bands grow and progress and their sound changes. I think they've gotten better. Now they seem a bit more organized and ""together"". The music definitley rocks, well put together, with some catchy parts thrown in there."
5,Awesome CD,Underoath has come back with a great cd definatly superb.This cd is very hard and has great tunes and lyrics. def a must buy!!
1,Where did all the metal go?,"When i became a fan of Underoath a couple years ago, I was drawn to them by their heavy songs and original sounding keyboards. It created a different experience from the rest of the metal, hardcore, and emo out there. Well they got a new singer and it seems like they completly lost their identity. Now they sound exactly like every other screamo band out there. Track 2 is hideous because you can tell the some of the lyrics in it are trying to appeal to 13 year old girls. The music itself is so bland and nothing at all stands out. The vocals seem to be the main focus. Underoath probably figured they will gain new fans by taking this route, but they also lost alot of fans too."
5,Good...and not so good...,"Underoath happens to be one of my favorite bands...I would have to admit that their past releases are much better with the older singer that they used to have. Chamberlain (the new singer) happens to be okay and give Underoath a new taste, but I'd prefer to buy their other albums if you want more screaming and ""torture""."
2,...,"Q: What exactly is Underoath doing now that any other hardcore band with emo influences isn't?A: Nothing.Thier prior cd ""Changing of Times"" was decent, though wasn't quite as great as the old stuff on Takehold Records. I had hopes from the cool cover (though, they should have made the picture with the girl's eyes closed the front, and the one with her eyes open the inside picture) that Underoath would improve on CoTs, but I was sadly disappointed. A few songs were nice enough, but only track six did anything that made me happy."
2,Under written,"The cd has great sound quality. That said, it's fairly easy to write music that is not going to sound all jumbled or may be at such a strict tempo that it's more interesting. I believe the band has the talent to explore a more modern style with their talent using less formatted song structure. Anyone who can play power chords could be in the band, another way of saying that is the guitar players lack their own style making ability that other bands guitarists' are known for."
2,This is not Underoath,"I like Underoath, but this album just doesn't live up to the older material in my opinion. It isn't even the same band doing this album. They had a complete line-up change, and it is very obvious if you listen to the music. Underoath used to be heavy. This isn't Underoath, the band died when Dallas left the band. If you want to here some of their good material check out ""Act of Depression."" Overall it isn't a bad album, it's just not anything too special, they sound like a lot of other bands out there now."
1,Selling Out Is So Scene,"Theres really not much to say if you're a metal fan or a fan of the OLD underoath. You already know if you've heard this cd that they have totally SOLD OUT. This cd is a carbon copy of Taking Back Sunday or A Static Lullaby or any other of those screamo bands. Underoath used to be a very talented metal band but now are a mere scene band who conformed to the popular radio bands to get more money and more playing time. There is not one song on this cd i enjoyed. Underoath started moving mainstream with ""The Changing Of Times"" and has finally landed there with this piece of *%#!"
2,An Ok Album,I heard that their first cd was much better that this one. This cd was put together like every other kind of music you hear everyday. I got the cd thinking they were good but it was just plain boring.
1,Underoath ehhhhh,This CD is basically unlistenable. It's just loud with a bunch of screaming of uninteligable lyrics with nothing memorable or likable. Dont waste your money. There's better CDs out there.
5,"kent ""blah"" is an ignoramous","This schmuk thinks that slayer is a talentless band, i personally am far more into the melodic hardcore scene than any other form of hard music, but to say that kerry kings sucks as a guitarist is by far the most uninformed ignorant dumb@$$ed comment ive ever heard. What are u going to say next Zakk Wylde is the worst guitarist in metal. But as for the album i think it is the best hardcore album of 2004."
1,This is NOT Underoath!!!,I'm sorry but this is NOT Underoath. This is EMO not METAL! The cd is not Underoath. They might as well change their name to EMOoath. This cd sucks!
2,will be their one hit wonder,"I love Underoath, with the exception of this record. it was a little too mainstrem for me. Lost In The Sound, the newest album, is Underoath doing what they do best.This album reflects exactly where the band was at the time, without a lead vocalist and without direction caused by rushing to the studio and throwing 9 songs together. Aaron, the drummer, sang on most of this and new vocalist Spencer threw in screams afterwards.this would have been good as Aaron's solo album, but not as Underoath."
4,pretty good,"I like this CD by Underoath a whole lot better than The Changing of the Times. Although, I must say that I do not like the direction that they are heading in. Cries of the Past IS the best hardcore album ever and when changing came out it was COMPLETELY different. It was Screamo?! The good thing about They're Only Chasing Safety is that it sounds a little like old Underoath and mixes it with polished guitars and singing in harmony. I am pleased with this album and while yes I don't like the new singer this is an improvement over their last attempt."
4,good shit,"this cd is really good, i mean i wouldve liked more double bass, but damn this cd is very innovative. great vocals, love the message somethin positive for once u know, drumming also is simple but innovative, good stuff, i recommend giving it a listen"
5,Don't Be Swayed By Anti-Emo Sentiment,"I can tell that this whole recent wave of emo/screamo/pop punk/indie/anything that never used to appear on TRL reached its peak of popularity because good, quality cd's are now being bashed for being emo or any other said genre above. This cd being among them. If you're reading this because you have seriously considered purchasing something from Underoath, but have not heard anything from this album, don't be swayed by the sudden surge in poor reviews for this album. I've got a 10 dollar bill saying these poor reviews are for the new wave of anti-emo sentiment rather than for this album. On the otherhand, if you're not an audience for screaming and heavy riffs, perhaps this isn't for you, but don't let this new ""be cool-hate emo!"" concept sway your opinion or your desire to purchase this album. I rate this album 5 stars, not because I like emo/screamo but because I feel this album earns its 5 stars."
3,"Good, but not my favorite.","First off, I'm not that big a fan of screamo bands, but this one hit a ""sensitive"" note with me I guess you can say. I heard ""Reinventing Your Exit"" on Fuse for the first time, and I decided to check them out at the Warped Tour. They're performance blew away just about every other band there, so I decided to buy their album. A few songs stick out for me, but this isn't one of those albums with which you fall in love with every song. ""A Boy Blushed Red"" is another good tune. The screaming is melodic, heart-felt, and it doesn't seem to set itself apart from the music in any odd ways like with so many other similar bands. The lyrics are well written as is usual with most of these bands, and like most screamo bands, the lyrics are very ""teen angst"" or rather ""emo"" oriented. Which isn't a bad thing, just not everyone's cup of tea."
4,Excellent Album,"This us Underoath's 2nd album, and an excellent one at that. The only brand new song is Ten Friends and a Crowbar, and the other songs 3 are demos of other songs on the cd. The album art is a lot cooler than the original version, and there is a dvd with bonus stuff (I haven't watched the dvd yet, too busy listening to the cd haha). Definately worth your money!"
3,What Happened??,"Don't get me wrong this is a pretty damn good album, it's a rarity when the screamo/emo whatever genre is done well. Because this album is deffinetly worth a listen. It's catchy, well produced, and the clean but it's deffinetly lacking..severly. And I miss old Underoath! No more amazing guitar, bellowing growls, piercing shrieks, and blistering drums we all love from Cries of the Past. Spencer doesn't even hold a candle to Dallas.It's funny i noticed the band got softer and more radio friendly with every release. If (like most people) this is you first introduction to Underoath do yourself a favor and check out Cries of the Past and even The Changing of Times they leave TOCS in the dust."
5,Underoath,"First off I must say that people have to stop comparing this cd to Cries of the Past, Act of Depression or even The Changing of Times, UnderOath is completely different band now. Personally I think that this is the best mix of Screaming and Singing I have heard. Aaron Gillespies melodies are captivating and smooth and Spencer Chamberlains screaming is perfectly timed, intense and all around one of the best screaming voices I know. Well, im not one to discover hidden messages, but the only song here that I can decipher a direct, emphasized christian message, is obviously (to anyone whos heard it) Some Will Seek Foregiveness, Others Will Forget, I might be wrong about that though. Basically, everything else aside, I think this CD is amazing and I love the music that Underoath is producing. My favorites on the CD are ReInventing Your Exit, A Boy Brushed Red....Living In Black and White and It's A Dangerous Buisness, Walking Out Your Front Door."
3,Not bad but could have done better,An o.k. collection but don't buy it unless you are seriously collecting R & B music. You would be better off buying Blue Yule. Or even better Blues Blues Christmas 1.
1,missing charger,"I orderded this because i need the charger, there is clearly a charger included in the picture but no charger with the item I am very dissatisfied with this product"
1,No power supply,"Would have loved to actually used this product; but, it does not come with the power supply as shown in the picture. All you get is the charging tray. Bad deal."
3,Expensive for what it is,"Edited 10/30/12: The original (wrong) photo is back showing the tray *and* charger!Edited 8/29/08: Amazon have updated the photo to show only the tray - which is correct.Original review: Contrary to the picture - this item is *only* the drop in charger tray - not the tray *and* the charger. If you are adding recharge capability to your (originally) alkaline only radio then, at a minimum, you will need the rechargeable battery plus the charger. This tray simply adds the convenience of ""dropping-in"" the radio rather than plugging the charger into the radio directly."
2,Perry Mason,"My mother used to read Erle Stanley Gardner like there was no tomorrow. But the fact is he's not very good. It's assembly line Dashell Hammet, not very well written. Dull, in fact. Save your pennies for something better."
4,A great book; if only it had footnotes and some speculation,"I ran into this book entirely by chance in the musty stacks of used bookstore and naturally became very excited, as my website, a missing persons database, is named after Charley Ross. Excepting Christian Ross's memoir, this is one of only two book-length studies of the kidnapping. The other isWe Is Got Him: The Kidnapping that Changed America; I haven't read that yet. Charley's story is his father Christian's story, a heartbreaking moral dilemma that will touch people now just as much as it did in 1874.While the historian in me would have liked Zierold to footnote his sources, Little Charley Ross seems to be an accurate and unbiased book, with many details I had not previously known and a centerfold of pictures. My only wish is that Zierold could have included his own theory as to Charley's fate in the afterword. However, this is a minor quibble and the book is well worth reading without it."
5,Hollywood royalty,"Bogie and Hepburn, what, you need more? Another example of a lost Hollywood art, just good writing and fine acting. Most of the movie is just two characters talking to each other. No nudity, vulgarity or CGI baloney. Yet, you are pulled into the story. Imagine that!"
5,The African Queen,A great Bogart-Hepburn movie to add to any collection. The quality of the video is very good. Hightly recommended to everyone.
3,What?? No English sub-titles?,"I loved this film when it first came out, and would very much like to have it now on DVD, but will not. It has no English sub-titles! (I don't read Chinese.) Maybe someone else will put it on DVD with subtitles. I'l wait til then.Susan"
4,An unforgettable journey,"I loved the book, and I loved the movie. Bogie is perfect as the captain of the Queen. A friend believes Hepburn was miscast because she wasn't beautiful enough, but she's a spinster who followed her missionary brother to the deepest Africa, so you can't expect Elle McPherson, can you? The cast play their parts well and, apart from the wooden Germans at the end, the whole movie is a joy to watch."
3,A bit disapointed,The video is spectacular but the sound does not seem to sync real well with the video.
4,African Queen,"DVD was good til the last 5 minutes or so, then it started to skip. I reversed for a few minutes and restarted and this time it went all the way to the end without a problem. I will watch it again and if the problem occurs again, I will send it back for a replacement or refund."
5,DYNAMIC DUO!,"WHEN VHS MOVIES WERE FIRST AVAILABLE FOR SALE,THIS MOVIE WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE!IT STILL REMAINS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE.THE COMBINATION OF BOGIE,THE HARD BITTEN DRUNK,WHOSE HAS A MIND OF HIS OWN,AND HEBURN, THE MISSIONARY BIBLE THUMPING WOMEN WITH A MIND OF HER OWN,IS APERSONALITY CONFLICT TO THE MAX!THE OBSTICLES ARE NOT ONLY THE RIVER THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE DOWN, BUT ALSO THE GERMANS IN WW1,AND MOST OF ALL THEY MUST OVERCOME EACH OTHER! THE STORY BUILDS TO A PLEASANT SURPRISE ENDING.THIS MOVIE,TO ME,BELONGS IN EVERYONES VIDEO LIBRARY!"
5,The African Queen,"This commemorative edition is wonderful. The restoration is terrific! I loved this movie when the only way you could watch it was to go to the movie theatre. I am glad I have it now on DVD. And I must add that the commemorative edition is worth the extra money. This is a clean family worthy film. However, it might be too boring for today's kids since they are usually desirous of extremely fast moving and violent movies."
5,TheAfrican Queen,"""The African Queen"" did not need digitizing to appreciate the performances of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. However, the entire story is better understood with beautiful color and the ability to understand what each of them is saying very clearly. I loved it and would buy it for friends."
2,Import Version,"* Picture is 4:3. Quality is ok. Sound is ok.* Cannot turn off subtitle - can only choose between 3 options: English, Chinese, or Simplified Chinese. This is very annoying."
5,African Queen,"I owned this on DVD and always considered it one of the ""greats"" and among Bogarts finest. He and Katharine Hepburn interact beautifully, perhaps even better than Bogie and Bacall. It's a must-see/must-own for all that love the classical era.The Blu ray transfer is why Im writing the review, however. It's simply stunning. The sharpness, contrast, and color saturation are amazing. The transfer quality rivals that of the first four James Bond movies (Dr No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and Thunderball). It's VERY nice to see such high quality transfers on these timeless classics!"
5,Great Blu Ray,"This is a classic. The Blu Ray transfer is top notch. This will be the best you have ever seen the African Queen bar none. Now for those who only like the widescreen Blu Rays,The movie was ORIGINALLY FILMED IN 4:3 RATIO. (""Wide screen"" ratios did not exist until a few years after this movie was made, or were too costly at the time.) I was a little surprised when I first saw this as many movies of this grand scale are of the wide screen variety, but that was just the technology of the time. This detracts nothing from this great production. The sound is also vastly better than the dvd. Very happy with this version and you will be too. This is a must own!!"
5,Classic Hepburn and Bogart,"Brilliant acting, directing, and story . . . when there wasn't any need for special effects, sex, or violence to draw crowds into a theater. A time, when the art of movie making still existed, but has sadly disappeared."
5,Excellent BD Release,"I will echo the opinions of others who love this BD reissue. The picture is clean and deep, and the sound is good as well.I haven't watched any of the extras included on the blu ray, so I can't comment on them.I can now retire my Laserdisc version of this classic film, and not a moment too soon. That LD was a pretty lousy transfer all around."
3,"African Queen [Import], no off subtitles are bad","This review only refers to the Import version of this movie. Although I was happy to get a copy on DVD since I love this movie, I was not impressed with this version on a couple counts. The picture quality and sound are great but you are forced to watch the subtitles since there is no off feature in the setup. This might not be so bad except there are several mistakes in them, the worst of all is when Bogart, according to the subtitle curses, but certainly not what you hear him say. What he calls Hepburn in the subtitle is something that never would have been used back when this movie was made, but it is a common curse word now. So if you are desperate for a copy on DVD this will suffice, but I am hoping we see a British or American release of this on DVD soon. Turner Network why haven't you got this out yet? Good picture and sound DVD, bad subtitles, and good replayability. - C. Luster"
5,Very Pleasing,"The service received from this business was wonderful. This movie reconnects us to the past, when life was not so busy."
4,one of bogey's best,good story line ( I love all of C.S. Foresters stories). the dvd transfer is well done considering this predates cinemascope. very satisfied
3,Movie isn't the full version,"""The African Queen"" is such a great film, but the dvd release of this classic film doesn't include the full movie. There's a major scene from the movie that is nowhere to be found on the dvd version. The scene when they break out of the reeds and on to the lake and see the Louisa for the first time was deleted from the dvd version and I have no idea why. The deletion of that scene is why I'm only giving this dvd release three stars instead of five."
2,More than I wanted,"I have been a fan of African Queen for years and have waited and waited for it DVD release. I don't care that it's an import but I was not aware that there is no way to stop any type of subtitles from showing. There are three choices: Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English. It's spoken in English. I can watch it with subtitles but would prefer not to but there is no option to NOT have subtitles."
3,Shows its age,"It was great movie in its time, but it's really showing its age now. I bought the movie as a family treat for my grandchildren, but it was a disappointment."
1,WAIT!,"According to the Internet Movie Database, Paramount Home Video is slated torelease ""The African Queen"" in 2008.Might as well wait for the real deal."
3,disappointing,I like Bogart and I like Hepburn but I couldn't get into this movie. It just wasn't interesting in any way. I really wish I could rate this higher but it was a major disappointment to me when I saw it on the movie channel yesterday.
3,African Queen,"We really wanted a copy of African Queen and couldn't find one. This copy is colorized which I think reduces the originality of the film. However, if the choice is this or nothing, this works fine. There are no special features or interviews, just the film."
3,WHAT! Another Import?,"I have been waiting for an American release of this movie since I purchased a DVD player. Was I excited when I first spotted this DVD for pre-order. Then I read that it is another ""IMPORT""! When is the American studio going to release this great movie in a ""re-mastered"", ""Special Edition"" DVD that it deserves??? Disappointed Again! Since I have not watched this exact release, I will give it a 3 Star rating, just to be fair. I have another ""Import"" version from Korea that I would give a 3 rating to in my collection."
1,African Queen dvd,Did not play in DVD player and needs to be returned . I t was a gift with several other DVD's that worked great. Very disappointed.
5,One of the Greatest Classics,Just can't say enough about this movie. Just one of the greatest classic's of all time. The history how they made this movie is what Iwould read first and then watch the movie.
5,Good price and great condition,"I've loved African Queen since I first saw it in a theater - Bogart and Hepburn were brilliant. I ordered a copy on blu-ray and when it arrived, I was surprised because the price had actually gone down! Great film and great job of transfer! The stars would be pleased."
2,Big Disappointment,Poor quality control.The dvd skipped and stopped in several places. Customer service instructed me to wash it twicewhich I did. Played it again to make sure it was ok. Still had part of the ending missing. Washed it again. Seemed to be viewable in its entirety but still not 100% certain.What a waste of time having to wash it several times and then forced to watch it again and again to determine if it was ok before the return time expires.
5,Great Movie!,"Except for the unrealistically civil way Mr. Allnut responded to his gin being poured into the river, and then his wonderful behavior without the gin, it was an amazing journey. Of course, if his behavior had actually been realistic for an alcoholic, it wouldn't have been as much fun too watch. The development of the relationship between such different people was a joy to see."
1,"Love the movie, hate the print","I've enjoyed this film for years, and was delighted when I found it was finally available on DVD.Unfortunately, when I got the Asian print ( a fact which my supplier did not mention), I found that its quality resembles a cell-phone camera pirate print.My advise to y'all is to wait for a better version. When a good one comes out, I'll be throwing the one I bought away."
2,What does Amazon mean that the movie is dubbed?,"So is this the actual release I have been reading about or some foreign knock off?Did Amazon just cut and past some other item description?So they say the format is ""dubbed"" What ????????????"
1,no show,When I purchased this dvd I had no idea what region 2 was so therefore I cannot play the dvd. It wasn't explained very good at all Now I'm stuck with it I blame myself half and the seller half NEVER heard of region 2
2,Movie not complete,"I am quite disappointed, This is my wife's favorite movie so we were very happy to get it. But we were very disappointed to find it was missing a major scene that is in the movie. Does anyone one know why the scene when they break out of the reeds and on to the lake and see the Louisa for the first time was left off the DVD?"
4,Rolling adventure with social commentary,"I love this film. The characters are engaging and the action suspense is continuous.One thing after another shows the human drive to survive and succeed. The juxtaposition of western religion and raw African nature and nativesis rich beyond words. Thanks Charlie, thanks Rosie."
1,Old Movie,"Made a mistake and chose a CODE TWO movie which cannot be played on our DVD players but is meant for Europe. As it was intended as a gift, I asked about returning it but within 24 hours I was told the window to return had closed. So, it was just a waste of money for me.I highly recommend everyone check closely and read everything to be sure that when you purchase a movie it is CODE ONE which is for the USA. The word Universal for this product also doesn't apply."
4,african quen blu ray,"This film is classic without even discussing WAS remastered? The quality of the remaster compared to MANY films transferred to blu is AWFULIt appears they just did a transfer to blu ray like Robocop; St Elmo's Fire and so many others just to make a buck.I have seen enough 1080 transfers to know what I am talking aboutThey should be SHOT! The resolution, as an example...the lines in Bogey's or Lauren's face; non existentThere is CRAP out there transferred to blu that looks 'higher def'; this film deserves better!!!A MUST HAVE but could have been done better. CRIPES! They are **redoing** GLADIATOR on blu!!!"
1,The African Queen,Received the wrong CD Rom/DVD. Was sent The Jacksons instead of what I ordered....The African Queen.Have not heard back from the merchant and it has been 3 weeks. Very disappointed. Will not purchase any other DVD's.Judi Feldman
1,African Queen,I've seen the movie before and it is great. I haven't seen it lately because I still haven't received it from my order a month ago.
4,African Queen,Have always like Bogart and Hepburn they always seem to be great to bring out the story line. Highly recommend this movie. Blu-Ray makes it a have to have.We ordered from Amazon.com you can't ask for any better pricing on GOOD Blu-Ray movies
1,BOOTLEG! UnCertified/UnAuthorized for Resale in the US.,"Hard to believe Amazon allows the sale of Asian import releases on their site. If you go over to the Internet Movie Data Base, you will see that this title is NOT certified to be sold in the USA.Note: I'm rating the release and the fact that it's a BOOTLEG, not the movie, itself. The film is fantastic.Illusion"
2,NOT EXCITING.,"HUMPHEY BOGART IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS AND HIS ACTING IN THIS MOVIE IS SUPERB AS USUAL. THE MOVIE AS A WHOLE IS CORNY AND UNREALISTIC. NO DOUBT, IT WILL APPEAL TO SOME PEOPLE. A 12 OLD CHILD, A PERSON WHO DOES NOT WANT TO GET SCARED, A PERSON THAT WANTS TO LAUGH."
4,Things to do with my kid.....,"This book is pretty helpful for those weekend 'what do you feel like doing' moments. I have lived in NY my whole life, (30 years) and had never been to the (mini) zoo in Queens. It lists some pretty cool places to go and see, with accurate and updated descriptions. If you have kids, and live in NY, you need this book."
5,Dose this work for Motorola Talkabout series of radios?,Dose this charger work with the Motorola Talk about series? Or dose it not work looking to get it because I always forget get to leave my radio and I take it home and the next day the battery is gone so just looking.
1,Not what it claimed to be,"Under the Technical Details, it clearly states:* Push-to-talk microphone button located on sideHaving received it, I can clearly state that is not the case."
4,bigger than expected.,"I'm used to ty beanie babies, so expected this to be a perfect stocking stuffer. It's too big for that.Still, i'm not disapointed because its perfect size for my 3 year old to play with. i just have to wrap it up instead of put it in the stocking.the reason i give it 3 stars for durablity, is because it is big enough to be played with, but not sure how long it will last being thrown around. It's standard beanie baby workmanship, but those arent meant to be thrown around."
2,Not a book for the dinofans,"If you were thinking about buying this book for your kids or a dinofan friend, a word of advise: it mightbe a bit over their heads. This book is basically an amalgamate of scientific papers without any editorial instrusion; they are true scientific papers for scientists in the style of scientific journals. Though profusely illustrated, it is not a field guide with lots of recreations and dioramas which might be what most kids and dinofans would want. Most of the illustrations are maps of the areas where a sample fossil was found or drawings and pictures of actual fossil bone at the site where found. Only the turtles and crocodiles sections of the book have some recreations of the creatures; but you will not find a single recreation drawing of an ichthyosaur. For the scientific reader this is a definite 5 star, for most everyone it might be only 2 or 3 star."
2,Technical and Dry,"Unless your a paleontologist yourself, this book will probably be too technical to read and too dry to enjoy. Specialists familiar with serious scientific jargon may delight in Ancient Marine Reptiles. Otherwise, you're bound to get a headache trying to understand what's going on."
4,She is simply the Best!,"As a swede and more or less grown up with Zarah Leander, when parents always saying "" children be quit Zarah sings on the radio"" This CD are very good. I love the recording from 1950 of the song ""Irgendwo,Irgendwan fängt keine Mädschen an"" from the movie Gabriela, you also have the beautiful song sanged so divine by Die Leander "" Ich will nicht vergessen"" its the same with ""Du bist genau mit die anderen"". Just a curiosity the last track a potp called ""Die Lustige Witwe"" Mrs Leander are singing duett with sven Olof Sandberg the most famous popular singer in Sweden between 1930-1950. I guess Zarah Leander was even bigger and more popular then Greta Garbo in Sweden and in german speaking countries 1930-1950. This Christmasday the Swedish Television (SVT) showed a 1,5 /h very interesting documentary of Zarah`s life from the begining to the end and she herself was the speaker, based on her own storries broadcasted in on the radio 1972?."
1,Like a bite from a dog with no teeth,"You know you're supposed to feel something at some point but nothing really breaks the skin. The charecters are soulless and pretty boring even when compared solely to the other books in the series. The plot is by the numbers and predictable at every turn.When one reads a mystery novel you want to have to pay attention for every clue, every charecter shading, and yet hope to be surprised at the end despite your efforts. No such energy need be expended with this novel. You'd have to be reading the book in a different language to be surprised by anything that happens here. The set-ups are childish and can be seen a mile away.If you have to buy this to complete your set of Hard Case Crime, be my guest. I did. Everyone else, take a few steps back and try ""Fade to Blonde"" or ""Marked Woman""."
5,Please come back,"This is by far the best flavor of Andy Capp fries. Why oh why must they be sold out everywhere, and for the last year. If this flavor is forever discontinued I may never recover."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!!!,"Do not, I REPEAT, Do NOT waste your time or MONEY on this so-called book.This man knows nothing about Bob, Rasta, OR BLACK CULTURE. It's an insultto us who are Rasta, Jamaican and fed up with Americans USING Bob for their gain. This is why true Rasta, only reason and Follow Jah. We noton their path to glory fame money.One day a voice will emerge chosen by Bob himself to speak the REAL TRUTH,and that will become the true story.Too much SAID, not enough WISDOM Foolish man, soon find hiself wit otherfools. Now, I waste my time no more.Bob trust nobody: we tired of this. Jah bring Truth."
4,The Cutting Edge - Chasing the Dream,"I did enjoy this movie but not as much as the first movie ""The Cutting Edge"". It was a good movie because I do enjoy figure skating very much, however, could not give it 5 stars,"
2,Pleasant,"This show was okay, entertaining but predictable. I find that it is extremely hard to produce a sequel, let alone sequels,#3. I enjoyed the movie, however; I knew everything that was going to happen."
2,Same as first one,"Caution: spoilersI loved the first movie but I think they went to the well one too many times. While the actors are engaging, this is a repeat of the first movie; they even do the same Pamchenko move at the end. The only difference this time? Instead of the male being a poor, hockey player and the female being rich, the female is a poor, hockey player and the male is rich. The pair even sneaks into the big contest by placing one out of the money and then an incident happens that lets them squeak in. If you saw the first one, you've seen this one (except the first one was better)."
2,Doable,"There were some decent skating scenes, but overall, not a terribly interesting movie. The main male skater was decent, but the 2 female leads were like teeny boppers. The whole theme seemed like a soap opera. Sad, but the first Cutting Edge can never really be improved upon."
3,This dictionary is not on par with other Oxford language dictionaries,"Being an American, I found it difficult to understand the British English translations. I was also disappointed that there aren't as many entries under the main word like there are in the Oxford French and German dictionary, but the Oxford Italian dictionary from Amazon is much more expensive ($43.55) than the others. Even though it costs more, it is much smaller than Oxford's French and German dictionary, the pages are very thin, and the binding is bad. I had to have the dictionary replaced twice, because the binding separated from the backing. The third time I sent it back, Amazon's customer service emailed me that this was a persistent problem with this dictionary and that the company was not going to send a replacement. Meanwhile, I'm using Webster's New World Italian dictionary which is excellent for a paperback."
5,Dictionary for Bureaucrats--but for others too,"One might sometimes think that this dictionary is meant for government clerks talking about the EU--there are many entries that seem to me more descriptions of bureaucratic functions than lexicography. But this is a cavil--those things are there if you want them. It's fine for Dante's Italian too. It is a very good, thorough dictionary for anyone with serious needs in the language. Its grammatical articles (a pure extra, after all, in a dictionary) are plentiful and crystal clear. Its tables of verbs, clothing sizes, conversions, you-name-it, are likewise. It's a bit big to carry around, of course."
4,Life true to form,"The book Daughter of the Sun by Carmen Sol Feliciano is something that I am proud to add to my collection of great works of art. The poems speak to you loud and clear and paint vivid pictures for your imagination. The work takes you from happiness to sadness and back again, all the time staying true to itself, REAL. I would reccomend this to any one. It has peace, tranquility, serenity, beauty and life."
5,Perfect Fit,"tried other shades but they didnt fit, this one fits perfect and rolls up for storageIf you have a smaller windshield, try this company!"
5,His voice is like honey for the heart.,"Julio is able to bring so much love and passion to any song that he sings. In crazy he is remaking an already famous song and many will be surprised, they may find that Julio is able to present a beautiful love song that will melt every heart. Put this album on when you are with the one you love and let your spirit soar with the music."
1,ignorance is inexcusable,"I thought about reading this one until I caught part of an interview with the author. He was talking about the origins of agriculture in the middle east and his complete ignorance of the subject was painfully obvious to anyone who has even dipped into the topic. Ignorance did not stop him from spewing misinformation with confidence and fluency. I'd be surprised to learn that he knew any more about the other toopics in this book than he does about how farming began, and I certainly don't have the time to waste finding out."
5,walking the bible,This book is very interesting. Not only because of the oportunity to hear about the land he is travelling Bruce Fieler writes in such a way that you feel as though you are right there with him. He does not write as though he is the teacher so we should just sit down and read. This is a very friendly Very informative book.
3,"An honest, poetic journey","This book was great for someone like me whose faith is rooted in the Bible, love history and will likely never get the chance to personally visit any of the places mentioned on this journey from Noah to Moses - Turkey to Egypt and in-between. The author is adventuresome, excellent in descriptions - sights, sounds and smells and adds a broad knowledge and excellent resource of guides along the way. Its really an awesome modern summary tour of ancient biblical areas. I have not seen the video yet but plan to.In terms of unavoidable questions of faith that overlap with Christianity, Judaism and Islam, the author seems inquisitive, honest and respectful, yet ultimately firm in apparent agnosticism. I guess I was just personally hoping he would . . . after all that journeying and questioning . . . say a prayer."
3,an interesting journey,"this is a book about faith rather than fact.yet it is very informative about the geography of the old middle east and sheds a little light on the conflict today.the author seem more interested in his own interpretation than the people he interviews.i happened to read ""the bible unearthed"" right afterwards,and it dampened my enthousiasm for the book"
5,"Tuna, anyone?","If I were a child, I'd read it under the covers with my sturdy Mideast hat and sunglasses. Instead, I just didn't put it down from Ararat to Nebo. It bridges the gap from the Bible to today, beautifully. I'm familiar with both."
3,Walking the Bible,"Bruce Feiler, a nominal Jew, describes his journey to the Holy Land... His stories are fascinating as he and his guide retrace their steps while they explore the world of Old Testament characters and Biblical stories. It tells of Bruce's personal pilgrimage and spiritual awakening."
2,Error by ommission,"Feilor writes a readable travelogue but manages to travel through the middle east drawing historical conclusions but (conveniently?) ignores most of the Arab cultural contributions made in a packed couple of millenia. Most of the Arabs who appear in the book are ""extras"", typically presented as ignorant laborers, or obnoxious children. In the light of the Israelis' aggressive and violent encroachments onto Palestinian territories on the West Bank, this viewpoint serves only to foster the myth that the current and recent historical occupants of this area are ""non-people"". Feilor, however, does not come across as mean-spirited: only callow. Don't read this book for insights into Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, or Egypt: go ahead if you want to better understand Israel's perceptual difficulties."
3,Walking the Bible - Lite,"I started the book with enthusiasm and debated whether I'd give it four or five stars. Finishing the last page, the question was whether to give it three or four. Now that I've had a couple of weeks' for digestion, it's with generousity I give it three. The book should be titled Walking the Bible - Lite. Feiler says he read a room of books in preparation for his trek. Maybe so, but what he passes along is superficial. The book has a great premise. Many of the people he meets along the way and their cultures are fascinating. But, he never gets below the surface. Feiler's breezy writing style is easy to read, but sometimes less is more. Not everything needs a simile. Comparing a jagged mountain range to the edge of his just opened tuna can? Yikes! Much of the book deals with Feiler's gee whiz moments of spiritual awakening, connecting to his roots. I'm sure for him the experiences were profound. For me they're neither profound nor interesting."
3,Walking,Begins very well. When reading a book of this nature I like to have a maps. It became a little difficult for me to keep up with just where he was heading. For me it wasn't quite what I expected. But that's my fault.
3,This Book is a Keeper,"This is an ingenius idea for a book and will have a long shelf life; the topic after all is a perennial. There is only one problem which is that the book walks through so much terrain, literal and biblical, that it gets tiring. Perhaps the author should have made this a two-volume collection because then he could have condensed it, made it more punchy, less tiresome. But, he's a good writer and it's worth owning. I recommend reading it slowly, as one would read the Bible, in fact."
5,Walking the Bible,This is an incredible companion to the book everyone should have both. They give you a new and wonderful prospective of the Bible and Gods Holy word. It truly brings it all alive. Once you see the places you have a new way of looking at what you read in the Bible you see the places and they become alive and more real that you ever thought they could be.
4,Great book if you have traveled to the Middle East,"I started reading this book last fall, before traveling to Egypt & Israel. I borrowed a copy from the local library, but didn't finish it so, bought it on kindle to take with me. I read all the parts about Egypt before we got to Egypt, but couldn't finish it in time for Israel a few days later.Anyway, I finished it now ( a few months later) and I thought it was a great addition to my travels.Bruce really conveys what it means to travel in these countries spiritually. I highly recommend this book to anyone of any religion that has or dreams of these travels. Issues being what they are nowadays, I'm thankful I had the experience over there. It's a lengthy read but well worth it! Will plan on reading more of Bruce's books in the near future."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"I just finished reading this book. INCREDIBLE! The author takes two years to walk through the Pentateuch (literally), meets all kind of people in the Middle East, does tremendous research into everything from geography to Bible history to Middle Eastern hospitality traditions, and serves the whole thing up as a delightful story and journey. His guide is a man named Avner who seems to know everyone who has any passion or interest in the Middle East. As he encounters God in the desert you encounter God with him.This was an intellectual and a faith building feast. I can't express how thankful I am for this book."
1,Stiga Table Tennis Cover,"This product is so inferior it should not be on the market. I have an outdoor table tennis table, and I covered my table for protection with this product. When I removed the cover, the table top had been ruined with a marbleized, oily-appearing pattern over the entire table. It does not wash off with detergent and water or with ammonia and water. This product has ruined the appearance of my table. It is very distracting for good ping pong playing. My other complaint about the product is that there is no protection for the corners. The material rips with the first use. I suspected this from reading other reviews, and I protected all corners with a pad to avoid this. But the oil-like marbleization is cause to go back to the drawing board with this product."
1,Cheap Vinyl,"Made in China. It lasted for exactly 2 days. Some gusty wind, just a tad stronger than the 'gentle brezze' level, easily shredded it and blew it away one night. My wife found its remains 300 yards away, in the woods. Buy this and you WILL be sorry."
1,Pass on this,Cheaply made. Tears easily. Invest in something stronger. Ours ripped the third night we put it on.
1,Table Tennis Cover Has Poor Fit and Durability,"The table tennis cover was advertised for our model of table. It did not fitwell and started to tear in the corners. Because of the tear we kept it, butwe are not pleased with the fit or the durability of the plastic."
2,Not a durable product,This quickly developed small rips and tears in it when we took it on and off. The only thing going for it is it can cover both a folded table and a table that is open.
1,Terrible,"I bought this product hopeing that it would help to protect the table which I bought. It did nothing to help. After the first rain, when i removed it, the rain had soaked right through the cover and ruined the table. We had to return the table and have it replaced. Do not buy this product.-Zack"
3,Cover for Tennis table,I expected the material to be thicker than it is and of better quality. This cover does not protect adequately the table especially when it rains.
2,Not a tough material,"While the cover fits the table in the upright position, the corner ripped against the edge of the table the first time I put it on. It also doesn't protect the bottom side of the table in this position."
4,durable,"I don't know what to say about a product like this. It works, the price was great and it is durable. Perfect for what I had a need for. Did not want to spend too much money but still wanted a decent quailty product."
5,Great little speakers,I bought these for my portable dvd player and I'm really pleased with them. The sound quality is excellent for such a small speaker. I doubt you can do much better for the price either.
3,I feel suckered.,"The score is excellent, if fact, it's very original and interesting to listen to.... but I didn't get all the music that was in the movie. The ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" track isn't there. As they say in Germany... ""I bought a cat in a sack"". Should have inspected the product before buying the CD.Marketing people need to learn that they will actually make more money if they actually give what they label says. As a result of the intentional misleading, people are going to become suspicious and will be forced to look at every track before buying a CD. If a specific track isn't there, they won't buy it. If ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" had been there, they would have sold more of this album.... because I'm sure people are becoming ""leary""."
1,Were are the real songs,This CD doenst have any of the actual songs from the movie...I was hoping for the rock songs not the musical score...the Ghost Riders song is done by spiderbait but its not available anywere
1,"Like Everyone else, not what I am looking for.",I thankfully read the reviews first. I was really looking for the instrumental version of Ghost Rider in the Sky in the movie. I am really disappointed that it was not on the soundtrack.
1,Ghost Rider Flop,"I was very upset after listening to the whole cd and wondering where the song, ghost riders in the sky, was at. That is the main reason that I bought the cd and all I got was all music, no singing."
3,"HINT - When you see ""music composed by.....""","This isn't a hard concept. When a soundtrack says ""music composed by..."" it is a film score. When a soundtrack says ""music from the movie or by multiple artists"" it is the actual songs from the movie."
3,Whos sings that song?,"The movie was great....but those anybody know, the song that is played when they go the the ghost riders house the first time. He turns on the lights.. and his firned it telling him how he needs to get a lock for the door... and that song in the back round?..........when he just want to relax ?"
2,??? Soundtrack???,"Although I was entertained by the movie, I certainly did not enjoy this soundtrack....Where are ALL the great songs played for the movie????"
1,why this sucks,"this soundtrack is an absolute waste of money. the problem being that the only good song on the entire movie is not included, which of course is ghost riders in the sky by spiderbait. yes it was done performed by spiderbait and not released on any albums."
2,Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed to get this cd and find that it only has the background music on it and not all the songs that was in the movie. The music is good and I enjoy listening to it, but it is not what I bought the cd for. I actually looked to make sure that I had gotten the right cd as it was not what I expected at all."
4,"Great music but no ""Riders in the Sky""","I highly enjoyed the Ghost Rider Movie and thought the music was incredible. I hit the internet hard to find the soundtrack as soon as I got home from the theater.When I got the cd, I was disapointed to find that it was the background music. Then I listeded. It is excelent. My only true gripe is that it does not have the song ""Riders in the sky."""
2,Misleading...,"even though I enjoy the scores in this movie, thus making the cd not a compleat waste of time I am severly dissapointed in them for putting out such a misleading item.To all you who made this, if it says SOUNDTRACT most of us consumers want ALL the music played in the movie!I also was looking for the title song ""Ghost Riders"" and got just a bit peeved when it wasnt there."
3,Ghost rider CD,"mostly just the score of the movie, songs are slow. I wish they added the last one and some some with vocals."
1,the sound of wasted money,"This CD while full of nice music, is to me rather pointless.It's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals.Does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie?Aside from Crazy train?"
3,Disclaimer raises questions,This accounting of the events portrayed seems contrived and fictional simply because the author lacked the courage (or knowledge) for explaining the characters and events factually. I would have rated it higher if not for Kellys's insistance on claiming this story was true.
3,Another County heard from,"I have long been interested in this particular chapter of NYPD history. Robert Daley helped lay out Robert Leucci's side with Prince of the City and Sonny Grosso quickly rebutted him with Point Blank. 20 years later this book tells it with a different, somewhat shocking slant. All told I favor Grosso's version on most events, but this book is still entertaining although, I probably should have waited for the paperback."
5,believe it!,"Just a phenomenal book... loaded with juicy tidbits... although, a sad commentary from back then. John Lindsay doesn't come off too good, but, as a whole the book is great. Told from a ""I was there perspective."" Good, good buy!"
1,"Yes, dull","I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote, ""in a word- dull"". I really enjoyed the previous book in the series, Firestar, but this one drags on waaaay too long (which is strange, because it's shorter than Firestar, but seems much longer), and too litle or no end. A big disapointment."
1,"Always seems like it's about to get good, but never does","One word: dull. As I read, it always seemed like something was about to happen, but nothing ever did. The Flaco character was the only good thing in this book, and his sections are the only ones I enjoyed. Everything else was too long, drawn out, and there were too many characters, many of which had very little to say. Save yourself some time and skip this one."
1,Where's the 'Sci' part of the SciFi.,Boring. Very little science in this science fiction book. The reviewers on the back cover must not have read the same version of this book that I did.
1,Too wordy and boring.,"It is difficult to believe that the author of this book also wrote In the Country of the Blind. This book meanders around for what seems like forever and never seems to be going anywhere in particular. When I find myself reading only the first sentence of each paragraph, as I often did in this book, I know the pace of the story has fallen virtually to zero. If it was cut by one-half to two-thirds in length, it might move at a better pace. It also needs to focus on some interesting problem or conflict that a reader is interested in seeing resolved. The previous volume was somewhat better, but suffered similar problems. I gave it the benefit of the doubt in hopes that the second volume would get the story on track. Unfortunately, the trend seems to be in the opposite direction. I'll definitely pass on the third volume."
4,Solid everyday possible future that brings Sci-fi home,"Good follow up to Firestar. The Sci-Fi in this book could well become reality and makes one understand the need for a different route to space other than the one we are on. Science Fiction might be the wrong moniker for this book, perhaps adventure...Can't wait for Lodestar..."
2,Michael Flynn needs to meet a black person,"Memo to Michael Flynn: When Tim Meadows would say ""Word"" in skits on Saturday Night Live, he was actually making fun of people who think that's actually part of black peoples' slang. It's not, it never has been and will not be in the year 2009.I enjoyed Firestar and thought it moved at about the right pace. I am less than halfway through this sequel and dread the thought of all the time I must put in to finish it. It is padded and dull."
2,A Long Week,"I picked up Rogue Star at the bookstore one weekend, not knowing what it entailed. Although part of a series, Flynn does well to keep new readers in the loop about what is going on. Readers who are new to the series can dive in with this book without feeling lost. Unfortunately, I found the book lacked a great deal of intensity. There are multiple character story lines, but it is a terribly long read with not much in the way of plot development along the way. Although charcters develop over the course of the book, we're still left wondering why it takes 500 pages to get to the bulk of the plot. If you're looking for an epic and enjoy a fairly ""true to life"" outer space experience, this is for you. Otherwise I recommend to steer clear!"
5,You don't have to be four.,"I have had this book since I was two. When I was small I used to sit on my dad's knee and he would read the book. Then I would open the flaps on the pages, and help dad to make the funny smell noises. Now of course I am more mature than that, and I read the book for my two year old sister. There are two people in the book, Ben and Annabelle, and there are lots of animals making smells. Some are nice smells, but the best ones are the nasty smells, pee-youuu!"
4,cute and funny,Very cute book. Every child will have fun reading this book and trying to find where that smell is coming from.
5,Very well done,It is a great picture for your dad your boyfriend or if your a guy who likes these movies
1,Your Purchase is a waste of time,"I purchase this picture frame, it came in time. When I received this poster the glass was broken and the picture was damaged. I called Adam Hersh company, three months later after calling every week I finally received a second poster in the same condition. Broken frame, glass and damaged picture AGAIN. It is a waste of time contacting this company for any refunds, or replacements. It took three months before I was able to receive another picture. Now what am I to do with a second damaged picture again.I am disgusted with the service. I have never had any issues with any purchases from Amazon. I have purchased from Amazon for almost three years. this is the first time I am disgusted with the service from Adam Hersh Company.Godfather Goodfellas Sopranos Heat Scarface Art Poster Print - 16"" X 20"""
5,More than expected advice regarding SPC!,"I have had formal graduate education in SPC from world class leaders. But this book is a must read for anyone who performs statistical analysis for quality management, especially in the health care arena. I actually covet the Hart's advice and would declare that any reader would learn much from this reading. The tidbits of knowledge will assist the quality staff in interpretation far beyond any courses that I am aware of in the U.S. This book will make you a cut above others in your field."
5,Excellent Reference!,I found this book to be exactly what I wanted--a solid reference on process control for health care. It walked me through many key issues in statistical process control and will serve as a great reference.This book is not for the advanced statistician by any means--but it is a good tool for use in health care by typical quality management staff.
5,Outstanding Western,"Ex-sheriff turned bounty hunter Henry Fonda teaches the lawman trade to rookie peace officer Anthony Perkins in an excellent, intelligent western. High marks go to both cast and direction. Fonda plays to perfection one of his trademark type of roles, the weary, reluctant hero. A fine film by any measure. Highly recommended."
3,Tin Star,"Anthony Mann's THE TIN STAR was a little disappointing. Mann was an early expert in 'psychological' westerns and I guess this one fits that category. Henry Fonda plays bounty hunter Morg Hickman, a man with a past. Hickman rides into town with a bounty trophy and, this being a fairly civilized town, is shunned by the citizens. Doesn't seem to bother him much, though. While waiting for his bounty money to come through he becomes involved with a local widder and her young `un and helps set young and clumsy sheriff Ben Owens (Anthony Perkins) on the right track.THE TIN STAR is a little light and domestic for Mann. A run-of-the-mill story with acceptable acting by all involved."
3,Running on Empty,"I got this off Netflix because I was caught up with River Phoenix and learned he'd been nominated for best supporting actor for his role here. The scene between his mother and grandfather tore me up when she offered to let her boy go to him and the reasons why. Her teary admissions, his defiance at first then when she got up to go, his own emotions coming through. I got this off amazon.com a few years ago and through the years, I have lost the interest I initially had for this movie, but it's still great - specially the scene between the mother and her own father."
5,Running On River,"Really amazing movie,i love it to death!River is amazing i'm so sad he died so young he had so much talent but you can't get mad at him like the amazon review did you just have to feel sorry 4 him.River and Martha are great together.this movie is sad but happy at the same time.It made me laugh then it made me cry.River we miss you R.I.P."
1,Great movie - terrible DVD,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I think this DVD must have been one of WB's first releases back in 1998. It desperatly needs to be updated. There are no special features whatsoever and worst of all, it's presented in FULL SCREEN only! I don't even think it was digitally remastered, as it looks no better than a VHS copy. But if you haven't seen it, or can't wait for a version more worthy of its brilliance, go ahead and pick this turkey up. You'll probably find it on the bargain shelf somewhere."
4,River Phoenix at his best,"Probably one of River Phoenix's best performances--quiet, subtle and affecting. What many writers, directors and actors unsuccessfully convey through too many words, River triumphed in with a brief look. I saw this in its original release and was moved beyond all thought. A family's undeniable devotion to one another and the painful sacrifices that each member makes in order to give the other happiness is the truest testament of what defines a family's love.Danny Pope's struggle for independence, stability, his love for music and a desire to study at Julliard. But his devotion and committment to his family is heartwrenching. Seeing Christine Lahti's character having lunch with her stoic father and begging for his forgiveness will floor you, and this his reaction when she leaves is a double whammy.A great drama that is beautifully executed."
5,"Marlon Brando, James Dean, Jack Nicholson, RIVER PHOENIX","River Phoenix was a teenager when he was acting in this film. His performance was more like Jack Nicholson in the early 70's or James Dean in the 50's. He is one of the greatest actors who ever lived. River Phoenix was such a great looking young man but he never let his looks be the star of a film. He had incredible emotional depth and a raw, personal style of acting that few actors have ever come close to. I would say his performances in ""Running On Empty"", ""Dogfight"", and ""My Own Private Idaho"" rank among the greatest in film history. If you enjoy this movie, you might also enjoy Jack Nicholson's ""Five Easy Pieces""."
3,The One And Only River Phoenix!!!!!,"Ah, River Phoenix. A great actor that rises to any story line. And, to me, that's the only way to qualify as a great actor."
2,"well-done, sympathetic account of scofflaws","This is a well-done, sympathetic account of scofflaws.The characters are likable, the story is interesting and well-done.On the other hand, this is an account of a family that is on the run from the law, and their cleverness and success in doing so should not be romanticized. I accordingly downrated it.They should turn themselves in and plead their case in court, like law-abiding citizens."
4,A good movie,"I enjoyed Running on Empty really because of River Phoenix. He is such an incredible actor and he really shows his acting skills in this movie. I also liked Martha Plimpton in this movie, she was very good."
3,Shame on Warner Home Video!,How can Warner release this great film in such a poor format? It's been poorly cropped and panned to fit a normal TV screen and released in mono sound.Shame on you Warner Home Video! When will this travesty be rectified?
3,Nice Book For Newbies,"As you can read elsewhere on this page, this book is largely geared towards those who know nothing about Google Adwords, affiliate programs or Search Engine Optimization. If this describes you, and you want to know how you can make money with the Google Adwords program, this book is a great place to start. It will walk you from start (building a website) to finish (getting paid)."
5,It Works!,"Yes. His ideas work. And he explains his ideas well, using sufficient images to get his points across. You're not going to get rich off AdSense in just 30 days, but if you implement his ideas and suggestions, you will start to make money from your website and blog without having to do much more than provide interesting content.Go out and buy this book, now!"
1,What a huge disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this one, having had it on my wish list ever since I heard about it. Well, I am sad to say that this book has very little to actually say about Adsense. It is mostly about building a web site, not about optimizing Adsense clicks or revenue. I held off on buying Joe Comm's ebook because it cost more, but it packed a ton more meat in fewer pages. Get the ebook and leave the hardcopy on the shelf."
4,"Fantastic read for some, but not me.","Overall, I was actually pretty disappointed with the book, however I still believe it to be something of a gem. While it was was as expected, I still hoped for a little more in the way of some juicy hints and tips that have resulted from personal experience and research. In its place, we have a wondefully articulated and structured dialogue that reveals the concept of AdSense and the steps required to lead upto creating pages and using advertisements.The book has little benefit for those already using AdSense, however it will be a great read for those that might dabble with making websites or want to understand the fuss of Google."
3,"Good, but if and only if..","If you're the casual internet user with very little or no experience, this book is for you. All the information is provided in a well written and easy to read way, all wrapped up in a colorful book. Most of the book deals with how to make a site, buying a domain, and finding hosting.The author himself stresses that this is a beginner's book and all the other reviews that say this book can be useful to anyone but a novice is lying. All the information in this book can be obtained by a few hours of browsing AdSense's FAQ and reading forums at sites like webmasterworld.com. Overall, valuable if you're a novice that wants to get into internet publishing monetized by Adsense but worthless for pretty much anyone else.3/5.-edwin. www.nothingexpert.com"
2,Facile and annoying,"The book is written in the format of an ongoing conversation between the author and 3 friends who want to make money and have website ideas. If you really knew absolutely nothing about the topic and were not put off by this style, you might find it worthwhile. I was really surprised at how lightweight it is, considering the price tag and the publisher, Peach Pit Press, whose books are usually the best."
4,Very good book for newbies,"This book is well written, I spected some more technical contents but is good for the common people to begin earning incomes with the Google's advertising program. It's more of the style of ""Become a Web Master in a bit of days"" than ""Become rich in two seconds"", I thing it's a recommendable reading for those that wanto to begin in the Web and have good tips for the intermediate and advanced ones."
4,Great Support!!!,"After reading the reviews, I have to agree with the majority. This is a book for those who do not have websites or the knowledge about the Internet. I have about 50, of which a couple pull about 5000 visitors a day. I was able to skip through a lot of chapters and get to the Adsense section. Using the book, I was able to increase my daily intake from about $11 to about $70.00 (that's over $2000.00 a month)and obviously paid for the book. :)The best part was that I really didn't understand a section and I e-mailed the author, Eric. HE REPLIED!! He has given a little more insight to my particular situation and it has helped. I think that there may be another book on the horizon for those of us who are ready to progress to MEMWG II. I'll buy it."
2,Strictly for newbies,"There is very little information in this book that I found helpful even if I were a beginner. Lots of common sense. I found the format annoying (""dialog-based""). My recommendation - use the web for information. I returned the book. PS: There is no ""easy"" way to make money on Adsense... it takes a lot of work."
4,The book is great for beginners who wants to learn about AdSense,The book was very helpful to me. It is true that I could have found the same information online but not with the same explanations and presentation. The book is not written for technical people and the author makes it clear. Rather the book is written for an average person who is interested in creating a website and using the website to advertise ads from Google.

2,Lacking in many areas!,"I purchased this book on Gandhi as an intro to his life and works. I did not realize that it was written over 50 years ago though, and it shows. What I mean is- if you are looking for a very human portrait of the man, look elsewhere. I just couldn't get through this. The first 20 pages alone skip around so much and leave out years of his life- it leaves the reader feeling lost. There is no explanation as to what he thought, felt, etc. It's mainly cold hard facts about his life, and the history of the time. Not a very ""lush"" biography- very indicative of the time period in which it was written."
3,"Good info, but a difficult read","I read this book for a history class and although it contained good information about Gandhi, his life, and the steps he took to try to redeem his country and his people, it has a great deal of technical information and can be hard to follow at times. A fairly good knowledge of the political policies and figures in India, Africa, and Britain during the first half of the twentieth century would make the book much easier to read. I would not recommend this book for a casual reading."
1,Too Fast,You have to know all the steps and the pace is too fast during the warm-up. I think the moves are out-dated.
5,History of Irealnd,"This is an interesting, readible history of Ireland from earliest times until after the British left. It is broken into historical periods and the reader can dip in and out of the book. The author, Donegal man, Seumas McManus was a gifted storyteller and wrote many other Folk tales and short stories. Buy this book!."
1,dated,"This dated book is so full of inaccuracies and myths masquerading as history that your money is best spent elsewhere. For a good general history of Ireland, check out Kee or Moody."
4,Clarification of other reviews,"The reason that this work only covers up to the first part of the twentieth century is that it was first written in 1921, before Ireland even had independence from England. Mr. MacManus did not get ""tired"", he simply wrote this work before much of the twentieth century happened."
1,Not for notebooks,"Fine print on the back says ""not for notebook computer screens"", which still might be ok for some people, but it also says not for screens that have been factory pre treated with anti glare coating, which I think rules out just about any screen LCD or CRT made after about 1990.Not at all useful to me."
5,Monitor Cleaning Wipes,"The wipes are good quality. Their moisture has maintained, for a month, as good as new.Have no question at all."
3,Good but smaller than I expected,"The socks are as advertised in all but one respect: size.They are warm and tough and comfortable. But I found that I needed to buy one size larger than their chart to avoid having them so tight they left marks. In some settings, the constriction cut off skin circulation enough to make my feet cold and uncomfortable."
2,Thinner than I wanted,"I have several different ""weight"" of the ""Darn Tough"" brand socks, and NONE of them are as fragile and thin as these smart wool socks. They do not cling onto you very snug, yet the foot size seems a bit small. The product is very thin and I had wool felt coming off on the heel after walking about half a mile in some good broken in boots. These are a loose, sloppy sock. I will be sticking with Darn Tough socks, they are WAY worth the 2 extra dollars per pair."
4,Excellent way to connect with Kabbalah on an emotional level,Basic book not to be overlooked by people who have focused on the intellectual aspects of Kabbalah. Included within its pages are meditaions.
3,Why did I read this book?,"After reading the praise given the author by others I'm almost intimidated to report that this book was just too very much. I found it tiring, no exhausting is a better description and ultimately confusing. I felt in order to benefit from the information given I had to immerse myself in it to a depth I do not wish to go. Perhaps I just wasn't ready for it but then again..."
2,too much ranting,The authors kept on giving the same speech over and over again about the academic establishment. The constant ranting should have been handled once in the intro and then the authors should have gone on and made there point. It's to bad because when the authors actually focus on there interesting theory they have a potentually good book unfortunately they love to give there speech to much.
5,Surprisingly good,"I picked this book up not expecting much. I have been reading all kinds of books on the subject of ancient civilizations. While I tend to agree that the authors tend to stick it to the establishment it bit too much, they fact is they probably deserve it and then some. After reading this book I'm convinced and I now almost find it hard to believe people consider any other location for the ""mythical"" Atlantis other than Central America. Of course, the authors explain why the other proposed locations of Atlantis are more popular. I, for one, thing that people don't want to find Atlantis. If you look in the wrong places, you won't find it and you can keep having fun looking for it. In any case, this book was uncommonly reasonable and well thought out. Forget the spelling errors and repeated stabs at that status quo--this book is an important read."
2,Need some cheese for the whine..,"I am up to page 132...some good but old known data presented, which could be condensed to 5 pages. The rest is all complaint. No structured presentation of anything yet except a long recitation of personal grievances against archaeologists and some vague apparition Ivar Zapp and George Erikson have labelled the ""Church"". I suggest saving your money for ""Noah's Flood"" video and other info on Ballard's expedition to the Black Sea. For the authors, draw a line from Serpent Mound, Ohio leading from the snake's mouth, through the egg, and on past the Great Sphinx...what does it point to??Probably somewhere, sometime, but I gotta dig a varmint hole to hide in to avoid the next cataclysm so I cannot extrapolate...If you can present a theory somewhere before page 200 I might come out of my burrow...otherwise I just gonna go hide like the lowly mammal rodent you guys seem to favor."
3,Average,".... I don't think Atlantis in America is any different. It doesn't provide any startling answers, it just asks the same tired questions. How did the ancient Peruvians construct cyclopean walls without mortar or the wheel? Who or what created the stone balls of Costa Rica, and what was their purpose? The authors have a nice theory, but it isn't any more convincing than the next person's. Overall it isn't a terrible book, but it's not that great either."
3,The life and times of Henry II of England.,"This is a average summary of this great King of England. It summarizes the challenges Henry Plangagenet faced when he assumed control of the Kingdom and his consolidation of his holdings in France. Henry II was one of the true great rulersof his time, defying the Church and France to lead his realm. Since Barber wrote this book back in the sixties, it is not up to date on new research into Plantagenet rulers. Also Barber confuses the reader with the names of many people that were not a central theme of the King's time. The names are the most confusing aspect of this book, and thus the rating of three stars."
5,Must have library addition,"This book is the perfect children's book. I work at a preschool and have read hundreds of books over the years. This one is enchanting. The flow of the book is just right, very funny. Illustrations are a perfect match with the cadence of the story. If you want a book for your collection you must add this one"
4,Fun rhymes - Silly Story,"My three year old loves this story. Mrs. Brown lives with cow, two pigs, three ducks and a yak. When she goes to town, the animals play. The rhymes are enchanting and the illustrations made my daughter giggle. Her favorite picture is of the animals enjoying Mrs. Brown's food; the yak has doughnuts hanging on his horns. She ""reads"" this book repeatedly, chanting out ""a cow, two pigs, three ducks and a yak."""
1,Not what it seems...,This is not a performance dvd. It is instructional. All that is seen is one or two hands playing the parts of the concerto. There is a voice-over of instructions to the pianist.Very dissapointing.
2,Hummingbirds don't seem to love it,"We had another one with a perch and they seemed to like it much better. We are noticing they rarely use this one. Too bad, we love having them around the house."
4,Nice Zen lamps,"Great looking lamps. I got two, one for each bedside table. My only complaint is that the on/off switch is halfway down the power cable instead of three to four inches from the base of the lamp. Other than that, great product. If you are into Asian stuff these are for you."
2,Croaking Condor,"I bought the condor for a member of a group which has 'singing' birds. This member is the only male in the group, so I looked for a 'male' sound. But the croaking of the condor is too tame. Probably condors don't make much noise - have no idea.Can not give opinion on durability since the bird has only been one month with the owner, and is not handled much. Actually, the condor disappeared from the desk - maybe it flew away."
4,Item Description WRONG - 4 channels not 8,"Good automixer, but the description is for the SCM810, not the SCM410. There are only four channels on the 410, not eight."
2,Way overpriced.,"First off, theses sunglasses are noticeably of poor quality once you put them on. Visually you can literally see through the not so polarized lenses. I would not recommend anyone pay $40 for a pair of sunglasses which lack in quality."
1,"CHEAPLY MADE, OVER PRICED, POOR POLARIZATION AND GOT HEADACHES!","THE GOODSMALL SO YOU DONT GET THAT AWESOME SoCal EYEGLASS TAN ON YOUR FACE.LIGHT ON YOUR FACE.DONT SLIDE AROUND ON YOUR NOSETHE BADVERY CHEAP MATERIAL!POLARIZED POORLY. NOT GOOD FOR WORKING IN THE SUN ALL DAY OR ON THE WATER.GLARES EVERYWHEREHAD TO BUY OTHER GLASSES, HAD HEADACHES WEARING THESE TO THE POINT OF GOING TO THE DOCTOR. HE ASKED HOW LONG I BEEN WEARING THESE SUNGLASSES, FUNNY ENOUGH THE SAME AS THE HEADACHES. WENT AND GOT A DIFFERENT PAIR OF POLARIZED SUNGLASSES FROM ANOTHER COMPANY. NO MORE HEAD ACHES."
5,A Must for Serious Tatters,"Originally published in 1962, this is still the most readable history of tatting. Because the book is not actually a pattern book, inexperienced tatters may be somewhat frustrated at the gloriously beautiful photos with few instructions, although the photos are clear enough for an experienced tatter to use as the primary reference. The text is clearly written, sometimes with low-key humor, and rather entertaining to read. Anyone with an interest in tatting history and technique should have this book."
3,Excellent History...Not so Excellent for Patterns,"The first portion of the book is a fascinating history of tatting; however, I was hoping for more of a pattern book. While there are several patterns included in the book they instructions are unclear and hard to follow. I would recommend this book only for someone who is an advanced tatter looking for a reference work on the history of the craft or advanced advice on designing new tatting motifs."
4,"Fun series, but with some flaws","Griffin writes some classic war stories, where the men are men, the women mostly swoon, and the good guys win in the end. When the style works it produces some really fun reads, that mix reasonably well-researched factual events with good old fashioned covert ops stories. When it hits his flaws in style, he contradicts his own continuity, loses track of characterization, and gets a little bit too Mary Sue-ish with his favorite characters. Line of Fire is a classic example of this, covering both Guadlcanal, and a covert op on its periphery. Definitely a fun read, but it has its flaws."
2,not my cup of tea,"Just can't seem to get into this book. Enjoy reading Clive Cussler books, and after reading the reviews for this series, decided to give it a try. Story line skips around to much, to many characters makes it hard to keep up with. It's just not fun to read."
5,Beautiful wine flutes,The flutes are beautiful as one would expect from Waterford. They arrived in a timely manner and beautifully boxed. One of our original wine glasses was broken soon after our wedding so these were replacements 40 years later. My wife is of Irish ancestry making the gift even more appropriate. They are a beautiful wedding or anniversary memento.
3,A bit wordy,"This is an old fashioned story that I found rather long winded to be honest, and the dialect was hard to deal with at times. The premise is that a thief who has stayed below the radar for some time takes an opportunity to ""liberate"" a car - only to find a youngster inside. How he returns the boy and how it all works out in the end is played out in a series of misunderstandings and coincidences."
5,Star Spider Speaks,This book is very interesting. I bought it after I had my native american tarot cards read for me. I wanted to know more about the meaning behind the cards that were shown.
5,Enjoyable,I enjoyed using this orange filter for my sunrise and sunset shots....I think it is better to get the desired effect off camera rather than tweaking photoshop to post process your pictures......I love it!
3,Too many viewpoints,"Kalpakian is clearly a gifted writer, but she didn't use her talents to their fullest extent here. There were so many viewpoints and time shifts that I could not get a firm grasp on the characters or their stories. Every time I started a new chapter I'd have to flip back to refresh myself on who the characters were. This made it hard to get into the story and hard to care very much.The novel should've been longer to fully flesh out the characters, or she should've stuck to two or three storytellers.I'd like to check out some of her other novels to see what she can really do."
3,LOVED IT TILL THE END!,"I REALLY ENJOYED THE PREMISE OF THE BOOK. IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE THAT AFTER THE FACT, WHEN YOU PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE, YOUR TAKE ON THINGS CAN CHANGE. THE BOOK WAS GREAT AND HARD TO PUT DOWN UNTIL THE END. THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS JUST RUINED THE BOOK. WHO THEY THINK THE GROUP TEACHER IS IS TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE AND THE LAST CHAPTER TIES EVERYTHING UP IN A ""HAPPILY EVER AFTER MODE"". IT REALY RUINED THE BOOK."
3,The Memoir Club...,"If your a fan of women's fiction involving 'multiple women friends who all have their troubles in life, and talk to one another about them' (and there are MANY of these types of books out there)...then this is the book for you.Six women meet in a memoir writing class, and continue meeting after the class ends. Through writing their individual stories, they face challenges and heartaches they weren't quite prepared for, but make them stronger women in the long run.While a good story, there was nothing that really made this book stand out. It's similar to all the other books in its genre, though it did have a few surprises here and there. I was a little put off by the whole abortion clinic thing...but for the most part was satisfied with the outcome. In the end it was an OK read. Nothing outstanding, but also not a wast of time."
2,Waste of money and time,"I just received this book today and it took about 30 minutes to read through it. I'm afraid that there is nothing in this book that is even remotely helpful. While there are all sorts of tips about how to set up an office (e.g., which software to use, how to set up phones, etc.) all of the tips are so simplistic as to be worthless. The information in this book is just far too elemental. I expected to see more detailed information on things such as advertising, dealing with the administrative aspects of running a law office and growing the business. Instead, the author spent way too much time on which word processing software to buy and the various types of telephone systems. This book is not about setting up a law practice, it's a generic (and all too basic) guide to the obvious aspects of setting up any office."
4,Very Informative For New Lawyer,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about starting up their own law practice. First, reading the book gave me confidence to make the plunge by answering a lot of questions about what to expect in private practice. Second, the book gives great advice on what you should consider when selecting your area(s) of practice, and ways to develop those areas to be successful. Finally, there are a lot of nuts and bolts of setting up the practice, and establishing office procedures, that a new practitioner may not think about. You will pay for the book just by avoiding costly mistakes you may otherwise make."
1,Foonberg Extra Light,"This book was very light. If you really want to read a book with valuable information, read Foonberg's book. This book was primarily fluff and little substance."
5,Excellent =),"I have never written an Amazon review before, but when I heard this album I had to tell somebody about it! I absolutely loved it. The songs are beautiful. I only know a few words of Swedish but it doesn't make any difference.. This has quickly become one of the very favorite albums in my collection, and I've rarely been so excited about a record. I highly recommend it!"
4,Snow shovel that meets my expectations!,"Suncast SC5350 20-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher Combo with Ergonomic Shaped Comfort Grip Handle, No Stick Graphite Blade, And Wear StripWe've had good winter snowfall this season in Flagstaff. The local hardware stores were selling out of less friendly snow shovels so I used my Prime membership and had one delivered to my doorstep. So far I've shoveled probably 4-5 feet off our driveway with this new shovel. It is sturdy, yet light enough to not add to the work. The proof will be in how long it lasts. My last one (another, cheaper brand) cracked when levering some of the dense stuff the snowplows leave where our driveway meets the street. This shovel with its metal edge seems to handle that tough stuff very capably. I am a believer in 'ergonomic' handles because I've noticed they are easier on my back. You're doing enough to lift inches or feet of snow that can be light and fluffy or heavy as concrete. I suggest you try this shovel to make your winter labors easier."
2,Disappointed,"First of all don't go by the picture. The handle isn't bent in the vertical plane as shown in the picture, it is bent to the right for reasons that are obscure to the writer.When it came out of the box I initially thought it had been broken in shipment.I like to be able to throw snow to either side right or left and I believe it would be awkward given the handle angle. The graphite blade is really grey plastic as noted by others. The blade is held in place by one fastener but the blade has been formed with 2 holes but the second hole appear to be just filled with plastic and isn't in a position where it go into the handle."
3,Heavy snow pusher,"This is a heavy, sturdy shovel that should be used only for pushing snow. Good handle length so easy to use for those 6 ft and taller."
5,Good sturdy shovel. I bought just for the Ergonomic design!,"I purchased this snow shovel as a back-up to my Suncast SC3250 18-Inch shovel. I specifically got this for the ergonomic factor. We had a storm here in Cincinnati and there were none left in the stores! I'm about 6'2"" tall, so I still had to ""hunch"" over a little while shoveling, but not as a bad as before with a straight-handle design."
4,Good shovel but wish it were lighter,"Pros:Ergonomic handle really does reduce back strainNon-stick blade definitely helpsSturdy, well madeCons:Heavier than I would have preferredLike the other have already said, the ergonomically bent handle really does work.This is my second shovel with a bent handle. The problem with the first shovel was the snow keeps sticking to the plastic blade making it more difficult to through the snow off. So I bought this one to help lighten the load. While it does prevent snow from sticking it is much heavier then my plastic blade shovel so I didn't get as much benefit from this shovel as I had hoped. It is still helpfully to have non-stick blade because at least with each scoop of snow you know how much it's going to weigh and they helps makes shovel a little easier. Also, it's well made.If you can find it from Amazon.com directly without having to pay a fortune on shipping it's worth it."
1,An Insult to Mozart!,It is one thing to perform Mozart on period instruments. It is another to just bang away so unmusically.I couldn't believe how horrible the 1st movement of K.310 was played. The loudness of the left hand many times made the melody played by the right hand practically inaudible. I couldn't even make out the main theme the first time through.I got so turned off that I forwarded to Mozart's earliest pieces. Here the recorded volume was so low that the background noise of the clavichord was as loud as the music itself. Raising the volume only made things worse. This was so distracting that I just had to stop playing the CD.Do not purchase!
4,Forget Me Not,"Forget Me Not, the 5th book in the Christian series Aloha Cove, follows the lives of two stepsisters, Cass and Tabitha. In this novel, their boyfriends both leave for college, and they are both left to complete their senior year on Kwaj. Cass must deal with her mother's pregnancy. A new boy, Sam Steele, comes to the island, and makes friends with Cass and Tabitha. One of them likes him, and who will it be? While Cass is filled with remorse at the departure of Logan, Tabitha is relieved that her boyfriend, Micah, has left. This book deals with the changes many girls encounter during their teen years. I enjoyed this book, even though the diction is not very good. It strongly enforces Christian views and moral behavior."
4,What Must Be Said.,"This is a free Kindle ebook version of an old Norse epic poem. It is very well translated into a Kindle format, as there are no typos. It took about 25 minutes to download to my device, but that is not a real problem, because this is the largest file on my entire Kindle library. It's a good read, just be prepared to spend a lot of time on this as I have read a paperback version and the style of reading that you use on Kindle actually slows it down. If you have an interest in epic poetry, or Norse legends, then you need this book in one form or another."
4,Nice,These folders are a bit overpriced but they are nice looking and appear to be sturdy. Have to wait and see how long they last before I know if they are worth the cost
3,contact lenses in ophthalmic practice,It's a great book for contact lens practice beginners but wished it had many more pictures. The price is tooooo good.
2,Health,This is an interesting and effective protocol. i would recommend finding a practitioner and gaining training with which the potential reader would feel comfortable.
3,Super cute but they broke,"[[ASIN:B000PDOVV6 Two Lips Women's Trinity Peep Toe Pump]These shoes were super cute, and I got tons of compliments on them. I would wear them with jeans, with a skirt or dress pants. But there were a couple of problems.These shoes run really small. I usually wear size 7 or 7.5 and I got these in 7.5 and they were so tight that it was uncomfortable to wear them (but they were so cute that I tried anyway).They are not very durable. The strap across the center of the shoe broke before I had even had the shoes a month. The price was right though, and I would even buy them again if they had them in a bigger size."
2,Not that impressed,"Just received my shoes today and when I opened them they looked like they have been worn. The material of the shoes has wrinkles in it kind of like it's melting off, and one of the shoes has a crack in it. The actual design is cute, but it was a huge waste of money."
3,"Curious George, a fun book","Love the story, hate these new cheap paperback books. Curious George as usual gets into trouble at the campsite, but it is harmless fun! I bought this as a companion to a camping gear set I purchased for my grandson and he loves both."
1,Kindle Edition looks like an old Xerox,"The book itself is good, but the scan for the Kindle edition is black and white, and not a very good scan at that. If they fix this, then I would recommend the book."
1,illegible type,"Length:: 1:00 MinsI should have read the other reviews for the other Curious George kindle books. the type is illegible. Below the illegible type from the book, they have the text typed out. The pages repeat -- there are sometimes multiple pages from the book on one page in the ipad, and then each page is repeated again since the type is too small and blurry to read it the way they have scanned the book in -- and then the text is actually typed out on a page that does not match the picture. It's confusing. I want my 87 cents back."
1,Very poor quality,"My children are big fans of curious George stories. So, I tried the Kindle edition... This is theft! The book is scanned and the text is typed again. So you end up with small pictures, twice the text (once small and difficult to read, once adapted to the kindle) and a very bad experience. There are some curious George that are ""real"" ebooks, so you have to check before buying."
2,"Kids love it, I hate reading it","It looks like I'm in the minority here, but I really don't enjoy reading this book. I bought it because I wanted a book about camping since it's an activity that we do pretty often. I wanted to like it. But I just find the text really unpleasant to read. After reading it twice it went into our donations pile."
5,"German tempi, Baroque practices","Maestro zu Guttenberg achieves a convincing result in going back to the period instruments and embellishment practices. The tempi for most of the work is rapid and intense, though such pacing is relatively typical to the German interpreters. In the liner notes, zu Guttenberg emphasizes his attention to the practices of 1727 to 1736 (when the score was first performed and then somewhat revised). Perhaps the only aspect that is not typical to the composer's practices in Leipzig is that the soloists are not clearly culled from the chorus members. The soloists (Ullmann as Evangelist, Mertens as Jesus, with Korondi, Vondung, Güra, and Begemann), hardly household names in the U.S., are clear stand-outs. They should become better known in the U.S. in the future.The Urtext rendition includes several arias and recititives that may be left out of other editions. A fourth CD includes an interview of zu Guttenberg, in German."
5,"Spiders, Towers and Death, oh my","After reading the Desert I found out that there is a LOT of books in the series. So I decided to start buying up the hardcover books. The Tower has three of the stories in one. I am not sure if the paperbacks were published first or if the hardcover copies were first. But getting the hardcovers are cheaper in the end IF you plan to read all of them. And I do. The future of mankind, spiders and thought control. Who will become the masters of the Earth? Who should become masters of the Earth? Does the Earth need masters?"
1,Don't let the picture fool you,"Hi.If you look at the buyer's photo, the mold looks metal. Doesn't it? That's because the seller has cleverly put the CLEAR PLASTIC mold atop a black background. Rest assured, this mold is PLASTICAgain, mold is PLASTICWould you make chocolate candy bars in a plastic mold?"
3,don't take it too serious,"If you are looking for a scholarly study of the real Japan, this book is not what you want. It's still an interesting book to read though."
1,Barthes' Fantasy of Japan,"The first two chapters of Roland Barthesf Empire of Signs read like a wickedly irreverent farce on the dangerous of Orientalism. However, by the following chapter it becomes apparent that Barthes made the unfortunate mistake of believing his own rhetoric. Although a highly inventive and therefore wildly misinforming interpretation of Japan, the book can serve as an informative document in a historiographical study on Western reception of the fictive Other, in this case signified by gJapan.h"
2,Name Dropping,"There is no doubt that this book offers some good advice about being a father; however, I felt it was consistently ""name-dropping"" various professional baseball stars. I often wondered the value of the story if it was not about Vida Blue (for example). An avid baseball fan would enjoy the short stories, but it was a bit much for me. If you want a great (short) book on being a father (or a working mom), check out ""The Sixty Minute Father"", by Parsons."
4,As a newcomer a good book but a little too advanced for me,"I'm a newcomer, just starting to study Wicca and the Goddess Path this book is very good and yet a little bit advanced for me! It's well-written and the style really enjoyable.. I really like this book."
1,Sadly I must disagree,"Sadly, this book has a number of inaccuracies and is poorly researched. It is obvious that the Ferrars rely to heavily on Robert Graves and his mythological theories, many of which have been debunked by better scholarship. The rituals were bordering on insulting, especially the Greek ones. It is obvious that they have never read a book on greek religion. Additionally, they tend to be very heavy-handed on the opinion, and not as interested in fact as one would expect from the Ferrars. If you want books on myth, please pass this one up."
4,interesting and informative,This is a great way to become more aware of the Goddesses and is different than any other I have read. The rituals in it are also good.
3,Had to put it down....,"There are many inaccurate and wildly made statements in this book. When I saw the farrar's name on it, I thought it would be an amazing book. Part I was great, giving a general history of the goddess, and her many repsonsibilities. But even in there, there was a whole chapter basically devoted to debunking christianity, that I had to turn the page....and I was born Jewish! Then when I read the histories of each goddess, I really had to stop. I definitely expected more...The trouble is there aren't too many general books on the goddess. It's a good thing that I just stick with one, whom wasn't well represented either."

3,Dutch Girls,"A funny little movie about young adoleslent boys from a strict prep school hockey team headed for Amsterdam. Colin is so adorable, and quite the gentlemen but very naive. The head master and the coach have ideas on how the young men should behave and represent the school. However, the young men have other ideas and it's presented in the title of the movie. Their antics before getting to Amsterdam and after were funny and delightful, just wasn't enough. His roommate in Amsterdam was just histerical. It was delightful to see Colin at a much younger age, and one can see how he has matured to the handsome and talented man he is today."
3,Innocent story-tell,"A group of 18+ school-boy-characters played by about 30y.o. actors went to Holland where more hints than actions happened as they interacted with local gals.Probably, it was so near-innocent in pre-Beatle era also such a phenomena could hardly appear in the chastity-filled vacuum.Handsome mostly boys present different trends among which hypocrisy and cheating the best friend to do own way is the most.I am wondering one could pay a DVD price required."
3,Dutch Girls,"This is a cute little movie. An opportunity to see some actors when they were just starting--Colin Firth, Timothy Spall, James Wilby, Adrian Lukis. The boys from a Scottish public school take a trip to the Netherlands and try to get lucky, with little success. Love the very graceful last scene."
1,UNWATCHABLE,This copy of the Dutch Girls is unwatchable. It is pixelated beyond belief! Freezes and after 5 minutes into the movie I am sending it back to Amazon.Strangely there is no PAL copy of this to buy instead.A shame because I am a fan of Bill Paterson.
3,"Young Firth, Young Spall and others","A certainly harmless take on young English boys, off on an adventure, with restrictions from their chaperone/coach, played by Bill Paterson. A rather clumsy group of field hockey players from a boys' boarding school get the chance to go play their counterparts in Holland. They want the adventure of drinking, partying and meeting girls much more than playing their sport.This film is the old story of teenage boys coming of age, so that part is a lot of seen-it-before.It is mostly interesting because of the very young Colin Firth and Timothy Spall, later to become icons of British acting. Both are very good, as is usually the case with these two very fine actors who, of course, went on to greater performances later in their lives.Firth was around 24 and Spall 27 or 28 when they made this, both playing 17 or 18-year old boys. Baby faced Firth carries it off very well."
3,You know what they say about Dutch girls,"Hockey players from a Scottish prep school head to Amsterdam for a tournament and the boys, all big talkers but completely inexperienced, expect to make time with the local girls despite the watchful eye of their nerdy chaperone (Bill Paterson). Shy Neil (Colin Firth) finds himself attracted to a lovely young blonde while oafish Lyndon (Timothy Spall) turns out to be the Lothario of the group.This 1985 film is mainly a chance to see a very young Colin Firth in action. While he's not nearly the heartthrob he would later become, he's still sweet and sympathetic. The action revolves around him, however, and he's often just a spectator. The spotlight is really shared by Paterson as the hilariously strict yet clueless coach and Spall who is quite convincing as a slovenly rich kid. James Wilby is also good in a small role.The script doesn't break any new ground, but it's a pleasant, lightweight film about the trials of growing up that will bring a few smiles."
2,Make the wooden deck board flaming hot.,"If you have a low pit, this mat might not protect the deck. It is a fire hazard waiting to occur it you use it with a low pit stand. We ended up using it on the spare grill with a high stand."
2,The terrorists,"Scence september 11, the USA has been changed forever by the attacks on america. The twin towers, The Pentagon and all the lifes lost will be remeber forever. But as horrific as it may seem, the terrorism has been causing pain for many people in many centuries. In the book ""The Terrorists"", you will learn that terrorist have been around for 10 centuries. From the Muslim Assassins to the nazi's to the KKK. Did you know in the south terrorism was excepeted?They called it KKK. This book talk about the history of terrorism and where it has come from and who are the leaders of some these groups. This is a good book."
2,"Lots of characters, little substance","By the time you'll be able to keep track of all the characters' names it's too late to care very much about them in this nostalgia-ridden tale of time-travelling, magick-wielding teens turned adults, trying to figure out who's messing with their pasts on the eve of their high school reunion. The book starts off cruising on an endless stream of pop culture references, slides into flashbacks and time travel, only to come to a halt with a couple of fight scenes and plea for forgiveness. There's a lot of detail here, but not a lot of depth--the boys may be back in town, but I hardly felt that any of these main characters really cared about what they came back for. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for high school nostalgia, but this reads more like the Cliff Notes version of true feeling and memory."
5,"Fun ride, some twists, highly recommend.","I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The characters are very believable, dialogue natural. It reads like good fiction from the start. Then a bit into it it gets a... little stranger, while maintaining that natural, believable, natural feel.This works great. The book doesn't ever jump off that click to pure fantasy, it stays grounded in reality, or rather the unreality of what is going on is just as unreal, though undeniable, to the characters.The only negative thing I could say about this book is the last 1/3rd made me stay up way too late. Couldn't stop this book once it got it's momentum going.Great job!"
1,Secrets,"First published in 1983, this lyrical novel, superficially straightforward but full of stories within stories, first brought Bernard MacLaverty's work to public attention. In the novel, a young Irish Republican Army operative who wants to break the cycle of violence seeks out a woman whose Ulster policeman husband he helped to murder. As their relationship grows, so do Cal's guilt and sorrow, until, in the end, he is forced to make a sacrifice of himself in order to gain redemption. Rich in ideas and history, this book helps us understand the situation in Northern Ireland--which ""is not just there,"" MacLaverty has remarked, ""as a colorful background."""
5,The most sold album in German language ever,"Here are the reasons to buy this CD: First, BAP is the most successful German singing band whose albums since 1981 went to No. 1 within 2 weeks and sold platin without any exceptions despite their strange Cologne slang. Second, ""Vun drinne noh drusse"" (= Von drinnen nach draussen) from 1982 is still the most sold album in German language and definitely one of the best ever. Pure German rock combined with ironic, sometimes angry, sometimes melancholic texts. Powerful political protest songs such as ""Kristallnaach"" as well as ""Zehnter Juni"" are followed by romantic or melancholic ballads such as ""Do kanns zaubre"", one of the best lovesongs ever written in German, or the sad ""Ah`ner Leitplank"" about a deadly car accident. For non-German speakers: Never mind the language barrier (Even Germans have sometimes problems with the slang, so that all texts are generally translated in ""School German""), the music on its own is worth it a million times."
1,Fake Price,2 days ago this item was listed for $50. I ordered it and the order was confirmed. This morning I got an email saying the order was cancelled. I returned to this web site to see the item had been marked up to $129. Beware - not sure this site is legitimate.
2,"after initial hiccup, pleased with product","Initially I was shipped the wrong product, but with a phone call they acknowlegded their error and promptly shipped me the correct one. Good customer service and I would order from theem again."
1,You get what you pay for! Buy the HP name brand,I bought this thinking that I was going to save my company some money on printing cartridges. Well when I installed it gave me a black line on the paper along the whole edge. I will buy an HP ink cartridge next time.
3,Did not receive what is advertized,"I did NOT receive exactly what is advertised here. This shows a retail packaged Q7553X cartridge in the blue themed box. What I received was a ""Contractual LaserJet Toner Cartridge"" with the number Q7553XC. According to the HP website, there is no difference except the packaging and who is allowed to sell the ""XC"" version. This merchant ought to send what is advertised. [...]"
5,Make Sure you get genuine HP!!!,After servicing printers for the last 15 yr. I can tell you that 75% of the mechanical printer failures I saw were because of after-market re-manufactured cartridges. Do yourself a favor and only buy Genuine HP.
5,What a great buy!,This table is fabulous! The delivery was much earlier than I expected (by several days) and I was therefore able to use it as a banquet table for a party. I love the fifth leg which I have never seen mentioned in any other reviews. The leaves were flush to each other with no gaps. And the price was great with no shipping costs!! The color is true oak look. What a great buy!
2,It needs support when opened for 4 places,This table is actually lopsided when opened to four places. It clearly needs support on one side. It looks good as a console but had two leaves that take up a lot of space. Not recommended.
4,Great buy!,Table was as advertised. Easy to assemble - just attach legs. Looks great and saves a lot of space.color was as depicted.
2,Not the best product but OK for an amateur,I bought these because I am disabled and have been trying to learn to do different crafts and just basic playing around with building things. I remembered a friend of mine (An airplane mechanic) had a pair of these (Not this brand) to twist wire together. If you are looking for a cheap pair of twisters this is a good product... however the design of the lock doesn't hold very well under tension (it tends to come loose at very inopportune times). However since I am not a professional it will work for the small rinky-dink projects I bought it for. I would suggest going with one of the more expensive types that would have a little better locking mechanism on them.
1,Chinese Junk,"I ordered Safety Wire pliers and received a tool which was asymmeterical and would not properly close, cut or lock. I called the third-party vendor and complained and was told I could send them back, which I did. I have yet to hear anything more."
1,Return to sender!!!,"I have a 9"" safety wire pliers I got out of the salvage dump when Miramar was a Naval Air Station. It was chipped and the spring had been removed because it was a FOD Hazzard. An old school Aircraft Mechanic filed the tip 30yrs ago & It's been with me ever since. I purchased this one since I've been on the line for a while & ""the smaller the tool pouch, the better."" This unit never left my garage, I was happy to pay $5.50 & return it to sender... I will only enter one fault, because there were ""MANY."" The locking portion was only working when I took it out of the package, after that the pliers could only be locked by holding it tight. I'd rather go back & get my Duckbill pliers, it's 100% better. I'm going to spend the cash & get a pair of Snapon's."
5,Great Book,"This book is about the Civil Rights struggle in my hometown of Savannah, Georgia. I used to read this book in the library all the time because I could'nt take it out of the library. I still love it!"
4,Oh! Rock de Cologne,"When I discovered this marvellous music from rock-band BAP I was working in Germany at the time, and when I commented about this CD to my colleagues their response was something along the lines of BAP who?BAP, for me at least, are one of the finest and one of the oldest contemporary rock bands in Germany and this is just an example of their prodigious output in a history which has spanned more than twenty years and simply goes from strength to strength.BAP sing in a dialect of German found in the area around Cologne and it takes a bit to understand the lyrics for a non-native German speaker with very little idea of this dialect, however, the music more than makes up for that.So if you haven't yet discovered this great unknown tradition which is BAP then buy this or anything else they have done recently, you might just think that you too have made a major discovery.regards,martyn_jones@iniciativas.com"
1,"I purchased this trumpet, it sounds great, but it fell apart in days","I purchased this trumpet for my son. It sounded great for the first few days. Then it began to fall apart. It started off with an innocent sticking valve. My son oiled the valve. A few days later, the oil no longer helped. I took the trumpet to the local repair shop. When the repair tech looked over the instrument, he indicated that it was made from a very poor quality of metal that bent and scratched easily. He also showed me the bad welding work that was done to either repair or just build the valve. After a quick demonstration of this trumpet against a well-made trumpet, this trumpet will look like the toy that it is. Because of the poor quality of craftsmanship, the repair tech did not want to waste his time or my money trying to fix it."
1,Format Follies,"What I thought would be the Large Print Edition turned out to easily rival the Yellow Pages of a small city. This edition is massive, measuring almost 8"" by 10"", with type face of about -- I'd guess -- 16 point. My elderly mother took one look at it and asked how one was supposed to hold it: she was right, of course. It's too heavy for frail hands and arms, and the only way to read it is to lay it out on a table. Disappointing, especially when there exists a whole series of Large Print Editions of these mysteries which are perfect in every way -- which is what I thought I would receive. There isn't enough information in the description of the edition to warn other prospective buyers of this folly -- or that this might be exactly what they want."
3,Worth looking for!,"I discovered this book many years ago in an old used book store and enjoyed it thoroughly. I've read it several times since, particularly the chapter on ""The Pacific Paradise"" which evokes tropical island daydreams and the ""Rumor and the Mad Ghoul"" chapter which is one of the funniest stories I've ever read."
4,It changed.,"I use to drink this years ago, but now it is different. It wasn't gross just not as good as it use to be!"
1,Clumpy Mess,This stuff was horrible. Mixed it in a bottle with milk and the stuff was a clumpy mess that tastes like chalk. I recommend the pre made shakes. They are much better and tastier
1,Causes abdominal issues,"After use daily over several weeks I began to have significant abdominal distress . Muscle milk light is much better, less filler and no pain!"
1,Wrong Product,"Nutrition info says that its 25 gm protien which its not, its 20. And also per the nutrition tab it has hardly any carbs, which again is not true, it has 24 gms of carbs."
4,"Good taste, difficult to mix","I did like the taste of all three varieties of mix, even with just water as the liquid. I don't drink milk, and soy milk just doesn't seem to work at all with the protein shakes. The only problem I had with the shakes was all the shaking. I spent a good 5 minutes trying to mix up the whole packet, and I was using a shaker I picked up from GNC. I think they work great as a supplement, especially at about 2:30 in the afternoon when you get a little grumbly stomach."
3,"Good if you are not a ""sensitive"" drinker","I usually buy the ready-to-drink Myoplex. They are great for people like me who can't stand the taste of protein shakes. I decided to try the powder because I had a great experience with the ready-to-drink mix. However, I found the shake to be very thick and a bit too sweet. I couldn't get it down. I gave it to my husband."
4,pretty good!,Came on time and as described. Individual packets are nice. Decent taste. I haven't tried any of the other flavors so I can't compare.
2,This is no Netter's.,"If you have a choice, buy Netter's Atlas instead. Even if this book is required for your anatomy course, get Netter's. This Atlas was required for our medical school anatomy course and the entire class hated it."
3,Good.. but not the best.,"Grant's 10th atlas is improved in illustration than 9th. But its illustration is still unclear. Anyway, this 9th edition is good, but the best anaromy atlas is the Sobotta's."
4,My Vote is for Netter,"I own Grant, Netter and others. Over the years I have used Netter more than any others. Take Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, for example, Netter will show you why there can be atrophy at the thenar as it shows the details of the nerves in and out of the carpal tunnel. The book version is excellent. I just wish that Netter has a better CDrom version."
2,Agree that Grant's is not Netter's,I am a medical student in Ohio- I bought this book because it was recommended by the school- I kept hearing the other student's talk about how great Netter's atlas was so I bought it and haven't been sorry since-
3,Interesting concept. More than a dozen authors = one novel.,"A book written by a bunch of North Carolina authors, each writing one chapter. As a NC native I had to see what this book was all about. The book lacked depth and jumped around. However, it was worth the read just to see how this large a group of authors work with one another. Also, if you live or have lived in the Triangle area, you'll recognize the scenery of this novel."
5,Wholesome fiction for all the family!,Richard Paul Evans uses his simple story-telling style to share these heart-warming tales. I loved every word and found this collection to be easy to read. He uses language to paint a vivid picture of the characters and events. I couldn't put it down! I would recommend this collection to anyone who wants a spiritual boost!
5,God must be smiling ...,"i couldn't put the book down! i felt everything the characters felt. i was so absorbed in my reading, i forgot i was at the laundromat and started to cry. whether you're christian or not, this book helps bring the focus back to the greatest commandment: love one another."
5,A 'Forever' Treasure,"Everyone should read this book and keep it alongsde Tuesday's With Morrie. Mr. Evans has recognized his blessing from God which few of us take time to do. In recognizing his gift from above, he has movingly reached out to share his blessing with us through his deeply moving story. A book that once started cannot be put down until it is finished. A book that will always be lovingly remembered once read."
3,thanks,rec'd the book in time for Christmas--thanks for the quick turnaround on the order. it was in great condition.
3,KIND OF A LET DOWN,I THOUGHT THAT I WAS PURCHASING A LENGTHY XMAS STORY.SETTLING IN--I SOON DISCOVERED THAT I COULD READ THIS IN JULYAND GET THE SAME RUSH OUT OF IT. YEAH--YEAH---THERE IS SOME XMASTHERE---BUT---NOT A HUGE DOSE. NOT BIG ENOUGH TO PUT WITH THE OTHERXMAS BOOKS THAT I HAVE. AND THE STORY---????---IT WAS SEMI-TOO SAPPY.
1,I didn't get what all the fuss was about,"I had heard so much about how great these stories were. I found them extremely drawn out. I kept waiting for the point. It isn't a bad story or message, but it really isn't very in depth at all. It was simple, romanitcized and not well developed. I felt as if I were watching the characters from a distance--that I never really truly knew any of them. I found these stories dissappointing."
2,just ok,"while i really liked the message of the story and was very moved by it, i truly hated how it came to be revealed. sure, there is a bit of fantasy involved in this story--that didn't bother me. but as i noted already, it's the way this message is revealed so unneccesarily slowly as if the author was trying to build suspense that bothers me...also for such a short story, the chapter titles made me feel like i was reading a plot line with embellishments. i felt that they really ruined the simplicity of the story by chopping it up needlessly. the writing really rubbed me the wrong way.otherwise, it's a nice-ish story."
3,The Christmas Box,"I thought the book ""The Christmas Box"" was pretty good. It is not that long. It has about one hundred pages.I thought the book was interesting. I recomend this book to girls.I do not think that to many boys would like it.This book took me about three weeks to read. This book takes place in the winter in December. The book is kind of sad because an old lets a family with not a lot of money move into her house with her and she ends up dieing on Christmas Eve."
1,For Hobby Use,"For those who play table tennis as a serious sport and use your own custom paddles, they're likely not going to fit in this case. If you're using a pre-made hobbyist paddle this'll work, or if you're using a penhold paddle this will also fit. Otherwise, stay away and spend the extra 3 bucks on a case that fits all. The protection is fine, just too short of a case."
3,Serves its purpose,"3 stars because it is not bad but it is not great. It fits my Stiga Eurotech paddle snugly, but it has a zipper pocket in the front for which I can't find a purpose. Good product all in all."
4,shipping,when i got this there was a cut in the pocket (problably from packing it) it made the pocket useless but the case fits great and my paddle shows no wear and tear from my backpack. If it hadnt had that cut would have been Five stars.
4,paddle cozy,"i play quite a bit of ping pong and have a top-of-the-line paddle which, i felt, should be protected when not in use.Overall, it is a decent thing at a good price. i like to think it is extending the life of my paddle, though i do not have proof. the zipper has snagged, on more than one occasion, the inner lining and it is now ripped, potentially because the fit is very snug. i keep one ball in the pocket and have not had any issues with indents on my paddle (the pocket zipper is slightly meaningless - those balls will not fall out).overall, most people who see me coming with my paddle cozy laugh and think it's a pretty insane thing to do. that's fine. i am happy with this product."
3,Too Tight,"The cover barely fits my racket. I had to strech the cover a bit before I was able to fit my racket.It would have been better design if they made it 1-2 cm bigger length-wise. Other than that, this looks good."
4,Cheap but good,"I do not own Stiga racket (I have butterfly racket) but since this racket cover was cheaper than the butterfly one, I bought this one. Very good, solid padding to protect the racket. I know some racket cover has small pocket for ball or other small items, this cover does not have any pocket."
5,Very Fast!,Good product with very fast shipping. This is a nice racket cover especially considering the low price. A great value.
2,Racket Cover came without the paddle (Not in stock),Bought this product along with Paddle and both of them are packaged separately. Paddle was not available and hence Amazon cancelled the order. Cover without the paddle is useless but returning is a pain hence bought the paddle elsewhere and used this cover. Had more cancelled orders in the past year through Amazon
4,"Not bad, not bad at all...","Dr. Ken's is the first non-fluoride toothpaste I've used. I decided to give it a try because it's made from all natural ingredients.Although the flavor claims to be ""wintergreen"", it taste more like a stevia-flavored tea. The brown gel isn't very overpowering. It seems a bit weaker than some of the top namebrand flouride toothpaste (Colgate, Crest). There is also less foam when brushing with this gel, so you won't look like Cujo if you enjoy using a lot of paste.The taste of food isn't distorted like it would be after brushing with minty toothpaste. I was pleasantly surprised when I drank orange juice after brushing with Dr. Ken's- It tasted the way orange juice should taste!Bottom line, I think it's a good product. However, if you desire a stronger toothpaste that will give you a ""fresh breath"" feeling, this particular product may not be the thing to purchase."
3,Soft and plush but has it downside too,"The Wamsutta Centennial washcloth is thicker than the other brands I've tried, it hasn't lost its shape and it has kept it's color quite well. However, I can only use it once before it gets a smell that I can only describe as mildew like. Never having had this problem with any other brand of washcloth I can only assume it isn't anything I am doing to cause this, but a characteristic of the cloth. If I were one who washed after every single use, then yes I'd buy it again."
2,With Reservation,"It took me several years before I could hold a copyof this book by Harold Wilkins. An amateur Historian,he compiled some phenomena and intrigues in Mysteriesof Time and Space.The style of writing is a little bit difficult becauseof Wilkins fondness of interrepting his story telling byinserting trivias in between. Furthermore, the Authorfailed to cite his main sources or limited them to thosewhich would support his personal views. This in the caseof Barbara Ubyk.Wilkin's stauch anti-catholic view had further damagedthe presentation of the book. Readers already know theverdict without trial."
5,"I laughed, I cried, and I learned","I began reading Doris Drucker's book, thinking I would see if I enjoyed it. I did not put it down until I finished it. Wow . My son picked it up and had the same reaction. It is a fascinating portrait of a moment and place in time. I felt I was there, in her aristocratic setting watching the details of Germany and England in the 30s; and then to see America in the 40s and 50s through her eyes was entertaining. I often found myself laughing with her incredible sense of humor."
4,Works fine,Put these on my two vans and really appreciate them. Now I can leave my windows cracked open and not have the rain come in.
4,Great Glass,"Just purchased this lens and was very impressed with it. Shot a few macros and the quality is great. I looked very hard at the Canon 100 F2.8 Macro but didn't like the price.It wasn't a hole lot more than this lens but I'm in it to save money and still get some good quality. These days it seems like you have to pay an arm and a leg to get anything good. So I'm really glad I found this glass. I love to shoot macro and this lens can give me great images. It has great clarity and color. It's very impressive to me. I've spent almost $5000.00 on Canon glass in the last two years and I'm just photo hobbiest. I know you are saying why spend that much for a hobby but this may someday be a full time hobby for me. Get this lens, you won't be sorry for what you get. I will post some images soon I took with this glass."
3,Fine medium-priced waders.,"Although basic, no frills model, the construction of these waders is very good and compared to much higher priced brands (Orvis) a far better value."
1,This book does NOT teach how to massage a cat,"I like this book and it's very funny, but the title is misleading. It's a collection of tongue-in-cheek illustrations, but not only do they not teach you how to massage your cat, they would actually be physically damaging (like ""pull your cat's arms out to the side and give a sharp tug""). I could recommend the book, but buy it ONLY as a joke, and then also buy one of the many other books on the market that really do teach you how to massage your cat."
5,Tears of Laughter,"I found a rather worn copy of this book in a sea front book shop in Brighton recently and my tears of laughter created an orderly queue behind me of people wondering what on Earth I was laughing so hard at. As a cat lover and a ginger cat owner, it was my vision of testing the practice out on my own cat, along with his reaction, which made me erupt -- and with each turning page I became more and more helpless to conceal my laughter. I'm so glad it isn't out of print, it will make a most excellent present for my cat-loving friend."
2,"Not my thing, but others seem to like it","I didn't find this book all that funny, but then, that's just me. I'm sure any potential buyer can get the gist of what the book's about from reading these reviews, so if this sounds like it's up your alley then go for it.I do think it's silly to claim anyone who doesn't like this book is an idiot. The images do depict an animal being hurt - certain people will never like seeing pictures of that, even if they know it's a joke. So some people are turned off by violent images in general and others don't mind as long as it's all clearly in absurd good fun - that doesn't mean one group has no sense of humor, or that those who are not bothered by the images can't enjoy the book."
1,How to Massage Your Cat,"We unfortunately ordered this book as a christmas present for our cat adoring mother who was seriously interested in feline massage. What a shock to find it a big joke concerning felinicide. We were disgusted, it was not funny or even clever. Readers beware."
1,Yuck,"My sister and I both ran across this book yesterday, and I have to concur with her review below. So what if you know full well it's meant to be a joke? A step by step illustrated guide to choking and slowly, painfully killing a helpless animal just isn't funny. Maybe if you have a history of starting small fires and slicing up live mice in your basement, but otherwise, not so much."
4,Now I know where Frasier's ideas came from,"I love the sitcom ""Frasier"". Picadilly Jim is like a pre-TV book version of that show. The mixed-up identities and the ensuing situations had me laughing out loud several times. Very entertaining and an easy read."
2,Badly packaged...,"JoyRide, when it came out, was new, different, and interesting. Good choice. Swimfan, well the guy's an idiot ,but it's a new mix on the old fatal attraction formula. Wrong Turn. This one stumps me. Not at all original - and with eliza dushku, what would you expect? the video store is filled with low budget, stupid movies like this with similar titles... The vanishing is the one I don't know anything about, there should be a description. If you want something scary but original enough to buy, get Final Destination, Joyride, and pick something else"
5,Enjoyable!,One of the better books for learning the language because they use complete sentences not verb conjugation and words. This is the only way to learn a foreign language properly and the way they should be teaching it in schools.Merci Beaucoup!
2,communicating in french,"Not conversation manual, but vocabulary lists or dictionary. No exercises or activities for interactive learning. No i aginative use of vocabulary lists. However, exhaustive lists of specific topics."
3,What the...?,"I bought one and was so impressed I bought a second one. What's confusing is that they are not the same. The first one found the frequency I had been using previously. It plays through all the tunes in order. If you shut it off it picks back up where it left off at the beginning of the tune. Annoying but acceptable.The second one is another story. It will play your music along with the first fm station on the dial. You must find the frequency each time you power up. And that's not all. It goes back to the very first tune on your list each and every time. It would have been good to get some literature with the product. That way I would know which one is working properly. I would have bought a third but Which one would I get? Maybe I'd get one that's entirely different from either. The price is right, but instructions should accompany any multi-function product."
2,Not good,Hi....the sound coming out of it is not clear ....I do not recommend it to any human being !!!Thanks..
