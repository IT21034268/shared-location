2,A Wrong Direction,"Andrea, I'll follow wherever you go. Always. However painful. And this is painful. An electronic Kate Bush is the immediate comparison that springs to mind. But without the melody. This is mediocre electronic pop focussing on rhythmn at the expense of melody. And where did that voice we know and love go?"
1,TEN FEET TOO HIGH!!,"I have been a fan of the CORRS forever and even went to BOSTON to see them live. Had a great time! So when they broke up, I was a little sad but it was a great ride and I had heard that they wanted to really engage in their respective families. No harm in that right? So when I heard that Andrea was releasing a solo lp....I couldn't wait.THEN I HEARD THE LP and was totally ruined on her. THIS IS THE REASON WHY A BAND (and her brothers direction) ARE MUCH NEEDED. I respect Andrea wanting to branch out but this album is not only under produced, it is unweighted, unlistenable and even annoying at times. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE CORRS....DO NOT BUY THIS LP!!"
2,Does not meet expectations,"Even though I had read several negative reviews of the album, I decided to buy it because I loved the Corrs and I wanted to give her a fair chance. However, having listened to the album numerous times I must admit that the criticism was justified. Andrea neither developed the music of her band any further nor did she create anything that could be decribed as her style. The album has a few ""nice"" songs, but none of them is outstanding, touching, or really exciting, and overall the album sounds just mediocre. Considering where she comes from and what great music The Corrs made, the album is disappointing."
2,"someone please call Jim, Carolyn, and Sharon, ...fast!","I have been a long time Corrs fan and natually had to purchase this disc. If you are someone who was a Corrs fan and am considering to experience a small piece of essence of that work from this release, you will be very disappointed. Gone are the beautiful melodies of the group, the passionate solo vocal work of Andrea. Perhaps it is the new direction/genre she has taken, electro pop/whatever, but in the Corrs work it seemed as Andrea was required to stretch her vocals, or maybe the subject matter of Ireland's struggles assisted to provide a better vocal platform. I found the vocals on this release, lazy and very flat."
4,A Fan Since 1996....,"First of all, I have all The Corrs albums from 1996 up to Borrowed Heaven. I like other great bands to like christian singer, Rebecca St. James etc. I don't have this album yet. Not sure if I will get it or when I will get it. Might end up waiting until the band sing another album together. Ever since the 'Runaway' song in 1996's album, I have been a fan of The Corrs. Neat thing is Andrea Corr is the same age as me, and both are birthdays are in May. Not to mention Im still a single man at age 33. If I get this album, Im sure it will be pretty good. I've read some negative reviews, not sure it there truely put, or not :-/"
5,Cute and functional,"I like this because it's unique. I bought a different clip for myself and so many people have commented on it that I decided to make this my signature ""new baby gift""."
3,not exactly as pictured,"For an Irishman who is also a harpist this an important flag. One can't see from the illustration there's lots more detail on the body of the harp, not done very well, really, either. Should have left it simple. It's ok to hang inside...better than nothing."
5,AMAZING!,"I don't care what your musical preferences are, Brian Kennedy's voice is just amazing. I saw him in concert in Ireland last week and he was just such a fab entertainer that I immediately had to go out and buy all his albums. Also a very nice bloke. After the concert, he hung around outside to take photos with the fans and have a chat.It also says something about a singer when the government commission him to do a song to promote the peace process in Northern Ireland (Life, Love & Happiness).Listen to this guy's voice. He's just simply amazing."
2,Not Wide,"This is not a wide moulding hook. In fact, out of the 4 different kinds of moulding hooks I bought (since I couldn't tell what size any of them were) this package of four hooks turned out to be the smallest and thinnest! They did not fit my moulding. The dimensions on the package say the round part that goes over the moulding is 5/8"", and the hook is 1/2""."
3,3.5 Stars: A Bit of a Letdown,"I have all the Zits' treasuries, and while I enjoyed this latest one, have to admit that it was the least entertaining of the bunch. Some of the jokes are retreads of previously done jokes from other books, and unlike previous collections there weren't any strips that segued together to form a storyline. I was also disappointed to see so many one panel strips, like Family Circus.Entertaining, but not as good as previous compilations."
5,Laugh out loud funny,"If you have a 15 year old son (or know someone who does) you'll think the authors have you (or them) on cadid camera. So many times my husband and I looked at each other AFTER we finished laughing as if to say, ""that just happened here!"".We used to clip the comic strips to send to our son when he was in college. Turns out his roommates' parents were clipping them and sending them, too!Now that he is a recent graduate and living far away from home, he still gets a few clippings from time to time.This book is wonderful when you need a laugh!"
3,not spike lees best,im a big fan of spike lee but this movie isnt all that great i guess my expectations where too high.
4,RIVETING!,"First of all this movie had a good introduction that kept my attention. The actors Mekhi Phifer and Delroy Lindo did a great job. So did Isiah Washington. I think this movie is one of those hood classics that should rank up there with Menace II Society and Boyz N The Hood. If you think it's that kind of movie though, you're wrong. Because this movie is set in a different location and different situations. I think this movie has a greater message than Menace II Society, bout equal with Boyz n The Hood. The movie kept my attention well and I thought all the characters were believable. This movie is more like a cop and robber/crime drama more than Boyz N The Hood or anything. I think everyone should go rent this movie and watch it and then write a review about it. I would even like people to e-mail about this movie."
4,One of Spike Lee's Better Joints!!,"Spike Lee gives the viewer to this film a vision that many black youths from the projects in Brooklyn and other impoverished areas already know. They have no hope and no drive to improve their livelihood even if they try to. Spike does give his audience the chance to say, ""what can I do to stop it?"" Though it could have done better without the off-color humor, the peformances of Harvey Keitel and newcomer Mehki Pfifer sets the tone and level of the movie. This not for the faint of heart with all the violent imagery. It's a powerful film that I recommend fully."
5,Spike's best.,Burns itself into your brain. Great cinematography by MalikHassan Sayeed. On the same level as the book; both are so vivid thatthey actually drain you. Watch it.
2,Fair to middlin',"I'd probably like this movie a lot better if I didn't feel it was such a disservice to the novel it's based on.Delroy Lindo does give a standout performance as Rodney, but I just wasn't that impressed with Keitel. I guess it's a testament to Price when I say that the Rocco Klein of his novel felt more lifelike, more deeply conflicted, and more rounded than Keitel's Klein seemed on screen.I found it irritating that there were certain surreal elements added to the script which seemed to compromise the grittiness of the story. The additions didn't make the movie funnier, they just made it strange.As a side note, less than ten years old, the soundtrack already seems incredibly dated.Don't even rent this one, go read it. If you're dead set on spending your loot, buy two copies of ""Do the Right Thing."""
3,Don't forget to rinse,You'll want to cut the larger sections and rinse the grit off them before putting them into soup. My first experience with using dried mushrooms. The shipping and handling is a bit much for the weight.
5,Note to Self,"Note to self is a collection of brilliant observations and thoughts from Sam Adam's journals. Sam is the reason I enjoyed this book, because her voice is serious, her jokes are vivid, funny and she times a punch line cheekily well.Samantha Adams has problems, not only does she hate her job at the caf√©, her ex Tom who left her and had ended up marrying his tennis instructor two weeks before their own wedding; but to make matters worse, Charlie her new boyfriend also walks out on her.Lucien, the silent hero of the book, introduces Sam to his singer friend called Luke. Pretty quickly, she would not be able to bear having him out of her life. Note to Self is full of twists and turns. You cannot put it down once started."
5,Of course cats are gods!,"This novel had me at ""Everyone knows cats are gods."" Author Liz Dejesus writes with realism and depth. With an engaging voice and sharp style, NOTE TO SELF is reminiscent of some of my favorite Douglas Copeland novels. A brilliant debut!"
1,not that great,"manages to show none of the splendor of the mountains, while telling you very little about trikes and how, or why, they are flown. tip to aerial photographers everywhere: DON'T mount the camera on the wing and take pictures of the pilot."
3,chapter 2 makes the book,"Chapter 2 of this book titled ""Self-Sabotaging Life Scripts"" was the most informative for me. The various case histories were also useful in demonstrating the different types of career sabotage. The questionnaire in chapter 1 isn't very useful because I've been fired numerous times from different jobs and commited self-sabotage, yet I scored very low in my self-sabotaging tendencies. Therefore, I don't think the questionnaire asks the right kinds of questions.The unfortunate thing about books like this is that people don't read them until it is too late to make much of an impact on their career. Personally, I read this book after I've been fired numerous times and all but ruined my chances for a career comensurate with my background. I might not ever be able to have the same room for growth as I would have had if I hadn't sabotaged my career. Because of this book and my experiences however, it's unlikely that I will screw up what I have now and wind up worse."
4,Tibetan Simpson here,"This book is less entartaining than his other ones, but in fact it is not intended as a substitute, but as a complement for the other ones. We havefor instance the poetic description of skinhead bully and the clash in the pub, a typical Simpson story, multiplicity of climbing, and the complete study of Simpson's face and the consequences of using his mimics. Apart from these Simpsonites, the book itself is a treatise on Tibet, once a peaceful, free country - the Roof of the World. Read that and understand what you did not want to know. It would be fun to read this book before or after seeing ""Seven Years in Tibet""."
5,J.J. Inc. has finally gone public -- buy stock now!,"Simply put, this is a fantastic recording. With Freddie Hubbard (tp) and Clifford Jordan (ts) joining J.J. on the front line, the sound is reminiscent of Blue Note classics like ""Mosaic"" or ""Hub Cap."" It's too bad this sextet did not record other times, and in fact J.J. was quoted in an essay by Loren Schoenberg as saying this group was ""the best one I ever had."" Cedar Walton and Tootie Heath are in great form, and bass player Arthur Harper (this is the only recording I have ever heard him on) holds his own with the other five giants of jazz. Songs like ""Mohawk,"" ""Fatback"" and ""Aquarius"" achieve a powerpacked post-bop groove equal to anything in the early 60s. The Inc. will not disappoint."
5,This book is excellent but....,"This book is excellent, but my newest book, ""The Monetary Elite vs. Gold's Honest Discipline"" expresses all of the important principles even better and includes developments over the last four years to illustrate my point of view. Furthermore, the new book reflects comments I received from readers over the last four years and incorporates comments from well-known authors on this subject including numerous scholars from Mises.org (Frank Shostak, Christopher Westley, Joseph Salerno, among others), Stephen Roach, Kurt Richebacher, Doug Noland, The Mogambo Guru, Addison Wiggin, and others."
3,Well Written Book,"This is a simple well written book with over 400 puzzles. However I felt the puzzles were too simple. The tactics are rather straightforward, so if you have been playing the game for a while you should get most of the solution in under a minute. So if you are looking for brushing up ur tactical skills this is a good book. For advanced tactics this is not recommended."
4,Into the Swirling Pool,"Murakami tells a coming of age story of two brothers in Japan, only it is not your typical coming of age, because, well, this is Japan. Radioactive and perverse, this tale of two brothers is both crazy and beautiful. Murakami's description is vivid in detail, like looking into a swirling pool of colors, though the novel does not seem to have a point. It just builds upon one stunning description after another, until all of a sudden, the swirling pool of colors comes to a halt. Perhaps this is what people are always talking about when they refer to post-modern literature. Despite the fact that Coin Locker Babies seems to operate by stream of consciousness, it is an astonishing read and I could not put it down."
1,Dismal,"I join others who did not care for this book. I simply could not get through it. I though it was poorly written and often just repulsive. Finally I decided I was wasting my time trying to read it. I suspect that his surname may be what got this author translated and published in the first place. But what a contrast with the excellent writer Haruki Murakami! Go read ""Kafka on the Shore"", or ""The wind-up Bird Chronicle"", your time will be better spent!"
3,Their Hair Band Phase,"These seven tracks find perennial frontman Phil Mogg wandering in the wilderness of late 80's hair metal with the same group (minus Paul Raymond) who cranked out the Whitesnake-ish ""Misdeameanor"" album a few years after the Mogg-Way-Chapman-Parker-Raymond lineup gave up the ghost and Phil had to start again from scratch. If you hold your nose and close your eyes, you'll get past the obilgatory sexpot strut and frenzied shredding to find that this stuff ain't half bad if only because Mogg always surrounds himself with guys who know how to produce solid hooks and a satisfying crunch. Far from the best UFO, but hardly the worst. If you got some disposable dough you don't know what to do with, there are more reprehensible ways to squander it."
3,"phil mogg,lost soul","the songs are not bad , the album is not bad, but I can sence a touch of sadness in this music, as if phil became a lost soul and a soul survivor, it's like he was saying I am here to rock,but hey Michael,Pete,Andy,Paul .....Where is everybody? i'll still hold on the name ufo as long as i can."
2,I'm feelin' tragic...,"Man talk about if at first you don't succeed....After the vinyl debacle that was `Misdemeanor', Phil Mogg waited about two years or so and once again dragged UFO's name through the mud with a minor atrocity called `Ain't Misbehavin''. Even the record company must have thought this was a mistake because it was only a six-song EP that was barfed out in early '88. No Pete Way or Andy Parker; not even Paul Raymond, Paul Chapman or Neil Carter could have saved Phil from this dreck. The music on the EP is `80's hair metal at its most keyboard driven, radio friendly and totally devoid of soul, class or cajones. I hate this period of UFO, talk about dark times man. Maybe ""Easy Money"" or ""Rock and a Hard Place"" are worth your trouble but otherwise don't bother. After a misdemeanor, Mogg has committed a major felony! Jeez!"
2,three Stars is Generous,"You can forgive the early album experiments prior to Phenomenon but this and the Misdemeanor album are in my opinion poor and not identifiable as true UFO sounding albums. This is OK if you like AOR with ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" being the best track on offer. For a trademark UFO album Schenker on guitar is a bonus but you must have the song writing combo and performance crunching backbone of Phil Mogg and Pete Way. Thank goodness these two got back together to create the trademark sound again on ""High Stakes"" and the other later UFO and Mogg/Way albums which are all significantly better. Three stars is generous for these seven tracks which are a little bit but not much better than the last efforts on ""Misdemeanor"". Save these 'till last if your collecting the back catalogue."
1,Review Followup,"News Bulletin -Jelleestone's contract bought out by Warner Brothers - no further albums to be released through WEA. Steve Jordan, former Warner Canada A&R, where art thou?"
1,Would Be No Stars Whatsoever If Rating Enabled,"Rexdale's (read: Toronto) self-appointed superstar Jelleestone finally releases his major label product after a protracted 3 year wait. ""$, Part 1"" has a somewhat catchy chorus, but the track itself is ultimately a lost cause given Jelleestone's determination (lyrically) to compete with ""jiggy"" rappers south of the border. The accompanying video does nothing to dispel this contention. Although the Canadian (and Toronto) rap community has received accolades over the past 5 years or so, ""$, Part 1"" is NOT a highlight moment in the progress of that country's urban industry. Avoid at all costs (will Warner Brothers ever recoup its investment in this ""artist""?)."
2,Don't read this one first,"I am an avid Vonnegut lover, his books hit society below the belt. This book no matter profound is jumbled and confusing. If you want to pick up Vonnegut start somewhere else. Although this is his most acclaimed book I think it is the worst. Don't start reading Vonnegut here."
2,Billy Pilgrim's Life,"I thought this book was too science fiction. The planet Tralfamadore and time traveling seemed to block out any useful theme the book might have. The book changes time too frequently and in a confusing way. It is not even tied together in the end. Maybe it is just because I do not especially like science fiction. I expected Slaughterhouse-Five to have a strong anti-war theme, but it turned out to be a science fiction book."
3,I love Vonnegut but this was a tough read.,"The time jumps are dizzying. Still I always remember Vonnegut characters vividly, I love strange characters."
2,No Longer Happy with my Samsung Slimfit HDTV,"We purchased the Samsung 30"" Slimfit HDTV so we could watch the Superbowl in High Definition. For about 5 months, it had an amazing picture. The bad news started (of course) after our store return period expired. The edges of the screen became blurry (so much so that you can't read text displayed near the edges of the screen), and there are fine white horizontal lines in the screen that will not go away. Lately, the screen colors fade in and out, like the color changing nightlight in my daughters room. We found other similar complaints on the web, so at least we are not alone, but we are curious about how well, and how soon, Samsung will solve this problem. This is our first Samsung product, and the jury is still out on our intent to repurchase."
1,A huge pain! Run far away from this TV...,"Approximately 1 year after purchasing my Samsung set, it began to randomly turn itself off, then back on again. The problem progressively got worse, until one day it went completely out. I took it to my local Samsung repair shop. After 2 attempts they were able to temporarily fix it. The set worked for about 1 month, then started the old problem again. I can usually watch about 1 hour worth of TV before it starts turning its on and off. It will eventually develop an 8 sec off/on pattern which makes watching anything on it impossible. Of course my warranty had expired when the trouble started. So now I will have to haul this very heavy set back to the repair shop, where they will likely put a band-aid on the problem, because I don't think anyone really knows how to fix it."
3,misleading title,"A more accurate title for this book would be ""365 pieces of parenting advice."" There are lots of nice thoughts and ideas on parenting here, but i already have several general parenting books. Each page is numbered, and some examples of the content are: #276 Weekend Escape (about taking a weekend off with your spouse), #34 Apple and Apricot Puree (a recipe for young eaters), #335 Diaper Rash, #67 Teeth Brushing. There are many non-activity pages like this. I did find fun passtimes for my baby and me, although most were ones that i'd already come up with on my own, and I had to weed through a lot of general parenting content to find them. Colored ice cubes in the bathtub was an original idea which I will try out. This is a nice book, just don't expect to find 365 actual games and activities."
3,Not quite 365 games,"I agree with Mary. My baby is now almost 5 months old and I have just purchased this book. I don't need any advice on breastfeeding now after 5 months! There are some good games, and even a few good recipies and words to songs and rhymes we might have forgotten, but the title is indeed misleading."
2,misleading title,"I was disappointed with this book, because it doesn't deliver what the title implies. Upon reflection, the content of the book isn't bad, but it just is not a book of games, for the most part.The book is a list of snippets of advice, recipes, activities, and yes, some games. The items are organized by the age range being targeted, so presumably you can use it as a reference for ideas as your child grows.Because of this organization, the early pages are completely devoid of anything like games (because newborns are generally too young to play, I guess).The book would rate 3 stars if it was titled something like ""Random Ideas For Parents of Smart Babies"", although honestly, I would lose the whole ""Smart"" thing altogether, because most of the book has little to do with mental exercise, as far as I can tell."
2,Not for non-Christians,"The author is very biased towards her religious views, to the point of being offensive. She uses the words ""pagan"" and ""heathen"" as pejoratives. I put it down in disgust about halfway through, when she disclosed that she believes the earth is only 6,000 years old. I couldn't even trust her book recommendations when her first goal is clearly to indoctrinate her children. It's a shame because there aren't that many resources for those of us interested in Charlotte Mason's educational approach, which is not, itself, incompatible with a secular education."
3,Kelly's Heroes Soundtrack,This product was excellent for teh soundtrack. But again not the same Burning Bridges I came to expect from the movie.
3,Remarkably mild and awfully slow,"I was very surprised by this book. I expected a classic American collection of Pecos Bill Tall-Tales to have some real humor and life to it. Well, the stories are so extended and deadpan that they end up being lifeless and sort of forced. I mean, Pecos Bill is a bigger than life, hearty, funny, wild trickster and adventurer. This books reads like one of those ""You-are-there"" middle grade historical biographies.So, if for some reason you want your little reader to know the official and classic Pecos Bill, this is certainly the authoritative source. But if you want an entertainment based on Pecos Bill, this probably isn't it."
1,Don't be misguided by the Title,"I thought this book is on investing on stocks in the internet. It is not. It is mostly a theoritical book talking about ""internet stocks"". It was not even clear to me what he meant by the internet stocks. I am sorry to rate it as single star. I am returning this book because it does not serve my purpose."
4,4 for what it does,"I am thrilled with my digital pen, it has made working with my art tablet extremely easy and I find that I can get my artwork done quicker using it. Before I ordered the pen, I did read a review saying that they also liked their pen, but warned that the pen itself felt 'cheap'. That I would have to agree with, for what one pays for it, the feel of it is, disappointingly, like a dime-store quality toy. However, I can and do overlook that fact since I love the outcome of my work. The pen that came with my art tablet has a nicer feel in my hand but I don't like to use it, it is harder for me to work with. If you can overlook the cheap plastic feel of the product and focus on the things you can do with it, then this is a good investment."
2,Disappointing,I agree with other reviewers in that the pen lacks a certain substantiality. ie it feels like a toy and the control wheel has a chintzy feel to it. Also would it have killed them to include useful some documentation?
4,digital pen airbrush,it work petty good .but it do not support all the brushes and sprayers tools using essencial 4 .only painter 10 and 11. but still interesting .very spence thought.
2,Mildly Amusing,"This account of a trip around Ireland never really reaches the heights it should. Although well written the problem is that the writer simply isn't that funny. Two things to remember: 1) this has nothing to do with Shane MacGowan, and 2) I reckon any reasonable writer could turn out this standard fare."
5,Hilarious and Warm-Hearted look at Ireland and The Irish,"If you love Ireland and the Irish, know who Shane MacGowan is, don't know who Shane MacGowan is (but are curious), enjoy warm, humorous, good-hearted travelogues and don't mind if the author is as daft-as-a-brush, then this is the book for you.Tim Bradford's travels around Ireland are laugh-out-loud funny - his gift for reporting on the eccentric, the humorous and the just-plain-bizarre is wonderful. Not your typical travel guide (many of his attempts to 'do things' - such as attend plays, visit monuments are often (hilariously) thwarted), but his style and charm are guaranteed to win you over.If you would like to take an 'alternative' journey into the heart of Ireland and the Irish, via many pubs, music sessions and meetings with altogether wonderful characters - then why not pick up this terrifically enjoyable guide to the Emerald Isle; you won't be disappointed."
2,Not quite what I thought it was,"I'd hoped for an entertaining romp through all things Irish. Instead, the book delivered a few random drinking stories. They're well-written and occasionally entertaining, but the book's premise is really just a starting point for a series of meandering adventures."
3,Description,"For years Kara McFarland had done precisely as she pleased within the idyllic confines of her Bahamian retreat--including practicing karate on her kitchen chairs and tickling the ivories at 4:00 a.m. So how dare lean, mean interloper Max Ellis challenge her nocturnal pastimes? Worse, how dare he make her one of his nightly pursuits?Sexy Max boldly probed Kara's privacy, claiming to seek honesty in a world of sham. Unfortunately, he was way off base. For at all costs Kara had to protect her shady past, even if it meant forfeiting a future with Max .. . ."
5,Awesome movie!,This is a great movie. I watched it when I was a kid and now watch it with my kids. It's even entertaining to my 2 year-old. I would definitely recommend this movie.
4,A very good fun.,"I loved it. Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh."
4,"Great movie, pretty good Blu Ray quality","Beetlejuice is one of my all time favorite movies and while the Blu Ray quality is certainly better than my previous VHS copy, it's not perfectly crystal clear and neither is the sound. There is one fun part about this Blu Ray too, it includes 3 of the Beetlejuice cartoon episodes."
5,A true classic,"I am in my mid-twenties and I had never seen this movie before!! It was on the list of ""must watch"" movies and I am glad I did. Although kinda out there and at times - just plain weird, I would highly recommend anyone 12yrs + to watch this classic! Many great one liners and fantastic group movie references."
4,Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition),"This is just a fun movie to watch. Heck, the whole cast is great in this movie, and the music is great."
5,It's been so long,Since I watched this movie. It is great I recallt hough. But my movie store was to lazy and couldn't get up yo help me find it.
3,Beetlejuice DVD,"Let me start by saying that the DVD arrived in the condition indicated and at a good price. However, the shipping seemed to take a lot longer than I would've expected. Although it arrived within the ""receive by"" window, the time span they indicated was a two-week period--hardly precise info. I'm not sure why it took so long."
2,Say 5 times Beetlejuice and hope that it appears again,"I really hopes that Beetlejuice would appear again. At least on DVD. Because this is a very poor edition with no extras at all. Just the plain old transfer with no remastered sound or nothing new. The only good extra features in this disc are the spanish and french tracks that doesn't mean that there no spanish and french subtitles also. As with any Tim Burton title, I wish a special edition would come up with all the backstage and in the making footage that make us understand the dificulties of doing a complex (and simple) movie like Beetlejuice."
4,Blu-ray Movie,I think blu-ray movies are great. Although there are some of the older movies that have been done in blu-ray that haven't really come up to the blu-ray quality that the newer movies have. But I guess that's life. This one is pretty good quality.
4,.,"High-quality Tim Burton movie; energetic, funny, weird, and possibly his best. It's everything that Pee Wee's Big Adventure was, crossed with the darker aesthetic of the films that would follow (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, etc.) A whimsical and imaginative story enhanced by fun, creative special effects and good performances all around."
5,A classic!,"Beetlejuice is one of my favorite movies.It's very morbid with a lot of weird looking people in the Afterlife Waiting Room. I found out the guy's name with the shrunken head! It's Harry the Haunted Hunter.You'll want to see this, and get the soundtrack."
4,Good movie.,BeetleJuice is an old movie. but it's also a movie you don't tire of. We try to watch it a few times a year.
5,Great family movie,"Kids will love it I did when I was one, and a lot of the jokes wont make sense to kids which is good because they are adult jokes...... Fun movie that never seams to get old buy it you will love it. I almost removed one star because it wont bring me popcorn refills.........sigh.... I ll let it slide though"
2,Beetlejuice [Blu-ray],"First time I saw this movie. What can I say, probably, Burton's fans would disagree with me but I believe it is a shallow, primitive, very uneven movie. Not a keeper at all. Blu ray is ok, but not great."
3,why is the online price to BUY it higher than the Blu-Ray?,why would i buy it to own it on my Amazon cloud when it is a lower res version than the cheaper Blu-Ray disc on Amazon already... really now Amazon you need to fix that. digital media shouldnt cost MORE than a physical copy (that comes with a digital copy in most cases)
5,Movie,"This is a great movie! While it does not have the paper insert, for the price the movie is worth owning!"
1,Beetlejuice downloading,Was only able to get it on my IMac. Would not use the amazon for viewing movies. We really like the movie.
2,CASPER IS THE GHOST WITH THE MOST,"Michael Keaton brings no distinguishing characteristics to the ghoul 'Beetlejuice', he merely acts bizarre, as does the script. It is often stunning cinematography but when the movie itself comes into focus, it's like finding one of Beetlejuice's snacks in your popcorn."
2,Not very good,"Debbie Lee Wesserman claims that ""the casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable"". This is of course nonsense - the casting was an unmitigated disaster with the sole exception of Alec Baldwin who manages to salvage a second star for the film with a particularly memorable performance."
1,Not funny and especially not for young kids!!,"I did not find this movie at all entertaining. I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton but I though it might make a cute Halloween movie. Didn't do it for me. It also says the ""F"" word and that is not a word I care to listen to or allow my children to listen to in my home. It seems that things that I found fun and entertaining in my youth are no longer fun and entertaining to me. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch as a family I would not suggest this one."
1,it ist a comedy its more of a scary flim realy and grose,this movie was post to be a comedy reelt to me it was hore movi there were was onley one scene in this movie that fuuny if you are looking for a comedy that is not scary at all and does not grose you out then donet see or buy this film is to scary for a comedy adn way to grose ok but if you want towatch you dont have liten to you can do anthig you want but if you do see or buy this just rember i warned you.
1,Great Movie,I thought this movie was fabulous. It was the worst movie ever. I love to watch it. I really think it is boring. I can watch it all day and night. The aCtinG was horrgreat. It was the worst movie ever. It was the best movie ever. The effects were terrible and great just like the sound effects.
4,One of my favorites,"I enjoyed this movie when I was little and I was sure that my 11 year old would too. She likes it a lot. There are a couple of ""insinuate"" scenes where Beetlejuice creates an exotic club for himself (I completely forgot about) but overall it's a good movie with GREAT music/dance scenes"
4,say it one more time,"How can you ignore a movie with Michael Keaton as a exorcist demon ghost and Winona Ryder as a gothgirl? Great music, great fun, great effects with one criticism.....the ending sucks with all it's joy and happiness? What's with that?If you like scary, funny films with an all star cast that actually perform to their abilities, then Beetlejuice will deliver to the max!"
2,dumb,Weird and dumb. Hated Michael Keaton in this role. ugh.I would not rent this or recommend it. The End
1,"Um, this is NOT rated G!!!!!","Warning to those parents thinking of introducing a G-rated version of this movie to your kids: this is NOT the movie you're looking for!While Amazon clearly states this as G rated on the regular and HD versions of the download, it is NOT. (I am not talking about the actual DVD, I'm talking about the INSTANT VIDEO option)Much to my dismay, I found myself scrambling for the remote when a scene popped up with vulgar language! (F bomb, anyone?)Not cool. So, to warn parents hoping for the elusive ""G-rated"" version for your kids? Um, this is not it!As an adult, with appropriate ratings disclosed, it's great."
4,On Being Dead,"This is one of my most favorite movies. I'm ashamed at my self. Because it took me so long to finally get it on DVD. This is truly one of the most funniest movies about being dead.Barbara and Adam, are a young couple who die in an accident. Their house is bought by another couple whom they have nothing in common with.But when Barbara and Adam start to like the father's daughter Lydia. They start to question wither or not scaring the family off, is really what they want."
5,Still Great,"I still love this movie after all this time, funny, quirky horror movie: what more could you ask? I found Nightmare befor xmas boring, wish Burton would make more things like this. Might be too scarry for very young children with ghosts and dead people etc. but it's mostly a comedy."
5,Classic Keaton,Beetlejuice is a treat for young and old. My family can watch this movie over and over. One of my personal favorites of all time.
5,A Family Classic,Early Alec Baldwin before his head literally got bigger. Fun effects and goofy characters. Great dance number but Michael Keaton really steals the show.
5,"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!","I love this movie! It is probably one of the best movies ever made, written, acted, and filmed.Tim Burton, is literally, a genius. To create such a dark, gothic world in this film, with great dark humor, and great charactets must have been funDanny Elfman even brings more spirit to this movie as the composer. Some of his most famous composed songs are in here (The Beetlejuice theme).Winona Ryder does a terrific job as the sad, gothic daughter Lydia, who has to move with her parents to the country. Her parents don't understand her, no one does, until she sees ghosts in the house. THe previous owners, by the way, want these people OUT! So they find a bio-excorcist named Beetlejuice to help them.10 out of 10! A perfect movie!"
2,"Good movie, HORRIBLE DVD","I love this movie and I bought it on VHS a long time ago. Recently I bought the regular PG version on DVD at my mom's store. The first thing i noteced was that the disc was double sided! about halfway thru I had to flip the disc over to watch the rest of the movie. and another thing: It was censored. I don't mean just the ""violence"" i mean language. Then I bought the PG-13 version hoping for a better verson. Instead I found out it was the same thing, just with a different cover. So i reccomend you buy the VHS.Trust me, it sucks."
5,Fun for the Whole Family,"This is one of those classic fun-filled movies. It ""aged"" well and kept a room full of 10 and 11 year olds happy."
5,AMERICA'S CRITIC,ITS BEETLEJUICE!!!! PLAIN AND SIMPLE OWN IT IF YOU DONT I HOPE THE BEETLEJUICE SNAKE WILL GET YOU...
4,Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice!,"Beetlejuice is so funny! I love this classic comedy, and it is so adventerous! Buy this movie today & if you like comedy/horror films, get this!"
4,Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beatlejuice!,"Winona Ryder is HOT! HOT! HOT! as the gothic death-rock princess of Doom (see ""Lucas"" for more W.R. action) The best performance from that eldest Baldwin brother that I've ever seen from any of them.His zenith I'm sure. BEST PERFORMANCE - goes to - Miss Ryder!,of course, I'm a BIG fan, you see? FAV PART - when Beetlejuice was chumming up to Baldwin's character while wearing the same type clothes. No big deal, just witty and clever charm with spit. and when Beetlejuice hits up on Gina Davis and/or Winona Ryder"
5,"A bizzare, hilarious and unique movie!!","First time I saw this movie...I loved it. Have watched it several times now to catch things I missed the first time. Alec Baldwin and Gena Davis are superb in their acting. Winona Rider also stars and does a wonderful job in her role. This flick is a family one. The 'F' word is said once, though."
5,BeelteGeuse!,"Day-O, I sing it with the movie! ""That is why I won't do two shows a night, I won't!"" Beetlejuice! You will laugh, little kids could be frightened but other than that, buy it write now if you want big laughs, big scares, and big fun!"
5,"BEETLEJUICE, BEETLEJUICE, BEETLEJUICE","One of my all time favourite movies, even as a kid I loved it, it's a classic horror/comedy that is very entertaining. I heard rumours of a sequel. The cartoon was a major dissapointment but then I suppose it's aimed at kids. I used to have a few of the figures as well, hang on, I still have."
5,GREAT,"THIS IS ONE MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE IN YOUR MOVIE COLLECTION. IT IS FILLED WITH COMEDY, ACTION, AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT TO CALL IT."
5,A Classic Commedy Piece,An excellent commedy movie. It's alway good to have a piece of good commedy in your movie collection.
4,One of Tim Burtins best films!!!!,"I have loved ""Beetlejuice"" when it first came out! Tim Burtin is a guinis if you ask me. If there was any stars above 5, I'd give him that many. It starts out where this couple go to the store and they crash into the side of a bridge and fall in the water and dround to death.They die but there spirts still remain in the house. Then Beetlejuice tries to help them get ride of the people who have move into there house.There is only one girl who can see them and she tries to help them too.Everybody in my family loves it and I recomend it to anybody who want's to evan think about buying it."
4,"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Bee-","Beetlejuice is in my opinion a classic film with not enough Michael Keaton. Although he is the titular character, this story is more about the characters Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and their struggles in dealing with the afterlife. After their early death in the movie, they have to stay in their house for a certain amount of time before they can 'move on' but things go horribly wrong when a modern, city couple and their moody daughter move in.Without spoiling too much, I'll let you know that Beetlejuice still holds up very well today. The story is fun, the effects are a little cheesy but not horrible, and the comedy is almost nonstop. I gave it 4 stars due to the lightning of the film being poor in some areas. I kept hoping someone would bust out a flashlight during the dinner scenes. Overall, you are certain to enjoy this movie, especially if you're trying to see it as part of a Halloween marathon as I did!"
3,Blu Ray Not as advertised,I decided to buy this DVD after looking over the product pictures that other users posted and reading that this version of the movie has 3 of the Beetlejuice cartoons on it.This DVD does NOT come with a bonus CD sampler as shown in the pictures. It also doesn't come with a slip cover as shown in the pictures either. The movie itself is very good with a nice clear picture and great sound. I have the original VHS but wanted this as well for the reason stated above.If you plan on purchasing this item be aware the version you get might not be the one listed in the picture.
3,"Great Audio Quality, Not-So Great Video Quality","Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I inserted the Blu-Ray disc in my player, and turned on my TV and modern surround sound receiver. The movie started playing, without the menu displaying, and in Dolby Digital 5.1. I had to pull up the menu to change it to Dobly TrueHD 5.1, which turned out to be excellent (lot's of surround sound).The movie was about an hour and a half long. The aspect ratio was 1.85:1, so it filled my widescreen LCD. I prefer 2.35:1.If you are a fan of this movie, and are picky about Blu-Ray video quality, you will be disappointed. There is fine grain in a lot of scenes. Somtimes the movie looks good; sometimes not very good. It was very colorful, in fact, there was too much color in a lot of scenes. The lowest I've rated a Blu-Ray was 4.0 on a 10.0 scale. This movie varied from 6.0 to 8.5."
1,WARNING: CLAMSHELL EDITION IS EDITED TV VERSION,"I, myself always enjoyed this movie, it's very funny and entertaining, so I didn't hesitate to pick up the clamshell edition. I guess it was a marketing plan to make the movie more for families or something, but they have eliminated all strong profanity and elements that are usually edited in the television version. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. If you want the uncut version, AVOID THE CLAMSHELL EDITION!"
4,Movie well done,This is a good and entertaining move with good acting and great music.If you like a good escape from everyday life that's clean fun this movie is one to see!
5,Next big thing,"So, I'm in Borders with my four-year old, listening to the CDs that they put on the rack. In the last section I browsed, listed under ""pop"" was this CD by Convoy. I listened to it. The first tune was great. I figured one tune could be good, I'll check the next. It was better. And so on, until I had listened to most of the CD while my daughter pulled CDs and books of the shelves.I bought the CD and listened to it TWICE that day in the car as we did Christams errands.It's a great album. I can't really compare it to anything, but it is pretty much a straight ahead, melodic rock album with a bit of a country tinge. Very smart lyrics. I haven't been this excited about a CD since Pete Yorn came out. Buy it."
5,Convoy-Black Licorice,"Absolutely Awesome!!! Essence of pure Rock n' Roll! Great vocal harmonies, incredible guitars, thumpin' bass. Highly Recommended."
1,For Children's Ears Only (but children deserve better),"Simson's settings of Milne's Pooh poems are delightful. Unfortunately, Cindy Jenkins' amateurish performance leaves much to be desired. If you can find a recording of tenor Robert Tear's performance of these songs I recommend purchasing it instead."
4,A WELL BALANCED ALBUM,"A friend of mine who is now 69 yr old was part of the Will Bronson Singers who are on this CD. But that notwithstanding, I think this is a great album..a good balance between commercial and timeless sounds. IF I RULED THE WORLD is gigantic....NOONE including Robert Goulet or Sinatra sings it like this."
5,Sliding Pads,The pads arrived as promised and do what I expect them to do (provide protection). The are also a very comfortable fit.
5,Great product and great price,I am a vegan and have arthritis - so I am vitamin D deficient and need calcium since I don't do dairy. If you need calcium - you should take magnesium and D with it - to make it effective. I take a lot of supplements so price does matter. The Solaray - Cal-Mag Citrate + D has everything I want and is the best price on the web.
5,Andromeda Excellent,With so many Star Trek shows out there it is nice to get away from the idea. Roddenberry has a grand view of the future with Andromeda. While the show may start off a little slow it makes up for it during it's 5 year run. This is a box set to be had by anyone that is a fan of Gene Roddenberry or Kevin Sorbo.
5,For the die hard Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda fan..,"..what are you doing? Buy it already. Totally worth every penny. It's much smaller than it appears due to it's double-sided slim dvd packaging. No more double-sided dvd discs, all are one sided (much better).The only flaw is that it does not have a description of what each episode is about..still giving this price 5*'s.Every episode plus bonus features..my favorites are the bloopers!"
2,Very average series -- disappointing features,"This is a very average SF series. For most of the episodes I found myself checking the time to see how much time was left. Most of the story line is not at all compelling, though there are some episodes that are quite good. The acting leaves a lot to be desired; however, Lexa Doig is well worth watching. That cannot be said for most of the special effects, which appear to be vintage 1970 and used repetitively. As for the DVD set itself, I like the compact package. I really liked the price; I got my set for $80.00. The deleted scenes are okay and the ""tours"" with the cast are very interesting. The bloopers are lame; surely there were more and funnier mess ups. One big NEGATIVE is the lack of close captioning. Overall, I am not unhappy that I bought the set, but I will not put Andromeda in my ""will watch again"" pile as I did with Firefly and B5. In fact, I will most likely put it on ebay."
5,"Love the show, can't buy this collection. :(","It's really disappointing to realize this set is no longer available. I really want to buy it, but I can't find it anywhere. The ""New"" ones that are currently available through the Marketplace vendors are not the same packaging as shown here and I cannot even verify they are legitimate. Please give us a way to buy this set."
4,Swashbuckling Adventure throught the universe.,"This is the complete 5 series of andromeda ascendant. A sciencefiction universe in it self. Introducing 6 distinct characters you will come to love. Though it is claimed that the story is based upon a GEne Roddenberry's Creation, nothing of the Star Trek consistentent socialocigal Framework is detected. And the story as a whole will remind you more of a Crimson Pirate kind of adventure than any thing else, this due to the main male characters Dylan Hunt (ex-Hercules, Kevin Sorbo) Tyr Anasazi( Keith Hamilton Cobb). As such stories revolve more about the interaction between the characters posed with solving a problem, than elaborate different civilisations which need to be inspected. None the less it is good fun, like a fun bedtime story.Get this set and have your own endless reruns when you want them."
2,mostly for a younger audience,"the content was good, but i didn't really like the format of this book; it seemed geared toward middle school students rather than adults. the short chapters, the ""storytelling"" tone, and the jokey drawings were distracting to me. w/ that said, i did enjoy the content (although it never went into much depth) and have a new appreciation for the sex life of bugs."
5,Packed with intriguing (and often surprising) information,"Fans of insects and those who would learn more about their sex lives will find James Wangberg's Six-Legged Sex to be packed with intriguing (and often surprising) information about insect sex. From sex hang-outs and influences on mating habits and strategies to insect peculiarities per species, Six-Legged Sex is highly recommended for school and community library collections."
1,Not much here,This isn't a text for older readers and it isn't a topic for younger readers. I did not enjoy the book and put it down early. There are many other entomology books that do better.
1,snuggle fabric softener,I received this product and it was leaking everywhere so didn't get the full use of it or money worth. very dissappointed
5,Phenomenal and more,"If you are even a remote Dylanhead, this set is a must. An extraordinary, profound, breathtaking set of music, never released before. Simply adds to the Dylan legend... The booklet and some of the pictures are pretty cool too... (I just ruined Volume 1 of this set and am looking to replace it without buying a whole new set. If anyone can help...)"
4,I Love Bobbie D.,"the album contains his songs & re-makes of songs & some new songs. i'm going for the entire bootleg series collection. so naturally i had to buy this album. truthfully the live stuff is where it's at, but this is very cool too. i'm glad i have it."
5,Bob Dylan bootleg series,"Love the Cd has songs I had never heard Bob sing, and everything was just fine."
3,Flashes of genius?,"I have to say I'm ambivelent about Dylan. I have a book of lyrics and periodically I take it down and try to make sense of what seems profound, though in truth it's largely impenetrable to a non-intellectual such as me. But Dylan's 'Last Thoughts on Woodie Guthrie' is such an amazing piece of writing that I have to bow down. Dylan riffs his way relentlessly through sentiments that strike such aching chords within that it's impossible to deny his eloquence. That he wrote this when he was twenty years old is almost hard to believe, but I guess that's what genius is all about."
3,BD bootleg series 1-3,"This is an absolutely incredible collection that anyone who even remotely likes Bob Dylan should own. I purchased it brand new and it came in wrapping, but it consistently skips on one song at the same place. I noticed slight gouges in the CD."
1,Coulda Been Better,"purchased this CD based on the strength of his latest Bootleg Series #7&8 thinking it would be as good and was very disappointed. The fore mentioned was the best music I've purchased in years. This CD had much potential but just got aggravating after a while. Don't buy it, get 7&8 instead."
1,"The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased, 1961-1991","This one....""The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live, 1966: The ""Royal Albert Hall Concert"", was so bad I didn't even bother to open this one.....just returned it along with the other one."
3,This is a review of Disc One only,"I have tried liking this. I do not hate it, but it's kind of ho-hum. Maybe discs two and three are the best since sliced bread, but you can see why most of this wasn't released. IMHO, if you want primo Dylan, get Time Out of Mind, The Biograph Box Set, Volumes 1 & 2 of Greatest Hits, Desire, Nashville Skyline, or Highway 61. These are all way better. The songs don't sound bad, but they just aren't too memorable."
5,Americon Icon,"I'm just a casual listener and Dylan fan. I really liked this set, easy listening, sounds good, I think all would enjoy."
4,"The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased, 1961-1991","The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased, 1961-1991 being a compilation box of Dylans unreleased songs from 1961 to 1991. Some of the songs that standout on this compilation are ""He Was a Friend of Mine"", ""Like a Rolling Stone"", and ""Angelina"". Dylan was and is such a prolific songwriter and the quality of his lyrics are impeccable. To imagine that I just started listening to Dylan some years ago then I realize what I have been missing for so many years. This is nothing short of genius! 4/5."
5,Fascinating venture into altered consciousness,This is a very interesting description of an apparently simple but effective practice of using body positions from art work around the world. I found the use of the postures to be helpful in evaluating both my inner world and everyday life experiences. I highly recommend the book to all that are interested in stretching the understanding of their relationship to the world we live in.
1,What's the deal?,What's the deal here - I've ordered product numerous times. Now the price has gone up and the quantity has been cut in half. Is this an error or a rip-off?
4,Madhava Raw Agave Nectar,Pros: Good price. Good product.Cons: Bottles very hard to open. I prefer the darker Agave.
3,Not the perfect sweetner,I found that I have to use more than regular sugar in my coffee to have the same sweetness. By the time it is sweet enough there is an after taste that I do not care for. Bought a whole case that I may regret. Have not yet tried in baking or other use. I do not know if it is the brand as this is my first try of agave sweetner. Probably will not buy again..
3,"""Raw"" Agave Nector","The Madhava ""Raw"" Agave Nector arrived packaged as promised and very quickly thanks to Amazon super savor shipping. I was very excited to try this since I'm a raw fooder and also read that Agave Nector has a low GI value and would not affect my blood sugar.It was very disappointing for me to learn that manufacturers can label a product RAW even when it's not. After learning that most Agave nector is usually mixed with cheap corn syrup (also low GI) during processing to extend the product and is heated to above 150 degrees. This is neither a raw product nor a healthy product even if the GI is low.I will do more research before trusting ""RAW"" labels in the future."
3,Agave for Diabetes,THe product has lowered my blood sugars by 50-75 mg every day. I'm pleased that there is no aftertaste.
4,Good stuff - packaging needs some work,"The agave nectar is wonderful stuff! The only complaint I have about this product has nothing to do with the agave at all. When I've purchased this the bottles have come in a little sticky, as apparently some or most of the bottles manage to leak out a little during shipment.Otherwise this is fantastic stuff! I use it in everything and don't have the sugar blues any more."
2,Agave Review,"While I'm usually trying to find ways to maintain tight control over diabetic issues and still enjoy a bit of ""The Sweet Life"", I must say that the ad copy for this Agave item was actually sweeter than the product itself. Now what shall I do with the rest of this case? Oh well, live and learn. Oh wait--I just figured out a way to use up the rest of my case and be a hero in the same breath. I'll give it to my sister, a few bottles at a time! That way, she'll have the pleasure of many small gifts of her favorite pure, organic sweetener and I'll remain the generous elder sister that she already knows I am."
3,Woah. When Did the price double?,"Good product, a little goes a long way in my tea. Healthier than sugar, cheaper than honey... well it used to be. I passed out a few bottles to friends who are also tea lovers, and came back here to re-order.I ordered this in September 2007 and it was a 12 pack for almost 10$ less than the 6 pack is now in December. What gives?"
3,Needs better shipping control,This is not a bad product but the shipping dept has a long way to go in the quality control section. Ordered 12 bottles but only 11 arrived full and the last was empty. Box was dripping. Don't think I'll order from here again. Maybe try local.
3,Get the book instead -- too many typos,"I'm a big fan of Noel's work. This book is no exception. That said, when you are creating a new process you must make sure there are no typos. Parts of the extension process have been pasted in, there are letters instead of planets, they are in different colors and fonts, and there are repeats where pasting in has occurred. It's a mess. If you are learning, you shouldn't have to guess if that ""t"" is supposed to be a Saturn glyph.In addition, the charts mentioned are often a page before or after which requires electronic page flipping.Please fix the extension typos. In the meantime, I'm returning the Kindle version and am buying the book."
3,Good book but not practical enough,"I was looking for something more specific,exact and this book is good forastrologers may be but not too helpful for readers.For example,the word ""communications"" is given as a key word to almost any vocation possible,leaving you with no practical example how to relate ""communicatins"" with your other trends."
4,Great Album for 2001,"all the songs were hot I like the nice bass in it just so I can bump in my ride. The lyrics were good also My favorite song is Please don't mind The verses kept it intresting through out. The album art is almost 3 dimensional So That's one star. 2 more stars for Intresting Lyrics and One more store for the bass in it So get this before amazon Has to restock it again. Favorite Line in it ""lets skip away for a few after that I'm Crushing you""-DJ"
3,Phillys Most Average,"i really wasn't expecting much from this album but it was suprisingly decent...... it has some good songs on it esp. ""cross the border"" which kills in clubs and house parties.... some other good songs are ""suckas part 2"" and ""please dont mind"".... overall the cd has some tight beats(done by neptunes) but the flows are extremely weak and there voices are even weaker.... so the weak flows and nice beats kinda cancel each other out which makes for an all right cd that's good for some head bobbin....... check this cd out if you have some extra money........"
4,I like these boys- 4.6,"This is a tight album to roll to. The flows are typical Philly styles with Mr sounding like Mase but the album is indeed tight. Mr Man and Boobonic spit on ""Please Don't Mind"",""Suckas"",""Cross the Border,""The Game"". All the beats are tight from the start to finish, neptunes all over this, Just Blaze.The album is actually tight all the way through with appearances by Beanie Sigel on ""Suckas II"",Fabulous on ""Cross the Border RMX"". Go out and get this. One of the best albums coming out of Philly this year, along with Bilal and Musiq. You got to love this Cd, the beats and Boobonic's flow. Grab this album. Peace. One."
5,Nice One,Philly's Most Wanted did a great job on their new album. they came much better than their last album. This one is bangin from the beginning to the end.
3,"Misnamed, poor quality, yet 3-year-old's favorite","Instead of fast trains, this should be called ""Random Train footage we had lying around."" It doesn't follow the format of the other ""All About __________"" videos. It seems as if the production company just slapped their brand onto something someone else made years ago. It doesn't seem to have any fast trains, or educational value. It does have poor-quality footage of trains, model trains, and a man riding a tiny train around a parking lot while a bunch of people stand by. I suspect that I am a better cinematographer than was used on this film.So the quality of the production would warrant 1.5 stars, but my three-year-old would want to give it five stars. He loves it. He begs to watch it. He plays with his trains while he watches it. I do like that it's appropriately paced for a toddler. It's slower paced with few cuts, so it's not overwhelming. If you are looking for a video to captivate a toddler while you shower or make dinner, you could do worse."
4,Great fun for a young train lover!,I have a three year old son who absolutely loves this movie. We had a copy before and he wore it out. It's great fun for him.
3,Rename this DVD!,"The DVD should be called ""Something about Trains & Planes"". There are hardly any fast trains in this DVD. This product seems to have been filmed in the early eighties & the only fast train they show is the Amtrak Acela express. The audio is also extremely poor. Extended footage of model trains, a parade in some town, and Santa distributing candies to kids from the back of a train!Despite all this my son who is 3 loves it! He would give it 10 stars!"
2,Title is misleading,"While the video/DVD does focus on trains, they do not show any real FAST TRAINS for more than a couple of minutes. In fact, the movie shows more of a parade on a model train set than it does any fast trains. Once again, someone trying to make money off of a title, while showing very little knowledge about trains or railroads. You get what you pay for!"
5,FLAWLESS FUN,"What a great show! And it really holds up. It's been forever since I've seen it and I love it more now that I own the DVD. It doesn't seem like it should work. Why do I put up with (and thoroughly enjoy) all of the over-the-top gags, acting, and dialogue? It's all a giant-sized cartoon wink ;-), and it's alot of fun. When I first saw it I didn't even understand that it was an old-style ""screwball comedy"", as explianed in the bonus materials, but I loved it just the same."
4,"Great Movie, Great Director's Commentary","Peter B does a great Commentary on this film that is filled with facinating stories and interesting insite into the behind the scenes films.Oh yeah, the movie is still great."
4,"""That's a person called Eunice?""","I first saw this film as child, have screened it many times since and recently watched it again to satisfy a craving for slapstick. ""What's up Doc?"" is a terrific homage to the kind of movies that were made thirty years before its time.I don't want to make little of the contribution of the director, writer, or two leads in this film, but after my most recent screening, I had to stop and give thanks for the comic genius of the late Madeleine Kahn. This was Kahn's debut and her portrayal of Eunice Burns is perfect...that is, perfectly hilarious. The wig, the walk, the wavering voice, and the many other subtleties written into this character (including her choice of bedtime reading) complete the persona and I could not help but to think of the talent and perfect timing of Charlie Chaplin when trying to write about Kahn's body of work. She will be sadly missed."
5,Fantastic!,"This movie was an Easter attraction at Radio City Music Hall back in the days when that was something special. And speaking of something special, so is this film.From the crackling opening title song (Barbra's rendition of ""You're The Top"" is one of the best things she has ever recorded) throughout every second of this homage to the old screw ball comedies, you can't help but laughing and loving every wacky second of this delightful movie.One historical note of interest: when the movie first played, audiences did not hear Ryan O'Neals response to Barbra's statement: ""Love means never having to say you're sorry"". That's how loud the audience howls of laughter were when she uttered that line.Well, with the video, you'll hear (and love) every second of this movie."
4,A great family film for parents tired of kiddie fare,"At last, a grownup movie I can watch with my three-year-old son! I first saw this with my family when it aired on TV in the 70s, and loved it. Years later I watched it again and was happy to see I still enjoyed it. But best of all, it appeals to my child too. I rented it so he could see the fabulous and hysterical car chase scene at the end, but he actually paid attention to the whole thing -- a first! He was riveted by all the intrigue too, and found the suitcase switching scenario quite fascinating. Of course, the chase scene is a classic, something all ages can get a kick out of. (I love the exchange, ""What's happening? I can't see!"" ""There's not much to see, actually, we're inside a Chinese dragon."") If you're tired of watching the kiddie films over and over, try this one and give yourself a treat as well as the little one."
4,Fun Family Film,"It's too bad Hollywood does not make screwball comedies like this one anymore--enjoyable for kids, ""tweens"", and parents without containing scenes/language that make parents squirm. Our kids loved it and we enjoyed it too. Madeleine Kahn gives a hilarious performance as ""Eunice"". Has lots of familiar faces from the 70's."
5,Such a funny movie,"This movie has always been a favorite of mine--in my opinion, one of the few truly great modern-day comedies. A definite family movie. Glad is it finally out in Blu-ray."
4,Entertaining and Funny,"It was a a good funny movie to watch. It is a little corny and dated, but we really enjoyed watching it."
5,Zany caper flick,I love this movie. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys quirky caper/mistaken identity type situations. A great light comedic mystery.
4,Classic Barbra,Love Barbra Streisand in this movie. I am partial to the joint venture of Streisand and O'neil. I have had great laughs with this movie and I can never forget it. A trully funny movie of the 60's era with a great support cast.
2,Not charmed,"There is clearly a market for this type of screwball comedy it just doesn't do anything for me. Nothing is supposed to be believable and I frankly thought that O'Neal was horrible. I do like that they address that ridicuous line from Love Story though. I'm usually a Barbra Streisand fan, but I feel this was totally beneath her. I'm sure this type of comedy appeals to other and really you're just going to have a take a chance and see if this tickles your fancy. I still love Barbra."
2,How was this film ever successfull?,"I saw this film because it has great reviews everywhere one looks. However, with exception of only a few funny moments, the film was a terrible bore. It starts as something that could work out as a comedy, but as the ""story"" progresses, it becomes worse and worse. Whether it should be respected due to its tip of the hat to older screwball comedies or not, makes no difference because it lacks some of the most essential ingredients of a decent story. Characters are largely unmotivated for what they do; there are too many unbelievable plot devices which make it impossible to hold one's suspension of disbelief. Compared to real screwball comedies, such as ""It's a mad mad mad mad world"" this film falls flat on its face.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the film did have two or three moments when I chuckled."
2,Slow and Slower,"I ordered 2 movie DVDs on 7/27/05. One arrived quickly. This one is still on hold after 1 month. Amazon says I may get it next month, maybe later. If you are in a hurry for classic movie comedies, you may be better off with another vendor."
4,What's Up Doc?,"I like this movie and agree that Madalyn Kahn makes it. I usually like the commentaries that the stars make as you watch the movie, but in this one Streisand seems like she never even heard of the movie, much less acted in it. They should have asked one of the other actors to do the commentary who enjoyed making the film."
4,What's up doc,"This is an 'old school' comedy and is funny considering it doesn't have any cussing or gross humor that is what movies are today. A string of ever increasing misadventure for Howard Banister (Ryan O'Neal) caused by Barbra Streisand, supported by a great cast and locations, this is a great movie for the family. I actually don't like Barbra Streisand that much, but this is one movie I like her in."
1,Catalog?,"...from the manufacturer of Frigidaire, Tappan, Gibson and White-Westinghouse brand major home appliance.There are no illustrations of parts or appliance accessories in this 'catalog', there are no part specifications listed nor other specific product detail. It appears to be just a manufacturer's retail price list.On the good side there are a considerable amount of part substitutions listed. In this day and age, however, most of the people that might be interested in those would likely get more benefit if they were available in electronic format, maybe on an accompanying CD-ROM?Webmasterwww.Appliance411.com"
4,Beautiful Creatures ... I raise my fist,This will be a brief review since I have only had two listens to this nice addition to my collection. Being a big fan of Joe Leste's last band ... Bang Tango ... I was looking forward to this release. Joe's voice is better than ever and a breath of fresh air to the cookie cutter front men that roam the air waves. Guitar solos ... I can't tell you how much I missed them. Good and plenty on this disc. Nice mix of hard edged bravado and slow tempo blues flavored ear candy. Thank you Beautiful Creatures for sticking to your roots and embracing the new. Do not have a favorite track ... but I will admit that 1 A.M. brought a big smile to my face.
1,What a joke,"How many of the below reviews were written by members of the band??? Give me a break. This album would have been huge in 1989, right along side some Steelheart record. These guys are all OLDER than they say and there music sounds there age. After listening to this i wanted to grow back my Mullet and pull on my old Jean Jacket with my all the Rock Patches. Hee Haw! Buy this if you are a big fan of 80's hair rock, stay away if you were born after 1979."
2,Another 80's band,"I can't believe there's still an 80's dinosaur band still roaming the club circuit, much less signed to Warner Brothers! The melodies... the chord changes... EVERYTHING is soooo predictable This music was worn out 15 years ago - unless MAYBE you're a teen who has never heard ""Beau Nasty"", ""Danger Danger"", ""Skid Row"", ""Slaughter"", etc. I really wish this band would do something more adventurous... like along the lines of ""POD"", ""Pissing Razors"", or ""Rob Zombie"". Joe Leste definitely has the wicked, raspy voice to be doing something really good. It's just a shame he's stuck in this 80's rut. Disco made it's comeback. I don't know if 80's metal will..."
5,Rock and roll is finally complete,"Beautiful Creatures is one of the most talented bands to come out of this millenium. It's good, old fashioned, in-your-face rock and roll. There is something for everyone to enjoy to the max on this cd, from blow-out-your-speakers rock to hauntingly evocative ballads that would make your heart skip a beat for these wonderful guys. And what amazing guys these are as well! As everyone knows, personality rules over looks (which aren't to bad either ;) and these guys could win anyone over. They have the hearts of gold and make every single one of their fans feel special just for being themselves. Beautiful Creatures have what it takes to rule rock n' roll; just watch them take over!"
3,Had trouble getting into this one.,"Generally, I love what Doig has written, but I had trouble getting into this book. I hung in and completed it; and by the end, I was sorry to finish it. I guess I'm saying I prefer his fiction."
3,"Read this book, but get a different version","This is a lousy edition of a pretty good book. The Bantam Classic version is full of obvious typos and has no notes to gloss the numerous French passages. If you read French, you might not mind it so much, but the typos will still be there."
4,A Great Psychological Drama,"This is a book for readers who love a good psychological drama. There is a plot, but the novel is driven more by the main character's internal struggle between independence and love, her loneliness and her fears, both real and imagined. Lucy Snowe is a fascinating narrator - at times unreilable and quite possibly unstable. The role of women in society and the catholic church are the subject of serious criticism. It's not quite as easy or pleasurable a read as Jane Eyre, but has a depth and impact on the reader that make it a hugely satisfying read. It's gripping, but not melodromatic. It leaves lasting questions and there is an ambiguity in its resolution which led me to question the relationship between reader and author.One caveat about this edition - it's not annotated so there are no translations for the french dialog which pops up occasionaly. I used google translate, but it would have been nice to have the translations."
5,A wonderful old story of triumph.,"A lovely book. If as a writer, I could get one person to shed one tear and be moved by my storytelling, then I have succeeded. I found this story moving and delightful. The writing was breathtaking, the sentences poetry. Loved it. Downloaded for free from Gutenberg Project. Amazon also offers it for free. It is a classic that should be read at least once in a lifetime. For me, a few times will do. Excellent book."
5,Better than Jane Eyre!,"The swift movements of the characters and their emotional speeds were overwhelming. This book is the perfect example of creative sentence patterns that draws you in as a reader until the last page of the book. Not as cry prone or tissue wrenching as Charolotte's Jane Eyre, but more intense and tragic.I'm not sure on why the title is thus called Villette, a piece of land without much inhabitants. But with the narrator/main character Lucy Snowe, she is constantly lonely and depressed, which may explain her initial connections with the grounds of Villette."
4,French translations not included,This is a very good story with compelling characters. However it is difficult to get the full effect of the story if you aren't familiar with French and your edition doesn't have translations provided in the footnotes.
2,barnes and noble edition,this review pertains only to the barnes and noble edition.buy another edition. the introduction is horrendously bad. the notes are skimpy. the comments are scattered. the writing is exremely poor (this is accentuated by the fact it introduces a work by an author whose prose is magnificent).NOTE: the barnes and noble edition of 'jane eyre' is pretty good.
1,Idiotic Kindle Store,"Thank you for sending me, as my ""free Kindle sample,"" the introduction, table of contents, and chronology for this book. Yes, this is exactly what I needed to help me decide whether or not I wanted to purchase this book: not a single actual word from the novel itself. Brilliant!"
3,"Disappointing, verbose story of a repressed woman","If Bronte had cut at least 200 pages then we'd have had a fascinating study of the interior of a nineteenth century woman's life in Belgium with insights into the consequences of sexual repression and religious dominance.As it was there were pages of sermonising about catholicism and Christian belief and a tortuously slow realisation of her feelings for other men. The writer presumed the reader had an excellent grasp of French, which is unfair from an English novellist.I found the eulogies on the charcters thought to be good tedious and discomforting and the harsh view of others outside her close acquaintance cruel and harsh. It was a real struggle to complete the book and the ending with its deliberate almost chiildlike ambiguity infuriating."
4,I'll muddle through the middle to get to the end!!!,"I read this book directly after reading ""Jane Eyre"" because I was so compelled to read more of the brillent Charlotte Bronte's work.In the beginning I had high hopes of the book written by my favorite author. In the middle I was asking myself why I was reading this. Now I've finished (just yesterday), and I've been inspired to read another one of her books.Although I did feel like I suffered a bit through some of the verbose chapters, the story as a whole is the ""equal and likeness"" of ""Jane Eyre,"" and I will value it as one of my favorite books of all time. ""Jane Eyre"" will remain supreme though.Now I'm onto ""The Professor,"" and after that will come ""Shirly."" Sad will the day be when I run out of all the Bronte's works!"
2,couldn't get into it,"I usually enjoy this genre, and everything the Bronte sisters wrote, but I got about a third of the way into this one and just couldn't engage with any of the characters...."
4,Villette,"Villette, though not as well known as Jane Eyre, is till one of the great Bront classics. I read it ages ago but have just obtained it simply to store on Kindle so my memory of it is not so fresh. Hence the brief report."
5,As wonderful as Jane Eyre!,"I am shocked and pleased to find that this novel is as enjoyable as Jane Eyre. I would definitely recommend the Oxford edition to anyone who wants to learn more about the time and does not speak very good french. I love french, but I don't understand it perfectly. The notes in the back make everything clear!"
1,Very disappointing,"I love Jane Eyre, and am more than happy to accept its Victorian coincidences. But in Villette the coincidences are too many and too preposterous. But what's worse than that is that the author doesn't play fair with the reader. Halfway through the book we find out that our heroine has been conscious of one of the coincidences for a couple hundred pages, without letting on to the reader. I almost quit right there -- and I should have. Villette is simply not one tenth as good as Jane Eyre, and it's a pity."
2,Full of stereotypes,"Both this book and ""Jane Eyre"" seem to say that women have to be plain and destitute to be considered virtuous, honest and worthy of love. Men, on the other hand, must be capricious, unpredictable and often offensive to be really attractive. Then, of course, under the heroines' care these men improve greatly and become quite ordinary or at least less irate and offensive. It is further explained that these wonderful men are not innately lacking consideration to others, but only as a result of a twenty year-old unhappy love experience. Both ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Villette"" have their charm and can be enjoyed, especially if read in early teens, both books have wonderful supporting characters (Madame Beck, for example), but the books come across as romantic and frustrated teenager fantasies rather than a realistic description of relationships between men and women."
3,I don't agree that this is better than Jane Eyre,"It could be me, but this was not the page turner that Jane Eyre was. People seemed to feel it was better so they may know something I don't. I think it was passable, and even though Lucy Snowe is moral and upright one still cares about her. The teacher with whom she falls in love is not as likeable, at least to me. It is Jane Eyre like in the fact a moral and woman with her head on straight falls for a mercurial pain in the butt. The free kindle edition was a perfectly good copy."
4,Slow burning,"This is a journey into the solitude of the mind of a woman in the Bronte era, to me tragic in the smallness of her life and overwhelming sad about how confined women's lives were made by themselves and the men in 'charge' of them in this period. Her attention to detail in the describing the spirit and emotions of Lucy's internal life are at once fascinating as well a recognisable to anyone who has sat down to reflect upon the life around them in a quiet moment. Her characters spring out of the pages and, even tho' I cringed at the smallness of the lives, I became fascinated in the details as one might with a dew drop on a petal."
3,A trip back,This was a book I missed when I was young and reading Wuthering Heights. It was interesting to read about attitudes of some english people back in the 1850s.
4,Gotta Get A Gund! Get it at Amazon!,My son purchased this bear for his girlfriend. She wanted a white bear that was around 18 inches and this fit the bill! It was soft and furry. Nice quality
3,white bear,"I like the bear ok, but I wish it were softer. It's pretty, but not as cuddly as most other Gund bear."
1,i have not received it,I have not received it and I was wondering if you could find out what happened to my order please.
1,Wince,A title and abstract that were clever and convincing enough for me to spend the money to rent it. Content is just mind numbing enough to make me get up from the movie and hit the net just to write this review.
4,"Great family movie, great acting except for ...","This is a really well done movie, lush visuals, a variety of interesting and eccentric characters, and good comedic dialog and pace. Everybody knows a sister Wingate with her ""I'm better than anyone else and let me tell you about it"" attitude.The story's female lead sticks out from this eccentric and well portrayed crowd as a single dimensional character, her love life. She broke up with Howard and ends up in the small town to recover. Inevitably she succumbs to the romancing of main character Tartan. But her acting is a flat and lifeless as a placid lake, there is no life there, no spirit, and she is not so good looking that she can overcome these flaws. The non-speaking character played by Diane Rane, the imported branch president's wife, shows more character in her less-than-a-minute on the screen than Beers does in the whole show.See the movie, it is a great example of LDS film and should be considered outside that genre as well."
3,Kinda funny,"This was a little silly, but pretty good. I'd watch it again, mostly because I know it's clean and I could watch it with my kids in the room."
4,The varity of DVDs on Amazon amazes me,"Before Christmas I needed to lay in a stock of family DVDs. To be honest, I do not recall ordering this particular one -- BUT we were so glad we had after we watched it. As an LDS family we like to be able to let the family (especially the grandchildren) be able to chose and watch their picks without too much supervision. We all liked this. We are very happy with this addition to our library."
3,Corny Acting. Don't Waste Your Money,"I watched this because the box said it was nominated for some awards. BY WHOM??? Ok, there were a few times I laughed, but for the most part, it was so stupid and corny and lacked any professional acting abilities that I had to ask myself, ""Do I really want to sit here any longer?"". But I did, out of curiosity. It was a waste of money and time. Spare yourself the drudgery!Gail Gupton, author ""Seekers of Truth"" and ""The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment""."
2,Not Magnificent At All!,Academy award winner George Kennedy sleepwalks thru this one! Very lackluster performances from the whole cast! The only reason I gave it two stars is for fairly good cinematography. Save your time and money! Skip this one!
2,A lesson in quit while you're ahead,I love Westerns because I love the scenery and the music but Guns of the Magnificent Seven is really pushing my tolerance level. The acting is bad. Good actors. Nothing wrong with George Kennedy or James Whitmore. But the lines they were given and the direction was bad. Hang the writers and director. Go ahead and hang the producer too. The photography is good. Rent this movie but don't buy it.
3,Nice and Black,"My job requires I buy all black tennis shoes. They are very hard to find. I did see these and ordered first an 8 1/2 which is my size and they were too small. Next, I exchanged for a 9 and had absolutely no hassle with that exchange. The 9s fit fine. They are a bit flimsy and I can feel stones under my feet when I walk on gravel roads. But, for just a shoe to wear at work, they are fine. A little bit pricey I would say.... BE SURE TO ORDER AT LEASE A HALF SIZE LARGER THAN YOU USUALLY WEAR."
3,Good But Disappointing,"How can I say anything against Tony Bennett - I love him! But the choice of songs in this CD is sort of a mixed bag. I would not call this his All Time Greatest Hits because it left some out like When Joanna Loved Me and some others I can't remember right now. I would say half the songs are terrific and half are the older ones that I never liked anyway such as Because of You, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Sing You Sinners. There is a terrible rendition of the song Maybe This Time from the movie Cabaret. A different and faster arrangement might have saved it because it is a good song, but it drags like a dead whale. The theme from Love Story I have never liked, so you might want to factor my taste in when considering this review. I would recommend buying this USED. The hits are on here....it's just a matter of personal taste as to whether you like the choices."
5,"""A Time for Love"" my favorite","My favorite all-time Tony Bennett recording is the song ""A Time for Love"", which is included on this album of hits. Composed by Johnny Mandel, ""A Time for Love"" is not only a beautiful love song, it is one of Bennett's great performances.His phrasing is Sinatra-perfect. I mean Frank in his glorious prime, as we have here with Tony. Sinatra never recorded this song, but I doubt he could have done it as well as Tony. It was a song composed in Heaven for Bennett."
4,very good collection,i have always dug and respected Tony Bennett and as a kid my grandparents on both sides played his music and i dug his tone and phrasing. i felt he had a cool deleivery and take on the songs and the arrangements. he was cool with his. he knew when to bring drama and rise to the occasion and then he knew when to hold back and ease up. I Left my heart in San Francisco is my favorite song of his. dug his take of Stevie Wonder's for Once in my Life. he is a cool stylist and this is a very good collection.
5,Best Portable Light Ever!,"Last winter our power was out for nearly a week. My Petzel Zipka was the only light I needed to use! It leaves my hands free so I can read, cook, dig through the cellar, etc. Its downward angle means I can hold my head normally yet still see where I'm going. It's the best reading light I've ever used. It's lightweight and the retractable cord fits my (giant) head comfortably. The batteries last a long time and the LED's are bright.I bought 2 more after this experience--I never want to risk being without one!"
4,My dog FLIPS for these treats!,"Ever since my daughter gave me these treats for my dog I've been hunting for more bags to no avail. We are down to our last two chiplets and Maggie Moo really wants more, so, I tried the website, but the website was lame and didn't show the Mint chiplets for sale. So I tried Amazon and of course, they had them at a pretty reasonable price. It's nice to know that I don't have to run around to lots of different store to purchase these again. By the way, not only does my dog literally ""flip"" for these snacks, they are all natural, freshens her doggy breath, and has only 6 ingredients: beef liver, whole wheat flour, wheat bran, charcoal?, peppermint oil and water. Im not sure what the charcoal is for...?"
2,defective dvd,"Marsalis On Muisc; Wynton Marsalis;Tackling the Monster, the fourth dvd in the set, is scratched and doesn't play all the way through. This is the first dvd that I have purchased that was not in great shape."
3,Not Exactly What I Ordered,"The pen works great, but the one I recieved is NOT the pen pictured! (I'm not unhappy with it - if it didn't work, I would have returned it.)"
5,The pen just rocks,Wish it wasn't so expensive and hard to find but I guess you gotta pay for great product. My other pen took a dump and purchased this one. It has been working like a champ ever since.
4,Does the Job,"I thought I ordered the Grip Tablet pen, but the Classic one came instead. But that doesn't matter because this is a legitimate Wacom pen, and it works perfectly with my Intuos3 tablet. (:"
4,grip,It is a good pen but it still needs more grip. It needs little cuts all down the grippy part because my fingers still slide down and hit the button on the side sometimes. Overall though its still a great pen.
1,Incomplete discription,"Perhaps the Intuos3 Grip Pen is the best pen ever for the other Walcom tablet. Unless you have an Intuos3 tablet you may not know that this pen is for the Intuos3 tablet and not just the name of the pen. The box was clearly marked Grip Pen for the Intuos3 tablet. Why couldn't they clearly show that in the write up? If they did, I don't remember seeing it. For those who have the Intuos3 table I must say the feel is very comfortable."
4,2 year old vs Tablet Pen,"Until my 2 year old met my pen and cup of coffee, this was a great pen. Now, not so much. Who knew coffee and 2 year olds could wreak so much havok on a *sob* 76 dollar piece of equipment that I need for work today! Bleh!"
2,I think it works but my wife can't get it to do anything,My wife can't get it to work but I think it is okay. Maybe she'll figure it out eventually.
3,Wacom Intuos3 pen,"The newer Intuos3 pens are much lighter than the older Intuos2, the multifunction button is also much sturdier and the lower profile eraser is a much better design. I can't live without my tablet and the pens have come a long way. It's also good to get an extra if you are a power user."
1,"Why did I not read the other reviews, not correct pen pictured!","I always read reviews before I buy anything, but I made my first and last consumer mistake online. Since my job was ordering it for me, I didn't think of anything to find the link, and send it to get ordered for me. To my surprise, I got the ""classic pen"", not the grip pen pictured. For the love of God, change the picture. How can I even rate this product properly if it is not the one that I ordered. The pen works fine, but feels cheap in comparison to the one I previously used."
1,Didnt get the right pen,"I ordered the intous3 pen as pictured and i recieved the Classic pen, which is a cheaper and less comfortable pen then the one I wanted. I have tried to reutrn but got no response from the seller."
4,"Good, Very Good!","Super Hits, a colletion of the best of Eddie Money with classics like Take Me Home Tonight (my favorite) and Two Tickets to Paradise, big successes of the eighties that will for ever mark the history of the music! A great cd!"
5,Ska Gods and proving it!,"OK, linked here from broadcast.com, listening to DLTBGYD right now (at work), I've had this album since it was released and just wanted to drop a few words here saying that all toasters music is great. If you don't have this album, get it, kid! I also recommend the earlier pietasters stuff, plus anything by the bosstones. E-Me for more........"
1,Recital songs,"I understand Charlie Byrd is a great jazz guitarist, but you'd certainly never know it from his Christmas albums. The song selections are OK run of the mill holiday fare, but there is nothing to set these tracks apart. The chord melody style is so banal as to be droning, the chord choices are too simplistic, and the technique is quite heavy-handed and overly loud. To put it bluntly, they all sound like a 6th grader playing at a recital. I accidentally put this disc on my iPod and during a shuttle play, one of the tracks came on, and the effect was quite jarring.If you want some good-sounding Christmas guitar, try David Cullen, Tuck Andress, Joe Pass or Alex di Grassi."
5,Nearly 15 years later and I still come back to it..,I bought the first published edition in 1990 and I've never been able to forget this story. Wonderfully sensual storytelling makes it easy to get lost in what the characters are feeling and how their relationship grows.
3,An interesting mystery,"(Note: I received a free Kindle copy of this book in exchange for my review.)In Cold Truth, attorney Lou Mason is caught in a tangle of deceit and multiple suspects as he attempts to defend a troubled girl accused of double murder.I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight as Goldman introduced them at a rapid-fire pace, resulting in many character sketches but few fully realized personalities. The mystery itself was interesting enough, and I didn't suspect the ending.Overall, I didn't much care about any of the characters, and a romance kindled between Lou and another character seemed abrupt and not very believable - more of a plot device than a real interest between the characters."
5,Lou Mason.,Another good read in the Lou Mason series! I've really enjoyed getting to know the characters Joel Goldman has developed and reading about their next adventures!
4,Gripping thriller that keeps you guessing till the end,"A well thought out solid thriller that had me gripped till the end. The writing was good the dialogues were realistic, although Lou Mason seemed to have a large amount of friends that are built like brick walls and the body count was extremly high at the end of it all.The only thing I thought did the story a little injustice was the Mason meets Abby instant love storyline. That was cheesy and not on par with the rest of the book, as if had to be fitted in there like a missing four cornered jigsaw piece being sqeezed into a three cornered hole. Aside from that I thought it was a great read and look forward to reading more by this writer. I received a free copy of this book for my review."
4,Cold truth,Plot always keeps you guessing til late in the game? Woul recommend it. Book is a great read? I read even though i am watching tv at the time
3,"Hard-boiled, fast paced and some things worked","This genre of law/crime novels has a strong male lead, confronted with a case that initially seems a little weird, then cut-and-dry, and then a little weird again.The author sets us up with the action, then cuts to a lot of characters being introduced who may or may have anything to do with the action. Along the way, our hero falls in love, at first sight, and I felt this part of the story didn't really work. The inevitable conflict broke them apart, and then they tried again, and won, but the storyline just didn't ring true, especially against the backdrop. Lou's character I could understand, but it seemed like this woman was missing something, both in character development and moral development.The story itself was fairly good, with no real new elements introduced, but still a nice rainy day read.I received a complimentary copy of this book for review."
1,Undeveloped Characters,"I quit reading after about 20 pages. Goldman slaps the reader with about 30 characters' names in just those 20 pages! Names of people a reader is supposed to believe in; however, none of the characters are ever developed. I'll return to GOOD mysteries and murders."
2,Not recommended,"This entry in the series is much weaker than the first two. The elements that made the first two work -- Lou's relationships with his friends and family, the sense of place and his approach to solving the crime -- are almost completely missing. Even though it is quite obvious who the killer is by half way through the book, the hero has to muddle along forever until he stumbles on the answer which made it a real chore to finish the book. The plot relies on one coincidence after another which is always a sure sign that the author is out of ideas or just lazy."
4,Solid read,"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.I found this book a solid read, if not a little too slow at times.The story line was good but just couldn't grab me enough to read it non stop.Would I read another of this authors books? Yes most definitely."
2,Lost interest,"Read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this novel, but I lost interest after reachng 19%. I think the reviews overstate the positive and the low price. In fact, the plot is not compelling and the characters are not interesting."
5,"Good learning material, full with details","I am an artist who love to make detailed art work in my drawing and sculpture. I love art, but it cannot become my life career. While unable to attend any art class but despreately want to learn I look in to books for answers. And I found this book. I find my answers to the detail I'm looking for in this book. The book shows you how the artist create a female body sculpture starting from bone to muscle, and from muscle to skin. This book is a good resource to me. As my own Christmas presents I bought it."
3,Great service disappointing book,"The seller was excellent. The book was cheap, in great condition, and arrived fast. The book however was a little dissappointing. It did not explain or go into detail about the different parts of the body, nor did it explain HOW to sculpt the different pieces very well."
4,Amazing book - but not exactly what I thought...,"If this book was actually what I had been looking for, I would have given it 5 stars. However, it wasn't exactly what I had thought. It is not so much a ""how-to"" book as it is an illustrated diary of the artist's amazing process. This particular sculptor sculpts the entire skeleton, muscular system out to the finished sculpture you see on the front of the book. It's amazing but a little more detailed than I believe a beginner such as myself needs - I was a little daunted by the entire process but also quite in awe. The photographs are tremendous. This book would probably be better suited to students in advanced sculpture."
4,Pretty darn good,"This book is more helpful than Lucchesi's other guides. There is a lot of practicle info here which will help you get familiar with figure sculpting. I would say that this book as actually about as helpful as taking a beginning figure sculpture class, and the techniques are very solid. I am actually a pretty tough critic, and a 4 star review for an art instruction book coming from me is pretty rare (check out my other reviews for art books if you don't believe me)."
1,"Better titled ""Anatomy for Artists""","I was looking for a book with better instruction on the technique of figure modeling. Ended up returning this. This is just a walk through of human anatomy demonstrated in clay with very little information provided. Even as an anatomy book it's poor. First make a skeleton from clay, then apply muscles, then skin/subcutaneous tissue and voila! a perfect figure. This is really the extent of instruction provided here. The sculptor seems to be trying to demonstrate that essential characteristics of the finished form should be established from the very beginning of work - so it's noteworthy that in the book he's working on a clearly MALE skeleton and ending up with a female form at the end."
1,yuck,"I was buying these as a party favor for a shower. The box they came in was lovely, but when I tasted one cookie all I could think of was yuck! I couldn't even finish one. They have an aftertaste. I would not reccommend them."
1,Madeleine,Too sweet and does not taste any other Madeleine I used to buy.I won;t buy again from Biscoff Gourmet.
3,Read Between the Presumptuous Lines,"While Mr. Starkey has certainly done his homework with the richness of dates and events, he has an exceedingly irritating habit of asking rhetorical questions that add nothing to his historical presentation. He is also given to hyperbole and flagrant supposition that is not supported by his dates or events. This book may be an entertaining read for someone who is curious about Henry VIII and the general political and religious temperament of his court, but the reader should beware of conclusions that are seemingly drawn from the writer's own desire to present a dramatic picture that may not be supported by actual facts and accounts. To truly understand Henry and his wives, the reader should read other accounts of the King as well, and draw his or her own conclusions, rather than having them force-fed by an assumptive author."
1,Isn't this book about the wives?,"As a lover of Tudor history (especially of the six wives) I found this book both poorly written and dull!Maybe some people are interested in Tudor politics, but the book jacket reads that the book is about the SIX WIVES OF HENRY! All this books talks about is politics! I understand that many people effected the queens' lives (like Crownwell and Wosley)but the book seems more about them then the queens themselves."
5,Don't Believe Megan,"Friends, this is an excellent book. If you were to watch his DVD series on Elizabeth and other Tudor monarchs, you would clearly see that David Starkey is an excellent scholar, has an outstanding grasp of the Tudor monarchs, is quite articulate, and can take the highly complex issues and explain them in a very understandable way. This book is no exception. It is very intelligently written, is helpful, and not just a rehash of other scholars.I find Megan's reveiw of this book so far from reality and utterly foolish as to be offensive. Her suggestion that one could learn as much from a story book is utterly absurd. Undoubtedly, her review must be the result not only of pure bias but also of pure inebriation."
1,Never delivered,Take it off the website if it not in stock!Waited til after the holiday's to get notified that it was sold out.Would have been nice to know while I was placing my order.Very lame service.
5,A real intense thriller from a different angle,"I like the way the book takes you thru the process of how someone could becomes a serial killer. The details were right on. The author kept me on the edge of my seat with the twists, turns and mazes this killer takes you on to hide himself from society until he is ready for you. After reading this book, I now understand how a serial killer could be my next door neigbor or the person I live with."
4,A Chilling First Novel,This was really chilling. Dr. Turner is so close to the mind of the serial killer that her story reads like a first person account. I could not help but keep reading despite my very negative feelings toward the killer. Don't read this one alone at home. I'm eager for her next book.
5,This is an EXCELLENT book!,"This was the best book I've read in along time. It was creepy from beginning to end, but it's so good you just can't put it down. I stayed up until all hours of the night trying to finish it. I definately recommend this book."
2,Too many pointless details,"I thought this was going to be descriptive in the sense of how a serial killer thinks. Instead, the author goes into senseless details about how fluffy the character's towels were and how the characters loved their dog, etc. I felt like I was reading a cheesy Danielle Steele novel. There needs to be more gruesome details on how the serial killer enacted his crimes, etc."
5,the best palmestry book for ages 6 to 13,This book is so cool i loved it i bought it at a book sale and im glad i did i found out a lot of stuff about myself and fiqured out what the lines and my fingerprints mean .. this book is the so good you should buy one to NO KIDDING !!!!=]
2,Disappointed,"I was initially excited by this book when I first bought it, but it became more & more difficult to follow as I went thru it.The reason is the book's poor usage of events, places and maps. For example: the book talks about what the Etruscans did, but doesn't tell you where they are from or even who they are. The movement of people from the Po Valley is discussed, but you're not told where the Po Valley is. Don't check the index, Po Valley isn't there. There's a map on page 14 on the expansion of Italy, but the territories referenced aren't in the text or the index. I finally gave up trying to place events with places and abandoned the book at page 23.This is a history of Italy for people who already know the history of italy."
1,Not a pleasant read,"I used this book a few years ago while teaching a course on the history of Italian literature, and can't recommend it: the prose is wretchedly awkward, and it makes for an extremely un-compelling read. The undergrads weren't wild about it either."
3,History of a famous country.,"When one thinks of Italy, one thinks of Rome and Mussolini. The author dispels these notions and shows us the true Italy. This is the birthplace of civilization and Empire. It was also the scene of the Black Death, city states, and the battleground of Europe. The author stages the story of Italy in nine easy to read chapters. One can get a short summary of the stages in Italy's development. This would be a nice read for those about to visit the country.The one thing I fault this book for is that it tends to jump around. It mentions a name, and then latter on talks about this person. Other than that, there is a nice little summary of the history of this great nation."
3,Can you do better?,"Although not the best of Miles' stuff, it's still gold. The introspective winsomeness of his intonation is audible poetry. This is not considered one of his masterpieces, but it still sounds like one. He was a geniue, and EVERYTHING he touched turned to gold. Even this sounds better than 90% of everything else I hear. Which leads me to the question: Can you do better?"
3,Ella,Too many songs after her stroke (s). Very difficult to listen too. I loved her and saw her many times. Very sad CD.
3,Good collection-Absurdly High Price,"Like the previous editions, this is an excellent collection on the racial politics of major American cities. I teach a course on Urban Politics and would gladly assign it as one of the readings for my students if the price were at all reasonable. Give people the option of buying it at a normal paperback price without the ""Value pack""."
3,Engaging Entertainment,"I am neither a Leo fan or Tom Hanks fan, though both are good actors. Steven Spielberg (already an adjective like Fellini) as director of this non-action adventure movie, it had to be worth a look. It wasn't a waste of time. The true story of a con man Frank Abagnale, Jr. adapted for the silver screen plays like a cat and mouse game involving the audience, anticipating the many ways DiCaprio as Abagnale eludes Hanks as an FBI agent on his trail. Though it seems odd that most of the jobs Abagnale, Jr. takes or (impersonates) as a lawyer, doctor and airline pilot is without effort and without those companies doing even a background check, the main story is about Abagnale, Jr.'s evading the officers. The audience is riveted to see what happens next and if Abagnale, Jr. will ever be caught. Its opening sequence is memorable but I was wondering if the real Frank Abagnale, Jr. was really on that game show. Anyway, the movie is fine entertainment."
5,This is a great movie,"I wanted to see it again and again. Not everyone will feel the same way I feel about this movie, I understand, but if you've ever had the desire to be above the law, so to speak, be sure to watch this."
3,it's a fun ride!,"Never really gets heavy, you skip along with young Abagnale. Film goes for the laughs and the humor, not letting us wallow in the pity too much. You have to wonder how much reality is here, compared to the real truth, and in the end, it is tied up in a neat bow, in the obligatory feel good Spielberg fashion. We even get a little note at the end about Abagnale's life to day.Still, I will add it to my collection-and I generally avoid Spielberg, like the plague!"
3,Can't decide what it wants to be.,"All the hype surrounding this film was that of a light, fun cat-and-mouse style adventure-comedy, and i wasn't disappointed in the first part of the movie, where there were many sly visual jokes and laugh-out-loud scenes.However, the second part of the movie turned very heavy handed and sad. I wouldn't normally have a problem with this type of transition, except here the comedy part of the movie wasn't comedic enough to satisfy my desire for a comedic film; in effect the first part of the movie had no point.Then, in the serious part, there wasn't enough drama to make me care for the characters; there was only one major conflict: Tom Hanks trying to catch Leonardo.Also, the acting, for the most part, was not so great. Christopher Walken was a let-down; for the most part I think he's fantastic but his performance was bland and boring.Overall: B-"
2,FLAT,"This movie is flat - there is nothing to it...boring and barely entertaining. Also, I find I am liking leonardo less and less w each movie. The characters, the story-line, and the production are all lifeless, and, if I didn't know better, I would think this film made by a rank amature without a chance in the movie business. Hanks tries to do his best, but even he cannot enoble this dog of a film. I can't help but wonder how many people TRULY like it, and aren't just along-for-the-ride because of the big names involved. After all, Spielberg, and certainly Hanks, just CAN'T make less than a ""great"" film, can they? The answer is ""yes"" - and this is it!"
2,Excellent plot let down by longevity,"Catch Me If You Can, which is based loosely on a true story proves to be a film with a well constructed plot and also shows a decent cast of characters. The story is simple- After his parent's divorce, DiCaprio decides to leave the household and set up on his own. With no money, he soon resorts to scams, most notably using counterfeit cheques. This story is a game of cat and mouse between Hanks and DiCaprio. DiCaprio poses as many different faces including policemen and pilots. However, the tension that builds up in where Hanks is getting closer to DiCaprio soon fades.What we are left with in the end is a film which proves to be long and, in the end, begins to get tedious. Had Catch Me If You Can been shorter, perhaps it could have proved more enjoyable. Though it may have an excellent plot and a good supporting cast, sadly, these criteria are not enough to make the film appealing to the average viewer."
2,Slow and Boring,"High schooler Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) idolizes his father, who's in trouble with the IRS. When his parents separate, he runs away to Manhattan with $25 in his checking account, and he vows to regain dad's losses and get his parents back together. Just a few years later, the FBI tracks him down in France; he's extradited, tried, and jailed for passing more than $2,000,000 in bad checks. Along the way, he's posed as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, and an attorney. And, from nearly the beginning of this life of crime, he's been pursued by a dour FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). What starts as cat and mouse becomes something akin to father and son.This was such an awful movie. It really could have been good, but the story was so slow. The acting by Tom Hanks was surprisingly bad."
4,Very Fun and Enjoyable!,"I just bought this movie yesterday and saw it for the first time last night. It started off a bit slow, but once the scams began so did the fun. Most people including me thought it was going to be a light-hearted comedy/drama due to the previews, but it really is more of a serious drama with some very sad moments. Don't get me wrong, the movie is a lot of fun and the 2 hour and 15 minute running time flys by. Leonardo Dicaprio finally finds a role that helps him to shine as an upcoming actor, and Tom Hanks is great as always as the serious cop who is on his trail. Another thing worth noting is that the costumes and soundtrack are stunning, and they time warp you back to the mid-60's. If you want an enjoyable movie with a touch of serious drama thrown into the mix, rent or buy this movie now!"
4,Di Caprio/Spielberg Is Winning Combo,"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002), starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a jaunty crowd pleaser. It's based on the true story of con man Frank Abegnale who, as a teen ager, passed himself off as a lawyer, a doctor, and an airline pilot. Di Caprio fits the role well, and the setting of the 1960's is wonderfully captured in the film's letter-perfect art direction and period songs on the soundtrack. Walken was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Frank's father. And don't miss the terrific opening credit sequence, which will remind you of Saul Bass' memorable title sequences from so many 1950's and 1960's movies."
3,Wait for the DVD to come out,"I guess I expected much more from this film considering it was SPEILBERG after all. In short, the movie takes quite some time getting started i.e., the background on Frank Jr.'s family took up to an hour to establish. The second half was more enjoyable, however, the movie was WAY TOO LONG! At least 30 minutes could have been cut easily! The scene with Jennifer Garner was a total waste of time and an insult to her talent. That's all I have to say about that."
4,Definitely worth your time.,"My mother was always convinced that Leo was a terible actor. Then I showed her this film, and she thinks otherwise."
3,Love remains,This is one of the best Christopher Walkin movies ever. Tom Hanks and Leo DiCrapio are alright in this so-so film. The script is weak and the movies too long. Martin Sheen keeps it real.
1,Why bother?,"A boring story, make that VERY boring combined with the McActor himself: Tom Hanks makes this mess unwatchable. Spielberg pumping up this broken-down film with his bag of tricks only makes things worse."
1,"Boring, nothing memorable","A totally over-acted and over-directed film, and the plot is very predictable. Save the money and give it to charity, to make the world a better place."
1,No go Joe!,"Run Run as fast as you can, oh there's an Idiotic man! So Tom Hanks is not that great of an actor any more and is getting pretty annoying and this movie prooves that! Leonardo Dicaprio's role was ok but it was a little stupid and the story to this movie remains a mystery and I hope it runs. That is all, good-bye."
5,DiCaprio's finest performance ever,"I hated Leonardo DiCaprio until I saw this. I thought he was a sissy (Man in the Iron Mask, Titanic, Romeo and Juliet). He really surprised me with this one though. I am very surprised that he didn't even get an oscar nomination. Tom Hanks did a fine job too. Everybody can expect that! The best role of the whole film though went to Christopher Walken, playing as DiCaprio's Father who became a total loser. Chris Walken was amazing. It truly was his best role since his oscar-winning performance in ""The Deer Hunter"" in 1978. Stephen Spielberg is an impressive director who always comes through. ""Catch Me if you Can"" is among the finest con artist movies I've seen. I can't wait until May 6th to buy the dvd. This isn't something that really young kids should see, nor would they enjoy it. Its PG-13 rating reflects some sexual situations and language. Don't miss ""Catch Me if you Can"""
5,Catch Me if You Can,"I really liked this film. Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of recreating the ""60's"" right up to the hair-sprayed hair, Samsonite luggage and the scenes around the airport terminal.Everything Tom Hanks does turns to gold and I don't think this is any exception. Although not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, he does a very good job in this film."
3,WorldCom's predecessor,"Yes, there are hilarious lines in the movie, the 1960s-type film credits are wonderfully reminiscent of Pink Panther, production is almost flawless, and Tom Hanks delivers as usual.But to release this movie in the year when so many people have been bilked of their money by the con-artists at Enron, WorldCom, etc.? And to glamorize this life? Real people really lose through corporate fraud! Even though Frank ""turned around"" at the end, that point is trivialized by the written statements at the end of the film. The movie should have ended when Frank is put in solitary confinement.Spielberg should have brought his social commentary skills to this subject also."
5,Catch Me If You Can,I liked the movie it was interesting to see the book portrayed in film. I actually like leo in his role in this movie he may actually be taken on film roles I will like him in. If you like the movie you may want to read the book it was much better and goes into alot of detail. If you do read it you will soon see that the movie took alot of liberities.
4,clever,"This film is very interesting to watch. As a teen-ager, it is hard to imagine all of this happening at such a young age. The movie is suspensful, and overall very intriguing."
5,"Best part is, it's a true story!!!!","This movie was awesome! One of those where you can't get up to get a snack or answer the phone! It takes different turns and twists and it's all real! The ending was the BEST!!! I'm not going to tell but it's such an incredible life and he's still alive and well!!! You do land up cheering for this guy too. Definately turns into a feel good movie and again, best part is, it's based on a true story!!! A MUST SEE!!!"
2,lack of DVD extras disappointing,"I really enjoyed the movie. I also really enjoyed the book. Hearing that there was a 2 disc DVD made me excited to think about the commentary, deleted scenes, and background. WRONG. Disc 2 is interesting and well done, but lacking tons of background on Abagnale. It alluded that they changed things to fit the screen play, but very little info about what really went down to what was made up. No expert info about his capers and if his biography was authentic. Supposedly his description of escaping out of an airplane toilet was said to be impossible by mechanics, but no discussion on the disc of that. No commentary, no deleted scenes. Unfortunately this was way too shallow for a 2 disc DVD."
2,Spielberg's Most Boring Effort,"Where has Spielberg gone with Catch Me if You Can: NOWHERE! Although entertaining with escapes, and with stunning performances from all, this movie leaves the viewer wanting more, and wishing that what went on during the film, was more extravagant, not to mention more intriguing. A rather dull film with nothing to run home about, Catch Me If You Can, however is the perfect film for when you dont have anything better to do. The only great things about this movie are Walken and Hanks. Good to see Walken back in a normal, rather happy role, eh? DiCaprio is great, however boring and stiff, and the way Spielberg works around this film is very disappointing and un-interesting at times. For true Spielberg, see Minority Report: one of his best."
4,Spilberg at his movie magic best,"Catch Me If You Can is the film of Dicarpo's 2002 Christmas double feature that I didn't see in the theater. Even though I liked Gangs Of New York more, Leo gives another great as Frank W. Abagnale Jr a teenage con men who is full of heart. Tom Hanks as arch enemy Carl Hanratty also gives a heart felt performance. The film is full of comedy and drama and is for the young and the young at heart."
4,"A fun, great paced film","I am not a Tom Hanks fan but I adore Leonardo Dicaprio. He is a wonderful actor and brilliant in everything he does. And this is one of my most favorite roles of his. Its perfect and entertaining. I couldn't believe it was actually based on a factual event. Its amazing to even think about while watching this film. The movie is actually a bit long, however, I barely felt it because there really is no down time or boring parts. It is a great chase like movie. Really captivating."
3,Entertaining...but entirely too long,"This movie is very entertaining and well put together. I am a great fan of both Dicaprio and Hanks and I think this movie did both of them good. However, there are some scenes in the final cut that I think should have been included in the ""deleted scenes"" portion of the DVD because it seems like the Energizer bunny...it keeps going and going! Great movie and very clever but make sure you have all the time in the world to watch it."
3,Passable but slow-moving tale of a charming con-man,"This is an OK movie, but nowhere near the sizzler some folks have made it out to be. It moves VERY slowly for the first hour or so, and failed to make me care very much about either of the two protagonists. Hanks is good in a basically undemanding role. DiCaprio is -- well, DiCaprio, charming and boyish -- and the script is oddly uncaring about the victims of Frank's Pranks. Worth renting if you are interested in con men, or a fan of Hanks or DiCaprio."
2,Boring!,This movie is just boring. I watched it for the first time with another couple over for dinner. We were all falling asleep and just trying to make it through to the end. BORING! The script is shallow and the acting is subpar. This is a 'renter' not a 'buyer' movie.
3,Gentle non-threatening entertainment. 3 1/2 stars.,"A fun movie, enjoyable, with one curse, no violence, and no nudity. Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a solid endearing performance, Tom Hanks is workable and believable as the agent sent to track down DiCaprio as he scampers around the globe cutting phoney checks. Christopher Walken as DiCaprio's father is fun to watch, as always.The film is beautiful, has an excellent cool jazz score by John Barry. My favorite part of the flick was the opening credits. I found the film likable, but somehow detached. It's certainly a fun movie to watch but there's not much to it, really."
4,A Delightful Hilarious Movie,When me and my friend went to view the film we were interested about how Leonardo Dicaprio performance would be since he went through such a quiet time period where he ceased to act. He was sweet in it and often hilarious. His performance was quiet colourful and provided a great contrast to Tom Hanks who played a more dull layed back character. Leonardo pulled off the role of a teenager very well and i think did the true con justice. I thought i was amazing how smart he was trust me i was taking notes on how to forge a letter to be excused from school to how to cash in cheques that were not even paid to him. It also shows the world that not all us teens aren't intellectual. Of course we should have known that anything filmed by Steven would not let us down. The only thing was it is a little long but then again i could have a short attention span!
3,WorldCom's predecessor,"Some lines and scenes are hilarious, production is almost flawless, Tom Hanks delivers as usual, and the wonderful 60s style credits are reminiscent of the Pink Panther.But to release this film in the year that millions of people were bilked by the con-artists at WorldCom and Enron? People who didn't have a second chance at life because they're ""too old""? Even the brief blurb of redemption at the end is trivialized in the way it's portrayed - Spielberg definitely didn't think this topic needed any of his skills at social commentary. The film should have ended with scene of solitary confinement, and not romanticized corporate fraud that ""doesn't hurt anyone""."
3,Sensationalized,"Ok, I know it is a movie, but really, do you have to drop all the real facts? Catch Me If You Can is based on the true life story of Frank Abagnale. It does describe certain parts of Frank Abagnale's journey as a medical resident, CEO, lawyer, and airplane co-pilot, but I guess they thought that they needed another story line so they created the FBI character that chases him. Well, in truth, he was not caught by the FBI (he was caught by police overseas) and the relationship and engagement that takes up a significant portion of the move never actually got that far in real life. Even with the baseless story leaps, the movie is well acted and very colorful.The DVD is packed with extras, even a track of the DVD entitled Frank Abagnale: Between Reality and Fiction."
4,Quite good.,"Smart, brilliant and scheming, this movie tells a story of a person wanting to be catched to show the world that he is capable of doing anything he desires and loves the thrills of being chased by fedral governments. For anyone who has not watched this, buy the DVD and add it to your collections because this one is a definite keeper."
4,Caught it and Loved It,Steven Spielberg has shown once again why he's the best director in hollywood.Catch Me If You Can tells the story of a conman named Frank Abagnale Jr.(DiCaprio) Frank fakes being a pilot and starts writing fraud checks and all before the age of 18.He is pursued by a federal agent Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks). Hanks figures out that he's doing it and the chase is on.You see Frank impersonate so many different people in the movie. Leo plays perfectly. I liked him a lot in this and it's his best performance since Titanic.Tom Hanks is awesome. What else would you expect from him. The only problem is that they don't develop his character as much as I'd like.Overall it's a great movie. I own it and I love it. It shows an interesting story and I'd recommend it to anybody.
4,I really liked this film,"This movie is based on a true story about a natural born con-man. The story becomes downright comical. For parents who desire to know beforehand what objectionable languange there may be, there is one ""F-bomb"" and some very brief adult content. The producer really could have left all objectionable non-family material out of this movie and it would still stand on it own credits--at least a 4-star movie."
3,Just OK,"Well, it wasn't bad, it had a nice ending but perhaps I was just glad when it was over. I think, after all the hoopla, I was disappointed. I can't say I'm a fan of either Hanks or DiCaprio and perhaps that's important and the reason I gave 3 instead of 2 stars. More than anything it was the story I didn't like. It just didn't come off, for me anyway. Sorry but it was just OK."
3,"Hey, not bad","I used to dislike Leonardo DiCaprio. His status in Hollywood appeared to be based mainly on Titanic, which I had never seen, but I knew it was a big chick flick for a lot of girls. This movie was excellently done. Maybe he's not so bad after all."
3,"Enjoyable,but don't expect too much","In short.This movie is an enjoyable film.It's not quite as entertaining as I though it would be, but the fact that it's enjoyable enough help make the movie, considering that it's quite shallow, and doesn't really go indepth.This movie really is more about surface glimmer,than actual depth.Leonardo DiCaprio was ok, as was Tom Hanks.Christopher Walken, in my opinion gave the best performance as the father of the ""real fake"" Frank Abagnale jr. I'm not a fan of Steven Spielberg's work in general. And this film was very surface,and seemed to realy rush itself to get to the ending."
4,Wonderful fun...,"Steven Spielberg has finally returned to comedy... sort of. Based on a true story (and from what I hear, quite accurate), this film follows the life of a very young Frank Abagnale jr. who runs away from home and disguises himself as a pilot, then a doctor, then a lawyer, all in the course of two years. The FBI is following him, particularly Carl Handratty, who works in the fraud department and doesn't have much for a sense of humor. This film strays from the usual ""based on a true story"" inspirational dreck and instead creates a fun, fast pace. The film runs close to two and a half hours, but feels like a mere 70 minutes. DiCaprio is perfect as young Abagnale, Hanks is (as always) marvelous as Handratty, but the best performance in the film comes from Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. Walken owns every scene he's in. He's absolutely brilliant. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a very different film for Spielberg, but he shows once again that in the movie business, he's the very best."
5,Catch Me If You Can - - Review by Zef,This DVD was wonderful. It had fairly good special features. The movie was great. Good acting by Tom Hanks.
4,Like The Road Runner and Coyote,"This was a very enjoyable film. Not being a big Leo fan I was reluctant to even watch this film. But word of mouth convinced me to take a look and I was very happy I did. The character Leo portrays was brillant pure and simple. To pull off what he did at such an early age was incredible. Speilburg does a great job telling this true story in such a manner where there were very few segments that ""dragged"". It was serious at times and funny at times. The supporting cast did a great job. Kudos to Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. Even to sets were fantastic. It really looks as if it were the late 60's. This one is a keeper."
4,Twists and Turns up to the last minute!,"I really enjoyed this movie! My DH said, ""Yeah, right. Since when is a Tom Hanks movie really entertaining?"" This movie, from beginning to end, had his attention! It was a true joy to watch the inter-play with Leonardo and the surprises that were around every corner! Highly recommended!An added bonus on the DVD version is the extra disc which highlights the author's true-life story and his commentary on the same. Very interesting man!"
2,Skip It If You Can,"After the excellent ""Minority Report"", Spielberg returns with something completely different in ""Cath Me If You Can"". Given that I wasn`t expecting much from it, this isn`t a big letdown. Unfortunately, this stylish story about a burglar (Leonardo Di Caprio) and his persecutor (Tom Hanks) isn`t all that appealing and becomes just another popcorn flick with a few nice twists. Sure, the direction and acting are great, the soundtrack cool enough and overall it`s a decent time-capsule picture, however it`s way too long and gets predictable and repetitive. The characters aren`t as deep as they want to be and as a whole the movie lacks substance. Anyway, it still is watchable, there`s a lot worse out there."
2,a small problem,"it turned out that the the movie was in French and would not play in America bwecause it was not a zone one movie. When I asked the seller for the address to send it back, he said to keep the movie. Hopefully, I will meet someone going to Europe who can use this.Betty"
1,BORING,TOO BAD DICAPRIO IS SUCH A BORING ACTOR-- THE STORY ISNT BAD BUT IT AINT MUCH-- THE WHOLE THING SHOULD HINGE ON THE INTERESTING WORK OF THE ACTOR IN THE LEAD ROLE-- HOW ESP IN TH BEGINNING OF HIS ESCAPADES IN FRAUD AND IMPERSONATION HE ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOMES A TEACHER PILOT DOCTOR--- THESE ARE THE MOMENTS THAT A REAL ACTOR WOULD FILL WITH SOMETHING ANYTHING-- BUT DICAPRIO SEEMS ALMOST SOMNABULANT IN THE ROLE---- HE HAS NO PERSONALITY LET ALONE MORE THAN ONE !! SHAME ON YOU SHPPPPPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL BERG -PUTTING YER SCRIPT IN THE HANDS OF SUCH INCOMPETENCE ----IT`LL MAKE MONEY THO AND GARNER PRAISE-- BUT DONT BELIEVE ANY OF IT-- THIE MOVIE IS A BORING DUD
1,Catch me if you can,"I ordered the movie for my father for christmas and when he opened it, the dvd was worped and would not work, so I am going to try and send it back but we live in oklahoma and I live in Tulsa and my father lives in another town. The problem is we have had a big ice storm and we have not been able to get together since christmas and he did not discover the problem until i had returned back to tulsa,so just one of those things but hopefully I can return it thanks for asking Sally Robertson"
4,"Hanks, DiCaprio great combination",one of DiCaprio's best. Tom Hanks is great in it and the fact that this story is based on true events is crazy. a great cat and mouse chase. I've seen it a few times now and every time i can't leave the room. great movie.
4,Cash Me If You Can,"A well polished film based on the true story of a con-artist who for a time outsmarted the allmighty F.B.I. in his forgery and circulation of false cashier's checks.The film is a light drama surrounding the character of Leonardo DiCaprio who finds himself on his own at an early age. He soon learns that he has good skills in being a con-man and forging checks to get paid. He continues this scam for years but the F.B.I. under an agent played by Tom Hanks is on his tail. The U.S. being too hot, he soon goes in hiding in France to continue his life of crime.This is a great film in every sense. It is a touching drama but remains on the humorous note throughout the film. DiCaprio played his role very well as did Christopher Walken as his father. Tom Hanks essentially played himself as always but at least his mediocre acting skills did not tarnish the film in anyway as his character was as rigid as Joe Friday. This is a good film to watch by the entire family: check it out!"
4,GLIB CAPER WITH DELICIOUS 60s ESCAPISM,"An amusing if overdrawn double martini blend of scams and flirtation that etches its light-hearted arc with good old fashioned tale of a lovable rogue pursued relentlessly by a single-minded cop, who over time develops a paternalistic interest in his prey.The touchy feely moments are fortunately never too campy and the cheeky ones never too risque. Most of the Oh-so-cool pilot moments are probably a bit dated (pilots being little more than commercial chauffers today, unlike their glam roles 30 years ago) but De Caprio oozes a dark chocolate blend of slick charm and lonely-boy vulnerability.The opening sequence (of title credits) has a fabulously artistic Saul Bass type sketch video that alone is worth the price of the dvd. Which is great because the DVD has fairly few features otherwise.Don't expect a classic, but for a breezy evening to pass the time, catch this if you can."
3,"Unbelievable, but True!","I heard about this story back in 1980 when the book came out. So naturally, I was very interested in how the movie would play out. The story of Frank W. Abagnale is told with some humor and some melodrama by Director Steven Spielberg. DiCaprio and Hanks give very good performances in this unbelievable, but true tale. Not one of Spielberg's best, but very entertaining."
4,GREAT PRETENDER,"I was surprised to find that this movie entertained me. Not that I was expecting it to be horrible, but I definitely was not expecting anything truly entertaining. I am not much of a Leonardo diCaprio fan, so I am skeptical anytime I see one of his films. However, he did very well in his role, and conveyed both the excitement and anxiety of being someone in his position (pretending and always on the run to be one step ahead of the law). Also appealing were Tom Hanks and the actors portraying diCaprio's parents, Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye.A couple of things annoyed me though (because something inevitably does): 1. Jennifer Garner. I don't care how popular she becomes. I find her miserably annoying. 2. The strange and too long intro to the movie with stick figure drawings. It, oddly enough, practically tells the whole story... and as I said, goes on for too long."
1,Hustle is Right,"The only hustle here is the poor sap who gets hustled into spending bucks to see this movie because it stinks. Stinks big time. It looks like they took two dollars and got the cheapest sets and cameras they could and they begged their next door neighbors to be in the movie. The so-called hot guy isnt hot either, and if you cant figure out who Mr. Smith is ten minutes into the movie you need to get out more often. Waste of time and money."
1,The cure for insomnia,"Having trouble getting to sleep? Get this movie with its bad acting, bad music, bad lighting, bad sound, and a restaurant that never has any customers, and you'll be out cold before the second act.The only reason I made it through this snorer is that I was waiting for the twist. The relationship between Mr Smith and his hustler is so obvious that I figured it must be a setup. Well, it's just exactly what you think it is, so there's no need to wait around."
2,"Interesting Movie, but poor copy",The movie was interesting and engaging. And the character Bobby is extremely attractive. But the copy of the video is bad and it is often hard to hear the conversations even at maximum volume.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,The only thing that might be good about this film is its cover art work. Even that leaves a lot to be desired. I wish I hadn't wasted the time watching it. I would have given it negative stars but it wasn't an option.
3,Another Surf Album,"Another nice collection from Golly Gee Records. A double album which has been ""re-mixed and re-mastered"", it suffers from muffled sound on a number of the songs. However, it does provide some different arrangements of surf standards, so if you are looking for something of a change up, give it a try."
3,Decent for the money...,I should have gone for something just a tiny bit better because these items last a LONG time and this one is JUST SHORT of what I would have liked to see. It sticks down well to the table. It is nice because the kids can see through it. It turns well and sharpens well. Only fits one size pencil. Doesnt spin 100% evenly.
5,Excellent,"Exactly what we wanted in a pencil sharpener. Razor sharp pencils, strong suction base, easy to operate for whole family.We ordered this after being disappointed with another model. This answered the bill."
2,Good sharpener but not for classroom use,"At home this would have been an excellent sharpener. My ninth graders destroyed this sharpener after a couple of months. First the plastic barrel broke. I used duct tape. Then the suction started to release, they move it all the time and pull on it to test it. Finally the sharpener itself stopped sharpening some pencils. I'm looking for an all metal manual sharpener now."
4,X-acto Pencil Sharpner,Does what it is supposed to do. Vacumn seal to hold it still works well. Good product for the money
5,Does the trick!,"I have a number of cats and area rugs--a challenging mix! The vacuum just wasn't getting the hair up as I'd like (and I have a very good vacuum). I knew when I was walking with sneakers that if I scuffed them, it would pull up the hair, so when I saw this product, I wanted to try it--and it works just as I'd imagined. It takes a little bit of elbow grease, but I've got plenty of that and it really does take up so much extra hair that I'm pleased as punch. Highly recommend this for someone with pets who's not satisfied with just the vacuum."
3,worth paying for,"I really like using this broom to get the hair out of my rugs - I have a few rugs on top of my hardwood floors, and they collect every hair, lintball, fuzz, and dustflake in the room. Its a workout to use the One Sweep to clean them up, but it does a better job than a vacuum."
3,Somtimes the original isn't the best.,"This is the second "" One Sweep "" I bought. The last one was purchased about 5-6 years ago and it served me well until recently when the rubber bristles having dryed out started to break off. The one most reciently purchased came missing a row of bristles and apeared to have been used. Around the same time I bought a similar broom called "" Sweepa "" which was lighter slightly smaller and the rubber seemed much softer than the One Sweep. At first I thought this would be a liability but as it turned out it enhanced the "" squeege action "" of the broom.In conclusion I can't decide if the Sweepa is a better product or if the One Sweep I received was just defective or old. I will say either way if you never used one of these rubber brooms your in for a treat. Either product does an outstanding job picking dust up on both hardwood and viynal tiles."
2,"No, it's not possible for one man to make nine good movies a year.","So, there's no point in reviewing these four ""Classic"" John Wayne movies on their own, since they're all exactly the same thing. John Wayne comes into town, meets Gabby Hayes, gets into some shenanigans and then kisses some annoying girl.I appreciate all the stunt riding and gun slinging that went into these 1930's Lone Star Productions films, but unfortunately they're so poorly produced it's hard to notice the good stuff. And Digiview piles some extra crap onto the last film on the disc by adding some unnecessary, hackey background synth music. If you're a huge John Wayne fan then this budget disc is a good way to see some of his early budget movies, but I can't think of another reason to reccommend this.Here are the four movies on the disc:The Dawn Rider (1935)Blue Steel (1934)The Lucky Texan (1934)The Man from Utah (1934)"
5,fantastic,"i found this book remaindered for a very low price, but it is totally worth the full list price. a respectful, intelligent look at the great man Fred Rogers and his TV show that isn't even a TV show, really... varying points of views. the essayists only occasionally become too weirdly academic or navel-gazing. i like the production values on this hardcover, too -- it's fully cloth-covered with a full cloth, smythe-sewn binding, acid free paper, and neat endpapers. the back cover photo rules, too. 2003 May 3rd is the Mr Rogers memorial ceremony in downtown pittsburgh -- go!"
2,No longer supported. Headphones were okay.,"I had purchased this a few years ago and it worked on my older computer (which ran XP) but would not work on my newer computer which also ran XP. Not sure what the reason was, but it was disappointing, especially considering that I spent far more than it is worth now.The headphones got well used, though. They had a reasonably nice sound and we even enjoyed using the program a bit on my old computer, but I notice now (Oct.2010) the company listed on my box no longer exists, or they have totally changed and sell a different product and don't seem to support Singing Coach. I'd buy it again just for the headphones... if it comes down in price to what those are worth, that is. It's still selling a bit high."
1,No Technical Support--Do not buy!!,"I purchased this product and could not install it because of the many errors in the software. My computer is up-to-date, and I usually have no problems installing software. When I called for technical support, I found that Electronic Learning Products no longer supports their product. If you have problems, they will not help you. When you call their number, you get a recording stating the date they stopped helping--no other option given.Please note other reviews from people who also had trouble with installation and use.Please buy a product from a company that stands behind what they sell.I wish I would have purchased this from Amazon. Unfortunately, I did not and will not get my money back."
1,DO NOT BUY - WILL NOT WORK AND VENDOR WON'T FIX,"extremely poor item. i tried installing on 4 different machines running xp and it would not work on any correctly. the singing coach portion does not work at all while some other modules will work they do not work correctly. the voice analysis function is useless becaause it is meant to work with the singing lessons portion which, as i said, does not function at all. to add insult to injury the manufacturers website will not allow you to download the free songs promised, has no downloadable updates and only tells you to wait and purchase their new version out in spring 2010. this is one of the worst products i have had the misfortune of trying to get working and can't beleive they have the gall to continue to sell a defective product with no support and only try to sell you a newer version - which probably won't work either! i was so looking forward to this product and was extemely freustrated. DO NOT BUY."
4,Singing Coach Unlimited,"This was recommended at a workshop I attended. It's what I was expecting except for the number of songs that came with it. I was expecting a larger number of titles, although I can't complain since there are 12 more free downloads that come with the package. Some of the lyrics are not the standard lyrics so it's confusing for someone who knows the traditional lyrics."
1,Does not work,"I just ordered this program and it does not work on XP...kept getting a error message. I tried running it in compatibility mode but no luck.I would definitely not recommend this product. It cannot be returned because it has been opened! Just how are you to know it doesn't work until you open it??? Poor return policy for software, especially since the company that made this is no longer supporting it. Don't waste your money."
1,Waste Of Money,This was a waste on money for me. I am running XP Home and this is not working. Nothing I am doing will work. So all in all I can't even get passed the frist welcome screen with out it saying error and closing out on me. I dont even get to use it.. Waste
3,Good for beginning voice training,"Singing Coach Unlimited is helpful software for someone first beginning voice training or for ""retuning"" your voice after a long idle time. However, the lessons appear to be geared toward kids. I found the pitch tracking to be a nice feature.The compose feature is limited and will only allow composing the melody (no accompaniment).The ability to change keys for any song is great.The song download selection from Carry-A-Tune is limited, although you can import songs form other sources.I have had some software glitches (recording failures and recording delays) on my Windows XP PC which meets the recommended system requirements. (Carry-A-Tune has not yet responded with a fix.)"
1,Keep Original Packaging!!!,"I run WinXP Pro. this program is not compatible. And when you e mail customer support for assitance, all you will get is a automated mail telling you to. Turn off any anti-virus programs and lower your internet browser security setting to low. After 4 days, many e-mails, phone calls, and alot of waiting I can honestly say they were worthless.People who have trouble installing should. (it just can't be me!)1. remove the current shockwave player and go to their web site and install a fresh copy2. Install program.3. Wait for singing lesson section start then freeze4. Return CD in packaging5. Thank Amazon for having a easy return policy"
3,would've been disappointed if I paid full price on manufacturer's website,"Just wanted to say that the full price I think was $99 on the ""official web-site links"". Don't pay that! The files are midi which is strange to the common person. I has some cool features and some cheesey features. I would recommend trying it out before buying it if possible. I am not disappointed overall for the price I paid which was about $30 and it came with the microphone."
2,I'm returning the item...,"When I got the Singing Coach Unlimited, I was very excited. It was a birthday gift from my mom. When I was installing it, I knew things were not going to turn out well. I had to try to install it about 5 times before it finally worked. When it finally did install, it just didn't work even though my computer met all the system requirements. The audio in the program would stop after a few words. I didn't even get to use the program. I was very disappointed. But putting all that aside, I would like to say that Amazon.com makes returning items easy as can be!"
1,Doesn't Work,"Maybe I got a bad copy, but I couldn't even install this software on any of my computers and I'm a certified computer repair tech."
2,Has promise; Older technology; Non-existant email tech support,"I have not been able to fully use the product since I'm unable to get the lessons to function properly. I've taken and sent screen shots, gathered configurations and log file to Carry-a-Tune's e-mail support with no response. Even have followed up with additional emails.I've also noticed their website hasn't been updated in years. In fact it doesn't reflect the changes in the retail industry (they still show CompUSA as my local supplier when in fact there hasn't been a local CompUSA for a long time)."
1,Don't Buy this software,"CHECK THE FINE PRINT This software is discontinued item and no longer supported by the manufacturer. They barely even admit that they ever made the software. I managed to get a response from ELP Products and their response was basically ""tuff cookies"" we don't support that product any more but we will let you know if you want to buy some of our other products.AND is does not work.I installed it on two different systems and the the most important part, the singing lessons module does not function!! There is no longer any online links that work so forget about adding any songs or getting any help at all. The sad part is the other feature of the software work and seem like it would have been fun, though a little child like in it's presentation.I realize it was discounted but still...move the tiny print about being discontinued to the head of the listing. I an gonna attempt to return it."
1,Not Vista Compatible,I could not make this program run under Vista. As of May 2010 the company no longer supports this version and provides no tech support.
1,DOESN'T work with Windows Vista,There are not any updates to work with Vista and the company tech line doesn't return phone calls. I don't recommend the Product!!! NOR THE COMPANY TECH SUPORT!!!! HORRIBLE!
1,doesn't work anymore,It worked and was pretty cool until I upgraded to windows7 then it stopped working. Reinstall doesn't work not even in compatibility mode. Wasted my money on this one. They really should have a patch to download or something.
1,limited use,This is not a bad system if all you want to do is record your practice sessions. However the written music often comes without standard notes and you can't go far with the system.
1,Please read before you buy!!!,"OK, I was about to purchase this item, and decided to read the one-star reviews (I usually don't do this, but something told me to do it this time.) You'll read comments that it doesn't work on MOST operating systems, and the thing that bothered me most is their TOTAL LACK of customer support. IF you do decide to purchase this, please check it out with the BBB before you make the mistake of throwing your $$ away. The comments I've read were enough to convince me. Thanks everyone for saving me a lot of time and aggravation. Scary- this could be on ""American Greed!""Lillie"
2,Misleading,"I was expecting much more than what I got. There are 25 songs but they're all juvenile songs. You can download some but I guess I just expected more help with pitch than what this provides. For the money, it's not worth it."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I found this product to be difficult to use, and not very helpful as a practicing tool. The flash animation was too elaborate, and slowed my computer up to the point where the sceen was not keeping up with my perfomance. But that could just be my computer's fault. What annoyed me most of all was how I was being graded on my ability to hold a note exactly, instead of using inflections and vibrato, etc. So, although a good idea in theory, it was not worth the price I paid."
5,"I chose to revisit an old, admired artist.","Banes is such a talent. I have made one of her earlier neck pieces and am very fond of it. Whether or not I do another piece, it was a pleasure to see this book,"
3,a little dry,"It's a little dry, and feels a little dated, but overall it's a good video. Worth the 5 bucks or so I paid for it, not sure it'd be worth more than that though."
1,Tell me Ernest Haycox didn't write this!,"This is so bad that I was unable to finish the book, the copyright is by P.F. Collier & Son in 1933 which leads me to believe that it was published as a serial by Collier's magazine. The story as far as I was able to read was about a small rancher returning to his ranch after recovering from an ambusher's bullet and is immediately shot at again only this time by a mysterious beautiful woman, all of the women in these westerns are beautiful but most of the guys(besides the hero)are rather gruesome, how about a little equality here:-), of course there is the big bad rancher that wants our hero's ranch for the water and of course it was his hired gun that shot said hero. I think that all of the writers of the time signed contracts to write x number of books per year for their publisher and I believe that the quality of their writing suffered for these contracts, I have noticed this in Luke Short and Louis L'Amour among others."
2,Wait for the MW4 RPG...,"Although the Mechwarrior 3 RPG had some interesting aspects to it and was fairly detailed, overall I didn't like it. The 3rd edition system tried to divorce itself from the popular standard Battletech line; this resulted in its failure which was even conceded by the game line developer (Randall Bills) on the official Classic Battletech site. The fourth edition of the Battletech RPG is coming out called, A Time of War, so unless you're hooked on the 3rd edition rules or are a collector, I'd wait for the 4th edition."
5,great but...,"Great but the damage system could have done better. I mean ""Wound Values"" c'mon. Everything else was great."
4,Kick Dis,"Cool product, can be used indoor or outdoor. Soft padding on sides protects wall and furniture. Glides easily across hard surfaces. A little noisy for indoors, sounds like a small hand vacuum."
3,kick dis power puck,"the idea is a good one. however is it very noisy, sounds like a vacuum cleaner. it's almost impossible to open the battery compartment to install the batteries.(the battery compartment screws were stripped straight out of the box)within a 1/2 hour of play one stopped working, one had battery compartment issues and the batteries could not be installed. i bought 3 as christmas gifts and all are being returned."
5,Biblical Truth,Today many Christians are in a daze when it comes to properly discerningwhat the Scriptures have to say about the last days. So many have beenignorantly deceived by well meaning and intentioned teachers who basetheir understanding of Scripture on a Dispensational hermenuetic.Ralph Woodrow cuts through the smoke and mirrors employed by Dispensationalistsproviding the reader with clear and concise explanations of how most prophecyhas already been fulfilled.
4,4 stars,"In the Rogues series, Simon has been in Canada in search of adventure, and finds it--he's in the middle of a duel instigated because he accused a man of corruption, when Jane, the niece of the friend with whom he's been residing, interrupts, saying that her uncle is dying.Uncle Isaiah, on his deathbed, begs the two to wed, for his niece's protection. Unfortunately, Jane isn't really Jane--she's her illegitimate sister Nan, also known as Jancy.They plan to settle Isaiah's estate, then return to England, but there's the matter of the aborted duel and the associated corruption, the secret hanging over Jancy's head, and the impending death of Simon's uncle and cousin, putting him unexpectedly in line for an earldom.Lots of romance and adventure, and a really nice portrayal of how keeping a big secret (Jancy's true identity) can eat at you."
2,Disappointed....,"I was very disappointed in this book. First off, the book centered around too much death. The main character spent more time in mourning than anything else. Secondly, when Jancy finally reveals her true identity and that she's been lying to Simon this whole time, he doesn't even get mad. He just shrugs it off and acts as if it's not that big of a deal. How can lying about who you really are not be that big of a deal? Furthermore, when it becomes known who was trying to, more or less, sabatoge them, one page is dedicated to fighting and threatning this person to never show their face again. One of the plots in the story is about the ""papers"" and to just end it like that is disappointing. I wasn't very happy with the book; I wouldn't have finished reading it, but I wanted to get my money's worth and though it would get better as the story line went along. I was wrong."
5,compelling read with a different twist,"I love Jo Beverley and she never disappoints. This Rogue book combines a plot centering on the class divisions in English society with the problems of sea travel and Indians in the New World. I really liked the main characters, although, as is typical of Jo Beverley characters, they have their flaws. I also found the book to be very fast moving, held my interest all the way through, and I wasn't sure of the villain until he appeared!! A wonderful read, and I was sorry to finish it!Cynthia Mcginnes"
4,miracle suit,"Suit fits but the lining at the top is not thick enough, I will have to put a bra liner in it."
4,Not as heavy as I expected,"Great look, but these were not as heavy as I expected for a stainless steel glass."
2,Rusts easily,Not sure why Stainless Steel is rusting but it is. I have to scrub the heck out of them whenever they are used and dry well - but still rust forms on the bottom.
1,Poor workmanship!,"I purchased both the Stainless steel martini glasses and the Stainless steel Margarita glasses and was very disappointed. The first box of two seemed to be ok, but upon opening the second box, I found one glass was broken. The ""Weld spot"" broke and the stem of the glass was off. I opened the Margarita glass set and those too were broken. I decided to wash by hand the remaining glasses for use, and another glass ""weld spot"" broke. All in all, I was very disappointed in this product. Think before you purchase these!"
3,Visually Appealing But Too Lightweight,"The goblets have a snazzy modern look and a nice shape. However, they are too lightweight, which causes them to tip easily. I tried the goblet several times and spilled some of the drink on myself as I raised it to my mouth; I also knocked it over and spilled a drink multiple times. I'm going to try gluing a steel weight to the bottom to make it more functional."
4,Great for outside use,I ordered this so i could drink martinis outside and not worry about dropping my good glasses.They seem pretty steady and pretty good construction. I have started to keep them in the freezer and man let me tell you it keeps the martini nice and cold .
1,Cheap garbage,"Got a set of these. the base broke off of one while washing it. Don't buy, you can tell right off the bat when you open the box they are very cheaply made"
1,Disappointed,The goblet does not have a smooth stainless steel finish giving it an everyday look. Ok for camping or the cottage.
2,Poor quality,"These ""glasses"" won't really break, but the stem comes loose from the bowl. Turning it to tighten it seems to help, but it doesn't hold, and the bowl is also tilted. They are very lightweight and feel pretty flimsy in your hand. I would not recommend these to any one, and surely won't bring them out to impress company!"
2,Leaning martinit glasses,"When my husband opened his gift, the martini glasses were leaning. When he tried to straighten them one broke at the base. Needless to say these glasses were not of a high quality. I also ordered another brand of stainless wine glass for my son and they were made very nicely, so I do know that the brand matters.I will not purchase from this company again."
3,I got what I paid for which isn't very much.,"Like the others have said, these ""glasses"" are cheaply made. Fortunately they didn't break on arrival but one of the glasses is kind of lopsided. If you're the type that likes to fill your glasses to the brim, this can have tragic results. I gave them an extra star because unlike regular glass, these guys will keep your drink very cold! And when it comes to martinis, that's the most important thing, right?"
4,durable but not perfect,"I've owned these for over a year now, which has to be a record for a martini glass since I tend to break them! So these get high marks for durability, although one of them is a little tilted now... when full, I can see from the liquid level that the top part is no longer quite level. I haven't tried to bend things back to straight for fear of making it worse or breaking off the bowl from the stem. It's only a little off level and hardly noticable at all once one has had a couple of martinis.I still prefer the feel of a nice heavy crystal martini glass, and despite some of the other reviews I think a pre-chilled crystal glass keeps my drink cold longer than these stainless steel ones. Being steel, these conduct heat very quickly, which means they chill quickly and also warm quickly. Glass, a poorer conducter of heat, seems to stay cold longer, once it's been thoroughly chilled."
1,Glass broken upon arrival,"I ordered these glasses based on others comments. The 2 glasses arrived on-time, double-boxed (OGGI box within an amazon box with air-packs). The inner OGGI box was undamaged. Inside the OGGI box were 2 glasses, each individually bubble wrapped. The first glass looked fine. The second glass was already broken in 2 pieces, at the ""weld"" (joint) between the upper bowl and stem. I don't know whether it broke during transport or packaging. Either way, I'm not convinced these will stand the test of time."
1,"Nice looking, but not worth a penny","First glass broke after a week at the base. Don't buy this product, it's cheaply made and you will be disappointed."
2,Arrived broken - Disappointing,Ordered two sets of these goblets. Stainless steel was very lightweight and none of the goblets were assembled well (had to tighten the stem and the foot manually when I removed from package). One goblet foot was snapped completely from the stem (not repairable) so they will have to be returned.
2,"If it's bent, live with it.","These things aren't terrible, but if you happen to get one that's slightly off-kilter, don't try to bend it back. The top snaps right off. As far as keeping drinks cold longer, I haven't noticed a difference, even when I store the goblet in the freezer.All in all, a disappointing purchase."
5,Quality,"These are a really nice pair of mechanics gloves. i love using them on my jeep! nice leather grip on the palm and around the index finger and thumb. velcro on the back with some elastic, so they're really comfortable. they just get a little hot after a while... but they're gloves so what do you expect"
4,bringing history to life for kids,"Rebeccasreads recommends DANNY & LIFE ON BLUFF POINT: MY HORSE SALLY -- Book 5 of this series for ages 9-12.It is a gladsome, simple introduction to another way of looking at history. The series is taken from the author's grandfather's journals & is packed with adventures & details about the everyday lives of the settlers of Yates County, New York State in the 1890s, complete with charming primitive drawings, & lessons about citizenship & American Indian life."
2,"Boring, Dull, Uninteresting, and Redundant... with a tad bit of information","This textbook is, put simply, unhelpful. I used it with an introductory child psychology course, and I'm confident that I would have done just as well without the book (and, in fact, I stopped reading the book after about six dreadfully long, dull, and redundant chapters). I don't know what makes the authors desire to repeat themselves over and over and over and over again, but they do, and it makes this book awful to read. There isn't much in terms of information in this text, either, despite its massive size. It is, furthermore, poorly organized and expensive.I recommend not purchasing this book, even if it is a ""required"" text. You will find better, more comprehensive, and more interesting information for free online."
5,Should have purchased sooner,I should have purchased this when I purchased my quick connect laser. I always had to put my laser in my pocket when I holstered my weapon but not anymore. This item works with a wide variety of flashlights & lasers.
4,Quite educational & fun!,"My 2-year-old son LOVES this video! And I must admit, the fire truck portion is quite interesting. Yes, it is dated and cheesy, but the information presented was an eye-opener. I honestly never knew that much about firefighters! And there's just enough excitement to keep kids interested, especially once the fire alarm goes off and the sirens start to wail. And no, the firefighters are not actors -- they are real people, which I really appreciate.But note: Once Hard Hat Harry comes on in the next segment, it's best to shut it off. That guy is just painful to watch, and my son can only deal with him so long as well.Bottom line: For only $6, it's worth it for the fun and educational value of the fire truck segment."
1,JUNK--most of them are--,"We have trains and planes and my three year old and one year old love it. So I bough airplanes and helicopters, fire engines and construction, and cars and motorcycles. THESE ARE TOTAL JUNK!!! The picture shows race cars and action scenes. None of that happens. It's some stupid actor with a few kids talking the entire time about magic and all the parts of an engine while they hang out in a service station. OH THAT'S FUN FOR KIDS!!!Or have a fireman stand by a truck in the station and pull out and point at every fixture and piece of equipment with the most monotone drone that goes on and on. What are they thinking?My three year old said, ""There's just talking. Where are the cars?"" He thought it was a preview to the actual dvd. Then he said, ""It's just too boring Mama. Watch something else.""Luckily they only cost a few dollars each but I am trying to contact gtmediausa.com to get my money back."
2,Stay away,"These ""All About"" videos are interesting for kids, but parents will be taken aback. They are ""hosted"" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a very strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures. I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc. Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester. Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly - in the early 1980's. We are not buying any more of this series, and now have to explain to our kids about talking to strangers."
5,"DAMN, THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN.","Now I am gonna explain why this album is rad. Now first off I bought 2000 fold the day it came out and I am a huge SOB fan. I love the feel of this new album, its fresh and stylish. I like that they just didnt do the same old stuff. Now all of you who think its a gangster attitude are wrong. Its not gangster, its angry, dont confuse gangster with angry. Gangsters talk about pimpin their hoes and drivin their cars, but SOB never talks about that stuff. The angry lyrics go with the guitar riffs and raw feel of this album. It feels a lot like Jedi Mind Tricks, who are far from gangster but have heavy angry raps. All yall who think they sold out need to go listen again and get your head straight about whats hip-hop and whats not."
2,Bummed on it,"Styles of beyond are one of my most played artists in my collection of music and one of my most favorite underground groups. I have been bumpin these guys for years and always get excited when I show them to my friends. Sadly, this album was not what i expected. What I hoped for was something similar to 2000 fold, amazing flows and original beats. There are 4 songs on this album that are listenable but not even worthy to the worst song on 2000 fold. Many of you are hating what im saying right now, but this is just my opinion. They brought on the start for my fantastic underground hip hop voyage to begin with and i owe it all to 2000 fold. But thats a different review. I hope their next album doesnt turn to hip-pop. But i will always love SOB no matter what."
4,zahrone_bumps_SOB,"just as good as album #1... ryu and tak are like yin n yang...cheapshot breaks down some sick beats... if you wanna listen to real hip hop music and not hip hop product, this is the album you should purchase...and if you dont have album #1 - wake up!"
2,ummmm.2 1/2 stars,I't stinks. What the hell happened.there like annoying and stuff now> OUCH!Is it possible to reverse growth. Well looks like SOB did. There sound now isjust juvenile.
4,youre aware its all covers?,"the cd is awesome, they cover so many styles of hip hop its quite amazing, and master each one at that. the majority of it is covers, which is weird, cause they arent covering typical songs and they arent true covers in the sense they sing the same words as the originals because they do original ryhmes over songs stolen from iggy pop, rolling stones, bob marley and a number of others. its cool tho, great album."
3,megadef!!!!!,"well its been what 2 years new since styles of beyond has released a new lp, well when i heard the 1st track ""MEGADEF"" with the guitar loop i was skeptical, i was like ""this sh*t is gonna be whack"" but i listened to the track with an open mind and it grew on me, ryu and takbir's flows are flawless and straight up sick,over all i think the album is dope and definitly worth the buy for it's cheap price. my 2 favorite tracks would have to go to ""mr.brown"" and ""playing with fire.ft.apathy and celph titled"" cop this album its ill.p.s. THE FLAVOR CRYSTALS(CHEAPSHOT & VIN SKULLY) do a great job holding down the album prodcution wise."
1,Lee Ritnour at Cocoanut Grove,"This DVD is terrible! It's in Japanese.... the tunes are cool, but I did not know that Lee spoke Japanese. It's not Japenese overdub, he's actually singing in Japenese. It was just TOO wierd to watch. So, unless you like cool Jazz sung in Japensese, don't get this one"
5,New Help From Old Source,"I truly did not expect this book to be as thoroughly helpful as I found it. I thought it would just be another book on ""meditation"" that spent 100 pages telling me to say one word over & over again. The big difference is the approach. The explanations re: research, the changes in wording that make you view things from a totally different perspective such as ""remembered wellness"", & the methods to re-set your mind when it gets pulled off track were all things I had not found from other sources. As a Registered Nurse, I also found it to be very medically appropriate to what not only I, but also my patients were experiencing. By giving not just the two options of physician/pharmaceutical medicine & alternative medicine, we are given a third option that requires no expense or outside intervention & gives us power over our own health. I look forward to reading the other books by this author that further the subject."
3,"Not life-changing, but interesting","I'd already bought into the fact that ""meditating is good for your health"" when someone recommended I read this book. Because many reviewers wrote the book ""changed my life!"" I thought it would be more of a how-to-meditate guide. Instead, it was mostly a review of studies that proved that meditating was good for you. It had a few tips that make up the cornerstone of successful meditation practices, and those same tips are repeated throughout the book several times.I don't want to knock this book too much, because it was groundbreaking at the time it was published, as is the author's original research. However, I ended up skimming it for the info that was relevant to me. If you need to prove to yourself or others that meditating/the relaxation response is good for your body how it works, this book is for you. If you want to learn to meditate, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Dated information,"The first half of this book is all background information, some of which is now considered obsolete. Unless you're a medical facts and misinformation junkie, or you are completely in the dark as to what goes on in your body, skip to Chapter 4 and start there. This book is worthwhile from the standpoint that you might pick up a few pointers that will improve your health and quality of life, but don't expect anything ground-breaking if you are well-read on the subject of meditation."
3,Review of Relaxation Response,"I was a little disappointed in the book. The first 90% of the book is spent explaining why meditation works, its background, and throws in some statistics. If you've already bought into the fact that meditation works as a stress-management tool (lower BP, better sleep, etc), you can skip to the end, or just do a web search on the topic. Seemed like lots of filler to me."
1,available for ten times less money elsewhere,This tape is now available as a CD for about fifteen bucks from mghgeneralstore and is now called the Bring Relaxation To Your Life by Olivia Hoblitzelle. It is the Olivia CD referred to by Herbert Benson in his book Relaxation Revolution. It has been used for over a decade in his published medical studies. A much better buy for your money for a medically proven product.
3,Repeat after me,"Not exactly what I was expecting when I purchased the book but interesting nonetheless. If you are looking for the 'how do I do this', its basically encapsulated on a couple of pages.The rest of the book is devoted to the process that the author went through to discover and validate that there is a physiological 'relaxation response' and the ways that it affects people."
5,"Read This Classic , Learn to Meditate, Alter Your Life",This is an absolutely priceless treatise on certain forms of meditation and their benefits. Dr. Benson demystifies meditation as an occult religious ritual and highlights all the scientifically researched practical benefits of starting and maintaining this wonderful practice. You will never purchase and read a more valuable introduction and tutorial on the subject! If you are reading this review you were meant to purchase and use this book. Just do it!
4,The Relaxation Response,"I suffer from high blood pressure, and I attribute most of this maledy to stress. The guidance this book has provided me and the practice of the ideas is simply good for anybody. It is helping me to bring my blood pressure down, and I have found calmness in everyday. I couldn't say that prior. The book isn't a magic bullet against all that ails or is it?"
3,"Helpful, but dated information","This book provided an invaluable synopisis of groundbreaking research into the importance of mind-body integration in medical science. However, some of the attempts at comparative cultural analyis seemed ethnocentric and just plain wrong in some instances. It remains curious that there was never any open acknowledgement that the instuctions given to elicit ""the relaxation response"" are precisely the same as meditation. Is this simply a renamed technique for those who, for whatever reason, are disinclined to acknowledge they meditate?"
2,The Relaxation Response,I thought this book would be great given the reviews despite it's age. In a couple of words I found it boring and useless.
3,good but not absolutely convincing,"This book is certainly an alternative to Transcendental Meditation. A person reading and mastering this book no longer has to spend the money to be taught by a TM teacher. Moreover, it clears up all the mysteries surrounding TM. TM is a good and effective way to invoke the power and wisdom of the subconscious mind and not infallible magic.The most significant part of this book is the part dealing with the rules of eliciting Relaxation Response. The rest deals with basic medical and phisiological knowledge concerning stress and its related problems together with the test results the author used to justify the techniques he advocated.I agree with him 100% but I am not sure if these theories and results can convince readers from all walks of life.To me, poring over Charles Haanel's 'Master Key' and practicing the techniques in this book will be absolutely great and convincing."
3,Relaxation Response Book in 2004,"While I have read the book, I can only imagine and possibly agree that it was a monumental breakthrough of research and findings when it was first published.Upon reading it from a Year 2004 perspective, I found the first half of the book dealt ONLY with the medical aspects of stress on a person. It is not until you get to the SECOND half of the book, that it introductions relaxation techniques.In addition, the stress factors they cite (divorce, loss of job, death in the family, new child, etc.) are out of date in terms of the ratings scale that was used in the year the book first was published.NOT necessarily an easy read, but has merit, if you keep it in a time perspective."
3,166 Quickies,"Sorting through many of the American Indian Myths (As if there was a homogenized group called American Indians) Richard Erdoes and Alfonzo Ortiz selected 166 short, one or two page, stories. These stories look like the pre-curser to the urban legends today.The myths are artificially separated into ten subjects and lose the continuity of being divided by particular ethnic group; thus we never get a feel for the bigger picture of where the stories come from.You need a great sense of humor as many of the stories are very kinky such as ""TEETH IN THE WRONG PLACE"" (PONCA-OTOE), which is exactly what it implies.There seems to be only three Zuni tales out of the 166. I wonder if there is a reason for this.The Boy Who Made Dragonfly: A Zuni Myth"
4,Great!,"I have ordered so many books online that I haven't gotten to read any of this last book I got. But I started to worry about getting my book on time because I'm going on vacation soon and I could only afford standard shipping. So, I was extremely pleased to get my item in the mail today before I leave for vacation. It arrived in great condition and pretty quickly too. Overall--great!"
4,An elegant introduction to Native American mythology.,"Very short pieces describing the myths and legends of variousnative american peoples. Some of these tales were recountedorally in the early 1900s and transcribed -- lucky for us.It's interesting to note the similarities between the mythsof the different tribes and our own culture, whatever thatmay be. I personally enjoy the stories of the world beingon a turtle's back...."
5,Great Solution for mounting a disco ball on a truss,"use this plate with an ""O"" clamp and its great to mount a disco ball on a truss!"
3,The Puritan vs the Pragmatist,"""To Kill a King"" or what do we do now that we've deposed Charles I? Strong performances [especially from Rupert Everett] grace this story of the relationship between Oliver Cromwell and General Fairfax as they struggle to cope with the consequences of deposing King Charles I. Alas, the script isn't up to the acting, and we've given Cromwell as a fanatical monster with homoerotic leanings and a rather stody Fairfax.Nevertheless, this a film for thinking adults; it deals with ideas and not just bloodlust. But major points off for the terrible voiceovers."
3,Okay Drama Looks Great,"Don't be fooled by the fact that this didn't get released in theaters and has an anemic trailor -- it's an impressively lavish production. Scott's a bit of a cipher as Fairfax, but Roth is quite good as Cromwell. (He looks a lot like Danny Bonaduce here, do you notce?)"
3,To Kill a King,"I found this movie enjoyable. The court of Charles I is not one that I am overly familiar with, but as far as I could tell, the movie was not glaringly inaccurate in its presentation. I thought the actors did a good job of portraying their characters- from idealistic to angry to then being quite disturbed by how far their actions had taken them- to kill a king. I didn't think the storyline had anything very new to offer, but as a historical film, it was pretty good- I do love costume drama, so it fit the bill pretty well!"
3,A Lesson In Character,"More than anything, the impression I was left with was the uncompromising positions of two headstrong characters: Cromwell and Charles. Both had good arguments in their support but, each driven by separate and equally fanatical religious ideologies, they could brook no compromise. Rupert Everett ably played King Charles to the letter, though Roth's Cromwell seemed much smaller than its original. Though not the best film from an historical point of view, philosophically engaging."
2,Beautiful scenes and costumes. I felt like watching a play on stage not a movie.,The move contains beautiful scenes and costumes. I felt like watching a play on stage not a movie. It's better to read a history book.
4,Nice film of an facinating era,"Great cast and interesting story about an era of history that is often overlooked.I've enjoyed Dougray Scott since seeing him in Ever After, this film is a whole different role for him despite yet again being in a historical ""fantasy"" film.And with the excellent Tim Roth as Cromwell and Rupert Everett as Charles I, reprising the monarch he played in Stage Beauty if I recall correctly, it's great period piece and worth watching. I personally really enjoy this era of English history and would like to see more movies made in this time period."
1,Absolute rubbish; a waste of money,"I agree with the critical reviews below.This is a travesty of history; even ""Cromwell"" was better than this. If this is the best the British film industry can do, I shall never make fun of Hollywood again.There are so many factual errors it is not worth listing them.This is not a criticism of the actors, however - only the script. If you know nothing about the Civil War, then you might enjoy the film."
4,Not too excited,The movie didn't move me as i hoped it wold but it is otherwise entertaining. I like mike action fast and furious and this one did not deliver.
3,A rental,"While I am a fan of everything Tim Roth has done, but at times this simply drags. The base story has the potential for tremendous drama, but neither the script nor the production rises to the occasion. There are a few good scenes here and there, but overall, think of it as a rental."
2,English history drama has good cast but feels short & incomplete,"This film is the story (and some side story) about Oliver Cromwell's overthrow of King Charles in England. The cast does a solid job with the weak screenplay they are given, as the character development is limited in this overly short historical drama. This works more as a TV movie, and could have been made into a miniseries to provide for more context and greater connection with the characters. This solid cast deserves more room to show their craft... good historical dramas are usually long films because you need more time to help viewers gain an emotional engagement with the main characters and an understanding of the times in which the story occurs. The one historical lesson from this film that I found was that those who overthrow tyrants will often display the same tyrannical tendencies that they fought against. Historical themes do repeat!"
1,Gadzooks!,"This film lacks an essential ingredient: a statement that ""any resemblance between characters and events shown and actual historical events is purely accidental."" It is of negative value as a history film, in that the viewer is left more ignorant of what happened in 1645-1649+ than he was before he saw the film even if he originally knew nothing at all. The film ""Cromwell,"" for all its own faults, is much better. Try comparing the trial scenes of the two films. It's a pity that so much money and talent were wasted to make this embarrassment."
3,A Tedious Account of the English Civil War,"To Kill A King is a tedious account of an argument between Oliver Cromwell and one of his subordinates, Lord Fairfax, over whether or not to execute King Charles I. The film views like an obscure British television show of the sort that is sometimes still shown on Masterpiece Theater. Alright for history buffs, but otherwise avoid."
3,Run of the mill 'costume drama',"Being a history buff, and one with a particular interest in this period, I was surprised to find this film boring far beyond the norm. The costumes and ""sets"" were well done - the difficulty was that the actors did little of note in them.Cromwell, for example, an intriguing if not loveable character in history, comes across here as rather a bored and irritable sort, who expresses emotion by raising an eyebrow. I did not see a genuine hint of the underlying, powerful conflict of the civil war era - tumultuous, violent, but fascinating in itself. One unfamiliar with the period could come away from viewing this film with the impression that it was a time of grumbling between two rivals - with a few bare bums and bosoms here and there just to keep the viewers' interest."
3,The Cromwell Years,"To Kill a King is somewhat interesting. However, I would hesitate to give a strong recommendation. It provides a ""Hollywood"" interpretation of the Cromwell years but with many, but somewhat, inaccurate inclusions to make the film more interesting to the viewer.The film's setting and costumes are good, the story line somewhat drags and the overall depth of the film is lacking. Purchase this film if you have an interest in this period of English history. Otherwise, buy something else."
4,wanted more from this film,"good story, average acting. The story moves a little slow and I had trouble staying interested. overall a good movie, though it nedds a bit more action."
2,Not a small version of a large table,"I was disappointed when this table finally arrived, it is not a small version of a large ping pong table even the grand kids were disappointed with table top quality. If you want a small folding table then this maybe for you but I'm sure you can find it cheaper some where else"
4,mini ping pong table,Great fun for the grandkids and adults. Takes a bit of practice to use the smaller table but ball has a good bounce and return.
2,Not the way it looks in the picture,"I was very disappointed when I received this. In the picture, the outside of the picture frame looks like a brass color, but it's actually a white wood, although not real wood. It makes the frame rather cheap-looking. It's going back, with regret."
5,We Are Framed,"Did not need a big frame, this one was perfect for a 4 x 6 photo. It was a different style not ""just a gold frame all the way around"". I liked the 50th at the top and Anniversary at the bottom--does not look cluttered, and the beige tone inner section was better than a stark white along with the gold edges."
2,"Terrible book, really I should have known better","It's got ""Selfishness"" in the title. It really doesn't endorse healthy views, in my opinion. People are already too selfish."
3,"Cluttered, Too much information","Not sure what happened to my original review, so I'm writing again in hopes of saving someone some money on this book.It seems like this author is very obsessive/compulsive--just look at how many chapters and subtitles are listed--couldn't quite identify where the ""5 steps"" were supposed to be in all of this. I am reading this on Kindle, 45% into it and at first I got a few good tips, but as the book went on, it was just a bit too much.This book appears to be the author cramming everything she ever knew about food into one book and what she suggests to do would take a very long time--I mean years. If you are willing to pick this book apart and do everything and spend years doing it, go for it. But if you are looking for practical things that can be done and change that can happen in a reasonable amount of time, this isn't it."
5,"Life Is Hard, Food is Easy",I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I am a personal trainer and have purchased half a dozen of these for my clients to help them identify their reasons for why they eat when they are not hungry. The book has steps toward identifying emotional eating and then reducing and eliminating destructive patterns. I'd recommend the book.
4,"Great book, although Linda's most recent book is better","Linda Spangle offers great motivation to those serious about weight loss. This book was great, but her newer book 100 Days of weight loss (I think) is even better."
3,Why we over eat,It is very interesing to connect a feeling to a food when overeating. It has helped me to stop and think before reaching for the food the conforts me.
5,Quite the guide!!,"I have already lost 8 lbs. All these years i had nothing to help me, and now i have more information to use to guide me through the tough times! This book is well worth the money. Thank you. Linda"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Was this written for morons? It's like ""The Secret"" scam - another study in the Bloody Obvious. Think about how you feel before you eat - there, I just recapped the entire book and now you don't have to buy it! There are actual people who are in the field for a reason and have the statical and factual information to back up their theories - which make sense! This is written by a nurse who likes to binge on noodle casseroles and finally figured out she was sad. Give me a break - Give us all a break! Overcoming Binge Eating by Christopher Fairburn is the gospel in the field and I've never read anything as impactful as this book. If you're serious about getting control of eating, this is what you need to be reading."
2,*NOT WHAT I EXPECTED*,"I JUST EXPECTED MORE DIRECT ""TELL ME WHAT TO DO"". WELL WRITTEN BUT JUST NOT FOR ME."
4,Good Tips for Any Dieter's Success,"Life is Hard, Food is Easy by Linda Spangle, RN,MA, is a new and highly successful approach to dieting..., or rather learning to eat in a new way for optimal health. Linda is the founder and director of the highly successful WINNERS For Life: Wellness and Weight Loss Clinic. She observed how difficult it is for people to keep off the weight they work so hard to lose. She identifies the emotional factors, different from hunger, that make people eat and helps us establish new patterns to monitor our feeding habits. Her five points explained in the book include: What's going on? What do I feel? What do I need? What's in my way? and What will I do? In learning to seek these answers readers will discover a new way to keep weight at the desired level, create new habits, and feel good about their bodies. A very good companion to any diet!"
5,Changed My Life,"I have read just about everything pertaining to weight loss, food addiction and the psychology behind emotional eating. This book is the best and last I'll ever read. The author speaks to women and men, so my husband could also relate (he could NOT relate to the Geneen Roth books, and neither could I). Thank you, thank you, thank you to the author for giving this subject a fresh perspective that encompasses all of the issues involved in such a dynamic topic."
3,I never knew a dissapointing cd would upset me so.,"Wide angle, was an an astonishing piece of work. Declaring that electronic music was capable of being much more than "" Dance Music"". Many of the tracks were downright beatiful. An amazing dispaly of artistic talent. I have been waiting for this album since the end of the last one, and it really is tough to describe the dissapointment. I'll just say with this album they have fallen into that idea of it being just ""dance music"". Nothing more, nothing less."
3,A journey through steamy streets and blustery altitudes,"An album of high quality, though relatively mild and ""less colorful"" than Hybrid's previous discs. The album's personality slowly emerges as you listen to the tracks more and more. Not instantly exciting or groundbreakingly futuristic, it is definitely worth more than a few listens to understand the depth of each track. The deep, bassy strings lurk about like a shark beneath the surface, allowing a sense of fear and awe to drift about with out ever finally jumping out at you. Not Hybrid's best, but scores high on originality for a different approach to the strings/machines style that made them so famous."
4,Very decent electronica for an empty sci-fi morning,"This album takes me more into a darker and more mysterious side of hybrid after their ground-breaking album 'Wider Angle'. The title itself (Morning Sci-fi) is the adventure that each song takes you into. It starts off with a very mystifying intro as it brings you into 'True To Form' which, in my own opinion, is a hit song similar to the sounds of Staind or Disturbed. Other highlights include 'Visible Noise' and 'Know Your Enemy'. I am surprised, however, that this album didn't receive as much recognition as Wider Angle did *shrug*This is a MUST for Hybrid fan's. Thanks!"
3,The Rescue Company,"I would like to start by saying this is one of the worlds most missed RESCUE goroos.The book was a little basic, was anticipating more but was very good if you know nothing about the rescue end of the fire service. Rescue 2 the best."
3,The Rescue Company,Ray Downey is an encyclopeda of information about rescue/rescue operations. The book is somewhat elementary. It does not provide in depth discusion or instruction on any particular rescue operations. The most negative issue with this text are the poor quality images. This is a great text for Rescue 101.
2,Disappointing Recipes,"I bought this book in high hopes of stocking the freezer with healthy recipes. I found the recipes in this book to be disapointing and fatty. The dishes that are to be frozen are dishes that don't take that much time to cook anyway. Therefore, by thawing and heating them you are not saving much time. I also did the 2 week meal plan and found that it took far more time that 1 1/2 days to prepare. I think that it is harder to prepare these meals in a day and a half than it would be to do them nightly.I would have prefered a book that had healthier and more creative recipes. I usually love to cook and was trying to do something that would make my life easier when my newborn arrives in a few months. This cookbook did not live up to what I expected. Sorry for the bad review."
4,Good book to start with,"I have a couple of freezer/once-a-month recipe books and I like this one the best. It's a good ""starter"" book. The best thing is that it's a 3-ring bound, and has tabs for quick reference. The recipes are clear and easy to read, with instructions on freezing and serving. Includes a variety of recipes from breakfast and soups, to desserts. Also includes helpful charts.I've learned that you can make a freezer meal out of just about any recipe--so buy this book if you'd like to learn how to do it --then when you have down the general idea, go out and get your favorite recipe books and adjust the recipe directions as needed."
4,Same old recipes,"There is nothing wrong with the cook book in general. The concept of cooking once for a month takes discipline, the only downside I saw to the book is that it has boring recipes. Also, it's geared to cook many dishes of the same meat or vegetable family. So if you cook beef, it will be beef dish's for a month."
1,Lucie Arnaz Does Not Endorse This,"Stay away from this rehash of Lucy Anecdotes. It is totally inacurrate. Brochu adds nothing to the Lucy Legend here and makes a pest of himself in the process. Lucy Arnaz says in her website to ""skip this one""."
4,Immigrant Story,The story in this book relates to most immigrants. Being a minority helps better understand this authors' point of view and appreciate the sacrafices we all have to make in orther to compete for survival.
3,Better as you keep reading,"This book was reccommended to me by someone ""high up"" in Oxford Univesity Press. At first I thought it a bit Polilitcally Correct, typical good guys (the poor trodden down Colonials) the bad guys (whites-- namely the Brits and missionaries - who afterall taught them to read and write in English so they could write ""award winning best sellers""!) However, as I read on I found the charaters more interesting and more complex. You won't like any of them too much, but you will understand where they are coming from. This is engagingly done by retelling previous parts of the book as each charater experienced it. Some well done poignant parts. Worth a breeze through, at least. A little soap opera-""ish"" at the end."
2,Confusing,"A friend of mine suggested this book and all I can say is ""we must have different tastes"". It was very confusing. It jumped around a lot between characters and time periods. It was sad to see how the Jamacans were treated but not much different than the United States during the 60's. I had to make myself finish reading it and that is not what I am looking for in a book."
4,Great story but printed on cheap paper,This story had me laughing out loud at times. I love the characters that Andrea Levy has created and the stories kept me interested. My only disappointment is that this particular edition is printed on such cheap paper. I would have paid more to get the same beautiful presentation on better quality materials.
4,Good read,"I bought this book largely because I found it on some ""best books of the year"" list. Sometimes I hate award-winning novels. This was an exception. It's a good read. It's funny at times and thought-provoking. The book has a nice ending. I thought Hortense would know about Queenie's baby, but she never finds out. I like the irony of it. One small complaint though. I hate the pages! They hurt my fingers and were at times, difficult to turn since they stuck together. Cha! Nevertheless, I recommend this book."
2,Nothing Special,"Having never heard of the book nor the author I picked up Small Island because the cover looked good and the story sounded appealing. Having now read the book I was somewhat disappointed. The story was nothing new... the life of an immigrant in a new country, the trials and tribulations and the attempts to fit in to a culture that doesn't necessarily accept those who are different. The writing was not that exceptional. None of the characters really tugged at my heart strings because I didn't feel any attachment to them. If you're looking for a book to read, this one isn't bad, but there's just nothing that special about it."
2,I might be the only one in the UK but I did not enjoy this book,"Although the storyline was good in principle - Jamaicans coming to 1940' England expecting to find the promised land but crashing instead against a wall of prejudice and racism - I believe the huge potential that this theme carried was not fully exploited. Levy's style of writing is very neat and with peaks of originality, not to mention her dry humor which infuses the pages but, I am afraid, that is as far as this book went for me. I found it long-winded and boring, especially the 'before' parts, and I found myself rushing throught them to find out what would happen in the present days. Truth to be told, nothing much happens and my perseverance in getting to the end of the book was not even rewarded by a great finale. Sorry to go against such a strong current of support, but this book did not do it for me, and I was relieved to turn the last page."
5,"""Small Island"" - A ""good read""","I read this book as part of a book group choice. Memorable, well drawn characters, superb sense of time and place (post-war London)........an enjoyable book for many reasons."
5,small island - big book,Probably one of the best books I have ever read. I was a small child in London at the time this novel is set; reading it brought the memories flooding back. It is a very good account of how the immigrants from the Windward were treated but written with wry humour rather than bitterness. This makes it all the more shocking.Beautifully crafted - it just pulls you in and along with each different 'voice'. A very easy read it has great pathos and doesn't avoid any intimate aspect of these intertwining lives.I have given this book as a gift to several friends and family.It is deserving of the prizes it has won and I would also highly recommend another of her books: Never Far from Nowhere.
2,Very Hard To Follow,"I have a rule; if I'm not into a book after the first100 pages, I give up and pick up something else.Ms.Levy isn't a bad writer, there are really some paragraphs in "" Small Island"" that are quite good. The characters however just didn't move me. I didn't love or hate them and therefore, didn't feel an attachment.The plot is about Jamaicans in Jamaica and how they're treated after they moved to England. While Ms. Levy should be applauded for writing about this, she should also know that her story falls flat. At times the narrative was very hard to follow. Serious literature should be readable. If this were a movie I would have walked out after 20 minutes.Reviewed by:Erren KellyGeraudMahogany Media Review&#61652;Mahogany Book ClubAlbany, N.Y"
2,Not really my thing,"This was another book club book that I probably wouldn't have read otherwise. This one's about a West Indian couple who move to London after the First World War. Will they settle in? Will they experience racial hatred?Small Island has quickly become my girlfriend's favourite book, and I think she's been on the phone to the rest of her book club mates discussing it for the past week days non-stop because I can hardly get through to her now - either that or she's avoiding my calls!!I obviously didn't enjoy Nathasha's new favourite book as much as she did. But there were some interesting themes and a lot to think about the way our country has become racially divided.I hope the next book club book's a bit better..."
1,glad I pushed through,"I very much enjoyed this book and am hoping to read more from this author. I found the beginning a bit slow and at times I was tempted to give up on it -- but I plugged along and I am very glad that I did. Andrea Levy writes with such clarity and realism -- After I got into it, I didn't want to put it down. It is a book that made me laugh as well as shed some tears -- it also made me realize yet again -- how blessed I am."
5,Can it get any better than this?,"The answer, if you're a rail buff, a resounding NO!! The action, scenery, steam locos and just the right amount of brutality make this a superb film. If you're a rail fan, get off your thumbs and buy it. Now. You won't be sorry."
4,The Emperor Of The North,"If you like the oldies, you will like this movie. It is a drama centered in the days when indigent men traveled the rail lines across the states. Ernie Borgnine plays his usual bad guy and Lee Marvin is the hero, if you can call him that. Good story."
5,Great Depression Era Train Tale,"A movie for any fan of Ernest Borgnine, Lee Marvin or Trains. Set in the Great Depression of the late 20's - 30's. Borgnine portrays Shack, a conductor whose disregard for hobos is legendary. Lee Marvin as A Number One, is the quintessential rider of the rails, who is forced to deal with Shack and a young upstart ""bo"" played by Keith Carradine. A great story! Watch for the scene with the constable ""barking like a dog""!UPDATE:NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD, BETTER QUALITY"
1,"boring, horrible audio, not entertaining","Movie is not nearly as good as I had expected, after reading these other reviews. The voice audio doesn't even sound like it's part of the movie. And this is throughout the entire movie. Like they taped the voice audio at a completely different level than the rest of the sound. Very distracting. And the basic story is lame and not entertaining. Don't waste your money. It's not even worth a rainy sunday afternoon."
2,Hollywood has come a long way since '73,"Lousy acting (neither Marvin nor Borgnine had to stretch real far), the role of Carradine was superfluous at best, and it just kind of ended with no real point being made.Movie shows 2 days in the lives of some hobo's, and it's eluded to that relationship between Carradine and Marvin is of a much longer nature. Script needed some work!Granted, I caught this on cable, not the VHS release, and maybe some editing had taken place. The movie interested me, but left me wondering what the point was. I guess if your a serious railroad fan, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, pass."
1,Railroad tales,This CUDDA BEEN A CONTENDER but the foul language and hokey story left me no choice but to scrap this one. I love railroads and steam locomotives but the Hollywood proclivity to use such foul language leaves me cold.A looser for those who appreciate stories without the foul mouthed charactors who cannot speak without cursing. With the language Guardian on you get to hear about 2/3 of the film because the foulness is stripped. That says it all.Scrap it.
5,Best Train Movie Ever,"The Movie is awesome with it scenery and mood of the Great Depression. A No. 1 played by Lee Marvin is a hobo that can ride any train. the Shack played by Ernest Bourgnine is the rough and tough strong arm on the train. they mix it up and the hobos come up with creative ways of staying on the train when the ""Shack"" tries to kill them or knock them off the train. A true classic this movie is. I have been watching it for 20 years."
4,Emperor of the North,"Great movie. If you love adventure and trains, this one is for you. Shows how brutal the train conductor could be. Very good Depression era movie."
5,Emperor of the north,This is a great movie at an excellent price Lee marvin and Ernest Borgnine at their best! Its about a hobo (Lee Marvin)in 1933 depression era determined to ride a train run by a sadistic conductor (Ernest Borgnine)who would rather kill a man then let him ride his train for free. won't say any more to ruin your seeing this movie its the same movie that sells at the sacramento rail museum for $29.99 and on ebay for sometimes over $100.00 must say something if people are willing to pay thet much got mine from amazon for the very best price going you won't be disapointed
5,Emperor of the North,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, it takes place on trains, under trains, in rail yards, and in hobo jungles. It pits A#1 (Lee Marvin) vs The Shack (Ernest Borgenine) in one of the greatest battles of wit and brawn as they travel across the pacific northwest. No bo has ever ridden shacks rails and lived to tell the tale. But, A#1 is no ordinary Bo. He's The Emperor of the Norht Pole. This is one of the most original movies I have ever seen, and I've seen em all, one of the best for both Marvin and Borgenine and a young Keith Caridine. Buy this movie and you won't be let down."
5,Not just for Train Nuts!,I bought this for a Train Nut who's been looking for it on TV for the last few years. I finally broke down and went looking for in on the internet. To my surprise I enjoyed it also. The scenery was beautiful of course being the Northwest. I even liked the Hobo camps the train story. Ernest Borgine & Lee Marvin are great! This is a sleeper that all will enjoy!
3,Use for stretching,These tapes are for stretching and lengthing. They are not full routines but to learn modified postions and perhaps little things to do in the day.. for example shaking the kinks out of the arm...I use to watch Lilas on PBS... when she had her long braid her voice is gentle and she talks right through. For some this may be annoying but the upside of this would be that it allows for direction... meaning you will know how your body is suppose to feel. I am researching her other vidoes. I am looking for a complete class with several positions performed several times
2,Boring Yoga,"I agree with the first reviewer - this video gets quite old, and too slow to hold the viewer's concentration. I feel I quickly outgrew Lilias's definition of Beginner."
3,"It's not Whoopi's best, but it's still quite funny","I remember when this movie came out - on the tail of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"". People expected it to be as good as that, because Whoopi was the flavour of the month. It was a disappointment in some ways, yet contained some hilarious moments. Scenes include the female policewoman falling backwards after attempting to kick in Whoopi's front door. The best scene is when Whoopi, disguised as a home maid, breaks into the rich man's home and steals his goodies - and nearly gets caught.DVD EVALUATION: Warner have released this in Full Frame which is a disappointment. A Widescreen version is, of course, preferred by DVD fanatics! Sound is 2.0 Dolby Digital. No special features are included on the disc."
4,Distracting Fun,"While I agree that this is not Whoopi's best movie, it is blithe comic fun that's good for two hours or so of pleasant distraction. Whoopi's irreverent character, Bernie, is a reformed thief forced to do one last job to pay off a blackmailing cop. Along for the ride is the divine Lesley Ann Warren as a nutty dentist, Anne DeSalvo and John Goodman as two bumbling cops always a step behind, and Bobcat Goldthwait in what is probably his only tolerable performance.Tons of profanity, absurd plot twists, and an easily-descerned plot make for a fun farce that is guaranteed to make you laugh."
4,BURGLAR....,"Some reviewers like Leonard Maltin have one problem... They tend to over analyze some films. Especially Comedy films. Burglar was not made to be an award winning film. It's for one of those friday evenings after a stressed out week at work and all you want to do is put your feet up have a drink, and pop a tape into the vcr. Well in those situations Buglar is the perfect film to chose. It's about a theif (goldberg) that is just trying to cut clean and just run a used bookstore. But a Cop has evidence that will convict her and put her away for a long time. So he wants her to pay him off which send her into another spree of theft. But she witnesses a murder and everything points to her.... All Whoopie fans will enjoy it."
3,Not bad for a movie that's supposed to be about a Jewish Man,"I don't have anything against this movie -- it's a pleasant little romp. I just remember that I was sorely disappointed when it came out because I'm a fan of the series of books that it's based on. I suppose I should say ""loosely based on,"" because this doesn't even come close to the books. The books were written by Lawrence Block and featured an aging Jewish man named Bernie Rhodenbarr. Rumor has it that Bruce Willis bailed on the production, so it was given to Whoopi. Not a bad decision, I suppose. But not a good one, either. If you like harmless mystery/comedies from the decade of The Mullet, then you will enjoy this.By the way, the books are also available here at Amazon, so you ought to do yourself a favor and pick them up, too."
2,"Poor rehash of the ""bad guy wrongly accused"" formula","Whoopi Goldberg's usual likeability is absent in this half-hearted, critically slammed vechicle in which she is cast as a burglar who breaks into an apartment and to her surprise, the guy there gets killed by someone else. Guess who's accussed of the crime? The story has only a select few laughs (I don't agree with critics that Bobcat is a saving grace) plus it's also illogical and predictable. There were too many moments in which I felt that I should have laughed but didn't since like the film, the jokes here are nothing that we've never heard or seen before. Not to mention, the pace is way to slow."
1,PacTool International ss424 Backerboard Sheer,"Finally getting around to hanging the Hardi board siding on this job & was looking forward to dustless (as advertised) cutting. I tried every possible way to make these shears work, but every cut resulted in ""butchering"" the edge. I think I could of made better cuts with an axe! I've been building houses 60 yrs & can't do this kind of work & keep happy customers. I will be returning this product to Amazon & going back to my to my old dusty Skil-saw/hardi blade where I can make precise/clean cuts."
4,"Great, wish is came with screws","I bought this for a friend as a birthday gift. Great product, my friend loved it, just wish it came with screws."
1,They were all stuck together,They came in the middle of the summer and the packaging looked OK but had no protection from moisture and the jelly beans are a soggy mess. Do not purchase.
4,Good read!,"This period novel, originally published in German in 1926, gives a very interesting look at gay love set behind the gay underground in Berlin. The story tells of one lonely man's attraction to a boy prostitute. I found MacKay's passionate descriptions of gay love and attraction, at this period in history, to be beautifully written.Also interesting, from an historic point, are the descriptions of the gay underground of that time. He describes the bars, street boys, cruising tactics and other elements that catapult you back to the time."
3,The worlds oldest profession in pre-Nazi Berlin,"This novel was one of the influences on Christopher Isherwood which is why I read it. Other reviewers have given good summaries. The Hustlers in the book (Pupenjunge in German from pupen, to fart) concerns teen or adolescent hustlers sought by young adult or adult men. It is not about pedophilia which another reviewer mentioned, which would have concerned pre-pubescent boys, but about pederasty which concerns adolescent or teenage boy-men. The legal status of pederasty is solely related to the age of consent in a given legal domain. MacKay was a proponent for ""pederastic emancipation""."
4,A must first read if you're planning to venture into this exciting business,This book is an excellent resource. Marc Kramer does an excellent job from beginning to end. He explains the consulting business and the opportunities that exist. This book is a must read for anyone thinking about starting a consulting business and great tool for existing consultants to grow their current business.
2,Didn't really meet my expectation...,"There are only 3 songs that I really love on this cd. However, those 3 songs made it worth the purchase. The best thing to do is listen here on amazon before purchasing and judge for yourself."
2,loud shoes!,when i walk in these shoes they make a lot of noise maybe because of the leather! i have leather shoes but they dont sound like this! its embarrassing so i gave them away but my cousin wants to give them back go figure!
4,Good Access Point,I got this for the office to use as an access point. It's up and running and working relatively well. The PoE was included and is a nice addition to the package. The AP was easy to set up. I got it up and running manually in about 15 minutes with WPA security. The dual band a and g is very nice. When users feel sluggish on one band they can switch to the other. I've used it for about a month now and hasn't noticed any signal drops or connection drops. The only complaint I might have about the product is that it is bulky. It is clearly made to sit table top style and not mounted on the wall. All in all it's a good access point for the money.
3,Don't waste your money,"This overpriced Access Point's performance has been nothing but disapointing. I ended up purchasing a much cheaper Linksys Wireless G router that out-performs, wireless signal is more consistent, and is much easier to configure. Once setup, the D-Link wireless network signal would come and go, even at close ranges. The DHCP capabilities would work sometimes, and other times it would not. I would not waste money on this Access Point, which was four times as much in cost as the Cisco/Linksys Wireless G."
3,Steals your Attention,"TEES MAAR KHAN is another addition to the con caper list. It has some uproarious moments like the Bin khopdi ka bhoot track and Atish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna) constant desperation to bag an Oscar Award. But the digs taken at Aamir Khan, Manoj Bajpayee and Danny Denzongpa are certainly below the belt.Akshay Kumar plays his role well. But he has nothing new to offer as we have seen him playing several similar roles in the past. Katrina Kaif plays a wannabe actress to perfection and completely sizzles in Sheila ki Jawani. Akshaye Khanna is brilliant. It's actually good seeing him overact as his role demanded that. Raghu Ram and Rajiv Laxman don't have much to do. Salman Khan's guest appearance in Wallah re wallah is first-rate. Chunky Pandey is hilarious. Arya Babbar is decent. Ali Asgar is passable. All the other actors play their part well."
2,Just Ok,I was disappointed in this. The humor was too slap stick/over done to be really funny. I guess I like my humor just a bit less over the top. Good stars so I thought it would be better.
4,Up Periscope!,"A fresh approach to helping us keep our perspective and not loose focus, Terry Brewer provides valuable insights into ten key areas of life which can overwhelm us. Typically Terry, he uses real-life situations and combines practical advice with humor in order to help us understand and face the situation. Up Periscope! not only helps to remind you what is important but provides the steps to help regain and maintain your balance in life."
5,A Great Read,"I've seen Terry Brewer speak several times. He is a dynamic personality with a sincere concern for his audience and a real ability to empathize with their needs and problems. His book will allow those who have not had the opportunity to hear him speak to see what all the fuss is about.Using humor, clear language and clever references to popular culture, Brewer helps the reader to focus on what is important in life. He articulates how to maintain the proper perspective in a world filled with distractions and false agendas.I strongly recommend this book for both its informative and entertainment values. I also found it very funny. I can't wait to read his next book."
5,Why Get The Greatest Hits Disk? Its All Here,"If Your Like Me when you looked for a Toto Greatest Hits disk, you had to be dissapointed with the selection out there. but with this box set you get all the radio staples ""Rosanna"", ""Africa"", ""Hold The Line"", exc., also you get the great unreleased songs ""Lovers In The Night"", ""99"", ""We Made It"", ""Mama"". The only thing missing is ""I'll Be Over You"".Summation:If Your looking for a great start on a Toto collection, this box set will give you a great running start.Cons:Its missing ""I'll Be Over You"" which is my favorite Toto song, and if your just looking for the radio hits, its a little expensive."
3,Pretty funny,"I usually do not think most foreign comedies are funny (particulary Italian comedies), however, this movie is the exception. While involving a fairly serious subject (kidnapping) this movie was pretty funny. Ariadna Gil played it straight and was very good."
3,A masterpiece it's not but worth a look!,"As a big fan of Spanish Cinema and the Trueba Bothers (Fernando for Belle Epoque), I didn't want to give it only 3 stars. The setup was entertaining, the ending, thought-provoking. Problem I had was the middle. The story seems to deviate from the main character, Amanda Castro (Gil), and goes into some subplot about the deviante behavior of another character (Segura's). I found it to be repetative and boring. Did we really need to see Segura's charcacter pleasure himself in front of his father while watching a video of his mother or step-mother? Guess I found that act alone repulsive and didn't feel it added to the dynamics of the story.Gil, of course, is great as usual. She never ceases to surprise me. If for anything, watch it because of her. she does a good job of playing a washed out, drug infested actress."
5,bird stopper,The little buggers want to eat all of the tomatoes. just peck a hole then move on to the nexed opne. No more shareing
3,The Use of Netting,"I have found the netting quite useful, although; rather time consuming when applying to your trees. (Before Netting) Every year I would have birds eating almost all of the fruit on my trees but now they have been almost stopped in thier bird tracks! Only a few fruits get eaten by the birds...the ones close to the surface of the netting that are plainly visible and easy to reach from a close lying branch. I would recommend this netting if you have a problem with bird population around your area, or if you're like me, always having migratory birds stop for a quick little refreshment at the ""local diner"" a.k.a. your place, on thier way back home."
5,Pure Joy in Early Country Rock,"I think this was my favorite album in the early 70s. It revealed the writing genius of Kenny Loggins and the production mastery of Jim Messina. It also included one of the best country-rock-jazz fusion bands of the time. It was an FM gold mine that finally caught on with the AM croud. Much good has been born from this album... Loggin's impressive career, Messina's ongoing demonstration of production and writing skill, Michael Omartian's piano and production genius.... Get this album. It is one of the GIANTs of the early 70s and one that should be very much alive today."
1,Box Set Not Available,I have waited for 2 months for this item to be shipped. Now they tell me it is not available. This item is still advertised. Don't bother ordering. Disappointed. U Bet. Take it off the web site. Although I need to put at least one star it really is a negitive number(-5).
3,"Great Book, Mediocre Diagrams","As usual, another great book by Yang Jwing Ming, co-written by masters Liang, and Wu Wen-Ching. Useful historical background, and in-depth translation of the poems and songs, with clear interpritation of each. This section of the book alone is worth the cover price.My only quarrel is with the diagrams. The photographs are black and white, with a dark background. The directional arrows are pitch black, and can be almost indiscernible against the background, causing quite a bit of confusion. The text provided for the diagrams saves that particular section of the book from being completely confusing."
5,The Best,Absolutely THE BEST book (AND DVD) on the market on the subject of Emei style Baguazhang. I study under Mr. Wen-Ching Wu at The Way of The Dragon in Rhode Island and believe me he knows exactly what he is doing when it comes to Chinese Martial Arts. I rate this book a BEST BUY if you are interested in Baguazhang!!!!!!!
1,BAD! BAD! BAD!,"Anyone who likes this album knows nothing about music, life, who they are, and must not have any friends. Listen to the record and get in touch with yourself unless your afraid to look into the mirror. Wait, you don't have time to listen to it, it is time to go see Star Wars for the 900th time."
1,I thought I had heard the worst.....then came this.....,"Wow! How can you people who gave this album 5 stars live with yourselves? Fans of good music beware! Here's a good analogy for you, Meat Loaf is to good music, as cigarettes are to good health. Horrendous lyrics and detestable music abound in this travesty of an album. There may just be hope for you Meat Loaf lovers yet, but you must hurry! Rush down to your local music store and purchase a copy of Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn! It's your only hope! Quickly, while there's still time!"
1,"Same Old, Same Old","After one of the worst albums in music history, ""Bat Out of Hell"" became an inexplicable hit in 1978, Meat Loaf's career promptly headed south and straight into the toilet. For fifteen years his was a has-been, and the butt of jokes. All this changed when he essentially re-recorded the album, gave it an equally insipid cover, and topped off this bout of originality by giving it the oh so clever title ""Bat Out of Hell II."" The result? Another inexplicable hit of bad, overwrought songs with bombastic production and screeching vocals.After the dust settled, Meat Loaf's career promptly headed into the toilet once again and as a result one can no doubt assume that ""Bat Out of Hell III"" is just around the corner."
5,"If you don't own this, you are WRONG!","This is one of the best epic rock albums ever... right up next to his other great performances. Amazing music, drive, emotion, and imagery unparalleled by just about any other artist out there. Absolutely amazing!Side note: Read his epic autobiography too... I'm a sci-fi and fantasy fan, but reading his story was amazing as I had a rough past too. Nice to see someone else overcome the odds in real life! :-)"
3,Hmmmm.....,"I absolutely LOVED ""Life is a lemon....."" so I went and ordered the CD, but the songs aren't that great. A bit cheesy, but Rock and Roll Dreams was well....cute. :)I don't regret getting this CD just for Life is a Lemon."
2,"Meat is fair, but a far cry from the original ""Bat""","I have had this album for a long while and it still confuses and irritates me. What Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman tried to do on this record is over-intensify the effect and update the sound of the original. Let's face it, there is no other album of his that can compare to 1977's ""Bat Out Of Hell"". The songs are long, perhaps too long, and the production goes overboard. ""Wasted Youth"" is a waste itself, meaningless and a very small cry for ""ROCK AND ROLL"", sounds like he was imitating a Jim Morrison-esque type of poem in a pointless opera. Fair."
5,The best Meat Loaf CD of all time,"Damn. I was blown away when I heard this CD!!! I'd Do Anything for Love is one of the best songs ever written. All types of emotions are caught on this CD. From hating your life, to falling in love and things going from bad to worse, this CD has at least one song people can relate to. GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!"
4,Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman Rule Again,"I have to really do a better review later because right now emotion overcomes me and writer's block sets in, subsequently. However, I have to say that I must have been in a coma in the 70's and early 80's not to have discovered Meat Loaf until now. The CD ""Bat Out Of Hell 11 (2)"" is absolutely great and I wish I could expound on the individual songs. Meat's voice is winsome, the lyrics are awesome."
3,Recycled Steinman,"Bat Out of Hell II is basically the album that Steinman and Meatloaf would have made had they not fallen out after their original collaboration. Most of the tunes appeared on Steinman's solo effort Bad for Good, which makes this basically a re-recording of that effort, or if you would rather, the album that should have been made in the first place. Either way it sounds dated and while Meatloaf is in fine voice, it's a shame that instrument couldn't be put to better use. Still it's a fun little CD, and if you liked the first one there's really no reason you won't like this one."
3,Best since Bat 1 and the best since bat II.,This album is great and the second best Meat Loaf album ever to this day. Everything after Bat Out Of Hell 1 up to but not including Bat II is garbage. Everything after Bat II has been garbage including the new Bat III and Hang cool.
5,great album,"I'm 15 now, and when i was about 6 my dad used to play this album on tape in the car a lot. Although i couldn't really grasp what any of it was about (not that it's especially complex), I've always loved it. Sure, it's pretty corny and ok, it's sung by an ex-fat guy, but every song on this album is fantastic. Years later, after my dad passed away and you and now download music via the internet, this album is still as significant to me as it was nearly 10 years ago."
3,Eh,"I wish I didn't have to buy the entire album for just the one song; I only wanted the extended version of ""I would do anything for love"""
2,You get what you pay for,The CD and case look like they were used as a hockey puck. The case is cracked and to say the CD is scratched is an understatement. The condition advertised was very good. If this is very good the poor must have been used for target pratice.
2,Interesting,"Like it's similarly titles predecessor, this one seems to inspire utter hate or complete devotion. I've always found that interesting about both album as neither one seem to inspire either extreme in me. I've heard better, I've heard worse."
5,This is good music,The FIRST rock ablum I ever owned that I could listen to all the way without skipping a single track. Jim Steinman is the coolest. He is a great songwriter. Meatloaf is the only one worthy enough to sing these classics... Need I say more?
1,Edited & Censored don't bother unless you really need to see it,"After the incredibly painful download of this unbox player, the Video is the G rated version, edited & censored, same as on basic cable. All the nudity is blurred out, all the language bleeped, etc... you'd think it would be the unedited version since your paying for it... but no.If you want to see the G rated version of the show, then it's good but, sorry it's aggravating to pay for something and have it censored.Amazon should have cleared stated ""Edited for Basic Cable Version""."
2,WHACK... WHACK... WHACK... WHACK... if you like lots and lots of,"spankings then this is the book for you. I didn't realize so much of the entire book was dedicated to the blow by blow descriptions of so many spankings. I will give it high marks for at least having an entertaining plot but it lacked depth, realism and true character development. But then again do any of these books really ever do that. No wonder Ann Rice is so appreciated."
4,Another good one from Denise,Denise Hall has a way of making the characters real. The story line has been a strong fantasy of mine. She did it justice.
1,DID NOTHING!,I used this product EXACTLY as instructed and it did NOTHING plus it tastes awful. I am extremely disappointed
4,the best of the best perfumes,"This extrordinary book covers the most impacting fragrances on both the public and the industry. From conception to development to launches, it gives a thorough history of these wonderscents.Each chapter is a spesific scent, covering the designer, the fragrance creators, the bottle development and all the dirty little secrets of how they got to the top. The book thoroughly covers 45 perfumes (I think he missed a few) including greats like Chanel #5, Shalimar,Anais Anais and Angel. Mr. Edwards also gives a composition rundown, But this is a little confusing if you are not familliar with his Fragrance Manual. Required reading for any fragrance nut."
3,Not as good as I expected,I thought it was a ready-for-use hand-book. But it's not. Too many words to read. You have to be patient when you go through it. Not fit for a busy person like me.
5,Fantastic book,This is an articulate and well researched review of an icon in architectural history. Merkel weaves his professional and personal journey in a manner which is pleasure to read.
4,Beautifully illustrated book,"Though I would have liked to see more insight into his design process, this was a beautiful overview of his work, which is surprising by its diversity and scope. His work is intelligent and playful."
4,Great for Teddy lovers,The bears featured in this book are cute and not difficult to knit. I've made several and enjoy them all.
5,"Dedicated Book for knitted Bears!,","I love this book.Who can resist these lovely hand-made bears?! They are realy something whoever receives it as gift will treasure them forever. I know I will.These knitted bears are so cute that I can not make up my mind which one to start. I read the book over and over, flip the pictures again and again. OK, I may start with ""Sleepy Sam"", or "" Ralph"", or "" Christopher & Rosie"", or ...A must book for someone who loves crafts and bears!"
5,If only I had more time,The bears in this book are unbelievably adorable. I can't wait to get started on making some! The instructions are very well written and easy to understand.
5,Cutest teddy bear patters,"I love every single pattern in this book! The bears are all so cute. mostly knit with size 1, 2, or 3 needles,so you have to like small projects (well, I guess you could use a bigger needle and bigger yarn and just make a bigger bear)"
4,Lots of fun!,"I found the instructions pretty to work with. One thing that confused me at first in the instructions to finish each piece was cast off and I finally figured that that had to mean bind off. I have only made one little bear so far but I will be making one for each neice. The pictures are just heartwarming and you just want one of each bear to cuddle. This book is better for intermediate knitters than beginners although with a little help and direction, a beginner should not be afraid to try something new. The pieces work up pretty quickly and in my opinion, sewing the parts together is the mose tedious and time consuming. Especially if that is your least favorite part like it is mine."
5,Heirloom quality bears,I was very pleased with this book. The instructions are good and being a beginner I did not have any problems following the patterns. These bears go above and beyond your normal knitted toys. They are heirlooms to be passed on for generations. Another great book to add to my crafting library!
3,Mediocre,I didn't really notice any difference in these compared to my ac delco's. I have a 2007 silverado 1500 5.3l.
5,"""The Wildcatter"" Strikes Black Gold!","Harris capture's the success, levity, and struggle Robert O. Anderson needed to cluge together a global oil conglomerate masterfully--this book is a winner and needs to be studied by students of business interested in learning how to assemble a successful business team. Anderson is rightly portrayed as both a child of privilege and a blue-collar go-getter determined to make his mark in the oil industry. Though Anderson could have obtained admirable results solely invested in the stock market during the corresponding period, he seemed uninterested in a sedimentary lifestyle that inherently was his for the taking. Rather Harris makes it quite clear that Robert O. Anderson was a dynamic hands-on leader far more passionate about creating and unifying a splintered industry. Perfect for reading during a flight from NY to LA to comprehend the effort required to consolidate the same geographical area under a single oil company. Well done indeed, 5-Star rating!"
1,What a Waste of Time!,"Well, sorry but this story [is disappointing]. Espescially for anyone who enjoyed the story and idea of Sleeping Beauty. And its not even that the story is that bad. The writing [is no good]. The reader is constantly confused, and even when you've finished the book, you might go ""huh?"" I hated it. I do not suggest that anyone buy this book."
2,It's cynical.,"On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest rating I could give, I rate this book a 7. It's hard to stay with. The writing is not bad, but the approach is cynical. Actually, it gives me a feeling that the author does not really like females, and is taking out his aggression on the fair sex by these writings. I could do without being so much in the prince's ""head"", or the evil fairy's ""head"" - especially before bedtime. Nobody wants a rotting princess full of worms, either. What ever happened to the other fairies? They aren't here. I can't read this book before I go to sleep. It's not a soothing experience. It's dark; but some people like that kind of thing. I don't find it to be an erotic book in any sense of the word - it is more aggressive than feeling. In fact? the prince does everything short of squatting in front of a mirror to comb his hair back like ""The Fonz"" from Happy Days, before meeting the princess. ""Aaaayyy!"" (Gee, I think I would take THE FONZ over this prince, any day!)"
1,One Bad Book,"For a short book, fewer than 100 pages, it is one long, bad, boring read. Save yourself; don't read it if you don't have to."
1,Disappointing,"Very difficult to get at ties on this rack. Pull off one from the middle and others comae along for the ride. I tried this for two weeks, then sent it to a local church sale!"
4,The Crow...in the palm of your hand!,"I got this purely because I am obsessive over toys. Having this Goth demigod on my mantle just brings an aching joy to my collection instincts as it sits side by side with the likes of Superman, Freddy Krueger, and Darth Maul. I know, I am such a dork."
4,Outstanding history reference of the balkan wars,"This book provides an overwhelming amount of information regarding many of the abuses of power in the balkans that have not been reported in the mainstream press. It clearly demonstrates the truth to the old saying ""People who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it."" This is very true in the Balkans and Bosko Vukcevich provides the data. There is so much data that one can get overwhelmed, but the book is orgainized in the latter half as a collection of short essays with a clear topical headline. Anyone who wants to understand the real roots to the current problems in the balkans should have a copy of this book."
2,2 stars for the Orbital score & some nice visuals,"I saw this on cable but it was called Octane not Pulse. I guess they changed the name for the USA release. Overall this movie is a mess. The story is incomprehensible, but it has to do with a highway cult that kills people & drinks their blood, but none of this is ever explained, its just an excuse to have flashy music video cinematography & a cool techno soundtrack by Orbital. This is a nice little rental or catch on cable if you have nothing to do on a rainy day but definitely not worth buying."
1,If only...,"If only David Lynch or Christopher Nolan had gotten their hands on this scenario,they would probably have made a ***** movie out of this.Unfortunately , as it is , the movie has an unfinished and incomplete character and puts solid acting performances by Mischa Barton and especially Madeleine Stowe to waste.Hurried editing does not arrange the overall frustrating picture.Try again!"
4,Don't Be Too Critical,"Also called Octane. Not widely known & it gets a bad wrap, but it's a good film if you take it for what it is & appreciate its weirdness. It's mysterious, eerie, realistic, gives a feeling of isolation, and the soundtrack matches to perfection. Jonathan Rhys Meyers once again flaunts his skills as a stunning villain, it's worth it just to watch him in action. A little blood & violence, nice acting, good ending."
1,STOWE AWAY,"First question: why is the talented Madeleine Stowe is this negligible piece of cinematic garbage? A paycheck's a paycheck I assume.This is another one of those purportedly psychological thrillers that allows screenwriters to throw together some ideas and dare the audience to figure out what's going on.A vampire cult of some kind has taken a young woman under their wings, spiriting her away from her distraught mother. Teen angst is a thematic element but the teens are so immature, you can only wish they all get zapped. The movie ultimately makes no sense and serves up one of those ambiguous endings so popular in movies these days. A real bummer here, folks."
2,this movie has barely a Pulse....very faint...almost gone,"Pulse stars Madeleine Stowe (Unlawful Entry, Avenging Angelo), Norman Reedus (Blade 2, Gossip, Boondock Saints), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (upcoming Elvis, Alexander, Velvet Goldmine), Mischa Barton (Tv's The O.C., Lost and Delirious) and Bijou Phillips (Bully, Black & White). Stowe and daughter Barton are on the road...they have a typical daughter/mother spat and Barton winds up being taken away by a group of people, led by bad boy Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Stowe then goes on a hunt for her daughter. Along the way she encounters a strange towtruck man, played by Norman Reedus. So, Stowe goes off on a rampage to get her daughter back from her kidnappers. Not much pulse in this movie...its faint and can barely feel it. Some good direction, mixed in with a pyshco performance by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers keeps it at bay."
1,What the ?,"I went into this movie hoping for a trippy psychological thriller. Instead I got confused and bored, which was very disappointing because I liked the actors in the movie. The story is unclear and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is wasted! They never fully explain much of anything, so I recommend you watch paint dry instead."
3,Ask this question: Who are your translators?!,Why compare Shimada to Murakami? I'll tell you why: its all you've got to go on! I agree with the other reviewers that this is not the best of what Shimada has written. The reason that its in English is b/c it was a prize-winner. The translators go by what sells as well as their own interests and Dream Messenger obviously hasn't sold or there'd be more of Shimada's novels translated. He's (Shimada) a much more important novelist though... Why are there only two books by Nakagami Kenji translated? Same reason.Sometimes I just wish Murakami would just go write in English! That's where his primary audience is. But maybe that's just his ultimate parody.
3,just fine,my boys thought it was a cool thing to wear since all the baseball players are wearing them on TV.
5,Three of the best.,"When Johnny Winter hooked up with Muddy in the late 70's he coaxed him into playing some of the finest music of his illustrious career. The first of the three recordings, Hard Again, got it's title from Muddy exclaiming ""..this sounds so good it makes my little peepus hard again."" All of this music presents a genius of the blues in his 60's playing with the power of a man half his age. It's timeless, it's brilliant and the band is more than up to the task. This collection should be in any self respecting blues fan's collection. Pick up the equally(if not more so) terrific live album titled, Muddy ""Mississipi"" Waters Live (also on Blue Sky) add the Muddy Waters Chess Box Set and you are all set. Muddy was it...Simon"
3,Susan Bassnett,"This is a great book for those who have read several theory books and authors as: Cicero, Dryden, Nida, Baker, Snell-Hornby... Otherwise you will not understand anything, like I did or didn't... Too much information crammed together, to many names and numbers for my taste."
5,War Eagle,"For those die-hard Auburn Tiger fans, this is a great addition to your Skybox (especially if your spouse is a Bama fan)! Easy to install and looks great."
4,Highland 35036 Black Universal Car Roof Top Basket Carrier,This carrier fits my 1999 RAV4 like a glove and does it's job very well.
1,Shoddy construction,"I used a very similar car roof carrier 15 yrs ago on a cross country trip from the west coast to the east coast with great success. Unfortunately I gave it away thinking I would never use it again. I found I needed a roof top carrier for a move from the North to South this year, and was pleased to find a very similar item as I had previously used. Well it was not the same product at all.I wasn't even 1 hr into my trip when a fully loaded carrier flew from the top of my roof bounced and scraped across the trunk hood (of a new car) and landed in the middle of the highway. The carrier was in pieces (all my possesseions in the carrier were intact as I do know how to use these carriers) The feet had broken off, the straps appeared to have been sawed threw. Shoddy construction and unsafe! I do not recommend this carrier."
2,So So,I purchased this rack to use on a Scion xa; it won't work on this car. It also wont work on a Chrysler Concord or a 87 Continental Mark 7. The packaging suggests it will fit most cars but you can't prove it by me as I have yet to find a car that it will work with. The rack sits fine on the roof but on all of the newer vehicles I've tried it on there is no place to fasten the straps. I suggest that you advertise it as fitting SOME cars and research thoroughly before buying.
3,Highland Roof top carrier,"Highland 35036 Black Universal Car Roof Top Basket Carrier is a good product. Comes out real handy when you don't have enough room in your car trunk. Very light and easy to mount on the rood of the car.The only disadvantage is that it can be easly stollen if left in the public parking places. Over all I am satisfied with this product.Gayas AhmedBrimingham, AL"
3,misfit,"The item itself is fine. However, it was supposed to fit our vehicle and we are challenged with making that work. It could be operator's error though."
1,Not as good as it looks,We purchased this product through Cequent Consumers Products (Walmart) the actual make of the basket is very light - as a woman I could easily lift this over the car and place it on. But the straps are pieces of garbage - if you purchase this be prepared to buy new straps before using.We put this on our car - and less than 30 miles into our 1400 mile trip - the whole thing came off the car - damaged it and took a chunk out of the roof panel. The straps were woren through and then ripped apart with the force of the wind on the carrier.I have used rooftop carriers in the past 20 years and NEVER had one fly off.Contacted Cequent - never heard anything back - poor customer service and poor product.
3,GOOD PRODUCT,My only problem where the hooks on the straps didn hold on to the doori had to put a ratchit strap to hold the basket
4,Highland Car Roof Top Carrier,"for the price, this roof rack is well worth it. i wish my car had the right kind of doors, so i wouldn't have to use other ways to secure it to my roof, since it will leak a bit if it rains. if you have the right kind of doors on your car, you would rate this a five star. i went from an suv to a smaller car, so on roadtrips, i needed some extra storage. I fit 2 large rubbermaid containers and secured them on the roof rack for my storage containers. there was a bit of wind resistance felt at times, but that would be with anything you put on your roof. the rubber feet did no damage at all to my roof. i even have a sun roof and was able to position the rack so it did not sit directly on the glass. it was easy to put together, too."
2,"Maybe worthy price, but not great","Very good price is partially compensated by two problems:- foot pads cannot be moved, which might imply loading weight in less structurally rigid areas of car's roof- belt hooks are fairly small and don't hold well to gutterless carsIf I could afford a better one and/or use it more often, I'd go for a better offer."
5,Incredible Film!!!,"This is one of the best documentaries I've seen! I watched it the night the film premiered in Los Angeles; I recommend to my family but they couldn't watch since they live on the East Coast. If you're reading this review PBS, please make sure to air this documentary on ALL OF YOUR AFFILIATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY!!!"
5,Replacement plate,"I had broken one of the new plates that I was given and figured that I would try amazon to find a replacement one. And low and behold you had the exact one that I needed. Thank you so, so, so much!!!! My sister-in-law will never need to know that I broke one of them and had to replace it. You are lifesavers!!!! I will definetly shop here again, thanks and have a great day!!"
5,perfect plate,These plates are exactly what we were looking for. They feel as though they will stand the test of time. The color is what you see.
5,Bravo!,"This is the finest cobalt dinnerware that was ever supped upon! I bought a set of these plates for friends on their wedding registry, and they are very much enjoying the plates."
5,Instruments make this work interesting,"This seems to be a regular renaissance choral work, but Huelgas Ensemble has done it in a way that the work becomes far more interesting; they use different renaissance instruments for the different parts of the work, describing the different moods of the passion story. Instruments as recorders, viols, cornetts and sackbuts can be heard. Not only the instrumental part is good; the Huelgas Ensembles' singers are all extremely good and do master the genre. This Ensemble are probably one of the most gifted in the world. I can strongly recommend this, and also other recordings by Huelgas Ensemble and Paul van Nevel."
2,X-Rated Lake Wobegon,"I was looking forward to the homey, innocent stories so familiar to G.K. fans, but he must have thought that, by injecting soft porn in the guise of the main character's sophmoric interests, this would be a nice bit of ""shock value"". Well, this is one reader who thinks that it simply didn't work! ""Coming of age"" novels don't always have to be so explicite. I'll stick with the ""old"" G.K. works and his great radio monologues."
3,Funny and Startling at the Same Time,"I really enjoy Garrison Keillor's writing, and this book is no exception. What I enjoyed most were his moments of enlightenment. For example, when he realized his father didn't like to be around people crying because he was afraid he'd cry himself, I got a real sense of this boy growing up. His ability to perceive things going on around him, yet not letting these things get to him in a negative way, prove he is a true writer in the making in that Summer of 1956. In addition, Garrison's character development is superb. As a reader, you get a real sense of what these people are really like. In some ways, you wish you could know the characters...then again, maybe not...hehehe. The startling aspect of this book is the amount of sexual content, but alas, this is a teenage boy we're referring to, so I took it as a reflection of the character himself, not as an attempt to shock. All in all, it's a good read. Not excellent, but definitely entertaining."
1,what's going on with Keillor,"What happened to the great Keillor that I was hoping to get when I picked this up? The book is ""about"" a teenage boy, but the overt... in this book makes me wonder if he wrote it FOR teenage boys. I couldn't even finish it, made it halfway through it then dumped it. Yuck!Did his publisher tell him to ""spice it up"" next time? Seriously, before you invest in this read some excerpts. Next time he introduces a new book, I'm going to thumb through it first.In the past I always felt comfortable recommending Keillor to friends, family, the man on the street..... not anymore.I've been a longtime lover of Wobegon antics, and this is awful. FYI I'm only 33 and I found this book pointless as well as tasteless."
1,Yuck,"while there were instances of humor, mostly the book seemed rather gross. If Garrison's goal was to get into the mind of a sexually obsessed 13 year old (the main character seemed younger than 14 to me), perhaps he achieved success. I was unpleasantly surprised. It seemed overworked: it certainly was an effort to read it. At least I bought it on sale. If you are new to Garrison's work, please, read anything else he has written!"
2,Read his other books,"As usual, Garrison Keillor is a good storyteller. But all his years on the radio must have caused a lot of vulgar, adolescent humor to get bottled up inside, since he can't say it on the air. And he finally found an outlet for it, he put it all in this book. So if you're a fan of ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" and don't mind the crude humor, this book might be for you. Otherwise, his other Lake Wobegon books are much better."
2,lake wobegpm summer 1956,"Disappointing. Someone recommended At Home it Mitford, which I finished before beginning Keillor's latest book. Although I am a great fan of Keillor's short stories and We are Still Married, this one doesn't compare. Why all the sex talk--I, for one, am not interested in what makes him go! Mitford was so sweet and well-written- much better written. I'd recommend it rather than this last Wobegon book. Sorry! I'll reread the old books about Lake Wobegon. I didn't like K's last novel either. He's better with short stories about others."
1,If This Is A Novel Then Where's The Story?,"Apparently Keillor has been writing so long that he thinks a bunch of bathroom humor and the crude sexual thoughts of a 14-year-old boy can hold our interest for almost 300 pages just because it has his name on the cover. Perhaps there was a deadline to meet or Keillor needed the advance for his sex therapy. The book is obviously autobiographical since the main main character is named Gary, a wannabe writer growing up in Minnesota. It's too bad, since Keillor at his best is capable of clever, intellectual and thoughtful work that can keep a fan spellbound. If this is Lake Wobegon then where are all the characters and situations that readers and radio listeners have come to love or at least cherish for all their familiar foibles? Or maybe like a lot of formerly brilliant writers, he's now a runaway train in need of a good editor."
3,He's written better...but this is still good,"Without question, Keillor is one of our best ""journalistic"" literateurs. But this effort is a little thin in places. Too mawkish in parts. But read it, anyway. He's a national treasure."
3,Humor and Nostalgia,"I laughed out loud at some of the humor in ""Lake Wobegon Summer 1956,"" particularly an episode involving the school principal. (I sopped up two tissues just wiping up the tears, I laughed so hard.) The humor is this book's finest feature and the main reason to read it. The storyline is swell, but nothing spectacular though Keillor does have a point to make - smalltown attitudes stiffle individualism, creativity and freedom of thought.The main character, a boy named ""Gary"" who likens himself to a toad, is a gifted natural storyteller. He seems clearly based on the author himself, so if you like Garrison Keillor you should enjoy ""Lake Wobegon Summer 1956."""
1,Needs a PG-17 Rating!,"Please be warned: If you enjoyed family style listening to Keillor's older feel-good radio-style vinettes of Lake Wobegon, such as ""Faith"", ""Rhubarb,"" and the like, DON'T play this for the family without reviewing it first. You are in for a suprise.Garrison has made off-color jokes in his monologues to a degree before, but not to this degree, freely talking about erections and much more here.And if he's not talking about the sexual awakings of boyhood, it seems he's giving a backhand jab to the ""Sanctified Brethren.""I tried, I really tried to pass over those parts (as I was listening to it on CD,) but they came so frequently, I just had to turn it off and leave it alone.Hopefully, Keillor will unburden himself in this CD, and get back to the family-oriented wholesomeness that I had come to love him for."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I've purchased Keillor's audio tapes for years. I haven't listened to the show lately and maybe I should. In the past I've found Keillor to be funny, poignant and nostalgic. This book, obviously autobiographical to some degree, is none of the above. It was not only a waste of money but a waste of time."
2,Is This Lake Wobegon?,"Since when do all the Lake Wobegon husbands cheat on their wives and teenage lust is transformed to unnecessary pornography. The writing is nice but the story weak and uneven. It's no wonder this book got panned in the press. And it's a shame since Keillor is wonderful at rendering nostalgia, human quirks and frailties in a way that is so comforting and yet makes us laugh at ourselves. I have the sneaking suspicion that Keillor's editors just publish whatever he writes rather than make useful suggestions regarding plot and tone."
5,"It's NOT a Lake Wobegon book, and that's not a BAD thing.","One of Garrison's best, and most personal. The Lake Wobegon setting is unimportant. Other than The Whippets having a pivotal role in the story, the familiar names and places of Lake Wobegon are minor players. This is a wonderful coming-of-age story, often funny, often uncomfortable. Gary, the 14-year-old narrator, shares the angst that ALL typical boys of 14 go through, as well as a very unique angst of being a young teenager in a strict religious household and a less-than-popular kid.Of course it's full of fart jokes and sex...he's fourteen, for cryin' out loud! Leave them out, and you don't have an honest portrait!If you're expecting warm, fuzzy stories of how great small-town life is, steer clear. If you're not afraid of being a little uncomfortable as a 14-year-old is frank about everything that goes through his mind (and I mean EVERYTHING), then you'll enjoy this."
3,AMUSING BUT RATHER BORING,"""Lake Wobegon:Summer 1956"" did contain a share of laughs and amusing moments, but overall, the book failed to hold my interest. It cound best be described as ""Woe, be gone!"" The book is filled with sexual fantasies and dreams of exuberant youth, but the adolescent fantasies soon became tiring and mundane. The reader keeps hoping a plot of more substance will unfold but, alas, it does not. The scenario almost seems like an attempt to reproduce the theme of a terrific older book, ""Summer of 42"", but Keillor's book lacks the strong setting, characters, intrigue, and raw, sentimental emotion found in ""Summer of 42"".""Summer 1956"" makes for a quick, light-hearted read, but it is probably not a book that will stand the test of time. Read it, if you will, but do not expect to find anything memorable among the pages."
2,Good concept -- but ultimately disappointing,"Sorry! This should have been a great book. Started with an interesting concept and characters, but did not deliver the goods. Lack of plot. Just meandered around Lake Wobegon and didn't really succeed in holding my interest."
1,Absolutely BORING!!!!,"This book is DEFINITELY NOT one of Garrison Keillors best. This book rambles on and on and was sooooooo boring I almost quit reading it many times! I've read and loved all of his other books but this was a big dissapointment. Save your money and spend it on another of his books. I decided to complete the book only to say that I read the whole, entire, boring piece and about the only good thing in the book was the ending! Hopefully GK will come out with something that is more Lake Wobegon again soon. I was disappointed, but will read more books of his in the future I'm sure."
2,Uneven -- not GK's best.,"This was a real disappointment. I've enjoyed Keillor's other books, as well as PHC, but this book was uneven and just not engaging. There didn't seem to be a discernable plot and it was a struggle to get through the book without losing interest entirely. I recommend you skip this book and read one of his other gems."
2,Whatever happened to continuity?,"As a longtime book reviewer at a midwestern newspaper I have read (and reviewed) much of Keillor's work. It's wise for Keillor to write about Lake Wobegon a.k.a. small town America with all the requisite quirkiness, nostalgia, etc. That's what his audience wants and expects. However, he should also be respectful of this promise. Suddenly LW is populated with husbands who constantly cheat on their wives and girlfriends, and his charming and lyrical pages have become filled with unnecessary pornography. I imagine Keillor's work floats through a publishing house relatively untouched, and that's fine as far as his wonderful prose goes, but a brave editor should have helped him sharpen the storyline to offer more reader satisfaction and to maintain LW continuity. Despite landing on the bestseller list, this book received mostly bad reviews (""USA TODAY,"" ""The New York Times"") and I believe these two things would have saved it."
4,Lake Wobegon: Summer 1956,"Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 reminds me of when i was young garys' age. All he has on his mind is girls, naked girls. He gets dirty magazines and reads them fantasizing about himself and his cousin Kate. Gary has an older sister that notices Gary reading his magazine, steals it from him, then uses to get him right where she wants him. She can do anything and everything and Gary must follow to stop the magazine from getting to his mother. After reading his magazines he writes his own little stories about his manhood and Kate. This book inspires me to read more of Keillors books because i can connect to Garys way of thinking and acting seeing as I remember them days as if it was yesturday."
5,Just As Funny As Ever,Get a grip. This isn't a children's book--it was written for adults. It is well written and just as entertaining as all the previous Keillor books.
5,That Summer you got a little older,"This is an outstanding book. Mr. Keillor is a wordsmith to be admired and paints a masterpiece with his command of the language. Upon finishing this book, I sat and deciphered its meaning. I knew I felt sad for Gary but I didn't know why. Then I figured it out; Gary had grown-up a little in the summer of 1956. I longed for the simplicity of childhood and wonder why when we are kids, we want to grow up so fast. Mr. Keillor's book gives us a peek into lifes little events and make you realize that, like it or not, ""grown-up happens""."
4,Lake Booger Summer 1956,"Garrision ( Gary?) Keillor like Stephen King,hasn't forgotten what it was like to be young in a small townand ""different""... Misbegotten English teachersand traitorous sisters who steal your girly book!Boogers and farts and constipation... dirty wordsand evil rock and roll are all of a time that endures.Swing / big Band is to rock and rollas rock and roll is to hip hop and rap?Music isn't valued for how it sounds alone, but how itmakes parents act?"
3,Cute book.,"Cute, somewhat heartwarming, somewhat funny. OK to read if you don't have anything better around."
3,Once Too Often to the Well,"First off: I think Garrison Keillor is a (minor) national treasure. That being said, this offering is his weakest to date. Advertised as a coming of age novel, it doesn't work for me. The characters are likable certainly, and the plot is mildly amusing; but, missing for me is the ""ah ha"" moment that I've found in his other books. I'm probably four or five years younger than the lead character (and grew up in a small California town as opposed to Lake Woebegone), but my ""coming of age"" memories are of the sixties with their concommitmant music, upbeat tempo and divisive social issues. Not the slow, turgid feel of this book. Maybe its just the difference of a few years, but I was disappointed."
4,A Journey Back Home,"Garrison Keillor delivers yet another home run with his trip down memory lane to fictional Lake Wobegon. Chock full of boyhood angst, baseball, religion, flatulence jokes and sexual fixation, Keillor elicits memories from his flock of loyal readers and creates a pseudo-memoir that stirs echoes of Bill Bryson's Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and David James Duncan's The Brothers K. High praise for this author and much deserved. If you're a man (especially one who grew up pecking away at his own Underwood) between the ages of 30 and 60, Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 is a 'must read'. I can't recommend it enough.Salmon Run"
2,tinny music,This recording was tinny and paced a shade too fast. The mastering and/or the transferring of data from the old recordings to this one was faulty. I was very disappointed.
5,Love this huge flamingo,I love this guy. All 25 inches of him. Mine is a male but yours can be female. I have an Alice In Wonderland outfit and I got this flamingo to carrywhen wearing this outfit. I also got a hedgehog. If you know the Alice In Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass you will know this was when Aliceplayed crochet with the Queen of Hearts and they used flamingos for the mallet and a rolled hedgehog for the ball. This 25 inch bird is the perfect size.It is well made and very huggable but if a kid is way young you may have to be concerned about the eyes and other small parts. Love this huge flamingo.
3,sounds nice but dissappointing and boring,"Right from the first notes I could tell this was going to be a mellow performance. This is a wild piece of music, but Chailly's approach is too comfortable. The tempos in all moevments are very slow. The first movement lacks the struggle and drama needed in this music. The trumpet fanfare in the fourth is too low and lacks impact. The ladies are no great shakes in the singing department. The last movement is far too slow with little of the drama we hear in Meta/Vienna or Ozawa's new recording. The finale climax is OK but the organ is toned down. Overall, a boring performance with nice sound. Very dissappointing. Stick with the above mentioned ones or Klemperer or Blomstedt. Chailly lacks the intensity for this work."
3,gone but not forgotten,"Dead on the cusp of success in 1974, Croce has long been remembered for catchy blue collar songs about car washes, big bad bullies and messing around with Jim. But it was his moving ballad Time in a Bottle, released shortly after his death, which galvanized listeners the world over. All those hits and more are included in this greatest hits accompaniment to VH1's posthumous biography of the late great singer/songwriter. It's an honourable overview, perfect for those who only know Croce's biggest songs. Folk influences like Gordon Lightfoot and James Taylor come through loud and clear, but Croce was always more the cigar-chomping steel worker sketching colourful singalongs in language aimed squarely at the average Joe. These are 18 timeless tunes, yet another example of an extraordinary musician whose legacy was cut tragically short."
3,Amateurish Animation,"I ordered this because not only am I a huge Poe fan, I am writing my thesis about Poe and visual culture. This film views like an amateur final project for an animation course. That being said, it is probably a great success for the filmmaker for whom this was practically a sole enterprise. I am not sure if it was worth the $20, but I am always happy to support a fellow artist. A 3 star rating is perhaps a little generous, but to be fair, I wasn't expecting 5 star quality. If you're a Poe nut and want to see a nice little fan homage to Poe, give it a go, but if you are looking for a decent film adaptation of Poe's work, check out Roger Corman's films."
1,Nothing New,"The book was disappointing. I've read a ton of them, and this one just had a catchy title. It was bland and dull with nothing new to entice you into taking your vitamins for the soul. Of course, if you're about l3 and have never read anything of this nature, it would be fine."
4,Exercise Mat without handles,"I've used this mat for 3/wk workouts which involve core exercises (planks, crunches, leg lifts, etc). It is sufficiently sturdy and thick to buffer a 240 lbs man from a tile floor. It is not a thin yoga mat. I wish it had handles as it can be awkward when carrying into the workout room with a water bottle, towel, etc. But I like it and would buy it again as the quality is good and I think it'll last a long time."
5,Classic Space Opera,"The Helmsman is a great start to an excellent series of books that revolve around the main character, Wilf Brim, and his adventures in space. While the basic story line, lowly peon advances to fame and riches while gaining love of beauteous princess, is predictable it is done with a style and class that make the reader ignore that aspect. Also, the gritty reality and attention to details help to make Wilf Brim's universe real in the readers mind. Overall this book is an outstanding read alone or beginning to a series.If I had to make a complaint about this book I would have to say that the author does not give enough information on Wilf's background. While there are repeated references to his past and his family there is never any detail given. While this is not a terrible thing, flash backs can sometimes be annoying, the author references back to them too much to leave unexplained."
4,Lenny gives it his all,If you like the effect rather than the analysis of music Lenny Bernstein (and currently James Levine) can bring an energy to music that few others can. I have several different audio and DVD recordings of the Requiem but Bernstein's is the most captivating and wrings the most out of the huge orchestral and choral resources at his disposal. A 'must add' to any collection
3,Don't limit yourself,"This is a great book if you are seasoned Sendmail admin with good C programming skills. I give 3 starts because it is so hard to understand.I've been using sendmail for 3 years and I just tried Qmail and Postfix. I have chosen Postfix because it's so darn efficiant and configurable.Viktor Duchovni, is a great help on the online community and the online docs are just as detaild as this sendmail book.If you are stuck on sendmail then get this book.But try Qmail and Postfix if you can...BTW... RedHat lets you choose between Postfix or Sendmail. That means a lot to me."
2,This is more like a reference manual,"This book probably covers most information regarding Sendmail but is not meant for someone trying to learn how to configure sendmail. Most chapters have a small introduction and then go on to explain each feature/aspect in detail. For a beginner, it is difficult to connect the dots (features) and understand how to configure / run sendmail."
4,'SEND' YOUR 'MAIL' WITH SOME COMFORT,"This versatile well-illustrated book is detailed enough as to take the place of a reference text. It has kept pace with all the evolving versions of the software (up to the 8.12 edition). A whole chapter on Spam and Anti-Spam has been added to this latest edition. Other new additions include elaborated chapter on Performance Tuning; as well as expanded coverage of Vacation and Makemap. Every new option as regards the software (version 8.10 through 8.12) was included. At the same time, the simplistic outlook of the book remained unchanged. This is a good text to own, although that some of its details are really unnecessary."
5,Let Bashovia Wash Ovia,"The music defies description. How do you explain a peyote trip, for example? From the liner notes inside by John Fahey himself ""The mood is neither Oriental nor Occidental, male nor female, human nor alien, young nor old, live nor dead, traditional nor contemporary, hip nor unhip, yin nor yang, apples nor oranges, plus nor minus, electric nor accoustic.."". Bashovia is unadulterated bliss. I haven't heard anything like it before."
5,So Beautiful!,"The Leonard Maltin review is pretty much on-the-money: ""Dreams"" is beautiful, but it really drags. We're used to films that speed us along to an exciting, satisfying climax (or at least that's what they aspire to). ""Dreams"" is a different kind of film altogether. It is art, and it is absolutely, breathtakingly beautiful. Kurosawa often captures the feeling of a dream - that strange fluidity and pensiveness is there. Turn off your expectations and let this film wash over you. The images will stay with you forever, as will the stories. Nevertheless: I, for one, am waiting for the price to come down a lot before I buy my own copy."
4,Childhood Dreams,"Interestingly, my 3 year old daught and 4 year old son are totally mesmerized by Kurosawa's ""Dreams."" They like to watch it repeatedly, and it has opened up some truly neat discussions on mysticism, war & peace, beauty & art.We are a multi-cultural family (Mom is LA Woman originating in El Salvador, Dad is nurse-anthropologist from an IA farm, traveling to our home in Northern California via China).I love watching this and puzzling through the layers of meaning and symbolism. Thanks."
5,One of the best foreign films ever...,"This has to be one of the best foreign films that I have ever seen in my life. Kurosawa made a magical film that will stay with me forever. I will never forget ""Sunshine Through the Rain"" or ""Crows"". I loved these two the most. Some of it is almost Lynchian in the way that dream logic is used, but of course, this IS a film about dreams so that is to be expected. Martin Scorsese even has a cameo where he plays Vincent Van Gogh, and he's not all that bad. All in all, I loved this film.I will be adding it to my collection very soon.HIGHLY recommended!"
5,One of the greatest films ever!,"This is one of the most stunning, hypnotic films ever made. His themes of Life, Death, and Rebirth are great mythic creations of the 20th century, already classical wonders. Each time I see this film I am stunned by its beauty, transported to the ""dream"" state of Mr. Kurosawa. This film begs for DVD format as the music and special effects are hypnotic and profound and would be that much more entrancing. Any word on the likelihood of its release on DVD?"
5,New wave of Post-modern fim-making,One of the most insightful looks into the mind of one of 20th century's greatest film makers. Perhaps this is the definitive movie of this time period that others in the future will try to emulate
1,"5 star movie, 1 star for the lack of DVD","This review crits the lack of a DVD version of this movie.DVD and digital projectors blow away both TV and HDTV. After using a digital projector w/DVD player, and seeing super high-res picture on a 4x8' screen in my living room, there's no way I can go back to VHS and TV.So where's the DVD for one of my favorite movies? They can transfer everything of Kurosawa's except this masterpiece? Let's get with the program.-- JJ"
2,Pontificating trumps storytelling sublety,"This anthology of short films by the great director Akira Kurosawa based on his dreams reveals a deep concern for the relationship between man and nature. As one would expect, there are many extraordinary visuals on display here. The first vignette, in which a young boy enters the forest on a rainy day in the hope of witnessing a wedding of foxes, begins the film beautifully. It is startling, mysterious, and fearsome; the boy can be seen as a representative of all mankind, intruding thoughtlessly on the natural world without care for the consequences...and unprepared for those consequences when they come. Unfortunately, while the quality of the visuals remains high, the stories become increasingly preachy and obvious as the film wears on. Only one, concerning a group of mountain explorers that has lost the base camp, approaches the quality of that stunning first episode."
3,Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,"You have to appreciate having a unique perspective to enjoy this movie. I always remembered the title as being A.K. Strange Dreams, because they are just that. Some leave you smiling and others leave you oddly displaced by their turn of events. You are left to interpret your own ""moral of the story"" and regardless of the unusual role play, the vividness of imagery and imagination he creates is worth watching. I recognized the pattern of each dream growing from childhood to old age, and likened it to the progression of life itself, in spite of the ""strange"" circumstances that come our way."
3,Not for the average bear,Saw this video more than 20 years ago in a theater. It was so remarkable that I forgot that I had seen it until actually watching the 6 vingettes. I do like more traditional stories -- not artsy fartsy presentations. The tape was in good condition and arrived in a timely fashion.
2,yawn,guess my attention span isn't sufficient to appreciate this.long waits for any action.the visuals are stunning at intervals and are worth the priceof admission.
2,Dreams,"I have nothing but respect for director Akira Kurasawa. The only Japanese director I know by name. Like every other movie of his that I have seen, this is Japanese with English subtitles. Eight interrelated stories for a total of two hours. I watched two stories. 30 minutes, or 1/4 of this film. Still bored, I gave up. His use of the colors of nature was positively breathtaking, but I just got bored. Every color of the rainbow, I suppose, since the cover plus what little dialogue I read leads me to believe that's a unifying theme. I also read on the jacket what this film ""is about,"" and I'm with him. But, well, I didn't watch it. I may have just been in the wrong mood."
5,beautiful imagination on display,"Akira Kurosawa was well past his prime when he made this wonderful film and it makes the work of most young hotshot Hollywood guys look soulless. The movie ""Dreams"" depicts a series of ""dreams"", each as I recall it totally separate, non-related to the next and its own little world. And each one I found myself fully immersed in. I could detail each one, but I would recommend you watch it with no preconceptions, no ideas. Go into it with an empty mind is best.Master of ""digital baroque nerdism"" the one and only cgi-director George Lucas may have cursed audiences with a few cinematic abominations during the decades following the Star Wars trilogy but he at least appreciated Kurosawa along with his master of the blockbuster buddy Spielberg. So kudos to them for helping with their fortunes bring this project about. Come to think of it, this movie here might very well be the best movie George Lucas has been involved with since the original Star Wars movies."
3,It's 1.85:1.,"I just examined a 35mm print, and can confirm that fellow reviewer P.A.G. Fessel and the IMDB have wrong information about the aspect ratio. This film was composed for the 1.85:1 ratio, and that is the way it was shown theatrically. I have submitted a correction to the IMDB.Not one of Kurosawa's best in my opinion, anyway. Still often quite fascinating."
2,"Beautiful, tedious, and preachy","If a picture is worth a thousand words, why bother filming the anti-nuke diatribes in the sixth and seventh dreams? To be clear, I agree with the sentiments, but I found this preaching, not dramatizing. I found Scorsese's van Gogh annoying, particularly in his speaking in English when the rest of the dream was in French. And I found the pace glacial (pun intended, regarding ""The Blizzard""). The cinematography is terrific, but steer clear, especially if you find long shots with little to no action boring."
2,Second Childhood,A silly inept movie made by Kurosawa in his dotage. The only people who go gaga over this one are people who haven't seen Kurosawa's best work. Or maybe people who don't know what real movies are. Go see 7 Samurai or Ran before you see this one.
4,Fascinating Tidbits,"This book is a fascinating compendium of all sorts of pieces of information about Biblical people, places, and things. Where was Adam when Eve ate the forbidden fruit? What book of the Bible contains the most questions of any book in the Bible? What does it mean to ""pray without ceasing?"" Did Delilah cut Samson's hair? Is healing from sickness included in the atonement of Christ?While some of the author's answers to some of the above questions are controversial, he is not afraid to broach these subjects and many, many more. Everyone will learn something they didn't know about the Bible from this book."
1,Murach's ASP.NET 4,"If this is not a required text for a course, I would never have gotten it. Chapters are unnecessarily long. Sentence structures are complex and far from to the point. I understand that this is a technical book, but does it has to be that boring? I would recommend Beginning ASP.NET 4 in C# and VB from Wrox for all whose are learning ASP.NET."
1,Is this a STORY book?,"This book is written in a NON-PROFESSIONAL/NON-TECHNICAL manner. It is like an OPINION-based story book. The use of the word ""I"" on a technical book is very DISTURBING the author described majority of the procedures in this book in the first-person point of view instead of third-person.The use first-person makes it look like it is an OPINION rather than a factual statement. Moreover, this book is not peer-reviewed so its credibility is questionable.Suggestions for the next edition:-Use third-person point of view-Provide concise and numbered step-by-step format for all procedures-Avoid contractions-Maintain a logical flow of information.-Avoid huge blocks of text with no breaks-Use proper APA or MLA writing style-Attach figure and graphic labels directly under them and not on a different part of the page"
4,Great book!,"This is a great book that'll help you hit the ground running. Sort of falls short on really specific things when it comes to writing code for maintaining a database. Gives the reader a quick overview of the key parts of the language, but not much else.It helps to have a few years experience of Visual Studio under the belt. I don't think I'd recommend this for beginners. It mainly deals with 4 languages at once. Html, ASP, C# and SQL. I've had experience with SQL, HTML, and C# previously. And PHP which is almost the same as ASP.Perfect for refreshing after you know about the language/programming style already. Excellent reference book, with code examples and explanation of the code side by side."
5,Highly recommended,"I have read many ASP.NET books but this is so far the only one that have real meat inside. The first 3 chapters alone is well enough to get you started to create your own ASP.NET application. I advise readers of this book to learn C# first to get the most out of it.This is the first Murach series that I have read and with this outstanding quality, I will most likely look into their other books."
2,No what I had thought,"The pearl was great! However, the silk cord is too hard to get on and is not big enough for an adult to wear"
4,Cultured pearl & peridot drop pendantt,"Cord is darker than shown, but otherwise satisfied - very dainty and good buy for the price. Am satisfied with purchase and service."
4,Very worthwhile....,"Very worthwhile... sounds a bit left-handed in that it appears to lack enthusiasm. Well, this is not grand opera, nor does it pretend to be and it IS very worthwhile. Aside from a verismo plot which at times seems a bit complicated (hey! it's opera), there are some pretty good tunes. Not everyone is up to the job of singing, in particular Sergio Panajia who is the Milio Dufresne and tenore numero uno and should be better than he is. Moving on, the liner notes by someone named Piero Mioli, are excellent and add much to the understanding and enjoyment of the opera. I would very much like to see a video, but I'm sure that's not going to happen. The best production is the one that's $100 - I'm not going there."
2,Over rated,"I bought this on strength of very favorable review in nov/dec 2008 Technology Review by Mark Williams. He said Budrys was a major SF writer who had been seriously overlooked but ""showed that the genre can produce literary art."" I strongly disagree with this judgement. There are many fine SF writers, CJ Cherry being at the top of my list. I found the earlier book, Michaelmas, badly written and was unable to finish it. Who? is better but hardly qualifies Budrys as major figure. He has been properly forgotten.Norman Kurland"
4,Doo Wop 51,If you have some Doo Wop already this is a useful recording but it suffers from the usual 'live' issues when you remember the studio recording! Also suffers from a common problem that some tracks are not what I would call Doo Wop. Overall a good listen though.
3,Missing 14 Songs,"I have the DVD of the show (5 stars!!) and wanted to get a CD. Unfortunately, the CD only has 20 of the 34 songs. If the CD had all the songs, I would buy it.This applies to the Doo Wop 50 CD (only 20 of 38 songs).Too bad Rhino didn't issue a 2 CD set with all the performances."
2,is this the best from 51,"This cd is not what I expected from the show that I saw Doo-Wop 51.I thought this was supposed to be the best from the doo-wop eraIts not. The only good ballad on the cd is from the Dubs( Please dont ask me to be lonely) the rest of the stuf on the cd is average that you would hear on any oldies station not the good, rare, ballads that you cant hear on the air waves. It is OK but not enough ballads from the PBS show. SORRY !!!!!!!"
4,"Nice package, but not the required box set","Someday there will be a proper box set of Cyndi Lauper material. In the meantime, this ""three-fer"" will suffice for most listeners. It features the two 80s releases that most of her fans know and love--plus an early 90s recording (""Hat Full of Stars"") which deserves to be heard.And of course, the price is right. But the lack of inclusion of anything from ""Night to Remember"" is disappointing. The rock-crit establishment has spread the word that Cyndi's third release is a one-star affair. In reality, it's a vocal tour de force, which leaned on the pop side (which I guess in some corners is anathema) but was a perfectly valid step for someone who considered herself first and foremost a singer.The ideal box set would also pick up some of b-sides of her singles (""Heading for the Moon"" would be a must, but also ""Cold""), live tracks and yes, of course, ""The Goonies."" That'd be good enough for me."
5,missing songs,"I also have a request for ""Goonies R' Good Enough"", but does anyone remember ""I've Got A Whole In My Heart (That Goes All The Way To China)"" from the extremely rare Vibes soundtrack? It might be fun to hear the theme song to ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"" also. I hope that Cyndi comes out with an even better boxset that includes those songs. This stuff is really good though."
4,A Pretty Good Sequel!!!,"This is a good sequel with a lot of action and comedy! It's been two years since the original and Axel comes back to Beverly Hills because someone shoots Captain Andrew Bogomil. He is still alive, but Axel, Billy, and Taggart figure out who is behind the Alphabet crimes and stop the person who shot the Captain. I highly recommend BEVERLY HILLS COP II!!!"
3,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" is back in business for sequel","Detriot cop Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to once again show ""square"" cops Rosewood and Taggert how real police work is done. This time, they're after a group of bank robbers known as ""The Alphabet Bandits"" who are responsible for shooting their boss. While this one is more dedicated to action than comedy (thanks to Top Gun director Tony Scott), Murphy is still in rare comedic form and manages to keep this sequel from being a waste of time. Too bad the same can't be said for the third entry in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise. Number two is a bit of a rehash but seeing all the characters from the fist go-around (with the exception of Bronson Pinchot and Lisa Eilbacher) back in action makes it excuseable."
3,The Bep Reviews Beverly Hills Cop 2,"the first beverly hills cop movie was a classic, the second one however isn't quite as great. this movie does pack it's fair share of laughs and action but it seems to not have the same style as the first one as well as not having a fresh storyline. it seems to start in the same way as bhc 1, with one of axel's friends getting either hurt or killed and then axel goes to beverly hills to find the killer. after a while though you forgot about the revenger part and get caught up in a whole new storyline and the movie gets better but still doesn't live up to the original."
4,One Great Sequel,EDDIE MURPHY SHINES AGAIN IN THE 2ND INSTALLMENT OF THE BEVERLY HILLS COP TRILLOGY THE FILMS THAT MADE HIM A SUPERSTAR OF THE80'S. AXEL FOLEY THE SMARTMOUTH FAST TALKING DETROIT COP ISAGAIN IN BEVERLY HILLS INVESTIGATING A STRING OF PROFESSINALROBBERIES THAT IS SOMEWHAT INVOLVED THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OFFOLEY'S FRIEND POLICE CHIEF BOGOMILL. THIS FILM IS MORE FASTPACE AND HAS A LOT OF ACTION TO PLEASE ANY ACTION FAN. DIRECTORTONY SCOTT KEEPS THE ACTION & LAUGHS COMING AT A RAPID RATE.BUT SOMEHOW THE ORIGINAL BEVERLY HILLS COP HAD MORE GENNUINE STYLE.
4,"Not quite as good as the first, but still worth it.","It's hard to repeat the same magic over again, and perhaps this film best states that. Tony Scott directs this time around and while he made this one flashier and more action-packed than its predecessor, he doesn't quite handle it as well as Martin Brest did. Still, Eddie Murphy is funny as ever and delivers many memorable performances. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are also onboard and are in fine form. To sum it all up, the performances are great (with Paul Reiser having a larger role than before) and the visual style is WOW. But the plot is very thin this time around and the film drags towards the end. It doesn't hold a candle to the first one, but stands alright on its own. Just watch and enjoy."
3,Axel Foley's second go round,"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills to take on thugs after his police captain friend Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) is shot and wounded. Flashy sequel is never boring but there are several problems: Murphy is loud and obnoxious, timid by the book cop Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is now a gun freak who never questions authority, and Bogomil is seen at the beginning of the film happily chatting with Foley about a fishing trip, despite the fact that he ran Foley out of town at the conclusion of the previous film. The action sequences are pretty overkill and come off as exhausting rather than exhilarating. The ""Alphabet Bandit"" scenario is pretty cartoonish. Mindless entertainment but this was 1987's top grosser, so you decide."
5,Beverly Hills Cop II,"Eddie Murphy is incredible! This movie is more like what Hollywood should be producing now! This is good, clean humor, with action, suspense and just plain fun!"
3,Style Over Substance,This is a good to fair movie. Eddie murphy reprises his role as Axel Foley a cop who busts drug users. The story to this movie is thin and is a typical sequel. The movie still did well at the box office grossing 153 Million dollars but not as good as the original in 1984. This movie looks more appealing than it has substance to it. If you're looking for a movie on a rainy day rent this one but don't expect to much from it.
5,Briliant!,This movie is a hilarious sequal to the great first one.I'm just waiting for it to come on DVD it's definetly good enough for it.
2,Poor sequel,"The film seems to have been made by fans of Part One who tried to repeat what was fun, engaging, and exciting about the first, but could only manage heavy-handed effects, smirking in-jokes, and crude characterization. There's nothing close to the shoot-out at the Beverly Hills mansion at the end of One, but I give it two stars for the chase scene using a cement mixer (don't remember seeing that kind of film-mayhem before). As stunning as Big Birgit was back then, she's dull compared to the malevolent Steven Berkoff."
4,Beverly Hills Cop II,"Beverly Hills Cop II~ Eddie Murphy is a good movie for a sequel. However, it is not as well done as the first movie. The music is downright awful. The fashion is even worst, and the script is not as well-written as the first movie. Still Eddie Murphy, is doing a great role as Axel Foley. Bridget Nielsen is awesome as the villain. I miss the chick that played Alex's sidekick. Still and all do not get the idea that I think that this is a bad movie by any means. It is just not as good as the first one. The again Beverly Hills Cop part one is one of the best cop/comedy movies of all time. I defefinitly give it 4 out of 5 stars."
5,Appetizer,Enojoyed this cd very much. Really giving you a taste of what Eric ROberson has to offer for an eargasm for ones ears. Would order form this seller again.
3,"OK, but still better than most!","It's not as good as I thought it would be, but an OK Eric Roberson CD is still better than the BEST CD from most of these clowns out today!If I didn't already have the song, it would have been worth the money just to have ""Just a Dream"" in my collection. Beautiful song!"
3,Interesting Discussion of Script Evolution,"This book's thesis is that the Greek alphabet was adapted by a single person in order to record Homer. While the idea is interesting, the evidence certainly is not definitive. I found the author's arguments unconvincing and hard to follow. However, the book is a good resource for old inscriptions, including some sexually explicit grafitti. The book also provides a good history of the early Greek alphabet and the the Cypriot syllabary."
2,watch the language,"I enjoyed the CD for the most part but was particularly dismayed when track 3 came on and the profanities emerged. Of course, it gets edited on the radio so it was only while playing it in my truck that I became informed as to its content. While I feel she is talented, with the ego to match, I feel the profanity is beneath her and urge all who are NOT shopping for offensive language to pass on this one."
3,J.Ho should stick to acting,"Jennifer Lopez entered the music biz in mid-1999 by releasing ""On The 6"" which was a sturdy start for her debut release. I'll admit, I purchased this album and didn't think it was half bad. In actually, I only bought it for pictures, but the music wasn't too corny to bump in tha ride. Now, it's 2001 and Lopez has released her repetitive and utterly annoying sophomore joint, ""J.Lo"". With the same uninspired attempts to dig through her Latin roots which she never really had since she was born in the Bronx and speaks choppy and slurred Spanish. JLo's standout track would have to be the 1st single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" with heartfelt as well as angry lyrics w/ an up-tempo beat. Other than that, if you're into bubble-gum pop and meaningless lyrics w/ put-together-in-5-minutes beats, this is YOUR album."
2,Perhaps this should have been delayed...,"Perhaps this release should have been delayed after the demise of her relationship with Puffy. There is way too much Puffy influence in this album and it brings the whole thing down.I'm not a big ""Bubblegum"" Pop fan, but I liked Lopez's ""On The Six"" album. I was anticipating this album as I looked forward to her second release, and I have to admit, it's disappointing. I didn't expect it to be the same as ""On The Six"", but many of these songs, while a scant few are catchy and are destined for massive radio overplay, the rest are very poor."
1,Way Loooooooooo,"I heard this album online though her own listening party. I expected alot more since I do like ""Love don't cost a thing"", and I liked her first album. On the 6 is better, I liked her ballad with Marc Anthony and her jam with Big Pun. I didn't like any other songs on this new cd, her new album is crap. So generic. Download the songs off napster if you have to before you buy it, trust me. Try before you buy. This is a perfect example of why Napster is needed."
2,Give the girl some credit,"JLO I must admit may not have the best type of vocals for the music in her latest cd, but one must admit that her singing isn't all that bad. I do believe though, with more pratice in strengthening her vocals, she might just come back next time with a more powerful voice. She carries her tunes well. Unfortunetly, I only liked the single (#1 on the cd), the rest basically sound the same and that harp music at the beginning is a bit too much. There's one thing I am not in favor of. I bought my 10-yr old the cd. Never in my dreams did I think JLO would stoop to say this in one of the songs: ""play my mother f-cken song"". She has a huge impact with the younger listening audience, minus ONE. I've refused to let my kid listen to JLO. Kids are very impressionable, and there's nothing worse then hearing your kid chant, ""Mother f_cken""..."
4,"I got what I expected, and enjoyed it","I bought Jennifer's debut CD, and liked it very much. My only problem was that I felt like there were repetitive Spanish songs on the album, which are not my taste. On ""J.Lo"", it is the same deal. ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"", ""Play"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""Walking on Sunshine"", and ""I'm Real"" are all really great songs, but the album seems to go downhill from there. I thought it was worth a buy, and people who enjoyed her last album will like this one as much."
1,Skip this CD,I am being nice when I rate this CD one star. I only like one song. Most of the songs just didn't flow. She tries too hard to be hip. I guess I'm on a different wavelength.Save your money and listen to J.Lo on the radio.
2,j.lo oh no,"J.Lo is ok... In fact it barley passes for Ok. Jennifer cannot sing, the production is sloppy, and the lyrics are cheezy except for a few. The only tracks that stand out here are: the very shakeable ""love don't cost a thing"", ""I'm real"", and ""walking on sunshine."" The ballads are a mess and the album is a bit too long (15 tracks)... or maybe it just seems long 'cause there are so many ""throw-aways"" here."
3,J.Lo,"This album can not be compared to On The Six which was MUCH better. My favorite song is I'm Real which sounds like Feelin' So Good. Parents, if you're planning on buying this for your young children and you care about bad language, in the song Play Ms. Lopez decides that screaming out the ""F"" word would be a good thing to do. I think this is a disgrace considering that many of her fans are children. This CD is great if you're a huge J.Lo fan. My favorite songs are Play (despite the little explicit outburst), I'm Real, Ain't It Funny, Come Over, We Gotta Talk, That's Not Me, and I'm Gonna Be Alright."
3,Retro-Latin-Pop,"J. Lo is certainly a reminiscence of the 80's Pop with a Latin influence in the background, it sounds like Madonna mixed with some latin balad and a touch of Chayanne.This album cannot be compared with ""On the 6"" so you'll be dissapointed if you're looking for the same style of R&B-Hip-Hop sound.In my opinion these two are the best songs of the album Secretly and Love don't cost a thing."
3,A fine piece of ......,"A fine piece of music..Oopps, I did it again. What I meant to say was, a fine piece of ass. And the music is pretty good too, but one has to know your best attributes and with Ms. J.Lo, those are in her back side.. The music keeps with the times, and doesn't go off in any tangents as you can tell how much $ went into its production. Problem is - I don't remember any of the songs and I just listened to the album five minutes ago. And it's not the drugs mahhn...I just wish Ms. J.lo will record ""Shake Ya Ass"" on her next album. Talk about the DVD sales on that one. I'd buy that for a dollar."
4,Pretty good follow up album,"I enjoyed this album..It was a bit different than n the 6, but I felt Jennifer was trying to sound a little too much like Destiny's Child on a few tracks. I could tell the big Puff Daddy influence, but it works. Loved the salsa beat.."
4,Go J-Lo,"I've read reviews from Jennifer's first album and now for this one and only a few are good reviews well J-lo here's a good one. I think Jennifer Lopez's has a wonderful talent and a even better voice ""Love don't cost a thing"" is one of my favorite songs ""Carino"" is a hot latin infulenced song. The whole album rocks. Get J-lo you won't be disappointed"
4,Bling-Bling!!!,"What can I say, but ""Bling-Bling""! Jennifer Lopez' new album is a virtual melting pot of R&B, latin, techno, and dance. With Jennifer's new persona as ""Puff"" Daddy's love interest, I expected the album to be focused more on Hip-Hop and R&B. I was pleasantly surprised to hear songs with different rhythms and vocals. What impressed me most, was the way her voice sounds more polished than before. She comes across as being a true vocalist, separating herself from a mere cross-over artist. Jennifer will be able to by all the hair extensions she wants, with the success of this album."
1,Terrible. Enough to deflate even J.Lo's gigantic ego.,"Lopez is a testament to the fact that good looks and talented producers are enough to make a recording artist succesful. Although i don't believe she qualifies as an artist. Before bad-mouthing people like madonna, pherhaps Lopez needed to ask herself wether she actually had talent of her own. The song Play proves she doesn't. Hearing her squeaky irritating voice whine over uninspired computer generated beats is about as much fun as listening to screeching tires all day. Avoid."
3,Sounds Like The Rest Of Them,"Too much dubbing on this one, to cover a bad voice? I don't know..but she sounds like the rest of them..Christina, Brittany etc...there's really no originality here..I will give a thumbs up on the remix of I'M REAL..I have to say, when I heard that song, I didn't know it was her, I really liked the song a catchy beat..a pretty song. When I found out it was Jennifer, I was amazed!"
1,Full of ...,"To Any parent: DON""T LET YOUR KID GET THIS! This is the worse album i've heard in my life, full of unwarranted explicitvies, J.Lo has ruined her carreer on this cd. Love Don't Cost A THing is about the only thing worth buying on this album."
2,No Whtiney Houston,"I have to admit I like Love Don't Cost a Thing but after that, it went downhill. Her CD is just...BAD! I gave this CD two stars instead of one because I pity this CD."
2,soul baring - like her Grammy's dress,"J-lo lacks of soul, though her vocal improved (i suspect engineers heavily filtered her nasal). It has a few catchy R&B tracks such as 'Love Don't Cost A Thing' and 'I'm Real'. 'Secretly' sounds like a song better sung by Janet Jackson, and 'Walking on Sunshine' needs heavier bass to accentuate the song. Don't expect a fun rhythm of her debut's 'Feel So Good', Latin romancing 'No me ames', club beating 'Waiting for Tonight'. But then, a real artist won't want to do the same thing twice (or more), she deserves a credit for accepting vocal-challenging songs and another for her cutting-edge appearance."
1,Piece of Crap!,"This is arguably a piece of crap masquerading as music. Lopez's voice was awful and sounds infantile. Unlike her debut effort, there's not one catchy tune in this collection. And what's the deal with the Puerto Rican accent??? She definitely needs to take voice lessons or just stick to acting."
3,"Weak voice, but great (catchy) songs and producers","I really like the producing of the songs on this album. However, Lopez's voice is not strong enough to carry certain parts in certain songs. I realize that this is what ""technology"" is for. Still, again, she is mediocre at best, and there are many more talented ""musicians"" who do deserve the spotlight such as Shakira. I don't think Lopez will have many more albums. She should have stayed with acting."
3,IFFY,"This CD is alright. but when I first head it Im like OK whats with her trying to curse n' stuff she should do her own music. But I love the song ""Im Real"" Both of them. They are the best! They have a nice beat and I would recommend this CD for people who can actually stand lots of cursing invloved in one song! Enjoy ;0)"
2,Kinda sad,"With great female latin vocalists like Omara Porteondo, Susana Baca, Cesaria Evora, Marisa Monte etc. etc. readily available you have to wonder why people bother with this junk."
3,This is an O.K. CD better than her first....,"some of the songs on this CD were really weird!!!!( no offence) . But i did find out one fact about J.LO that i didn't know about her...she's a total sex kitten ( like in her song ""come over"" with the lyrics go ""come over, lets make love 3 times slowly...."" The best songs on this alubm are ""love dont cost a thing"", ""Play"" and ""That's not me"".J.Lo has a pretty decent voice too."
2,Not for kids!,"Ok, I heard reviews that this was a good review, so I downloaded some of it on napster. I was listening to play and she says the f word on it! Ok, now I don't like music like that and I wanna know why it doesn't have a warning label on this cd. Unless this cd doesn't have this word on it. Anyway, if play didn't have that word it would be a decent song. Also Walking on sunshine and the 1st track is pretty good. Other than that, I'm not impressed at all. I give 2 stars for the 3 ok songs and for effort."
3,If you wanna dance..,".. buy JLo. If you're more into slow songs and ballads, you'd probably be better off with her first album. Lopez's upbeat tunes with get you out of a sedentary rut in no time. This album also features songs co-written by her long time partner, Puffy! If you're someone who likes to get down and dance, JLo is a great CD."
1,Terrible C.D.!,"I hate having the same first name as Jennifer Lopez! Her music is awful! This C.D. is awful! Don't buy it; it is a waste of money!Also, I hate Jennifer Lopez as a person. She grew up poor, yet she never gives any aid to poor people. She doesn't care about anything but money.To find out more about why I hate Jennifer Lopez, go to http://www.jlodown.com/"
1,Are you serious?,"Why is it that the people with the least talent are the ones we have to hear from the most? She can't sing, she can't act, and her clothes are horrible (not to mention poorly made!) There's got to be another Latina out there with some talent who truly deserves the spotlight. And for those who think she's not a diva like she says....try working with her! oh brother!"
4,"OK, but not great.","With last ablum's success, J.Lo (Jennifer Lopez) came out with a brand new album for 2K1. Again, his boyfriend Puff also helped in this album and added some R&B and hip&hop style to this album. In this album Jennifer Lopez included some dance songs, R&B,and of course, some Latino style dance songs. From my point of view this album isn't much different from the last one, you can tell that she's trying to try new things, but didn't worked very well. Then, again, if you enjoyed her last album, you'll also enjoy this one."
4,"Give the girl a break, admit ya love it...","So Jennifer Lopez isn't the greatest singer or songwriter in the world. Big deal. What makes her awesome is her genuine in enthusiasm for her music. This album is constantly in my cd player at home, and with me at the gym. It's got awesome dance tunes (Play, I'm Real) and of course, Lopez's staple latin style (Carino, Ain't It Funny) and even some tracks you don't know how to qualify (Dame, That's not me, That's the way). I love this cd for it's energy, it's just so much fun to listen to. Pop it in and have a good time with it... Jen's never claimed to be a serious, hardcore musical artist, so don't expect it from her, but she gives her all not matter what she's doing, and i think she's done it again.Best Song- Si Ya Se Acabo, PlayNeeds Work-Walking on Sunshine"
4,Jennifer Has Various Styles,"I didn't really care for Jennifer Lopez at first, but I bought this album on an impulse because the first hit single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" was an R&B smash, and so was the club friendly ""Play"". What I have come to realize is that Jennifer's new album is very upbeat and retro and might even appeal to people who have bought her debut album ""On The 6"". As for her vocals, I really don't see what all the fuss is about, she is capable of delivering notes just as good as other artists, but let me not make any comparisons. Besides the two obvious songs, I like others such as the funky techno-pop ""Walking On Sunshine,"" the rawness of ""Cari√±o,"" the sensuality of ""Secretly"" the optomistic ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" and the latin fused ""Dame"". If your the type of person who has a taste for all musical styles, then I would definitely recommend it! I hope you found my unbiased opinion helpful."
3,Pretty Good,"Although I'm not really a fan of Jennifer Lopez's music, I must say that I did like this CD. ""J.Lo"" is filled with good dance songs that immediately want to make you get up and dance! This CD also has the remix of ""I'm Real"" featuring JaRule, which was one of the most popular songs in 2001. If you're a fan of Jennifer Lopez, or you're just a fan of good dance music, buy this CD!"
2,"Where's your voice, JLo?","I really like Jennifer in movies. She's beautiful and has a depth and quality that I admire. She's mysterious and can handle herself with total confidence. In front of the camera, that is. On this CD, she hides behind so much technical mixing and erotic-robotics, that you can't even hear her voice on a lot of the tracks. Pitiful. I did not like this CD at all. Even her slow songs don't show the true depth of the quality her voice actually has when you hear it on a movie. I wouldn't have even known it was her except she's pictured on the front of the CD."
4,"""J.Lo"" does not macth up with ""On The 6""...","Jennifer Lopez' sophomore album, ""J.Lo"", is very entertaining. The opening single, ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" is very energetic, a perfect song to open the album. While I am very happy that Jennifer has gone Gold so far with this album, I felt that it simply is not as good as her first work, ""On The 6"".While ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" and other selected tracks are very well done, I felt that nothing on this disc conpared to ""If You Had My Love"" or other hits from the first CD.Hits that are reminecent or as big as ""If You Had My Love"", ""Waiting For Tonight"" and ""No Me Ames"" as well as the latin flavor from the first CD are sorely missed in this other wise fine Pure-Pop album. I <3 U JENNIFER, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
1,Boring!,"This is one of the most boring collections of music I have ever encountered. The music is repetitive, the beats are dull, the lyrics are unoriginal.Don't waste your money on this unless you are insomniac and are desperately in need of a dull sleep aid."
1,J -NO,"I am a fan of Jennifer Lopez as an actress, but she is not a singer. Recording technology can't even cover up her lack of singing abilities. She has proved she can't sing on her albums and live. Her albums only prove that the music industry is not about talent anymore."
5,wow,"after i heard jennifer lopez' first cd, i vowed never to buy another one of her cds. when i heard that i'm real with ja rule would be on this one though i ran out and bought it and i am NOT disappointed. the songs are edgier and are much more fun to listen to. her voice is so much better now and the songs are great. hopefully she can keep this up- she'll go far with her looks"
1,Get Real,"Ms. Lopez may be a good actress no doubt. However, as a singer, she falls short & is not the singing ""Diva"" some categorize her as. Let's give credit where credit is due. She hides her voice behind her backups which in turn drown her voice. She has no singing talent, therefore, she should stay in tune with her acting career. She has influenced those in the music industry, including her ex-beau ""Puffy"" Thanks to him & other talented music producers, her albums have been successful. They are the ones that write the songs, her backups sing great as opposed to her squeaky voice. For those crying out ""Haters"" or criticizing the opinions of others, let's not go as far as name calling. Afterall, everyone is entitled to their own opinions including yours. Whomever enjoys her singing, more power to you. As for those who enjoy real singing, buy the real albums. Music is beautiful when it is performed by a good singing artist."
2,mediocre,"i really like jennifer lopez, but maybe she should stick to acting. it's my first J-Lo CD i've purchased and i'll definitly think twice about buying any of her CDs in the future. only one or two decent songs on the cd. i wasted my money. i should've just listened to them on the radio."
4,IT's Great!!,"ok....the first 7 songs are a blast!! I like it so much. But when you contiune listening to it, you'll find that the last few songs are not as good as you thiugh it will be when you are buying it....but anyway.The music in this album is fantastic!!"
2,DON'T BUY THIS.,"Don't waste your money on this CD. I only liked the first song. ""Love don't cost a thing"". This was my first and will be my last time buying her CD."
2,J.Lo has to be clean now??,"This is the version of ""J.Lo"" with the new ""I'm Real"" remix, cleaned up. Wait for a single, it's not worth it, and without the unattractive swearing (which I'm not too fond of), it doesn't even make sense."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"""BUYER BEWARE"" for 2 reasons.1. The albums stinks. The only song that is worth listening to is PLAY, which brings us to reason number 2.2. PLAY has some major curses in it.This album will be purchsed and listened to by kids. Lopez's record company should have either deleted the words or placed a warning on the cover.Fortunatly, I was able to return the album and get my money back. And if I didn't, oh well, as long as it was out of the house."
2,two good songs,"i give this a two because there are only two good songs on the whole cd. the songs in which jennifer had a sigificant part in writing are really bad. i really like jennifer lopez, but her talent as a songwriter?......nonexistant. they sound like songs i could write. i like on the 6 a lot better than j.lo just because there is actual substance."
1,"This CD is what I would call ""FAKE MUSIC""","I think this CD is well-produced, but because of her weak and unskilled voice, the producers had to put lots of effects to polish it up"
2,Commercial Hype-like soooooooo many others,"oKAY, Miss Lopez needs some talent injected into her this is another exanple of commercial success...Formula=take a pretty face, sexy body, 1/4 talent, hype it up and BOOOOOOOM...sucess... I would have rated this cd an 1 but gave it an 2 because i do like some of the beats. Miss lopez can not sing she is cleverly disguised around beats sexy talk and an sexy look... She is not an artist with something to say just in it for the money...Now if it was me I'll probaly do the same but believe me when i say she is a packaged hollywood deal...She has one real talent I think which also can use work but her acting- she's pretty good. Anyway, if you want to get on the bandwagon buy it ...if you see through this fake demeanor FORGET ABOUT IT!!!!"
5,THE BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR FROM THE NEW MADONNA OF R'n'B !!!,"Well, what can I say ??? I was very enthusiastic at the idea of a new Jennifer Lopez album ....... Actually I liked ON THE 6 a lot & I was sure I would like this one too , yet I didn't like it ...... I totally fell in love with this funky & modern album !!! For me, J.Lo is the Madonna of Rn'B : Of course she doesn't have the most beautiful voice in the world but she has charisma & if U really love her, u'll love this CD which is so good that buying it nearly don't cost a thing !!!!"
1,Poor Jen...,"First she starred in Saliva, Selena, something that started with an ""S"", should of been ""sucks""!!!! She was kinda cool, but then she started to take off her clothes like boring Miraya, Myrayah, oh heck who cares how you spell it, as soon as they get suckcess, they start taking their clothes off, what ever happen to just focusing on the singer...Liza, Judy Garland, Patti Label, Chrissy Hines...and the still beautiful Blondie, they didn't take off their clothes...but, at least it she shows you who doesn't have any class...heh!...Keep the clothes on Jen and Cristina, especially you, Brittney, (whoever told her she could sing, all her songs sound the same!!!) I mean...we all know that there's no more mystery to you young gals...the true ladies of music, enhance their beauty by the clothing they wore, not taking it off every chance you get, leave it for your man...then he won't be running off with another..""Hole""!!!"
2,J. Lo. in need of better material,"This CD is a mixed bag, even with the remix of ""I'm Real"" which was added on to a later edition of this release. Lopez can barely sing, and while the tracks here aren't bad, they don't have enough attitude and spark to command your full attention. ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" recalls ""If You Had My Love""; ""Play"" is, lyrically, a carbon copy of Madonna's ""Music,"" and ""That's the Way"" is a second-rate Rodney Jerkins track. Here's hoping that her thrid effort will be better."
2,Don't Spend A Thing,"The only song I liked was the first single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"", please, just buy the single. The CD wasn't worth it. If I could give the CD back and get my money, I would. If you still wanna get this CD, just get the bootleg, that way you won't have spent as much and wont feel so bad when you realize it was a waste of money."
1,A vast improvement,"Well, I must say that I did buy her first album becuasue I liked waiting for tonight/ and sadly to say that was the only song I really liked. I did give J LO another chance and I was not dissapointed becuase I didn't set my expectations high. THis one did have a few more songs that I liked , mostly PLAY. I think that she is a better actress than singer, but the way the songs were enhanced made J Lo's voice sound better, if it werent' for that she wouldn't sound so good, and I probably would say don't waste good money, but with the special effects and some of the upbeat songs, it's no so bad, Just as long as you don't expect an awesome CD you'll find this one satisfactory, at least to play a few weeks."
1,"Great Actress, Bad Music","This album has no shred of musicianship, creativity, originality, or even for that matter memorable songs. I suggest you get the music of Gloria Estefan someone who can REALLY sing and is very talented than get an album like this with absolutely no substance. Jennifer Lopez's Singing Career is ALL image NO substance."
1,the better rating is 0 stars,"when i first heard her Play, I thought it's gotta be a good R&B-Dance album overall, but when i've listened to it couple of times it just grew on me and....i hate it. If not her worst album ever, than pretty much the worst album of the year 2001. This girl cant' sing and will never do. So if you want a perfect example of bad singing and horrible songs, this album is for you. Enjoy & Courrage!!!!"
3,"j.Lo...hmm, nice actress. Pretty hot. Artist?","Jennifer's 2nd album is almost the exact same as ""On the 6."" In a way I prefer her first album then 2nd, or the 2nd then the first. Her top 3 smash hit 'Love don't cost a thing,' was chart buster on radio and television, it's a good-danceable track--butt it gets really anoyying after you listen to it a number of times. 'Play' great track, very catchy, not really a good meaning for the song, and same problem as 'love don't cost...' 'Ain't it funny' nice song, OK video, butt same problem as the same two songs. 'I'm Real' I hate listening to it, butt the video rocks!--And the MURDER REMIX, featuring jA rULe is awesome, video rocks too---the best. She can't really strectch hear vocal to a high-pitch or low voice. So can't really say she's gonna have long career in music."
1,Jennifer's Music,"I kind-of like here music, but I don't think she should be on the Latin Page. Even though she has a latin name, she DOES NOT sing any Latin music, so she shouldn't be recognized as a latin singer."
1,What a cow,"Hey Jennifer: MOOOOOOOOOOO The best lyric ever: ""What I need from you is not available in stores"""
1,Stick to dancing please.,"Would someone just tell this ghetto chick to just stick to dancing.This woman cant sing or act,so stick to dancing jennifer.All the songs sound the same and are very boring.The im real theme in her songs is getting very old and annoying.Who is she trying to fool by venturing into hip hop and featuring all hip hop rappers?Just another commercial ploy to make more money off of alot of trendy and simple minded people out there.Sooner or later this woman will get exposed as being all about image and none about musical ability.DONT BUY THIS CD!!!"
2,a good effort,J Lo? What's up with that? All of her music sounds the same. I guess that's a good thing if you're a fan (which I'm not). She lacks good vocals and depends on a beat to get through a song. You'll like this ONLY if you're a BIG fan.
4,MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST,"When I purchased this CD, I was apprehensive. I have ""On the 6"" and I was not impressed, but her single ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" was one of the best songs I'd heard on the radio for a long time so I gave it a shot. I was very pleased. I think MY favorite song is ""I'm Real"" (song #2). It's got a really happy beat and an overall happy and dancable groove. The only times Jennifer gets annoying is her slow songs. If this was a total dance album, it would've been better. But there ARE more dance tracks than sappy ballads,and a totally enjoyable purchase over all. I'm very glad that I own this one. I can't wait to see what she puts out next!!"
1,"Only play ""Play"".","This LP receives only 1 star.""Play"" is the only worthy track on this LP. Otherwise, it's just garbage."
1,Stick to Acting!,"It's interesting to read the comments about Jennifer Lopez from some of her lovesick male fans! She has a TON of them does she not? Well, I'm a woman who sees her for exactly what she is...a very talented and beautiful actress that should stick to the silver screen. I think this woman is EXTREMELY overrated, especially when it comes to her singing. Her TRUE talent lies in her ability to market herself and keep the public's eye on her...in her private life as well as professional. Her second CD is mediocre at best. I agree with another reviewer when he said that some of the lyrics of her songs are downright cheesy, and you get the feeling on some of these tracks that you've heard the lyrics before, only somewhere else! Again I agree with the other reviewer when he says save your money, they will play these songs to death on the radio!"
1,Sigh,"Jennifer Lopez is a prime example of what is wrong with the music industry. She cannot sing, write songs, or produce. The only reason she is successful is because she prances around half naked and sells the same crappy and tiresome music that is already out there. Find some real music!"
2,I'm real...really,"Okay, so Jennifer Lopez isn't exactly Miss Diva. She has no talent as an artist. Let's admit it the girl can't sing. It impresses me that even though she can't sing she's still popular, but I guess it's the same way with Britney. However, I must admit that some of her songs are good. However, this album gets annoying over time. I used to like Love don't cost a thing and Play but now I always skip these tracks.Favorite tracks worth listening to is: I'm real, Ain't it funny, Come over, Dance wtih me, and That's the wayOther good songs are remixes such as: I'm real (Murder remix) and Ain't it funny (Murder remix and It's gonna be alright (Remix). But for these tracks you'll have to buy J-Lo the remixes. This album is not that great it's just okay. J-lo is a great dancer and actress but she lacks vocally. She should just stick to acting however, she still has the hits to keep her going. I guess is one of the reasons why I bought On the 6 and J-Lo"
3,Updated Review: It gets boring!!,"As much as I admire Jennifer Lopez, I'm afraid this CD gets old fast. The only one's worth listening to are ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"", ""Play"", ""I'm Real (Murda Remix)"" and ""Secretly."" Her voice gets annoying. She shouldn't try singing so hard. Just use it nice and lightly. I mean, look at how well Gloria Estifan used her decent voice when it was not exactly really spectacular. ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" is another good upbeat song and the remix is just as good. The Rodney ""DarkChild"" Jenkins track ""That's The Way"" is boring and predictable. DarkChild hasn't produced a good song since '99. I'm not gonna even go into how bad the original ""I'm Real"" is. It really needed remixing big time...so call on Murda Inc! It sounds great! As for her next album she needs to work less on trying to sing like she has an extremely powerful voice (like christina has). Overall grade for J LO: C"
1,"""I'm Real""?","First, of all if you're buying this cd for the ""I'm Real"" remix...go out and buy Mariah Carey's Glitter CD. Apparently J. Lo isn't so real because she took her I'm real song right from Mariah's ""If we"" song with Ja Rule. Jennifer Lopez is not a talented singer. She is just trying to be something she's not. If it wasn't for Mariah, J. Lo's singing career would still be where it started. She would have never made the ""I'm Real"" remix because she has no mind of her own! SERIOUSLY Save your money...this girl is definantly not real! Go out and buy the REAL thing, MARIAH CAREY ""GLITTER"". Also why can't we put zero stars, thats what it deserves?"
1,Just image and hype,"I am from Puerto Rico, just like J.Lo, and in terms of putting our island on the international map, she gets my blessing. But I have to agree with another reviewer that she really can't sing at all. Plus, this album, like the others, is just mostly machine generated sounds, therefore not music. It is obviously purposefully manufactured with the only intention of selling as many cds as possible. Guess what? Given the ignorant musical climate of recent years and with her formidable physical beauty, that is not too difficult. Its the image that sells. To me, J.Lo's greatest talent is dancing, and second to that, acting. She could be a great choreographer/dance coach, and also an actress. That would make you rich enough, wouldn't it? Oh, well, long live good looks and the too-much-money-is-never-enough-so-lets-get-as-filthy-rich-as-possible mentality."
4,"J Lo, catchy...","Jennifer Lopez, now known as J Lo has sprung her Spanish and soulful roots into one to make an awesome c-d. Her catchy tunes keep her in line and her outrageous dancing seems to fit her best. But what happens when she goes to far to hande, swearing in her songs like she doesn't care, polluting the minds of young children everywhere, like Eminem so oftenly does. What happens when your 75 year old grandmother hears this? In ""play"" her screaming ""play my mother f****** song!"" is not what I call music. J Lo, get a handle on it..."
2,I liked the first one better,"On the 6 is a good mix of English and Latin music and has a balance of ballads and dance songs. J.Lo, however, sounds like a confused mix of somebody else's songs in one album. Destiny's Child, Janet Jackson, Madonna seems to be the influence behind her songs. I had a feeling that she's trying to be someone she isn't. In the On the 6 album, I loved her dance songs but equally adored her slower selections like No Me Ames. Songs like these are conspicously absent in this album. Which is a shame, really!"
3,can't she choose between spanish and r&b?,"I love the singles that were released and became hits, those are catchy dance numbers with hypnotizing beats and great melodies and harmonies, that one almost forgets that j lo doesn't have much of a voice. But what I don't get is why people are calling her music latin music when she is not even representative of the great latin music out there. And most of her singles happen to be R&B and very few on the CD's have that latin flavour to it, Aint It Funny in it's originality was perfect and then she made it hip hop and it wasn't even as good as the ja rule mix of I'm Real. Makes you kind of wonder whether she's trying to be something she's not to make money doesn't it? Anyways check out this album if you want, but the only good singles are the ones that were released. If you want to check out j lo at her best, get the selena movie."
4,She still can't sing but the cd is very good,"I'm not a fan of J.Lo's ""singing"" but you have to admit she has some good beats, and talented producers on this album. I think she sounds better in spanish then english. You should buy this album if you're looking for some fun music. My favorite songs are ""Dame"" con Chayanne (i love him he has a beautiful voice as well as gorgeous) and ""Si ya se acabo"" I think most of us has been a relationship where its ending and dont know why. Buy this album its very good."
2,one awesome song,the only good song on the whole album is the im real remix with ja rule!!!!!!My fav song of the year by far
3,Don't Get Too Excited,"While I admit that the first four tracks or so are wonderful, the rest is just Jennifer trying to prove that she's a big girl because she can write songs. The Spanish songs are o.k. because she's Latin but I don't think you should put Spanish and English songs all on the same album. I think she should do a Spanish album like Christina Aguleria. If you're a hard-core J.Lo fan then you SHOULD buy the album but if you only kinda like her you should burn the cd from a friend, don't pay money."
1,It's Puffy's Ex!!,"She's so talented..... ""Singer"", ""Actress"",""Famous Girlfriend"", ""Shooting Witness"". Wow. She does it all, or that's what her publicity machine would have you believe. The fact is that she can't sing, she can't act and now that she got her Puffy growth removed, she has a limited amount of shelf life.This is just one more in a long line of hyped up hoochies who look good in a tight outfit but have less talent than a trained cat.People, have some self respect, don't buy this nonsense."
3,Great party CD,"but if you're looking for anything beyond that then skip this CD. She has absolutely no singing talent, and it's lyrically horrible. They've done a great job selling her, just look at her album sales, but she'll never be taken seriously as a female songstress.I'm hoping for a more mature album next time, both lyrically and vocally, although I'm not holding my breath."
3,Ummmmm,"This is sort of a hate and love situation with ""J.LO."" Back in 99 when her first single came out I scoffed at the idea of actress turned singer and immediately rode her off, but once Waiting For Tonight hit airwaves I was instantly impressed. Then comes her sophmore release and once again I find myself hating the first single, Love Don't Cost A Thing, but the second I heard Play come on the radio I turned up the volume key and just moved with the groove. I've grown tired of it already (which is the major problem with pop and me) but I can't seem to get enough of Walking On Sunshine and the spanish dance funkish Aint It Funny and Dame (Touch Me.) I also enjoy the r&b spiced Dance With Me, and the slow ballad, That's Not Me. But I must declare how much I deteste and spit at I'm Real - especially the remix version with Ja Rule... Ugh!!! Overall, though, this is fairly enjoyable and worth a listen or two. Definitely nothing special, though."
1,Is that JLO'S niece singing with JARULE the song I 'M REAL?,"Don't tell me that , that's Jlo what , I thought it was her niece. You see people , when you come across so called ""Artists"" that don't know how to sing is very hard to recognize their voice cause they change it all the time.Just listen to the song I'AM REAL with JARULE, it totally dosen't sound like her.I think JLO needs to go back and get into the 6 train and get back to singing school, and stop asking her niece for favors.Don't buy it!!"
3,Explicit content!,"Just for you parents or guardians supervising children on this album, Jennifer has gone bad, and I personally don't like it. In the song ""play"" she says the words ""Mother F---ing song"" and in the song ""i'm real"" she uses profane language several times. I hope this was helpful so think twice about this album and look for an edited one (I hope they have them)."
2,Never knew what to expect...,"What better way to boost off into mainstream happy-land than a duet with Ja Rule automatically becoming a huge radio-friendly smash? Jennifer Lopez is a fine actresse and she shouldve stuck to it just like many actors are trying to do, branch out to music, but fail miserablly. I can't really call Jennifer Lope- err i mean J LO a failure after the millions of copies sold of her album, but it fails to hit the soft spot in hip-hop which it sounded like she was aiming for. Jennifer Lopez never really had any vocal talent to begin with but this album dims her vocals so much more and all thats to pay attention to is the dull beat in every song. But despite of this everyone knows that J Lo will stay a huge household name worldwide...even if she is lacking talent in the music industry, but hey whatever brings in the ""rocks"""
1,This is a total let down,"If you are a person who thinks that they will like this cd. think again because i did the same thing and i did not like it abit. The only decent song is play. This song should say that it features christina milian. The rest of the songs are annoying. Jennifer lopez proves everyone that she is no better a songwriter than she is a singer, for example:come over - This showcases jennifers lack in talent and songwriting skills. Her vocals are lacking quality, and style.carino - In this song she only sings the verses (which she does in 90 percent of all the songs on the album, such as play, and aint it funny)Jennifer lacks in telling us that it is christina milan singing in the chorus of play. I think that this album stinks. Dont buy this album. Jennifer hardly even sings in any of the songs. I think that jennifer is annoying."
2,Jenny this is the beginning of the end,"This is where I personally think that jennifer lopez began to lose it, her style changed and it just don't seem the same."
3,"Nice improvement, but still not it","This album is better that On the 6. As usual, the best songs are the singles: Love don't cost a thing, I'm real, Play, and Ain't it funny. That's not me and Dance with me are also good. The rest of the songs are mediocre and without substance. I, for one, hate the I'm Real remix. Senseless. I preferred the Ain't it funny remix. If you only like the singles, wait until the record company releases a greatest hits collection."
5,Great Cd,"I love this cd. I'm gonna give you a rundown of everyhing on the cd and what I think.Love Don't Cost A Thing- We all know this song so I won't get into it.I'm Real- I love this one. Nice dance track.Play-Gotta love this one. Great song to jam to.Walking On Sunshine-Great song. I really like this one. Upbeat chrous and slow verses.Aint It Funny- Ok songCanrio- Nice beatCome Over- I like this one. I don't really agree with the message but its a good slow jam.We Gotta Talk- This is one of my faves. Great song, you'll have this one on repeat.I love the end when they sing without music.Thats Not Me- I truly love this one, its one of my faves. The 2nd bridge is my favorite part.Dance With Me- My fave track off the cd. Mid-tempo, just an all around good song.Secrectly- Great song. So many people are going through what this song is about so I can totally relate. Not her usual dance song.Love that piano."
2,How 'real' is it...?,"I don't know Jennifer personally. She may be a great girl.But honestly, if she writes one more song about how real she is, or how she is the same old 'Jenny from the block',' I swear I will [*insert harsh expressive term here*] It gets old so fast. I am surprised her label isn't telling her the same thing. There's another wildly popular girl singing the same songs over and over again, and she's been relegated to the pre-teen set (and to that of older guys who get no booty). If this keeps up, we'll see that happen to Ms. Lopez sooner than we think.The best thing I can say is at least she hasn't gone the way of Ms. Carey...Jenny, hon, as much as we all love hip-hop (I was raised on it, so I'm not hatin'), try something new, or stick to the big screen.P.S. It's true, she does sound perfect with Ja Rule. But then, I've never heard a true hip-hop fan say anything good about Ja Rule..."
1,"Her Love doesn't cost a thing, and neither should this album","Jennifer Lopez is a very actress actress who is making a steady climb to the top of her professions; as an ACTRESS! I like Jennifer. Its great seeing a woman of color actually suceeding in a industry, such as the entertainment industry, that will honor practically anything blonde and thin. But she just cannot sing. This seems to be a fact that few people notice. In every interview they usually talk about whomever she happens to be dating or what she's wearing. I'm scared that all of this talk may actually have her believing that shes good. Say it ain't so Jennifer!"
4,very good second album,"I found myself listening more to the latter songs like Walking on Sunshine, Cabrina, and Ain't It Funny. i still love the first 3 tracks, so overall this is a marked improvement for Jennifer :-)"
4,Better than On the 6,"This is a great cd. You've all heard ""Love don't cost a thing"" and it's a great song. Other good songs include ""Aint it Funny"" which is my favorite song on the album and could be the third single, with ""Play"" being the second. ""We Gotta Talk"" and ""That's Not Me"" are other good songs and you can't forget ""I'm Real"" and ""Walking on Sunshine"". All the other songs are good, but the songs I listed are what do buy the cd for."
2,lame booty mix,"Gimme a break. What is this? A Brittany Spears album with extra booty flavor? The songs on this album put me to sleep. The only song that I enjoyed was ""Love don't cost a thing"" which I doubt that Senorita Lopez wrote all by herself because to me, her love for puffy was all about putting this amateur album on the market. I lost 20 bucks to the cd store. Hopefully, when Jennifer gets some money off her behind, she can donate it to those poor folks who made the mistake of ever taking up this album off the shelf. I can't sing myself, but I surely know where to draw that line. I think Jenny should stick to acting. I'm quite spent on her lame publicity stunts."
4,"Fun, dance heavy album!","Jennifer Lopez's second album, J Lo, was one that I played a lot during 2001. I love the opening 3, Love Don't Cost A Thing, I'm Real and Play as well as Walking On Sunshine. The Cory Rooney and Trackmasters and Ric Wake songs are also heavy on the dance sounds. I like the sexy Dance With Me and the way Puffy and Mario Winans can do the beats and music on it with its shuffling feel. Ain't It Funny and its Latin rhythms I love. I like that one ballad in the middle, Come Over. But this is such a consistent and fun album for the hour it lasts."
1,stop,"She can't really sing, most girls can sing just the same, it's called modern recording equipment. Brief history: First she was a dancer, doing moves choreographed by someone else(okay), then she was an actress acting parts written and directed by someone else(fine), then she's a singer who doesn't write her own material(not to mention remixes of remixes), now she's a restaurantuer who didn't come up with the menu(enough!). Also if you want to see an example of a nice rump check out Natalie Raitano."
2,Wack album (hate to say it),"I hate to say it, but this album was way wack. I was expecting big things because she's always in the media, so I was expecting her boyfriend to produce some bomb tracks for the album, but I was saddly mistaken. Don't get me wrong though, there are about 2 tolerable songs on the album, I like ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" and ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" but that's about it. Get a Janet Jackson album because this is not hitting. Later."
1,It makes me want to cry (for all the wrong reasons),"JLO is riding on undeserved fame. Yeah she can carry a tune, and maybe she can write a few of her own lyrics (ok, maybe not) but the only reason she made it into music and movies was because of one REAL Latina: Selena Quintanilla-Perez. JENNIFER LOPEZ WOULD BE NOTHING IF IT WASN'T FOR THE DEATH OF SELENA. It's disgusting that she can attain fame on borrowed wings while a wealth of talented latina vocalists remain undiscovered."
4,It's ok.,"Yah I liked it, but it's not the greatest album ever. I did like ""Aint It Funny"", ""Love Don't Cost a Thing,"" and other songs. Well that's all I have to say."
4,"Great Book--More Shoe Photos, Please","I really loved this book. I have no experience in creating clothing for my 15"" Franklin Mint fashion dolls & the shoes that came with the dolls are a major disappointment. I hope to be able to rectify that soon with my husband's help in creating lasts & molds.I gave the book 4 stars because, although the creation & design processes are detailed very thoroughly, there is a dearth of good photos of finished shoes. Many of the shoes that are shown tend to be somewhat hidden under the hem of a doll's outfit, the folds of artistically draped fabric, or the lid of a colorful candy box.As suggestions for a second edition: If I could re-edit this book, I would add more finished shoes, add patterns for other popular fashion dolls (such as Franklin Mint vinyls,) & change the typeface font to something less fussy, with full margin justification."
1,Is this intended as a serious book or is it farce/comedy?,"Really people, just look at the description of the book, under the ""Citations"" heading. The author actually cited a 60 page booklet summary of Darwin's work. She did not even bother to read what he actually wrote. Nor did she even have the good sense to PRETEND she read it. Instead, she actually cited the equivalent of the Cliff's Notes version of the single most important work in the field of biology in history."
1,An disappointing first look by a dilettante,"I bought this book because of what it claimed to be- an honest and objective look at the origins of life, with no agenda being established at the outset. I was quite disappointed to find that I've been lied to, yet again.This book is all about preaching to the choir. It does nothing to help someone making a inquiry into creationism vs actual science- it just tries to lie its way into the hearts and minds of those reading it.Verdict: Not recommended."
1,Another predictable yet failed attempt to legitimize ID.,"If there was legitimate science involved in ID we would have heard it by now. In fact we have heard their best and it was overwhelmingly dismissed. This book does absolutely nothing for the conversation, and ultimately is a waste of paper, ink, and time. To summarize, it is garbage."
5,Objective reporting,"This represents, to me, an objective view of the controversy and the reactions it spawns. It is thoroughly researched and documented. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in more than the typical emotional reactions on this subject.Gerry O"
1,Very biased. Make that EXTREMELY biased.,"Though this book pretends to show all sides fairly, it's extremely biased against evolution (and poorly researched on that side too). A quick look at the positive reviews here will show you that they are from people who are on the ID/Creation side. It's a waste of time and paper, unless you just want to make yourself feel good about believing in ID/Creation."
1,Stay away from these scammers!,I have now experienced how horrible this company is - they do not answer their telephones or return any messages. I have sent in all requested information in order to have my Canon camera repaired and get no reply. I have also read numerous reviews by other dissatisfied customers describing a similiar experience. Don't waste your money!
5,An overlooked classic.,"'The Crane' is one of the most beatifully written childrens stories of this century. It is a parable that carries many important questions about who we are and how we live. As a teacher of English, I have found this book a remarkable resource and one that really allows for differentiation of learning with children around 11-12. It is a funny, sad and very touching story and I emplore somebody to reprint it, so that more people can access this wonderfull book. Why it isn't more widely known I do not understand."
4,An excellent resource for art nouveau design,"A truly beautiful book, many of the plates are full page and in full color. His nudes and semi-nudes are entirely captivating with exquisite attention to detail. The remainder of the plates are tints and depict various items in art nouveau style (jewelry, silverware, china, etc.). There are also a few pages containing color borders and backgrounds. The copyright in this book is unusual for Dover Publications, as it grants no explicit free-use of the images contained within it."
4,Great obscure movie.,"Learning Curve is a great little movie that shows what teachers would really like to do to their students if they could. It's a very entertaining movie, it contains nudity so anyone that may be offended by this should not watch it. But it is a different kind of movie, has humor as well as drama. I really love this movie and don't let the bad cover picture fool you.I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like mainstream movies.Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
4,If you are looking for something different....,"....then this is it.The film is about a teacher who has had enough of uncivil students and their bad behavior including the use of vulgar language, harassment, threats and rudeness in a system that has failed just about everyone. The teacher constructs an elaborate scheme to teach his troubled students a lesson once and for all. Under his control, the students will be forced to learn or suffer the consequences.Some of the scenes are very satisfying to watch. Probably many teachers were cheering this on. A lot of it though is very unrealistic and you have to take it with a grain of salt. You have to just go along for the ride.The film is low budget and slightly amateurish. There are a couple of scenes where the dialogue didn't match the movement of the actor's mouths. There are times when the production is cheap and it's a bit hard to take however, most people who like comedy or something offbeat will enjoy this. It's worth seeing."
1,horrible and now broken,"I agree with the other reviews - these headphones are TERRIBLE. Now the top band snapped and they dig into my head - I thought they were uncomfortable before, but now they are not even worth using. Sad waste of my money."
3,Not bad,"I totally agree with the electronics fan who said that the product was ok and i would like to add...Although the sound quality is great and the design is nice the quality of the headphones itself is terrible!! well i can't explain it cause you just have to feel it! (Cheap)Although i bought it brand new i noticed a big annoying scratch! you would say maybe someone opened it before you but no, the box is that kind of boxes that cannot be opened twice which means ..... RCA doesn't mind selling a scratched Product! :s"
1,Piece of Junk (@!!!*&$),Don't buy this junk. It works when it wants to. If you have a low sound coming to the headphones then it will automatically turn off even when you have the switch turned on. It's rather unfortunate that the quality of RCA products has deteriorated into junk status.
1,Doesn't work as advertised,sound cuts in and out frequently and as close as 10 feet away from base. I recommend getting the Sharper Image Wireless headphones.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"If there was a ""fraction"" or no star rating this product would be more than deserving! Constant loss of transmission and static within 5-8 ft. The plastic head band section on the headphones snapped in less than 3 months. Please don't wast your money on this product."
1,Worst headphones ever,There is always a horrible static sound. If you move or breathe to heavily the sound will cut out. Sometimes blinking is enough to make sound cut out. Even if there was no static and no cutting out the music that comes out these headphones seems muffled. Even if it produced good sound these things are so uncomfortable they give you a headache. Even if they produced good sound and were comfortable they are made of cheap plastic and would break in half eventually.
4,Great snack,The individual packets make this snack great to keep with you whenever you want something sweet and healthy. Just make sure it stays out of the sun!!!
2,Only for people who are big fans of Ultimate Iron Man,"I am a huge fan of the Marvel Ultimate Universe. But fans of the Ultimate series may just want to skip this one. It has a different writer and a different artist than any of the Ultimate series, and it shows. The plot is one dimensional and the art is sub-par.Instead of this I strongly urge you to get Marvel Ultimate Iron Man by Orson Scott Card."
2,Introduction for novices,"I agree with the previous reviewer. An introduction aimed at those with no previous knowledge economics, since having any would hamper the author's credibility, I am afraid."
4,A Fun Read,"This is book was mentioned by a Pulitzer prize winning author, now a professor, Barry Sigel at an Olli class at University of California, Irvine. It was written before the term ""literary journalism"" was classified as such.Today's standards are different for literary journalism but his view is Old Mr Flood stands apart and is well done. The character is not one person, but a composite and the feel and smells of the fish market are almost palpable. This author knows fish!!A bit of tension ~ the force of growing older, not wanting to miss of day of life."
2,If you have a GBA then forget this thing!,"This product is pretty weak, if you have a GBA get the GBA video instead. VideoNOW has (really) short battery life and mostly all just Nick shows,GBA video has cartoon network shows,yu-gi-oh,and dragon ball GT,All in color!Its better than this thing!"
1,psh!! waste of money!!,Oh my Gosh! who would spent their money on a video now!? it has a tiny little screen. and you pay even more for little cds to play shows on them and i bet you cant even see the screen it is so small. i do not have one nor would i ever buy one. You pay money for shows that you watch over and over again. i would rather buy a portable dvd player or a tv to go in the car.
2,Video Now Color,"I first it worked and I loved it. I bought a video color and in a few months it stopped working. It would turn off when I was watching the fairy godparents and this ticked me off. Trust me you do not want to buy this, I wasted 50 bucks on it when it first came out!! Do NOT waste your money on it."
2,Don't waste Your money,"This product is a waste of money. The whole marketing strategy is to come out with an ok model, then the next year come out with a newer better model to bribe people with the older one to get a new one every time the manufature comes out with a better model. So buy something worth your money like a Game Boy Advanced SP that way you have a larger light-up screen and you can also play games."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!,"This toy is the best. Like you can watch great shows and it is soooo cool for finals I mean someone can get really bored after a final. Plus you can take it anywhere. I was thinking of getting the new portable dvd player for teens, but this is way better!!! I am definetley getting this for christmas!!!"
5,Great Videos,"My Dad got me the Video Now in color. It is soooo cool. He also got me a bunch of cool discs. Some are all about the XGames and they have great action and funny stories about the guys. My two favorites are Jaime Bestwick, only the most awesome BMX rider ever, he is so cool and really funny. also the graphics look totally cool better than anything on TV. Another one is Taj Burrow an awesome surfer, he makes it look so easy. I really wanna try surfing now, it looks like the most fun in the world. Thanks Hasbro now i'll be in the XGames now..... lol"
2,Pros & Cons,"PROS*Easy to use*Portable*Good shows for younger kids, Nickelodeon mostlyCONS*Bad Graphics*Tiny Screen*Expensive, but not worth it*Limited showsWell, I guess if you're a four-year-old, you dont really care about the screen, the price, the graphics, or the show you're watching, but still, you can literally go blind. The idea of Video Now is cool, but trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. The so-called 'color' is choppy-game-boy-color-from-1998.My recommendations are.....Buy a game boy for your kidIf you really want to take a shot at this, make sure you see someone that has it first, and take a look what you're really purchasing.Buy a portable DVD player, like a Sony, which you can buy in most electronic stores."
1,Terrible waste of money,"I bought one of these Video Nows for each of my kids. Two weeks later, the screen did not work (completely black). I thought they had mishandled them and we had a long trip coming up, so I reluctantly bought two more. I took one out of the package, put new batteries in, and the screen did not work. All four of the Video Nows that I purchased were broken either immediately out of the package or in less than two weeks. I purchased these toys from a Wal-Mart and they refused to take three of them back because I did not have the plastic packaging they had come in. For the same price of this toy, coupled with headphones, car lighter adapter, and the PVDs that will only play in the Video Nows, you can purchase a portable DVD player which is a much better product and a much better value. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this toy."
3,"good for a recent book, but not on the same level as her 80s","Yeah, I agree it is good. But I am trying to find her first 50 books, from way back in the 80s. Now THOSE were good! I wonder what happened? I think she was in a bad relationship, and now writes in a more fairy-tale vein."
1,Its smoked my PC,"Just to put it plainly, this software sucks, after running automatic optimasation, my PC failed to reboot and had to restore the entire windows. thanks god for acronis softwre.no star for this 1 is even too much"
1,If you like your pesto to taste like pickles...,"I was thrilled to find this in my local grocery chain, thinking it would be a great shelf-stable alternative to the refrigerated pesto sauces I usually purchase. I was wrong. It has a very strong, briney taste to it. I only recommend purchasing this product if you like your pesto to taste like pickles."
2,Unreasonably salty in my opinion,"Too much salt in this product. You'll regret using it if you have any other source of salt in your dish, e.g., pasta cooked in salted water, feta cheese, brined olives, etc.I far prefer the pesto marketed under the ""Buitoni"" brand (Nestle foods) that is sold in the refrigerated foods section at the grocery store, as that pesto has excellent taste without going over-the-top on salt. The Classico product has almost 50% more salt in the same size serving, relative to the Buitoni pesto.I have nothing against salt, or salty foods, but the amount of salt in this Classico pesto is unjustifiable and may well spoil your dish."
1,Terrible! Doesn't taste like pesto...,"I hate this ""pesto."" I thought I would try this brand out of curiosity, but totally regret it. This is the weirdest tasting pesto I've ever had. It tastes like pickles and garlic and other weird flavors I can't describe - but it does not taste like pesto. If you want your pasta to have an overwhelming pickled flavor, then get this. The weird taste is very strong - I added only a little bit to a large bowl of noodles (I had a hunch it was going to be bad once I opened the jar, the smell is very powerful), and luckily I had other good brands of pesto around to try to save the pasta - yet you could still taste this gross pickle pesto because it's so strong and weird. Go with another brand instead!"
5,They all do.,All car seat handles protrude. That does not make the car seat a recall issue that would be operator error and the manufacturer should apologize.
4,Great improvs on the classics,"Just saw the 60 minutes, great stuff. The improvs are similar in concept to Ken Pedersen's 'Deja Views' which was in the top 5 on the New Age Charts for six months in 1999. Gabriela's virtuousity is amazing. Deja Views is more meditative."
5,One of the Best!,"Gabriela is one of the world's finest pianists. But more than that, she is a superb musician. Any PC can ""Play"" classical piano perfectly. Any person who has that technical ability, while quite impressive, is somewhat common, at least on the easier pieces. Not only does Gabriela have that ability, even on the very hard pieces, but she can also play what she calls improvisations. This is a good word for a special talent, as everyone understands it. What it really is is the ability to compose and arrange music real time, while playing the music, and putting the human element back into it. Music is an emotional amplifier, and Gabriela can add any kind of emotion to any musical piece. This is a talent far greater than her already impressive technical abilities. There are very few musicians whose names are more important that what they play, such as Vladimir Horowitz, Paul McCartney, Lennard Bernstein. Add Gabriela Montero to that short list."
4,A New Favorite in Your Music Library,"Gabriela Montero's CD Piano Recital will hold a favorite place in your musical recording collection. It has a balanced mix of compositions by major composers and Montero's improvisations. Her phrasing sings and her technique is brillliante. She plays with a felicitous touch; there's no banging on the keys, but she knows where the bottom is and can float delicately across the top, too. The recording engineers may have compressed the dynamic range, somewhat, between pianissimo and fortissimo. IMHO, the repertoire on this CD is far better than the new Bach and Beyond CD."
5,Gabriela the Great!,"I am so glad that someone recently ""found"" Gabriela and her work is getting published! This is some of the best piano solo I have ever heard. After hearing a spot on National Public Radio I bought the CD, and am delighted."
5,a must have,"if you do not have this DVD yet, get it now! very easy to follow along. quick and effective patterns"
2,"not bad, but...","This book is ok, but I really like pictures in my cookbook. Very informative!, healthy. A little confusing, like I would put all the rice, noodles ect together then the correct countries under each title."
4,More than helpful,"This reference book on daytrips of Ireland was a Godsend. I found myself referring to it daily. Maps, areas to see and not miss. Areas I had no idea even exsisted and gave me an insiders guide to an area that has so much more to see than the regular tourist traps."
3,A Suprisingly good Werewolf movie,"The first time I saw this movie was on tv, SciFi channel. I didn't have much hope that it would be any good but was very surprised! The acting is fine, for a low budget horror movie, and the special effects are not all that bad. The story is very interesting and original as well. A team of scientist are trying to prefect a new synthetic skin but they have been having problems. After a short period of time the skin hardens and it becomes like steel. well this military coronal, the project leader tells them to work on a cadaver that he supplies. They do, he comes back to life and turns out to be a werewolf, now with really hard hide.If you like horror movies especially werewolves and don't mind it being low budge, than this is a gem!"
4,My dog did not go wild over it but ate it eventually,"My dog would not eat these at first and I almost gave up, but he finally ate a few tonight when I added warm water and a little bit of cooked bison to it. Then he ate a few pieces of it. I did not give it five stars becasue he was reluctant to eat it at first and it is overpriced."
5,saved my dog worth any price,"I have a 10 month old poodle pome lasa mix,she was very ill when I got her at 10 weeks(maybe she came from a puppy mill}.I had to feed her with a syringe to get some nutrition in her,she got better but still had a huge problem eating.I tried every high quality brand out there, I even made homemade dog food.She would eat a little but not enough for a growing puppy.The Dr Harveys power patties are a life saver.I add one to her dog food and she will eat it all up.This was a dog who would turn her nose up at steak.I cant thank Dr Harvey enough.I tried other Tripe products and she didnt like them.Dr Harveys is the only one out there WITH NO ADDED INGREDIENTS just Tripe.In Europe dogs thrive on Tripe alone so I know if she just ate that she would be fine.This dog means everything to me and when I couldnt get her to eat I was devastated .The power patties have eased my mind and my dog is doing wonderfully."
5,"A violent love story, in which money is not enough.","Greasey repulsive loser Warren Oates is in love with a whore. As a matter of fact that is the only thing he has going for him. But he believes he also needs money to make him happy. By chasing after the money, his loved one dies. And as he continues to persue the money he finds that no amount of money will now take her place."
4,Nice Blu-Ray release,"Since no one will likely buy the Blu-Ray unless they already know and like the movie, let me just say that this is a nice-looking Blu-Ray release from Suevia, which is not known for the quality of its typical DVD releases. There were only a couple of rough spots; for the most part, it was just like a theatrical presentation. Highly Recommended."
4,"Great non-Western,Western","I sat down to watch this under the impression it was a Western, and for the first 5 minutes, one cannot tell it is set in the 70's. A prominent Mexican jefe puts an edict on the gigolo who impregnated his young daughter. ""Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia!!"" he declares to a large group of minions, thugs and general bad guys filling his palacial hacienda.The gates of the compound fly open and out roll a caravan led by horses and followed by car. I guess the suprise is seeing this Old West mentality practiced in modern times, great directing trick!I love the way this film looks, the styling is old, the Mexican countryside beautiful, like a slightly more urban spaghetti western.The shootouts not sophisticated, but Warren Oates makes it work as a loser with nothing to lose and little regard for his life or anyone elses after suffering another huge loss in his grizzled life."
2,Not as great as you might think,"Everyone told me that this movie was one of the greatest ever. Personally, I found it hard to follow and the acting left something to be desired."
3,"when it's good, it's good...when it's bad, it's really REALLY bad","The review that says ''disappointing but watchable'' is spot-on for the most part. I really liked 40% of this film - especially the scenes at the Father's estate when he puts the hit out on the title character - but there are quite a few slow parts between the quality ones. And I mean SLOOOOOOW parts. That and the sometimes cheesy dialogue (which I'm sure is a good point for some) are really my only complaints. Oates is hilarious (sleeping with his shades on, the aforementioned cheesy dialogue where he ends every sentence with '',Baby.'', etc.) and Vega is an incredibly likeable and talented actress for the most part...I'm surprised she didn't have more success. Basically a Peckinpah western set in 70's era Mexico with the performances making up for any outright BAD parts...C+"
3,Only Die Hard Peckinpah fans need apply.,"The only real ""enjoyment"" one will get from this film is picking Peckinpah's tired old visuals and themes of ""Bad men looking for some kind of Redemption"". And when I say there tired old themes, I mean it. Every true Peckinpah fan would have to admit that. I believe that Warren Oates is always wearing those sunglasses because he's asleep half the film (probably the first half of the film). The film's first half will definately test non-fans to the limit. It is slow, melodramatic and at some points, downright silly. But, just when I was about to give up on it, Oates finds the head of old Alfredo and the second hour kicks into gear and speeds along to its expectedly bloody climax. The ending is no ""Wild Bunch"" but at least it isn't boring."
3,Good Old Movie With a Spanish Twist,I was in the mood for an old movie so I bought it and watched it on a rainy day. A one timer for me.
1,What the heck did I just watch?,"This movie is BAD. Very, very BAD. It's like real life: long, boring, and pointless. I wish I could find something nice to say about it, but . . .Geez, is it dull. There's so many scenes of characters just sitting around and talking. I suppose these are meant to give us a glimpse of their souls, but it just comes across as meandering and self-indulgent. I didn't give a damn about the ""Hero"", or his girlfriend, or any of the supporting characters. It's just a bunch of mean, ugly people doing mean, ugly things to each other. Pointless.There is one scene that is worth watching if only for the complete ridiculousness of it. It stars Kris Kristoferson as Biff, the sensitive rapist, who gets his feelings hurt and walks away from his victim only to have her walk after him and ask him to make love to her. What the hell?Dumb characters. Dumb story. Dumb climax. Dumb movie."
1,Ludicrous,"Easily Peckinpah's worst film and one of the worst American movies of the 1970's. It marked the beginning of the director's decline into booze-and-drug self-absorption from which he never emerged. The plot is too ridiculous to merit recounting: just more of Peckinpah's Mexican malarkey. When the film came out the multi-screen cineplex was just being introduced around the country. The title was too long to fit onto the smaller marquees and it was shortened variously to ""Bring Me Alfredo Garcia,"" ""Alfredo Garcia's Head,"" and memorably ""Bring Me a Head."""
2,As bad as the Title sounds,"A third class American musician, living and working in Mexico, is hired by a wealthy Mexican landowner to physically bring the head of Alfredo Garcia, who is responsible for impregnating his daughter.He starts looking for Alfredo while helped by his girlfriend (Isela Vega), who gets killed along the way during 1 of the many shoot out scenes; Very bad photography, acting, cheap nudity and dialogue with plenty of bad effects of shootings and killings.I sure can say that this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time.I give the movie 2 stars only because of the Beautiful Isela Vega, however with the description above, 1 star should be more appropriate. Sorry."
1,Possibly the worst film ever made,"This film was made when Peckinpah was stoned while on the set most of the time, and it shows. The only thing it has going for it is Warren Oates' performance, and what he did was mimic Peckinpah, who never did realize it.Basically, this film is a waste of the viewers' time, as all Peckinpah spends his time doing is figuring out different ways to disrobe the female lead. Forget the plot, as there really isn't one.Suffice to say, if you watch this film, you'll see why Peckinpah had the final cut taken away from him on all his other films.BTW, the only reason I give this film one star is that it's the lowest I could go."
2,Item not as described.,The atI x300le 256mb ddr pci express video card is described as having a VGA port for attaching a monitor but instead mine came with a DVI port which requires a DVI to VGA adaptor inorder to use a VGA monitor. Either send me the correct Video Card or a DVI to VGA adaptor at no expense. If this error is not corrected soon I will inform the many clients I have to never use your site again because you have a sloppy shipping Dept.
3,"It works, but it is a pain in the as___","The good thing is, it works. Not much in this line to pick from. We wanted cheap and got it.Sorry, this review is so lame but it has been awhile since purchased and I just can't go into detail.We do like a stand alone unit and this one works. For the money it's ok."
3,OK product,"I am ok with the product. The only thing I am not happy with it is that it plays the ""old"" messages every time after you hear the ""new"" messages. I only want to hear the ""new"" messages."
4,Good value,"Just your basic answering machine. Very simple and easy to use and a good value. I bought 10 recently for my employer. They last for years, there's no battery and no maintenance. Never had a failure or a DOA.The settings are intuitive and you don't need the manual to use it. I pair them with low cost commodity cordless phones. Initial total cost is comparable to expensive phones with built-in answering machines, but answering machines last longer; cordless phones die after a few years, and models change every few months. Replacement phone batteries cost as much as a cheap phone, assuming you can even find one that fits. If you do, it has probably been on the shelf for years and is as useless as the original. The only downside is an extra wall wart and another cord to trip over."
1,didn't last long,I had this for a very short time and it quit working one day. Would not waste money on another.
1,Not worth the money,"DO NOT BUY THIS TV. Do you research on Westinghouse TVs before you buy. The product works well for about a year, and then convienently dies 1-6 monthys after the warranty expires. So if you want to spend hundreds a dollars a year go ahead. Not to mention costumer service is horrible, and not very accomodating to customers. To repair your TV, even under warranty, you have to pay on your expense to ship it to them with no garuantee that it will be fixed. I've got a 500 dollar TV, that worked for 13 months and died. OUr previous TV lasted for 7 years. Westinghouse is crap. And they don't care."
4,Great bang for your buck,"I got this TV specifically for Xbox360 gaming. The picture is an amazing one! Even with LCD's not being able to show the same ""blacks"" like plasma I was not at all displeased. Gears of War(one of the darkest lite games to-date) played beautifully. The graphics were amazing. I got this tv for $700 and ya cant beat that price for a HD LCD tv. I highly recommend this tv for any one thats a poor college kid like me! Only knock I got on the tv is the audio. But anyone that is paying for a HD tv should/or better already have a surround sound system. The hook-up is easy from the tv to my surround sound and it makes the subpar-speakers of the tv not even an issue."
2,Great price for a disposable TV,"I loved my TV and the deal I got for exactly 1 year. Then it began to flicker until it warmed up. Then it REALLY began to flicker until it took longer to warm up. THEN, 15 months into my experience it began moving slow...like tracers.....as if what was happening on TV was in slow motion and staying on the screen after the fact. That never goes away. So, I paid $50 per month to own a disposable TV with a 14 month life span. Now I am upgrading...and not to another Westinghouse. I am going to buy a 3 year policy too and see how that works out."
2,Approach with caution,"We purchased this TV from Best Buy less than two years ago. We ""needed"" something affordable to ""maximize the abilities"" of the XBOX 360. I foolishly did not review this product beforehand. After reading through the reviews today, I would say use caution when approaching this TV.This morning the TV will not turn on. The screen remains black. If somehow it does manage to start, it is only for a second and then stays very dimly lit, as if you are looking at your laptop screen when it is running on its battery as compared to when it is plugged into the wall.I am calling around for repair quotes and finding them to be rather expensive to start. Westinghouse will not help me at all. The TV was fabulous while it lasted, but I can't say it was worth $350 a year."
2,Buy another brand!,I received this model as a Xmas gift in December '06. It ran great until August of '07. The image became blurred from tracking problems. It initially happened after an hour of play. I've had to return it to HH Gregg for repairs which they've stated the manufacturers warranty will be honored.Still waiting for the repairs to be completed. Don't buy this model.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM WESTINGHOUSE!!!,"I purchased my LTV32W3 in January, and immediately began having random lock ups requiring me to unplug it until it would come back up. I dealt with that until the hdmi port died. Finally I decided to get warranty service. I was told it would take 3 days to process my tv and return it to me. After almost 4 weeks nothing. I've called them 10 times, and nobody there knows anything except that it is in line for processing. I've submitted a complaint to the BBB, and haven't gotten a response yet. Tomorrow I am going to the Attorney General and filing a complaint. To sum it all up. DON'T BUY A WESTINGHOUSE."
1,Didn't work,"I bought a Westinghouse LCD TV from Best Buy and it did not work from the first day. The picture froze after 30 minutes. It would not turn on without being unplugged and plugged back in. The picture quality was awsome while it was on though. I bought a Best Buy 4 year service plan and they could not find parts for this TV to service it. I returned it for a refund and Best Buy did not refund the full amount of purchase, even within 30 days! Do not buy this TV!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this TV as a Christmas present for my husband. He loved it, but now - only two months later - 1/2 the screen is black. After talking to customer support, I had to wait 5 days just to get an RMA number to ship our tv from Michigan to California (the closest repair facility) at a cost of $104.00 to me. It will now take another 3 - 4 weeks to repair and return the tv to me. I am thoroughly disgusted at Westinghouse and how they stand behind their products. I understand they have a ""Standard Warranty"", but it sure seems to me that if a television breaks after only 2 months, there should be some give in that warranty. I would never recommend this product or any Westinghouse product to a person now."
1,Worst TV I have ever owned,"I purchased this TV in August 2006. About three weeks after the 1 year factory warranty ran out, the screen started looking really fuzzy and had shades of bright greens and reds on it, mostly around people's faces. At first, it would clear up after about ten minutes or so, but now it looks like this almost all of the time. I went back to the store where I bought it at (REX TV), and was told there was nothing they could do to help me. Next, I called Westinghouse support,and was told the same thing,and that they only service TV's still under warranty. So, I have $900 invested in a TV that is barely over a year old, and I'm lucky if I can watch it ten minutes before the screen turns green and red and fuzzy. I will never purchase anything with the Westinghouse name on it again."
4,Great value,"I have had this TV for 3 months with no problems. For $850 (now lower) you cannot beat it. HD picture looks great. As another reviewer wrote, sometimes analog pictures have artifacts. For me this only occurred with the standard view and when I used the fill mode the artifacts are no longer visible. The TV speaker is a bit weak so I use extra speakers and a subwoofer. Overall I am very happy with this TV and think spending 2-3x the price for the Sony equivalent is just not worth it."
1,Buyer beware!,"I bought a Westinghouse 32W3 HD TV in 2006. One week after the warranty ran out (53 weeks later), the colormap for the display began to malfunction and shimmering colors were displayed on the screen. After determining that the problem was the TV and not the cable, and could not be fixed, I was instructed to send the TV back to Westinghouse for a new one. Two months later and I am still waiting. Once (if) it arrives, I will have a 3-month warranty, hopefully enough time to sell the unit and buy another TV from a company that believes in customer service. Never again!"
1,Dont buy it!,"I purchased this television in June '06 and began having problems in July. I contacted Westinghouse directly and was told that there was a software issue and that their repair department would be contacting me to arrange for the tv to be fixed. After a month, and still no contact, I called them once again to be told the same thing. Needless to say, I am now working with the attorney generals office to have the issue corrected. My advise...buy a name brand, you really do get what you pay for!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! FIRE HAZARD,THIS GARBAGE STARTS FIRES. MANY PEOPLE INJURED!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! SAVE YOUR LIFE!!!!!! DO NOT BUT ANY WESTINGHOUSE PRODUCTS. YOU WILL BURN ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Look elsewhere for anther ""Godfather""","I don't want to say that this is a boring Mafia book. But if you are looking for the action and drama in the ""Godfather,"" then go read the ""Godfather"" or rent the movies. However, Gay Talese's reporting skills has never ceased to amaze me. ""Honor Thy Father"" is just another proof."
3,honor thy father,"It was a little bit slow at times, but managed to hold my attention. I would, however recomend reading it."
3,Fiction or non-Fiction,A novel style written biography by Bonanno. It is doubtful if all facts are true and the fact that he could not write things to incriminate himself leave out a lot of events that happened in his life. It is a nice book which musn't be taken too serious.
3,nothing as it seems,"This is the kind of book you either love or hate. It doesn't have the same thrill and suspension such as ""Wiseguy"" and ""Underboss"", and it doesn't reveal anything new about the mafia. Certainly a disappointment. But if you read it as a piece of new journalism writing it won't let you down."
1,Dinosaurs the complete thirdand fourth season,I just recieved a second set of the dvds and this set does not play either. I have tried to play the set on two different dvd players and a laptop and it still wont play. Since its the second set of the dvds ive recieved and still have the same issue its obviously a product defect. Does anyone know how to get the disc to play? i dont think its a region issue because i bought the set from amazon and im in the US.
3,Did anyone else get faulty DVDs?,"I ordered this set on black friday through Amazon, and the one they sent me (brand new) 2 out of 4 disks did not work. They sent me a new one that I just opened, only to find that the same 2 disks are not working! Just a faulty batch? I don't know what to do now, since I'm sure Amazon will not want to send me a third replacement. I'm just going to send everything back to them and get a refund..."
5,Christmas,I liked that there was dunage in the boxes and they come together in one box. Great job you guys
5,Great show,I watched this when it came out and we have the baby dinosaur that talks when you pull the string. My 16 yr old loves it.
5,Fun For The Family,This is one of the best shows of the 90's. Added it to my library and am another set to one of my grandsons for Xmas. The kids love this and two of my grandsons are now working onn season two. Fast delivery and good quality. Very pleased.
5,Dinosaurs Third and Fourth Seasons,I was so happy to find The Dinosaurs on DVD so that my grandson could enjoy the shows with his Grandfather. Being that my husband was a big fan of The Dinosaurs and never missed a show when it was on TV. I even forgot how funny the show was.
5,One of the Best Series Ever,Truly a great television series - with one of the best finales ever. It's great to see a show have a real finale.The production values are great - it's almost as if each episode is like a mini-movie. Not just a basic television show with the same cheap set and cheap props.
5,They were thrilled!,"When my children were small, we would gather weekly as a family and watch this comedy. The dialogue was for the parents but the children loved the physical comedy. There are so many one liners they still quote to this day! (""Not the momma"", ""Again!"" etc.). Gave this series to them for Christmas and they both went nuts! It will be fun watching it with them again (at 21 and 23)."
5,"Dinosaurs, the TV show","We were very pleased to find this television series on DVD, and happy to share it with our eleven year old. Also, our twenty and twenty-five years old were glad to see them again."
5,"Dinosaurs, Seasons 3 & 4","My family loved this series, but were surprised to find that it lasted more than two seasons. We were delighted to watch these episodes, which were new to us. Good fun."
3,glad it's out on dvd,"I was so excited to be able to buy this show on dvd but when i actually went to watch it i realized how cheesy the show really is. I can't watch it! worth the money if you like the show enough to watch it in 2011, but I think I'll just remember the show from the 90s and pretend that it wasn't cheesy."
1,"Defective product, for now.","I have ordered this item and it proved to be defective. The replacement was also defective. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I intend to wait before ordering again to see if the problem with the four disc set will be resolved. For now, they won't play."
5,Totally gutted its over :(,"Hi thereI am totally gutted to now have finished the 4 seasons of Dinosaurs. The series just kept getting better and better, and before i knew it...it was over!!!!I didnt know I was watching the final eposode until it was upon me...i cried like a girl.Awesome series, disney bring it back to australian disney channel. I'm begging you, and let another generation love it as well."
4,Dinosaurs Rocks!,"This is a blast from my past. A childhood favorite of mine, I remember sitting down every TGIF line-up on ABC and watching this show. I absolutely adored it then and still do today! The plots are clever, the Henson puppetry is outstanding, and the writing is still relatable today!"
4,Dinosaurs- still funny,"For anyone who grew up watching this on tv, you will quickly return to your childhood days while watching this dvd. The quality is not so great, as it has not been picture enhanced, but it is clear enough and the sound good. The packaging is also really attractive, will make quite a conversation piece."
5,Love the Characters,Have enjoyed the series. I watch them whenever I get an opportunity. I like the fact that in each episode there is a moral.
5,Didn't know they had this,"I have love these ""guy's"" for years when my kids (and me) would watch them. I just happened to see if there were any and found them. I am very, very happy...I would recommend these series for anyone!"
5,Absolutely classic,"This was a favorite of mine wen it came out on TV all those years ago. I loved it. So when I heard it was coming to DVD, and I had to buy them. The characters were well written and acted, and the storylines were great. Each episode had a underlying story of some sort, and a message to pass onto the viewers. But unlike many sitcoms, the way it was presented was very different.As mentioned by a few other reviewers, Earl and Roy are very similar to the charcters from the Honeymooners. Whether they were modeled after them or not (pretty close), they were still different. So, to say this is a rip of that show, is vastly over simplifying things.I throughly enjoyed the show as I was perusing through the episodes, and managed to laugh at almost all of them. Other than Farscape, I cannot think of a better show using Jim Henson's puppets to this high degree of performance. The humor is still just as good today as it was then, and recommend getting this show to all."
4,Shipped very fast,"I have not tried this product yet so I could not give 5 stars, but the shipping was fast and it looks like a nice package of Peppers. I like the idea of the smaller pkg's and not the big #10 cans , it's easier to take camping!"
5,For Intelligent People who Effectively Absorb Greatness,"Dr. Susan Heitler understands depression and matters of the mind in a scholarly way. She not only is able to teach others, but has a passion in her words, that show the love for her field. I have read all of her books and would recommend her writings to everyone, whether they need help or not. Mental illness in our country is of high priority and importance. Dr. Heitler is the one who can teach us that! Don't miss out!"
3,Lacks Power,"This CD is good, but lacks power and life. I read Ms. Heitler's THE POWER OF TWO many years ago, and it changed my life, and I recommend it often, so felt that this CD might be just as stellar, but am disappointed when I compare it to the Joyce Meyer book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND FORGIVE. The CD provides a visualization technique to imagine oneself in a position of power, but there's something missing."
1,"Caution, this cassette contains no useful information","The only thing good about this innane, boring lecture is the sleek packaging the cassette came in. The only way this tape can make you feel better is to realize that you actually know more than the shrink--that may empower you."
2,"ehh, it was okay",This was filmed in the 19th century and is so old school! Its very outdated and filming is poor quality. my son still likes it but its annoying to listen to in the background as a parent. I'd find something else.
5,The Fluor Pot Cookie Book: Creating Edible Woks of Art,I love this book. I got it as a gift for my daughter but I may have to get one for myself.
1,Better Stuff for free,"Simply and bluntly put, you can find better ideas on picasaweb.com and flickr.com. I could have spent the money on more cookie cutters."
1,Disappointing,"This book was very disappointing--it is not a cookbook. It gives a recipe for the frosting and then step-by-step instructions no how to paint a cooky, which anyone can figure out how to do on their own. It is basically a book of pictures of cookies that these ladies have sold in their own business. A waste of money."
4,Great book!!,I am new with fondant icing on cookies but found it really easy to decorate the cookies with fondant instead of the usual royal icing but not so keen on the ribbons decoration. Their sugar cookie recipe is also very delicious and quite soft in texture.I recomment this book for a beginner.
2,great idea- don't need an entire book,Several people already commented about this. No real need to buy an entire book. Love the use of fondant with the cookies- attach with corn syrup and voila! But you don't need an entire book to do this. The decorating ideas are much better in other cookie decorating books.
2,Older Book,I own a copy of this book. Copyright 1901. This is an older book that is filled with old and inefficient knowledge. This book is not for the inexperienced who may attempt to use the enclosed knowledge. It is rather a book for the knowledgeable hypnotherapist who can gain a historical perspective on his craft.
5,Really good cat food,"My two are now eleven and going strong. I started both with Science Diet kitten dry and they have progressed through to the Mature Adult. Their vet has always prasied their coats, teeth, and animaton."
1,Do your research,"Cats are carnivores.Science Diet has no meat.Instead, you get cheap corn filler, spent rice leftover from brewing beer, and meatless chicken parts that humans don't eat, like beaks."
3,Not really healthy,"It's product promise to deliver good things but their ingredients can't make this happen.There are by products in this food and that's not good for your cat. If you really want to feed your cat healthy you have to get rid of this product and change to another brand that bring healthier nutrients, or try feeding your cat raw."
1,Please avoid!!,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats. Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients. They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food. This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school. Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness. Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo."
1,Look at the Ingredient List,"This food is not a good food and is not worth the money. It contains by products and lots of corn. It will make your cats fat and lazy. My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting. Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE!"
5,dragnet,I have enjoyed this collection a lot i don't get a chance too see the older dragnet tv show so it was quite refreshing too see so many episodes available of this great show.
3,Looking for a beach book?,"Jayne Ann Krentz (writing here as Stephanie James) spins wonderful romances and this is one of her early works. Although written in the '80s, the distinctive Krentz style is already becoming evident as the tale of Ariana and Lucian unfolds against a backdrop of fraud and finance in the Northwest. Unlike some of her other early books, this one features a more definitive Krentz heroine who gives as good as she gets! The sensuality level is higher with this book as well, and it is easy to get a good handle on the characters, even though at first, Ariana seems a little hard and calculating. Ms. Krentz' ability to paint in delightful secondary characters starts to show here - don't miss Aunt Phil, a real charmer! I'd recommend this as a great vacation read!!"
5,Precious... enjoyable for young kids!,"This collection is wonderful for young children. We've read this over and over again, and as they get older... your children will enjoy counting along with the story."
3,Stopped short,"While the prose was, indeed, well written, I felt as if the author had stopped short on the stories that made up this book. It dealt with different experiences she'd had, which was really interesting, BUT everytime I felt myself getting into it, the plot would shift directions I was left hanging. This is especially true concerning the part where a ghost from Louisiana leads her to something that has been hidden; I wanted to find out more about the ghost and the hidden object, but that didn't happen."
4,3 Dylan albums in one package!!! Wow!!!,"One great Dylan album (""John Wesley Harding""), one good one (""Nashville Skyline""), and one of his most eccentric (""New Morning""), all packaged together at an unbeatable low price (well, I suppose a lower price would be even more unbeatable but, hey, they're not gonna sell it for $5).The rating applies to the cumulative reaction of listening to the whole collection as if they were one big production or something, which, as you well know, isn't really the case now, is it? Individually, well, it's a whole 'nother story, fellas. JWH deserves five stars, NS merits four, and NM makes do with three and a half. But, hey, that's only my opinion. It's not as though I'm God or anything. Bless you, anyway."
2,Disappointing and tired.,"I anticipated this book would have useful and immediately applicable elements to do what the title suggests, incorrect. The book is written in a ""hey were all cool, play using the fingers you want...""kind of language which in no way makes the long tracts on the history of sound etc any less boring. There are supposed to be casettes ( which in 1984 when the book was first published is reasonable I suppose) to use in conjunction with the book which surely could have been updated to be put on a CD for inclusion with the book rather than subsequent purchase ( does anyone still have cassette players??). In all, this book is tired and needs complete revising and updating. Your money is better spent elsewhere, a new set of strings for instance."
2,Great to balance your chair out!,"Lots of physics stuff that isn't too useful. Confusing chord charts(edge gets a bit dull after a while), not worth the money."
1,not a very good product,"this product is not worth $75, the picture is terrible, it skips constantly then shorts out if you even move it. Also you have to get the video seperatly and they cost alot of money and since they are in PVD format you can't play it on anything else. the screen is so small and the unit is so big that it is ridiculous and not good for the eye sight. If you have the extra money get a real portable dvd player like a Sony, Panasonic or toshiba. You will notice a big quality difference and you will save some money because all the discs for the video now ad up quick and by the time the machine dies, all that money will go down the toilet."
4,Buy it now while you can.,My nephews have this and love it. It's also helpful for parents in the car to keep the kids quiet. They now can watch their favorite cartoons whenever they want and wherever.Get it now before the Christmas rush.
5,Video Discs Are Hard to come by,"For Christmas, I bought 2 players and 4 Video Packs for my 6 & 7 year olds and they love them! Now heres my complaint.. When I bought these players there were loads of Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents Videos as well as many others that my children enjoy to watch, now there is nothing but Dora and the Wiggles World and a few sports videos. If this is all thats available now, im going to be highly outraged. I too payed alot of money for these players and all the accessories that were needed and hope it wasnt a waste of money."
5,Pretty pewter frame,"This is a nice frame. It's heavy and definitely suggests quality. The lines and edges are smooth. It's detailed and has a lot going on, so it definitely will be eye catching even amongst other frames, and also looks good just on its own.The finish is definitely more pewter and not at all silver. That's fine with me - but just wanted to clarify for anyone wondering."
5,Very Good Quality!!,This picture frame was delivered fast. It is a heavy frame and is very good quality. I will be buying more in the future!
1,"I hate mine, too.","I've had nothing but problems with mine. It's been in the shop 3 times and is now out of warranty. It chokes randomly on certain disks...just can't read them. It's slooooooooow.I expected a lot more from Onkyo, and am bitterly disappointed. At least they stopped making it."
5,Onkyo DVCP701 refurbished,I bought the refurbished player with 1 year warranty for $99.The picture is wonderful and sound blows you away. This player will also play DVD+RW (not mentioned in specs) and my SVCD movies.
1,horrible,"i have two onkyo receivers, and they are great, but this is a very unreliable onkyo product,,the remote will not allow you to move between scenes , unless it is in the right mood, the dvd's jam, many will not play,,,so i thought it could be a cd player only,,,surprise,, only 3 of the 6 slots actually work,,the remainder are not recognized or jam,,,i am now looking for another multi disc dvd to replace this. the newer onkyo products get good reviews, but this is such a disappointment, i am not taking a chance on any onkyo player."
1,Its o.k I guess ...So far,"Mine had pixelating problems at first. but after a complete reading of instructions I found you can reset the chip by holding the stop button in for ten seconds until it reads ""RESET"" on display. Has not even flickered once since and I play DVD-R's for 4 to 5 hours at a time. If you buy this get the longest extended warranty you can.Honstly I would rate this at 4 stars but for some reason I cant get the stars to change on this page."
3,Kind of outdated,"I think when this book came out, there was almost nothing known about Nell Ternan. But since I had already read the Slater bio, I felt a lot of the ""info"" in this book was redundant (non-sequentially, of course). Still, it makes for rather interesting reading, but nothing conclusive issues from it. In any case, you learn a lot about actors' lives at this period and about how Dickens presumably managed his double life (not to mention Collins and other writers who kept mistresses and alternate families safely hidden away).An enjoyable read full of fun period details, but somehow, you come away a bit disappointed once it's all over with. And frankly, I found Nelly to be the least interesting of the sisters, and without Dickens, of almost no interest at all. Go figure. If you're a Victorianist, sure, read this book; if not, you may not really care about the Ternans and Dickens."
3,A feminist view of a Victorian affair,"The story is one of those feminist renditions of history where where Nelly Ternan, Dickens' kept woman, is made into a great love of Dicken's life with some, albeit little, effect on his fiction. Unfortunately the Ternan connection does not work well, and only shows that while everything had an effect on CD. no one can claim to be The effect. As for Nelly, she is a nice woman who history passed by. While she may not have had the effect on Dickens that Tomalin hoped for, her story is interesting because she was an actress and her story shows how Victoriana treated them and more importantly how entertainers lived on the edge of society then (and now in the midst of it as now). It is also of somewhat sad that nothing of her letters to CD and his to hers reamin, and a sad note that whatever she learned of CD is lost to time. BTW, Kate Redding does another good job reading. It's a slow book but feminists may be interested; traditionalists would not."
4,Great show but poor recording quality,"That's what it is. But I already knew it before I bought. So you should know it too. However, for those who love the Blues it is a must have! Even aware of the quality I bought it and I am very happy with it!"
1,very bad dvd,"This is a poor transfer of that 1987 show with Albert King, Etta James, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Paul Butterfield, and so on. Everything is bad in this release, poor audio, poor video, that horrible cover. Even the menus are painfull, you just can't even read some song titles. I have also the original videotape and it's much better than this."
5,It's NOT Too Late for James Morrison!!,"James Morrison's rendition of Carole King's forty year old hit ""It's Too Late"" is such a great remake, it should be on his next album!!!I saw the Morrison's rendition on ""You Tube"" two months back. Apparently, UK's ""Q Magazine"" had ""Take It Easy: 15 Soft Rock Anthems"" as an ""extra CD"" for one of its issues about five years ago.The CD has great remake's of hits of yesteryear.The above song is by far the best rendition of ""It's Too Late"" that even Carole King would give kudos for a job well done!Just look for the CD on Amazon or any on-line store!"
5,The perfect Heart collection,THis Heart Cd collection is one of the finest in exsistence. The only heart album it's missing is Dreamboat Annie. But other than that it is essential
4,coach deck,"Great idea something easy to take to the field. The drills are a lot the same as you can get in any drill book, but they fit in a pocket. I think they are pricey but i'm not unhappy with my purchase."
3,Not a favorite,"Oh, there's nothing wrong with it, but my nieces ignore all attempts at audience participation and it just doesn't interest them. *shrugs*"
4,Hannah Montana: 2-Disc Special Edition Soundtrack,This is for a 9 year old girl. She loves it. There are some cool photos inside that look like polariods but there not and Hannah aka Miley signs them. Nice surprise for my daughter inside.
2,I love the CD but..,"I love the CD but I should have just bought a new one because the seller said it was going to come with all its original artworks, but it didn't. I'm really disappointed because I love the artwork you get with the CD."
5,Excellent,This album is better than the 2nd one. This is the house favorite! this album is more suitable for smaller kids.
4,Great Buy!,"Great product...The best feature is the WiFi, and after the software update download you are set with e-mail and more great features.Pros: Great battery life, great size screen, enough memory to carry enough music, WiFi, youtube link...Cons: Limited access in some webpages, can't download some features in webpages, no bluetooth capability."
5,It's a keeper....,"I was looking for an MP3 player and after evaluating a few I checked the Touch. I am glad I went with it because of the added features like internet connectivity and multiple other apps like mail, weather, contacts, maps, stocks, YouTube. I have to be honest, I use it more for these other things than I do for music. I have even retired my windows based pda because the Touch does everything I used the pda for. And the Touch also will transparently syncing with Outlook so my calendar and contacts are also there. When I am not at home where I have wireless connectivity I don't have to go far to get connected. While on vacation last week I was able to connect at every hotel/motel, restaurants, a library, a bank etc. I can't imaging being without it."
1,Loved it while it lasted......,"My wife bought me a 8GB for XMas and we exchanged gifts on Wednesday prior to the holiday. I loved it....worked great!!!! I went out and bought a protective cover for it, a screen protector, and an FM transmitter for the car. Everything worked great and I told my wife it was one of the best gifts I've gotten. I love the whole setup. Well the thing went blank (white) the next day to my dismay--2 hrs wasted downloading iTunes, picking out my songs, etc. plus now I have to go back and return it. Tried all the advice on the internet about the ""White Screen Of Death"" but no matter what I tried, it wouldn't turn off/work no matter what I did. Hmmm...if I wanted a faulty product, I'd buy something that was made by Microsoft. Well back to Best Buy to get a replacement!!!(I know all products have some random bad apples so heres to hoping this was just an isolated solution.)YRMV......"
1,No Windows XP/Vista 64 Support,"As it turns out, the iPod touch and iPhone do NOT work (at all) with any 64 bit Windows XP or Vista. The box clearly states that it works with XP and Vista, but it turns out that was a gross overstatement.Be warned... you may be buying a gift for someone that they can't use!"
1,Bad Apple!,"The newest generation of Apple's ipod Classic has been a bunch of trouble! The first one had a never functioning back light (hard drive problem- no hope there) the second one stopped working after two weeks of no apparent problems. Combined with the, I'm not kidding, hour wait to get through to technical help and the seriously rude phone help (not all, just one really ""bad apple"") and the whole experience has been disappointing to say the least. Apple store at the Grove in LA played our knight in shinning armor with an easy exchange for a new one. The first two were engraved for Christmas, we gave up on that and went to the source. Much easier than the phone hassle.Let's hope that three's a charm!"
2,Cool features - Aweful audio = Zero quality,"Sorry I will have to make this short. Ipod touch is not the mp3 player you want to have for listening to music. I just wish apple could spend lot more time on sound quality than wasting their time on fancy looks or extra features. They forgot the little machines are supposed to bring music!Ipod touch was such a dissapointment. I could not even start on how bad (or say mediocre) the sound was when I try to compare it with other mp3 players. It just wear me out soon after listenning to a couple of songs.If you are paying money for your favorite music, try Sony A810 or Iaudio series. You will see what i am talking about."
1,was sold a broken iPod Touch,"i was sold a broken iPod touch. the ""off"" button didn't work. i was also given a manual for a different model. however i was refunded for all expenses eventually."
5,The best ipod ever,"Certainly it is the best ipod ever. Not only does it play music and videos, but it is also a workstation where you can keep updated about what's happening. With a fully-functional web browser, an email application and a notes applications (these last two with the software update), this device helps you easily maintain contact with corporate systems and colleagues.Besides, the graphical interface is wonderful and the touch technology is simple wonderful to use."
5,It's like a flawless computer!,"It's Great! Lets say that if you don't have a lap top or home computer and all you need is email, full internet, music player, videos, note pad, calender, maps and so much more. It fits in your pocket. I would suggest the rubber case cover and the clear film to protect the screen. Protect it right away. No problems and I have it 1 month. I find that when I need to go and check out something on the net its much faster then starting the computer up to check the tv guide or google something. I would tell tell you I have had pda's and they cannot compare. The big ""m"" has a lot to watch out for. Go APPLE GO!Happy User!!!!!!"
5,IPod Touch Review,"In a word really cool. I just love this device. I use it to surf the web, listen to music, watch movies and videos and listen to my share of podcasts.The multi-touch interface is very cool. The only things I have against it is that my finger are just to big for that tiny on screen keyboard, but given the size there is not really much they can to there. Also I was a bit upset that I had to pay $19.95 for the google apps, but they were worth it. One additional complaint is the lack of bluetooth and the difficulty in finding a set of bluetooth earphones that are small and lightweight for it. I hate wires and in the cellphone world we have moved to bluetooth headsets, but in the mp3 world we seem to love wires. Anyway, the IPod touch has the coolness factor all over it. It tempts me to replace my Blackberry with an IPhone."
3,Fun Gadget....but not much different,"I have purchased the Nano, 30gb Video and shuffle in the past 15 months. I received the Ipod Touch for Christmas this year as it was on my list! What I like about it is the functionality of the controls, size of screen and the wifi. Overall I really like it however, the wifi isn't really that great because unless you have wifi where you are it doesn't really matter. When I am at my house it is fine but I could just be on my computer. If the price was better I wouldn't hesitate to buy it but for $399 you could get a IPod with larger space. The screen is great but I have had to remove some of my music off what would be on my Ipod Video. I have 5 movies and 2000 songs on it but can't include any pictures as I am pretty much tapped out on space. If you really want the larger screen which I think is worth it go for it. But at the end of the day you could buy an Archos and a larger (space wise) ipod instead."
5,Apple iPod Touch 16GB,"I love my iPod!! It is an all-in-one gadget! I especially like the fact that it is very user friendly, it has a large screen and it is wi-fi capable. The high price tag is well worth it, for me. Although, I am not usually a gadget person, I never leave home without it! Now, if it only had a camera..."
5,Love it!!,"Bought this as a gift for 'myself' so that I could put training material on it, and half the time I can't find it because one of my kids is using it! Great product and graphics. Quick delivery. Would definitely do business with this vendor again."
3,Mine went back,"I returned my Touch after one day because I realized that the Wi-Fi store is not set up for podcasts. Podcasting is an essential feature for me, and if I cannot do it wirelessly on the Touch I can just stick with my old Ipod. When they add podcasts I will try again. Maybe the next generation will be better."
2,OmG!!! I simply cannot get i Touch To work,"Having bought the Nano...and 4th Generation Nano... they work great but now...with the i Touch It has been a night mare for I Tunes to pick up the I Touch.I uninstalled....reinstalled....uninstalled...reinstalled and have spent 8 hours so far to get this thing to work on I tunes.Checked updates,,,checked security software and still not working...yet the Nano works as well as the 4th Generation.Poor service and feedback so far....So if you are willing to spend forever getting this thing to work.....good luck...Anybody else that has figured it out.. please call....I did the 5 R's 3 times and it still will not work."
5,Fantastic product,"I bought these for my girls (10 and 13 at the time)for Christmas two years ago. I had bought them Zens the prior year and they hated them, they weren't compatable with itunes. So I figured I wouldn't cheap out and I got them the real deal (it was the only present we got them that year and it was all they needed). I thought the itouch was just an ipod, I had no idea what this product really was. It is almost like a hand-held computer. They can access the internet when in a wireless or wifi area. Unfortunately, there is no internet access other than that. Anyway, after two years they are still using these things on a daily basis. There are all types of games and applications that can be downloaded. Some are free and some cost usually less then $10. Anyway, best purchase (according to me) and best gift(according to them) I've ever given."
5,everyone should have one of these,"this is technolgy at it's finest, didn't want to spend $400 for the phone, so I got one of these. It's the exact same thing, except no phone. It is fantastic, even at the price, all the features are first rate, I love it, it's great."
5,THE VERY BEST,"There is no gadget this Holiday season that outdid this purchase. I gave it as a gift to my husband and he has not put it down since he got it. Excellent web features, picture features and overall an excellent product. Highly recommended for anyone who likes gadgets."
4,Hack the ipod touch,"When you know how to hack into apples software you can go places only the iphone can take you on the touch. I have three pages of apps on my ipod/touch that were intended for the iphone ONLY!!! Don't listen to apple, your ipod/touch is well worth the buck, once you explore the impossible. Without the hack, stick with your old ipod."
4,Enjoyable device,It's a enjoyable device with so many functions and easy to use. The touch-screen is a big innovation. The only particularity is the easy to stratch manufacture materials. Case should be more self protective.
4,ITOUCH 16GB,I love my Itouch. It is like your own personal computer with you at all times. I only hate that I can't have wireless with it at all times. Being able to keep your pictures with you at all times is great! Good product...get it!Apple iPod touch 16 GB without Software Updates
4,Good one,"It is an good one. I buyed after reading other reviews. it is good for 500 songs, 2 movies and photos.Few weeks later i purchased it, its price reduced by 11$.look out for good deals. i bought for $270"
2,No 3G No 4G,"This is a no brainer for people living outside the US. The US is so far behind in cell phone tech they don't even know that this phone is so last century. I have an iPod Touch. IT's great. But I will NOT buy an iPhone until it's 3G - at least. And guess what: in Europe, Asia and Australasia its 3.5 or even 4G (HSDPA)!Americans don't even know how far behind they are....This is sad."
1,Itouch defective,The Itouch I recieved was defective. Bad battery. I'm still in process of replacing it.
2,Big Deal Price,"I think 400 bucks is way too much for this thing.The music album is real showy and impresses your friends but that's about it.Keep your regular ipods and save your money.The Safari system works very rarely.So all that flashy BS like Utube,stock quotes,weather don't work.I've had mine for a year and take it everywhere in Portland Oregon trying to access the web and I've found three places.Two Doctors offices and right in front of an Apple Store in a mall.Ya real neat-o.It doesn't work in public WIFI areas and it doesn't work at home with my system.So I spent 400 bux to dazzle my friends with album covers.What a joke.Apple is NO help either.This is very last ipod of any type I will waste lots of money on."
5,Wife loves it!!!!!,"Bought this for my wife last xmas 2007 and wife just loves it!Highly recommned buying, keep in mind to buy a screen protector immediately as well when purchasing as we did. No problems!!Lot's of functions!!!!"
5,iTouch.. I like very much...!!!,"(English)This is my first iPod and I am very happy with it. It's extremely fast and their functions are enough to entertain for a long time. Wi-Fi is perfect and fluid, the sound is clear and videos are glorious!!!. Highly recommended for those who want a portable entertainment center.(Espa√±ol)Este es mi primer iPod y estoy muy contento con √©l. Es extremadamente r√°pido y sus funciones son suficientes para entretener por largo tiempo, el Wi-Fi es perfecto y fluido, el sonido es claro y los videos se ven gloriosos!!!. Muy recomendado para el que quiera un centro de entretenimiento port√°til."
2,IPod touch 1st generation,Ipod was fine for two weeks then it stopped working. I can no longer connect to wifi. When I try to get on the Internet the iPod says debug console. All of my other devices are working like my iPhones but not the itouch.
5,Excellent product!!!!,"great deal, wi-fi, video, clear audio and with new upgrades it becomes even more perfect."
5,Apple iPod touch 16 GB,"The purchase was successful from the first moment that the transaction to acquire the same.In general terms I am very pleased with this purchase of the Apple iPod touch 16 GBMarvir ContrerasLos Teques, Venezuela"
5,Excellent,"Excellent image quality, it's like the Iphone without telephone, only bad thing is the limited memory, you can not expand it"
4,Ipod touch 16GB,First impressions were good and I am still impressed. It is easy to use although the touch screen takes a bit of time to get the hang of. I-tunes is strange and I still don't like it or the fact that it is the only way to interface the ipod. Apple need to loosen up a bit and let people have some freedom!
5,great buy,"This is definitely the best iPod ever made. The icing on the cake is the price, you won't find a better price than the one they have here at amazon, and trust me, I searched. With free 3-day shipping included, what are you waiting for?"
4,Good multipurpose wireless device,It's a good wireless multitasking device which is loaded with revolutionary features. It will be a good platform to develop into better versions of wireless multipurpose devices. It has the potential of being a great device of its own category. Few features like external volume control and a camera are missing.
5,Awesome New iPod,"Apple's newest iPod is really great. It has internet, youtube, photos, video and even iTunes. The most surprising thing about the iPod is that it's REALLY fast for such a small gadget. The iPod touch works much in the same as previous iPod, but it expands on the features.The downside to the new iPod Touch is that it feels fragile. I would never want to put it in my pocket because I would be too afraid to scratch the screen or even break it. The ipod itself is super thin, which makes it easier to break.The iPod touch is a great new iPod, but if your looking for something you can rough up a bit, try the iPod classic or nano."
1,Broken,"When I recieved this item, I turned it on, and the screen was completely green. I had to turn it in to the apple store..."
2,Depends on what you want...not what I want,"I don't actually have one but have seen other's. It is not for me, and whether it's good for you depends on what you want. I am a very basic user. I have the Ipod classic 60 and that is enough for me. I don't have anything but music and I have about 1200 songs on it and still have plenty of room. It works great and hardly every freezes. The wheel works great. And it has playlists, something the Touch doesn't have. I love setting up playlists and changing them. I would really miss it. So before you get the touch I pod, you really need to consider your needs and wants. I absolutely love my ipod classic and can't imagine trading it in for the latest technology just because it's there."
5,Success!,My 12 & 15 year olds love it! This made my Christmas buying much easier this year and I found it at the lowest price.
2,ipod touch has too many problems,"This is one of the most amazing electronic gadgets yet conceived. Sadly it's not ready for prime time. There are too many problems. I had two of them and both had major issues. One had a bad screen and the other wouldn't load. As far as I'm concerned two tries with a product is enough. Hey Apple, next time you release a product you may want to be sure the majority of them work properly. Especially as $399 a pop."
5,awesome gadget,This is the coolest gadget I've ever owned.It does however drive my girlfriend mad when I play with it hour after hour!The touch feature is probably the best part of the product. The review is btw written on the iPodTouch!!!
4,Well... what can i said... so cool!,"I only want to say that yo have to check the apps out, on the Apple website there are many applications for your ipod touch, you can turn your ipod in a flash light, a wi-fi finder (you need are connect to internet), play hangman, chess, make a grocery list, find almost anything near you, a better weather info or use your ipod to control remotely iTunes player or Windows media player... you gonna need time to check all this apps out but to me was pure entertainment.cons: the camera and external speaker will be great."
4,good choice,"I have bought this as a present for my dad, and he absolutely loves it. He hasn't quite grasped yet everything this iPod can do, but he enjoys finding out and 'playing' with it. He is a big opera and classic vocal fan, and has just downloaded a Cecilia Bartoli DVD to his iPod Touch, and enjoys watching it and listening to it during his train commute to and from the office."
2,WHAT?,"Why the heck are so many people drooling over this thing? Seriously! Luckily I don't own one but my close friend of four years does and trust me, I've toyed with it for long periods at a time making a serious attempt at finding out why someone would cash out !!$400!! for a sixteen gig ""touchscreen iPod! Is that why people want this? Because when you touch it, it goes to a different page? The new nano has each and every single feature this player has, except for the internet which itself cost a monthly bill, and the nano is $200's less! PLEASED! I am not biased but DO NOT WASTE YOUR EXTREMELY HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS! If you want a nice and sturdy touch screen device, get the iPhone which is SO MUCH more worth your money. TAKE MY ADVICE! GET A 3RD GENERATION IPOD NANO and a SONY PSP! That way you get all the feature this mere sixteen gig device has and it would COST EVEN LESS! Or better yet, get yourself a 160 gig classic which is 50 dollars less."
1,16GB??? Is Apple kidding???,"Apple really screwed this one up with only 16GB, when last year's top of the line had 80GB and now the classic has 160GB."
1,Ipod Monopoly!,"Once again, everyone pays way too much for nothing. I wish I could sell 16gb hard drives for $400, LOL!"
2,30 day returns even at Christmas.,Itouch was not set up for text messaging. Not compatible with my granddaughters computer. Returns allowed no lea way foR Christmas so I had to return it.
3,I got what I paid for,You get what you get when you buy something refurbished. Refurbished DOES NOT MEAN IT'S NEW!!!!! It's super glitchy but it plays music and that's why I bought it.
3,got for my daughter,"I chose this one because my daughter was wanting one for xmas.. she is 10yrs old and doesn't know then difference in the expensive ones and older ones.. I checked it out after I received it everything seems to be working right, sound etc. we will find out more when she opens it for xmas.. Thank you to the seller.."
5,The best iPod Ever!,"I had this iPod for almost two years (until it got stolen). I always have wanted an iPhone, and this came very close. I love its style and how it combines music, internet, and fun apps. This is a huge recomendation to anyone who wants an iPhone but can't get one due to stupid AT&T. I miss it a lot."
5,Unbelieveable!!!!!,"We bought this for our 25 year old daughter and we're incredibly impressed with it. Our daughter has loaded TONS of music into it as well as videos and still has TONS of room for more. The screen is a great size and crystal clear, and I think the coolest thing about the iPod Touch is the way you can flip through your albums with a swipe of your finger across the screen. We have wireless internet and she has had no problem at all with connecting, and the viewing of webpages is incredible! So many things about the iPod Touch are amazing, but I'd have to write a HUGE review to cover them all. If you can afford the price, buy one. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Great for what it has,"I have had my Ipod touch for about a month now and I am very satisfied. It is really cool in the fact that everything is done through your touch and is very enjoyable.PROS:1. Music, Video, and Photo work great and are really cool.2. Graphics are great.3. Internet works great with the Wi-fiCONS:1. While everything it has works great, it doesn't have much more than that. The thing is there isn't much more. I would expect some accessories or stuff to do while I'm playing my music but without access to the internet there isn't much to do. There are no games to install. One could jailbreak the ipod but that's very risky.2. While it does have link to itunes, but you can't download like podcasts or any free music onto your ipod. You to listen to music from other websites and there is no way to download.3. It ain't cheap.If you have the money and you would like a flashy iPod have fun!"
1,Became deffective in less than a month.,"I bought the iPod touch 8GB for my wife less than a month ago and I am returning it now due to defectiveness. The iPod simply does not charge anymore. The charge icon comes on but it never charges as before. As per their technical support instructions I tried resetting the defaults via iTunes, but it craps out in the middle of the update with an ""error 9 occurred"" leaving the iPod in ""Recovery Mode"" and unusable."
3,IPOD Purchased from Amazon,"IPOD is great, but I will purchase from Apple store next time I need accessories or another IPOD. I did not get the IPOD until 3 weeks after I purchased it, and that was after several calls to Amazon and UPS."
4,I can't believe I found it!,"My primary goal with this CD was in owning the song ""Quolli"" written by Pierre Schott and Asma Debbiche. However, it also gave me introduction to a soulful one-album-wonder named Mikaela. Apart from those two artists, percussionist Rony Barrak & pianist Michel Fadel present a fun track from Barrak's second album, ""Karizma"". I don't desire to insult the other artists but, in my opinion, those are the main tracks on this compilation that stand out. I'm happy to have it!"
1,Ugh,"If this is typical of the average author that White Wolf lets portray their Werewolf: the Apocalypse setting, they're in big trouble. I was completely revolted at his utter lack of basic biological knowledge (and his assumption that his readers are just as ignorant), and his narration of the football game scene left me completely lost, since the narrator assumes you're an avid football afficianado and don't need anything explained. There was a certain lack of suspense, the plot moved like a two-toed sloth, and I had no particular emotions for any of the characters. Don't waste your money on this drivel. If I could rate it with zero stars, that's what it would have gotten from me."
5,Season 1 was good...season 2...Outstanding!!!,"Since I missed most of season two, I could only judge the first four episodes until I recieved the second season from amazon. It arrived on time, and in grea condition. I like the packaging for season two better than season one, as every disc has it's own holder, rather than putting discs on top of discs. The show is amazing, and gets even better in season two. I can't wait for season three of the american version to come out. I'd recommend this for anyone who has gotten addicted to season one."
5,Being Human... a story to hold one's interest,Wonderful storyline... terrific actors.Very suspenseful with many surprises along the way...Very imaginative writing... gives a feeling of reality to a fantasy.I would reccomend this series to all of my friends and relatives!
5,being human,"This was every bit as good as the british version! Indeed, certain parts flowed better than the UK. It needed a better ending though, or should have been continued rather"
2,Being Human season 3,Havent gotten it yet but I do reccomend buying it. What else to say I thought this season was wonderful since we got to see there indival monsters and how they dealt with them. Oh I didnt dislike any of the new characters except for Nora which she is now a regular which I dont like.I give it two stars since the DVD is not out yet.
4,Trollope is Trollope,"I have spent the last 30 years collecting Trollope and trying to find his less popular works. He is my favourite author from his time, and that includes Dickens who, for all his virtues, I find maudling. This book is one of those one cannot put down, well plotted although it has all the usual Trollope landmarks - so the question is, how is it one can continue reading book after book of this author, never get tired and always be surprised?"
4,Walked the Tight Rope Well,"It is a tricky assignment to write a story based on a game and still be relevant to the rest of the expanded universe. Mr Dietz did a pretty good job here. Kyle Katarn, which is available as an action figure, is the guy that steals the plans to the death star. Considering that I had already read the Han solo trilogy, (My favorite trilogy in the EU) where Hans first love dies leading the decoy team, I thought it worked.The art work was uneven to me. Some of it was sharp and germane to the story. Some of it was soft pastels that I just did not care for. And none of the artwork matches Dorman who does the third and book in this trilogy.I really liked the format for the illustrated novella. I wish there were more."
3,"""High Noon"" in outer space","Although the plot is rather simplistic - an old-fashioned, shoot-em-up Western transferred off planet Earth, and the special effects are dated, ""Outland"" is still worth a look, and Sean Connery's worth watching any day, even in yet another tough cop role. Three stars for a classic."
4,"Futuristic, shoot out at the OK Corral","I specifically watched this movie to analyze its special effects and props as viewed from 1999. It is interesting to note how trapped movie makers are by the current state of technology. The interaction by Sean Connery with the computer and the lighted display of the impending arrival of the shuttle were typical of computer technology as of 1980. It is interesting to see how much more ""user friendly"" computers are today. I like to view these ""futuristic"" movies and reflect on how close to reality they are. At our present pace, it does not appear that we will be mining Io by the year indicated in the movie. As an aside, quickly review the movie ""2001"" and note how unlikely it is that we will be enjoying space travel to the moon by that date; what a shame."
3,Outland - the movie,"I wanted to see this movie because I really like Sean Connery, and my husband read the book and wanted to see the movie. Husband says the movie was not as good as the book. I was not sitting on the edge of my chair like when I first saw ""Hunt for REd October""."
3,Great Commentary Track; Otherwise ?,"(As I am having problems with my Blu-Ray player -- the Aspect Ratio is messed up), I cannot really tell if the picture is indeed 2:35 to 1???Other than that, I bought it through Amazon.com, as it was cheaper than my store. Of course, Peter Hyams's commentary track is really good."
4,"""High Noon"" in Space.","Sean Connery while he still had it. Decent production values/effects although effects only backdrop in this movie, not focus. Interesting space-based ""High Noon"". Worth a view."
2,"Slow, Slow, Slow","I wanted to like this movie so much. I love Sean Connery. I love outer space epics. I love lone man against hired guns movies. I hated this movie.I couldn't believe how phenomenally slow this movie was. The dialogue was just very mundane. I can't remember a single scene that stands out as good. It almost felt like you were watching a small group of really dumb people trying to think of something to say about a topic they neither knew or cared about every time two people ended up speaking to one another.The big finale' with the mercenaries showing up to kill the sheriff was just a non-event. Can't people think of cool ways to kill bad guys in the future? Nothing in this movie clicked for me, and I really tried to let it work. If I was given this DVD, I'd never even unwrap it."
1,"Great Movie, terrible DVD","After reading all the bad reviews on the DVD quality, I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. The only copy I had was an old VHS copy I made off an over-the-air broadcast 25 years ago.THE OLD VHS COPY **LOOKS** ***BETTER***.I hope they eventually remaster this great SCI-FI movie and produce a Blu-Ray version."
4,Still looks Excellent on a big screen TV.,"Hard to believe that this movie made 22 years ago still holds up but it does. It is a dark movie, lightingwise, but on my HD big screen TV it still looks great. Sean Connery is superb as the loner Marshall aboard a space mine on a moon of Jupiter. When the bad guys find that they can't control him, which means ignore his duty, they send assassins to kill the marshall. Connerys only friend is the spacey doctor...Some had called it slow moving, but the tension that builds helps to emphasize the hopelessness of the situation. This is also a story of doing the right thing instead of drinking the koolaid for the party or the company. The values taught in this movie are slowly being obliterated, so admire this marshall that takes a stand and that others must obey the law."
4,"""Outland"" has great acting...","This movie deserves more credit than it's been given by critics. There is great acting in it, which is often overlooked. The movie is really about Sean Connery's character coming to terms with himself. Will he continue to be just another guy doing his job, or will he risk his life and his family by trying to take down his boss? The acting is really what I remember the most from ""Outland,"" not the sets and special effects. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, which is always good.The bonus features on the DVD are good, not great. However, the trailer is one of the best I've ever seen. Very suspenseful."
1,Yup - 'nother release of the same garbage transfer,"This gets more and more interesting. They re-release the same old unacceptable quality DVD yet again, Amazon deletes the old reviews, and those of us that care about this film come back here and tell everyone that this is a good story but the crawling, shifting, pixelated transfer to DVD will give you a headache. If you really want to see this entertaining story - buy a used one for the lowest price you can trust. You will enjoy the story but be disappointed by the view. You won't play this DVD often because of the way it was mastered. I would give it four stars if the DVD were even acceptable."
3,Worst DVD transfer I have ever seen!,"This is a perfectly good movie, should get 5 stars (or at least 4), but I have never seen a more horrible butcher job of a transfer before in my life. It's grainier than a bad VHS video, I can't believe these people actually released this without cleaning it up first. Glad I only paid [...] bucks for it at BigLots or I'd be raising holy h*** about getting a refund.+5 (or 4) stars for the movie, none for the digital video transfer (if that's what you can call it). -kd5-"
2,Outland,"A gutsy Connery confronts corporate greed on a Jovian moon mining colony.Not one of Sean Connery's most successful films, it is a must-have for sci-fi buffs. Unfortunately, the widescreen transfer is sub-par. Thin horizontal lines, horizontal edges of objects, and stars wink in and out of existence when they pass across horizontal scan lines and due to film jitter. Although noticeable at first, this defect becomes less noticeable as one watches the video.Until a better transfer is available, it is still a ""keeper"". This 3-star film gets two stars due to the transfer problem."
3,Not Exactly Out of This World,"This film is a mess on dvd, with dirt and frequent artifacting marring the image. By no means a classic, but a film of this size and scope from the Eighties should look a heck of a lot better than this. Sturdy performances elevate director Hyams' lunar HIGH NOON."
4,"A decent movie, but needed some help","The best part of this movie is obviously Sean Connery, who does a fine job in a fairly routine role as the lone good guy fighting the many bad guys. I also liked the look, even though it is the grungy look perfected in Alien. The exterior visuals and special effects are not very good, looking very much like models. I take one star off for that alone. Overall, a good rental but not one I would buy. 3 and 1/2 stars in my book."
4,"High noon, yes. Other aspects rarely covered are there too.",I spent a year on a Pacific island. This movie more than any other gave the same feelings of isloation and boredom of workers in a trapped environment. It was a good job of gritty reality under probable circumstances. You'd have to do it.
3,"Good movie - could have been a great movie, but it is what it is.","I saw this movie years ago and for some reason, I never could find it listed on cable over the years. I saw a DVD version which was dark and grainy, so for $10, I took a chance on this Blu-Ray. The movie is intentionally dark, but the picture seemed sharper, with less grain on the Blu-Ray transfer. For $10 or less, I recommend it."
1,Bootleg quality dvd,"First of all, let me say, that I really do love this movie and I will talk more about it below.However... this is by far the worst quality dvd I've ever seen. I didn't know that picture quality on a dvd could even get his bad. The picture is grainy, and just plain terrible (see other reviews who will say the same thing!) Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before I bought it, and I paid the price. DVD Quality 0/5 starsSaying that, I still love this movie. Those reviewers who said it was high noon in space are exactly right, but it is also mixed with 1980s paranoia about the morality of private companies, and fears about drugs. Sean Connery plays the character of the Marshal excellently, as to be expected, and the movie is entertaining throughout. Movie Quality 4.5/5 starsOverall I would recommend waiting to buy this product only after it is rereleased and you see some reviews saying the picture quality is better."
2,A great movie that screams for remastering,"I'd read the reviews, I consider myself forewarned about the quality of the DVD, I never expected this, they should be ashamed of charging $15 List for this, I'd feel like I was paying too much at $4.99.When the theatrical trailer actually has better quality then the movie presentation, it's a sign something is wrong. The menus are 100% better looking then the quality of the movie itselfThat being said, this is a movie I've been meaning to get back and rewatch, and the story, the plot, the action, was all as good as I remembered, but WB owes those of us who bought this version free copies of the eventual remastered version that someone needs to have made."
2,I just picked this up - Buyer Beware!,"Although it is nice to see this on DVD, the transfer is not very good at all. Worse yet, it is NON-ANAMORPHIC widescreen!! In this day and age, folks, that is unforgivable. It wouldn't be that big an issue if the packaging didn't claim ""Widescreen, Enhanced for widescreen televisions"".COMPLETE BS. If you have a widescreen TV, you'll have to zoom the picture for the proper aspect ratio. With the grainy transfer, the picture is pretty awful if you have a large screen."
1,Warner Bros. Sucks.,"This a pretty good flick, not great but watchable. The DVD, however, stinks. This was one of the first DVDs released in the mid-1990s and over ten years later they still haven't done a decent remastering job on this. They just repackaged the DVD with a new cover! They even say that this is ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"". It's not - it's just letterboxed. This is basically unwatchable. In fact, with all the juddering and shimmering it's worse than VHS. Avoid."
1,Package Specs Are Incorrect. It is Letterboxed,"In this day and age, why any studio would release a letterboxed version of a film on DVD, instead of an Anamorphic one is beyond me. The original Amazon specs indicated, as does the actual DVD package that it is enhanced for widescreen tvs, which isn't the case. When you pop in the DVD, the little tiny letterboxed version will be right smack in the middle of your 16X9 television. You will need to zoom in to fill your screen--or just chuck the DVD in the garbage out of pure frustration as I did."
2,"Great Movie, Horrendous Transfer",A- For the movie itself. A fine hard-science film in the Alien/Blade Runner traditionsF- For the transfer. It's as if someone recorded it from a TV broadcast on SLP VHS and then transferred it to DVD at the lowest bitrate possible.My advice? Wait for the studio to fix this inexcusable travesty and then buy the inevitable DVD or BD release
2,Good film gone to bad copy!,"Outland is a very good sci-fi movie and, for its time, a breakthrough of a sorts. Frances Sternhagen as the doctor stole the show. (The part was originally written for a man and was not changed when she was cast, thus making this role, in 1981, a new concept as a role for women).In spite of being a fairly good movie, the DVD version is awful!!! It is covered with ""snow"" and the characters and background scenes are jerky and bouncy throughout. The letterbox version is so small that even on a 52-inch TV, it was difficult to see.If you can, wait for the Blu-Ray... maybe they will do a better job then of transferring it so it is watchable!"
2,High Noon in space,"This is an excellent film, even though it steals it's plot from the 1952 Gary Cooper film, ""High Noon"". It is a very good adaptation of that film, with good character development and fine performances. That it takes place in a future possibility of a mine on Jupiter's moon Io is icing on the cake for any SciFi aficionado. Special effects are of a high standard, and the music score is top notch, perhaps one of the finest ever.That being said, the DVD transfer is awful. The picture squirms continuously, colors are muted, the image is grainy, and the aspect ratio seems to be somewhat ""crushed"" in the wide screen version. I have to say this is the worst transfer to DVD I have yet encountered.Any SciFi enthusiast needs this film in his or her collection, but I would advise you to wait for a remastering of this film. It is a very good film, and well deserves special treatment. Perhaps a Bluray version is worth the wait..."
5,Enjoyed Again For the Umteenth Time,"From the movie theater, to the Laser Disc, to the Prime video stream this movie just never seems to get old. Great effects and all done without CGI. You can't go wrong with a Sean Connery movie either. This is the way movies aught to be made."
1,"DVD ""Outland""","I ordered this particular DVD the first part of June 2011,,, to date I have not received the DVD, or any emails about it up until this ""Review"" email... What happened ??"
4,an extremely well made Sci-Fi thriller,"I don't think that Sean Connery is capable of giving a bad performance. In this film he is surrounded by a wonderful cast that includes Frances Sternhagen, Peter Boyle and a host of character actors that will have you pointing your finger at the screen and saying, ""Oh, I know him...he was in....""! The story is great and the special effects are amazing for that time period. The home run though....as one would expect....is Sean Connery. Anyone who could make ""Zardoz"" watchable has to be a great actor. This is a dark and wonderful film to be savored by Sci-Fi junkies and by suspense thriller junkies."
1,Agreed - worst DVD EVER,"Great movie, remember seeing with high school friends it at the Cinerama in downtown Seattle when it came out in 1981.The DVD itself is an absolute disaster. I could only watch about 2 minutes of it, skipped forward a couple of chapters to verify the whole disc was that bad, and then threw it into the trash. It is truly not watchable. This is the only DVD I've see that is worse than VHS.Let's hope the remake will cause WB to spend a the time making a decent Blu-Ray of this movie."
3,Pretty good cop story in a sci-fi setting,"It's unusual seeing Sean Connery in a film this old where he isn't a dashing undercover agent, but he's pretty good in it.On the whole, it's not a bad movie. It's just that it doesn't...sci-fi well. You can take all the elements of the story and set it in an urban setting and it'd pretty much work the same way. Yeah, it takes place in space, but it's not like people are being used as pods to farm alien life forms, or that machines are becoming so sentient that they are hypnotizing workers to kill themselves. Nothing like that.But it's not a bad movie."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"This is one of those movies I watched on a whim. I caught this on Prime streaming so no comments on the DVD. Overall, not bad. The acting, dialog, and characters are passable, but the sets, atmosphere, and production value is top notch. It's essentially an old school western in space, with the sheriff trying to lay down the law against the local saloon owner / outlaw.With that said, overall a good experience and worth my two hours. Not very deep but highly entertaining."
5,Outland,"This plays as a western, but works very well as a sci-fi. Blue-ray brings out so much more of the movie sight and sound. I usually only upgrade to blue-ray from DVD tha best movies I like. Outland was one of them, enjoy, Drvon."
1,Poorest mastered DVD I've ever seen.,"Movie, one of my favorites, but I'll keep my laser disc copy. This is the worst DVD I've ever seen, There is not a single frame that doesn't have at least one of every type of video problem that there is. To be honest it looks like a VHS version. Stay away from this DVD."
3,A disappointment,Not too interesting. I thought there would be more of a variety in African Music. It does not.
5,"Deeply touching, a MUST-READ!!!!","This is without a doubt Christopher Pike's most emotional novel. It wont simply captivate you it will steal your heart. A major tear jerker. But don't get me wrong, this book is not about death. It's about everything but death. It's about life, love and compassion. I'm a longtime fan of Christopher Pike and this is absolutely one of his finer works."
3,Okay.,"Honestly, in this book the characters take turns telling a story every night. I thought their stories were very interesting and way better then the actual story of this book. In fact, I wish I could have heard more from the short stories these characters told. It was kinda sad but I felt kinda let down by the ending. It was a decent read, but not something I'd ever read again."
4,Solid read,"This book is basically about a group of teenagers in the hospice, but the story isn't so much about these teens as the stories they tell around the table in the group they have dubbed 'The Midnight Club'The stories they tell are actually creative and enjoyable - one about a girl and the wish she makes that results in a clone of herself - the angel who becomes human, and a story set in India amidst the caste system. I really liked this book, it was a lot of fun and remains one of my favorites though I lost my copy many years ago."
5,A book that touches the heart,"This is the first book that I read that made me laugh, cry, and truly think about those that I love. The best thing about this book is that it doesn't just center on one charcter, but many. The reader gets to know each and everyone like they were your best friends. This book was definitly the best to date and I highly reccomend it."
5,Excellent!,I Love all of Christopher Pikes books but this one was the best i have ever read. It kept you in suspense right up to the end. I liked how you had stories within the main story as well. The ending was very good and suprised you which is good because it's good not to know how it will turn out. Books like this are good when they are unpredictable
5,A Lover of Christopher Pike and R.L. Stine,"This is the best book I've read in a long time. This book makes you cry and think about your life, and be happy being healthy. This is Christopher Pikes best. He put in so much soul that I could feel myself there. Not a lot of books can make you cry and feel grateful at the same time. You should get this book if you want to feel like you are a character of the book, but you're not named as a character in the character's lives."
5,It journals death,"Honestly, this book has not much to do with the caption that graces it's back. While it does follow the lives of young adults dying at a hospice, the first dying member doesn't bring the remaining grief. While the caption may mislead, the book is still great. You will find yourself engrossed in the characters, they are wonderful. While the book isn't much horror, its still great, I suggest it to anyone, not just Young Adults."
5,One of the best books Pike has ever written!,This book was the first and only book to ever make me cry. I have read it many times and will never forget the feeling I got from reading this book. A must read for any Christopher Pike fan.
4,Pretty Good.,"I'm kindof into the spooky stuff (that's why I read Christopher Pike) and when I started to read and found out that it wasn't quite what I expected, I was taken completly by surprise. It was a great book but I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I had known a little bit about it ahead of time and hadn't been surprised like that"
3,Not what was promised,"Christopher Pike is one of my favorite authors, but I was a bit disappointed with this story. The story itself was a good one, but readers should be warned that it's NOT a typical Pike book. It promises supernatural events, but doesn't come close. It's a wonderful book about human relationships and love, but it's not a thriller. If you're ready for a good cry, go ahead and read it. Otherwise, pass on to another book."
1,The work of a sick and twisted mind.,"""Whenever you look at him, it looks like you want to..."" This quote ought to give you an idea of the tact this book takes. Disgusted, we didn't bother to finish it. The story seemed to be about one thing: sex. The gratuitous sexual content in the book truly disgusted us. If you have a copy, tear it up in little tiny pieces. We did.Christopher Pike has a dirty mind.~~~~~RaRa and SaMara~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
5,Excellent Reading!,This book was the best book I have read in a long time. It really shows the pains that people who are sick must deal with. I loved it even more because of the bit of a love story it contained. I will continue to read Christopher Pike's books because of this wonderfully told story!
3,For die hard fans only!,"I had heard this was the best Pike book ever. Wrong! First off,I think it's over-rated. I think books like Monster and Scavenger Hunt are better and under-rated. I reccomend these. I also reccomend The Last Vampire series and Whisper of Death. The Midnight Club is still an okay story despite the back of the book lies and there is pretty much nothing supernatrual about it. Read MONSTER!"
3,a horrifying tale of a different kind of world,in a hospice somewhere a group of cancer infected children are undergoing therapy. a different kind of therepy. They get together at midnight and tell horrifying stories to relieve stress. As some of you may know a hospice is a nice place where people go to die. when a Midnight Club dies they attemp to ressurect them in this great tale.
1,Self-indulgent drivel,"Troubled and manic, always begging for attention. There are many other baseball memoirs more worthy of the time and expense."
1,Short Lifespan,"We bought this 8 months ago directly from Wine Enthusiast and was happy for a mere 8 months. In the heat of the summer, it suddenly stopped cooling allowing our sulfite-free organic wine to climb to 78 degrees. This is like your freezer suddenly failing and all your meat thaws. Sulfite-free wine will not last in warm temperature so we were very upset when all our bottles were suddenly at risk. It did survive the 6-month warranty, but not by much. If you have valuable wine, don't trust this unit."
1,Motor quit after 14 months,"The motor died after around 14 months. Wine Enthusiast would not replace, as it was past the 12-month warranty. I searched a few online sites, and have seen several reviews with the same problem. I would not recommend this wine cooler, though it is small and practical, it is cheaply made."
2,Doesn't last long...,It was easy to set up and it worked great for about 13 months; then refrigeration stopped working.How do these places do it? One month out of warranty and done. Saw the same circumstances in other reviews of this product around the web.Wish I would have looked for those before getting this unit.
1,FTC should investigate this company,"After 2 1/2 years, my wine refrigerator (this model) stopped working. Their customer service department told me the heat sink is bad, the refrigerator can't be repaired, the warranty is only for one year, and the only thing they could do for me is give me 10% off a new refrigerator. Literally, the only thing I could do with the old refrigerator is to throw it away.Amazing. I'm not in the habit of throwing out appliances after 2 1/2 years. What a shoddy company. I also cancelled my subscription to their magazine, since I figured their poor quality extends to that as well."
1,Great while it lasted!,"This worked great for about 18 months, then just died. The worst part is I have to pay $25. to have it hauled away. My son's dorm refrigerator was cheaper and is running great after 8 years."
1,Looks like I am not alone,"Lasted about 13 months. Now just sits in the space that we custom built for it. Lesson learned..and no, W.E. don't want to hear from you!"
1,Nice looking Paperweight,"Looks pretty, doesn't function. If you want cold wine buy another brand. This lasted about a year and the wouldn't get colder than 55. Now to figure out how to dispose of it..."
1,Hope you like warm wine....,"This refrigerator like the previous person said, ran and never stopped running. Well that is wrong it ran and then it stopped running after 19 months. I would not recommend this product at all. Save your money. You can find another brand for less money and still have chilled wine! I am not WHINING but this is not worth your money."
3,Should be reissued in proper form,"Finally the 7 Steps Box Set got it right and released the concert as performed, rather than arbitrarily edited to a ""Ballads"" and ""Other"" disc. The concert should be reissued in proper order, for those who do not wish to buy the 7 Steps Box."
4,Surprising fierceness in these standards,"""The Complete Concert: 1964"" album has a surprising edge to it, given Miles & Co. were performing standards. This was 1964, after all, and Miles had yet to break most of the rules of traditional acoustic jazz with albums like ""Nefertiti"" and ""Miles In The Sky"". Here, the band plays with unusual energy, relying on the sophistication of the songs themselves to supply the ""cool effect"" needed in jazz and going for broke. Drummer Tony Williams is in peak form here, sending the band through some sped-up versions of their repetoire. A great moment in the Miles Davis catalog."
2,"The Music is without equal, BUT > > >","Sorry, but i just can't recommend this. Of course, the music is fabulous, but we've known that (and it has been easily available) for 40 years! ""Complete"" is not true, and ""Concert"" would imply that we were hearing it as it happened, which we are not. Columbia should have treated this disk, which they call a ""Jazz Masterpiece"" as if it actually was a masterpiece. And it is."
5,A Director's Wizardry,"This film was enormously popular in France, so much so that a few movie houses played it simultaneously. Just about everything in the film is fake and deliberately so. The ""jungle"" was shot in an airplane hangar and the non-professional actors spoke in untitled Japanese. The director, the great von Sternberg, explained the actions BEFORE they occured so that the audience could savor the fabulous visuals. And it was shot in black and white. The plot is simple, the camera work has to be seen to be believed, and the music is missing. This is definitely THE director's film throughout and well worth viewing.Curtis Stotlar"
3,"fun read, but lacks the Charming ""soap opera"" of the series","The Charmed Ones meet up with the mischievous spirit from mythology, Puck, who sends them to the circus to save an innocent: an elephant. The animals are being killed by a mysterious demon, but Phoebe, Piper, and Paige are more concerned with the mysterious and troublesome antics of Puck. The Charmed community has a treasure in the clever and talented Paul Ruditis who spins a well-written spin off with twists and turns while being faithful to the series. The only problem is the story itself is pretty boring, without the soap opera drama that balances the demon-of-the-week stuff of the series. Leo is completely absent, too. Only the truly, deeply faithful Charmed fans should go for this one. Grade: B-"
3,Great message but...,"I agree whole-heartedly with Gussow's message, but for some reason I just couldn't picture her home and garden from her descriptions. My mind's eye drew a blank when I tried to imagine the scope and scale of where her house was sited."
3,A bit disappointed,"I was hoping for a lot more organic gardening information. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said this book could have used some good editing to help make the content more concise, especially regarding the building the new house parts. It seems to jump back and forth and repeats much. Gets tedious at times."
5,amazing book,"This is the best book I have ever read, period. The recipes are wonderful; some dishes are the best that I've tried in a long time. Dr. Gussow herself is warm, witty, kind, inspiring, and concerned. I was disappointed that there wasn't more as I finished the last chapter."
5,So good we bought another for a friend as a gift.,"Down-to-earth, poignant, and humorous book that any gardener or even non-gardener would enjoy.Information given can be applied to any gardening endeavors, regardless of the location of the garden."
2,Misleading title,"I bought this book because I thought I was going to gain insights about organic gardening. I was sorely disappointed. The beginning chapters drone on and on about a move to a new home site...I grew tired of hearing detailed descriptions of the doomed home. Also, while the author went on about eating locally to lessen the impact on the environment from long distance travel, I was disturbed to hear about the home she bought being leveled and taken to a landfill and to hear about her endless trips back and forth between her old home and new one. Finally, I was disturbed by her chapter dealing with animal drownings and killings and disagree with her statement that ""if we don't kill animals, we will starve"". I'm sorry I spent the money on this book."
2,Caution! She is obsessed.,"I checked this book out from the library after seeing many good reviews. In it her son says, ""You're obsessed with growing food."" and she is. She even puts her dead husband's ashes in the garden! To me, that is a bit much. Also, she is not a vegetarian, using blood meal, bone meal and manure on her garden. This book is short on vegetarian organic gardening information. I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
4,"Great ""second"" carseat.","Our son does not mind sitting in this carseat. I like that it turns into a booster seat later and for now we just use it as our second carseat (although it's become our primary carseat lately). The only two negatives about it are:~The bottom of the 5 point harness system is not too comfy on his legs/between the legs.~If he ever falls asleep in it, there is not much support for the head."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"After loving our Evenflo titan carseat for its comfort, ease of use, etc., we are VERY disappointed with the generations booster seat.Positives: not much-- Fairly easy to strap child in-- CupholderNegative:-- Seat Cover: Ridiculously difficult to remove and wash-- Head Rest / Restraint: Does not support sleeping child AT ALL. Our daughter is left to basically ""dangle"" and sway as the vehicle moves.We are looking for a different car seat as we speak."
2,Terribly Uncomfortable,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. I have had good luck with other Evenflo car seats so tying another model was a no-brainer. However, I have been very disappointed with this seat. I agree with another reviewer who said the harness tightening knob is very hard to turn because it is pretty much right up against the seat of the car. My fingers get stuck between the knob and the seat when trying to turn. Probably the biggest reason I dislike this carseat is the comfort. The way the head rest is positioned, it actually makes my daugther's head go forward a bit instead of either just straight back or reclined. We travel a lot and there have been many times she tries to fall asleep but ends up crying in pain due to the way the seat forces her head forward. There is no possibility of resting the head back or even to the side. We've had this seat a few months now and I'm definitely going to call it a loss and get a new different one."
2,Don't buy this if you like original recordings,"This 3 CD collection has a pretty good selection of hits, even though there are many more of The Hag's hits that aren't included. The only problem I have with it is the fact that all of the older songs are not the original recordings. They are remakes. If you like that sort of thing, then that's alright. As for me, however, I only like the original recordings because those are what I fell in love with through the years. Therefore, I feel I wasted my money in buying this set. It looks like the only way to get all of Hag's hits with original recordings is to buy the ""Down Every Road"" box set and ""Yesterday's Wine (1981-1988)""."
3,You're better off buying the originals,"Though this collection contains most of Hag's best songs, they are not the original recordings. I bought this collection thinking they would be the classic recordings that have been loved by country fans for years. On most of these song's, Hag's voice sounds weak. When you listen to some recordings that were made even more recently, you'll find those are better than the recordings in this collection. Maybe Merle was sick when he made these recordings or something. However, this collection does have great songs, and is certainly worth listening to."

4,Good book but no color pictures.,The info in this book is good. It gives directions and GPS info and other good info. BUT in this day and age there is really no excuse for just having black and white pictures in this kind of book. In black and white all the rocks look very similiar to me. If they would just add color pictures I would rate it 5 stars instead of just 4. I still recommend this book but not as your only one for this area. Get it to compliment others.
2,Outdated and no color pictures,"This book was written in 2003. Many of the sites listed in the book are either closed or have changed ownership. One mine has changed owners twice since the book was written, and now charges $30 a day, not $10 a day, to dig your own dirt and use the sluices. Beware those changes, and know that there are no color pictures in this book, but there is still some useful information in the book."
5,A WONDERFUL GUITAR FOR THE MONEY!!,I just purchased this guitar package and all I can say is BUY ONE AS SOON AS YOU CAN FIND ONE. This guitar should easily sell for at least $700.--BY ITSELF! The guitar has an on board WT-92 preamp-tuner(very accurate) along with a spruce top with mahagony sides and back and the detail work on it is simply OUTSTANDING!! You also get a padded Washburn gigbag along with several pics and guitar strap and an instructional cd. I own a couple of other really nice guitars but I can already tell I'll be playing this one more often than the others in the future. You can spend a lot more money and get a lot less guitar but why would you?
4,Your kids will love this book,"Chrissy, the daughter of Santa, was always told that you have to believe in something bigger than yourself, but that statement was put to the test one day when Christmas and the North Pole was taken over by Exmas Express, a big business that would change Christmas forever and not for the better. When the big day came to deliver the presents the snow was so bad, the Exmas Express trucks got stuck and could not leave the North Pole and Santa had put on so much weight from his bout of depression that he could not fly in the sleigh so it was up to Chrissy to believe that she could deliver all the presents on her own.Santa Kid is a book that any child would love because it reinforces the fact that ""kids are small, but kids are smart and kids are the ones that know how to believe."""
5,great,I order a new Christmas book for each of my siblings families every year. This book was a hit with the older and young nieces and nephews.
1,Ho-ho-wholly uninspired,"I took this book out of the library, and found it painful to read. My son was fairly interested, I admit, but the concept is not so much the problem-it's the prose. The sarcasm in the attempt to make fun of Santa's ""job"" has the opposite effect it intends; the only sentences that seem to land are the ones questioning the plausibility of Santa's work. The main character as many have written here, is thin, and sappy; it seems like a book that was sketched out to be the basis of a third rate kid's movie, with the undeveloped stock characters and cardboard dialogue you'd expect in that genre. The attempts at adult humor which drive the plot are forced and unoriginal. Santa Kid could have been much more, but it wasn't. And I agree with the reviewer who thought the poster ""gift"" in the back of the book is quite lame."
4,Decent Microphones,"As an independent filmmaker, I was interested in a wireless lavalier system. For the price, the microphones get the job done. The quality is great, but not the best. I like the feature of multiple mics on one channel. My only gripe is the receiver is so large. That's a minor issue though. If you're looking for a quality wireless lavalier set and you're not ready to spend the money on a sennheiser system, this is a great option. It was a blind buy for me because the reviews were so scarce, but I'm satisfied with the product."
5,Works well,Used it now for 4 outdoor talk-shows. Works well on a 60 feet range (did not test for more). It has some professional level features so I would rate it semi-professional devise. Good deal for the price you pay. The lapel mics are OK but not that good in very noisy or windy outdoor environments.
5,Lifes Principles Bible,"I love reading the Bible and this is a wonderful study Bible. I love how Dr. Stanley starts with telling the theme, the author, the time, and the structure of each book plus so much more. It's wonderful. I plan on buying four more to give as Christmas gifts. I highly recommend this Bible"
5,One Of The Best Bibles You Can Get!,"Wonderful for reading, the notes and Life Principles flow easily with the Scripture giving supportive thoughts to the already reliable NKJV Translation."
4,An Encouraging Bible,I have been using the Life Principles Bible for a solid 18 months now and use it for my daily readings. Charles Stanley's comments help to calm my mind and focus on feeling the Word. Whether this is the same for every reader I cannot say but as my first Bible Stanley's comments have helped me to engage my mind in the Word of God.
2,size incorrect,ordered size 13 they were clown shoes at least 3 sizes too big.ordered size 12 after sending those back and again too large.i normally take a sizeb 12.5. these shoes are missized when made.i have now returned both pair and give up. I'll go to the store and try them on first!
4,Giogrio Brutuni shoes,"I brought two weeks ago and the lace already broke as tied to go dancing.I worn these for a dancing shoe.Mostly I wear Stacy Adams carlos or Perez style.I will reccomend this shoe to those who enjoy dancing in tap,waltz,quick step."
5,"Pure Listening Pleasure, Over, and Over, and Over","Very few female artists would I dare listen to on CD--a cappella in a room with no other sound--Regina is certainly one of them (as is Anita Baker, Stephanie Mills, Whitney Houston, Denise Williams, etc.) What beautiful vocals she lends to any musical sheet, with such crisp, clear, inviting, soulful and lengthy acoustics that I wish I could trade places with her. Truly a plesure to listen to, and I do have all of her CDs. Do not miss this array of extraordinary & diverse singing talent."
5,An Excellent Book Explaining Nationalism in China,"This book is one of the best academic books that I have ever read. It is clearly organized and well written. It lays out its methodology and its interpretation of the difficult concept of nationalism, which is like many books based on Benedict Anderson's ""Imagined Communities"". It is a very descriptive as well as objective book of nationalism and the forces that create a national identity. It compares China to the Soviet Union and Taiwan and comes to the conclusion that Chinese nationalism is opposed to democracy.Another person who has reviewed this title did not even read this book (or failed to understand the text). The quote mentioned actually should read: ""Chen Xi recognizes nationalist fears of the USA, but opposes them, making use of nationalistic emotions to carry out an ideological war against the USA."" The book also contains far more text than is suggested!"
