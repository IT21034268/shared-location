4,A Very Good Oz Read,"Shanower continues in the tradition of Oz writers with a classic adventure story. A woman who guards an apple tree (which keeps the magic of Oz alive - if the apples are eaten, the magic dies) is having trouble protecting it from a man who wants to steal the apples. It is classic Oz, presented in comic book-style, meaning there is less than no subtext. There is only a problem when Shanower tries to work a moral into this magical if not original tale, something that Baum swore never to do. Yet, it is still good, and a nice addition to an Oz lovers book collection."
4,Graphic novel written & illustrated by Eric Shanower,"Introduction by Harlan Ellison. Graphic novel (quality paper, comic book format, colored illustrations)."
3,Sparse AWB means thin-sounding show,"In 1973 AWB released a much better live album, ""Person To Person"", which this record strives to fly in the face of 26 years after their prime. With a group almost half its size, this show gives us a band that knows tha songs and has the chops, but lacks the wall of sound a full complement used to bring to these tracks. When you hear 1 person trying to sing the chorus of ""Love of Your Own"", it just doesn't ring true.Nice try, but the older one is one of the best live albums there is, not just the better live AWB record."
3,diverse,The book gives good examples of landscaping styles! A great resource if you are planning a classic garden.
5,Eyewitness has done it again!,"The Eyewitness series of books has finally found its way into fiction. This is not only the story of Black Beauty, but the sidebars and background information needed to fully understand the text. Parents....if you take the time to stop and tell your child what a word means, or explain what a stable might look like, you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE this series of books. I assist in a school library, and these books are a hit with our students!"
1,Bizarro bad!,"I was hopeful upon seeing the 5 existing reviews of this film, but was severely disappointed upon receiving and watching the movie. The movie starts out strange and eerie and deteriorates into a bizarre mix of bad characters whose motivation for their actions make no sense. Purchase at your own risk."
4,Snowshoe Routes : Washington,"My wife and I snowshoed for the first time this past winter - now were hooked. This book is a great resource for locating good hikes. When it is raining during the Seattle winter - grab your shoes, this book and head out. Your sure to find deep powder and a great trail. Well worth the money!"
4,A nice resource for either the novice or the expert!,"This winter I went snowshoeing for the first time, and this was the guide that I used. Nelson provides a helpful resource for those searching for a nice trail or a backcountry spot to take on during a nice winter day. I found his directions and descriptions both informative and fun. If you live in the Northwest and own a pair of snowshoes, or want to try it for the first time -- as I did with a few friends -- than this book is well worth the cost!"
3,Routes should be modified to accomodate avalanche danger.,"The avalanche considerations could be emphasized. The Northwest Avalanche Center (nwac.us) provides a new avalanche, snow pack and weather analysis every day at 6:00PM. This information should be referenced and used to provide cautions about the routes that should be avoided for different levels of avalanche danger."
4,Great reference -- could use an update,"This must be the definitive mass-market guide for snowshoeing in Washington, which is great. Tons of great hikes and useful info.My only wish is that compared to recent guides, it's a bit outdated with hand-drawn maps and it could use a little bit better structure. Fortunately a lot of the content is up on wta.org, too!Don't hesitate to buy this book if you're serious about snowshoeing in Washington -- it doesn't get much better!"
3,"OK, just not great","This tea was tasty, but not great. I've had better loose leaf (although not pearls), but I've lost that supplier. Guess I'll just keep looking for a more floral, smooth tea."
2,"Great tea, but have found human hair sewn into the pearls, twice, two different shipment","I love this tea, it's great and great for the price but I guess you have to live with the lack of quality assurance. I normally would give this product a 4 or 5 stars, but because of the two different time I have receive human hair sewn into the pearl, I find it unacceptable."
2,loaded with perfume,"I purchased this tea once in the past, probably at least one year ago and liked the product very much. I just reordered and something is seriously wrong with the new tea. I opened the package and there is an intense artificial smell of jasmine. It seems like a bottle of perfume was poured into the package. I brewed tea twice. The first time seemed tolerable. The second time, in fact, I threw the tea away. I won't buy this tea again."
2,Those other good ratings are misleading,"First, this tea smells like synthetic jasmine. Purely chemical induced. Secondly, once you let the tea sit and become room temperature, it begins to change its smell to something like urine. I hate to leave such a poor rating, especially saying that it smells like urine, but what else can I do? I love jasmine and drink it solely, everyday, but this is probably the worst tea I have purchased. I guess you have to look at it this way. If you're going to pay such a small price, compared to a pound of tea elsewhere, then you can assume that the saying you get what you pay for is going probably be true. In my opinion, it is in this case."
5,"Great tea, great price!","After much experimenting, I'm a totally devoted fan of Rishi Teas but I make one exception and Numi's Jasmine Pearls is it. Jasmine pearl tea is my favorite tea, hands down, but as any jasmine pearl lover knows, it ain't cheap! This tea is a great value AND tastes good. I defy anyone to find a better deal on GOOD jasmine pearl tea!9-30-09I'm dropping my rating to 3-4 stars. I've been drinking Rishi Tea's version of jasmine pearls recently. I just opened a new bag of Numi's jasmine pearls when the Rishi ran out. The difference in fragrance is dramatic! I can barely discern any jasmine aroma if any when I opened the Numi bag. The Numi tea tastes good, even sweet (did they sneak in a hint of sweetener??) but this is jasmine tea after all. I think I'll bite the bullet and pay the extra $$ in the future for Rishi's jasmine pearl."
4,Price is right!,"For the price you really can't beat this. I've had better jasmine pearls, but they were much more expensive. I'm pleased with this product and it's price enough to continue wanting to purchase more."
4,"Good, not great.","This tea is pretty good, but definitely not the best jasmine pearl tea I've had.Unfortunately this is actually only ""jasmine scented"" according to the package itself.I do appreciate the fact that it is organic tea, and the taste is good.For the price, the tea is a good purchase, but I would suggest spending a little bit more and getting a better tasting tea."
2,look elsewhere,"This is not the worst Dragon phoenix pearls I've ever purchased. To be fair, it's the second worst. It may have been good or very good (for the money) at one time. I'm just not sure what decade that was. This tea had little to no jasmine scent or flavor.It seems very old.I contacted Numi and they're replacing with tea from a different lot. If it is good I'll update, but for now avoid this tea. I wish that I had."
4,Strong jasmine flavor...can't beat the price,"The jasmine flavor is strong but make sure you use 180F water temp to really extract the flavors.For the price I can't complain. The 4 stars is for the look and feel of the ""dragon pearls""- they don't look nor taste ""fresh"" like other brands. I've compared many different brands and even though I think Rishi is expensive, I'll be buying it due to the Freshness and better taste. I don't dislike the Numi tea, just not my first choice, perhaps my "" I'm on a budget but want quality tea"".BTW- you can steep both brands multiple times ( I found 3 to be the max) per 8 oz cup- flavor will be lacking more each time you steep but it's still there."
4,Great value,"Not the best tea that I have had, but much better than any other one that I have been able to find in the US. This tea has a lot of Jasmine scent that continues to give through multiple steeps. When the pearls unfurl you can see that the leaves are very fresh. Also the tea is powerful enough that you do not need very many beads per cup.One issue I have is that when steeping there will be little particles that come off. It is not a terribly large amount, however it is more than the better teas. The other issue I have is that when opening and closing this bag to get the tea, you're letting in and out a lot of air, reducing the potency. You should put a certain amount for your daily use into an airtight container to reduce the # of times you open the bag.All in all, this is a very good value and I do recommend it to anyone, and everyone, that enjoys tea. Since it is in bulk, spread the joy by sharing with friends and family."
4,Quality Tea,"I would recommend it. Quality pearls and a few make a strong, tasty tea. I have bought the Numi Loose Leaf ones which is cheaper, but it's not worth the saving. Buy this one and you will have quality, aromatic tea."
5,The Portable Abraham Lincoln (Penguin),"I bought this book for a Political Science course at my university. My university's bookstore charged more for this particular book, so I was relieved when I found it on Amazon at a more reasonable price. The book arrived at my mailbox in time for the start of the course. I have kept the book and am happy with my purchase."
3,"Very Good product, muddy production","Ok, so imagine if Korn, Deftones, and Stabbing Westward got together and recorded an album, you would have something very close to what Hospital can do by themselves. They have produced a very fine tuned album musically. Having a Nu Metal type sound, mixed with plenty of gut wrenching hardcore screaming. The only beef i with with the album is the vocal production. It sounds like they only leveled their mics for the screaming and not the singing, the guys singing voice sounds underwater and the music can easily overtake it. The funny thing is, is that this problem seems to correct itself towards the end of the disc. All in all a very good album from a band that probably nobody has heard of. Lyrically they seem to deal with emotional problems and stress, yet the lyrics all have a very stong Christian undertone. A good buy, especially for a ten dollar album."
3,Very Talented But Poor At Putting It All Together,"Good CD, these guys can make music. However, they dont put it together right. They Also need to clean up their vocals. So so mix.If you like wild screaming solidstate buy it.If you like heavier thicker metal Check out OIL (www.oilmusic.com) or if you like more melodic with better leads check out pillar (www.pillarmusic.com)"
3,Its fictional...hello!,"well, Cisneros is not an outsider, he very much a part of the tribal community. And most importantly the book is fictional. I thinks its good that this topic is finally written about in any context. His tribe and many others are not strangers to political corruption by thier tribal council members. One shoulndn't be so nieve to not believe that this could happen."
4,fiction or exposee??,"After reading this book,, which is supposed to be fiction,,I wonder if a lot of it is really an exposee of the Kickapoo tribe of Kansas. There are a lot of things mentioned that have happened out there that are in the story line of the book. and if the native americans from that reservation take offense,, maybe they should look into their hearts and realize maybe he IS trying to help his people,, by opening their eyes ."
1,Why!?,"This book depicts a story of an outsider always looking in! This books portrayal of the people is NOT a truth, rather a personal view. Hypocrisy, lies, vengeance are the motives behind these tales. This is the saddest attempt to publicly decimate and humiliate his own people by writing this book. I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone!"
5,Excellent stuff!,I might be a wee bit biased because I'm Irish but The Frames (sometimes listed as The Frames DC [Dublin City] because of some other crap US band with the same name) are amazing. Nobody else can mix rock music so well with an instrument like a violin. Revelate is a classic. The video was recorded in a Dublin post office for the price of a video cassette to put in the security system.. Desperate measures for a cash strapped band. The record is a brilliant second record. Recorded 4years after their extremely rare debut it is far better. The title track Fitzcarraldo is my personal favourite - I've seen them live a few times too and god do they put on a show! Buy this CD!
3,Decent album but didn't hit me like Glen's solo work,"I'm thinking that, like Glen Hansard, the Frames really shine the brightest in concert. I just saw Glen a few weeks ago open for Eddie Vedder and he (Glen) blew me away. I immediately got his current solo album and this one. I liked the solo abum better. This one was just alright. There was nothing new or catchy in it that stood out to me after listening to it about 3 times. I will continue to listen to it here and there, but it is not on my favorites list. Like I said, his solo album was better, but it still was no comparison to watching his energy live. I had never heard of him before, but his spirit was contagious."
4,One of the Frames' best!,"FITZCARRALDO is, plain and simple, a fantastic album. After hearing live versions of several of the tracks on the superb SET LIST, I knew I had to have this album in my collection.Every track has something special about it. The title song alone makes the album worth owning. There is so much going on musically in ""Fitzcarraldo"" that I all I could do was sit and listen with my mouth open in amazement. ""Revelate"" begs to be danced to, ""Evergreen"" boasts a surprising guitar riff, and you'll find it hard not to sing along with ""Angel at My Table"" and ""Denounced"". Fans of ONCE will recognize the stellar ""Say It To Me Now"", presented here in its full electric version. ""Your Face"" is a beautiful, mellow tune that ties up the album well.FITZCARRALDO is an album that begs to be listened to over and over. For those who are new to the Frames, this is the perfect place to start. Seasoned Frames fans...for heaven's sake, why don't you have this album yet??"
4,"Beautiful Art, Lovely Poem - a review of ""Momma, Will You?""","Momma, will you wash the pig?Yes or no or maybe?In the tub! He's not too big.Wash him with our baby.[Fortunately the answer is one this mom thinks is okay-lol]Yes,We'll wash the little pig,But not in baby's tub!First we'll wash our baby's cheeksAnd give your knees a scrub.This is the basic format of the wonderful text in this book. A small boy asks his mother if she is going to do something: ""Yes, or no or maybe?"". And momma gives him a warm poetic answer.Will she milk the cow? Fetch the dog? Catch a wren? Well- yes or no or maybe.Four Stars. [B+]. Beautiful full-page paintings adorn this book. They are simply luscious and sweet. The rhyme is nice and the vocabulary is simple enough that a first grader should be able to read it with assistance. [My daughter is almost 6 and we took turns reading the child's questions and the mother's answers.] Great read-aloud. Good addition to home shelves."
3,Deep Forest tryout by Dan Lacksman,"This CD can be called ""Neither here nor there"". Dan Lacksman's only connection with Deep Forest is that he was a producer for the debut album. Please don't mistake him as a composer of Deep Forest. This CD sounds like Deep Forest but not having the creative value what Deep Forest has."
4,It is what it is!,"The product is exactly what is described. It is a 20"" flat screen that is easily installed. The integrated DirecTV card was easily installed and DirecTV had no problem getting it going when I called to activate the card.The picture quality is good, but not great. Why? Because the television is not HD. It should not be a problem for years since DirecTV is digital, but it would be great if they produced a television that was HD and had an integrated receiver. All in all, a good deal for the price!"
4,Great for the kitchen or bedroom,"I've owned this TV / Sat. Receiver for around 6 months now. I was impressed with the ease of setup, and the ability to get rid of the unsightly sat. receiver box. My previous setup on my kitchen counter was a mess of wires, and the remote control situation was cumbersome as well. This TV makes for an elegant solution.Picture quality (while SD) is quite good. News, football, golf, kids shows... all look great. I really don't have any complaints at all.I wish someone would offer a similar option for a large HDTV (with integrated DVR)."
4,A Satisfied Customer,After purchasing this product I was impressed on how quickly it had arrived at my home. The follow up on my satisfaction to the service I had received was also impressive.Thanks
3,"useful list of jobs, no useful specifics","It was useful and inspiring to see a list of writing-related jobs, as a reminder that there's more to a literate career than being a starving artist. However, I didn't find the information under the job listings to be that useful. Information on requirements and contacts was particularly vague and superficial (for job X, look in the classified for listings of job X openings). I think there must be better sources of information on these jobs elsewhere -- look further than this book."
4,Good option,"I have a 1989 YJ. Typical of an older jeep the pump to front engage the front wheels stopped working in 4WD. Having a jeep with out 4WD is pointless. Instead of replacing the faulty pump, I installed this posi lock set up. I have had it for a 1 1/2 year with no problems. I live in Vermont and use my jeep as my daily driver. This winter I have needed 4WD several times to get me to work and in the summer I run my jeep off road. So far this set up has been well worth it.The only down side is you probably should stop to engage this. No 4wd on the go."
4,Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,"We loved Blood & Sand and I am hoping this is going to be just as good without Andy Whitfield. What a loss! I can't really say how the episodes are but if it's anything like the first season, expect lots of violence, sex, and nudity. They don't seem to hold much back on this show. I am looking forward to watching it!"
3,"Sex and violence, violence and sex","I never watched the first season of Spartacus so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. I knew it would violent and saying that is an understatement. I've never seen so much blood, decapitations, bludgeoning, etc. in one program. These scenes are inter-cut with sex scenes that run the gamut from lesbian soft-porn to orgies. Nudity, both sexes, is plentiful. The production values are good. The series has the look of ""300"" with surreal color tones and dramatic sets. The story did not interest me enough to seek out more episodes."
5,Greatest show ever!!!!,This is the greatest show ever.Lots of action and Dustin Clare is my hero.I Pre-ordered this on Amazon and got a Super Deal!!!
4,Subtitles ???,"I saw some chapters and it seems pretty good, but in order to buy it ......... I Just need to know about the subtitles"
1,Poor in front of the past season,"Spartacus ""Gods of the arena"" : First of all I paid in pre order 38$ for this DVDs and now I see that the price has been reduced. After: the first season was aired with many episode more (this one only 6) and this season is much poor as show and action. I rated the first season 5 stars, this one 1 star."
3,Just okay,"This prequel is beautifully filmed (mostly CGI), like the Spartacus-Blood/Sand sereies, lot's of eye candy. The fight scenes are still very ""300"",but the acting and the plot are lame. They add softcore porn, when ever the episode starts to loose steam or try to ""shock"" you. The main actor Andy whitfield was very good and one of the reason to watch, but with him gone (may he rest in peace),it seems John Hannah and ""Zena"" can't carry the series. Too much weekday noon soap opera. Hopefully if there is a third season they will have better scripts and actors."
4,Zero Season,I surprised that they did this season. Turned out well written even though it they lossed there actor do to sickness and had only been able to do season 1. Zero season turned out great. But this series isnt something I'd watch again. So far I've seen 3 seasons. and this one was the best.. this and the first season. I would give it a 5 star but the series is going south. So giving a 5 just doesnt seem right. the show should have ended with this season. Season zero and season 1 is probably were they should have ended it. There supposed to have a season 4.. not sure I'm going to bother.
5,Great purchase!,"I you like action drama mini series, this is for you. A great buy that does not disappoint! You will also want to see Spartacus Blood and Sand, as well as, Spartacus Vengence."
5,Spartacus: Gods of the Arena [HD],This is an excellent program...I have watched countless times and it has to be good or I would never have watched it this much...only problem is that I ordered it in DVD disc's and never got them...I guess I'll have to downlaod them myself...ty Amazom for having it in your movies selection...now how do I get my DVD's ....lol...if you enjoyed the programs I'm sure you would be glad to have them all on DVD....Art Ward
5,Fabulous!!!,"I watched it through netflix after watching season 1. This prequel introduced characters that were just as fascinating as the ones in season 1. I have sinced checked it out of the library and now have decided to purchase it. If you liked season 1, you will like this. The character, Gannicus, was wonderful and worth watching several times. I look forward to season 2 which includes Spartacus and Gannicus."
2,Not My cup of tea (or blood),"I have never seen the original series that ""Gods of the Arena"" is a Prequel to, so perhaps that's one reason why I found this set so lacking in both artistic and entertainment value.Scenes of bloody gladiator battle (complete with spurting jugulars and frequent decapitations) alternate with soft-core porn scenes of gladiators and royalty schtupping to conquer various fair maidens. Occasionally, episodes are padded with scenes of poorly written dialog of 1) males boasting of their strength and sexual prowess, or scheming for riches and power or 2) women gossiping about #1.If you like watching UFC matches, this might appeal, but for me, not so much."
5,"More Blood, Guts, and Sex...",The actual start of the story and how the status quo was obtained. I do have to say the Romans must have gone to school to learn how to party. Never a dull moment. Plots and subplots were very abundant in the story...
4,the story is gripping. I think it could do with a little less graphics.,I really enjoy the setting. I do really think however that graphics are over done. I understand the decay in the soceity needs to come accrossed . I still think that it could have been accomplished with less graphics. The human imagination should have been regarded.
4,Action filled.,"This is a truly a exciting action packed series. If you have watched season 1 of the series, this is a must before seeing season 2."
4,A good program if you're having Spartacus withdrawls.,"When Andy Whitfield got sick and couldn't film the second season of Spartacus, I was devastated. This show filled the gap for me. It has many of the original characters from the first season and some new very nicely chiseled (Gannicus) characters to provided extra eye-candy."
5,Awesome,"Love the Spartacus series! Can't wait for the next one to come out! Even with the actor change in season 2, hubby and I still watch the episodes back to back!"
5,Spartacus,You either love this Starz series or you hate it. I happend to love this prequel. I like the actors and I have watched the first season as well. Too bad that Andy Whitfield died of cancer because he was a great Spartacus. The prequel is about Crixus and Ganicus. I can't wair for season 2 to come out on DVD.
4,Love this series,I love this series. Wish it was a little longer but it hit the spot. The fight and sex scenes are incredible. Trust me you will not be disappointed. RIP Andy Whitfield.
5,background,"There are only 6 episodes to this collection so it is a bit pricey if you ask me but oy is is worth it. The over the top sex and violence you have come to expect is there but there is something more, history..... we learn about the start of the house of Batiatus, the hardships this house had to endure as they tried to become a great house. There is so much backstabbing and manipulating to keep the greatest detective spinning. In the end we know the beginnings that we were unsure of, ooooohhhh that's why they act like that! A GREAT PREQUEL!!!!"
4,gods of the arena,I really enjoy this series and watch it over and over in my spare time. lots of action and great acting.
2,Bootleg!,"The dvd set I received is a counterfeit! None of the disclaimers appear when the disc is played, the Starz and series logo appear on the screen during play and the tv announcer is heard during the credits! The box art doesn't even match the legitimate version! Where are the special features?! There are supposed to be special features but there aren't any! Someone copied these episodes straight from the tv and I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!"
2,Price?,"2 stars for the show. It was worth about 4 overall, but lost 2 for the price. Not as good as Spartacus Blood and sand, but still entertaining. The price; however, is ridiculous... $34.99 for 6 episodes? Over $5 an episode? Are you kidding?"
2,Please lower price back to 24.99....,"The two stars is for the price (I know, know...), but hey - I love this series but don't have 35 bucks to spend on just six episodes. Please lower the price Amazon and then you'll have a sale."
1,Disappointing,This prequel simply does not measure up to the original with the late Andy Whitfield. Enough said. Order at your own odds of feeling ripped off like me.
1,double standard,"I am amazed heterosexual males go for this. The story is poor and not historically acurate and it is a dong fest. Shaved male members flop around while there is no full frontal female nudity to be seen. They cover with merkins. This is objectification of the male, no way around it. But that appears to be the trend in Hollywood. However, even if gay or a hard up female, the show is not very well written or entertaining to keep you involved."
1,"Lots of Violence, Little Plot","I received Spartacus: Gods of the Arena through Amazon Vine for review. As an action film fan, I was curious. I'm so glad I didn't pay for it, as I couldn't finish watching. There aren't many films that I'll stop watching purely because of content, but after almost five solid minutes of stylized violence and gore straight from a horror movie, I had more than enough. Yes, the gladiator sport was a bloody one, but it's not something I want to see glorified. It was violence just for the shock value. Still, I tried fast-forwarding through the bloody scenes to get to the talking/plot. But there doesn't seem to be much. I haven't seen any of the rest of this series, since I don't have the Starz channel. And I was immediately lost. Unfortunately, this show just wasn't for me."
2,hynjk,"I'am still waiting for my too order that wae to be dived on 3/5/2011 son of anacehy,spartacs; god the aeena.."
5,Killer Series,"Easily the most daring show I have ever seen. If I had to sum up Spartacus in one word it would have to be, ""Gripping."" If you don't like blood, violence, and everything that is primal...don't watch. If you do, this could be the best series you ever watch. Great prequel to ""Blood and Sand""...can't wait for the new season to start in January."
5,Best Series Ever,"Absolutely the best series ever produced. A combination of fighting in the arena, training, loyalty, corruption, sex, and scandals. Brilliantly paced, incredibly compelling and fascinating, with extremely graphic slow-motion violence and blood sprays, steamy sex scenes, and sexual innuendos pertaining to the male anatomy. The villains are delightfully evil, the women exude lust, and the gladiators are vicious killing machines and are perfect EYE CANDY.The entire cast is superb.Excellent!!"
3,Good,"I liked this sort of in-between season. In my opinion it isn't quite as good as season one. The writing seemed a bit off and (someone please tell me if it's my imagination) the dialogue seemed stranger than in the first season. I know they've always spoken in what is supposed to be ""Latin"", but this season seemed more immersed in that style than even the previous one. It just seemed a bit awkward at times, a bit forced."
5,Best show,"Just orderd ,estimated delivery 4 oct.This is just the best show, period.I watched all seasons and cant wait tosee the extended, the extra's and especiallythe HD Blu-ray quality.Must have"
1,Zoning Issue,"Could not watch it due to incorrect zoning. Didn't think to look for zoning when ordering. I think Amazon should consider making the zoning more obvious for purchasers in different zoning areas. I purchased the collection again at a local retailer and i must say we are thoroughly enjoying it - a bit gori, blood, guts etc. and a lot of sex scenes. A interesting story line!!!!"
4,Great collection of DVD's for all those Spartacus fans,I remember this series when it originally aired. This collection of DVD's is well produced and was a great bargin for the price.
5,Well done!!,I was completely impressed with it but it was still short! I hope the Spartacus Vengeance dose a good justice!!
4,An Explicit Look At Ancient Rome,"When it comes to gladiators my only recent film experience to compare this to isGladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray] . In comparison, this series is much more bloody and explicit in its depictions of Roman decadence. I have no knowledge of how real the depictions of Roman life are but if it were like this, I could see how that civilization fell. Slavery, treachery and orgies are depicted. The story is engaging, but obviously not for everyone with the amount of gore and sex depicted. There are several featurettes, one where the wardrobe designer states she used ancient murals to get the show's designs. I don't know if all in the show is that researched, but some things, like the public bathroom depiction, are interesting indeed. So, I recommend it, especially if you had any interest in Gladiator or ancient Roman society."
1,Bad Packaging,"The video is ok, production values excellent. Still it comes to nothing when the glue that is at the bottom of the package sleeve leaked onto one edge of disk #1 ruining it. I ended up throwing the set out, since disk #2 is very short and mostly taken up with extras. If you order this title, be sure to remove it asap from its original packaging."
3,Subtitles,"Somebody nows if there are any subtitles in this product? I'd like to buy it, but only with subtitles either in English, French, Catalan or Spanish. Thank youSpartacus: Gods of the Arena"
1,Bootleg,This dvd set was Bad quality.it was Advertised as new. Was opened and looks to be bootleged! I am very disapointed!
3,SOLID,"When this album first came out, I remember I was hesitant to buy it. This album really nice with smooth, laid back grooves and Billy's voice is so soft. Trackmasters did a really good job producing this album. Overall, nice album."
2,very average,She is a Okay vocalist.the material is pretty run of the mill.nothing special kinda catchy.
3,This is a good biography but...,"While this is a rather good biography and offers more details about the life of perhaps the most well known preacher of the 19th century than even I knew about, the book suffers where the author has unfortunately adopted a cut-and-paste method in his work. What he has done is lift many sections from the works of others and placed them in his book with such frequency that nearly every page has an insertion of this type. And to find and read this on nearly every page is disconcerting to say the least. It's almost as if one is reading someone else's book or books. If you can ignore this discrepancy then this is a book well worth the read. If, however, you find this as troubling as I did then you may want to look elsewhere."
5,paradise lost jamming with amorphis and in ruins,"ever eve sounds like paradise lost in a session with amorphis, in ruins, and crematory. their sound has a beauty to it, while at the same time it kicks you in the rear end."
5,Best cage bedding out there!,"Cedar is supposed to be toxic. Pine is too dusty. The paper stuff doesn't help with the odor. So far THIS fits the safe, low dust, best smelling needs better than any bedding I've ever used! Will never switch to anything else!"
2,Small,Smaller than I expected. The units didn't match our existing bag of litter so it was hard to compare ahead of time.
3,"If you're gonna complain, explain why please.","This book has great pictures, useful information and a little section about the author's own experience hiking a certain place. All good and useful, but what drives me crazy about this book is that they often toss in at the end ""don't bother camping here"" or ""what to do? Camping? Forget it."" But then they NEVER tell you why you shouldn't camp there. I mean, seriously. Consider that everyone has a different thing they are looking for and explain why you think one shouldn't camp there.Is it there's no space?Is it against park rules?Simply too many people?Does it get too cold?I'm finding myself using this book to find a first backpacking location with an 8 year old, and every place that seems doable, they say not to bother camping there. Well, thanks for a whole lot of negativity and very little explaination. I'm planning on *not* taking their advice when it comes to Lake Ann and just hitting it!!!"
3,All bark and no bite,"Like the last guide I purchased ""Best Loop Hikes Washington"", this book completely ignores the eastern half of the state, which can be frustrating if you live in Eastern Washington. This particular book the authors have decided to take a different route with their trail descriptions. Instead of actually describing them, they spend most of the time trying to make witty comments about this or that, which I found annoying.The pictures however are cool, thats why I'm giving it 3 stars."
2,More from the masters of diatribe,Authors Spring and Manning would have done much better serving their readers with more about hikes in Washington and less with their ad nauseum opinions on the Forest Service.
2,A good guide by some old negative fussy butts.,"The trail descriptions and the amount of information in all of Ira Spring and Harvey Manning's books are great. They provide some great info, but....they are two of the most negative guide book writers that I have ever read. They hate dogs, motorcycles, bikes, and horses, as well as the Forest Service and NPS. Fine, hate them, say it once, get it over with and then shut-up about it. But no, they go on and on and on about motorcycles, mountain bikes, and everything that does not meet their definition of appropriate recreation. I took a black marker to all of the negative comments in their North Cascades book, and black ended up on almost every page. Again, it has good information and can be really helpful if you can stomach the negativity."
2,"If you've read their other guides, you've read this one.","While this edition supplies something that the other books in Spring and Mannings series don't, namely color pictures, there is really very little new here. The authors have updated the text in a few instances and their introduction/preface is new, but there are pictures and descriptions in this book that date to the First Edition.And I must ask ""Why?"" Why was it necessary to publish this book? Spring and Manning endlessly lament the fact that most of these hikes are overcrowded, overused, overloved, trampled beyond all recognition, and yet they publish a ""new"" guidebook so that these very places may be abused to a greater extent. I don't get it.If you don't own the other books in this series and don't plan to buy them, by all means buy this one. Just don't be suprised if 2.5 million others are at the trailhead with you."
2,Makes you want to hang up your boots,"If the underlying reason for publishing this book was to secretly deter people from hiking... well it works. Unfortunately, these experienced hikers share mostly negative outlooks on many of the hikes. The tone is very egotistical, as they slam the Forest Service and other hikers. It would be exhausting to hike with these guys, as they mostly point out the negative aspects and wrongdoings of everybody who isn't in their circle. The book does not spark any excitement to hike these trails...which may be point.And the writing...also exhausting. My brain hurt trying to decipher the wordy ""imagery.""Very preachy, their way is the only way. This book is lame."
5,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite books about Big Mike and his sidekick, Penelope. The baseball players are quirky and while Penelope doesn't find a lot of clues to work with, she and Big Mike have a lot of fun looking for them. Only thing is, When will we get these books on Kindle? Please, Garrison Allen, work something out for all of us whose paperbacks are falling apart."
3,Not bad for the price,"This CD is not a Mix set -- all individual, full tracks. This CD is a compilation of softer type of Trance tracks, so don't expect anything hard, high-energy, or rave material. Some tracks (most of them) start off slow, and in some, you won't find that energizing beat until the halfway mark. Overall, this album is okay. I got it at an amazing deal, and for 3 CDs, you can't beat that."
5,Its a great book!!!!!,"I think that the auther really realises that being a teenager isn't that easy , and it shows in her books."
2,Celestron 114EQ,"Bought the Celestron 114 EQ ten days ago for my girlfriend. It's very easy to set up, even comes with a screw driver. Unfortunately the erector scope was loose and fell apart. The biggest problem is that I haven't been able to see anything with it. All I see is a bright white light, even in daylight. I'm waiting to hear from Celestron to see if it will have to go back to the shop and be replaced, which will cost a fortune. I'll be wary in future about buying a scope online in case things go wrong again.I know lots of people are happy with the product. But the manual or Celestron website needs to cover the reasons for this problem. I've been googling for solutions for days."
3,Good overall but could stand some improvement,"The telescope has pretty good optics which provide a nice clean, crisp, clear picture. Unfortunately, the controls and movements for it could use some improvement. Too many plastic parts and metal parts with too loose a tolerances which makes adjusting, moving, or repositioning the scope a pain."
2,Don't expect traditional Antec quality!!,"Antec has a reputation for producing high-quality case. I bought the ""Performance Plus 660"" a few months ago and was amazed by the finish and ease of use of the case, and the quality of the ""True Power 330"" power supply that came with it.I was, however, deceived with the present iteration. Antec reused the hugely successful case and outfitted it with a less than stellar SL300 power supply. While that combination sounds good on paper, I noticed at once some manufacturing defects on the case, most notable as a bad fit of each side panel with the frame. Moreover, the SL300 power supply casing feels cheap and ply esily to pressure, a sure sign that less-than-stellar material and workmanship were used.I am left to wonder whether I stumble across a bad lot, or whether Antec decided to boost his bottom line by cutting corners. Even if the price is right, users expecting Antec quality will be left high and dry."
3,Finish does not last,"I received these pots four years ago as a wedding gift. I was so disappointed when I found out how much they cost because they are not worth it at all. Within weeks of using them I started to notice black flecks in my food. The finish was already coming off. I read the booklet before using and did everything they said, but it didn't help. You can't use these pans to make eggs or pancakes either. The batter will sink into the groves and burn.On the plus side, I will admit that nothing will stick to these pans, even after the finish is shot. Trust me too, I have made some horrible messes in them."
5,Worth the price without a doubt,"I have been using my current Circulon pots and pans for the last 11 years (possibly 13yrs - I cant remember). I just bought a new set cuz after 11+ years they just needed to be replaced. They have put in their time and performed admirably. I did have a problem with food sticking to one of the frying pans about a month or so after I got them so I called the compnay and they sent me a brand new one free of charge as per their warranty. I wash them by hand and also in the dishwasher (on the top shelf). I have found them to be strong and durable. They provided me with over a decade of even cooking, browning and non-stick service. Considering almost everything these days is disposable, or out of date a year after you purchase it, to find something that lasted 11+ years is a nice change."
2,It does not last,"I received this set as wedding gift 6 years ago. I cook every day, lunch and dinner, after 3 years using it. The surface inside started to come off in pieces. It is not last as long it should be for the price they asked for. I think the best pan I have used that last a long time is the cast iron pan which my hubby has it for over 20 years, it's still cook like when he first has it. It's heavy, but it works everytime, you don't have to worry about eating those little pieces that come out from the pan."
1,"Byer be ""warped""","I have bought several separate pieces of circulon, and quite surprised to see not one but several pieces WARP. I went to put a lid on the pot and realized it was no longer round! I never use over med. high heat and don't STEW things for hours. Contacted manufacturer and they never responded. It is suppose to have a lifetime guarantee. They finally got back with me and insisted I mistreated it?Buyer be ware !"
2,Good pan but not perfect !!,"Please make sure to follow all the instruction on how to clean and use this type of pan because, if you won't; you would mess up the non-stick part of the pan. . Do not put it in the dishwasher and make sure to use wooden or plastic to stir whatever you are cooking in it, because you gonna scratch the surface of the pan if you won't ."
3,Circulon not good in the long-haul,"I have had my circulon set for about 5 yrs. I am looking to replace it and would not buy it again. The ""circles"" may say they help in heating, however, in truth, they require more cleaning and sometimes with a brush to get things out of the ""circles"". As a result of this extra scrubbing, I do not believe the interior finish holds up. I also don't like that the anodized pans can't go in the dishwasher but that is true of all anodized."
2,Hi-Low grooves very hard to clean!,"We purchased this set of cookware a little over a year ago. We have followed the care instructions completely (using low-medium heat, hand washing, and using no non-stick spray). Over time, particles have built up in the ""hi-low"" grooves and they are no longer non-stick. I have tried everything I can think of to get them clean (including what the Circulon website suggests) but it has not worked. I am so disappointed!If you look around the web, you'll find that I am not the only one with this problem. Please do your research! Before spending the money, consider a hard-anonized product that is smooth and therefore easier to maintain."
5,Perfect,I bought my circulon set when we moved in our new house about 3 years ago and i love it. It is perfect for me and my family.I use it almost everyday but still look like new.All my friends and family like it too.
4,pot and pans,pans were as ordered very heavy and well construted the price was great as was the service
3,Interior finish flakes,I've had a full set for about 4 years. They worked absolutely beautifully the first year or two-although the larger sauce pan somehow bent when I dropped it shortly after purchase making a tight lid fit difficult.The main problem is that the interior non-stick finish flakes and seems to wear out quickly than I would like. I have never used metal utensils or a dishwasher on these pots. May have been caused my using high heat when I first started using them though-absolutely nothing stuck. Still using the pots but have moved on to caphalon non-stick for skillets.
3,"Great when new, but not so great after a few years","We were initially very happy with the Circulon when we first bought it. Nonstick pan worked great (with the exception of grooves appearing on your omelets). After maybe 4-5 years, cooking eggs became a chore as they would begin to stick to the pan. Now, the fry pan has totally lost it's nonstick properties. The finish is still fine but it just doesn't release food properly from the pan. We had to buy some new nonstick pans. The Circulon pots still work fine though, but they're mostly used for liquids (soups, stews, etc.). I probably would not buy this again."
1,disappointed,"I bought this set a while ago and opened it just lately. I was very disappointed to find two 8-inches skillets but the 10-inch missing!!! and another thing: none of the lids fit the 4-quart saucepan right (it remains slightly open).I tried contacting the company to share the mismatch between description and the product I got but I always got to a dead end. I will not recommend this item to my friends. Too bad, because other than these complains, I like the product..."
5,2 Years Later they still look like new,I bought these 2 years ago - and I use them all the time.Great set for a fair price. You cannot beat the clean up and the even heat. One of the pots was damaged and I called Circulon and they exchanged without a hassle.
5,bsandi in CA,I purchased this set over a year ago. We cook a lot more than the average household. Nothing sticks to them. The stay cool handles are great. The finish still looks brand new. This is the best set of cookware that I have used. I was reading the other reviews listed on this page and I cannot beleive that erindipity in MS and I have the same pans.
4,Fayola,"I purchased my first 14 piece cookware set about 4 1/2 years ago.I considered this to be an expensive purchase they cost me about $350.00.I was impressed by the appearance, the weight(very heavy), metal handles(for oven use), and nonstick surface.It was the perfect set.I followed the instructions and took good care of them.I didn't use them too much as I wanted them to last forever and keep their nice appearance.Little by little I noticed the grooves turning brown, at first I thought it was food that was stuck.I was wrong it was rust they were rusting some looked so bad that I stopped using them in fear of it contaminating the food.I returned them to Meyer and they immediately sent me a new set.They are beautiful and without the grooves.Meyer has done good on their promise and for this reason I would not hesitate to buy from them again.I'm hoping they will not rust again but if they do I know that I they have a lifetime warantee..."
4,good,"Good product, however the handle arrived busted and i cannot get it replaced without returning the whole set. Seems like a wast for just one pan."
2,I have to agree with E Suter...,"...these pans are far from all they are cracked up to be.I had mine given to me as a housewarming gift by my parents, five years ago. Just like E Suter says, the coating comes off no matter how well you follow the care advice. Worse still, once the coat does come off they are harder to use and the inerior of them looks more of a mess everytime you use them. The lifetime gaurantee is rubbish, unless we are taking the lifetime of an very old newt!"
5,the best cookware,i have 4 grown children and they all use this..and love it..my youngest daughter said she never thought it mattered what you used to cook in until we gave her this for her birthday..and now she says she wouldnt trade them for anything..
4,cooks nicely but product was damaged,"These pots cook nicely and so far food does not stick; however, when I received the package one of the pots was dented and the lid did not fit. I called and was told I had to send back the entire shipment and la de da which was just too much hassle."
5,I LOVE MY POTS,Circulon Classic 14-Piece Cookware SetI love these pots. I feel like I can cook anything and at the discounted price you cannot beat the value. If you have good cookware it makes you want to try cooking new things. Buy them you'll be glad you did
2,They were great - for about 4 years!,"I've had my circulon set for about 4 1/2 years now and I loved them, couldn't live without them, until a few months ago. They're becoming increasingly difficult to clean and are forming a sticky residue despite the fact that I've cared for them exactly as the maufacturer said. When looking for the Meyers web site to email them, I came across some complaints of the exact same nature by people who sent their cookware back to Meyers in hopes that they would make good on the lifetime warrenty and Meyers sent a form letter (!!) saying they obviously misused them and that the warrenty is void. Unless you're willing to shell out a few hundred dollars for pots every few years (I'm not!) look elsewhere."
1,Circulon gave me the cold shoulder!,"I received this wonderful set of pots and pans. They looked beautiful!!! When I went to put the lid on the large sauce pan, it would not fit. The pan is warped. I called the number that the warrenty gave and told them of the defective item. Their response was that because I bought the items through AMAZON that they would do nothing to help me. They make the product not AMAZON. So, as a result of them not standing by their product and their warranty I will not order another product that holds this name again. There are to many competitors that make fine cookware to spend my money on this company."
4,Very pleased,"I bought a set of these pots and pans about 2 years ago. The groves can be a nuisance because sometimes food gets stuck in the them but for the price of anodized aluminum this is a bargain! The heat is distributed evenly and the food turns out great. They are basically very easy to clean too, just scrub a little deeper in the groves for stuck-in messes."
2,The outer finish comes off and gets everywhere!,"I have had these pans for 7 months. I know that several of the pieces have been put through the dishwasher, but for the most part I have hand-washed them. The outer finish comes off everywhere, and turns my sink, sponge, and clothes black when I get splashed. Now my pans look terrible (not just ""seasoned"") and I have now replaced them with a $60 set from LNT. In my opinion, these pans are NOT worth the money. And if you think you could run them through the dishwasher, like I did only a couple of times, you'll regret it."
2,Some lids didn't fit,"The set looked nice. As I was unpacking it, though, I thought I was missing a lid. I finally realized the lid given for the large pan just wasn't even close to fitting. Unfortunately, that meant I had to repackage the whole thing and return it. If you order this product, unpack carefully, you may need to return it."
5,Circulon,I have always liked Circulon and getting the 14 piece set was a great deal for the price. It's a very sturdy set and will last a long time I have no doubt.Circulon Classic 14-Piece Cookware Set
2,NOT WORTH THE $$!!,"They lasted about 2 years before everything started sticking to them and are horribly difficult to clean. I had begged my husband for these thinking these were going to be my longterm pots for the kitchen...now i have to start begging for a new set....not from cirulon again thats for sure. I have pots much cheaper than what i paid for these and they work so much better. Also i had some of the same problem as did other people..when i first got them the lids dont fit easily, but i ignored that thinking as long as it cooks well i dont care. What a waste of money!!"
3,circulon,"This is a very big set. it is to soon to review about the non stick quality. But its a big set for the price. I paid 150 $. You can use half set now and half later.Only one tihng the pots in the set are not as heavy, as its circulon 2 or other circulon. I think its lower end of circulon model."
1,Circulon Classic pans,"This set was given to my son as a birthday gift. One pan was so mishapen that the lid didn't fit and one pan had a gouge in the cooking surface. He sent it back, an inconvenience, and received back another set which had one mishapen pot, which he forced into shape and another with a less severe gouge. He decided to keep the set. I own this cookware, which I bought locally several years ago, and it has been an exceptional set of cookware. I am very disappointed in Amazon for sending out cookware with major flaws. I will think twice before I order from Amazon again."
4,Great so far,"I have read some of the other reviews and I have to say I'm baffled by them. Granted, I have only had it a few weeks but I love it. It's great cookware, that is functional and nice looking. It does need to be hand washed but that it no problem as we don't have a dishwasher and they are so easy to clean. Nothing seems to stick to them. This set comes with all of the pots and pans any average home will need. I love it!"
5,Glad to add the loudmouth receiver.,Ordered T.O. To try to finish out my McFarlane Eagle collection. He came to me fast and in great condition. Happy to have him.
3,Time Does Fly But Not On This CD,"Don't get me wrong! Huey Lewis & The News are one of the greatest bands of the 80's but this so called ""Best Of"" is nothing of the sort. I've one question? Where are all the hits? You can't have a Huey Lewis & The News ""Best Of"" without ""Jacobs Ladder"" or ""Perfect World"" or ""Back In Time"" or ""Couple Days Off"". Fore! (pun intended) examples why this album is not worthy of it's ""best of"" title. And I'm pretty sure they probably left off your favorite song too!"
4,"Great package, but something is missing.....","A pretty good 16-hit package from Huey Lewis and the News Guys, but noticably missing are their monster hits ""Perfect World"", ""Hip To Be Square"", and ""Jacob's Ladder"". Throw these three tunes in, and I would have given this album a solid 5-star rating. Still some terrific, straight forward rock and roll from one of the best groups of the 1980's."
3,Fun '80's music,"Back in the 1980's I loved Huey Lewis's music. Today it sounds dated!! Huey's music was and still is fun! This greatest hits CD covers most of the bases. You won't play it every day, but every so often its nice to put on this CD and visit a few old friends from the past."
3,A So-So Representation Of Huey Lewis,"One of the more surprising harmonica players out there is Huey Lewis. Early on in his career, Lewis spent some time in Europe playing harmonica for tips, honing his craft. The result was one heck of a good harmonica player and band leader.So what happened when a major got a hold of him? They churned out album after album of musical pap that sold a boatload of records. If this particular album is truly a ""Best Of"" compilation, then it would show that Huey Lewis and the News was merely a light-weight, gutless group of glorified lounge musicians. The actual truth is that the group was in fact quite good.If what you're looking for is a sampoling of their hits, then go ahead and buy this CD. If you really want to hear this band at their true best, get the real albums and listen to the non-hit cuts."
2,"Huey's Music Great, but....","This is a good compilation but it feels very incomplete. They should have left off the new songs and placed some other more deserving songs on this CD. Disappointing, to say the least. Huey Lewis deserves a stronger anthology."
1,Wrong Album Shown,"The album and songs shown on this page are for a different album. The reviews are for ""Time Flies - The Best Of Huey Lewis"" but the album is ""The News"" by an entirely different group. I wanted the MP3 download for 'Time Flies..."" and almost downloaded this one by mistake. What gives? The CD page for the Huey Lewis album refers me here for the MP3 download of the same album. Something is mixed up on the site."
5,News' Best,"Time Flies is an appropriate name to this collection of hits from Huey Lewis & The News. It's hard to believe that it has almost been twenty years since the band scored their first hit with the amazing ""Do You Believe in Love"". The rest of the album conjures up fond memories of youth with 80's classics like ""Heart & Soul', ""I Want A New Drug"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""If This Is It"", ""Perfect World"" and ""The Heart Of Rock 'N' Roll"". The album has four new songs with ""Til The Day After"" and ""100 Years From Now"" particularly standing out. Huey Lewis & The News make strong, fun and completely enjoyable music and this collection is a shining example of their greatness."
3,Names Of Band Members,"For those of you who don't know the names of the band members, they are:Huey Lewis-Vocals, harmonica (You probably knew that already)Johnny Colla-Rhythm guitar, saxophoneBill Gibson-DrumsChris Hayes-Lead guitarSean Hopper-KeyboardsMario Cipollina, John Pierce-BassHorn section:Marvin McFadden-TrumpetRon Stallings, Rob Sudduth-Saxophones"
3,Greatest hits?,"While all the songs on this album are good, I have just one question: What kind of Huey Lewis Greatest Hits CD doesn't include ""Hip To Be Square""?"
4,"It's a great CD, but it could have been so much better!","This might be a great pick up for those who remeber the sounds of HL&N in 1985, but it is not a really good indicator of the greatest hits from the band's entire career. It tends to be very pre-1986 oriented, which is not such a bad thing - their most recognized hits are ""Heart of Rock & Roll,"" ""Power of Love"" & ""I Want a New Drug."" However, they did have some more recent hits that were left off, such as ""Hip To Be Square,"" ""Perfect World"" and ""Couple Days Off."" HL&N's last three albums were completely ignored! Don't get me wrong - it's a great CD. The 4 new songs are teriffic, especially ""100 Years from Now."" As a huge HL&N fan, the selections of hits are a bit of a let down. I'm glad I got the CD, every song is hot, and I still think you should put this CD in your shopping cart."
4,It will do for now,"Huey Lewis & The News / Time Flies...the best of...: Not a complete collection of their hits but one that will entertain until they get around to making a better collection. Even then, I might just stick with this one. Four Stars."
4,The News Never Dies,"Huey Lewis & The News was one of the most surprising acts of the 1980's. Time flies resembles the bands most successful songs. From If This Is It, to Bad is Bad, this collection struts out a lot.Although the band is not as popular as they were back then, the music still remains strong. I always come back to it for a good time."
3,Not your ordinary Michener,"I am dissapointed. I've read a lot of Michnener and I was expecting something more along the Alaska, Cheasapeke, The Source format. This nook was not like that."
4,Well worth the time,"Gritty, tough and rough. It may take a while to get in the saddle, but once you're there, you don't give up until you have taken the entire ride with these unforgettable characters. Not everyone will appreciate the reality expressed --- the corruption of the young country is revealed in a stark portrayal. But, it's a fine read, and the images don't fade fast from your memory. It reminds us of the struggle to be born...and to morph into something finer. We are left waiting for the next chapter."
1,I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK!,"I was disappointed in this book. I felt that it was cut and pasted from every post game newspaper interview that I read last season. I thought that it was put together very quickly and without much thought. Maybe I expected more? Morrissey basically reguritates quotes that were written in the NY newspapers last season. There was little in this book that captivated me to want to read more. He has a chapter about Melky Cabrera and writes about Matsui almost the entire chapter, even though Matsui has his own chapter earlier in the book. I was hoping that he would take us into the inner workings of the New York Yankees and he really does not. If you are a die-hard Yankee fan, you will get nothing from this book that you don't already know. It feels like you are reading old newspaper quotes from the 2006 season. He offers little to no perspective of the 2006 season to the reader. Its just quote after quote after quote..."
1,awful,This was like reading a year's worth of newspapers at once. There is absolutely nothing worthwhile that even the most casual Yankee fan doesn't know. (Jeter and A-Rod don't get along? you're kidding!) This was clearly slapped together and put out to coincide with the start of the baseball season. I read a lot of baseball books and this is waaaayyyyy at the bottom.
5,Great gift for a Yankee Fan serving oversees,"My nephew is in the Air Force deployed in the United Arab Emerites so he's away from his wife and three little kids for a while. I sent this to him for Easter - and had it shipped direct from Amazon to his APO box so there was no delay. I figured this would be a much more welcome gift than a chocolate Easter bunny and would fare better in the warm UAE temperatures as well. My nephew had it in no time - here's what he had to say about it: ""Got the book already 3 chapters into it. Love it! I'm stationed here with a Boston fan. I'll make sure he reads it"" :-)"
2,Back Seat Cover,"This was a great product, love the fabric, no complaints about the product itself, BUT>>>>>>> It does not fit the back seat of a Ford Freestyle.Too short for the seat, it fits great on one side, but rides up on the other."
1,Don't use this merchant!,"The games that I purchased did not work, the games were POORLY wrapped with a brown gricery bag and scotch tape, the games and their boxes were smashed, and the address label was a post-it with a bunch of scotch tape over it. My 9 year old could have done a better job."
5,Great Customer Service!!,"I purchased this item, but it was a different color than in the photo above (Just so you know it is a darker wood) and there was minor damage to one of the leg attachments. I e-mailed customer service and received a response that day. Further, they also called me and apologized for the damage to the leg and the color confusion. The representative did everything to make the return easy for me and processed my refund right away. I would have just asked for another table but the actual darker wood color would not match with my current set, and they were respectful of that. I highly recommend purchasing from The Gift Patch. I know I will visit their website when I need things for the home. I wouldn't be concerned about the damage, afterall, it does happen, and they seemed so sincerely surprised about it, I gather that it doesn't happen to them often. Five stars."
2,bag mesh rips,Bag mesh ripped shortly after purchase. Only kept 10 size 5s in the bag at a time and it quickly fell apart. Love kwik goal products but this one didn't perform to standards.
2,Weak Mesh,"I have been using this bag for about a year now, and at first it obtained larger holes in the mesh part of the bag from the mesh giving way. I am now either going to have to find another bag or find someone to sew up the whole top part of the bag as it has seperated from the mesh part leaving a large opening for balls to fall out of. It seems as if the mesh part of the bag or poor craftsmanship in the sewing process is the issue. I am now doing research to find a better bag and I am sure there is one. I would not recommend getting this bag unless you only plan on carrying a few balls in it."
1,DSPer,Please be aware that there is nothing in this book that is not available from TI. The authors took material from the TI manuals VERBATIM.I do not know ehy they wrote this book.
5,Catch this one,"What a great book! Colorful, beautiful pictures. Wonderful story. You can't help but enjoy it."
2,"Eh, sleeping hasn't changed","I was disappointed that only a few pages of the entrie book really discusses what specifically to do at night to put your child to sleep and what to do when they wake up during the night. I wish there was more about just this! The other chapters don't provding anything hands on regarding sleep. Our daughter still does not sleep, and the methods suggested only made her cry even harder. I think she is just destined to be a terrible sleeper - even though the book claims all kids will eventually sleep. She is 7 months old and waking up 3-5 times a night. :("
4,It's a miracle!!,"I didn't think I could let my baby cry. But I was at the end of my rope and my neck was killing me from rocking her all day. First 3 minutes she screamed so hard I almost bit my arm off. Next 5 minutes she calmed down. Next 10 minutes, she fell asleep... I thought it was a miracle. The trick is to follow the steps dilligently, DO NOT pick her up. She was sleeping by herself the second day. If my baby can do it, ANY BABY can do it!!Giving 4 stars because I don't think his book is easy to read. it reads like a medical journal."
1,"Would love to read this, but",The Kindle version is $3 more than the print version on Amazon. What sense does that make for a company who claims to be trying to reduce their ecological impact?
2,Didn't work for us,"If you're a new mom, don't get this book...I have a masters degree and am a financial manager but on maternity leave when I had another person suggest this book to us to help with sleep training (after babywise didn't work)...this book was like reading a study. Maybe it's better in paper format where you can skip pages easier but on the kindle, I was SO tired and SO lost--it was like reading greek."
1,I returned this one,I suggest this book....to those who want to be cruel parents. I immediatly returned this book after understanding Dr. Ferber's method.
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"I tried to Ferberize my son and it is one of the things I really regret. He is a very social person and just wanted company at night. Listening to him cry in despair was torture. Then he somehow climbed out of his crib (something he had not been able to do before) and fell on his head. I heard the thump from outside the door and thought I had killed him. Why is our culture so obsessed with leaving children alone at night, crying and throwing up with fear, until they learn that no one is going to come and help them? How could that possibly make a child feel more secure in the world? Don't get into a battle of wills with your child about sleep. Whatever happens, you'll both lose."
1,Trust your instincts. This method is not for everyone.,"If you are trying this method and it feels wrong, than it is. i am a mother of 5. My 3 month old sleeps for 7 hrs now and there has never been one minute of crying. PLEASE read The No Cry Sleep Solution instead, or try the Happiest Baby on the Block techniques.Listen to your instincts please. IF it breaks your heart to make your baby CYO - don't you think it breaks their hear too?"
1,zero stars,Didn't address any of the sleep issues I have w/ my child. Pretty much all generic information that could be found Online for free. Gave one star because zero is not an option
1,"Too much, too late.","If your expectation is to receive this book, look up your child's specific sleep issue in the index, and read a solution, you'll be disappointed. If I were trying to become an expert on all baby/child sleep problems, I would love this book. But to try and quickly find practical solutions for my baby's needs, I still haven't found the answer in the book (and I've had it 6 weeks). It's too much information, too late."
1,ferber,"The incorrect book was sent to me. I purchased the new version of Ferber Solves Your Child's Sleep Problems but the old version was sent to me. Although the book itself was incorrect, it was in good condition and came in a timely fashion."
2,"I don't know if its just me and my baby, or if this method doesn't work","It is difficult to implement this. And, when babies teethe or are sick (which, unfortunately happens a lot between 6-12 months), it is challenging to implement. I'm breastfeeding and husband and I are both working outside of the home, so I read the book, tried implementation, and I'm getting more sleep, but baby is far from sleeping through...maybe it's just us..."
3,Interesting,"I liked the insights that Dr. Ferber gives regarding sleep habits. I found them to be very true with my son. However, most of this book was non-applicable to my situation and so I pretty much just tried his sleep approach. Going in every few minutes on his schedule did not work for my son. He would start getting calmed down and then we would go in and he would start up again. The 2nd night we stopped going in and it worked so much better. I guess you just have to try many approaches to see which will work best with your individual child. There seems to be no ""one size fits all"" approach."
3,Mostly common sense,"Most of the ideas and suggestions given in the book were common sense. I had a problem with my children coming into our room at night and waking us up for various reasons - scared, had to go to the bathroom, etc. There was one suggestion given that has helped us - we put up a baby gate in the hallway to their room so that they can get out of their room and use the bathroom themselves but it blocks them from getting as far as our room. They haven't learned how to climb over the gate yet!"
3,Offers Insight and Possible Solution For Baby Sleep,"A guide for parents who would like to evaluate their child's current sleep patterns and help them to develop new ones using a modified cry-it out technique. This book is interesting because while it does offer parents a modified ""cry-it-out"" solution to their baby's sleep problems, it also addresses so many of the other issues baby have when we put them down to sleep. The chapters that include information on sleepwalkng, night terrors, sudden partial wakings, nightmares, bedwetting, headbanging, and sleep apnea are so terrific because they are often not addressed in your everyday ""help baby to sleep through the night book."""
5,It works,This book was very helpful getting our baby to sleep through the night. He was TORTURING us trying to get him to bed and waking up 10 times a night. We instituted the Ferber technique around 5 1/2 months. It took about a week to really start working. And he is still sleeping through the night at 1 1/2 years. Highly recommended!
2,Good info but that's it.,My husband a I both felt that this book had great information and explained very well sleeping patterns and reasons for a child to have sleep problems but we could not just let our child lay there a cry for long periods of time. It was breaking his heart and ours.
2,Maybe I'll Try Again Later,"We tried this method for a few nights and a few naps when our daughter turned three months old, but it just didn't work for us. Perhaps we didn't give it enough time, but we just couldn't take it. The first night we started at 8:45, and she cried until 3:30 in the morning--she threw up twice during the process and snubbed for hours after we gave up. The next night after four hours, I gave up again, knowing that she was stubborn and would go until 3:30 again if we'd allow it. At four months old we started the No Cry Sleep Solution with better results. After only a week she began sleeping for six hours before waking for a short nursing period, and she is napping in bed for up to two hours each time. She is being put down while asleep now, so maybe we'll try the Ferber method when we start putting her down awake. My friends rave about Ferber, I just didn't have the stomach to make her cry for hours on end."
4,Has some value,"This method has value, makes sense and does work -- mostly. But it is not the end-all be-all. I recommend this book; it can help. Nothing is ""THE"" solution, though"
4,RAC '- Diversions,"Deep electro from RAC on their debut, DIVERSIONS. The Duckenworth/Benson duo know how to construct a good stomp, as on ""High Wire"" or ""Mindfield."" They aren't afraid either to expand their sonic range, with the more tropical tones of ""Hula Loops"" or the momentary voices on ""Raindancer"" or the tubular synths of ""Wavelength."" And although whale sounds may be terribly played out, they add an almost acid-like touch to ""Electro Fish."" Elsewhere, ""Neo Rio"" adds a perky touch, and ""Detour"" ends the album with some breaks. Still holds up great after all these years."
4,Worth your Money!,This Harold and Kumar flick is not as good as the first but way better than the second film. I bought it in 3D and I must say it looks really good. Lots of pop out at you moments and story line is one of the better comedies of 2011. Worth your money if you have a 3D tv.
4,Christmas Farce-Worthy,"Harold and Kumar arent close friends anymore but a special guest makes sure that doesnt last long in this rauckous Christmas Farce. The drug references are way too numerous to mention and theres a few big laughs at the crazy antics these two get themselves into. There's a whole storyline of a toddler getting inadvertently high on several drugs, which I thought was humorless, not a prude, just dont think a child getting drugs is funny. This movie would have gotten 3 stars from me as overall enjoyable but a little heavy on the friendship monologues. The 4th Star however goes to Neil Patrick Harris! He was only in the movie for 10 minutes but I laughed the hardest when he was on screen. His on-screen persona of a guy who's a slimeball pretending to be gay is still hilarious. And N.P.H. pulls off that and a hysterical musical number all in one. Thank you Neil, you once again saved Harold and Kumar from mediocrity!"
4,not for teenagers,"I bought this for my 15 year old son along with 2 other of their moviesMy son saw White Castle movie on Tv. we watched and thought it was so funnySo I decided to buy movies as xmas gifts giving him christmas one on ThanksgivingWHAT A MISTAKE.! TO MUCH SEX and sex references. I told him he cant have it back till he is 18Wow I was so embaressed.The movies are funny but for adults, don't be fooled by the tv versionsChristmas movie boarders on porn."
2,The franchise falls off,"I loved the first two movies, but this one didn't do it for me. I didn't see it in theaters or in 3D so maybe that didn't help, but the movie was just way more cheesy, stupid, and forced than I was expecting. This one seemed to be made for the sake of money with no real ambition to create another great film for this comedic series."
3,i love the h&k movies especially NPH scenes,"but this xmas movie did not compare to the 1st 2 movies. but im not saying it was bad. it did have its really funny parts, trust me."
3,skip,"There was a sun spot or some stain on the label side. Playing side looked fine, still skipped about a minute of movie."
4,funny!,As long as you don't take this movie too seriously and just want a good laugh you will enjoy it!
5,Great turn-around time!,I luv it when the item that is supposed to take the longest to arrive shows up first!Thanks for the quick turn-around on this order!!
5,What a DVD,"I have atched this Movie 6 times in 2 D but laughed here and ther, but in 3 D all those surpise items flying at you I laughed the entire Movie Great Movie"
3,funny,enjoyed the movie 3d was very good over all was worth the 25 bucks would recomend not to raunchy watchable.
5,Génial!,"Livré 10 jours avant la date estimée, bien emballé.Film super, vraiment marrant et fun, la 3D est très réussie.Ne pas hésiter à l'acheter!"
3,3D is fun but the movie is cheesy,"So the first half of this movie is pretty good, it's funny enough and they do some fun things with the 3D... then the last half is about Christmas and feel-good nonsense. I'll probably watch it a few times but this is just for novelty, the movie itself is just too sappy and poorly put together."
3,Sure is a different christmas movie..thats for sure,Loved Cheech and Chong in the old days...and now we have Harold and Kumar who areholding the ship for this type of movies. Glad they made it...its sure is differentthan the others..and also has Danny Trejo in it. Nice to see this big guy smile and acting instead of breaking bones. Kinda funny little movie with a bit of nastyhere and there. There are scenes that will leave you scratching your head but bythe end the package is pretty good. I did enjoy this movie for the price of a rental
1,They lost it.,"The 3D is not that impressive here, the movie had literally about two or three funny moments that actually got just a chuckle out of me. Don't bother buying any version of this, just rent it if you really must. Harold and Kumar shouldn't be so unrealistic..too much of a family values vibe in what is so suppose to be a stoner genre film..."
3,Meh,"Yeah, so I bought this based on some reviews that the 3D is one to beat for releases in 2012. Well... I didn't really feel all that wowed by any of it. Plus, what it comes down to, unless you're a junkie, drug user type, who thinks that all humor about drug use is funny, yeah, you'll love it. But I'm not. Not a saint either, but have never done most recreational drugs used in this series. I do however, love White Castle hamburgers. Always will. So I am glad they had an appearance in this. Plus, NPH is pretty funny. I did find it odd that the 2D blu ray version and the DVD were melded into a single disc. That was an accomplishment. Never understood why I need to purchase every disc medium that's available when all I want is the 3D movie. So I often wonder... is the cost of the 3D titles high because it's 3d, or because they include 3-4 discs in each offering? Stop. I don't want them. It would also avoid doubling up on titles I've already purchased the 2D versions of. Uggg."
2,A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas,"If Cheech and Chong taught us anything, it's that stoner humor can have surprising longevity, given the right ingredients. With that in mind, John Cho and Kal Penn have taken up the mantle of the aforementioned duo and given audiences three movies of varying success, the latest of which I just saw. A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas finds our titular tokers as somewhat estranged friends, Harold having stopped smoking marijuana since getting married and Kumar having let himself go after his girlfriend dumped him. Harold, however, has promised a perfect Christmas to Mr. Perez, his father-in-law, and when Kumar accidentally burns down Mr. Perez's tree, he and Harold are again caught up in wild hijinks. Not quite hitting the highs of the first installment but certainly besting the second, Christmas offers more raunchy, irreverent laughs, and though it's still a bit hit-or-miss, I enjoyed seeing the pair's sweeter sides."
1,"Love the movie, but UltraViolet kills it!","I really enjoyed this movie, and yes it is as mature as the previous Harold and Kumar tales. But, I have to say I will not purchase this combo, because the UltraViolet digital copy only works with the Flixster streaming service. I have not been able to get Flixster nor the downloads to work for any movie that I have purchased with this UV service. If you love the movie and don't care about the digital copy, then buy it...but, if you love using didgtal copy with iTunes or Windows Media Player, then you are out of luck!"
1,Don't bother,"The first Harold & Kumar movie was hysterical, the second was passable, and this one just stinks. It tries too hard to amuse with low-brow humor, but doesn't succeed. Had to turn it off after it was apparent that it was not about to take off and redeem itself. Sad. Wish I had not wasted the money to rent it."
1,Terrible!,This movie was not even worth $1 for the rental...I had hoped for a few laughs at least but was sadly disappointed....terrible movie...not remotely funny...don't waste your time!
2,Disappointing..,"The first two movies were great, they were filled with jokes and laughter. Their jokes were racist to every group out there not just one and thats what made these movies great as they played on every race and sex stereotypes instead of attacking just one group. Now this does not offend me but may offend others.The Third movie ended up branching off completely different, I suppose thats why it had no direct connection to the past movies like they did for one another. It takes place in the future opposed to 15 minutes into the future. A poorly written film that lacked jokes and laughter. The adventure was nothing compared to the other two.Don't expect this to be the same as the last two movies and even if you haven't seen those it still won't be a great movie."
3,Meh!,"Its a typical Harold and Kumar movie..silly, full of pot references, crude humor, but really no plot (again, its a H&K; movie). Was funny at some point and stupid at others. A decent movie, but glad I did not spend the $$$ to see it in the theater.Rented through Amazon.com"
2,Shark jumped,Suit. Office. Suburb. Unfunny friend. Desire to have babies all around. Faux redemption at end. TV-caliber CGI. The toddler-on-ecstasy scene is gutless.
1,Disappointing,"Funny is not the same as reckless disregard for all things sacred. I thought jokes about bodily function were the lowest-form of comedy, but this movie has established a new bottom."
2,"Great Movie, religion jokes not so much.","I love a good comedy movie, and I enjoyed their white castle movie. This one has awesome 3D effects and very cool jokes and plot, but there is a fine line where religion jokes become offensive, and I think they crossed it."
2,low quality video,"The movie content was fine, the quality of the picture was horrible. it seems to be hit or miss with ordering videos via streaming."
3,"Not bad, but it maybe a better renter.",The movie is not bad but not as funny as the rest. It might be better to just rent. Also the blueray and dvd are on one disc. For the price you pay they should be seperate.
2,Harold & Kumar grow up,"This 3rd installment of Harold & Kumar adventures seems to have abandoned its original roots. The first two films were pure, carefree stoner comedies, while the 3rd was more like a coming-of-age tale in which the heroes often question their goofy, juvenile behavior and reflect on the possibility of becoming responsible family men. If the H & K franchise is going to bring such mawkish and shopworn concepts into the series, then this better be the final chapter. Amusingly irreverent movies such as Harold & Kumar's are better off leaving out the preachy life lesson of social conformity. As for the primary storyline, H and K accidentally destroy a one-of-a-kind christmas tree belonging to Harold's father inlaw. The duo sets out to find a replica before Harold's wife and inlaws get home. The search for the perfect Christmas tree in order to save Christmas...Almost sounds like the plot to a Charlie Brown holiday special, but with weed."
2,Jumped the Shark,"Okay the first Harold and Kumar was great! The second one was okay, but this one was just lame. Every 20 minutes or so I'd chuckle at something stupid that Kumar said and that was about it.The performances that both actors gave was pretty bland, almost like they didn't even care about the movie they were making. The only good parts of this movie were Danny Trejo and Neil Patrick Harris. They actually TRIED to give good performances and they seemed to actually give a rip about this movie. Every other actor just phoned in their performances.Plus did I really need to see Kumar's penis in clamation? And on top of that did I really need to see Harold's penis stuck to a metal pole?I really hope this is the last one of these movies that Hollywood makes. Seriously, what are they gonna call the next one, ""Harold and Kumar: Still Milking It?""If you're bored and you want something out of the Redbox, it's worth a dollar to rent it, but not worth 25 bucks to own it."
4,Great 3D Movie OK,This is a pretty raunchy movie but the 3D is awesome and Im not old enough to be offended easily!
3,My Wife was right.,She told me this would be a dumb movie. Got it because we purchased a new 3D TV and Home Theater. It was fair but basically I should've stopped with the first Harold and Kumar movie.
3,"OK Movie, Awesomely Gratuitous 3D","So, I didn't like this H&K as much as ""White Castle,"" but the intentional 3D overkill makes this a must-have if you own a 3D TV. Two stars as a ""Beavis & Butthead"" -type movie: many of the jokes do fall flat, the Jesus/Heaven scene seeks to offend (and does) rather than get laughs, and (SPOILER ALERT!) NPH should have delivered the tree instead of Santa. Major kudos for getting the legendary Danny Trejo to play the father-in-law (although he should've been allowed one knife-throwing scene just out of respect). Four stars for fantastic and funny pop-out 3D, so three stars overall. This ain't ""Citizen Kane,"" folks, so expect teenage boy humor and R-rated language, put the kiddies to bed, and bring it out every December for some 3D fun at home."
5,I WANT THIS ALBUM!!!!,"Where can I find it? Amazon doesn't seem to have it. Wishing well is quite frankly the best song I have heard in a long time. I love it. Please, could someone help me?"
5,Two Steppin' Fun,We definitely recommend this Hot Country album. Great two steppin' tunes and sweet love songs that we can all relate to. This is a great album for any true country music fan.
5,10 stars...,"abnormal, amazing, astonishing, astounding, exceptional, fab, fabulous, fantastic, heavy, impressive, marvelous, miraculous, phenomenal, preternatural, remarkable, spectacular, staggering, startling, striking, stupendous, surprising, unreal, unusual, utmost, wonderful"
3,Disappointment,"My 13 y/o daughter has been anxiously awaiting this book. Now, she feels she would have preferred to have waited longer for a more thought-out conclusion to the trilogy.She found the absence (she wasn't even mentioned)of one character disturbing. Typographical and grammatical errors were spread throughout the book. The retelling of events that occurred in earlier books wasn't always accurate. Finally, the conclusion left her saying ""What?"".Overall, she felt it was a good book, but the above listed problems took away from the story."
4,Innovative Techno/Jazz Fusion,"One of my best guy friends introduced me to the Xploding Plastix while visiting one day. Given his certain penchant for alternative rock, I was expecting much of the same, especially considering the name of the band. In actuality, the Plastix have discovered a formula to concoct a delightful blend of jazz and electonica--somewhat of a futuristic jazz, with many songs seeming apropo for a James Bond soundtrack.The drums, cymbals, and heavy bass beats are truly reminiscent of a great classic jazz song, especially ones like ""Sports, Not Heavy Crime."" Others like ""Tintinnamputation,"" though still identifiable as jazz, lay on synthesizer-esque sounds and sound completely new and different.The entire disc is a perfect middle ground--satisfying for the traditional music lover, and modern and innovative enough for a listener with modern taste.Like Bond, the Plastix are cool, unique, and always on the cutting-edge."
5,Great Integrators,"I heard them on a public radio music show (KCRW), and it immediately caught my attention. I went to their website, and listened to their streamed material, then ordered both their CDs available on Amazon. I like the way they integrate a bunch of musical styles into something that's very coherent. The tracks hold your interest, and don't feel gimmicky. My only slightly critical observation is that they need to be more complex rhythmically, because so far they have a slightly ""conventional"" rhythmic vibe. I feel they have great potential, but would benefit from looking more closely at stuff like early IDM (say, Plaid, Autechre etc.), it'll give them depth. But overall, I'm extremely pleased with these CDs. The big test is if you can listen to them for extended periods of time... my test... I throw a CD and let it play in a loop... after a few hours, I know what I'm dealing with. This passes the test. It's good stuff."
2,not what i expected,"i was compelled to read this book by the sexy title and areview in salon... which upon finishing the book i reread to seewhere i was led astray. the only truly worthwhile is chapter six, with other interesting bits scattered sparsely throughout. chapters 1-5 are such that the reader will either inherently understand the concepts, or conversely never will. fans of scott adams' dilbert principle will no doubt enjoy these chapters, finding numerous ideas to support their criticisms of management, but quite honestly i expected more."
1,The worst psuedo-intellectualism I have read in ages,"This book is the worst form of psuedo-intellectualism I have read in a long time. It is chock full of unexamined philosophical pretensions that anyone even remotely schooled in philosophy let alone educational theory would shudder before. This is a book of jargon for people that want philosophy without tears. Fundamental distinctions between cognition, learning, information, knowledge etc. are just thrown out onto the page like onions chipped into a frying pan. Unabashed by history, the book blithely sails past whole continents of philosophical work. The work seems torn between recommending more online interaction (information retrieval) and less of it with a few chants about the importance social contact slipped in as a chorus. Overall it fails by trying to be all things to all people while never offering an proper critique of technology and its social impact. Can't afford to offend the multinationals here. Possibly goood journalism."
1,"Fun, but no cigar","In reality exists a muddled world, ignoring (at their own risks) the dynamics of how people create ideas, disseminate those ideas, and recreate their own social and business fabrics. In reality, the short sound bite is king, and mapping and leveraging this dynamic is too 'deep' for most. Too bad for the species.Sharing pithy stories of human foibles of this ilk, along with a couple of successes and so-called technical how-to's, is always a nice read for a story in Wired. But very little of this tomb will help leverage the sentiency of the populace.Perhaps the long priestly robes at PARC are hiding something far more dubious than just career paths. I have heard both of these gentlemen speak, and speak well (with pointed antidotes and metaphors) they do. But someone should have given them a reality read, and stopped them from drinking their own kool-aid.I was expecting a whole lot more from both, and was sorely disappointed."
4,Information is not Epiphany,"I think personally, for me, I realized this was a pretty important book when I became rather bored with it in the middle. ""I know all this,"" I was thinking to myself. While reading it, my mind kept wandering to the social media book I'm trying to write. I kept coming up with new things to write in the book.Soon, The Social Life of Information was coated with scribbles related to my book.And then I had to laugh at myself when I realized this was a large part of JSB's & PD's point. I had all the information to come to these little epiphanies, but it was only through the social interaction of reading their book did many of these concepts gel.These thoughts gelled not because these guys were specifically telling me them, but because reading their book was part of a pattern of practice of my own in social media. Their ideas, my ideas, their experiences, my experiences and information combined to create context. Our social interaction created context."
4,provoking ideas for study in the current environment,"I got a better understanding and appreciation for the adaptation process of technology because of cultural environments. I agree with the authors' points of the limitations of technology as they are today. But as our social environment evolves and as technology advances to promote new social interactions, I do see the possibility of using bots as decision makers, of having employees work from home, and etc. The authors' assessment of the social culture as being static simplifies the dynamic interactions between social culture and technology."
4,A biased review,"I'm admittedly biased, as my web site is mentioned in this book, and I'm mentioned by name a few times in the chapter on ""Slash and Other Stories,"" but this is a really good book. It's a respectful, honest, and entertaining look at Star Wars fandom today. It covers everything from group viewings, to arguments over what constitutes canon, to fanfic, to fan films, and more. I had to skip the ""Speculation"" chapter because after only two paragraphs, I'd gotten some pretty huge honking spoilers on Ep 2, but I'll go back and read it on May 17th. The author himself is a fan, so that most likely contributes to the respectful, fun tone of this book. It's not complete by any means, and there are some major omissions that caused me to only give this a four star rating instead of a five, but still, Star Wars fans looking to read a good analysis of our culture should definitely check this out."
4,Excellent Piece of Ethnographic Research,"Anyone who does not understand the cultural impact of STAR WARS since the first of the franchise was released in 1977 should read this book. Based on extensive interviews, e-mail communications, and other exchanges with fans of the franchise, this book shows the ways in which individual fans have consumed, and continue to consume the films, as a way of defining their identities. An entertaining read as well as a theoretically important text for anyone interested in film audience studies."
4,"Uneven, but Worth it for Fans","If you're a fan of the Star Wars mythoi, get this book, no question. Parts of it are a lot of fun, but it gets too bogged down in its own pseudo-academic style sometimes. There were points in the book where I got a bit impatient with the belaboring of the point at hand, but that's a niggling point at best.Bottom line: I'm a fan, and I'm glad to have this book in my Star Wars collection of reading. You will be too."
2,Pretty Pointless,"I won't critize the author for writing this book, as his heart is clearly in it and he definitely knows a lot about what he's writing. But I don't think many Star Wars fans will find this book terribly interesting. It's like reading a book written about visiting a webpage... kinda pointless.Anyone who's in the target demo for this book (hardcore SW fans and the fan fiction community) will probably already know everything in this book. And anyone else (casual SW fans, non-Sw fans) should go nowhere near this.If you like reading copy and paste jobs of e-mails and posts sent to the author by SW fans, than you'll like the book. But then again, you can save your money and just do that for free on the Internet, can't you?"
1,Blah,I read this a bit ago and did not enjoy it at all. The author seems to spend most of her time irritating or offending the very culture she's come to study. Geisha by Liza Dalby is a much more interesting book very sadly not available on kindle but highly reccomended.
1,My Surprise!,"I have always been interested the world of Geisha, in fact, I especially liked Ms. Downer's previous book 'Geisha' so much that I immediately bought this new one.Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I received the package. The content is nearly the same as 'Geisha'! I have not had the heart to read the book, and I'm considering sending it back, if that's possible. I feel cheated. The title made me think this was going to be something new, different, to say the least.I don't know if there is anybody else who got this experience, but I am sure very disappointed!"
1,Get Dalby's book; this book is imitative at best,"This book was timed to take advantage of Goldens' ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and is (at *best*) a *very* ""imitative"", boring and dumbed-down version of Lisa Dalby's ""Geisha"". And there ain't all that much on ""Pleasure Quarters"".Save your money and buy Dalby's book."
4,Fascinating,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I purchased it at a supplemental reading item for my Japanese Literature class and was enthralled as soon as it showed up on my kindle homepage. I find the Geisha world fascinating and this book does a wonderful job of explaining how the geisha interact with female gaijin.
1,"A Christian book, but not labeled","I was horribly surprised while reading this book to my daughter that it is a Christian book. I am not Christian and would not have purchased this book had I known. This book should be clearly labeled as a religious book so that buyers know what they are getting,"
4,favorite of the week,This book is my little girls favorite of the week. She loves the story line. As a kindergarten student learning to read this book has alot of sight words that she is learning at school.
3,Mad Maddie,"I purchased this book for my 23 month old Granddaughter. I downloaded it onto my Kindle. I was looking for some easy first time reader books. This is not it. Although the story is a good one, I found the art lacking, the dialogue jumpy, and the size of the print too small to use the book as an ""I can read"" book.Instead I will read this story to her and have conversation about ""being mean"" ."
2,Not Interesting,I didn't like this book at all and no I wouldn't recommend it. It was too easy for my daughter and too short.
4,My kids love it,My kids really enjoy this book and read it every couple days. I like that it has a Christian message to it.
2,"This is a religious book, not just about anger management","I spent a bit more on this e-book than I usually do because my kids (like all children, I suspect) get grumpy sometimes and I thought it really might be valuable for us. I was slightly surprised to see a biblical quote on one of the intro pages, but didn't think too much of it. But when I got near the end and saw a picture of little Maddie on her knees praying to God for forgiveness...well, that's just a few steps too far for me. I'm glad it works for all those other people giving it good reviews, but this is *not* just a cute book about how to deal with a temper."
3,Parts that were not in it,"I ONLY GOT THE TALL TOWER WITHOUT THE 450W POWER SUPPLY THE NINE POSTS TO PUT THE NEW NEW MOTHERBOARD ON (it only had 4 posts on it) NOR THE SCREWS TO ATTACH IT TO THE POSTS. I bought the 600 watt power supply and the motherbard from the same place you are associate with. If they took the 450 watt power supply they should have either reduced the price for the tower or sent it with it so I could use it to get help I need to either get the the files for the chipset that was on my older motherboard so I can put my SATA hardrive in it or deal with the motherboard that I got from them as well. Other than those other three things, I like it.I hope you can get them to correct this problem for me.Sinerely,Marlin B. Hoge Jr."
3,What case is this?,"If this is the ANTEC PLUS1080AMG, the one that comes with a 430-watt True Power Supply, then it is an excellent deal. More info please?"
2,Amusing Salacious Old Time Rock 'n Roll/Swing Blues,"Back in the day, you couldn't come out and just sing anything that comes to mind, you had to couch them in songs with subtle titles and lyrics such as, ""Mountain Oysters,"" or er, less subtle, ""Drill, Daddy, Drill.""The problem is after all this time, they're really not that clever anymore and in particular the selections on this CD - unlike the ""clsssics"" of this sub genre like ""60-Minute Man, "" or ""Back Door Man,"" (NOT on this CD) the songs on this CD are at best amusing and really more interesting from a historical perspective.So, if you're a completist early r&b; collector or a collector of anything remotely sexual/salacious from early r&r;, then you add another star to this CD but otherwise, there are much better collections & compilations of salacious/hidden code r&b;/early rock."
3,"half large, numbers half cryptography","This book is a great book, but I think the author spent too much time on numbers, and not enough on cryptography. Yes, cryptopgraphy is 95% number theory, but much of the book was creating a library for large numbers, learning to add, subtract, multiply, and divide in their lowest levels. The last few chapters are the only chapters that get into RSA and AES.If this is what you are looking for than this book is for you, otherwise I recomend ""Handbook of Applied Cryptography""."
3,Very deep into math functions,"I was hoping to gain some knowledge concerning software development of encryption/decryption in AES. Unfortunately the book was mainly about the development of various math functions needed to deal with integers of greater than 1300 digits and how they apply to encryption. Although the source code provided was interesting, the descriptions included to support the understanding of the functions was to a depth I could not follow.Short answer: Good book, wrong content."
5,Wonderful Selection,I recently purchased this book and was very pleased. The author has photographed many things that are of interest to a variety of people. There is something for everyone in this book. I am looking forward to his next one. I think this young man has great potential.
4,Wide brim cotton hat,Its good. Its for my brother who had a brain tumor and needs the shade. Works out well.
5,A stellar collection of writings on the global justice movement!,"Kudos to the Notes from Nowhere collective for compiling this beautifully illustrated insightful anthology of essays about the global justice movement! Exploring a wide range of struggles (urban squats, communty gardens, independent media, union organizing, anti-war, anti-biotech, etc.) around the world (Argentina, India, Palestine, Mexico, South Africa, the United States, Italy and elsewhere), ""We Are Everywhere"" is an inspirational mosaic of stories about everday people working for gender equality, racial justice, economic democracy, environmental sustainability and peace. Another informative book from Verso!"
3,Sex Romp from the 80's,"Guys like this kind of thing, but it is somewhat boaring if you are a woman to watch this movie, bought it for my husband."
5,I found my new Favorite Animorphs book!!!!!!!!!,"This book rules!!!!!!!!!!! In a way, It's sorta like #11, in the way that Jake keeps on making irrational decisions. New discovery: yeerks can survive without kandrona rays by becoming a cannibal. Gross, huh? Jake, like Marco and his fear of ant morphs, Cassie and her fear of termite morphs, is now afraid of fly morphs. The chat room part is more confusing that it would be in reality. Oh, yeah, in chapter 6, the grossest thing imaginable happens to Tobias. I'd mention it, but I would completely ruin the book. If ya want to know, e-mail me. If you dare......... Osprey (""v"")"
3,It could be better.,"The book does not have enough adventure for it to be a good book. It should have fighting against the Yeeks. I think that if there was more adventure, and it had more Controllers it would be alot better."
5,bummer!,"Oh. My. Gosh. This book was really great, but I was screaming at it because of Jake and Cassie's perfect, peachy keen relationship like, hit the fan, or something. There were the usual funny/absolutely hilarious parts, and many tense, adrenaline churning scenes. To be honest, I never really liked Jake, he always seemed insecure, or whatever. But anyways, his mutal relationship w/ Cassie was like, the model of what all great friendships-loves should be like; and in this book it's destroyed, which ruins me. O.K.,O.K., I know. You're probably thinking, ""God, how pathetic can this chick get?"" I guess I'm just another hopeless romantic. Oh, well. I loved the book just the same. Caio!"
5,AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,It was a really good book. It was cool. I liked it when Jake charged through the house as a rhinoceros. I recommend this series to anyone. P.S. I'll roshambo you for book 17!!!
5,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In the start of the book Jake goes online to check his mail. What he raelly discovers is a Yeerk web page!!!! Next Jake gathersm everyone for a metting at Marco's house to check out the web page again. Then they discover that the man that created America On Line is a controller. The rest of the book is a action packed, frightening battle to find things out; if they have an allie or if it is all a trap for them!"
5,Superb!,"Jake has made an amazing discovery: a Web site about the Yeerks. Should the Animorphs investigate? If they do, they might walk into a trap. And if they don't, they'll never know if they're fighting their enemies alone. Either way, they've got to decide - because Visser Three isn't the only alien dying to meet them..."
2,No good at all.,"It seems that this book was a representation of the occasional ""writer's block"" that an author may have. This book has no substance to it, and although Animorphs is supposed to be a fantasy series, this book goes way beyond fantasy and into the ""stupid and not believable"" category. Of course, die-hard fans of the series will want to read it just because it is an Animorphs book. And do that--- but don't expect anything much."
5,Great book,"The beginning was funny and sad, becasue when the Animorphs go in the chatroom, they find a kid named gump, whoce father is a controller and he wants someone to tell him if he could free his father. Soemone sends an e-mail to Jake and is really funny. The jacket photo (you know the one inside the book) shows Jake the rhino outside around a couple of trees and grass, with a bird flying above and a sign (you know, those yellow signs which show Children playing, or men at work, or ped Xing)that shows a rhino picture on it. check my review on megamorphs two! you'll get a really cool sneak peek from me. This book was the bomb! Bo-o-o-o-o-m! ----Amar"
5,Animorphs Page,"The Animorphs page says that Jake finds a web page on the internet about the yeerks! It also says she's already written through #19, where Cassie morphs into a butterfly. Also, Jake morphs into a rhino, Marco into a snake, and rachel into a bat in future books. Also, there is a Megamorphs #2 where they go back in time to the dinosaurs and Jake morphs a T - Rex! See Ya! ;) :) :P"
4,King Black Acid - 'Womb Star Sessions' (Cavity Search),"When I just recently came across this CD,I specially remember it sounding pretty 'out there'.To best describe this band from Portland,OR is most likely as 'inventive space rock'.Has four lengthy tracks in which each one serves it's purpose well.I always thought the ten-minute opener ""The Wave"" sounded like perhaps a Hawkwind record being played backwards in a haunted house.Turns out to be a group of chanting monks being sampled.Whew!Trippy.Was sort of also impressed with the fifteen-minute somewhat pop-like ""Alone On Mars"".I,personally believe that 'Womb...' is a great unheard of(by most) CD that many people will never get the chance to hear.Prove me wrong.Should appeal to fans of Flying Saucer Attack,Spacemen 3,The Verve,Amp and Mercury Rev."
5,tennessee,i totally enjoy the old shows. ordered and received this item in excellant time. completely pleased with the purchasing process...
1,Tennesse Tuxedo-See them as they were never meant to be seen!,"The Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons(/63-/66-71 made in all)are herewith presented with just one opening segment while the rest just run into each other,with no closing segment.These eps are all culled from the first season but done and presented in this way,they are terribly dry,clinical and humourless.These cartoons worked best when they ran with other cartoons like Underdog and even Jay Ward segments from Rocky and Bullwinkle.While the cartoons themselves look very good,the only extras are some riddles and some audio outtakes from the original recording session.So while the mention of Tennessee may bring back fond memories of his friends Chumley,Prof Know-it-all with his 3D Blackboard,Yakkety Yak,Baldy the Eagle,etc.;for all you baby boomers out there I would give this DVD a WIDE pass.It is guaranteed NOT to bring back any fond memories of the show and in fact you may wonder what you ever liked about it at all.Thanks Sony for nothing."
5,The New Mass?,"This book proves:1. The ""New Mass does not involve Papal Infallibility.2. The Apostolic Constitution Missale Romanum of Pope Paul VI is null and void.3. The Apostolic Constitution Quo Primum of Pope St. Pius V is still in effect.4. The ""Tridentine Mass"" is the only Mass of the Latin Rite.5. The ""New Mass"" is new.6. The ""New Mass"" is illegal.7. The ""New Mass"" is not Catholic.8. The ""New Mass"" -- if we can believet he Council of Trent and official documents of the Church -- is no Mass at all.9. The ""New Mass"" is THE GREAT SACRILEGE."
2,Too much bass!,"These speakers are great for games, which seems to be what they were designed for. BUT, for listening to music or watching DVDs, they are terrible! There is way too much bass, and the overall sound is sort of ""muddy"". Also, there are no bass and treble knobs on the speakers, so you'd have to use your sound card's EQ (and mine doesn't have one)."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this because the image appeared to be the same one I purchased in the stores in previous years. That item was fantastic, noise maker lasted over a year, perfect length. This item hangs about 2 feet from the ground (my other cat is older and likes to lay down below batting things, definitely won't work for her), when I first opened it the noise maker stuck on and I had to tap it to stop on repeated occasions, and now a few hours later the noise stopped. If this is the same company who made the earlier product I'm very disappointed, you've downgraded quality on something that I'm sure was already inexpensive enough to make in the first place."
5,What am awesome purchase!,You know I bought my first one of these through a store. then my store stopped selling them so I found them on this site. This item allows my cats to play by them selves. it even allows me to shut my door with it on there. my cats get excercise and entertainment.
3,serious omissions,Gorgeous harmonies and chilling guitar from a band whos 70s albums were well worth searching out. I wore out one whose tracks included Unicorn out-doobying the Doobie Brothers and an unbelievably beautiful song that rose head and shoulders above the rest (which were fairly pedestrian) - Autumn Wine. Nice CD but I really wish that one had been included
3,"Adequate scope, poor mount","While the optics are OK for this inexpensive scope, the mount must be assembled by the customer and never seems very steady. Objects centered in the eyepiece will dirft out quickly and focusing is difficult because of the instability of the mount. With another mount/tripod setup this is probably a great inexpensive beginner scope."
4,Decent debut album,"First let me say that I am reviewing the US self-released album by the same name. It has the same tracklisting and is probably just a little rougher around the edges.This is a catchy cd, with some good hooks, the lead singer's voice is beautiful. My favorites are Living for This and Look at Me."
5,Uncle loves it!!!!,I bought this item for my undle and absolutely loves it. Says he forsees himself getting up late for work alot of mornings because he is up late watching the movies.
3,B western review,"For the B-western film fan this movie pack is a good value.Nothing sensational for the average film fan. But a ""Must"" for the avid collector.Enjoying Roy,John,Gene,Tex,Bob,and all the sidekicks and villains from old.Good value for the quantity of old goodies."
3,Overall thought,"Its a good collection of movies thanks that its available to us through Amazon.com.But some of the movies were not very clear, if it were clear it would help."
5,Western Classics 50 movie pack,"We gave this as a Christmas gift, the recipient loved it, she has alway been fond of the old western movies."
3,"Long-winded, exhausting and monotonous","The amount of research which went into this book must have been phenomenal but the writing style is so complex and confusing, it can be difficult to follow. This is the political and economical side of the fur trade business during the early 1800's from the point of view of John Jacob Astor and Ramsay Crooks of the American Fur Company. There is much to be learned from the book, especially relationships between the United States, England, France and Spain; establishing international boundaries; the never-ending saga of allowing (or not allowing) whiskey into the Indian country; the tense competition between the fur companies, etc. Better have a dictionary handy too as some of the wording will need defining to the average reader."
5,Excellent author,Had a lot of details but it was clear and a fast read. Subject matter concerning the wife of the president was creative. Sign of a well written book is that I'm always sad when it ends.
3,Devagar... Apesar da qualidade...,"Bom disco, mas achei-o ""devagar quase parando"" em relao aos outros discos do Bad Company!"
2,He's no Paul Rodgers,"It really kills me to hear this one. Its not that Robert Hart's original songs on this album are bad, although some tend to cross over into Michael Bolton territory, but it is the horrendous cover songs on this album. Hart makes a mockery of ""Shooting Star"". ""Don't you know know""? it sounds pretty lame. However ""Love so Strong"" showcases some excellent guitar work by Mick Ralph, its not enough to make up for the rest of the Album. Its nothing against Hart, but I'm glad that the upcoming Bad Co. CD has Paul Rodgers singing again, at last!"
1,The worst Bad Company cd,By far the worst of the Bad Company cd's. None of the tracks were worthwhile. May even have a different lead singer than Paul Rodgers. Do not buy
1,Worthless,"Without a doubt, the biggest waste of 90 bucks I ever spent.The kit comes and assembly is fairly easy, except for the fact that the glue dispensors tend to pop their tops and spill glue everywhere quite easily..Once the piece is assembled, it is flimsy, shakey, and after about a week it fell apart.Don't buy one."
2,"Mexico& Central America,16th (footprint-travelguides)","I was disappointed with this book. I have before bought travel guides (lonelyplanet/roughguides) and I enjoyed them a lot, and were very useful in my trips, but this guide, even myself being a Mexican and knowing about my country is useless, therefore I decided to buy another guide, lonely planet guides. REally there is scarce information about Mexico and well, about Central America I dont know too much, but about Mexico, not helpful,not descriptive, not interesting.It is bad organized. It doesnt have a lot of maps and eventhough there are many hotels referred on it, prices of them are not included, so you dont know how expensive it might be.I wont ever buy this kind of guides."
3,I didn't find this useful.,It's big and current but it stayed in my suitcase while I traveled with my backpack. Part of that was due to its weight and part that it was not detailed enough to be helpful to me.
3,Information overload,"This book is great for those travellers in the mid to upper price range (those tour and hotel ads every few pages can get annoying though). If youre looking for organised tours and comfortable travel then I would recommend this book. If your after a travel experience on a tight budget, then I would suggest another book. It has great background information on everything you could possibly want to know, but most times you have to sift through pages and pages just to get to the point.Overall, this is a thorough and well researched book and accomodation guide. But not for the budget backpacker."
4,Better than Lonely Planet if you are Driving,We recommend this book for RVers and other drivers. It has more to offer including hotels for all classes and even some camping places.
3,"NOT rated ""G""","Excellent in content, but the proliferation of erotic art make it unsuitable for classroom use (that is for 6th graders studying Ancient Roman Civilization). Recommended for mature viewers only."
4,An excellent primer,"I saw this documentary just before going to Pompeii. It was very informative even though made several years ago (what the heck, the eruption was in 79AD.)A good way to prepare yourself for visiting the real thing."
2,Shallow,I found this documentary very shallow. The interviews were not in depth and it would have been better to focus on specific topics and present such with more detail. I would recommend to get instead: Pompeii: Back from the Dead instead or Pompeii: The Last Day.
3,a rainy day book by a kid,I think this book has it's ups and down's. I think this is a book that could be better written. The word choice in not the best and the story could be more detailed but the book also has it's good points like the plot. The plot is very strong and leaves you hanging at the end of some chapters (actually quite a few.) It is the thing that drives the book and make's you want to keep reading. The story is set in the present on Chesapeake Bay. The main character Brady is facing some rough challenges because his neighbor's kayak overturns in the bay. Brady is left wondering whether or not it was his fault. As a 7th grader I read this book for class and was asked to find good descriptive words and it was challenging to find words that I did not know. Still you have to give the book and it's author credit because it was a good read but not necessarily heavy reading material a good book for rainy days.
4,the unknown,i am a sixth grader and i found this book i very interesting but sometimes also very sad but in the end it was good
4,Another Kid's Review,"I am a 6th, going into 7th, grader in Mass, and I was required to read The Red Kayak, so I read it on my Kindle, and I'm telling you, for softies like me, it's a hard book to read. (Spoilers next!) In the end, when Digger is talking in court to Brady, it brought tears to my eyes. For the little boy dead, for the DiAngelo's, for Brady, and for J.T and Digger. I wished to book was longer, because I felt horrible for J.T and I wanted to see what happened after they got out of the prison. I just really had a hard time reading this. I mean, don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but it was depressing."
4,"A suspenseful, ""real life"" novel about justice, family, and friendship","What would you do if everyone thought you were a hero--but you couldn't prevent a tragic death? How would you feel?What if you could have stopped a tragedy from happening? Would you keep it a secret, tearing you up inside?What if you found out that your best friends might have done something terrible? Would you protect them? Or would you tell the truth? How would you know what was the right thing to do?Red Kayak is a compelling, first-person narrative about a teenage boy learning to make serious decisions about right and wrong. Through Cummings' subtle prose, Brady's difficult decision whether to protect his friends or tell the truth isn't an easy one for Brady--or the reader."
2,A prank causes death,"A boy's anger causes tragedy. This is a book about the emotional conflict of one of the boy's friends who knows the truth, but doesn't know if he should tell. Although the boy did not intend his prank to cause a death, it did, which makes this book just a sad book. If you've been emotionally near any child's death or juvenile court situation recently, you may want to pass on this one."
2,Not well-received by middle school son,"""Oh nooo (groan), not another book where a kid or a dog dies!!,"" was the reaction from my 12-yr old son, when I gave him this book to read. Unfortunately for him, this book was the required summer reading for his 7th grade class. He unhappily slogged through it, but didn't enjoy it. After reading a few chapters myself, I have to agree. Although a well-written book, the underlying message is too similar to On My Honor, Sounder, Old Yeller, etc. (all of which my kids have had to read at some point). A kid causes the death of another kid, or a beloved dog dies, and the protagonist (usually a boy) has to learn to come to terms with death and/or the consequences of his actions. Give kids a break! Only make them read ONE book of this type; the message gets across the first time! This book might be preferable over the classics like Old Yeller or Sounder, because it is more current and today's kids can more readily identify with the characters."
4,right vs wrong with a happy ending after all,"This book was recommended to my by my middle-school granddaughter as one she read for school and enjoyed. It illustrates the difficulty kids (and adults) have trying to find the right thing, then do it."
4,I orderd for my Son,"I didn't read yet, I gave this my son first, hopefully after he done, I will read it too. A"
3,The content is great but the Kindle version is full of typos.,"""A Few Marines"" is an interesting and fun read. It is unfortunate that the publisher did not proof read the Kindle version. It is full of typos. The content is Great! While it is fiction the author peaks your interest about historical fact which if you are one of ""The Few"" will cause you to do some research. Lots of fun. (except for the typos)"
1,"Terrible Product, Terrible Company, Terrible Customer Service","This product was nearly impossible to install on my computer. It required several emails and phone calls to the company for ""patches"" and over the phone instructions. After it was completely installed it crashed my entire computer. Afterwards, the company was unreachable. They denied any responsibility for the damage (I was later told by a computer reparimen that the entry they had me make to the computer was fatal.) They also denied that their product was defective or faulty. I will never buy another product from this company or anything labeled JumpStart.....for a computer or otherwise. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
3,"""Nobody Knows"" how good this is.","Like many people, I heard of ""Jason Falkner"" after many years of listening to ""Jellyfish"". Though this album isn't the caliber of those from his former band, it is similar, and still very good. It's smart alt-pop, well constructed and easy to like. I tend to enjoy the first half of this disc more than the other, but it's all good at the very least. There's also a 12th track on the album called ""Untitled"", which is actually one of my favorites, and a great ending to a great record. As with most albums, this too gets better with each playing."
1,Monotonous and unlistenable - I threw it away,"Up till now, I have not been disappointed buying CDs based on the reviews from Amazonians. But this one changed all that. Simplistic tunes, monotonous beats -- I kept listening for the masterpiece and found myself painfully disappointed. It's not the genre - I like the Bellybutton CD, and think that Cotton Mather's latest is incredible -- I just couldn't bear this particular CD. Maybe if Falkner worked with a co-author and didn't produce his own stuff, things would improve. Until then, buyers beware!"
4,good stuff for completists,"This is perhaps the most obscure of the original outings from the Columbia Records Dylan catalogue, never showing up on cd since its vynil debut in 1973.Covering the likes of J.J.Walker (Mr.Bojangles),J.Mitchell (Big yellow taxi),P.La Farge(The ballad of Ira Hayes) and others, it shows Dylan strutting his stuff, but not quite so. Not to be missed by the completist, but the average fan might as well find it a bit strange."
4,Up Against the Wind,"The song ""Up Againt the Wind"" sung by Lori Perri is on the soundtrack by Christopher Young. You can find it in CDNow.com That's where I got mine. I looked all over the place for the lyrics to ""Up Againt the Wind"" but can't find them anywhere."
3,Another mixed bag of a soundtrack,"Like a lot of the soundtracks around this time (mid 90's) this is a mixed bag of the good, and not so good.The not-so-good would include the Bone Thugs N Harmony 'Days Of our Livez,'Sex Is On My Mind' by Blulight, 'Angel' by Simply Red, Angelic Wars by 'Goodie Mob' (I like the group, but this feels like they phoned it in) 'Come On' by Billy Lawrence, 'Hey Joe' cover version by Seal, 'The Heist'by Da 5 Footaz, and 'From Yo Blind Side by X-Man. all rather forgettable.The good are the excellent 'Set It Off by Organized Noize( very organic sounding slice of soul)'Missing You' featuring Brandy/Tamia/Gladys Knight, a really soulful full-on 'Don't Let Go (Love)by En Vogue ( which I believe was a major hit for them at the time) Name Callin' by Queen Latifah, showing that she can rip a rhyme as well as a song, and the very James Brownish Ray J ( Brother of Brandy) on 'Let It Go'.A mixed bag, but some jewels do shine out none the less."
2,Not exactly what I ordered.,"I owned this cd once and loved it, however, on Amazon I thought I was ordering the ""explicit"" version as it says in the title but for some reason I got the ""edited"" version. I didn't cancel the order in time so I'm stuck with annoying cut outs in virtually every song on the soundtrack."
5,I think this is an awesome Cd and i bought it 2 times.,I think that in over all this is an awesome cd like i said earlier. Set It Off was a little shaky and was Hey Joe... Set It Off was good after Queen started rapping but i dont think that O.N. should of done a duet with her. One or the other. Seal for me was the CD's flaw. It was a pointless pointless song that i never even bother to listen to. Sex Is On My Mind has the best beat of the CD yet i dont understand what talent the writer has. His words were to me not thought out and very simple. Missing you still makes me cry when ever i listen to it but that is because i am one out of millions of teenagers that can relate to it. All and all i thought it was a great soundtrack for a great movie.
1,The song isn't available,"A customer wrote that the song ""Up Against The Wind"" could be dowloaded at Audiogalaxy.com. But i never found it, not even when i searched for Lori Perri.It wasn't even avalable at Kazaa. Is there any way i can get this song on the Internet?"
3,Comment - needs additional comments,The description of this product as a CD-Rom is quite inaccurate. The product is a packaged code that allows one user unlimited online access to the information. I made the purchase for an online collge class and probably would not have paid for expedited shipping if I had known this.
5,PART OF A GREAT SERIES OF THE '80s,These UK collections of soulful hits are great. Particularly the '80s series. If you looking for great collections of songs from back in the days I highly recommend this one.
5,You've got to be kidding!! This is Depeche at it's finest.,Not only does it have an anthem for America's youth(blasphemous rumors) but it also contains the greatest plea for true love(somebody). I highly encourage you to continue down your road into the land of Depeche Mode. I promise you will be pleased. I know I will be forever changed.
4,Great Pack!,"Was looking for a daypack to carry my laptop and essentials on the plane, then once at my destination, using for day hikes on my trip... It is a little heavy, and I wish it had hole for a hydration bladder tube to pass through, but it does a great job protecting my laptop and the separate laptop sleeve is great when going through security check... overall a great pack!"
2,First Impressions,"After considering many brands and models in retail stores, I chose the Surge thinking it had more comfort and better workmanship. The zippers and sewing quality is really variable from brand to brand and the Surge had some of the best storage features along with the build quality. However, on my first outing this weekend, the pull tabs on both side bottle pockets tore off with little force. These are not important features but since they do have the North Face logo on the pieces that ripped off, I hope this pack lasts longer than a few outings."
5,Bag had two hidden tears,"Great bag, but came with 2 tears on the second pocket. I was preparing for a trip to England and purchased the bag for the trip. I didnt use it until I packed to go. Then when I was at the airport I noticed 2 tears near the zipper of the second pocket. I havent heard back from the seller, but until I see how they handle it...Beware of defective bags.**** review update**** the seller replied to me quickly and offered to replace the defective bag. They handle it great so far and it's really appreciated. A week Into my trip in the UK and the backpack is working out great (despite the two tears)."
4,A story about life!,"What I really like about Danielle's books is how much she fits in in a book...and 'Full Circle' is no exception! Tana's story is just gripping and portrays this girl's hard life throughout turbulent times, and how she pursues her goal and makes something of herself.I really like the way it was written and found it very interesting.I definately recommend it..."
4,Review,"I read this book several years ago, and recently purchased it for my Kindle. It was a pleasure to refamiliarize myself with the story line and the characters. One of my favorite Danielle Steel books."
3,Full Circle,"This book starts in the early 1940s, with a woman called Jean who's husband is killed in the war. She is pregnant with his baby and has a daughter called Tana.Jean has an affair with a married man. When Tana grows up she is raped by this mans son. She finds it difficult to cope with this and finds herself in a series of bad relationships which go nowhere. She meets a man called Harry and they become best friends. He helps her deal with the rape and when he is wounded in Vietnam she helps him find the will to live.This book is not as predictable as some of Steels can be. A nice read."
4,Very good!!!!,"Full Circle is a very good book. Tana becomes a widow shortly after marriage and decides to change her life. This is a sensitive, wonderful read!!!"
2,Glad we have the First Amendment,"This series of twenty-seven essays from the Feminists Against Censorship covers from the woman's perspective. The book has a tendency to drag in its middle section. It is simply too much of the same argument. Yes we know that the United Kingdom has harsh censorship laws. We know that some porn can be educational as well as entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big proponent or opponent of the genre. But I do feel that consenting adults have the right to decide what materials they, within reason, are allowed to bring into their homes and to read and purchase. This book gives the very basics of the argument but don't look for much resolution of the problem in the pages of this book."
3,Too many different opinions,Book of essays of women in the sex industry. Interesting enough but I seemed to finish essay to essay not feeling complete in my questions of women in the sex industry.
5,An Excellent Thesis,"This book has an intriguing thesis: that monotheism was not the exclusive property of Jews just before the advent of Christianity and as Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. In this group of essays, its authors explore how pagan groups successfully mastered the concept of ethical and religious monotheism in their pagan religions. Particularly illuminating are the essays ""Towards Monotheism,"" and ""Monotheism and Pagan Philosophy in Later Antiquity."" Both essays throw into crisis the whole idea that there is an essential different between Hellenistic and Christian concepts of God and divine beings. It also shows how robust late paganism was, in contrast to the Christian notion that later paganism died because of its inherent moral and spiritual weakness."
1,"Don't waste your money - poor fit, cheaply made.","I ordered these for a costume and was very disappointed when they arrived with a giant hole in the back where the seam had basically split. It if was just a matter of being defective, I would have just swapped them out, but they were so poorly made it wasn't worth it. They are not like normal hose fabrics...they are molded to ONE leg and don't stretch and reconform to fit your leg. They are meant for someone very tall and skinny. Also, the heal/foot is built in and is for someone with a huge foot. If your foot isn't huge, there will be a big bump sticking out behind your ankle where the heal should be. Also, when gently removing them after 10 minutes of trying on my costume, they flat out broke. Ripped in two pieces, clean break. Cheap and a waste of time/money."
1,This book.,"A very boring book. It goes into the very basics of Russian culture. It only had a couple pages about dating a Russian. I have been there twice in the last year, and didn't find the book useful at all. Find another book to read about Russian Culture and social dynamics."
3,"Good, but not Great","""Good, but not Great"" This game is a must have for younger kids, my 8yo triplets simply love it; and anything that challenges, or improves, thier mind is wonderful in my book! And as a 40yo, I like it too; I use it as my morning ""Brain Calisthenics"", every day with my coffee before work. The games are a bit limited to the point of semi-monotony, and more of variety should be included in any future versions. But my biggest gripe is never ending patronizing dialog, it takes forever to scroll through; and that is really frustrating when I am trying to fit in a few tests before work. My kids like the ""teachers"" boring banter, but not being able to shut it off for myself is infuriating!"
4,"Great game, too much chatter","This game is probably the most fun Wii game we have played aside from Wii Sports. Everyone in the family has a good time with it, from our 4-year old to the parents. A couple of complaints would be that it does not appear possible to have one of the kids compete against the adults, but choose Easy level tasks for the kids and Hard/Expert tasks for the adults -- that would make the competitions much more balanced.The other main complaint is that there is A LOT of chatter between attempts -- which is great when you are learning to play, but there should be a way to disable most of that chatter once you have played the game a bit."
3,"Good, but wish it had more to it",This is a good and fun game and it is challenging -- I just wish it was a little longer and had more options.
3,educational,"I got this for my 4 year old son. he's a special needs child and loves to play the wii. the game is too advanced for him, and he needs help. i get migraines and have a hard time helping him with it. the game is based on response time to the answers instead of on the actual answer. so my son scores low during the tests. it's still a good game, just challenging for our family due to health restrictions."
1,I want to launch the professor into the sun.,"Yes... he really is THAT annoying. The mini-games are very repetitive. They have maybe 3 or 4 forms for each ""category"". The only things that change are the numbers\layout. I bought this game for my 7 year old and his general evaluation was ""That guy is annoying... can I have a popsicle?"". LOL"
2,Not worth it for adults,"Huge downfall to the game is its lack of minigames. 15-20 for this game, versus over 60 when mario party 2 came out. Really disappointingMy GF and I, both mid 20's, thought the brain age series was worth a try. I had played a ds version in a store and liked it. This game is no better than the ds version. We also bought it to be used as a bonding experience.This game made bonding worse. It relies more on the speed of your clicking icons/answers than it does using your brain. I dominated her because of my experience with the wiimote versus her first experience with a console system. Everytime I beat her in a game that measures your intelligence made me feel more guilty when i won because it seemed to lower her self esteem with each win. Not to mention the 2 player games require you to pass the controller around instead of using your own.rent this and you prolly wont buy it."
4,Fun for the family,"Nice concept, fun for the family. Some levels are pretty hard. Would recommend. Stimulating !Worth the money."
5,Love this,"I'm new to Wii, but so far this has been my favorite game. I've played it, my husband's played it. Even my 5 year old daughter has played it. Its even fun for us because after you create Miis they show up in the game. It's got games one can play in pairs or games one can play alone. It's fun to see the test results and to practice the different skills.Perhaps it could be perceived as silly because of the owl and the brain weight; but all in all it has been the most fun game we've all played together."
5,I beat my girfriend in Wii Degree. (It was a proud moment),"The Wii degree was fun, especially with a couple or group of people.Just don't have hard feelings afterwards, its just a game!"
4,good exercises,Wish I could bypass the little prof babbling incessantly while moving to different portions of the academy. Other than that it is fine.
4,back to school!,"Summer's ending, kids long ago gave up on doing workbooks & writing in their journals. What to do to get their brains in gear before schools starts up? I ask myself.Enter Brain Academy. Right now there are 4 kids aged 6-9 whooping it up on my Wii, doing some simple math & visual tasks - 2 of them have ""bigger brains"" than me, lol!Fun, good for a rainy day especially, and IMO much better use of time than many other ""games"" out there."
1,Disappointing,I was looking forward to this as I love Brain Age for Nintendo DS. But the professor who speaks to you is so discouraging. He accuses you of being a slowpoke in life and then he says you set a record. My 7 year old says that the professor is dumb. My 9 year old won't play it anymore after playing it twice. I find that my ability to play varies widely from day to day and I don't think it is my brain function. It is more likely related to how quick I can press the remote. I am remarkably consistent on Brain Age for Nintendo DS and Wii Fit where I see steady improvement. I do not recommend this game.
5,"Big Brain Academy, Possibly the Best Wii Game!","Big Brain Academy is awesome! Big Brain Academy requires reflexes, smarts, and memorization. You need to work hard to get a good grade. I haven't gotten a perfect score yet but I think it will be worth it. It is really good family fun. You can pick up some skills from Big Brain Academy and it will be fun to practice and then challenge your friends and beat them at it. Unless of course they have the game too. Almost all of my family has signed up for Big Brain Academy and we can play it for hours! I don't regret getting the game at all and I highly recommend it."
2,"If you don't mind verbal abuse , this is a good game.","I asked the Grandparents to buy this for my 8 yr old. We've only played it a few times. I can see how the games could be fun and beneficial. Overall, we really dislike the game. It's annoying because there's a lot of time wasted waiting for the game character to make some haughty or rude comment. I've yet to see any worth reading. If a teacher treated kids this way- they'd be fired. My daughter cringes when the character comes on the screen. Even in the practice mode, the screen character could make a crack about how she must be half asleep. After a game, it can make comments about how the other team members must be disappointed in her. There are gentler ways to criticize. How about just ""That wasn't very good, but just keep trying- you'll do better next time.""? I wish there was a way to turn off the comments- then we'd all enjoy the games much more. In summary, if you enjoy haughty comments and don't mind verbal abuse- this is a good game."
4,Big Brains,This game is challenging and takes a good bit of concentration. My kids love it and are getting better and better at it.
2,Not Enough Variety,"This game is fun, but it lacks enough multiplayer activities, there's only one mode that allows the use of two remotes. There are only 15 minigames to play and none are really that great. For a DS game this might be acceptable, but on the Wii, for $50 I would expect much more variety in the minigames. There isn't really much to do in this game, but it's cool how it ranks your brain in 5 different categories. Overall, I would not suggest it because there is not enough to keep you occupied."
2,Kind of boring after awhile,About 15 different games to test your brain. After awhile it gets kind of tedious. Not worth $50 bucks.
3,Not enough variety,"The activities that are on the game are fun, but there is not enough variety and they quickly get ""old"""
2,Not Fun,"This game was not very fun, it was kinda boring and too much reading. If you want a fun game that is similar to Movie Scene It, get Smarty Pants!"
4,A good buy from good store ..,The game is good and entertaining.I wish we could control the speed for the young ones to gain competative spirit.
3,The Great Brain Drain,This game is great for sheer entertainment purposes. Gather the baby boomers around and challenge one another. It makes for great laughs. However on the downside there are some challenges that there are no directions on HOW to do them.Great game for entertaining.
4,Brain Fun,"As long as you are not graphics fan, and you look at it from the technical brain stimulation, you will like it. Graphic Characters and text display are poor. All games, in all five categories are playable by kids to adults. The best part is, all games are time based scoring. This adds the real pressure to the brain than the actual game.Over all its a nice must have game, but needs graphics and text display improvement."
4,Fun for all!,"I'm a 'puzzle-and-game' freak so this was a must-have for me. I had a ton of fun but wish there were more games to do. All-in-all, a thumbs-up!"
5,awesome game,This is a great game to play with your kids...it tests all aspects of the brain and it is really fun.
4,Big Brain Academy,"I tried Big Brain Academy at my friend's house and immediately knew I was going to go buy it. First you enroll your Mii in the academy, and then take a fun test to see the ""weight"" of your brain. When playing by yourself you can practice all different subjects including computing, memorizing, visualizing, identifying, and more. You can also re-test once you feel you've gotten better at the subjects. There is also a brain quiz, which mixes all different aspects of the test but you can play it with friends and see who will get the higher score. You can also compete with friends one on one."
4,"Fun, Sometimes A Little Easy","This game is a lot of fun in a group, and some of the games really challenge you. However, some of the games are a little too easy (on the Easy level of the game). The individual test is fun, and constantly pushes you to try harder. Though once you know the games, you will see that some of them are repeated."
4,Be quick!,"Very reactive game, puts your brain to the test. Delightfully stressful when competing with your sister! Lots of fun."
1,Awful,This is absolutely awful. Game is quite boring and lacks the ability to save your profile. This means every time you have to power up you have to register a profile. My children are ages 6 through 11 and this will not do for either of them. WII Word coach is the only good one that they sell as far as I can tell so far.
1,Amazon STINKS!!,I preordered this game from Amazon THREE WEEKS before the release date and I receive the game a WEEK after the release date! WTF is the point of preordering something weeks in advance if you get it late?
3,Big Brain Academy,This game was fun at first but it did become boring after about the first day for me. Also some of the tests were challenging for me as a Senior in High School so I could see younger kids having a lot of trouble with some of them. Overall I think it would be fun for younger kids but I think even they would get bored after a couple days
4,Big Brian Academy review,"Very nice and enjoyable game for the whole family.As opposed to other Wii games, this one requires more mental energy than physical. Grownups enjoy it just as much as teenagers do."
2,Mostly Horror--Little Occult,"Mix in a little supernatural, a lot of guns (big guns!) and a lot of violence. Forget plot, it is a vehicle to string together the shoot and bang. The premise of this movies could have been good, but sorry it takes a story with some dialoge to carry it and this one doesn't have it."
2,Guardians,"This movie was so bad that I did not finish it. I have a pretty open mind when it comes to science fiction, but this movie just did not cut it."
4,Cool occult thriller!,This movie was a finalist for best sci-fi feature at Shockerfest. Great action. Cool plot. Decent acting.
1,This is not Buddy Rich!,This is not Buddy Rich! Someone made a huge mistake here....The recording is a jazz-lite/fusion band of some sort. Please take this off the website! The photograph is the correct cover of the 1974 LP though.
4,This is a good album.,"I've been listening to this album every day in the car, and most of it makes me really happy. Occasionally the ""quirkiness"" of the lyrics surprises and delights, occasionally it just throws me for a loop (the moon is an ovum/we are sperm...??!) but overall the songs are catchy and melodic and I find myself whistling or singing them around the house.This CD is a real leap forward from the previous 2 Jackpot CDs (in my humble opinion) and is garnering the band a lot of well-deserved attention and radio play. I was sad that I didn't see my favorite song of theirs from live performances (something about a blue suitcase?) on the CD, but there were other, new tracks that more than made up for it. ""Big House"" and ""Tattoos"" are beyond fabulous and into sublime.It all reminds me of Whiskeytown and Wilco more than the bands others have mentioned, but it isn't alt-country - it's clearly rock-n-roll. Highly recommended, and I look forward to their next offering."
4,Shop for price !,"Good apparent quality, prompt vendor service, not unreasonable (reseller) price...but, after ordering, I did find better price from (claimed) manufacturer. This source does appear to be actual manufacturer as product delivered to me actually looks more like product on manufacturer website (black) than vendor website (white)"
4,Working great.,"I'll keep an eye out for how long it lasts but it's working well now. Heating is consistent and quality of the product, itself, is excellent."
5,Great Chicken heaters,"It can get very cold in my area and having chickens can be challenging, especially trying to keep their water from icing over. I have 2 waterers (metal), one inside the coop and one hanging outside and had trouble as soon as the temp dipped down to 20 degrees. Bought a pumice block and stepping stone, hubby made it so I could fit a ceramic light fixture inside, then set the inside waterer so it just hangs on top (for leveling). Turned it on and it works like a charm, also keeps the right temp inside the coop. The outside one was more challenging, so also had the ceramic/block set-up, set the waterer on top, but this time wrapped an electric heat cord (at least 5 wraps) and plugged both in, and it also works great. Temp has gotten down to 2 degrees and as long as I keep the waterers full, no freezing."
2,its ok,This product is ok but it didn't give off enough heat for my 10 gallon tank I still have to put another heating lamp to get my tank at the right temp
1,3-4 month life,"Exo Terra, if your going to put a product out be truthful on how long it will last. I bought 2 and both went out in 3-4 months. A lot of money spent on a poorly made product."
2,Poor design,"After 2 months the end came apart, the other 3 have lasted longer, but for the amount spent I would not buy again."
1,Avoid these heaters.,"I purchased two of these heaters. They worked great for the first month - then I noticed that one of my units was putting out 1/2 the heat as the other one. Within another few weeks, the other unit had the same problem. Go forward another month and now both units are completely dead. I have to think there is a better product out there."
3,Whitman Poetry Lovers only,"If you are a Whitman poetry lover (or aspire to be), this is an interesting book. The author explores the manifold influences on Whitman's writing, from Opera to Phrenology (and all the other letters of the alphabet), and uses snippets of poetry to prove his points.I had not explored Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" before reading this book, and was looking for a portrait of Whitman and his times, not a compilation of ""influences,"" A to Z. In short, I found it dull. The author's writing style doesn't help either, which is straightforward at best, pedantic at worst (""No other biographer has noted..."").If you love Whitman's poetry, by all means buy and read this book. However, if you are looking for a more straightforward biography or a picture of America in the age of Whitman, you might look elswhere. Please, tell me what you find!"
1,It was a terribly worst choice.,I have ordered a USB mouse but they send me a PS/2 type mouse. Even worse they didn't give me any answer for my request for the refund.
4,Good Times,"This was a fun read.Lots of characters, with lots of plots that all end up at the same place for a happy ending.The characters are gritty, persistent and likeableThe story is a humorous, quick read."
1,no point.,This book was pointless. The chapter jumping was difficult to understand. The books plot was thin and not very interesting. The characters were uninteresting and boring. I love Sharon Sala books. but I had to force myself to finish this book!!!!
2,Too Many Characters,"Have read several books by this author, however this one has been my least favorite. I have not read the sequel and probably will not."
3,Could not really get into it,"I usually love Sharon Sala's books. However, in the prologue she tells us this is not one of her usual books. And it is not.This is a different type of book for her. It has very well drawn characters but I just did not come to care for them as much as I usually do.Of course it is set in the west at a time of struggle and fighting as well as many decievers.A saloon girl, a fraudulant preacher, a gambler and a drunk, each has his or her life changed in a split second. When the unscrupulous preacher dies in the lady's bed.There is humor and irony aplenty in this book. Somehow where there is a will there is a way.At the end each is redeemed by their experiences. The ending is somewhat ambiguious and did not really satisfy me.Everyone should be able to stretch their wings and Ms Sala certainly changed from our usual expectations."
2,Very Different,"I normally love Sharon Sala books, and, at the beginning of this one I though I would like the different setting in the timeline. But I really could not get in the story and I did not really like the way it ends. The characters were interesting but I think she could have givin us a little bit more of their history, of why they ended in that town"
5,pugster,I've ordered from Pugster before and I will do it again. Great quality and great delivery time!!
5,Solid Pro DarBoard,"This is my first review on Amazon and only took the time because this dart board has been so solid. I have played with light 16 gram darts and the heavier 20 gram darts and have not had one dart bounce out so far. Plus, the colors on the board are very bright which is a plus and the led lights used for cricket are easy to see from a distance. The only complaint I have about this dartboard is the bulls eye that rotates when a heavier dart hits it. Not sure I understand why they added this to the board but they should remove that in their future boards. It kind of changes the game when you hit the bulls eye and it moves but otherwise, this is an awesome board."
4,Dart board,"More games on it then I'll ever play. Mounting was a little challenging, have to get creative. Darts are ok. Tips break off easily and the tails come off constantly. Ended up getting different darts. Easy to play and darts stick well."
5,Arachnid Cricket Pro 650 Soft-Tip Dartboard,"I shoot darts weekly in league and i wanna tell you this board is exactly like the Arachnid ones you shoot on in the bars except you have to hang it on the wall. Great options,voice is dumb,startup jingle is really dumb,very few bounceouts(probly cause i know how to shoot),darts that come with it suck but if your buying this board you already have a good set. voice and jingle can be turned off btw. Very easy to hang but i suggest using your own screws to hang this cause the ones that come with it are VERY cheap. We had two of them break in half hanging this up. The board works as intended and aside from the minor gripes it will get the job done and work just as good as the bar Arachnids."
1,poor quality,Was given as a present. This board worked ok for about 10 times. After that the lower single of the upper right quadrant stopped working. Not only that darts often do not stick. For the price this is poor quality. Would not consider buying this board or this company again.
4,Good but complicated,"Finally a dartboard that works! Had many irritating visits to various stores that resulted in returns. Really love this board. It does what it is supposed to, good quality. I just wish I didn't need a manual to figure out what games are what. After a while you get to know the games you play regularly, not a huge deal."
3,Disappointed,"LED center lines don't light up, otherwise works as advertised. Very difficult to read LED. Mounting instructions and included darts are of very high quality."
4,nice dartboard,"i've only had it for a couple days but the dart board itself is a little bigger than i expected which is by no means a bad thing, scoring and LED lighting is very nice, though there have been a few bounce outs and a bit hard to get out of the boards after throwing but nothing drastic, overall nice dartboard and i recommended it to anyone who wants to get a non-arcade style dartboard"
3,It is OK - really need better darts,"This dart board is as expected and easy to use. It seems reasonably well built. I gave it 3 stars, because the darts are awful and pulling the darts out of the board is very diffciult. With that said, I would definitely recommend this brand over any other brands I looked at."
1,Received this electric dart board with no accessory pieces including the power cord and no time to replace it before Christmas!,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my kids. I received only the dart board in a box with none of the accessory pieces including the power cord and it is an electric dart board!
5,Best Buy. A must for Racers,This product does everything it says it will do. I never had such handling before. Really good for high speed driving.
2,Tourist writing too fast...,"I've got to agree with several of the other reviews that this is a poor book about the southwest, he did seem to get facts wrong or what I have learned from over 25 years living here was wrong - the Anasasi are always refered to here as ""The Acient Ones"" never the ""The Enemy Ancestors"". I got the feeling that during his visit here people were just putting him on, he was falling for it and put it in this book. This book reminds me of ""The Solace of Fierce Landscapes"" by Belden Lane who was also not a desert resident, from St Lewis, but trying to write a meaningful book about the desert. You need to live in the deseret for a long, long time before it 'happens' to you, and for most people it never does. To think you are going to go on vacation and then write a meaningful book about the desert is completely missing the point. Come out and sit on a rock for ten years - then write.An additional point to note is that a golf course is the negation of the desert."
2,legends of the non-editor,"As many other reviewers note, Shoumatoff's powerful writing and great notes of research are really derailed in many parts here, beset with numerous inaccuracies -- the parts on the Sonoran Desert and the O'odham people, for example, as well as the Tarahumara and the Sierra Madre, beg for a local copy editor. It's really a shame; there's a lot to like in this book, and I would suggest reading it...but the usually astute Shoumatoff has set himself up as a typical, loose cannon travel writer, coming to some dubious conclusions about places he only knows as a short-sided visitor."
3,Legends of the American Desert,"Mr. Shoumatoff writes well and entertainingly about one of the most intriguing places on the planet--i.e. the American Southwest. One thing that bothers me, though, is that I found at least one misspelled word--the car's name is Karmann Ghia and not Carmenghia as he (and, presumably, his editors) spelled it. Further, I found what I believe to be a couple of factual errors. Nevertheless, if you're interested in an entertaining view of the Southwest, you can't go wrong with ""Legends of the American Desert."""
3,A Little Suspect,"I've explored a little southwestern desert over the 19 years I've lived in the West and believed I was learning from the book and was certainly enjoying it. I discovered an error that tipped me off to do a little research here on what I was reading. As I learn of all the other errors, the book now seems a little suspect. I'm scratching my head wondering if I should continue. I think not, even though I was truly enjoying it.P.S. The author referred to the place where the Mormons, in search of a short route to the Pacific, chipped and dynamited their way through the redrock canyon wilderness near Escalante, Utah, approaching the Colorado River, to make room for their wagons and handcarts.The author referred to that place as ""Hole in the Wall."" It should be ""Hole in the Rock."" Hole in the Wall is a place in Johnson County, Wyoming where Butch, Sundance and assorted outlaws used to hide from the law (the members thereafter known as ""The Hole in the Wall Gang"")."
1,They don't stay in your ears!!,"These earrings are very pretty, and they thread through your ear just fine, but they have one majory design flaw... there is nothing to keep the thread from continuing to slip through your ear, until it falls right on out!The weight of the crystal pulls the thread down, and gravity does the rest. I tried all different ways of attempting to get these things to stay put... even tried to tie a knot behind my ear as an improvised backing. You can imagine how well that worked!Very disappointed."
5,Buy this CD right now,"This is one of the most amazing albums I've ever been fortunate enough to experience. KBA is really on to something here-- the whole CD consists of three very long tracks, each one focusing on one distinct rhythm without much singing. It allows the band to find basically one good sound for each track, and let it gradually develop into something very powerfully emotional and unforgettable. You won't be able to get this stuff out of your head for days after you listen to it, and eventually it sort of becomes like the musical score for daily life.Just buy it. It's that good."
4,King Black Acid - 'Sunlit' (Cavity Search),"Looks to be King Black Acid's second effort. About as good as 'Womb Star Sessions' (see my review). This is just plain good 'ol dreamy space-like rock. Three lengthy tracks, are ""Some Things Must Be""(20:35), ""Headfull""(18:10) and ""Think Away"" (21:49). Personnel: Roger Campos-guitar&vocals, Daniel John Riddle-guitar&mixing, Geoff Harrington-keyboards and Scott Adamo-drums. Sit back at drift way-off in another atmosphere. Nice!"
4,wood mallets,They were a bit shorter than I expected but they get the job done-- bought for my 2 year old who had a very nice set of resonating bars
1,PAL format and Region 2 only !,"This DVD (front cover picture with green background) is in PAL format, not NTSC and works for Region 2 only. This will not work on Region 1 DVD players.Updated 5/15Amazon, thanks for making correction."
4,FAMILY FUN,"BIG RED is a film your family should enjoy viewing together. The dogs are beautiful and ""act"" quite well; Gilles Payant, in spite of the hard to decipher French accent, brings an innocent joy and commitment to his role; Janette Bertrand as Theresa, the housekeeper, is fitfully feisty and endearing; and Walter Pidgeon is good in his transformation from heartless showman to caring father figure. Unfortunately, the characterizations are merely anecdotes to the lush scenery and shenanigans of boy and dog, and result in a tedious, sometimes dull narrative. However, it's heartwarming and enjoyable. Certainly not one of Disney's best but a refreshing tale in this day of special effects and low moral films."
1,Not viewable in my region,You sent me a dvd that is only viewable in the UK. What can you do to correct this situation?
1,Wrong format,"While I thought I had carefully selected a DVD that would play in a USA DVD machine, I apparantly ended up with a European, PAL format. Now I am trying to figure out how to return it."
3,"Nice movie, the book is much better","while this is a nice movie, it does not follow the original story line of the novel, Big Red. This is why its only getting 3 stars. Not one of my favorites either, since they could have done so much better then this movie. Seems like they took Big Red, and outlaw Red and combined the two books together, then scrapped all the main characters, except for Mr haggin, and Red. The few scenes that do follow the book are also wrong. The dog show is supposed to take place in New York(westminister kennel club, I do believe), the wintapi is set in the wilderness in PA, not canada. Red has no affection for MR haggin at all, only for the two characters that should have been in the movie(Ross, and danny pciket). Instead of the showdown at the end between Danny, Red and Old Magesty the bear, we get him fighting a cougar. Red ends up injured, and Mr Haggin gives(or sells, don't exactly remember) the dog to Danny in the end, in exchange for breeding rights to him."
4,Tough and user friendly,"I've owned one of these Sheffield 12000 Multitools for a few years and it's fantastic. It's the main tool I use at home. The pliers work extremely well, and the spring is great for keeping the tool in proper position. The spring does make it so the tool doesn't stay closed when I close it, but I don't carry this one anyway. It's strictly for home use, and it works very well. The knife blade is well shaped and holds an edge, tool selection is well thought out. Bottom line is the tool is quality, and for a low price. I plan to buy a couple more to place around the house."
2,Ok for a cheap multitool,Pliers: Spring opens smooth. Tips are way off (not lined up).Tools: All the tools snap into place ok.Handle: The worst part. The grip is uncomfortable because your hand holds onto 4 metal edges that dig into your hand. It kind of hurts if you try to get a strong hold.Overall this multitool is poor quality and I wish I saved the $8 and put it towards a leatherman. However it does function at its price point.
3,Probably not up to a tough job,"This is very much a ""you get what you pay for"" tool. It's cheap, and the quality is visibly not that good. I think it'll be fine for light-duty tasks, but don't expect to be able to apply a ton of force to anything. Some of the cast fold-out pieces have flashing still on them. On the other hand, the knife is fairly sharp, and all the tools fold out and lock fairly well. Probably best as a backup tool or for the glovebox - if you have to really rely on it, I'd say spend the money on something a bit nicer."
4,Really Sweet Indie Rom-Com,"Saw this cute indie on at SDBFF , and the house was packed! Really cute on the big screen and had me rolling :) Just glad to buy a copy today... cause I have been waiting for it forever! Finally, someone did a # JohnHughes movie with a thick black woman... holla"
5,Your cat taps this mouse and it squeaks!,"My cat adores this toy! When she paws at it, it makes an electronic squeaking noise that sounds like a real mouse!It also has this slight bouncing action that makes her think it's alive. I don't know what it is made of, but there is something about the texture of the mouse that her sensitive paws really like!She is endlessly fascinated by this mouse. I only have one, so I am careful to watch it as she loves to bat it underneath furniture. Given that she is 10 years old, any toys that make her play this hard are always worth the money!She loves to hunt it, stalk it, bat it about the room, and then she skitters away at a hundred miles an hour. It's a riot! I highly recommend this one!"
1,play and squeak mouse,"Can not hear the squeaking! Maybe my cats can hear it. Either way, they don't even play with it.Save your money."
1,Offensively Dull,"For some reason, the author is far more concerned with what her characters are wearing than with what they are doing. The magic portrayed in the book is a smarmy and very dull brand of Western Mystery Tradition occultism. The portrayal of Scottish people is sterotypical and patronizing, and in Gaelic areas of Scotland the characters are not portrayed as Gaels, but as the same stereotypical lowland Scots. Every scene was so agonizingly dull that to continue reading was almost literally painful. In other words, I don't recommend this book!"
2,Didn't quite work for me.,"A bit like reading a Hardy boy mystery, only the boys have occult powers. Seemed a bit juvenile. If you have some youngsters around the house that you would like to introduce to the occult then maybe..."
1,Is this Katherine Kurtz or Car and Driver?,"I love the Deryni series and bought this book thinking it would be another fun Katherine Kurtz novel. While there are elements of Ms. Kurtz style and knowledge throughout, I tend to think that the co-author, Ms. Harris, is, for some reason, absolutely obsessed with cars. For some bizarre reason she spends endless paragraphs throughout this book discussing the features and merits of the cars driven by every character and this peculiar digression completely detracts from the book. The rest of the series is equally as odd and it got to the point as I was reading, that I kept wondering to myself, ""so how is she going to get in the details on the car"" and it became a self guessing game. (When, in one of the novels, he actually has to BUY a car.... well, you get it!)Basically, this whole series is total drivel and not worthy of Ms. Kurtz. Dont bother buying it as it will only irritate you."
3,"DVD,CD Repair Kit","THE KIT IS FUNCTIONAL BUT WHEN IT COMES TO REPAIRING SCRATCHES, I RECOMEND NOT DOING IT. YOU WILL SCRATCH THE DAYLITES OUT OF IT AND MAYBE RUIN THE DVD,CD IN THE PROCESS."
3,entertaining,"Mission: Impossible II wasn't as good as the first Mission:Impossible, but it was still fun to watch. It has a good soundtrack."
3,Typical Cruise Movie,"it was ok. Passed the time one afternoon. Retread of a tried and true story. Can't hardly miss. I prefer finding new ideas but sometimes ya' gotta please the family, too. :-)"
3,My least favorite of the series,"We hadn't seen the series in a while, so went back to watch them. This was OK as far as movies goes, but it doesn't reach the level of action and story as the others in the series."
1,are you kidding,"The History Channel puts out basic propogandist disinformation! I give this and all other of their so-called research films ZERO STARS!* My experience while watching History Channel specials causes me grave concern for American logic. They contradict themselves repeatedly,skip over and omit critical evidence and use illogical sequences in order to mimic true scientific evaluation. The greatest damage this theatrical troop produces, happens when they use phsycological word tricks aimed mainly at the 'Judge Judy' fan-base..... *NOTE I wasn't given the choice of zero stars by Amazon!"
3,its ok,kind of disappointed in the length of the movie it was full of information and shipped pretty fast history does have good quality just wished it was longer
1,Shame on the History Channel,"Don't waste your time on this over-hyped DVD. I really expected something with more intelligence and integrity coming from the History Channel. Basically, one witness was revealed, his story was either bogus or proved to be a dead-end. End of story as far as this History Channel DVD goes. They concluded Roswell was a hoax based on one person's testimony. Very poorly done. Whether you believe or not, the point is this was very shoddy work and not worth the money or time. Next time, I'll pay more attention to how other viewers have rated items. Look for more credible investigators/scientists to explore both sides of the story in an intelligent fashion. I wasn't looking for an answer as to whether or notRoswell really was the site of a UFO crash, but was at least hoping to garner some new details and probably create some more questions and theories of my own. This DVD provided none of that. Shame on the History Channel--this was just a money-grab."
4,No More Magic - Mrs.McCormicks 6th Grade Class,"This book is a fiction book. On Halloween Chris's bike got stolen after he went trick or treating. The next day he started to investigate and thought Eddie stole his bike because he said he was going to be at the Halloween parade, but he wasn't. To him, this made Eddie a suspect. Chris went to the junk yard to see if he could buy a bike. He got one cheap because his got stolen. That night he saw a warlock riding his bike. The next day he met this girl, Muffin. She didn't have a bike so Chris took her to the junk yard and asked Mr.Bullen to sell a bike to Muffin for a cheap price. Mr Bullen said no at first, but ended up selling her one anyway. The author of this book is AVI. In the beginning, I thought this book was a boring book, but at the end it was good."
4,No More Magic - Mrs. McCormick's 6th grade class,"This little boy named Chris went to Halloween by himself and when he came back, his bike was stolen. His mom took him to get a new bike but he didn't want to. His mom took him to the junkyard to look, but they didn't find anything. He thought it was his friend Eddie that took his bike. He went to check at Eddie's house, but the bike was not there. The next day, he met a new friend named Muffin. The next day, they went to school and Eddie asked, ""Do you want to play?"". Chis said ""I'm going home"". Chris' teacher is Mr. Bullen. Muffin wanted a bike so Chirs asked Mr. Bullen if he would sell Muffin a bike. He said he would, but Mr. Bullen wanted her jacket. Muffin wouldn't give it to him. He ended up selling her the bike anyway. I didn't really like the beginning of the book, but by the middle it got much more better."
1,No More Magic,"I am a student at Waldron Mercy Academy (DAB). I read the book No more Magic. My opinion of No More Magic is that it was really bad. I didn't like it because it's just about a boy and at Halloween he leaves his bike outside. A ""warlock"" comes and steals it. He and his friend Eddie meet a new girl and become friends. They go out to look for his bike. Along that time he tells the police to look for his bright green bike,and that it was stolen by a ""warlock."" The police thought he was joking so they apparently didn't belive him. I thought this book was horrible because it was stupid and unexciting. It didn't have any meaning to it either."
2,What a waste!,"Although entertaining (2 stars), the film is heavily biased without as many facts as they want you to believe (0 stars for content). Love that I can learn how 9/11 really unfolded for only $2.99 ... maybe choose a different film this evening."
4,Great deal on very good dual purpose camera.,"I've had the 50U for 3 years and it has never disappointed me. It is compact, rugged and handsome. The quality of the movies is excellent (mini DVs), and the quality of the still pictures is good (though not as good as any of the >2 megapixel cameras available). The drawbacks, as I see them, are the expense of the media (the mini DVs for film and the MultiMediaCards for stills are about the most expensive choices around), the limited still photo resolution (yields slightly grainy 5 x 7s), a fairly noisy motor, and an eyepiece cover that tends to allow blowing dirt or sand to enter the optics more frequently than I'd like. Nonetheless, the 80U, adding image stabilization, makes this camera an all-around winner, and at this price too good a deal to pass up."
3,Tape incompatibility!,"I got the camcorder about a month ago but only spend about 2 weeks with it because it was in the repair shop most of the time. It seems that this camcorder is incompatible with TDK tapes. There were no mention of it anywhere in the manual or in the packaging. They should at least include a recent updated notice on the problem. After using the TDK tape for 15 minutes, the picture became distorted and the message ""Head cleaning required"" appeared. I took it to the shop and the technician said the video heads were damage and need to be replaced. After calling JVC on the phone, they told me alot of people had call in about the same problem. I'm surprised no one mention it in their reviews or I would have stay away from the TDK tapes."
1,Very sensitive to tape brand - it turns your camara useless,"Do not buy a JVC camcorder!!! - Just a couple of months after buying a JVC GRDVM80U an ""E04"" error start popping in th screen. Apparently the machinery is very sensitive to tapes lubricants and other compounds. Cleaning the head is not enough - the camara just becomes useless (Well, you can probably fix it for $350, but then it will break down again soon) Search the web for ""E04 JVC"" and you'll know how frequent and fustrating this error is - and I was surprised to learn it is not restricted to this model. JVC just ignores the problem and blames the tape manufacturers. It might function as an average camera if you are willing to give up using a tape ... and recording."
3,Good Camera Not So Great Still Picture Quality,"My friend owns a JVC GR DVM80U and says it takes terrible still pictures but excellent motion video the still picture's the camera takes are extremely low resolution (blurry, hardly any detail pixels noticeble). After he bought this camera he had to go out and buy a digital camera. Which was about 100% better still image qaulity overall this camera is good but if you are looking for a motion video/still camera you will have to wait longer."
5,Great buy for the money !!! Be in the movies!!!,"This is a great buy, especially at 42% off list price. It is compact and user friendly. The number of features, add-ons such as editing software, cables, etc. is more than you get with any other camera. I looked at the JVC vs. the Sony line and chose JVC for value --- after having a Sony Hi-8mm camcorder before. It's a great digital camcorder to get started with, and probably for most the only camcorder they need."
3,What is the value of an interesting snapshot compendium?,"The factors influencing branding are changing so dynamically most of the historical references are going out of date quickly. My opinion is that many of the brands you see leading in this book will likely be replaced by companies that are really paying attention to the possibilities of the future, rather than just reading about the past."
2,run of the mill coming of age tale blah blah blah,I really hoped this was gonna be a good one. Its about a teenage boy who has an affair with his teacher and they runaway with an eccentric anarchist. It sounds entertaining. The plot is interesting. The writing is decent. The problem is that Tussing is horrible at writing and developing characters. They are so flat. It would probably make a good movie but its not enough to make a good book.
1,"wets the appetite, not much else","I have been wanting a scope for some time and finally my wife just went ahead and bought this scope for me. After using it I found that you can find the planets no problem with it but they do not come in very sharp with any of the lenses. I could not make out any large features on Jupiter. I was able to find the Horsehead nebula in Orion with it but again, the level of detail left much to be desired.The manual controls on this are horrid and there is alot of play in moving the altitude and azimuth, making centering on objects kind of hard.If all you want to do is look at the moon, this isn't a bad telescope. Beyond that, spend a little more on a better scope."
2,Good to start but...,"Received as anniversary present from my wife two years ago. Purchased to be installed under counter. Unit worked well until installed. The materials available via retailer stated could be installed under counter with no clearance required. However, the left side unit no longer cools (actually temp inside is higher than ambient temp in room) when under the counter (have 1 1/2 in on top and 1/2 inch on each side). Finally, the manual (which poor me, I believed the seller reps) states minimums are 3 in on top and 2 in on each side. With these specs (3 in on top) it cannot be built in underneath a standard height counter (33 1/2 + 3 > 34 in standard cabinet height). Now I have a very expensive wine cabinet not wine cooler."
4,Wine Cellar,"Love this machine. Works great. Have had it for 6 years. Now it has a problem. The lights and fan work, and the temperature settings work. It behaves like either the freon is low (I don't hear the compressor starting), or whatever causes the compressor to start is crippled... Fuse looks good, nothing visibly burned on the motherboard, haven't opened the bottom."
1,Run away (the 1 star was an accident),"It's hard to say what's a bigger piece of junk, the Franklin Chef wine cooler, the company or the service contractors. Mine failed after 2 1/2 years. After 5 service calls from 2 different authorized service companies it was rendered unrepairable. It was out of warranty and the company said ""there's nothing more we can do"". They could have at least given me a replacement at cost. I had to eat it for almost $1200. My GE kitchen refrigerator has been working for 20 years and cost $600."
1,HOrRIBLE COMPANY,DON'T BUY anything from Franklin Chef!! I purchased a Beverage Cooler from Home Depoot. The product stopped working within 8 months. They had someone come out to fix it multiple times. Then they switched service companies. My beverage cooler has now been broke for almost a year and now they are telling me that it's past my one year warranty and they won't replace it!
3,a good counterpoint to the typical home buying books,"This booklet is unflinching in its depiction of unscrupulous real estate agents being out to get you. The author gives useful information about what tricks you should look out for during the inspection process and in how agent-approved inspectors may not be looking out for you as much as they could be. Self-serving information, no doubt, given the author is an independent inspector, but it is good to hear the story from all sides.After reading this booklet I knew what kind of inspections I needed to have done. I understood what the inspector would and would not do, and what the inspector could reasonably tell me and what they could not.The booklet struck me as overly paranoid with regard to the lack of integrity of real estate agents. But this booklet (yes booklet, it is stapled like a magazine, not bound) serves as a useful counterpoint to the home buying guides written by real estate agents, which usually paint a much rosier home-buying picture."
1,didn't last long,I purchased this mini dehudifier in Dec. of '05. It worked well for a few hours. Then the fan stopped working. I then returned it and was given a full refund.
1,I would rather not to give it any star if there were such a choice,"Very poor quality, and over-priced.I bought it on Jan 2006, only used it slightly for a few hours, but it stopped working on the very 31st day.It has a poorly designed adaptor almost as big as the dehumidifier itself; It is too small and too weak to be put in any room; with only one foot high, it makes huge noises when working.I am really disappointed with this product."
1,THE WORST,"I purchased one of these and it quit working after a month. Then I purchased another and that too quit working after a month. This has to be one of the worst products on the market. I'd give it zero stars if that were an option. I have never been so disappointed in an Amazon purchase in my life. If you are looking to purchase one of these, I encourage you not to."
1,The unit stinks,Always a problem with this unit. When I contacted Windchaser customer service I got the run around. Don't buy it unless you want to waste your money.
1,Not as pictured!,"I ordered these next day air thinking that they were JDM clear amber markers, they are actually Euro clear amber markers. Im not saying that Amazon is to blame here, but APC needs to be more clear on their box. The item description; on the box, says corner lense and shows a JDM clear lense...it does not show a Euro clear. Just to give a heads up to anyone who is considering ordering these. So if you are trying to go for that clean true JDM look, these are not it. Dont get me wrong this 1 star rating is not out towards Amazon by no means, Amazon gets 5 stars for all the other purchases I have made. Just out to the manufacturer of the product for not being more descriptive on the labeling of the product. So APC, you are a waist of my money and time!!! On the other hand Amazon, I will be shoping for a different set!"
3,Antipasto,"I found this first novel, by a creative writing program graduate, to be readable but thin. The motivation and inner life of the principal characters are hardly developed, though that may be the author's point: Ms. Azzopardi appears to be primarily interested in the ambiguity of the central characters' separate attraction to flight and, with minor exceptions, in the numb isolation of their daughters. If so, for me, it is a low-calorie premise.The author creates a pretty good sense of time and place dependent too much, for my taste, on food descriptions. Unfortunately, her style is neither especially realistic nor magical nor lyrical nor driven by psychology. It is just there, just craftsmanlike. Life down on the docks of Cardiff, with Maltese immigrants scratching out a living, turns out to be not much different from life in, say, Hoboken in the 1950s.In the category of atmospheric, family-descriptive first novels, I enjoyed The God of Small Things and The Joy Luck Club far more."
3,Hard to follow dialect,"This is a book better read in long sittings rather than a few pages before bedtime. I found some of the dialect hard to understand. At the ending of the book reveals more detail about the family troubles. I may go back and read it a second time to understand some details I may have missed out on. I feel that jumping from scene to scene was a bit hard to follow until probably half way through the book as I am not accustomed to this style of writing. Overall, worth reading. I have a hard time finding books that will hold my interest, this one did an average job."
2,alone in my opinion?,"i was very excited to read this book. the woman who wrote it graduated from the creative writing program at the school i am on exchange at. my hopes were dashed about 50 pages in. i kept waiting for the novel to go somewhere interesting but it never did. aside from the location i felt like i had read it all before... the crazy mother, screwed up dad, displaced, messed-up children... all novel worthy, but not if it isn't at least fresh or well done, and in my opinion, it wasn't. i found the narrative to be highly unsatisfying and scattered in it's presentation. and the ending? bad. bad. bad."
3,"not bad, not great",The Hiding Place was a good book but it could have been better. Sometimes I had to read certain sentences or paragraphs over b/c I wasn't sure what was going on.
5,Heavy duty leash,This leash is exactly what I was looking for. It has a heavy duty chain and is very well made. Thank you!
5,Great Leash for the Chewer!,"We have a hound mix puppy who is 6 months old. Hes about 35lbs (so far) and chews and chews and chews! We have gone through 4 nylon leashes so far, which is why we switched to metal link. The only way to make this leash better would be a padded nylon handle. That wasn't expected so I still gave it 5 stars.It doesn't get tangled, it isn't too heavy, and is well made.I looked at PetCo and PetSmart and the similar leashes there were $20+ there. This one is just like the ones they carry and almost half the price!Not sure what the other reviewers saw that caused them to rate anything but a 5. I would recommend this leash and will probably be getting another just for back-up."
1,watch this one when you need sleep.,This movie was one of the most depressing and slow moving movies I have ever seen in my whole life. I had loved the awesome songs that go along with the movie. But the movie I believe wasn't truely worthy of them. It's a good movie if you are starving for a false sense of knowing about the aquatic world. You get to know cool false information about dolphins and life on Antarctia. I would watch this movie late at night if I hadn't slept in weeks.
1,Nope I stand by my original review...,"Actually I was well aware this movie was for children, I used to watch it when I was a kid and I hated it then and I hate it now. Just wanted to clarify that I am not an adult and I am not easily bored. =)"
4,"Not just what you say, but how you say it!","This book is about how to speak when giving presentations, with a focus on business presentations.It describes how to say things, with an eye toward avoiding egregious speaking blunders and getting out of unpleasant situations. There is a chapter on how to write a presentation to be interesting and informative. Included is a section on visual presentations, and things to avoid while giving them.One appendix has a list of valuable speaking exercises targeting respiratory muscles. The other is a list of 44 speaking pointers that were developed throughout the books. You'd be wise to read it before every presentation.This book is full of simple ways to greatly improve one's speaking skills. I recommend it along with Winning! by Noelle Nelson."
4,modern masterpiece-with DVD /book format alerts,"This is a tiny book on a great master work. I had never heard of this amazing complex, and was intriged by the book description. I can happily report that the design is indeed masterful, but there are some important things to mention about the format of the product. The publishers have been somewhat overly-insistent (IMO) on the idea that the complex should be understood in motion, and so have provided a very high-quality DVD in tandem with the book. They have even registered the timing of the DVD with the pages of the book, in the somewhat amusing expectation that someone should be attentively paging through the book along with the DVD. Of course a high quality DVD is great, but I sincerely wish the publishers had had the good sense to make the Book A BOOK, a larger format book, one that would do justice to Schader's great architecture, and still provide the DVD. A higher price and so on, but please a LARGER format!! The book is DVD size!!"
1,Awful,This is worse than something from the dollar store. Poor poor quality It is so bad and flimsy it doesnt even come close to removing stem. Save your money
4,street fighter's another story!,"This is quite short, I enjoyed watching this vol. for it has AWESOME fighting scenes, but the stories are different. imagine Dhalsim thought Ryu the HADO KEN, Chun li's boyfriend was Ken, Eliza never exist, and Fei-long Chun-li's brother and lots of othe stuff that what makes it not so popular."
1,Expedition Alaska,"This is a perfect video for the stay-at-home eco-tourist who want to substantiate their preconceived notions about climate change without ever examining or understanding the science. Full of one narrcistic t.v. personality and several made-for-tv, mantra-chanting professors out on a well-funded jaunt through parts of Alaska using internal cumbustion enegines that add to the global warming issue to which this video addresses. Add to that one silly ultra-light and its noise pollution. There is an air of 'science' to the narrative, but, for those who listen carefully, there is no substance, just innuendo and conjecture. Poorly edited, poorly scripted, poorly cast."
1,Not what I thought,"I went to Alaska in 2009,ever since I came home..I've been looking for exciting dvds or blu rays on Alaska.the Sights,the Sounds,the Beauty of Alaska..this blu ray fell short of expectations"
1,Glorified hippy boy band,"I can't figure out the appeal of this bad band, especially to so-called Deadheads. It doesn't make sense that people who had the good taste to like the Dead also like this band, unless they didn't really appreciate the musical genius of Jerry Garcia but just liked the druggy ""culture"" of the Deadhead scene.Of the 600 plus CD's in my ""CD jukebox"", the CD's of this band are the only ones I have EVER thrown out.Seeing them on SNL I was trying to figure out the appeal and it seemed like maybe their popularity is just amongst tasteless groupy's like a boy band's audience.I don't get it."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"First off, I am not a Phish fan, but I bought this CD and ended up liking it. It is mellow, and flows well. It starts off with the rocking Free, which is an absolute great song. It is followed by Character Zero, which many people say is Phish's best song. Personally, I like it but feel it is overrated. There isn't much to say about Waste or Taste, Waste is pretty good, taste is okay. Cars Trucks and Buses is an instrumental, and I personally don't like it. Talk is a good song, and Theme from the bottom is a great song, though a little long. Train song and bliss are short throwaways, but the title track is a great song often overshadowed. The next two are also fillers, and Prince Caspian is just an awesome song, my favorite Phish song. This was a brief, and probably useless review, but I'd reccommend this CD over any of Phish's other studio albums."
5,Pure Bliss,"Phish has really done it this time. This album is truly a masterpiece for those of you who really KNOW Phish. Phish spent countless hours recording this album at Bearsville Studios. They jammed to the point of exhaustion, and kept the reels that best suited their preference at the time. ""Billy""..inspired by Trey's newest born...truly encompasses a vibe that can be felt by even the most virgin of Phans. This album leaves the listener with nothing less than a feeling of Bliss. Anything more is up to your imagination! Please enjoy this album as you set yourself ""Free"". Some phood phor thought...If you were to dress up as ""Free"" at the next Halloween show..how would you do it?"
4,Continue a tradition,"Even though the band is best when seen in concert with their improvisations and what not, Phish discs are meant to let you hear what the song really is, in a cleaned up, ""RAW"" version. You won't get the same thing as a show but you can get to apprecaite the song from its beginning!!!"
5,OHH MYYY GODD!,"Who says this is a mellow CD! I bumped then listened to this, man I thought I was going to pop a blood vessel in my brain! I jumped around and played air guitar for 60 straight minutes! I lost my voise from yelling! Defenaitely ""For tweakers only""! My Favorite since metallica and guns and roses! Metal rock is BAACKK BAABBY! 5 STARS!"
3,"Its a good CD, but it sure isnt great","Although some of the songs on billy breathes, for example, prince caspian, have some good aspects to them, others do not. It almost made me think that phish had sold out to try and get some of thier songs on the radio, which I dont think is really important when it comes down to the type of phans that they have."
2,Phish not creative at all here,"Billy Breates is one of those albums that make's me say to myself, ""I payed how much for this?"" Basically Phish took all of their great live tunes, and sucked everything out of them that made them great songs. (ex. Free, Character 0, Taste, Theme from the Bottom, Billy Braethes, Prince Caspian) These songs were never meant to be under 6 minutes. Pobably the people who gave this album 5 stars are the one's who haven't seen Phish play live, because this album shows no sign of creativity."
4,billy bomb,this is a sweet cd. i listen to it everyday--especially when i am hanging out at a low key party
4,Phantastic phor the phirst time phisher!,"BILLY BREATHES is a good album. It's not at the top of my phavorites list, but for someone who is new to Phish and needs a taste of them - this, again, is a good album. It's pretty mello and less experimental and innovative (but not lacking character by any means!), making it a great listen for someone who hasn't committed to the label of ""Phish Head."" BILLY BREATHES has some great ballads; ""Waste"" is a beautiful song, and there are definitely a few others making BB worth the buy. All in all, I'm definitely glad to have it as part of my Phish collection!"
5,Don't know where to start with Phish? Right here...,"Here's the slow and skinny. Phish have a large collection of studio albums, and to the new listeners, they may pick up an album like ""Junta"", full of crazy lyrics, and long orchestrated pieces, and decide ""Hey, this is too weird for me."" That's too bad, because if you pick up ""Billy Breathes"" first, you'll be hooked. This CD is the ultimate introduction to Phish. Great songs like Free, Character Zero, and Taste provide a solid backbone for this album, which is expanded with songs such as the fan favourite Waste, and the Page McConnell (the piano player) showcase, Cars, Trucks, Buses. While not overall Phish's best album, this album is the best introduction for a new fan."
4,Heavily Under Rated,"Many hardcore phish-heads will tell you that the studio albums suck, just go straight for the live shows. this is true to an extent, that extent is that the live shows are just unbeleivably unbeliavable that it makes the studio, awesome, chilled out albums look bad. This is a great album with no really bad songs. I would say buy this and any live album together, listen to BB first then pop in the live one."
4,"good CD, not Phish's best","Phish is one of my favorite bands, and this is a good CD. It's different from the usual progressive jazz kind of jams Phish plays. For Phish beginners, this is the CD to start with. For phans, it's a good CD, more mellow than some of their other stuff. I think Phish is a live band, and at their best in concert or live, but for a studio album Phish does a decent job. This CD is worth 15 bucks."
3,mad_squirrell's social commentary,"""billy breathes"". perhaps ""billy weezes"" would have been more appropriate. the ""pop"" appeal of the recording does not detract from its musical value. this is perhaps the only phish recording that lacks a sense of continuity between tracks. the individual melodies of ""cars trucks buses"", ""waste"", ""free"" and ""character 0"" are perhaps superior to songs on other more highly accliamed albums. yet the break between songs, the shift from one to the next, leaves the listener tonicly confused and less satisfied. do not misunderstand this review. ""billy breathes"" is excellent. unfortunatley when measured against other recordings by phish, it is not one of their best. if ""billy breathes"" was an unknown band from oxford ohio, it would be an undeniable 5 star break through."
2,A dud that critics love,"There are a couple of bright moments on this disc, but one warning sign is that critics LOVE this disc. It is very flat overall, none of the dynamic, over the top imaginative hooks that we've come to love and expect from Phish. Billy Breathes has repetitive, boring melodies that anybody with a guitar and a dime could come up with. Gone are the epics. Gone is the humor. If you feel that you don't dig older Phish (Junta, Lawn Boy, Picture of Nectar), then try starting with The Story of the Ghost, there is a lot more substance to it. Billy Breathes is not really breathing at all."
1,Just not a Sony,I purchased the JVC for it's advanced features and size. Little did I know how poor the video quality would be. In poor lighting the images are at times unrecognizable. The digital still camera is a joke. The microphone records everything but what you are aiming at. It is a pain to connect it to your TV or to your computer. I'm still trying to fine tune it but I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing it. The camera is not a good purchase for the money.
2,Agree- it has problems,"And I thought all these problems were related to my mother dropping the camera down the stairs.Those that have this camera- be patient with ""cleaning tape"" errors. Cycle the power a few times. Take the battery on and off. It will usually work eventually.Having half the screen blue has only happened when I used the aftermarket Hi-output battery. It works fine for pictures, but will usually screw up video.For indoor video, I usually use the SLOW 2 video speed. Brighter video, but slower fps.Slow picture downloads are due to the Serial port, Video download with firewire is no problem."
4,Great features at a great price.,"I've had the 50U for 3 years and it has never disappointed me. It is compact, rugged and handsome. The quality of the movies is excellent (mini DVs), and the quality of the still pictures is very good (though not as good as any of the 3+ megapixel cameras available). The built in image stabilization feature is great and absolutely necessary at extended zoom ranges (camera shake increases dramatically as you zoom). The drawbacks, as I see them, are the expense of the media (the mini DVs for film and the MultiMediaCards for stills are about the most expensive choices around), the complexity of the JVC software/editing pkg and the rather poor JVC service reputation. Nonetheless, the 90U, with its image stabilization makes this camera an all-around winner, and at this price too good a deal to pass up."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this camera two years ago. I used it on a very limited basis--basically a few birthdays and a vacations. When my wife recently gave birth to twins, i brought it to the hospital to take some video. Well, as you can expect, the camera did not work. I took it to the repair shop and they indicated it would cost $625 to fix it. Find another camcorder--this one has too many problems"
2,"ok camera, crappy video interface with computers","I bought this camera unaware I would have so much trouble finding the right equipment to capture video, I have a compaq notebook, and I can't seem to find the right stuff to hook the camera up to my computer, nor the software. I'm totally frustrated with this camera , and have had a few mechanical problems with it also, I would not recommend this camera to someone looking for a easy camera to run."
3,"Nice, but Beware!","I just purchased this camera and love all but one of the features that I was most interested in. JVC advertises that you can capture a short video clips to email friends and relatives. Well, this is true, but what they do not tell you is that the format is in JMM format, which is some kind of JVC proprietary format! I have yet to find anyone who supports or has a converter for this format. JVC has partnered with a web service that allows you to store these images for people to come view. This is a free service until you what more space. I just think this is another gimmick to make money at the expense of the consumer.You will also find out when you play back these clips with the supplied viewer that the quality is very poor!Another issue I had was that the menus and buttons associated with the memory card were not very intuitive or easy to follow.Overall, I would recommend this camera with the exception of ... the Email Clip feature."
3,Not Happy w/ video output,"The color GREEN is not reproduced well when playing back a video. Green is everywhere (it's in the grass, birds feathers, the leaf of a tree or bush..., everywhere)! Why does the Green look grayish when playing the video!? No, it's not a lighting issue that I'm confronted with. I live in So. Cal and there's lots of Sunshine. Also, this camera does not record well at all, nor take decent pictures when lighting is only slightly hindered. And the email video format is horrible! By the time I discovered all the features, how to use them, and how horrible some of them were it was too late to even try to return it. I am not happy. After learning more about the type of product I actually desired, I've discovered that the Sony DCR-PC110 is the camcorder I should have purchased (although I don't like that Memory Stick). I basically learned a...Dollar Lesson..."
2,I am not a happy camper,I discovered pretty soon after I bought it that this was not the camcorder for me. The only time the image quality (both still and video) is acceptable is outdoors in bright daylight. I have had much problems downloading still images to computer. I was working on a windows NT station and on a win95. I got it to work once but was never able to repeat it. I am a computer professional. It could be I have a defective cable but frankly I do not have so much time to deal with tech support and repairs and replacement. When I buy a product like this I just want it to work out of the box. Other issues are that it comes with no lens cap and that the battery that it comes with has a very short life (less than a hour). In retrospect the SOny P110 (which is almost double the price) is worth it.
1,poor software update.,"JVC is not keeping up with the software. I have updated my computer to windows 2000, and am unable to use my computer to download the pictures. I have even written to Japan and find JVC does not bother to answer. I went to the store to find out if the most up to date camera is able to be used on windows 2000,the salesman was very helpful, he had not been aware of the problem and offered to give me a copy of the software if it was compatible with 2000 but, no luck, the software goes only as far as 98. Apparently the driver is different. JVC Canada could only tell me to go back to windows 98. That is not good enough. I have been a JVC customer for over 25 years, I have the TV, and VHS from them and this is my third camera from them, but this is the last thing I will ever buy from JVC. What they call customer service, just does not measure up. By the way I love the camera. If it was not for the problem with the support, I would give the camera a rating of 5 stars."
3,Two drawbacks...,"1-If you're planning to use this camcorder in dark places forget it. Even in low light situations, this camcorder won't see a thing.2-Battery is short, probably 25 minutes with the LCD screen and about 45 min using the color viewfinder. You'll need to buy an extra battery.Other than that this is a nice camcorder."
4,"excellent price value,main disappointment:batt. time","the dvm 90 is a very good camcorder:i liked its ease of use and the combo of video and sensible stills;it is short on battery time and i needed to buy an extra batt. which gives me 2 more hours...,but no 6-8 hours batteries like you can find in other models.the other shortcoming is dark photography,which is practicalyy impossible.nevertheless,it is perfect for home use,both indoors and outdoors,and it is not a bad substitute for a still camera,that is if you are not keen on having big printed albums but settle for digital ones.2 sum it up:full hearted recommendation."
3,Only for close ups and bright light,This camcorder although small and easy to carry works poorly in room light. The digital camera (XGA) photographs are good in close ups where detail is less critical. The resolution is insufficient to make distant (small) objects/detail clear and is quickly spotted in all photographs.The transfer rate from camcorder to PC of photographs took me over 45 mins for 32 mg of XGA. There are other devices available however to bypass this step. I returned the camcorder.
1,I Agree with Sue and Alison - Bad customer service & bad cam,"I also agree with Sue and Alison. My camera also experienced the HEAD CLEANING REQUIRED message and you can NEVER NEVER NEVER rely on getting the video captured and played back successfully. If you had a new baby and want to save all the ""moments"" DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. I took in for service too and they supposedly adjusted the head, however, I again started getting the messages and my videos come have green and the other half as normal. I truly think that there is something more wrong with this camera. Just as Alison mentioned, I get the E04 Error, you think the battery is fully charged, however, I get this one and I have no idea what to do. In addition, when I contacted the JVC Customer service, they were not too helpful either. SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHES and buy ANOTHER camera. I am tempted to do that also, but for the $$."
5,The sounds of radio astronomy?,"No, S.E.T.I. is Andrew Lagowski. Along with numerous solo works,he has worked with Legion and was the sound engineer on Lustmords""Heresy"" cd. Sounds here range from drones and pulses of digitalcompression type sounds to electronic scratches and squarbles.THIS IS FOR FANS OF NOISE ONLY-NO MUSIC18 very alien tracks in all. With track names such as ""Mars roverx155440 and Crab nebula 1"" you will imagine faraway alien trans-missions from outer space. Reminds me of being a kid transfixed by shortwave radio.Compelling stuff."
4,A Little Tip - Save Money Using This Product,The little packets you buy to mix in this device contain nothing more than sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. The first is table salt and the second is baking soda.I have been making my own mixtures for pennies now.
3,NeilMed Sinus Rinse PreMix,"I have used these in the past and find them convenient. However, I wonder if regular non iodized salt doesn't work just as well."
4,Very adorable book for the pug lover!,"I just got this book and I couldn't wait to read it. It is a very cute book. The first picture in the book of the pug sitting is exactly like my pug that I own. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was that I thought it was a specific story about a pug. However, it turned out that it was a book, yes about pugs, but each page spread had a different nursery rhyme with the words changed to pertain to the pug. It wasn't what I expected but it was still absolutely adorable! I would recommend it for any dog lover!"
4,Chez Chance is a very wise and funny novel,"Jay Gummerman proved himself as a short story writer with his soulful first book, WE FIND OURSELVES IN MOONTOWN. His first novel, CHEZ CHANCE, shows that Gummerman's wit and vision carry over nicely in longer narratives. Themes of physical and emotional disability wrap around each other to great effect, as the wheelchair-bound hero of the novel approaches a new understanding of himself and his place in a world dominated by ""enabled"" Americans and their hunger for material distractions such as Mercedes Benzes and Disneyland. This book will make you think and make you laugh, no matter where you're from; if you have an interest in the culture of Southern California, it's a must-read."
4,pretty good grinder especially for the price,"this is a great little grinder for the price. it was a little slow at first to catch the pollen, however currently it is collecting like a champ. that action is very smooth, however, the main compartment does not like to easily close. i guess the threads are too small. it does close just fine, just never on the first try. it built up a lot of resin quickly which made the rotating grinding part not as good, but just scrape it with a small tool every month or so depending on how much you use it. for the price i am very happy with my purchase, much cheaper than a space case, however i cannot attest to its longevity as i have only had mine for about a month. a solid deal!!"
3,"Lovely, but heavy!",This towel set is beautiful. Only problem is that it falls off the towel rack when decoratively folded because the ribbon trim is very heavy.
1,Bad Connection,The sender didn't warn how used this item was. It was so severely scratched that it only played the first 3 songs and it would cost me more to return it than I payed. This is an Album that I can't find in stores and will need to purchase it new.
4,A present for mother in law,"I ordered this for my mother in law, and she absolutely loves it! Says it has lots of herbal remedies that she can use. If she likes it, I like it."
1,Made for wannabees,since I know Mr Garrett and his motivation for writing these booksand have for over 16 years....I just had to buy it and see if he was still up to his old tricks. This made for what we call Twinkies and NDN Wannabees.You can buy any number of books on plants and their medicinal uses and do it without supporting someone who has associated with a known cultural thief Diane Fisher a.k.a. Dyhani Ywahoo for years and presented himself as an elder at her gatherings in Vermont. His father was respected among our people. This is yet another shameless attempt to just make money.
3,"Extensive compilation of herbs, but of no practical use",Garret has compiled an extensive list of herbs with their common and botanical names. There is no explanation of how these herbs were combined for various cures and therefore provides no understanding of the healing practices.
1,Unhelpful,"At every turn Mr. Garrett pleads his inability to share the complete lore of the uses of the herbs because of their ""sacred significance."" He ends up with less Native American cultural/religious information than can be gleaned from any of Tony Hillerman's mystery series, plus a listing of plants which grow in the Appalachians and hints of the conditions in which they might be helpful. Note that these hints do not include the formulae for making them useful with other herbs. A complete waste of time and money."
4,A good serial killer thriller,"I enjoyed this book. Although it is one of many in this genre, it had interesting characters and a reasonable plot. I found the concept of the ""tower"" part of the prison a bit far-fetched but otherwise it was an exciting read."
1,One of the Trashiest Books I Have Read in Years,"I love gory books. I love Thomas Harris. But this crappy book has the widest collection of unmitigated and unnecessary gore that I have read. Gore without purpose, gratuitous blood, all placed unrelenting in a novel to hide the fact that the author cannot write - at all. When I read Harris' Lecter, I wanted to get into the mind of the killer. If I am intrigued at all by this book, it is with the very sick or incompetent mind of the author. The only reason I gave it a 1 star is because the rating goes no lower."
2,Too bad Ivy,"I enjoyed this book the way that I enjoy a Columbo movie. The sad thing is that Im not sure that was the authors intention. The book is just hilarious because of the authors infantile perception of crime and punishment. This is the last time that I buy thriller from an ivy league author. If your going to write about being down there, youre going to have to go down there. The author does have excellent writing skills, the story flows and reads well, he just needs to throw himself in the streets for a few years and then who knows, maybe he'll rival the best. No, no nonononon... not possible, sorry ivy."
5,HOPE IT'S MADE FOR THE SILVER SCREEN!!!,"Here's one for Hollywood. The Tower portrays two people haunted by similar backgrounds who have wound up on opposite sides of the spectrum. Jade Marlow, the FBI detective delves dangerously deep into the mind of serial killer Allander Atlasia, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.Although gory at times, The Tower realistically portrays a man who commits the most horrific crimes a sane person could not even fathom.I have always been extremely fascinated by serial killers and have read a number of books about them. Hurwitz has clearly done his psychological homework.Just as a footnote, it would be wonderful if a facility such as The Tower were created. I would feel a lot safer at night."
2,"Nitpicking, but valid observation.","Hurwitz's other books, especially ""The Program,""deliver far better reads than this fairly predictible novel. In my opinion, those who presume to write about crime and guns have an obligation to learn enough about these subjects not to deliver such laughable lines as: ""It was a bolt gun, holding four rounds in the mag but only one in the chamber."" (As if there are any guns of any type whatsoever that hold more than one round at a time in the chamber.)"
2,No 'Silence of the Lambs' Here,"The reviewer on the cover [James Thayer] suggests a favorable comparison to the Hannibal Lecter stories of Thomas Harris. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this novel to sustain such a comparison. The villain, Allander Atlasia, is on the contrary, a boring, sterotypical killer like those in many, many books of this genre. He has none of the panache of Hannibal Lecter. More troubling though, is the protagonist, Jade Marlow. The surname is evocative of 'Hearts of Darkness' and suggests a deeply troubled, complex, dark type of hero. Well this Marlow is definetly troubled, he fails to involve the reader as he behaves like a jerk througout the entire novel. There is nothing redeeming about his unemotive, robot-like behavior. The plot involves Marlow chasing after Atlasia upon his escape from prison. The end of the novel is both predictable and unfulfilling. There are much better examples of this genre and this is a book best avoided."
2,This definitely is NOT comperable to Silence of the Lambs,"I can't believe that I read the same book as the other reviewers. Gregg A. Hurwitz is definitely not Thomas Harris. The book starts out promising and slowly degenerates into a parody of what a good serial killer/suspense book should be. Allandar Atlasia is initially an interesting villain but he is never totally fleshed out. Jade Marlow's the famed tracker gets boring fast once his character gets involved with agent Travers. The chemistry between the two is almost non-existent. The best characters are Atlasia's parents, and it is with them I felt the most empathy. There were too many one-dimensional characters in this book that are never fleshed out, and the story behind the story of Atlasia's twisted behaviour is never fully revealed. I felt this book was a waste of time."
1,Beware,"Despite the image shown and the lack of any written description, the item is actually a single fuse. It came tucked in a plastic baggie in a thinly padded envelope that looked like it had been run over by a truck. I contacted the company and received the following reply:""It is indeed only one fuse , By the way the manuf. has the same image .However we will correct this asap.We apologize for any errors & inconveniences & thank you for your patronageSincerely ,Adorama Customer Service Dept.""Of course, I didn't BUY this item from the manufacturer's web site nor do I care what is on ANOTHER web site. I ended up paying $12.95 for a single fuse. It took them more than a month to get it to me. It was sent UPS for which I was sharged $7.95 for a envelope that weighed less than an ounce. I haven't tried the fuse yet but I'm not certain of its condition considering how it was shipped."
4,Enjoyable!,"Esperanza is a wonderfully strong character. I loved her willingness to do almost anything to find her daughter. She had a lot of faith, which definately helped her throughout her journey for the truth."
5,"Profound, endearing, tightly written, two thumbs way up!","Esperanza's Box of Saints is a beautifully written tale of the process of faith, and one woman's unshakable belief system. Esperanza's spiritual 'worldliness' is juxtapostioned with her lack of social 'worldliness' which keeps the reader rooting for her until the very end. I can't think of a book that I have enjoyed more over the past few years, and I read a lot! Whether you are looking for an entertaining read or looking for answers to the nature of faith, Esperanza's Box of Saints is a 5 star book"
5,heartwarming! wonderful!,"I absolutely loved this book. I loved the characters - all of them were briliantly developed. I want to meet Esperanza and Angel! If you want a light, fun book, read this. It's a cross between Practical Magic (Alice Hoffman) and Where The Heart Is (Billie Letts)."
4,the book,Esperansa Box of Saints is the best realistic book.Because of all she went throw to find her daughter and thinking she was alive and she did every thing just to find her.Their was so many things that she belive in she was so religios.I really enjoy this book.
3,Marketing Madness,"I felt like this novel was written as an experiment, not because she loves to write. From the Spanish edition to the screenplay to the reader's guide, it all seems too perfect. I also wondered if she even changed her last name for the novel so that it would be on the bookshelves next to ""Like Water for Chocolate."" Even as a marketing gag I'm impressed that it's received so much hype. Novel-by-numbers!"
2,A good idea but poorly written,"I liked most the plot of the book and the events and incidents. But I found it difficult liking the way it was written. Also, after awhile I realized that the author was filling every steretype, Esperenza, beautiful , sort of clumsy, but cute, strong ....... and then the people she met were so cliched. Quite dissapointing actually."
4,Brush up on your knowledge of the Mexican Saints!,"A mother sacrifices her life and dignity to find her 12 year old daughter with the help of St. Judas Tadeo. Funny, yet tragic... I liked the story, but my only complaint is the ending. It does not do justice to the rest of the book. Read it, you'll know what I mean"
2,a bit forced,"The plot was good, at times sparingly humourous. Yet for some reason I felt as though the author wasn't flowing with writing, it was almost passionless and without the flair which establishes a good, all time favorite author. I don't think this book deserved all the praise which was showered on it. It was a book trying too hard."
1,boo,"i wish i could get my money back for this one.most of the time i would say that the book is better then the movie but this time it is the complete opposite, if you are going to waste your time with this book see the movie first then read the book, the movie is better then the book and makes sense. the book makes no sense."
1,Disillusioned,"I heard a reading from the author herself, and became quite interested in purchasing the book. It is a good attempt, but too forced. I get the feeling that the author tries to hard to make it funny, which smacks of stupid. I think, if anything, I would recommend it to young teenagers."
2,Reads Like A Mexican Novela,"I should know, I watch so many of them on Spanish television! The difference is this book doesn't have complex characters--and believe me when I say that in novelas the plot depends on plenty of shallow ones to make things happen. Not once do we know what's going on in Esperanza's head--doesn't she think? reflect? second guess herself? Heroines in novelas always do, which is why they are fascinating and three dimensional. I felt this book was written to please an American audience, but American audiences won't understand the Mexican humor, Maria!!! Oh, well, maybe the movie will be better. Though if Esperanza thinks in the movie I'm going to credit the director John Sayles!"
1,Hardly entertaining!!!!,"The symbolism and magic realism in this book are entirely forced and fake. Magic realism is usualluy so well integrated into writing that it surpasses reality. Here, the author has failed to elegantly employ both symbolism and magic realism, almsot like pretending to be a good writer. I would not recommend this book even to the very very bored."
3,More plot please,It was an interesting premise. It just didn't hold my attention very well. I would have liked a bit more romance to it. The characters needed more fleshing out as well. It was just kind of flat. The sex was very steamy and interesting. I just wanted to get to know the characters better.
2,Where's the story?,"If you like a little story with your sex scenes, this is the book for you. If you want more of a story line, pick another book."
1,Desperate Sales Attempt,"This book was a complete let down, the title of the book is completly misleading. A short story is just that a short story, but most of the stories in this book are more like book previews. It seems the purpose of this collection was to increase books sales for the various writers rather that provide interesting short stories. This was a complete waste of time, don't waste your money."
3,it was just okay,"I anticipated reading The Game because of reading previous books by Shannon Holmes, Nikki Turner and Vickie Stringer and really enjoyed their work. But I found this book disappointing. Some stories were good while others were just okay. Some of the stories were too short and predictable. I would still recommend reading the book for the stories by the aboved mentioned authors as well as Tracy Brown, K'wan, Joylynn Jossel, Freeze, and Thomas Long."
1,NEVER AGAIN,SURPRISE THAT MR HOLMES WOULD BACK THIS BOOK I HATE SHORT STORIES IT DESIRE U TO WANT MORE IT LEAVES U HANGING !
2,Just OK,"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars because there were some ok story stories in this book. I am wishing that there was less authors in this book way to many and some was to short to even get the full view of the story until it was over.But, It has opened me up to finding other authors that I never read. Overall OK."
5,Excellent Material,"One of the best books on the origin of the orthodox view of Christianity, by comparing it to this one gnostic sect. Primarily good at pointing out the differences between the concept of Jesus as God, and Jesus, the one who shows us how to be like him -an enlightened being with knowldege of who we and God are.Very excellent background on the politics of having the Levites and their priesthood be the ones who decided what would be orthodox teachings and the exclusion of the Ashoreth cult.I liked the book. :)JoAnna Cham"
2,Gnostic Secretsnof the Naassenes,I found that the book lacked an organized approach to the subject and I finally quit reading it even though the subject itself is very close to my heart and I was quite anxious to learn more about it.
2,2nd title it takes a village.,"I only read parts of it takes a village by Hillary Clinton, and as a concervative I sorta said yeah okay, she is not crazy, she has that Liberal Idea that we are all responsible for each other... Fine. I read It takes a Family and it felt I was reading the same book save for the attacks on Hillary. Write a book that has something to say, instead of agreeing with a political enemy and assassinating her character in the same breath."
1,It Takes a Family,"Couldn't finish the book, so self serving. I am a conservative but had to set it aside and recycle it to Goodwill."
1,Big Government Conservatism,"This book is crammed with an array of ideas for technocratic meddling; even the author acknowledges that some people ""will reject"" what he has to say ""as a kind of 'Big Government' conservatism."" If you believe in a small government and a strict reading of the constitution, Santorum's ideas are not for you."
1,I looked and I looked,"I was really excited to read Senator Santorum's book. I knew he was going to explain how I didn't need to work, we could raise our family with only one income - and I found where he said that.But I thought he would give concrete, how-to examples, like how he bought a house in a low income district that he never lived in with his family so his kids could get an education in a great school district and he could avoid paying property taxes. That a budget tip I could use!My husband and I would also like to avoid paying taxes we owe but we can't aford two houses to do it.So, I was disappointed."
1,Dribble,"Being a professor of Philosophy I was amazed about how little evidence was put into any of the claims made in the book. With such bold statements; Santorum speaks as if his words are fact. He seemingly denies all intellectual thought of any sort in this book, hitting every intellectual fallacy of argument while accomplishing nothing but making me feel bad for anyone who thinks this is a wonderful piece of literature. On Page 18 he states, ""Over 90 percent of the Elite news media voted for Kerry in 2004."" Now that sentence had no backing from any polling center, there was no evidence, no footnote, nothing. Just numbers that he felt appropriate to use. If you are looking to show a class how to compose a terrible philosophical paper, please recommend this book."
1,The religious counter-attack against the Enlightenment,"American Theocracy may be a better book to examine to understand the rise of right wing extremism in the fundamentalist community.Rick Santorum is opposed to contraceptives AND to abortions, but also want to cut funding for children in poverty, housing assistance, medical care, etc.And let's not forget that ""BLA"" people are welfare dependents.Santorum has his finger on the pulse of America -- in the 1800's.A sad day for America when someone so stupid can be considered a leader."
2,The byproduct of our times,"Santorum has obviously had his fill--his tone here is often downright lubegobrious. In this book, he turns his attention and his frothy prose to a mixture of matters, focusing especially on the stuff that makes families."
1,Christian Fundamentalism is Typically Quite Entertaining,"Christian fundamentalism is typically quite entertaining, but Rick Santorum's book just doesn't quite supply the laughs I expected. Normally, when I see fascist Santorum on the television, I am laughing hard. The guy is funny!!Unfortunately though, this book is just a dud. No laughs. I think Santorum went with the ""serious angle"" here. Big mistake! He should stick to the laugh-a-minute shtick that he exhibits everyday in the U.S. Senate.Amen!"
5,Our Next President,"I highly recommend reading this book written by our next president. You should also read Hillary Clinton's book to contrast her viewpoint that the more government involvemen we havet, the better off we are. You should also read at least one of Obama's books, the see what an angry man he really is, as he rants against American values, and blames his non-existent father for his hate!"
3,Very Conservative,He is very pro family and giving people a hand up not a hand out. I wish it had more info about him as a person instead of it being all political issues.
1,I would give it zero if I could,"Sick of the right wing rhetoric? Tired of the same old zealotry and idoltry in the name of religion? Better read this sad story of America's future. We are headed in the wrong direction. Corrupt politicians need to stop using the Lord's name to further their own power struggles. If Santorum cared as much about family as he does about money and power, he would be an individual worthy of reverence. This is not so."
1,Another Self-Serving Conservative Screed,"Studies show that strong families make our society stronger? Alert the media! Santorum's ode to the obvious is seriously and thoroughly undercut by his refusal to admit that the word ""family"" can be defined as anything other than a man, a woman, and their children. The book is purposely and unnecessarily divisive, which confirms Santorum's Neo-Con ideology, and insulting to millions of people who live in other than traditional circumstances. What's more, his self-serving, small-minded insinuations that Conservatives value families more than do Liberals or Progressives underline the true purpose of this political hackery. It Takes A Moron to think this is anything more than a stump speech."
2,coulda used more cow bell,"I really tried to like this book, but Mr. Santorum's efforts fell far short of the fiery, self-righteous rhetoric that I have come to expect in a social satire. While he included the requisite ramblings about ""libruls an' commies"", completely missing were the mouth-breathing rants about bestiality and ""durn Frenchies"" that first drew me to Rick's comedic wit. He did have me smirking with his views on education and ""intelligent design"", but I could tell his heart really wasn't in it. Not his best work; he's much more funny on C-SPAN."
1,Can't take seriously,"It is one thing to be fiscally conservative, but religion and conservatism do not go together well. Santorum is one of the many examples of that. There is a reason why church and state are supposed to be separate, and people like Santorum don't care about that. Santorum believes that the ideal family consists of one mom and dad. And of course, that family has to fit in HIS narrowly-defined idea of what constitutes a family.It is true that a family with two parents is often more stable emotionally and financially, but some families with a mom and dad are pretty screwed up, and some single-parent or same-sex couple families are AWESOME. Santorum says a lot of weird things, and it's sad that many agree with him on his closed-minded ways. I would take conservatives like Mr. Frothy seriously if they left religion out of politics."
1,Disgusting,"In this book Senator Santorum simply pushes the growing view that liberals are evil and that conservatives are godly. It is a disgusting use of emotional phrases in an attempt to prove how the poor conservatives who control all branches of the government are proscuted by the evil liberals, particulauly in the media. Do yourself a favor and DON'T read this book of lies."
1,Santorum excludes many or most Americans,"It is interesting to read views not my own, and dialogue is central to the way our democracy works. However, this book is insensitive to the variety of cultural and family experiences in our country, and this book advocates actions and recommendations that trample on basic, fundamental, Constitutional rights.It is ironic that the far-right view in current politics in the U.S.A., while broadly using the words ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" as touchstones, seek to rein in freedoms in a wide swath of areas of personal, community, and even global life. We are supposed to follow a particular dogma, and call it freedom. This destroys the foundations of our Constitution, and the foundations on which our founding political philosophers created our currently-challenged Nation. Thanks but no thanks, Mr. Santorum. -[...]"
1,snore,"I was eager to read Santorum's book after seeing him on so many talk shows. But the book was truly awful and filled with flawed reasoning and thoughtless bias. It was the worst book I read in the past several years, and I'm an avid reader. Save your money and your time. Read something else!"
4,BRAVE VENTURE,"INTERESTING STORY ABOUT A LITTLE KNOWN, BUT IMPORTANT PIECE OF HISTORY. JAMESTOWN WAS NOT ALONE. IT WAS ONE OF TWO COLONIES SETTLED AT THE SAME TIME IN AMERICA. THE OTHER WAS THE POPHAM COLONY IN MAINE, THEN KNOWN AS NORTHERN VIRGINIA."
5,Rise and Fall of Adlof Hitler 3 disc set,"As a high school World History teacher for 13 years, I can say this is a great learning tool for students concerning World War II. This is such a great set that I loaned it out and never got it back:( That's why I bought this used set. Great for showing how Hitler was able to ""Seduce"" the Germans and even other European leaders through the process of appeasement. The best part is when during Hitler's speeches they translate them with English subtitles."
5,"Lucky Chuck, lucky me!","I have been reading Beverly Cleary books my entire life and using them in my third grade classroom for more than twenty years, but I didn't discover Chuck until 2010. This book changed my life and I love it! After reading Lucky Chuck, I told my students that I believe it is always good to learn new things and I thought I would like to study the motor vehicle code and learn to ride a motorcycle. They looked at me with my gray hair and laughed, but I showed them! I always ride safely, but I love Lucky Chuck and thank him and Beverly Cleary for the inspiration to learn something new. My third graders love the story as well and they are always excited to see my motorcycle!"
4,Nice Practical Book,"I purchased this particular book for an on-line program and not because it even vaguely seemed attractive much less ""Effective"". To my delight the book has made some excellent strong points and is very practical. I really can't say too much ""cons"" about the book. If you need a book for a Management program, whether online or conventional class room or even for short courses and seminars...it works great. Easy, simple reading.I gave it 4 stars because it took 4 weeks to arrive-lost one star for shipping!"
5,Billy Price Danger Zone,Not living in Pittsburgh anymore it's hard to find CD's of local talent - Billy Price was one of my favorites back in da burgh - this CD is good old foot stomping blues with a black and gold flavor - clean recording and some great guitar work.
1,Question??,"I want to purchase this book, but it's never in stock. So I wanted to know..if I do buy it and wait for it to restock..Does this book tell you what Vet care your Potbelly will need? And it goes over training as well....and I see behavior. The all in one book? If so, then I will wait for it to restock. Thank you!"
3,"Not a music CD, in case you didn't notice....","In case you didn't notice, this is not a music CD. What I mean by that is that this does not have Godsmack music on it. Rather, there is the voice of a british accented lady explaning Godsmack's past...So, if you are a die-hard fan, and must know everything possible about the band, then this is for you. However, if you just want music, and can look into the band by other means, not payiung ~$12, then this is for you...Just though I might tell anyone unaware, and also if you don't believe me, check out the track previews.....BTW, I gave it a rating of three though it deserves 2.5, half way....."
3,"A good start, but needs better review","This is another fine ColdFusion book, with plenty of real world examples. A nice step away from the ""Hello World"" examples everyone seems to include. The biggest disappointment in the book was the typos and errors throughout. I found myself debugging code just because the author and publisher didn't proof read more carefully. A fine book, but purchase a used copy, a book with this many errors isn't worth full price."
1,"False Advertising, Poor Customer Service","I ordered this item from Adorama Camera via the Amazon web site. Adorama shipped the wrong item to me and then claimed that Amazon was at fault. They said that I could purchase the ALB-G album directly from them for $19.00, and refused to honor their advertiszed price on Amazon (which at the time of this posting was $6.95... it has been this price for 10 days at least, since I placed my order 10 days before I posted this.)Also, in speaking with their reps on the phone, they flat-out lied and said that Amazon sells their items and that any problems with the order were Amazon's fault. They were also extremely rude.Needless to say, I will never purchase anything from Adorama Camera again."
4,"Justuss, kicks","This thrid album is Snows best album since 12"".My personal favorite track is ""mash up da nation"". Also, If you an't herd the (hip-hop)remix single to mash up da nation, check it out.(only on wax)But, the overall album is dope, smooth vocals with deep base. Luv the album Snow! When you gonna drop one more?"
5,New Favorite,"My son got this as a gift for his 4th birthday. We've never seen these before but the second he unwrapped it, it became his newest, most bestest toy ever!We're going to buy more with some of his birthday money!"
4,GOOD SONG WRITING,"THIS CD HAS SOME REALLY WELL WRITTEN SONGS ON IT - TOO BAD THE SOUND QUALITY IS BELOW AVERAGE - I REMEMBER THE CASSETTE TAPE SOUNDING BETTER THAN THIS CD - NO LIE!! - I'VE ALWAYS LIKE THIS ALBUM AND STILL DO, I JUST KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLARITY OF SOUND - A COMMENT TO THE FIRST REVIEW - THIS IS NOT A 70'S ALBUM - IF YOU KNEW SOMEONE ON THIS GROUP, I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD REMEMBER WHAT YEAR THIS ALBUM CAME OUT!! - WHERE DID WHITE WOLF EVER GO? - GOOD CD"
2,"great cd, great band","Formerly known as Warrior throughout the 70's white wolf dominated the club scenes in Canada for years. After loosing in court for their name they changed to White Wolf. Fortunately their music did not suffer. I had the pleasure of traveling with and getting to know the band quite well in the early to mid 80's and have experienced their powerhouse (Cams new band)live show 100's of times. BOth cd's are fantasic, if you like the metal of the 80's. Tremendous vocals with fantastic guitar work. Very good stuff.Rob"
5,Awesome book,"I recommend Catcher with a Glass Arm, by Matt Christopher with five stars. It's all about a catcher named Jody Sinclair who can't throw to third base. He's scared to use all his power. To make things worse, he gets hit by a ball and is scared to go in the batter's box. His friend's dad helps Jody to get better at batting and throwing. Jody is surprised that he can throw and hit better then ever. This book got my attention when I first started reading it. Catcher with a Glass Arm is good for kids who understand baseball."
3,Curious mom checks out a Matt Christopher sports novel....,"Age appropriate sports read for 9 to 12 year olds. The main character, Jody Sinclair, is struggling as a catcher in throwing-down runners to second base. Jody is beginning to be scare of the ball as a hitter also. One of Jody's team-mates' Dad, Jim Myers helps Jody work on his baseball playing skills. Jody has a black pet cat named Midnight and Jody showed great love and care for the cat. I thought the author adding Midnight as a secondary storyline was admirable."
3,Give It All You've Got!,"I read a book called Catcher With A Glass Arm by Matt Christopher.I liked this book because it helped me overcome my fears of being a catcher.My favorite character is Moonie because he learns to be friends with Jody, the main character, and helps Jody not to be afraid of the ball.Jody realizes that he should throw the ball as hard as he can and not to step out of the batter's box because he doesn't want to get hit by the ball. I didn't like that they didn't say who got the scores. I would suggest this book to anyone who needs help to throw or catch a ball."
3,It's about a kid who freezes up when he throws,"It starts out with a kid whos name is Andy and he puts out for baseball and he gets to be catcher but when he tries to throw to second base he frezes up and throws too far are, to short."
3,It was a good book.,This book is about a boy who gets made fun of because he can't throw the ball on a fly to second base.
5,One of their best,My title says it all. This is probably their best album aside from their country album.Yes I know it's a bit different (the country album) but if you don't have it you shouldget that too. You really can't go wrong with Ween but this is one of my favorites.
4,"very good, but not their best","This was the first Ween album I heard, and it got me hooked, but did not really prepare me for the full Ween experience that lay hidden from me in their earlier work. While the country album specifically tackled one genre, this one is closer to Chocolate and Cheese in terms of its diversity. They are also getting closer to the pop music style that they conquer in White Pepper. All of the tracks on here are very good, and are more refined than their pre-country stuff. In fact, these tunes sound like the most completely composed and engineered of them all, e.g. ""Mutilated Lips"". On the other hand, the roughness that gets the ""explicit lyrics"" label is still there, e.g. ""The Blarney Stone""."
5,powerful,"ween are gods and so should be treated like equals , in their world we a all genius's !!!!! i love this band!!!!"
2,commercial,"old fans will be disappointed of the low creative content and craziness. Too much love-lyrics, not as satyrical as usual. Still good recording in excellent quality"
5,"""The Mollusk"" is the best Ween album.","Owning all six of Ween's CD's, I can tell you that this one is far and away the best. Ween has come along way since God Ween Satan (though that's a fine album, too). After everyone thought that Ween had gone country, they release The Mollusk and blow them all away. There are more serious songs on this one, but they all totally kick ass! Ween has something for everyone: from Irish bar-setted ""The Blarney Stone"" to the Calypso ""Ocean Man"" to the zany ""I'm Dancing in the Show Tonight"". Long live Ween!"
3,Lamborghini -- 40 years,"Nicely published, great cover, very good quality paper, excellent photos. Contains much material not generally available prior to this work. The focus is on financial issues, various owners of the company, top managers and engineers involved, and other aspects of the company (not so much the cars). Interesting coverage of the marine engines built for offshore racing and some material on the various F1 efforts. The coverage of the early years of the factory is more sketchy. I found a large number of glaring and important errors throught the book and this was disappointing. Surely a quick pre-publication review by a person even moderately knowledgable in the subject could have caught many of the larger mistakes."
4,Nice book ... but,"I've been collecting Lamborghini automobilia and books for over twenty years now, and I have every English written book published on Lamborghini.When this one was announced I pre-ordered it and when it finally arrived I had the same sentiment as some of the other reviewers here, it's a nice book, but there are a lot of errors, and wrong captions with photo's.Other than that it's a nice book, perhaps some of the models were overlooked or didn't get as much attention as we would like, especially the new models like the Gallardo, Murcielago Barchetta and the Murcielago R-GT, all press photo's, but I guess at the time of writing there weren't too many cars available to photograph.All in all a nice book, good addition to any collection or Lamborghini enthusiast, but not a source book or encyclopedia on Lamborghini, just a nice selection of photo's and easy to read story."
2,"great story, but...","The story is great, well researched, and offered many new insights. But the big flaw are the pictures. As another reviewer wrote, there as just too many mistakes. Mixing the Diablo for a Countach is simply ...! Didn't the author see the final print? The book has a strange lay-out. Thanks to the format half of the page has text, the other half is plain-blank. Enough blank space for many more pictures. That's the book's other picture-problem: There aren't many. No pictures, except one, of prototypes. There is also far too much attention for the Audi-age, with a whole chapter about the Gallardo. This section has loads of Gallardo-pictures, but all of them are factory-photo's I already saw in various car-magazines. Almost no attention for the lm002 either. You do need to buy another Lamborghini photo-book to get the picture."
2,Disapointed,There are lots of incorrect captions in this book that annoyed me very much! They were so blatant. but my biggest beef was that there were cars talked about with NO pictures or one small picture from say the rear the quarter. i would definitely NOT recommend this book and the only reason why I bought was because I pre-ordered it aka bought it site unseen.
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I see other comments that are similar to my opinion. I thought this book was a total waste of time. Self-indulgent, rambling ideas that seemed there only to demonstrate how much the author believes he is brilliant. I can't believe he has so many books and university endorsements. It is rare for me to dislike a book, but this one made me angry. I read the entire thing, so I gave it a fair chance. As a busy consultant, I don't have time to lose on things like this."
1,Dissapointed,"Since this book was published by HBR, I really expected it to have a lot more to do with changing business thinking. What I found, however, was what seemed like a psych text book that was applied to business as an after though. I found it to have little practical value."
4,Insight in to how opinions are developed,"An interesting take on how opinions are developed and what is effective for changing them in various contexts. This impacts lots of group dynamics, including companies and how to market effectively."
3,Moderately Interesting,"I found the analysis of some mind changing examples much more instructive than the very general ""7 levers."" Even so, most of the analyses were still not detailed enough. I felt as though I had the view from 30 thousand feet and wanted a better view into the process.There is a lot of good information here, but keep expectations moderate."
2,Anecdotal,"I'm disappointed with this book. Gardner spends the first few chapters seemingly laying a foundation for what's to come, then squanders it with essentially a bunch of anecdotes. It really seems less like an integrated, well-researched theory than ""My opinion, by a famous psychologist."" Quite often it feels as though he's stretching his ""7 factors for changing minds"" to fit his anecdotes. It also feels as though he's casting around for stories to throw in. ""Oh, hey, I had a friend who changed people's minds! Why don't I include him?"" And so he does. I had the distinct impression, as other readers seem to, that he wrote this book under duress, or because he and Harvard Business Publishing thought there might be a willing market. Unfortunately, I was part of that market and I've now learned to trust their brand a little less next time."
1,Major disappointment here,"I waited in anticipation for this book to be released. The topic, coupled with Mr. Gardner's strong c.v., led me to believe that this would be a seminal book. Sadly, it was difficult to get beyond Mr. Gardner's entrenched political bias shown (reflected in the minds of many Harvard professors) in his illustrations in one chapter after another. We've all heard it before: George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan as simple-minded, latter stage former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as arrogant. If I wanted a book on politics, well that's another matter. How about Mr. Gardner changing his own mind!"
1,Ersatz science,"I admit, I only read the first hundred or so pages, then skimmed the rest. As Lincoln once observed, you don't have to eat the whole egg to know it's rotten.It seems to me the first half of the book is filled with Gardner arguments trying to illustrate how complicated his science has become, so that the author can spend the rest of the book proposing solutions. But I doubt seriously that very many people lead quotidian lives anywhere near as complicated as the author makes out."
1,Disappointing and long,"I found this book disappointing. Its pages drag on and on but never deal with the topic. It addresses why, but not the how. I was looking for the how."
1,Changing Minds: The Acadmics Viewpoint,A very boring book written by a true academic trying to help hands on people. I would suggest reading a book written by someone who actually influences people on a daily basis rather than this book which is written by someone who read about it somewhere else.
5,wonderful writing exercises,"I used this book in my high school English class, and remembered how helpful this was. I ordered one for myself after I graduated, and now use it to sharpen writing ideas that were stuck in my mind. I am able to get my thoughts down onto paper, and they are more vibrant than what they were in my head. A great read for aspiring writers and poets!"
4,An enjoyable journaling experience.,"I purchased this book to help me keep consistent with my journaling. On the days I ""drew blank"" when I took pen and pad in hand, I read a chapter of this book. I enjoyed the exercises and the experience. I may pull it out again for next year's journal to see what I come up with then."
4,Not bad at all,This album was not bad for a new band. I won it on a radio station and had no clue who they were but found out that they were pretty good.
3,On the high end of three,"Not too much to say concerning the music, which is what they all say: a darn good band in need of a single and some air time. I'll tell ya' what's odd, though. On the back of this album, three of the four bandmembers look like Ben Folds or one of his Five. It's uncanny if not creepy...could the key lie in harmony?"
4,Great Gift,This creative and original book made me immediately think of my mother. I purchased it for her for Mother's Day. Any literature buff will greatly appreciate this gift.
4,Dailybard! An Almanack with Attitude,"I would recommend this book of verse to those in the U.K. as well as those from the Author's country. Each verse intrigues and inspires, educates and amuses. I learned facts of the States previously unknown and although in some cases somewhat esoteric to both sides of the pond, they are nonetheless well researched. I know, I have checked!This is a fun book to dip into and whether you agree or not with the facts, this piques your interest and you have to admire the construction of verse. The perfect gift!"
5,Another Aho masterpiece.,"In a social science world where humans are not really that important, the work of Jim Aho is seen as a refreshing reminder of why many of us became social scientists. In this book, the latest in a long line of Aho classics, he explores the construction of things of our world. Your view of life and of the social sciences will never be the same again. I would read Aho's other books most notably the Politics of Righteousness and This Thing of Darkness as companions to this text. In this triology, you get to see the work of one of the most important social theorists of the past 20 years."
1,Great album BUT,"The let two tracks are destroyed and useless. scratches on other tracks.can't be fixed. Not very pleased, nowhere close to condition described.Very displeased with misrepresentation and with CD."
1,Taken,The CD that I received was damaged. Several of the songs were scratched and was not identifiable. I guess you get what you pay for. Last time I purchase anything at this location.
2,"This is a greatest hits album, nothing more.","If your just getting into the doors and want to hear some of their best masterpieces, by this cd. But let me tell you this album is missing many many hit doors songs. I was completely devasted when i bought this album. i didnt look much into it i just bought it. Its missing one of their tops songs, Peace Frog. I don't understand how its not on this album! Other than that its missing songs like The Chrystal Ship, Back Door man, The Unknown Soldier, Soul Kitchen, Waiting for the Sun, and the list goes on. I Highly recomend buying The Doors Legacy, Absoulute Best over this album."
1,Doors greatest hits compilation CD isn't my taste!,"I've alrady got all these songs on my Doors anthology collection CD disc except for song track number 12 called ""The Ghost Song"". Which I don't have but hey in my opinion I would recommend Best ofto get more perspective and the full learning history view about Jim Morrison in rock'n roll music that i'd listened too!"
5,This CD entitles the life of James Douglas Morrison,This cd has all the doors greatest hits. It also emphasizes Jims poetry
3,Great CD,"The CD has all the good songs. It doesn't mess arouind with the ""DEEP POETIC, DRUG INDUCED"" jargon, that the double disc features."
4,Does justice for the most part,"My favorite tracks are Riders of the Storm, People are Strange and Light my Fire. It's only 12 songs, however, which is kinda suspect. You'd think for such a famous band, there would be more. The design on the cd is awesome, by the way. It's sad that Jim Morrison had to die 12 years before I was born. There aren't many interesting people out there like he was."
2,As if we needed it...,"Here we go with another Greatest Hits album. The Doors released a record called ""13"" way back while they were still around (I believe they released it in '70.) It included their hit singles up till then. Since that time they have put out quite a few ""Best of""s and ""Greatest Hits""s packages. Along comes this, a single disc. Keep in mind that the 2CD package ""Best of"" is still in print. But no, The Doors make it a point to re-release the Greatest Hits, throwing an enhancement on and a new cover to entice the thirsty new fan. Elektra records is pretty shameless. And it continues on the boxset, which features a ""Band Favorites"" which is a kind of Greatest Hits. Here's a simple equation for the Doors and Elektra: rare, unedited, undoctored releases = happy fans = more $. But why should they bother when they can continue to make $$$ off the same old stuff? Avoid this release. Spend a little more and get the 2CD ""Best of"" if you want a taste of this great rock band."
4,OK was Touch Me really necessary?,"Don't get me wrong, this release has some great music on it, including Break on Through, Light My Fire, The End, Love Her Madly, L.A. Woman, Roadhouse Blues and Riders on the Storm. BUT...it also has its fair share of bad music, such as Touch Me, near-unlistenable. Jim Morrison, this so-called American Poet (and he is a good songwriter) can't scrape together much more than ""I'm gonna love you till the stars fall from the sky..."" That and it's flat-out pretentious. I am sorry. Don't really care too much for Hello I Love You or the Ghost Song either, but that's just me. And where is The Unknown Soldier?At least they skipped Wild Child..."
2,"It,s okay",I know there are alot of doors fans out there and you are entilteld to that. Riders on the storm is good and touch me is good. As far as music vocal harmony and music the Beatles are the best. GodBless
5,the best doors compilation,"i like this doors compilation the best because it's the most modest. The doors only released 6 albums, 2 of which were during a doors slump. This is no grounds for a 2-disc, 30 song compilation like ""Legacy: the absolute best"", which takes 8 songs from the self-titled debut, which only had 11 songs, i mean you have to leave something for the album-buyers like me. This one only takes the songs that were actually hits"
3,Great Compilation...,"This Greatest Hits collection of ""The Doors"" is an excellent collection of the band's greatest hits from their first album to their last. All of those great tunes from ""The Doors"" you hear on the radio are now available on one CD. Although the song selection is very good, the reason I rated this album 3 stars is because there are a couple of Doors favorites missing such as, ""Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)."" For any fan of ""The Doors"", buy this album and you will love it. Rest in Peace, Jim Morrison."
4,A Must Have!!!!!,"This cd has everything, all the Door's best songs such as Light my Fire, Hello I Love You and LA Women. The only bad part of this cd is The Ghost Song. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY RECORDED THAT?"
4,Good DOORS compilation,"This particular GREATEST HITS collection is an ideal album.The DOORS were one of THE most inconsistent bands in history-- for proof, compare MORRISON CAFE to their debut album, or stack up THE SOFT PARADE against STRANGE DAYS. The former are drivelbound, the latter are generally good quality.The in-concert ""Roadhouse Blues"" is excellent, and Morrison's thoughts afterward chillingly prescient. The edited version here of ""The End"" is really ALL you need of this overhyped dabble into Freudian psychology. As for the rest of this set: solid material-- worth owning. Recommended.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 55:50"
2,Don't buy this.......please,"This is a horrible compilation of of an amazing band. It is missing so many of their hits (peace frog, alambama song, backdoor man, the wasp, spanish caravan) the list goes on. If you want a cheap single disc collection of the doors' best stuff then get the very best of the doors (which isnt that great either.) Otherwise go with legacy, that is by far the best doors compilation out there. Even if you dont even know the doors that well and u only know a few of their songs, this is still not the right choice. The worst part about this album is the version of ""The End"" that is inlcuded. The only reason i didnt give it 1 star is because any cd that is all doors songs will be great. But this is an inexcusable collection."
4,Gypsy Music form the Camargue,This is the same album in the following listing. Only the price is different. Check the following listing for the review.
1,Mystery book ???,"This book is written like a murder mystery, not a scientific book on evidence for past lives as the cover indicates.The first chapter opening sentences are as follows:""It is late, nearly lightless. Smoke freom a million dung fires hang in the headlights as the Maruti microbus bangs along the narrow, cratered hardpack ....."".The first 6 chapters are all written like this, I couldn't take any more and threw the book aside. I wanted clean documented evidence with pro's and con's discussed about each case, not a detailed narative about the travels of Tom Shroder.The title is misleading, it's a travel diary !!"
2,'Scenic' Taxi Ride,"The title of this book promises ""compelling evidence"" but what it offers instead is only ""compelling writing."" For all of Tom Shroder's self-proclaimed healthy skepticism he really offers the reader nothing but second and third-hand stories that are all easily explainable and full of gaping holes. The fact that many of these cases come from cultures that believe in reincarnation (i.e. the social norm says reincarnation is an everyday event) should warn the reader that what follows may well be tainted and skewed data. Hardly a scientific work, Old Souls, is just another pseudo-science [take-off]. Admittedly, Shroder's writing style is punchy and journalistic, taking the reader along for an interesting ride. After a few chapters though it gets ""old"" and the ""souls"" all appear to be (perhaps well-intentioned) con artists taking two white guys in a foreign country for an endless series of ""scenic"" taxi rides that never actually go anywhere."
3,Scientific attempt to unviel truth beyond the West?,"Hi I enjoyed this valid attempt to establish a realm of reality mostly unthought of by those with a western scientific worldview, however the absence of insight from certain other disciplines and cultures, gave me the sense that contrary to appearence, this was a biased work which was unwilling to consider alternative reality objectively. Feel free to write for further comment. a1040watch@yahoo.com"
5,Old Souls:,This book was very interesting. I received it very fast. It really makes one think of the spirit world. I liked it a lot.Thanks for the fast delivery.
5,Old Souls,This is one of the most interesting books ever to chronological children thbat are able recall their past lives. It gives excellent accounts to give the reader scientific evidence of reincarnation. It still puts the ball back in the reader's court.Love from Both Sides: A True Story of Soul Survival and Sacred Sexuality
3,very young children-should ring a bell,"Suppose- please remember this is just suppose- we all lived together in the spirit world before we came to earth to get a body.Think of deja vu, kindred spirits,.or I know wev'e met before-but find there is no way you could have in this life. It has been noticed now and again,that very small children seem to be in touch with that spirit world.References escape me,it's been a while since reincarnation interested me.For someone contemplating suicide,if we continue our supposition,-this earth life is our probation,it decides (we decide) where we will spend our eternal progression.- The ""catch"" being you end up in the spirit world again in the same condition you left this earth. For non beleivers there is the tibetan book of the dead, for bible scholars too much is interpeted or mis- either for or against,apologies to the jesuits."
2,Riding Stevenson's Coat Tails,"This book has been done before. By the author's very own mentor, Ian Stevenson. It's essentially the same collection of stories of children who believe they lived past lives, by the original author's sidekick. And not half as compelling. On their own merit, the stories are very interesting. But the writer doesn't know whether or not he believes his own subject matter, and goes out of his way to say so three times on every page. Either that, or he does believe it and feels he has to dodge the debunkers. He didn't believe it, so couldn't make me believe it. But I believed it when I read Stevenson's version. As David Spade said when Mariah Carey rerecorded ""I'll Be There"", ""Honey, there's a reason Michael Jackson did this song. So YOU didn't have to.""There's a reason Ian Stevenson wrote his book. So Tom Schroder didn't have to."
2,A bit redundant,"There was a lot information in this book to disseminate. It could have been shorter. Interesting, nonetheless. Very provocative and rang true."
2,the subtitle should be:,"""my personal exploration of reincarnation cases."" the number of pages spent discussing actual cases is few. the author spends much more time working through his own doubts on the subject and describing the scenery of the countries he visited. it is not badly written, but you will only througholy enjoy it if you are looking for a travel guide, an autobiography, and some information on reincarnation."
2,old souls,Boring! Too much about the travel and descriptions of the areas he was seeing. Found myself skipping pages and just reading the few cases he wrote about. It didn't offer much.
3,Old Souls,"I liked the book but it wasn't what I expected. I wanted more stories and a lot of the book is very descriptive of places and things that I thought irrelevant. In the end it did all come together; But again, I expected something else."
3,This book doesn't present any clear cut information,"I felt more understanding on this topic after having read this book. However, I felt the book was presented with too much fluff. It was not organized very well and it made it difficult to follow the writer's interpretation, and it did not give the author a strong voice to allow you to feel his story. What little information you did pull from the book was quite interesting though."
3,"Fascinating material, not well written","Although I thought the stories and evidence presented in the book was extremely interesting and convincing, the way it was written (somewhat like a journal from the skeptic's point of view) wasn't very appealing. If you are seriously considering buying this book though, keep in mind that I personally was looking for an easier, ""can't put it down"" sort of book. My ""3 star rating"" is the result of my craving for more drama than this offered."
3,Kind of chunky,"I thought this product would go on more like a lotion, but I put in on at night and the next day I had little chunks of it all over my belly. I does smell really good. I'm not sure, but if you rubbed it in with your hand after applying it, these chunks may go away."
2,Too Sticky!,"The Bella B Tummy Honey stick arrived at my house via UPS and sat in the hot sun until I got home. Once I opened it, it was all hot and sticky from being outside all day. I put it in the frigde and let it cool over night. The next day I used it and it was still sticky and grainy agaist my skin. Needless to say I haven't used it since."
2,"Buy the Tub, Not the Stick","I have ordered the 4 oz. tub of Bella B's Honey Butter and liked it, thus far. I am only 15 weeks along in my pregnancy though, so I am still not sure on if it is effective on fighting stretch marks.However, this stick, which I thought would save me time (since I wouldn't have to wash my hands), is NOT the answer.THE WORST PART: It is gritty. It actually looks like there are pebbles of some sort in it. It goes on very rough, it's sort of unpleasant, and my shirt made it all ball up. I had it all over the place!ANOTHER BAD FEATURE: When this showed up, I had bought two. They were both in a plastic cover; but, they were all greasy on the outside. Even after I took the plastic off, the container was greasy. I had to wash it off with soap or I couldn't even hold onto it tightly without losing grip.The only good thing about it is, that it seems to keep my tummy moist and it smells just the same.Go with the 4 oz. tub!"
5,no stretch marks for me,"I used this through both of my pregnancies and have ZERO stretch marks. (Gained 35 pounds each time.) Maybe I have good genes? Not sure, but I would definately use it again."
1,Not As Good As I Expected,"I bought two because it was BOGO at the time. As another reviewer said, they arrived wrapped in plastic, but they were still greasy on the outside. It was pretty greasy to use too. My main problem with this product is that, while it says ""anti-itch formula,"" it actually made my skin itchy with small red dots that hadn't happened before using this product. So, I stopped using it after a few days. The only thing I liked about it was that it smells nice. It was definitely not as good as it is advertised to be."
3,good to begin with,"the book is written simply and easy to read. i expected it to be more extensive, and to have more details on every subject. good for guidlines and general perspection but can not be relied solely. good for beginning with..."
5,Must Read for Parenting,"I've read a handful of parenting books the last couple years and am pleasantly surprised with my current reading of ""Positive Discipline A-Z"" from Jane Nelson. I wish I had it sooner!! I went ahead and got ""Positive Discipline for Preschoolers"" and have found it even more resourceful for the age I'm currently dealing with. If your finding yourself in a similar situation of the awful toddlerhood stage then you have to read this book!"
4,A little too good to be true,"I like the general idea of the book, but all in all I think some of the solutions were too easy and would not work with my child. A good reference book and I would recommend reading it."
4,Ok,Just ok. Talked more about what not to do than what to do. Didn't give enough instruction on exactly what to do.
1,Charming Cartoons - Terrible DVD by Sony,"I loved these cartoons as a child and I still like them. However, this compilation is an abomination. The intro to each cartoon has been removed. The DVD just goes from one cartoon to the next without any intro or title card. Originally there was the theme song opening, followed by a short title board for each cartoon. Well, all we have here is the theme song played once at the beginning of the DVD, and closing credits at the very end. Everything else, including all the title cards, has been stripped away. It's bad enough we can't get these episodes as part of a complete Underdog package, but now we can't even get the complete Go-Go Gophers on their own DVD. The cartoons themselves look and sound good, but 75% of the charm of these has been edited out. Save your money and don't buy this garbage. Hopefully the Tennessee Tuxedo package is better, but I doubt it."
3,Incomplete DVD,"It's true that The Best of Go-go Gophers is not thecomplete series. I don't know why. I""ll be in the Army pretty soon, and Regulation 35706 expressly states ""Every cartoon coming on DVD should be complete."""
5,Brings back memories,What a great way to remember your childhood Saturday mornings and be able to share with your children.
4,"silly, silly fun","A collection of really funny and socially engaging cartoons. The choice of heroes in this series is a win for me! ;) All in all, some adults might not have as much fun as others, but kids will like this (and big kids, too!). yes, it has stereotypes, but it pokes fun at both sides, mostly the bad guys taking it the hardest. Love the Kit Carson/ Teddy Roosevelt/ John Wayne parodies. A funny take on something that wasn't so funny for a lot people--being forced onto a reservation. Here's one for the Under Dog!"
4,Oldies but goodies,These cartoons are just the way I remember them... perfect. Upon seeing these again I was laughing just as I did as a kid growning up. These are a must have for anyone collecting the older cartoons.
5,THE BEST OF GO GO GOPHERS,The Best of Go-Go GophersThis is a cartoon classic favorite from the oldunderdog cartoons. Very enjoyable and very funny.PAUL.
2,"Read The ""Fine Print""","Make sure your unit has USB 2.0 which is high speed USB. My brand new Pentium 4 1.8 ghz machine doesn't! USB 1.0 seems to be the standard. The Yamaha performs like any other CD/RW otherwise.The Nero softward included only works with the Yamaha device. If you have another CD/RW on your machine, or want to use another device it will not work!the advertised DiskT@2 doesn't seem to load with a regular USB port, therefore this enhancement that is so highly touted, will not even load from Nero!All in all, it's just not what it's cracked up to be unless you happend to have the perfectly configured system."
4,JOOSE CD,"Bought this as a gift for a friend. Since this is an older CD, it was hard to find, so I'm glad they had it in stock.Delivered on time and in good quality with plastic wrapping over CD."
4,I enjoy the music of David Grubbs.,"The wordplay and poetry/lyrics are great. I was glad they were legible unlike those included in THE THICKET. I wish you could just turn on the radio and hear songs like this on ""light ninety something"" stations because it is palatable enough musically to mix into the mainstream, singer-songwriter genre. At times I feel the vocals even sound like Christopher Cross. The music is mostly acoustic but with inventive rhythms and instrumentation. So what separates this from something like Dave Matthews Band or Bare Naked Ladies? Right now I'm too tired to describe why. Just trust the fact that this is the same genius behind the spazz-rockers Bastro (whom I'm convinced are the most underrated band ever) and Gastr Del Sol. No matter what Grubbs is involved with, it is almost always music that has never been created before."
5,all,i have read all your books everyone is excellent i have stayed up to the early morning knowning i had to go to early classes it didnt matter because i had to finish the books. i just wanted to say keep up the good work. PLEASE WRITE MORE!!
4,"A little better than your average ""street"" novel","This was a very good book. K'wan has come a long way since ""Gangsta."" This book is about a typical hustler that rises to the top. What sets this book apart from the others is the interesting ending and the cast of characters. K'wan has developed people you will either love or hate. It is the invocation of that kind of emotion that makes this a great book. A must read."
5,"""THIS BOOK GETS WAY MORE STARS""","IF I COULD HAVEN GIVEN THIS BOOK 1,000,IT WOULD HAVE THEM. THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN NAMED K-DAWG,K-DAWG WHO HAS JUST COME OUT OF JAIL WANTS TO FOLLOW HIS CHILDHOOD DREAM WITH HIS CHILDHOOD FRIENDS...ONCE K-DAWG COMES UP IN THE GAME HE TRIES TO BECOME THE KING OF NEW YORK...HE TAKES NOTHING FROM NOONE ,LET ALONE TRUST ANYONE...NOW THIS BOOK IS ONE THAT IS REALLY ""TRUE TO THE GAME""...THE ENDING HAD ME KIND OF IN THE MIX,BUT AFTER YOU READ IT YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND. YO K'WAN YO YOU NEED TO HIT US UP WITH A PART TWO CAUSE I'M REALLY FEELIN THIS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT PICK IT UP!"
2,The Testament,"I knew what the author was trying to do in this book and I respect him for that, but in my oppinion, the book appeared to be hurried. The author has several excellent characters in the book, the best is Demon, a lean, mean, negro killing machine, who I would have liked to have read more about in the book. The author appeared to put a lot of thought into the book but seemed to have a lot of difficulty with expressing his ideas and quite simply, the book lacked the energy that it needed to make it the extraordinary story that I had expected it to be. The book, eventhough filled with several twists and turns, I think, is very predictable, and the ending went just as I had expected. In short, the author does have skills, but unfortunetly, this is not the novel that they are best displayed."
1,The Hood Book???,"I'm really tired of our people having a limited imagination when it comes to writing. The Hood, Ghetto, Pimps and guns... is that all you have to offer? I read novels every day and will not recommend Road Dawgz to my Sons or anyone of my students."
5,Michelle,I read Gangsta and I enjoyed it. K'wan really did his thing with Road Dawgz. This book is off the hook. I had two days off from work and read Road Dawgz in one day.... I could'nt put the book down. I see best seller written all over this book. Keep up the good work K'wan.
4,GDWR,"Guitarist John Hart has been around for some time, serving as the sideman in Jack McDuff band. He has also released four albums previously, two of them under Concord label and have saxist Chris Potter as a guest. Although Hart's is very much in the tradition (jazz box guitar, clean tone, standard tunes), he has a penchant for good melodies (as apparent in the title song in this album) and picking effective notes in his improvisation. With this album, I wish John gets the wider recognition he deserves."
3,Great watch: but don't get Velcro strap,"I like this watch. I received it as a gift from my wife. it's lightweight and I've gotten great use out of it while running. I trained for a marathon and was able to mark out miles with the ""lap"" function to time my splits. My one complaint is the velcro strap. I'd recommend getting the model with the plastic strap. The velcro/cloth strap doesn't hold up to the sweat and wear and tear of running. Within a week it looked really worn and the ""Ironman"" logos on the strap had even worn off."
4,"Nice watch, but Bulky","I like this watch, but I would mention that it is fairly large for a sports watch. It's much bigger than the non ""Shock"" version that I replaced. The extra size is in the thickness. Other than that, its really nice. I like the velcro strap and the fact that it weighs almost nothing."
4,E-Ticket to Memory Lane,"In 1971, I was a high school freshman exploring new music. One Of the San Francisco Bay area stations, KIOI (101.3), featured Wednesday night ""Stereo Spectacular"". My Dad and I would fire up the Harmon-Kardon stereo in the living room every Wednesday night and await what new treats Jim Gabbert had up his sleeve. ""I Like What I Like"" was the lead song at 7pm one night and we made the windows rattle! Wotta base line! I went out and got the album the next day! Played it to death many years ago. Love to get a CD copy and re-live that old thrill!"
5,A Wonderfull film!!,This film has it all. It will make you laugh and cry. You get attached to the characters. There are plenty of action scenes. The actors are great in it. I knew nothing about this film before going to see it as there were no ads on tv for it. What a very pleasant surprise. The people in the theatre with me all seemed to enjoy the movie also. I recommend this movie to all who enjoy action movies and to every movie fan because it goes well beyond just an action film.
2,Only OK,"A veiled attempt to imitate much of Gladiator with King Arthur and Merlin thrown in. Sorry, it doesn't work! Save your time and money."
4,Athurian legend source,Good Recreation of the end of the Roman Empire and a connection with the Arthurian legends.Acting was satisfactory! get it!
3,A valuable contribution to our understanding of the last days of the Roman Empire,"This movie is worth seeing, although I was a bit surprised in seeing Colin Firth in this role. For those interested in the last days of the Roman Empire, this film is educational. One might wonder, however, about the tie-in to King Arthur at the end."
2,Accuracy be damned....,"It's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" meets ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" meets ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" meets the mask from ""Kingdom of Heaven"" meets, I think, the bridge from ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" meets way too much spinning with swords meets a speech with full orchestra meets...the list goes on and on and on.I really wanted to like this movie but maybe given the plethora of Roman/Medieval/Robin Hood movies/TV shows, this makes it seem somewhat used up. Historical accuracy withstanding, this should have been a bit darker, given the period of which it represents. But given some lush greens and deep blue waters under sunny skies; not happening.It seems to have been more of a vehicle to test the ""leading hero"" of Colin Firth. I do enjoy watching him, but this just wasn't the right one for him. To be fair, while he is excellent in English period films, he can hold his own in modern ones, too. I just couldn't get into this one."
3,I liked the book better!,The film script is a departure from the original novel ... but good acting and some splendid scenery nevertheless makes it a good movie.
2,Somewhat silly but not terrible,"I had expected better based on the previews. It was an interesting spin on the idea of a Roman genesis for the Arthurian legend but there was some silliness along the way. Things started going downhill with the introduction of the warrior-chick from Byzantium (yeah, she's hot but not very believable). Then they walk all the way to Britian through Gaul (followed, of course by the bad guys). Etc, etc.Overall the plot is weak and predictable. No acting or dialogue to get excited about. There are some cool fight-scenes, in spite of super-chick. It was a stretch but TLL did make an interesting connection between Rome and King Arthur.Not recommended."
2,Star wars in Britainia,"Luke, Leia, Obi Wan, Han Solo, and Darth Vader--they are all here, but with different names. The historical and geographical accuracy are the same as in Star Wars too. No wookies, though. That cost a star."
4,Pleasant Escape,"This is a pleasant, well-photographed film that combines the end of the Roman occupation of Britannia and the Arthurian legend. The acting is good, nice little bits of humor, fairly good chemistry between actors, and an excellent musical soundtrack -- a nice diversion when one needs it.It's staying in my movie library."
3,Last Legion,"The movie was not what I expected. I expected a historical type of epic. It was more fantasy, (historically inaccurate), like a Lord of the Rings or King Arthur movie. I am glad I saw it to satisfy my curiosity, but I would not see it again or recommend it."
1,Dismal Fiasco,"For anyone who loves great history blended with gripping drama and action, I suggest that you gouge your eyes out with a stylus before watching this festering turd. This film manages to to treat both the Fall of the Roman Empire and the Arthurian legend with equally sloppy disdain. History and logic take a backseat in this alleged historical drama. Colin Firth and Kevin McKidd flail helplessly about in this mishmash of a mess. For God's sake, the invading hordes are reduced to a handful of ruffians who take Rome by walking in the back door and saying ""boo"". The research on this film is so shoddy that McKidd's character is actually given a woman's name. Firth's frustration with the utter crappiness of this fiasco is apparent in every scene. In the name of sanity, please do not watch this film for any reason. You have been warned."
2,Boooo.,"Ugh! I'm just so disappointed with this movie and the performance of one of my favorite actors, Colin Firth. It was almost as if Colin didn't want the role, but HAD to take the role and throughout the movie seemed simply annoyed at having to do anything at all that resembling acting.Then you have the storyline, predictable and overdone. ""You've seen the story of King Arthur, and then saw it retold, but here's the real real REAL story folks, the one that we reveal in all its glory!"" BLAH! I think my disappointment turned into anger when I felt my intelligence being insulted by the revealing of ""Escaliber"" and nope, that's not a typo, ""Escaliber."" I suppose we've gotten it wrong all these many years.The only performance that kept me from slitting my wrists was that of Ben Kingsley and even that of Peter Mullan who's performance in Tristan and Isolde came through once more for this film.So, that's about it. Sorry, the movie drained me of all energy. It was just a blech moment prolonged!"
3,Tepid approval,"I understand the viewpoint of the reviewers who hated this movie, but I didn't think it was that bad. It deals with a fascinating period of history that I've never seen treated before, the sets and costumes were absolutely first-rate, and even though I didn't think Mr. Darcy could pull off the role of a grizzled warrior, I thought he did a good job. Yeah, it was cheesy, cliched and p.c. in parts, but I think it had a fresh take on things and was mildly entertaining."
2,This one plays fast and loose with history...,"...but remains entertaining. We had just seen ""Iron Man"" at the theater earlier in the day (a phenomenal film) and were still in a movie mood, so we dropped by Blockbuster to see what was out.""The Last Legion"" caught our eye and seemed right for our mood so we took a shot.While I winced at the references to ""the gods"" (at the time this film was ostensibly taking place - 432 A.D. - the Holy Church of Rome was well established) this film was still fun and shot beautifully. I felt like my eyeballs would pop at it's sumptuousness, as it looks that good on an HDTV.I'd give it two and a half stars if I could figure out how to get half a star to light up on Amazon's rating system.While it's no ""Troy - Director's Cut"", ""The Last Legion"" isn't wasted time."
2,what the heck?,"Well, this was a really interesting idea with lots of potential. Good actors, great settings, cool costumes and a neat story but this movie fails completely. The acting is rather stiff, the whole story is told far too quickly without a lot of detail, and you don't really care who wins, though I found myself rooting for the Goths. This would have been a fantastic movie done in the same way 20yrs ago but by todays standards the movie lacks a great deal."
4,Not What You Might Expect,"Action started out quickly and, I feel anyway, that the story was well told. Good level of suspense also. Good movie overall."
3,"Soylent Dick Says: A little dull, but a good story nontheless","There are probably two slight drawbacks to this movie: 1 - the action is at times a little dull, and 2 - it could have made more of the romance between the Roman officer and the female Indian warrior. Aishwarya Rai is a dish, and more could have been made of her.However, it is an entertaining story, and good fantasy and escapism. Some interesting links between the last roman emperor, and the future King Arthur. Not the greatest movie, but not bad."
4,Great Family Movie,Family adventure movie for children ages 11 and up. No nudity. Plenty of adventure. Great twist on a classic tale.
2,the last legion,I wasn't very impressed with this movie. It is very clean as with language. There is violence of course but even that isn't too bad. The story was okay but not that thrilling. THe acting wasn't that great either.
2,ONLY movie on DVD no EXTRAS,"FYIThis version of the movie on DVD, has only the movie.No EXTRAS.And has Audio in the original English and dubbed audio in Thai.(BOTH are 5.1 surround)Also has subtitles in both English and Thai"
5,Surprising!,"I would have never given this film a chance if it weren't for Colin Firth, but when I finally did catch it online, I was struck at how fantastic it was. The acting was superb, all-around, and the fighting was action-packed and exciting. Although there were some historical inaccuracies, those like me who are ignorant of these facts don't really notice or care. I also loved Colin's character, simply because it was so very refreshing to seem him in something new and different. I loved this movie, seen it three times now, and would not hesitate to see it again."
5,"A Kinder, Gentler Epic.","In this kinder, gentler version of Excaliber we see Colin Firth in an unfamiliar role of a warrior. He's really quite good. Rai is believable in her role too. The love between these two is sweet. Thomas Sangster is a star in the making. It was entertaining."
1,A Hideous Historical Action Movie,"I bought this movie when it first came out and , based on what I saw in the trailers, expected a great action movie. I was sorely disappointed.A weak plot that starts in Italy and wanders over to Britain, with no purpose other than to put another spin on the Arthur legend is the largest of this film's problems, but poor acting and a low budget don't help either. In fact, the ""Last Legion"" portrayed in this movie never number more than a dozen or so, and the final confrontation is far from epic as the cover would lead you to believe.For a much better take on a ""historical"" Arthur legend, I recommend the recent ""King Arthur"" movie with Clive Owen."
5,Knowledge to be faster,The best thing you can do before driving a real race car and also the explanations you're looking for after driving in a track if you haven't read it.
5,I have improved substantially my skills,"Although some physical concepts are not detailed of a way very scientist, they are explained of the suitable way to understand them. It is detailed and complete. It arrives at the bottom in all the subjects. I drive exclusively in simulators and I have improved substantially my skills, understanding many things that before I did of automatic form. In spite of not having the English as my first language, it is a book easy to read."
5,Great tire,"I have tried many other tires on the market. None of them compare to this. This will be my fourth rear and my second front tire of the road attacks. They grip awesome on wet roads and wear like iron. I am very hard on tires so it's worth paying a few extra $$$ to get a tire that gets twice the mileage. The tire actually saves money in the long run (less tire changes). Not so good in the snow, haha. But if your a four season rider i highly recommend the road attacks."
2,Disappointed,"I absolutely loved my RioVolt100. So I tried this one, after I dropped my other player.I read the reviews, and didn't believe customer support could be that bad. But they were hopeless. I asked about the features of the machine and may as well been asking about a model they didn't even manufacturer. I purchased it after giving up on technical support being able to list the features. I had to send it back.It will not to allow you to program tracks. Too bad.I highly recommend going with the iRiver 150, which costs less and has many more features.But I'm sure this is a fine player if it has the features you want. Look at the user guide online rather than relying on technical supports answers."
1,"piece of junk, waste of money","this is by far the worst mp3 cd player. Tried 5 REAL cds and none of them worked then wouldnt stop spinning after I hit stop. Wouldnt take burned cds either, had it for an hour and a half until i returned it Dont buy it"
1,Junk,"This player software has too many bugs. In addition to all the problems listed in negative comments on this site I can add that I found the reason why battery life is so short.One night I was absolutely astonished when the player started to play by itself !!! The CD was not spinning, power button could not stop it, and I had to take a battery out to make it shut up. It was bizarre! So, I guess, the player is using some energy even when it is off!?Now when I know I am not going to use it, I flip one battery. Batteries now last longer.Still, using this junk is too aggravating."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I bought this product for my 15 yr old son for Christmas and less than two weeks later it does not work. I would not even rate this product one star. When you push the play button it says ""door open"" even though the door is closed. My son has e-mailed the technical support for the company and had no results. We have called technical support numerous times and because of the high volume of calls (obviously others are having a problem with the product too), we are unable to get through. I am very disappointed and very dissatisfied with this product. Unfortunately according to the info received with the product, we can not return this product to Amazon, but have to deal with Riovolt itself. This is very disappointing. My son is very disappointed and I am out the money for this product."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this this CD player and have been trying to get in touch with their tech support ever since. This player doesn't. All I get is READ ERROR with anything but the most basic CDs. Don't even try an enhanced CD (which ones aren't nowadays?). I have not even ventured beyond retail CDs for this player. Some basic CDs even display garbage on the screen. If you try calling their tech support you get told to call back later due to high call volume. With products like this, it is no wonder. Their website provides firmware updates for the 100 and 250, but not the 150??? Steer clear of this product. ... poor product and service."
3,"beware of 'REFURBS """,upon receiving my sp150 found it defective after two weeks of flawless play- seller- who stated full factory warranty - now says sonicblue must repair it and they don't agreeI'm stuck but you don't need to be
2,I paid $100. I paid $100 too much.,"My RioVolt SP150 is a good MP3 player. That's basically all I use it for. I have it hooked up to my stereo so I can play my MP3 CD's, but I play my Audio CD's in the stereo itself.When I take the Volt on the road, it works fine, except the batteries I use only give me about eight hours of power. I wish I could buy a remote, but alas, Rio's website offers no such item. Nor does it offer any AC adapter.My advice, if you only have a hundred bucks, get a RioVolt. I would suggest buying a different model, like the SP350 (Which comes with a remote).But if you have a little more money, like $300, get an iPod."
1,"Poor quality, awful technical support","This player only worked for a couple of days after receiving it. Now when I press the play button the disc does not spin and it looks like there's a problem loading the firmware.Tried calling their technical support hotline for the last 2 days, must have called 10 times. Each time there is a recorded message telling me that they are too busy with other callers and asking me to try again another time.Bottom line - don't purchase this player."
1,Horrible,"I first brought this cd player yesterday I was a bit dissapointed with the features, and the LCD display. It worked the first day, but the second day all it started saying was READ ERROR, and it doesnt do anything else but that, I think Rio Cd players should be Recalled, before i brought this everyone that recently owned one told me they [foul up] as soon as you take it out of the package! so i decided to buy it at the store..., so i could take it right back if something went wrong, and ofcourse like everyone told me, it [stopped working] for NO reason at all, you could keep this thing in a nice cushioned box, and treat it perfectly and yet it STILL will break. it is ashamed that they sell things like that for that type of price..."
1,terrible; don't buy it!,"I bought this for my husband. He took a about a week trying to figure out how to work it. He tried getting some sort of customer service by phone or internet, with no results. Then the buttons started to go haywire. It ended up in the trash, despite the hundred or so dollars I paid for it. He really tried to make it work since it was a gift, but it just wasn't happening."
2,Where is the volume???,"Horrible volume control for any medium (cd, mp3...etc) that you listen to. The only way the volume is acceptable is if you intergrate the unit with a car playback kit. Then you are using the car stereo and not the RIO itself. I have to keep searching for a better MP3 player that uses CDs as a recording medium, this is NOT the one!"
2,depends on how much you paid and how you plan to use it,"I got this thing for $20 after $20 rebate (yet to come) at circuit city.Pros:1. Nice display. Displays the whole file name, not just 8 or so characters of it.2. nice backlight3. Buttons easy to use when driving (comparing to other plaeyers)4. Nice headset5. Nice sound.Cons:1. FF is way to slow, about 5 times the play speed - takes about 10 min to FF 50 min (sony's is about 10 times faster. Panasonic doens't have one at all (for mp3))2. Battery life is nowhere near 8hr.3. When connect or disconnect the power supply (car adapter) it shuts off even when the batteries are installed.4. Can only remmeber the last track, not the position in the track (very annoying when you listen to long mp3 files)5. Sometimes skips tracks. (Yes skips right to the middle of a next track)6. Sometimes get ""reading error""7. Starts playing automaticly when you install new batteries (useless feature.)"
2,not his best work,"i love superpitcher's rhythm and balanced minimalism, which i learned about from some of his tracks on the kompakt total collections, e.g., baby's on fire (kompakt total 4) and mushroom (kompakt total 5). (you can get those on amazon.de.) but insipid lyrics get in the way of good listening ... and i guess i'm not crazy about his voice, either."
2,What is this he copied Eek-a-Mouse!?!?!,Hey this album is good and I like it. The only problem is that the beats were copied from Eek-A-Mouse's Album Skidip! I dont know why Eek or The Roots Radics let this happened and having to artist use the same beats twice. This album would have been better if they had used orginal beats sorry Freddie stop copying other peoples beats!!!!
1,Brutal is funny?,"Some of these jokes border on insulting, othersare downright mean. Kids are precocious enoughwithout being taught it's good fun to ridicule, put downor take advantage of others (fat lady, baby, little sister, etc.)"
2,Not Humerous,"I bought this book for my nine year old nephew, and he had a hard time understanding a good portion of the jokes. A lot of them didn't even make sense to me."
2,Jokes okay.,"This book had a few good kid jokes, but most were the usual retreads. My 8 year old son carried it around the house for a few days reading the jokes to us, so he liked it. But he didn't think it was great. Just okay."
4,A thoughtful portrait of the failings of friendship,"Another great novel by Walker, complete with solid characters and clear descriptions of a place. In its exploration of a long time friendship between two couples, it asks when are we most ourselves and do we change or mearly become more of who we are and can we ever expect others to understand us. If you've ever wondered why you can't quite connect with old friends, read this."
2,After I got this scooter for the ridiculously exhorbitant price of . . .,"$999,599.00 (but it had free shipping), I went the whole route and bought a Stephen Hawkingesque speaking-voice synthesizer so I could scare the dog-tar out of the blue-hairs as I raced down the hospital corridors on my gold-plated scooter.Unfortunately, the first guy I scared was a UFC fighter who clown-stomped a mudhole in my assburger and kicked me into an ocean of pain."
3,Not so helpful...,"This book has many practice problems, but unfortunately provides no explanations for the correct answer. If it wasn't for my professors, there would be no way for me to learn anything about my mistakes other than I answered incorrectly."
5,good music for a good life,"this cd is one of the best cds, I've ever heard, is like to be in the jungle hearing a lot of sounds of nature, is crazy, but good good good , Its great, you have to buy it, I can't describe it, it is too much for me"
5,love it,"its very useful, i bought it for my recipe book. and this just divided all my section and makes it easy to find."
3,"Ok book, just don't buy hardback.","well. this entire book was one big thank you to all the people who work on the original series. he should have spend less time thanking and more time telling the interesting deals that trekkies reall care about. he also tried to put gene roddenberry in the best light possible, which was totally uncalled for."
4,An insightful look into the people behind Trek,"William Shatner tells readers about some of the ""behind the scenes"" action during the original series. From Nichelle Nichols' affair with creator Gene Roddenberry to Shatner's estrangement with James Doohan. A ""must read"" for all trekkers, trekists, and yes, even trekkies"
1,More fiction than fact.,"When I first read this book,I thought that it was entertaining,but then different cast members and employees stated that Mr Shatner had made up facts.The Star Trek TV show producers Herb Solow and Bob Justman stated that Bill Shatner had taken people out of stories and put himself in them when he wasn't at the studio at the time.George Takei stated that the famous ""Bill Shatner fighting the fire at the ST3 soundstage"" was a publicity stunt and the firefighters fought the blaze and not Shatner.In Bills book,he is the ""heroic firefighter""!More fiction than fact,I threw it away."
4,Fascinating details about everyone but Shatner,"Worth every penny - Chock full of fascinating details about all the backstage and front office folks, and some about the cast. Doesn't go into individual episodes much, and we actually don't hear all that much about Bill Shatner's Star Trek experience: it's more like Bill is the narrator for EVERYONE ELSE'S Star Trek memories. As a die-hard Shatner worshipper I was bummed about that; still, the book has enough juicy backstage scoop to be a really fun read."
3,Too much focus on the crew,"This was disappointing. I did enjoy it, but it could have been so much more.Shatner spends 90% of the time talking about the crew from the writers to set design to post-production. He sprinkles quotes from Nimoy throughout the book and to some extent another cast member here and there, but the focus is on the behind the scenes work and the relationship between the show and the studio. Probably for good political reasons, he doesn't share his own personal insights into the different cast members or his reaction to different episodes. You get stories sprinkled in, but they are not very deep or personal.As I said, I did enjoy it and don't regret buying it. I didn't know a lot of the behind the scenes history of Star Trek and it was interesting. I felt, though, that the cast members were really neglected throughout the work."
4,Star Trek fan,I really enjoyed the book. Lots of inside info about how the episodes were made. The history was very interesting and suprising! Shatner is extremely open and honest and funny. I love Star Trek and now when I watch the episodes I can remember what the actors said about the episodes and stuff that went on during production. I can't believe how short sighted the network was. Thank god we have 3 seasons of it.
4,...can't think of a title....,"William Shatner does his usual good job of gettng you involved in the story. He is funny and quirky-using Star Trek technobabble to describe waking up in the morning and first thinking about this book-I loved it. Some of the various stories here from other people involved I've heard before but he William Shatner doesn't draw it out word for word so it's diffferent enough in those instances when he does quote people that it's not boring and feeling re-hashed. I just can't believe at the end of the book, he talks with his cast mates and he didn't seem to have any idea until he wrote this book that he was revilved by some and mildly tolerated by others within the cast-I thought he had learned that at a convention from some fans in the bathroom. All in all, a great read-or audio read in this case. If you haven't read or heard this one b4 and you've only gotten Star Trek movie memories, this is a nice companion piece."
4,SHATNER REALLY CAN WRITE,"This book deals only with the television series, not the movies, but it is quite detailed and full of new revelations. Written with class and style, although with fun also, it gives a gerat portrait of the first 79 episodes of this monumental saga. Shatner now is an accomplished science-fiction writer, so I think if this book was written nowadays he would not need the help of a co-author like Crhris Kreski."
5,Love this book!,"I bought this for my little girl, and I absolutely love reading it. It's a sweet story with very colorful, cute pictures. I would highly recommend."
5,Adorable story,"This book is about a little piglet that has lost his mother. He goes around looking for her, encountering other animals along the way that invite the piglet to join them in some sort of activity. The piglet only wants her mama. When she finds her mama, they enjoy all of the activities together ending up taking a nap snuggled up together. This is an adorable book to read with your child. My 20 month old daughter, snuggles up beside me before bed while I read it to her."
1,creepy,"I was really creeped out by this book. It starts out with a little piglet who has lost his mother, a terrifying concept for a child. Yes, other children's books deal with this subject including one of my favorites ""Are You My Mother?"" but in that book the mother has gone off to look for food for her child; there is no such reasoning here. The creepiness begins on the piglet's encounter with a duck while he's looking for his mother - the duck (a stranger) wants to cuddle with him. This set off immediate alarm bells about messages I don't want to teach my child about strangers. The pig continues to encounter strangers who make offers that made me feel very uncomfortable for my child to be ok with. Unfortunately children don't learn from this book that strangers who make such offers AREN'T ok. Aside from cute pictures, I just don't get the redeeming value of this book."
3,Not a bad pick,"This is album is o.k. I kind of expected more though. When he was about to drop there was this big rukus, then when the album came out things got quiet."
1,Ultimately Disappointing,"Boring CD from start til finish. The only two memorable songs are ""Wild For The Night"" and ""Take It To The Streets (with Billy Lawrence)"". I'd recommend Billy Lawrence's album ""Paradise"" over this wack album. Not to mention that Rampage's album cover looks like he's peering through a latex condom."
3,Been looking for this CD for awhile now,"And I get the radio edit version, censored and all. Not happy.Going to have to start looking all over again for the real thing."
4,A f***in Classic!,"To those below that don't appreciate the subtle and funny way this CD is, they better get checked. Every track in here apart than being a neck breaker and have crazy good flows - the skits at the end of each track are freakin hilarious. Very well put together for a hip-hop artist create.An Underground Classic that very few know about. Get it."
2,"Quiet, Great Cooling, Cheap Fans","Cools HDD Great, Quiet (at first, then Squeals like a pig) looks good, nice aluminum fins, inexpensiveUpdate: the two replacement EVERCOOL FAN-EC5020M12CA 50mm Case Fans, work fantastic and are fairly quiet. I did have to use super glue to attach them to the cooler (worked great though). I didn't have the right length screws. The EVERCOOL HD-F117 Aluminum HDD Cooling Device was too loud for my purpose.The original Vantec fans started to squeal after less than 1 month, comes w/ cheap sleeve bearing fans, I just ordered 2 EVERCOOL FAN-EC5020M12CA 50mm Case Fans to replace them. I also ordered a EVERCOOL HD-F117 Aluminum HDD Cooling Device, this one states it has ball bearing fans. I will write a review on those after I receive them.I am using these on a bareWestern Digital Caviar Black 1 TB SATA II, 32 MB Cache, 7200 RPM, 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive WD10000LSRTL - RetailHDD used as an External eSATA DVR expander. See AVS Forum, 8300HD and External SATA - It Works!!"
2,Disappointed,Trite set up made it impossible to maintain interest. Though I love his Hardesty stuff this left me cold.
1,Buy as a last resort!!,"I have been buying these 250w ceramic heat emitters (pt-2048) and Wire-light (pt-2062) for the last 6 years. Every 5 to 6 months they burn out, usally with sparks and flames shooting from the top of the porclen socket for a brief moment."
1,"Nice design, good sound, fatal flaw","It's a nice unit - small, light and it sounds very good. Why, however, have a 1 GB unit that only allows 255 entries? Try as you might - once you hit 255 entries (folder names and filenames each count as an entry) you can not add another song no matter how much memory you have left. I have 256 meg left and my unit can not accept any more songs.Let's hope PNY comes up with a firmware fix.Customer Service for this unit does not exist - only a FAQ which does not address this issue."
5,The Perfect Answer,"This book provides a clever answer to the tooth fairy question. I am a kindergarten teacher and this book is a superb read aloud! It invites the reader to use expressive voices, making the book a fun experience for the listeners. I bought the book because my daughter's name is Elise, but was delighted with its content! This is an absolute must-have!"
4,"A quick, heartwrenching autobiography","I would call this a quick read, but definitely not a light one. How the author broke the cycle of abuse in her life with the help of the love of her dog, is inspiring. If you are a pet lover, you will totally understand her unconditional love of her dog and how the love of a pet can make you want better for yourself. It was interesting to see how Ms. Fowler would allow herself to be abused, but not ever allow her dog to be. The book explains well the psychology of an abused woman. I look forward to all her books."
4,oranges by john mc phee,"Wonderful book like all of Mc Phee's work. However, disappointing in that he did not cover the California orange industry to the same extent he gave Fla. Perhaps another book one day. JMK"
5,Perfect vacation reading,"A wonderful romp through the Florida citrus industry. The books starts on the right note, covering about 50 ways to eat oranges and about 10 ways to use their citric acid to clean things. My favorite idea was the Norwegian way to eat an orange: cut off the top, stick a cube of sugar inside and suck out the juice.From there, we visit orange groves, review 100 years of disastrous freezes, discuss techniques of grafting bud-stock to root-stock and, visit with the day labor (including 'snake-man' and other curious characters). The book ends with a day with a citrus tycoon.I read the whole thing while resting under a beach umbrella. It was the perfect book."
5,Unusually good quality for the price,Nice glasses. I shipped four to friends and kept two for my self. Good size for an appertif or digestif. Very good buy at the price.
2,Slow starting,"I started this video with high hopes of a focused presentation on techniques for AT suitable for a beginner. To be honest I actually fell asleep after the first hour with waves of boredom, then lethargy and finally deep sleep setting in. You need to be very positive about the presenters to see this as engaging in the least. William Hurt is extremely dull, offers little value and almost seems awkward when asked to help the presenter. Definitely not a good start to someone interested in learning more about AT as a beginner. The second hour is much more practical and useful so hang in there."
2,Lacking,I must admit that I watched the first 10 minutes and lost focus as to what was happening. Needed more interactive exposure.
1,Pretty Bad Year,"While Tori's music often conjures up emotions which many of us never new that we had, ""Pretty Good Years"" is a sick attempt at duplicating this wonderfullness. Stick to covering Tori in the privacy of your own home."
1,Someone needs her own material,"Okay, I understand the urge to worship Tori. I am one of her biggest fans. There is no little detail about her that I don't know. However, I feel that it is going overboard and clearly into the realm of pathetic to make an ENTIRE ALBUM that consists of a person singing Tori's songs. She sings them just fine, thanks, we don't need nor want any impersonators. If this artist is trying to break into the music business maybe she should, oh, I don't know, GET HER OWN SONGS AND IDENTITY. She does have a nice voice but honestly, she is missing the point of Tori's work, which is to discover your own personal spark and create your own magic, not leech of off someone else's. Sorry, try again."
1,"Give it up girl, you got nothing","I would have given this no stars, but the rating system doesn't allow for negative ratings. I don't know who this girl thinks she is, but she should do two things: learn how to sing properly and stay the hell away from Tori's songs. There's no reason for this CD being in existence, unless someone is hosting a party for drunken karaoke singers (is there any other kind?). The screeching vocals emanating from my speakers reminded me of a parrot being drowned in a bucket of soapy water and that's the kindest thing I can say. Just because you recorded a CD, doesn't mean you're talented."
2,Never good as Tori does,"The songs are very good but the interpretation is not... not good as Tori Amos can do. For true emotions and genuine interpretations, go buy Tori's albums now! But not this one! Sorry for the english, I usually speak french, but I love Tori so much!"
1,Jesus Christ!,This is a sad excuse for a musical tribute to one of the best artists out there. The lead vocalist sounds like Kate Bush being run over by a semi while the music itself is just as sad. Just listen to the real stuff. Nothing can match.
1,tcs_approved,"After going to the last Tori concert (12-3-02) I have decided to expand my collection of Tori everything. When I wandered past this I thought I'd give it a go. AHHHH!!! Help! My ears are BLEEDING! This is the most annoying thing I have ever heard. I've heard Cornflake Girl turned into elevator music, and it was a million times better than this. This chic is merely trying to capitalize on Tori's name. Doesn't she figure that if she had any talent at all that she wouldn't be doing COVERS of OTHER PEOPLE'S work? One star cuz I am 4ever true to Tori."
1,Wouldn't even give this to my worst enemy,"This is by far the biggest insult to Tori and her music that I have yet to encounter. Jemma has done nothing but butcher the songs of one of the most influential women rockers of our lifetimes, I am embarassed not only for her, but for Tori as well."
1,STOP COVERING TORI AMOS PLEASE!!!,"Some consider that Tori Amos is the Queen of Covers. At most of her shows, she plays a new cover in her own ""Tori"" way, and usually it works wonderfully. Maybe people covering HER should take a few lessons. This is dreadful. Absolutely awful. Horrible midi-sounding carbon copy fluff. This Jemma chick sounds bored out of her mind, and there's no emotion to the songs at all. I'd actually listen to that Cleopatra Records faux goth Tori tribute than this crap. If you're a Tori fan, please, don't subject yourself to this so-called ""tribute"". Just listen to the original songs by Tori Amos and forget this cd ever crossed your mind."
1,Can you get any worse?,This has got to be THE WORST tribute album I have ever come across in my life. It reminds me of Stars on 45 or something corny like that. Save you money on this one because it just is not worth it.
1,Ok,"THANK YOU for sound clips!!! This is one thing I love about technology. Holy Moly...I agree with the sentiment of ""Why""... I listened to the bit of Cornflake Girl (which wasn't That bad) and then Caught a Lite Sneeze which was pure agony. I'm also thankful for reviews. I will not be adding this to my collection. Amen."
3,Well written songs -- Tori can never be equaled,Some tribute albums work very well as a collection of respectable covers by various artists putting their own unique style into the already well written songs -- This one doesn't. One band with one singer trying much too hard to replicate the original songs does not do Tori justice -- but it is cheap and if nothing else it is still very well written music and it makes you think about Tori songs and would be good to have in case a tragedy occurs that missplaces all of your actual Tori music. Get it only if you have a couple of extra bucks lying around and already have all of Tori's real music.
1,This doesn't even deserve 1 star.,"Sorry! I bought this cd ""blind"" not knowing what to expect. I guess I was hoping that it would be various artists interpreting Tori Amos songs. Instead, it's some hack singer trying to re-create, note-for-note, what can never be recreated. What a waste of money - this one's going straight to the used CD outlet."
2,Buy Tori's original stuff - this is not worth it!,"I found this CD is a store here in Holland. It was cheap, so I decided to give it a go, together with the Kate Bush tribute this band did (no, it's not by various artists, it's a band, with a singer called Jemma Price). I only give this album two stars, because it lacks originality. The songs are still great, as they're Tori's, but I feel, if you do a cover, create an alternate version, something (completely) different from the original. This band stays so close to the original version - why bother buying this, then? And the vocals are, well, terrible at points! Some tracks sound like they've been recorded only once - false notes and all. This album may be cheap, but spend the extra few dollars to buy Under The Pink - that's value for money."
1,Eek,"Wow. I own almost all Tori b-sides and albums and when I ran into this CD a couple years back I was super excited to see another artist's take on Tori's songs. Now, I'm not obsessive about the music, I welcome and love reworks of originals. But this CD is painful to listen to. It is one thing to cover someone's songs and put your own spin on them (just look at Strange Little Girls for example) but this CD offers nothing original or even uniquely its own. All they are doing, ALL they offer is slower, more boring, whiney replicas of the originals. What bothers me is that the instrumentation is almost exactly the same as the originals and the vocalist does do anything ""new,"" she pretty much tries to sound as much like Tori as possible. I've heard more original reworkings of Tori Amos songs from Tori herself, and that's saying a lot for her."
1,"""The Waitress"" can sing? Isnt she dead?","I suspect that although Tori thought she killed the waitress, she has infact survived all these years and has been planning revenge. How? By making this horrible CD.This ""woman"".... whoever she is, must absolutely be planning a public appology to Tori Amos and her legion of angry fans who are slowly creeping at her door. And I must admit I do feel sorry for her, heck wouldnt you if you realized what a joke this name will go to on her next attempt to cover yet another female singer?I will stop now because I am being mean...... but that didn't stop HER.Perhaps Mr.Zebra and Jupiter will plot a little ""revenge"" on their own. (laughs evily)"
2,CAUTION - Thin Ice,"Jemma Price has a wonderful voice and she obviously loves Tori Amos, but this is not a CD for Tori fans. Some fans may find it interesting, but on the whole proabably will not like it. For being made and/or released this year, it is a poor collection of Tori's wide range of songs. To be a true tribute, I would expect a at least one Y Kant Tori Read song, a few songs from each album, and a rarity or b-side. This CD is definately good for people who like Tori's songs but are not looking to invest in all of her many albums. It is more a collection of early songs and not a tribute to the wonderful singer/songwriter that so many have adored for years."
4,what can say other than my students steal my copies.,"An enchanting book about almost nothing. My sixth grade students are willing to be caught reading this picture book. Silly, stupid humor at it's absolute best."
5,Makes Kids Want to Read,"Any book with the word DUMB in the title is bound to be a hit with 9 year olds. My students love the Dumb Bunny books because they are ""dumb"" and funny. I love to watch them laugh as they read the various titles."
4,"Pete, awesome as always","This is an awesome Shambles concert, I totally recommend this DVD, it's definitely a 5 star DVD. I have rated it 4 stars, however, because the DVD box came damaged, which does not affect on the DVD quality by any means, but, you know, I paid for a new item (supposedly in perfect conditions) and the box was damaged. As it's a minor mistake, I chose not to return it, only paid 3 or 4 bucks for it after all, but as this is a review I just thought it'd be good to let everyone know. Do not forget that the DVD is awesome, though!!"
4,Great Unit except for Earphones,"I read the reviews this afternoon, went to Costco to get the one with a free 30MB card and here I am. Here's the review after using it for 1 hour:Pros - Easy to use software - Great, Great Sound (see below though) - Great compact size - great feel - great value (129.99 with free 30mb card at costco) - excellent interface and controls on the unitCons - Headphones absolutely [horrible]. I am using an old pair of sonys I have that really show what this baby can do. RIO are hurting themselves by putting in these cheap headphones although ergonomically they feel great. It gives the first impression that the sounds is poor. I am lucky that I read a post on here about the cheap phones otherwise I would be taking it back due to lack of knowledgde.Anyway, overall, go out - get one - you'll love it.....come on baby !!"
2,Not recomended,I bought this primarily to use for running. The sound quality was nothing to brag about with the headphones provided. However when I used my old headphones I was very impressed with the sound. The FM reception is a joke but it's good enough to use in a gym that broadcasts the TV audio through FM. My big problem is that the unit will shut down or reboot itself in the middle of a workout. At first I thought maybe the battery was low or loose but replacing it didn't help. Customer service was useless so this unit is going back. It's a shame because the unit has all the features I want for a good price.
4,Static?,"I received this product as a contest prize from work and immediately tore the package open and started playing with it. I had previously been using a RIO One, with no problems, and was looking forward to see how Sonic Blue's products had improved.As with the Rio One the menu's are very easy to navigate through and give such easy explanation that I didn't have to read the manual. I did the Firmware update just because. The software has been easy to use and overall I've not had any problems. Since I ride a mountain bike, the plastic case and armband keep this product from getting a 5 star rating. I'm always apprehensive about it falling out of the armband, but the mishaps I've had don't ever affect it. Also, if you turn the backlight off the static on the tuner goes away."
4,ok for entry level use,"Got the Rio S30S @ costco for approx $79; came with an additionl 32 meg SDcard which gave a total of 96 meg of storage. loading the software didn't have the best of directions & honestly was confusing. although i loaded the rio music manager software & for whatever reason loaded up the annoying realplayer software, neither one is needed since windows media player is all you need to manage your music. putting tunes on the S30S is a snap with windows media player. sound quality is quite good; the included headphones are not comfortable; i can see getting a replacement pair of headphones very soon. the fm tuner, as other reviewers have noted, is extremely weak. i got the player for workouts @ the gym; for this purpose, it works quite well. overall this is a good value; given the ease of putting tunes on here, at this point, i see no reason to spend more $$$ by upgrading memory further."
3,If you need a replacement don't bother contacting RIO,The player works great but my external memory connection quickly failed. I've contacted RIO several times to get the issue resolved and am still awaiting a response. If you're looking for customer service don't even bother. This is by far the worst service department I've dealt with. I'd suggest buying this from a store that will replace it themselves should it break.
3,Be prepared to install Firmware updates...,"Reliabliity is bad but getting better with firmware updates. Bought unit in October and had intermittent USB connection problems and playback lockups. These problems got worse until unit finally died on Dec 30th while trying to upload files. Tech support is non-responsive at best, so it may be many months to resolve a replacement issue.Update on Feb 24: Finally got through to tech support, somewhere in India. They told me to download latest firmware and flash ROM...that worked - it unlocked the unit and I was able to use unit for several days before it locked up again. Downloaded newest version of firmware again to get unit working again. This firmware version addresses the lockup problem. At least SonicBlue is working on the problem..."
2,NOT FOR MOTORCYCLES,I bought this unit to use while riding long trips on my bike. Mistake. The unit speakers do not fit into the ear canal well enough to stay in place with a helmet on. The unit itself is not very well made. The plastic case isn't very strong and a short fall from by belt to the parking lot did it in. Battery cover won't fit properly and case separated. You would expect for [this much money]something a little more durable.
1,Nice concept poor directions/help/durability,It took a few weeks of trying to understand some guy from India on the phone to figure out that their software stinks. I then used Real One to download the music. That worked good for six months. Then the on/off switch decided to go off all the time. I would recommend another company. I got my brother a newer model and he hasn't figured out why he can't download onto it yet. It keeps telling him the there is no storage. He even went to an Ivy league school!
2,Too much work,"My brief affair with this player lasted about a week, then we broke up. I wasn't interested in a high maintenance relationship.It all started on the download. I couldn't get the software to install properly, and the single sheet of instructions provided was NOT helpful. ...The software seemed easy enough and I enjoyed the player for a while but was constantly readjusting the ear peices to get better sound. After a trip to the gym, I knew I'd take it back as the ear peices were awful.Perhaps this player would better suit a Mac user for an easier download, and perhaps the ear plugs could be replaced, but I wasn't ready to invest anymore in this bumpy ride..."
5,Works great !!,"I'm not sure about people that said its horrible... But this works fine. I use it to work out and lift weights. Sound quality it awesome and don't have any issues!Working with electronics my whole life, This unit is awesome and the people who said it's junk and sounds horrible are people who don't know how to use eletronics!"
4,Great for the price,With no experience with mp3 players I was surpisingly delighted with the Rio. I really just bought the Rio becasue it was the least expensive of all of the players( $60.00)but found that execept for more memory I couldn't ask for much more in an mp3 player. I love the shape which is great for use while exercising and I also find the sound quality to be superb. Although the radio is almost non-existent I didn't find that dissappointing becasue I bought the device for the purpose of listening to mp3's.-Overall: Very Satisfied
2,Definitely not what I expected,"The item is very nice, but it has given me a lot of trouble. The FM radio reception is terrible and the music keeps on pausing, jumping, very frequently. I contacted customer service, they said I should download a different program than the one included with the MP3 which is a hassle, it just sholdn't happen. After I downloaded the new program, the radio reception was exactly the same and even though the frequency of pauses and interruptions in the music was la lot lower, it didn't dissappear completely. It seem its not very good quality equipment, no for paying [this price]."
1,Crashes and Poor Reception,The sound quality drops off when running or even walking.It dropped off so badly that very often it would stop all together (crashes).The FM reception also needs improvement.
1,Product problems - don't buy,"I have bought two of these devices, and both have failed. They just stop working. Customer service is a disaster. It took me three days and conversations with three people for them to agree to replace one of my non-working players. Then, I got a call from a fourth person saying they had to charge me. Two other people didn't return my calls over two days, and in the end, it took me five days, conversations with six people, and a total of two hours to get the problem resolved, and even then, I still have to pay to get them to fix their non-working product. Avoid this company as poor product reliability combined with unhelpful time-consuming customer service is a disaster."
5,An Awesome Player,"I bought this after trying several others, and for me it's great. The interface software is excellent and easy to use. You can defintely get by only referring to the quick start guide, although an entire manual is on the CD.The sound is very good and the ear buds are very good too - I like the way they fit my ears. I primarily used this while lifting in the gym or doing some cario work, and they work out perfectly. For under $80.00, this is quite a bargain considering what else is out there.Very highly recommended!"
3,Be careful with the clip!!!,"I bought this mp3 player because I thought it was a small and convenient way for me to listen to music during my workouts. The software and interface all worked fine, nothing too fancy, but after about 3 weeks, the cheap plastic clip that it came with broke, so now I have to carry it if I want to use it, which makes it pretty much worthless during workouts. Also, they don't manufacture spare clips in case the original one breaks. Also, it uses up the required single AAA battery pretty quickly, so the batteries have to be replaced fairly often for such a small device."
5,I love it and you will to,I was shopping for mp3 players when the rio s30s caught my eye. Im one of the few mac users so this was perfect because it was mac compatible.When i plugged it into my computer and installed itunes i was already adding songs into it. For those of you who are a little behind on technology this is pretty straightforward.it has decent space to begin with but it is expandalbe.All you need is an MMC card or a SD card to increase the memory.To top this all off this thing is built like a tank! ive dropped a cuopple of times on stone tiles and it was fine. It could have easily ben made water proof but tkats fine.I highly suggest buying this mp3 player!
4,"Nice, just right for workouts!","I have read several reviews on this model and I agree with everyone that says the headphones are bad. I bought new ones for around $15.00 and the music sounds GREAT. It is small and great for running. The large button is easy to find when you are running for changing songs, whether it is located on your hip or arm. It was easy to understand the menu. Nice backlight for night use. Nice display. Software was user friendly and tranfers quick. Bought a 128mg memory card for $44.00 and now have more than enough memory with the 64mg that is in the unit. Saved $50.00 by not buying the s35s and put that money towards the 128 memory. Only fault I have found so far was the headphones"
1,Stay Away,"I purchased this MP3 player as my first one and I wish I hadn't. First off, the sound quality is horrible, I hear the backup vocals better than the lead vocals. I made every adjustment possible to equalizer but it still sounded like [that]. To make matter worse, the songs would pause themselves every 3 or 4 seconds. And finally, the FM reception is really, really bad. I definately would not recomend this player."
2,"Wrong CD, but OK.",Amazon sent me this CD which was listed as a Flip Wilson CD. Seems there was a juxtaposition of names. The music is good so I'll hold onto it.
5,EASY TO USE!!!!,I BOUGHT THE ELECTRODES IN BULK TO USE WITH MY INTELECT NMES FOR BACK SPASMS. THEY ARE EASY TO PLACE ON YOURSELF AND FOR THE MONEY AND THE RELIEF OF PAIN I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT THEM.
3,Great,It does what it says on the label can't rave about it to much.But for the price and the quantity it was a good buy.
4,"Still not as great as Sonora Carruseles, but good","If you want the heavy and yet eloquent salsa, La Salsa la Traigo Yo, Con Todos los Hierros, both by Sonora Carruseles are better albums. Bonilla is a great musician, and his non-romantic and non-cheesy salsa is the salsa I prefer. I love the rumba, the salsa brava type. This is what this album is.Sonora Carruseles, Fruko y Sus Tesos, and Edwin Bonilla... Buy their albums, their music are a cut above the rest."
5,Better Than Advertised!!,"If you have pets, the Dyson is a must have. The first time you use the Dyson, you will think your carpet was never vacuumed. It pulls dirt and pet hair up that other vacs leave behind. The first time we used it we had to empty it after a few minutes. My daughter had the same experience. This is one product that lives up to its advertisements. You really get what you pay for."
4,Good basic beginners book on Missouri archaeology.,This book was written by two of the pioneers of archaeology in Missouri. It contains simple but informative information on different phases of occupation within the state.
5,Great book,"This book is very informative, and if you are interested in American Indian history, this is a must have, lots of facts, that arent taught in school. Reieved fast, and as described."
2,For clas,"Semi interesting, better than anticipated. Required textbook for class. Best textbook purchased for this class. Wouldn't have read it on my own."
1,BEWARE: Doesn't work on Leopard,"I bought this software and it loaded perfectly on my intel macbookpro running leopard. It crashed when I tried to launch it, so i reloaded it. Same thing happened. Multiple queries to emedia tech support have yielded...nothing. My last request was for a refund. Wish I'd purchased through Amazon and not directly for them."
1,AN HONEST REVIEW,"I WILL BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE LATEST GUITAR PRO UPDATE FOR MAC AS IT RELATES TO MAC OSX 10.4 AND 10.5. DO NOT BUY IT. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY IT.1. WEIRD, IT FLUNKS THE MOST BASIC FUNCTION OF THE COMPUTER WORLD: YOU CAN'T BACK IT UP OR SAVE YOUR WORK. YOU CAN CREATE A NEW FILE BUT YOU CANNOT SAVE IT. THUS, ALL OF YOUR WORK IS GONE. I COULD NOT SAVE MY FILE IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. I LOST HOURS OF WORK.2. PROGRAM QUITS IF YOU TRY TO PLAY ANYTHING WITH THREE OR MORE TRACKS3. IN PLAY MODE, THE PROGRAM WILL ACTUALLY SKIP NOTES. THUS, THE NOTES YOU TYPE IN ARE NOT ACTUALLY PLAYED BACK.4. GUITAR PRO ICON WILL NOT GO TO THE MAC SIDE BAR IN OSX 10.5. BASICALLY, THE PROGRAM IS WORTHLESS FOR MAC UNLESS THE DO SOME MAJOR CHANGES.5. PROGRAM QUITS IF IT HAS TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING TOO COMPLICATED.6. UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT PROGRAM TO BUY."
1,The Software is So Complicated,"So complicated and confusing you can't use it. No manuel to read. No costomer support.The COmpany is in France somewhere. So, there is NO 1-800 number to call for help, well you can call the funny French number.Totally waste can't use"
3,Decent Composition & Editing - NO RECORDING capability,"I was disapointed to find that apparently you are unable to connect a midi instrument to the software to compose from the instrument. For me that is a huge drawback. On the upside, I find it easy and intuitive to compose and edit using the fretboard or keyboard tools provided with the software."
5,TRY IT,"This is a fantastic piece of software made just for guitarists. You do NOT need to know music notation. If you can find the Guitar Pro tab for a song and load it into Guitar Pro, it will make learning and practicing the song MUCH easier! It is not perfect software, however. The interface is not as polished or slick, as say Sibelius or Finale Allegro or Finale G7 (I've tried them), but does FAR more then they can for the guitar player (and at a lower price). For example, you can repeat sections of a song over and over at different speeds until you finally learn the part. It can even speed up sections incrementally to help you learn a part. You can see the tab and the correct rhythm in standard notation above. TRY IT. There's probably a demo!"
2,Be Aware,"I could not register this software because according to Guitar Pro, eMedia had cancelled the license. I have contacted eMedia and will post the outcome here. Also, I received GuitarPro 5.2 which is fine but somebody needs to get their act together."
5,Son uses it every day!,"My son's guitar teacher had to quit suddenly but had left him able to continue on his own. He had seen this at a friends house. I took his monthly lesson money and purchased it. He loves it. He is constantly writing music and altering songs that he wrote before. At seventeen, I couldn't have asked for a better program for him."
4,Guitar Pro-5,"I am enjoying how this program breaks down the different tracts of music, it helps in working with the rhythm guitarist in my band. However, there are a few drawbacks in that some of the sounds are a little flaky, and once you slow down a riff you cannot return it to normal speed. It would be a little better if the data base was a little larger to select from but all in all I am impressed. The only other problem I encountered was trying to upgrade to 5.2 via the internet. I get an error message and I never know for sure if the upgrade loaded or not."
3,"good, but...","guitar pro 5 is an awesome piece of software. i've had it for a little over 2 years now, and it's pretty easy to use and read once you get used to the controls and options that you have at your disposal.the realistic sound engine (RSE) is also noteworthy, especially when most guitar tablature programs can't get beyond using cheap-sounding, video game MIDI effects. it really puts your music into a new perspective no matter what genre you're playing.what i'm not too hot about GP5 is that it's $[...]. granted, everything comes with a price, but there are other tablature formats like powertab, http://www.powertab.net that you can get for free and do the same thing. i feel that guitar pro 5 is built mostly on nice features and hype more so than actual quality (i mean, powertab is FREE!).if you've got the $[...], go and buy guitar pro, but just make sure it's money well-spent."
3,"Good for historic insight, not so good for gaining wisdom","This book is a collection of opinions of an old Japanese guy. That's about it. He certainly doesn't make the impression of an enlightened person. Some of the opinions are pretty controversial for a western reader, and this is the strongest point of interest."
5,Timeless Wisdom,The wisdom contained in Bushido is not earth shaking but TIMELESS. I will read it over and over again. I would have a greatly improved life it I commited Bushido to memory.
3,Did not live up to expectations,Bushido: The Way of the Samurai (Square One Classics)Nothing to stir the soul here.
1,"Hmmmmmmm, think twice after reading htis book","This book is good, since its a Japanese author, however, what does he know about Bushido? Seriously, Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi, who was a Bushi himself is much more real and practical than any other."
4,Insight 2,The book arrived in standard time and in new condition. I haven't started reading it yet but I did take a peek and it seems to have what I was looking for.
4,La Vie en Rose,There is only one negative comment on this DVD.They did not put a subtitle on the song unlike the movie in the theater.
5,A Wonderful Surprise!,"I saw this movie on an Air France flight to Paris. I had heard of Edith Piaf but really didn't know who she was. This movie is a beautifully told story of a woman who we should all get to know. The acting, directing, cinematography and music are all captivating. Beautiful!"
5,Fascinating,"For a Francophile, music and movie lover, this was a fascinating film. I love biographies as well, and enjoyed trying to understand the French. Admittedly, this represents a rather narrow range of interests, but this is definitely a worthwhile movie."
5,Perfect,"The movie came exactly as how I expected it. No scratches, no skips, nothing. I'm very happy and it is a FANTASTIC film. I love Marion!"
4,Brilliant performance,"Marion Cotillard truly deserved the Oscar for her performance as Edith Piaf.Later in the movie this beautiful young actress was playing this decaying, aging singer, the makeup was remarkable. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the fact that it is in french with English subtitles was no problem and the beautiful songs were cleverly woven into the background soundtrack. I thoroughly recommend the movie to any fan of Edith Piaf's evocative singing, Terrific!!! Rod Lewis Perth, Australia"
3,"Great singing, not so interesting a character","The actress' performance was great, Depardieu stole all his scenes as usual, but I really did not find Piaf's life all that interesting or her very sympathetique in the end. These biopics are getting as tedious as reality TV."
3,I am in the minority,"This movie has a lot of rave reviews attached to it. I think perhaps it is for someone who already is familiar with Piaf, and only wants to see an artistic rendering of her life. I went into this knowing nothing much about Piaf other than she was the french Billie Holiday. So, i approached this movie with a blank slate. It was hard for me to complete this film because most of the movie is made up of a whiny street kid who is such a brat and so obnoxious that it is hard to stand her. When it flips back to her as an aging, heroin-addicted adult, it is even harder to tolerate her then. The constant whining and obnoxiousness just got to me, so I apologize. So, if you do not already want to like a story about Edith Piaf, approach with trepidation if you are looking to learn who this person was from scratch."
2,Incoherent.,"This was a film in search of an editor, which it never found. I hated the format. There was no flow with the insensible going back and forth. It made her story incomprehensible to anyone who is not familiar with her biography. It is hard to imagine that even as a young woman, she moved like an arthritic spider monkey. Perhaps the director wanted us to feel as befuddled by alcohol and drugs as Edith was for much of her adult life. It detracted from the music, and left me feeling hungover. Maybe that was the point, though I'd never watch it again. I know there are many who found this film to be magnificent. But then they probably think Amy Whino-house is a genus, too. I guess I've never had enough narcotics in my system to see their brilliance. I expected to understand why she was so loved, but came away empty-handed."
3,My two cents,"I really cannot expound upon the reviews that have preceeded, but I do feel the urge to comment, myself. The performances are wonderful, the filming excellent, but the movie as a whole is disjointed, leaving my friends and me with questions never answered and at times a bit confused. Perhaps it was meant to be this way. It, in our collective opinion, was well worth seeing once, but unless you are a die-hard Edith Piaf fan I would hesitate to collect a copy."
1,Wrong Product Sent!,"Was sent and charged for a DVD when I ordered a CD! Sellers website ImportCD is DOWN, and I am very frustrated in trying to return and get a refund! DON'T ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!"
2,Flashbacks!,"This could have been a great movie. Great acting and great cinematography. Unfortunately, the excessive use of flashbacks makes this movie choppy and confusing. It was as though the editor had just discovered flashbacks and wanted to use as many as possible. The movie was so depressing and the editing so poor that I found myself wishing that Edith would hurry up and die so that the movie would be over and I wouldn't have to see another flashback."
3,La Vie en Rose,I enjoyed the movie--I thought the actress did a great job (she did win the oscar)I also enjoy biographies
5,Best acting performance i've ever witnessed!,At first i taught that it was a docomentary because Marion Cotillard's performance is so good.This is acting at it's finest!I highly recomend this film!
5,Wow!,"I saw this movie while I was visiting in Quebec City....Extremely moving, the acting is gripping."
2,The performance is the movie,"I really thought I'd love this movie...but I almost gave it one star (I couldn't bear to, because of Marion Cotillard's amazing performance). My problem was that I found Piaf, as portrayed in this movie, to be completely unlikable and unsympathetic (yes, she had reasons for being like she was; no, it didn't make it more pleasant to watch). Because I found Piaf unlikeable, the movie dragged for me. In real life, would you actually want to spend 10 seconds in this person's company?"
4,Fabulous performance by an academy award winner,To be honest I knew nothing about Edith Piaf. I wanted to watch a movie where the female lead won an academy award for her role to try and determine for myself why she won. La Vie en Rose was tremendous! I enjoyed the movie very much and agree wholeheartedly that Marion Cotillard deserved this award. I found the life of Edith Piaf to be fascinating and can understand why the French revere her so. I have recommended this movie to many of my friends and look forward to viewing it again myself.
5,amazing,"My Mother often played the music of Edith Piaf as I was growing up. She talked about her tragic life and how she searched for, and did not find happiness. Watching this movie with my 86 year old Mom on Mother's day was extremely enjoyable and meaningful. The acting was first rate and we were enthralled throughout the whole movie....Amazing!Enjoy! Nicole"
1,Subtitles?,"Would you believe that a movie filmed in French, but sold in the U.S. through Amazon, would have French subtitles? Amazon said that this is OK and, since the description does not specify the subtitle language, their a-to-z guarantee does not apply. This isn't what I would have expected from the ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company""."
4,Piaf through rose colored glasses,La Vie en rose is a tour de force for Marion Cotillard who incarnates a vision of Edith Piaf as victim and heroine. Cotillard's performance may well become legendary for its precision and depth. My only critique is of the scenario which romantizes Piaf's life and leaves out some of the controversies which came with her rise to stardom.
1,One star is too generous!,"This is probaly the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing! I was dragged to this cinematic disaster by my father, who insisted it was going to be good, this however was not true. First of all it was French (what more do I have to say). Second of all this thing (I refuse to call this a movie) has subtitles the whole movie long which was very distracting. Plus this thing kept going from past to present making it very difficult to follow. The only thing I left the theatre with was the constant grading repetition of the name ""MARCEL!""DO NOT FORCE YOUR CHILDREN TO VIEW THIS MUDDLE OF A FILM!"
4,Magnifique!,"This is an amazing film. Young actress Marion Cotillard absolutely channels the persona, energy and spirit of the late Edith Piaf in a brave, memorable performance that will take your breath away. The film's narrative jumps around perhaps a little too much, but other than that, it's very effective and compelling storytelling. It's painful to watch a brilliant artist self-destruct, but Cotillard's performance is so good that it's worth the ride... even though, for the most part, that ride is long and dark."
5,Great film!,"Absolutely no problems with this slightly-used DVD. Highly recommend this DVD retailer, I've watched the film a few times and it's never even skipped or anything."
5,La Vie en Rose,"Unfortunately, life was very seldom ""en rose"" for Edith Piaf, and this movie portrays it very realistically, without trying to soften or embellish the truth."
4,Magnificent Destruction,"This unforgettable movie may delight you and frustrate you in equal measure. The story is told in a chaotic jumble of scenes that do not really fit together very well. Unless you are completely familiar with the biographical details of Edith Piaf's life, you will often not understand what is happening on screen. However, chances are you will be fascinated by what you see, and that is the most important thing.Marion Cotillard won many awards for her potrayal of Edith Piaf and she deserved them all. The portrait that she presents of the ""French Judy Garland"" will remain with you forever.If you are a fan of biopics then this should be a must-see. Very possibly, though, once you have viewed ""La Vie En Rose"" you may want to go out and read a book that will fill in the historical gaps that are to be found in the film. Then you will truly come to know the great Edith Piaf."
2,La Vie En Rose,"I am glad I watched this DVD and I certainly agree with the Academy's choice of Marion Cotillard for the Best Actress award, however, I cannot say I will watch the movie again. It was too disjointed, jumping from one stage of Edith Piaf's life to another. I believe the story of this phenomenal life could have been given better treatment."
1,Careful what you buy,"Be careful if you by the DVD; since the one I purchased did not play in the US. Amazon should indicate which region the DVD will play in; got my money back without a hassle, but still disappointed that I can't find a region 1 movie at a reasonable price"
5,Heartbreaking,"Incredible performance, moving and tragic story. I now understand why Piaf's voice was so wonderful, sad, haunting, but proud.I will watch over and over again."
4,The Little Sparrow,"Marion Cotillard won a well-deserved Oscar for her remarkable performance as French singer Édith Piaf (1915-63) - whose life was triumph and tragedy intertwined. Director Olivier Dahan sidesteps the usual biopic clichés by focusing on the heart and soul of this unique artist. The film's fragmented structure works better than expected. Highlighted by several Piaf classics, ""La Vie en Rose"" is a must-see."
2,Disappointed,"The movie is a collage of episodes of Edith's life, without chronology. It never succeeds in painting her life, which was full of drama, lost love, found hope, hardships, tears, and laughter. It bases it powers to mesmerize more on the make-up expertise lavished on Marion Cotillon than on Edith's life. The movie could have been an excellent one but the director missed the mark and substituted flashy bits and pieces for it. You are better served by a good book than by this DVD if you want to know more about Edith's life."
1,"Don't mention the war.....,","What a silly film. I think I blanked out when Piaf dies. Was that at the beginning or the end?If I had only one regret, it would be agreeing to see this piece of flim-flam.One star for the singing."
2,Addicts Don't Amuse Me,"Well, you can't deny she was a great popular singer. I certainly don't. Like Billy Holiday, she possessed that special voice, that sorrowful gaze, the special loneliness that made her art very appealing. When the life story is told, however, one is asked to sympathize with her as a person, not only as a singer. For me, this was difficult. I certainly recognize her personal despair, I have compassion, but finally I found her a torment to others and began to sympathize more with them than with her. Many have an infinite patience with these types of demanding, erratic geniuses, but I don't. Thank God she found people willing to put up with her. I would have fled. The movie seemed long because I felt restless as I watched her destroy everything around her."
4,Excellent - but shows contempt for non French speakers,"This was a wonderful movie, especially if you're a Piaf fan. But if you don't speak French well, read a good Piaf bio first. There are times when the songs fill in a key part of the story or key emotion, yet there is no translation whatsoever - it's as it you don't count if you don't know the song in French. For example, I had to explain to people the significance of ""Hymn to Love"" and ""No Regrets"". I'm sure a lot of English speakers don't understand the ending at all because the producers couldn't be bothered to translate the final song."
1,Caveat Emptor,"La Vie en Rose is one of the most unforgetable films one can view, and if you rent it from Netflix, it comes with English sub-titles. HOWEVER, since AMAZON does not advise buyers that they sell copies WITH NO ENGLISH SUB-TITLES, unless you've already seen the film, you have no idea what's being said. The buyer then has to go through additional expense returning the DVD and hopefully getting a refund.I think AMAZON should include information (no sub-titles) next to descriptions of foreign films they sell. After all, this is AMERICA, and most of us speak ENGLISH, not French."
5,This is a well made movie.,"I love Edith Piaf's music so it was nice to watch a movie about her life. The movie was well made, it accurately depicted the story of her life as I know it. What is really great about watching this movie with others who do not know of her, is Piaf's music is played through out it; this gives the viewer a greater understanding of her life."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Cotillard is fantastic and the makeup is exceptional (so the Oscars were deserved I guess) but the rest of La Vie En Rose leaves a lot to be desired: it's told out of sequence for no reason I can think of aside from a need to be different, which just ends up confusing the audience, secondary characters are discarded as the movie sees fit, and it clocks in at a looooong 149 minutes."
3,"Interesting, great performance, but choppy","The actress gives an amazing performance, but I am not so sure Piaf was likable as a person and the way she comes off as abrasive and arrogant and manic made me not warm to her at all.Some reviews have said parts are left out of the film, in the American version, and I can well believe it.I am also not sure why they kept inserting bit of her as an old woman with red hair who comes off as something as cadaverous as Elizabeth I in her old age.Dark, and memorable only for its valiant effort."
3,Review of the Titanic,"The movie which was made in the twenties is not too bad. Some parts of the movie are difficult to see. But,that's understandable considering when it was made. The movie gets a little bit boring at times. As for the documentary it is somewhat informative and it gives you a basic understanding about what happened that terrible night in 1912. However most of the documentary is made of parts from the movie. The entire package is almost in black and white. Overall it wasn't too good but it wasn't too bad either. It is adiquate if you want somthing just to kill time. I suggest if you want to see a really good Titanic movie see ""A Night To Remember"" and if you want to see a good documentary see A&E's four-part ""Titanic""."
4,Overall good performer,"Nice ear buds for the money. Build quality is good and they fit my ears well. I added foam covers which make these more comfortable and provide a more secure fit. To me, the sound quality is the first consideration while price is also a consideration.Pros:Crisp clean sound. Reasonable upper bass response, clean midrange for good vocals, extended highs. Good dynamic range, high efficiency. Can improve sound of MP3 recordings that lack 'sparkle.'Cons:Somewhat overly bright which may lead to fatigue especially at higher listening levels, slight coloration in the mid-treble range, not much lower bass response.For the money and comparing these to other--even more expensive--earbuds, while not perfect, these represent a good overall value."
3,Good sound,"So, after a good... 5 months, my headphones decided to die on me. They served me well in that 5 month span though. My roommates used to complain about the noise level when I used the ipod headphones, because they were cheap and didn't do anything. With these bad boys though, they couldn't hear squat. I am however disappointed that when I opened the package, the foam pads that would fit around the ear buds completely fell apart. It was like dust in the wind. Also, they took like a week or two of continuous use for me to break them in (for my ears to stop aching whenever I put them in). I do recommend these headphones, we had a good run."
5,Can't go wrong,These headphones are a big improvement over the standard earbuds. Needed something inexpensive that can handle heavy wear from kids and I can't imagine anything in this price range sounding better than these.
2,Wish I would have invested in something else.,I'm not happy with this product. The pads disintigrated the second I touched them and they are not very comfortable. The sound is fine though.
4,$4.99 for the headphones and $8.58 for shipping?,"These tiny little headphones are wrapped in a little plastic bag about 3"" x 1"". They were shipped in a HUGE box, about 12"" x 8"" x 4"". It was absolutely insane. You'd think that Target would use a shipping envelope for this item.The headphones sound good. Buy them in the store and avoid the outrageous shipping costs."
2,"arrived cracked, poorly packed!","Color not as white as pictured and there was writing (logo's) on item not showed in description, very disappointed!"
2,Water wiggler replacement,The preceision water wiggler I purchased quit woeking after about 80 days. I called the company that produced it and they were very helpfuland said they would replace it. I sent the defective one back but haven't received the replacement yet. I'm sure it will come soon. It worked perfectly when it was operating. Thanks Stan Moffitt
1,Flawed display,"I really wanted to have a favorable experience with this device. My daughter has one and seemed very pleased with it. As a geocacher, I was looking forward to using it on a trip to Colorado.Startup was excellent with no problems. After three weeks, however, the display became progressively weaker to the point of becoming unreadable. I tried replacing batteries with fresh ones, but the problem persisted. Fortunately I was able to return to Amazon for a full refund. No complaint there, at least!"
5,Great GPS unit!,"I have been using this unit for about a week now. In a word, it is awesome. It acts as a flash drive when connected via the included usb cable. You can access all the files stored on the unit in this way. Apparently, most gps units only have serial connections and must use proprietary software to upload files. (I am very happy that I don't have to deal with that on this unit.) Also, the geocaching points feature is very nice. I simply use the included software to convert my .gpx file to the .gs used by the unit. This lets you carry the coordinates, person who places the cache, last found, hint, etc info with you. I think the only thing missing is the ""description"" field. However, I don't know if any gps unit will show that field. In most cases, you don't need that field anyway. I have used the unit to log about 20 cache finds so far. In any case, I highly recommend this unit."
1,terrible technical support when you have a problem,"I bought a Roadmate for my car 3 years ago and loved it, so I bought the Explorist for hiking trips. Three years ago, when I had a problem with the Roadmate, I called technical support and the problem was resolved in 3 seconds. With the Explorist, I called technical support and the technician spoke with such a heavy Indian accent that I could not understand him and he could not understand me. After an hour or so on the phone, I gave up and called back two days later. Another technician with an equally heavy and incomprehensible Indian accent responded to my second call. I asked him if the Magellan technical support group was in India, and he laughed and said yes. (That was one of the few statements I understood.) After a long time, with lots of ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"" on both sides of the call, the problem was resolved, but it took forever and was extremely frustrating. I don't think I would buy another Magellan product after this experience."
1,Better Options Available,"I owned one of these and it failed after < 1 year off of extremely light use. The buttons would no longer respond unless you used a pencil to depress. As with any product there will be lemons. I only mention should this be a trend with this product. My real issue with the product is the 'awful' software. Making it work with Vista was maddening. My second complaint has to do with the menus / OS of the GPS. The interface is not intuitive and makes you not want to use. I am no GPS expert but I can say my Delorme Pn-20 is 10X the GPS of the Magellan and it includes complete topo and street maps with the cost of the device. Additionally, the pn-20 is very intuitive (basically you don't need the manual). The explorist is an older generation GPS. Pass on this device."
1,Buyer bewaRE,"I bought this thing for my father-in-law (whom I LOVE). When he opened it, he tried it immediately ... and it didn't work! OK, so I return it to Amazon, telling then it was broken. They charge me a reshelving fee! If you want this thing, don't order it from Amazon ... you might get my old broken one! Let's see if they publish this!"
3,Magellan Explorist 210,"Nice unit but I could not get the mapping to download. In all fairness, I don't know if it was my inexperience or a problem with my computer or the GPS unit. I sent it back. Amazon refunded my money with no fuss. I wound up buying a Magellan Explorist 300. I really like it. This was a better choice for my use hunting and hiking. No worry about downloads or expensive maps."
4,Great beginner GPSr,"I got this GPSr mainly for geocaching and love it! It does everything I need it to do and was relatively inexpensive. I have not tried using any software with it, just the maps that are pre loaded. It won't do well giving driving directions, but for my needs it has been great. It is very accurate and simple to use."
2,eXplorist 210,"This receiver would be acceptable except for the following: the interface connector is awkward to use, as well as the battery compartment access. The unit eats batteries like Popeye eats spinach. Even when the unit is turned off the batteries are rapidly consumed. The software is incredibly slow. Accessing track information, for example, typically requires about one minute (I've timed it several times), whereas other receivers retrieve this information almost instantly. The case with user controls is nicely designed which, unfortunately, does not compensate for the undesirable qualities of the unit. Beyond this receiver, Magellan's support is horrible. Magellan could improve its support by simply not offering it at all. That way, you wouldn't waste your time asking for help."
5,Excellant Product,Magellan eXplorist 210 Handheld GPS Unit is being used to identify the location of historical/archaeological locations. It has a great user interface and is easy to use.
4,Magellan eXplorist 210,"I am thrilled! It works great & is easy to manage. I use mine for geocaching and hiking and it is up to the task. I took away 1 star because the included software for mapping is pretty useless and requires an additional purchase to be of any good. The unit does include major roadways installed by default, so unless you are using this for street level navigation, it is sufficient. Regardless, the unit has sufficient memory for many POI, Route, and Geocache files and file transfer is pretty simple. For the price, it is a great deal!"
2,Pick a different GPS,"Big dissapointment.No power plug for a car cigarette lighter is available.Advertisement said it included software, the software was a teaser that had to be purchased by Christmas (the ad didn't say this).I am used to hand held electronics having a built in rechargeable battery. This one uses AA batteries. I could buy rechargeables, but would rather just get a new GPS.Pick a differnt modle."
1,GPS unit not working,Purchased as a gift -worked for a day - changed battery but still not working. Not sure if it is just a bad unit but will exchange and report about the replaced unit.
2,Boy I wish I had read these reviews first,"I bought mine at Costco on impulse and THEN I read the reviews here to see why this sucks. I agree with the bad reviews. The FM stinks, lots of static, the holder doesn't align with the buttons and the songs are played in the wrong order. I have a Nomad II but didn't want to spend the money on a SmartCard to get more songs on it and an arm band and... So I bought the S35S when I saw it starts with 128 had the arm band and was half the size. I kinda liked the headphones, they hold on to me nicely. The only reason I gave it 2 stars.Oh well back to the drawing board. It's going back. Save your money, I'm still reading, maybe I can find a better choice, this time."
2,It lasted 1 week...,I loved it while it was working. It has a lot of great user-friendly features. I received it in the mail and with in a week it would turn on and get stuck on the first screen. I couldn't even turn it off - I had to remove the battery. I will be getting a replacement and we will see how that one does. If it worked it would be a great product!
5,Could this be any easier???,"I was extremely concerned with the software issues when I first looked into this player. If you have ANY computer sense at all, you will have no problem with this device (at least for XP users). I was transfering music to the player within 15 minutes of putting the cd in the cd-rom drive. It really isn't anywhere close to as hard as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.As for the player itself.. Its very easy to use and has all the features I was looking for. The tuner worked pretty well and I didn't have any static problems (maybe I'm lucky). I like the compact size while the belt clip and armband are a huge plus (especially for working out). You never really know its there. One other feature I like is I can plug it into my car cd player (using a cable I already have) and play music that way too.The only drawback I have is the headset. They really are cheap.Overall I'd highly recommend this player to anyone especially for workouts."
4,No Driver problems here,"So I've noticed a large number of complaints about installing/configuring the drivers for Windows XP.Let's see, I installed the software, plugged in the device, and the driver was automatically found and installed. Yes I can see how that would be difficult.Anyway, yeah the radio is kind of pointless, but there's a reason why this is called an MP3 player, not a 'portable radio machine.'To store more songs, just turn the compression rate on your MP3s down a bit. The difference between 128 and 112 really isn't noticeable for the most part.Overall it's a great little unit, perfect for tucking into my pocket while riding my bike indoors."
2,8 Months and no longer working,"Actually, I love the Rios S35S MP3 player. It's lite, I can strap it around my arm and forget it's there, and it sounds great! However, after only 8 months of ownership and use, the button controls quietly stopped working ... can't skip through recordings, can't go to the menu, can't change the volume ... can only get it to play, and but not always. Warranty's short, and it's over, so I can't send it back. Called support and they said they could trade me a refurbished one for $79. I'm probably better off buying a new one, but if it's only going to last 8 months, why bother???"
4,"Small and durable, great for exercising","I have had it for 8 months now and ready to upgrade my memory a bit. While running, I have yanked the cord by mistake with my arm and the headphones have stayed on my ears while the player hit the pavement. This has happened a few times and it's still working. My 140 lb dog has chewed it, only thing that didn't make it was the battery cover. I'm very happy with it. Radio doesn't come in that great. My only complaint is that the cover for armband and waistband wear is difficult to get on and off the unit."
1,horrible,"i've had mine for less than a year, and within the first couple months it started to break. i've done nothing out of the ordinary with this player. it shuts off mid-use, it refuses to play certain songs already programmed (that worked when initially downloaded into the player), cuts off in the middle of half of the songs (which were complete when first downloaded into the player), and now thinks that half of the memory is used up when there are NO songs programmed into it! Oh, and the ""stop"" button stopped working and now i can't use any other function on the player or change any settings because it is also the ""down"" function on the menu."
3,"Not really a ""sport"" player","If you're just sitting around or doing something low intensity (like lifting weights), it's a great player. When I jog on the treadmill with it on my arm (at a moderate intensity), it stops playing mid-song and returns to the start of the playlist. It's not the file, since the point at which it stops in the playlist is never the same. I emailed customer support and was told to purchase the Cali player if I wanted a player that will work at a ""higher intensity"". If that's the case, then they shouldn't offer this as a sport player. I'm going to try putting it on my waist, hoping it will help. Also, the volume could stand to go higher; it's often difficult to hear over the clanging of plates or the music that my gym plays."
1,Poor attempt at a sports worthy mp3 player.,"I bought one at Costco, and ended up returning it (thanks to their excellent return policy). Here are my thoughts:1) It's pricey, and for the money the included headphones do not fit well, and fall off in sports activities.2) The battery life is very short.3) The clock/date resets when you change batteries!4) The controls are very easy to accidentally hit in sports activity.5) No crossfading of songs6) The FM radio is difficult to use, and has poor reception.And finally,7) It may look rugged, but despite the fact that it is even in a padded belt clip, falling just 3 feet onto a carpeted floor made it break. Not very good for sports, eh?In short, I cannot recommend this unit for it's intended purpose of a sports mp3 player.A"
1,Cheaply made,"The armband container is awful. The holes on it don't line up with the switches on the player. The on/off switch is pathetic. The battery cover is flimsy. The overall quality is very poor. My unit split along a seam for no apparent reason and became virtually unusable after only 4 months. A mp3 player designed as a ""sport"" model should be more robust than that. The whole concept is very poorly executed."
1,Poor engineering!!!,"I can't belive I spent money on this mp3 player. It constantly ""hangs-up"" and skips. Also, you can't save your equalizer settings. Every time you turn it off and turn it back on, you have to reset the equalizer. The sound quality is also very poor. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!!!"
1,A No Buyer,"I bought the rio sport and hated it. It always freezes up, resets at the slightest shock,is NOT waterproof, and cannot be outside in tempatures under 40 degrees! Besides that, the connection was not too great. It took 2 hours to set up on a dell dimension 8200 with a 2400mhz speed, and when it loaded finally, the screen read ""The selected action is not supported"". It is a ripoff"
2,Pauses or drops to menus non-stop,"Bought an S35S in Feb 03. Love the MP3, though radio reception is poor compared to other armband radios on the market I've used. The fancy display is a waste as you can't see it on your arm. Controls are not as good as the Nike. But, I went through 3 Nike's rather quickly - they didn't take to running and sweat so well. I use an armband 2 hours daily for running / exercise. The Rio headphones wire broke quick and I replaced it with a good set of waterproof kind. In July the MP# player started pausing by itself or dropping to the menu or even off. Rio customer assistance told me to update the firmware which I did - to no avail. Guess I'm out of luck again. Will someone please make a quality armband mp3/radio for running!"
1,Looks cool but doesn't do anything ...,"The product design of the piece is great. Perfect size perfect weight.-but-I got a disk error while trying to copy files. Since then, when I turn it on, the screen says ""upgrade"". That's it! No music, no radio, no nothing.Escpecially no support. I've tried to reach Sonic|Blue for the last 2 days. I either get, ""high volume of calls"" or both times I've actually gotten through I waited on hold for over a half hour without talking to 1 person.If you buy this product. Good luck and you're on your own!"
4,Great for MP3 - Lousy Radio Tuner,"I kind of waited around for the perfect size player that also offered radio. This appeared to meet the need. However, the radio tuner is non-existent indoors. Outside is better but if you are skating or running expect the signal to fade in and out as you change directions. As far as MP3 capability it is a terrific little device. You could not ask for anything easier to download from the pc. Point and click everything. Let's you know how close you are to capacity. If you can live without the radio portion buy this unit."
4,This is still a great MP3 player!,"This is my post-use review that I promised. I have used this player in the gym for about a month now and I still love it. It is very durable and it stays in place. Whether you are using the waistband clip or the armband, you can be confident that the player will be secure and stable during rigorous use. The sound quality is excellent. This is the quintessential MP3 player for the athlete."
1,"Great product, horrible customer service!","I wrote a review on this product some time back, with the highest rating. I would like to retract that rating for one single reason: Customer service is the worst I have EVER encountered for any product. I know I am not the first to have these thoughts regarding this company. I will not bore you with the details of my experiences, but I will tell you that I have reported them to the BBB, and have taken the time to write this review, in other words it is that bad. So bad, that I would not tell any of you to buy this product! With the competitive market out there I suggest buying another product that does not carry the Sonicblue name. Heed the warning now, trust me."
1,I should've read all the reviews first........,"Ugh! Got this as an xmas gift from my husband (I recommended this specific player) and boy was it a mistake! It worked for about 1 week (5 hours of play) and stopped ('USB Connected' screen wouldn't go away) - reloaded the firmware as the website suggests. Worked for a week and went back to the same problem. Tried replacing the battery - again worked for about 4 days. Now even replacing batteries doesn't help. I have an email to their customer support, but from what I've read in these other reviews, I'm probably not going to be too successful. I can only guess from reading the incredibly mixed reviews for this product that when you buy it, it's basically a crap shoot. Hope that if you do buy it, you'll end up being one of the people giving this product 5 stars! If not, you've just thrown 120 bucks away...."
2,Not What You Want,I have had nothing but trouble with my Rio Sport. First of all the internal memeory dosent really hold that many songs. You might get 33 songs on it and it will be full. I purchased another 128MB stick and that lets me get another 33 songs on it.I have gone through one battery after another it just eats them up. The power button has had a mind of its own and doesn't want to turn on sometimes and other times wont shut off. Then the internal memory just wont play on mine. I have 33 songs on it and it can only find the songs that I have on my memory stick and when I connect it to the software it shows full but no songs on there to delete. So I have an internal memory that is useless.Get a player that costs more and holds more songs because after you get the memory stick to add you will end up spending more and still end up with less music. The headphones that come with it are also worthless and uncomfortable so you will buy new ones of those also.
2,Radio is useless,"The Mp3's play ok, but I found that the backlight actually produces a buzzing noise with the radio. So when you are switching stations, the backlight comes on and you hear a high pitch buzzing sound until the light goes off. I guess that doesn't matter much since the RADIO DOESN'T PICK UP A SINGLE STATION unless you are stading outside in line of sight to a FM radio station antenna.The radio is totally useless in my gym. It won't even pick up the FM broadcast for the TV's in my gym. I'm seling mine. I should have listened to the other reviews that warned about the radio."
1,Rio S35S POOR QUALITY!,"I've owned 2 RIO S35S MP3 players in the past 12 months. Both of them started behaving poorly within one month of purchase. The first one would randomly restart itself from the beginning of the playlist, and would occasionally just stop playing altogether, even with new batteries. After 1 month, the 2nd one began locking up in the middle of music uploads from my PC. Eventually it just stopped functioning. DO NOT EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU EXPECT TO USE IT FOR LONGER THAN 6 MONTHS!"
3,Not bad ... but it doesn't have hold button!!,"The player itself is very good, ie, good sound, small size, upgradeable with MMC or SD cards, handy ... But there is something that really bothers me, it doesn't have a hold button! Whenever you put it in your pocket, in your hand or anywhere else you will easily (and accidentally) press the big round set that has the Play and so on. It's very frustrating to put it in your pocket and press the buttons with any minimal movement ..."
5,Fantastic mp3 player for working out!,"I have had my Rio S35S for a week now and it has exceeded my expectations. The software for managing and uploading the music in easy to use. The sound while not earth shattering is good for the quality of the headphones included. I was able to get 26 songs on the 128 MB internal memory with each song recorded at 128kb MP3 format. That is about 2 hours of listening. I will be purchasing more memory. The player itself is easy to use and works well in a gym environment - working out with weights, aerobics, etc. The radio reception inside a building is terrible and the armband needs to be larger."
5,Couldn't be happier,I was listening to my MP3s within 20 minutes of opening the packaging! (Everything loaded easy as pie on my Dell laptop with Windows 2K) Great step-by-step instructions. As advertised it is very lightweight and the ear pieces fit over your ear so they stay in place while working out. The armband is a great feature so you can keep your hands free. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!
5,Excellent,I have tried several types of portable MP3 players. This is by far the best. Using WMA format I was able to get about 65 songs on the player. Very durable. Also it is very user friendly. Very easy to transfer music to the player. Don't mess around with any other company.
1,Not Recommended,"I ordered this MP3 player a little over two weeks ago - and I am returning it today. I am an Industrial Engineer and my roommate is an Industrial Designer - and both of us agree that the plastic case that holds this player is one of the worst designs we have ever seen. I literally pulled off a fingernail trying to seperate the case from the player, not to mention that the buttons on the top of the player don't line up with the cutouts of the case, or that you can't dock with the USB cable unless you remove the player. I previously had an Apple IPod, but traded it for an MP3 player I could ""go running with."" Big mistake - I will definitely do my homework next time."
2,There are better choices,"As my third MP3 player, I chose carefully, looking for excellent features on my runs. Unfortunately, I chose poorly. The clip broke quickly, making the poor-fitting case a moot point. Rio will not replace the case or the clip and you cannot buy a replacement. The capacity is excellent with the option of adding more memory a real plus. Battery life was reasonable. Sadly, the played completely stopped working after a few months. In a world where many companies have difficult customer relations, Rio stands out from the crowd in being particularly unhelpful. Though this player had promise, there are better choices. (I will be looking at a different company's players this time.)"
1,Piece of Junk,"Unit constantly shuts itself off and loses tracks, even with a brand new battery. Doesn't fit in belt clip case provided by manufacturer. Comes with iTunes software, but isn't compatible with iTunes. And to add insult to injury, you can't return it to the store once you've opened it. You have to jump through hoops to return it directly to the manufacturer.In short, save your money, this thing isn't worth it. Either go all out and get the ipod or go with a great mp3 alternative--a Sony Net MD player."
2,Good Sound - Poorly built,"I purchased 2 of these believing that they would be great for working out (one was for my wife). They sound good and the software is easy to use.However - I would not buy this item again. The supplied sleeve to carry the player on your belt or in the supplied arm strap is not cut properly to access the buttons properly. The arm strap is not well designed to hold the player - the player will actually flip out with repeated arm movements(runners beware). Then, God forbid you drop the thing at all it will fall apart. It is not durable and the design creates situations where it will fall. I've had mine less than 6 months and have not used it very much. After it popped out of it's strap a couple of times, the unit began to separate at it's seem. There is no way for a consumer to attempt to put it back together properly. Too bad. I strongly advise against this item as a sports mp3 player - it is simply not durable at all."
1,a piece of plastic junk,"whatever you do, do not drop this piece of crap mp3 player, it will break on you. First time i did this was within the 30-day garuantee from the store i bought it in, but recently i dropped it again and it become totally busted for the second time. sport my ass this thing couldn't handle running. It would periodically reset itself while i was running. do not waste you money on this piece of junk."
1,Radio does not work,"While the unit itself has functioned well for me with digital audo, the FM player simply does not work! Well, ok it works if its a clear day and you are standing outside fairly close to the broadcast tower.You will be very disappointed if you try to use the FM player in the gym, no way in heck will you receive a radio station, not even the ones used by the gym (so you can receive the audio for watching TV while you workout)."
2,"Great player, but customer service is horrible!","I own two MP3 players from Sonicblue/Rio and generally have been very pleased with the quality of the product. Recently I changed computers and lost the software/device drivers for my MP3 players. I've tried customer service twice; both times I was on hold for more than half an hour and - when I finally reached them - the people were not helpful. I believe the company has outsourced all of its customer service functions offshore and drastically cut the number of people in this dept... so if you have any issues, you are out of luck!"
1,Horrible Customer Service- Don't buy,"This should be a great product- but stopped functioning after 2.5 weeks of normal use. The replacement process has been a nightmare- SonicBlue has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Long hold times, not doing what they are saying thay are doing, and the latest- they ""shipped"" my replacement UPS but ""forgot"" to get a tracking number. I don't expect to ever get a unit back- and at this point don't even want it..."
2,If you're looking for an mp3 with fm tuner you should pass!,The main reason I wanted this was because of the FM tuner. Its a great little mp3 player and very light and easy to use! But I have yet to hear one radio station that was not unbearably staticy. I'm very disappointed with it.
1,Poor Fit and Finish,"In short the player itself is pretty nice. However, the plastic holder that allows it to clip to your shorts, or the velcro armband, etc. is terrible. The buttons do not match up with cutouts in the case and make using them difficult if doing any kind of activity. I tried to work with the Rio customer support, but after three weeks their response was 1)Yes, the buttons do not line up 2)It does make it difficult to use 3)They are all like this 4)Buy a better case through a third party supplier. What a joke this is. Admitting to the customer that their product is not up to par, and then suggesting I go purchase somthing from another company. Sounds like Rio wouldn't even buy their own product. I would not reccomend anyone to purchase this product."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this last week looking for a rugged player. I read the reviews here and saw some people say it stunk some people said it was great. The first time i used it i was thrilled! And thought the nay-sayers were idiots. Well, after about 3 hours use it started to sound like an old walkman on low batteries. You know, ""I got one hand in my pooccckkkeeettt annddd thheee ottther one haling a taxi cab"". Not only that but whenever the volume was at 25 or higher it randomly pauses! Also, the casing is incredably cheap. Anyway, I took it back to bestbuy (where i got it) and but the Creative Labax muavo nx 128. So far, I highly recommened it over this product, even though you gotta pay more. and oh yeah, ALWAYS buy extended warrantines on ANY mp3 player :)"
4,"even in a fastly upgrading tech world, this holds it's own!","This player is great. if you are looking for a player to simply play music while running or traveling off somewhere, this is it. without the quibble of dealing with all those features or downloading problems with programs like itunes, this player can take an SD card right in the back and put as many songs as you want on it. if you need more, buy a bigger card (they only get cheaper as they make them bigger and bigger). this player will last a long time as a simple player that plays music/podcasts."
5,No complaints,"I know everyone has different experiences with different devices, so I can only share mine....I've owned this little gem for close to two years and had no problems. The buttons ARE a bit sensitive, but I can either lock the unit or move it to the other side of my body. Simple enough. The software seems easy enough for me to use. But most of all, I'd like to talk about durability. I have a lawn service and wear this while I'm mowing, etc. I use noise- cancelling earphones and the sound is AWESOME! But I've bumped the poor thing, had the display so covered with grass I couldn't read it, and it just keeps on working. For the low price, that's quite a value. I've added a 512 MB SD card so I have plenty of music loaded to avoid having to listen to ""re-runs"" throughout the day. And on a rechargeable NIMH battery, I get about 8 hours of cranked- up rock music. I can't say enough about this device. It's been a real ear and lifesaver!"
2,You can do better than this.,"After owning this product for about 2 months I feel I know it enough to write a fair review. I'm not too impressed with this MP3 player. This is the first one that I have ever bought and have found a few major things that I don't like about it. First the volume is not nearly loud enough. I'm listening to it in the gym and can hear outside noise even with volume at full on this thing. The plastic case that holds it does not fit the player. That means that the buttons on the thing are barely accesable. The radio part of it is garbage and can't really be used. It's like tuning into a distant AM station. I ditched the headphones immediately and can't tell you if they are good or not.Do yourself a favor and skip this one, wish I had. Oh yeah and if you buy something take a minute or two and write a quick review about it. It really helps people out."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had the Rio S35S for about a year, when for no reason it just stopped working while I was running. The ""USB connecting"" message comes on and it won't play any songs. The thing randomly started working again, only to stop again the next time I ran. Now the bottons won't work at all, and it intermittently stops and starts working for no reason. Overall this product is very unreliable, and having read other peoples' comments I'm not even going to waste my time calling the useless, non-English speaking Rio tech support. Don't waste your money!"
1,poor quality,"Worked great for a month, I got it for my dad as a christmas present. He walked to work with it every day. Then one day the ""increase volume"" quit working. I am still waiting to hear from Amazon to get a new replacement and if that does not work I will try my luck with Rio. I can hardly see it being a ""sport"" model if can't handle resting in a shirt pocket for a 20 minute walk every day."
1,Pricey for a bic lighter,"Basic functionality is adequate. It plays MP3 files. The bundled Rio software is garbage. I have not found a way to reorder the songs on the unit. The proprietary cable is a very stupid idea. It makes a very strange buzzing (although not thru the earphones thankfully) and the ""menu"" button has stopped functioning after only 6 months. I can't recommend this device at it's current price point. If it cost under $20 it might be a decent value."
4,"After initial frustration, very pleased with results","Pros: Great little unit for my morning workout. Lightweight, great sound, easy to attach to arm or waist, good volume control, easy change in song selection. Haven't used the radio too much because of the great clarity in downloaded music.Cons: Initial EXTREME frustration with software to get my Toshiba PS141U-01F3 Laptop (XP Windows version) to 'communicate' to the Rio S35S. I had to wait on the telephone and eventually talk to a customer service representative, (2 occassions totalling 2.5 hours) to walk me through the software updates and help me get it to work. The company definitely needs to improve instruction manual that is included in the packaging. It seems that others have had the same type problems as this. However, once the computer and unit were compatable, it has worked well.Would recommend this product. I will be purchasing the extra MMC card next."
3,If only it would behave!,"So...my husband bought me one of these when I started a new gym routine heavy in cardio and could not STAND trying to focus on the TVs. I LOVED it! It was small and easy to use, although we don't have the fastest computer and the software update last year made it a little harder to add songs.And then...a few weeks in...it just DIED! AHHHH!So...I figured it was just a dud...I know it can happen...or maybe I had done something to it accidently...so we got back on Amazon and grabbed up another one. I loaded it up and we headed for the gym.And then ...a few weeks later...it would stop the song every 5 seconds or so until I hit play. Over and over and over.It breaks my heart because the sound quality was great, it had more memory than I needed for a good couple of hours at the gym, but it just would not behave!Hope mine was just an exception...I do think I'll give Rio another try...but I'm going to have to grab another model...so sad..."
4,Great for the gym: sweat-proof with a good battery life,"I've used this Rio player at the gym for 3 times (1 hour session each) a week for over a year. It has endured sweat, water and a few drops on the floor with no problem. The battery life is good enough that I only have to change the battery every few weeks. The player can fit a good amount of songs on it so I don't have to change them out that often either. Yes, the holder is a bit cheesy but overall that shouldn't stop you from buying it. It's so small that you can put it in your pocket if the holder really bugs you. Great gadget!"
2,good player horrible service and clips,"I was really happy with how small and easy this is to use, but when the belt clip broke (easily) the customer service people told me I was out of luck because it wasn't a manufacturing defect. Without a clip it's not really a sport mp3 player, is it? Now I can't even get through to customer service to even try to buy a new clip. Luckily, it's small enough to fit in a pocket, but I don't recommed this because of the risk"
5,Softwar installation not a problem,"I was in the market for an MP3 player for my runs. Debated between this and the nike model with my only concern being the negative reviews for the rio software and windows XP. I got this and installed the software, drivers and transferred 34 tracks to the player in under 5 minutes. Absolutely no problems. Windows XP gives a warning that the software is not microsoft approved but it runs great."
1,Better hope nothing breaks cuz you'll be buying a new one,"Rio no longer supports this model and the Sports case is cheap and breaks easily. Once it breaks, you are out of luck because Rio only carries replacement parts for their newest models. Do yourself a favor and buy something dependable with good product support such as Ipod, Iriver, or CreativeLabs..Leave Rio alone."
2,RIO not good for me,I had an intel pocket concert which I thought was great. My car got stolen and that was the end of MP3 player #1. After doing research I purchased the Rio R35S. Sound quality was average (not as good as the older and discontinued Intel Pocket Concert). The Rio lasted a little over a year then many of the buttons stopped working. I used it in the gym to work out and was very careful with it. Was not durable for me. Maybe this was an isolated problem but it was enough to keep me away from Rio's for good. My third and current MP3 player is the IRiver 390T with 256mb. This player is great. Sound quality is great. The player is small and user friendly for most people. Based on my experience I would stay away from the RIO.
2,Don't Buy this,"I bought this rio player and within 2 months the belt clip broke. I have logged tickets,called and emailed Rio 6 times but no one will send me a new belt clip. This is a big pain if you like to use it for sports.Speaking of sports. If you want to put it into hold mode you have to navigate through like 10 menu's to get to it.Save up and buy an ipod this is junk."
2,Durability issues?,"I have had my Rio S35S for about 4 months and use it pretty much strictly for jogging. It holds anywhere from 15-22 songs, which is fine for me. I use a Mac, and I can't complain about how simple it is to get songs on and off with ease through iTunes.The first thing I noticed when I got this out of the package was how cheap it felt. Compared to my friends Nike player by Phillips, this seemed light and plasticy, rather than rubbery and solid. Whatever, it worked so who cares. Anyway, now four months later, it shuts off on me once and a while, and I have to give it a smack to start it up again. It could be because it has fallen once or twice while running, but as a ""sport"" model, it should be designed for a little jarring here and there. Anyway, I can sense this baby is on its last legs, so I'll be in the market for a new one - not another Rio! ..., they should build something a little more solid and it should last longer than 4 months!"
4,Important note before buying - iTunes support only for Mac,"This product is probably one of the best solid-state MP3 players out there, especially for the price. Though I would like to mention a few drawbacks that aren't readily evident.1. The package does not specify that the player only works with the Macintosh version of iTunes. I use iTunes on my PC as my jukebox software and was frustrated to find that I can only use Rio's proprietary software or Real's application to sync files to the player, both of which are mediocre applications.2. If you are intending on using the provided arm-band, you should know that the player has to be placed in a rubber cradle in order to be attached to the band. The cradle makes the player a bit more bulky and also makes it harder to press the buttons and makes it quite difficult to fit the USB cable into the socket."
1,Terrible product AND company,A friend of mine and I both bought this product. The radio does not work and the headphones slip out of your ears if you happen to sweat when you workout. My friend and I both use ours for running Once it started to rain and mine got wet and it started jumping from song to song and then just shut down. After it dried out it worked again but just recently I was running and it just died again.This time it keeps looking for the USB port and I cannot change the display or get it to work at all.My friends display is broken and it now looks like a creased line through the middle. She can no longer view the menu. She is in the process of working with customer service and it has been a total nightmare. She called and got an RMA number and sent it in with the RMA number. One week later she received it back in the mail with a note that she needs an RMA number!!This product only seems to last about 6 months and is definitely not for anyone active! I would NEVER buy from Rio again!
1,No USB 2 support and horrible support. Died after 5 months,I just spent an hour with a rep who could not deter from her script for 5 seconds. My player had not been used for 2 months. I went to use it an it would not get past the main screen. The CSR said I need a firmware upgrade. Why I don't know. After she realized my PC had USB 2.0 she said the players do not support USB 2.0. She suggested I use a friends computer to upload the new firmware and music. Yeah that is a great idea. How can they market this as new technology if it doesn't even support USB 2.0. She said they have no plans to support it now. No remedy for someone who recenlty bought a new PC either. What service. The last product I will ever buy from them. Hope they enjoy Bankruptsy. Its fitting!
3,"Who on earth is ""winterstone/Mike Heine???""","This person has obviously never owned this Rio S35, his review reads like the blurb from the Rio's packaging, yet he gushes on and on about it. Clicking on his link, I find that of his 190 reviews for Amazon, he dispenses nothing but 4 and 5 stars.This leads me to suspect that the guy gets paid to gush about whatever products by whomever is willing to pay him for his bogus reviews. Either that, or he's clairvoyant, and only buys things that he knows ahead of time he'll like. Last possibility: he is extremely easy to please and has very low standards.Me, I'm not going to pretend that I own this Rio S35 so I'll give it a 3 star rating just to keep it even. But I do wish Amazon would do a better job of screening out paid hacks like this, who seriously undermine the credibility of Amazon's users' comments section, which is one of their topmost features."
5,perfect,"fit perfect, easy to installed, 4 years plus i got with this kit in the rough roads in the island of Trinidad and Tobago,in a 1997 honda civic ek3"
5,Landlock: The good and bad points of the story and dub. ver.,Landlock Vol.1 has a good story line. A boy's father who is a windmaster and killed and the people who killed his father are after him. He is surprised to learn who his fathers killer is. It is definitely a video that will make you jump up and go buy the next volume! I gave it 5 stars because of the animation quality and story line. I wouldn't recommend buying the dubbed version. The voices dont really seem to fit the characters.
2,Missed the religion part...,"Cute story... However, it failed to mention in the description that it was a religious, ""let's thank God for the animals..."" book. Which is fine, just not what I was looking for."
1,Why wasn't it mentioned that this is a religious book?,"God is mentioned several times in this book. This is not what we teach in our house and so this book is inappropriate for us. I think that it really should have been mentioned in the description. I would not have purchased it, I feel I wasted my money."
3,meh not what i expected,OK it smells way more alcohol like than it used to. It only smells like cup cakes once its settled on your skin for like an hour and its faint. I am not happy with this product and am not buying the flavor ever again.
2,SHOWER CURTAIN RINGS ARE MORE LIKE HOOKS,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PRODUCT B/C THE WAY IT WAS ADVERTISED IT SEEMED THEY WOULD BE ACTUAL RINGS...HOWEVER, THEY ARE HOOKS, RATHER SMALL ONES AT THAT, SO THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR A MEDIUM SIZED SHOWER ROD...THEY WILL NOT STAY SECURE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CLASP/CLOSURE LIKE ACTUAL SHOWER CURTAIN RINGS DO. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT UNLESS SOMEONE HAS A VERY THIN SHOWER ROD."
3,A pleasant book by a (seeingly) pleasant guy,"Mel Blanc, best known as the voice of numerous animated characters ranging from Bugs Bunny to Woody Woodpecker, weighs in with a breeezy autobiography. The man loved his work and most of the folks around him (especially Jack Benny), but lets us know what a fellow's a little stinker, too.I was reading especially for recollections of his about 10 years as a recording artist, which he entirely neglects to cover, but there are certainly sufficient good stories to make the book a fun read."
3,I got what I paid for...,"Really, I bought this video for one reason: a personal favorite of mine had a cameo ( lasting about 1 minute ) in this production. However THAT minute made the purchase worthwhile. The movie itself was 'straight to video"" so, ""it is, what it is"".There is some recognizable talent in the film and they do all right with the material they are given. A slightly different take onthe old "" Jekyll and Hyde "" theme. It's not totally a waste but as I said before, I was in this to see Anais and SHE ROCKED!!!"
5,A unique experience to read Padre Pio's own words,"Although I have read several books about Padre Pio, reading his own words gave me insight into his personality and spirituality, which I have not found elsewhere. A truly memorable experience for anyone who is interested in the life and contributions of this new saint!"
3,"Good story, terrible print.","I'm reviewing the actual book of this instead of the story. I own a bit of manga as I write this review, but this had to be the worst print of a manga I have read.The quality of print seems to be fine. But the paper that's used is oddly thick as hell. Most manga I own from Dark Horse and Shonen Jump print on thinner paper that's easy to bend and flip. With this each page feels like there's 3 pages slapped together. What really bugged me about this is how you can't open pages too far or the middle will start to tear, which is a really huge inconvenience because some of the panels and is stuck inside the edge of the paper, forcing you to have to tear a bit at the inside of it.If you're really interested in picking up this series, I suggest against the pocket manga and go look into the GD-Rom instead at the Antarctic Press site. It's 30 dollars more but you would get this plus the rest of the series on a DVD to read it without fear of ripping anything."
5,Great digital camera,"I bought this used as a Christmas gift for my 18 year old son, it arrived quickly in great condition. My son is very pleased with this camera. Its a great starter camera for a young novice with a natural eye for photography."
4,"Great Image Quality, But SLOW","Simply put, this camera is a SOLID machine that offers excellent image quality as well as photographic control. Being an SLR, I never used the LCD screen to shoot, which makes it more like using a standard 35mm. Get the battery pack/grip. Without it, the consumption of batteries is tremendous. With it, I easily got 1000 shots before needing a recharge. My major gripe, and the reason I upgraded to a Canon EOS D60, is that it is SLOW. The buffer is inadequate and I always found myself waiting for it to empty to take another shot. Viewing the images on the LCD screen takes forever. And the top shutter speed of 1/650 second is not fast enough."
5,An Inspiring Digital Camera,"I have used the Olympus E-10 continually since 2001. I had owned three previous digital cameras by Olympus but the E-10 was the first model that completely satisfied me. I take photographs for business (technical publishing) and pleasure and mostly use my images in digital form, although I have made satisfying prints up to 16 x 20 inches. I find this camera easy and enjoyable to use and the image quality exceptional. Although newer Olympus high end models have more megapixels and interchangeable lenses, I have not envied them enough to upgrade.Like all high end digital cameras, the E-10 has a host of features that can be a little intimidating to learn. I felt the E-10 was worthy of the effort and I was inspired to design a publication to help other amateurs master the use of this camera. My E-10s are a continual source of enjoyment and I hope others will make the effort to master its use."
2,Sticky lid,"I picked up this mug as a free shipping filler item for less than four dollars. I kept checking to make sure the price was correct during my checkout process... it seemed low. For $4. I was even worried that the picture was wrong. But, everything turned out fine. I got the mug pictured, and it's worth about $4. I really haven't used it since the lid sticks. It's hard to open and close, every time. And, like someone else said, here, the lid is hard to drink from.Would not buy again, even for $4 to fill an order for free shipping."
2,Full of ranting and raving and little else.,"As an investment professional (and a CFA charterholder), I was eager to read a book that was supposed to ""cut-to-the-chase."" What it turned out to be was not much more than a holier-than-thou, self-righteous venting. Don't look here for the basics of investing or personal finance. It is just the author's platform for railing against everything he thinks is wrong in the investing world. There is nothing wrong with that - except that the author makes the same tired points over and over and over again. He would have you believe the he is the only financial professional who could help you. The actual material on investing is basic and could be found in a hundred different books on the market. Save your $$$ - literally!"
3,Some good information,"Certainly there is some good information here including some legal information about who is allowed to give insurance advice for a fee and discussions on Medicaid that could be adapted as a sales pitch for long term care insurance.On the other hand, he advocates market timing when the economy is ""broken"" as indicated by an inverted yield curve and reports from the Federal Reserve. What he suggests doing is gradually move equities that are owned into safer and safer securites as the market prices deteriorate; no evidence is given to how the suggestion would have worked even in past bear markets (I suspect it would have been useless). Highly unconvincing material."
4,Good Book,"Wasn't the book I picked out, don't why I got it but now I have it so I'll put it to use after I read Index Annuities and The Annuity Advisor, better books.Shepmcsc"
4,No Nonsense Finance,Great overview on important financial topics by Mr. Moody. He has a great web site as well. A very worthwhile read.
4,Good Book for beginning readers,"was a little too easy for him, but a good book! Will know better when ordering more books in the future."
5,Enjoyable and Imaginative!,"I love Arnold Lobel. He tends to always use animals to convey morals. Immediately because of the sweet illustrations of animals wearing clothes, kids are delighted. The stories are simple and make great short stories for kids right before they delve into more difficult chapter books. These stories show friendship, manners, respect for differences, and helpfulness. This book is filled with positive stories. The tales show cause and effect relationships or compare and contrast stories. It would be a great book to use in an author study of Arnold Lobel. I highly recommend this book in addition, to all of his great books!"
4,Almost as good as Frog and Toad,"This is a series of seven very silly, very short stories within one book, which is great if it's bedtime and you're like ""I can't read the whole book, but I'll read two of these"" or whatever. At first, I found them a little too repetitive and silly, but soon found that Lobel left plenty of room for a parent to embellish these stories with funny voices and sound effects (like the wind blowing, or the new feet pitter-patting). Once I figured that out, this became one of our favorite bedtime reads, with my daughter anticipating the next silly event and having loads of fun. The whole book is bracketed by a father mouse reading to his seven mouselets, which is a great way to signal to your kid that s/he's going to bed, too. Extremely sweet book with a neat nostalgic wallop."
5,mouse tales info,mouse tales is a good book. In the story there is a character named tall mouse and small mouse. It is a story about two friends. Also because I like books where each chapter is a new story. So if you want a book with friends try Mouse tales.
5,My first-grader won't stop reading it,"My daughter checked it out from the library and read it eight times in one weekend, including twice to her little sister. Neither one wanted to return it to the library, so they're getting a copy of their own from Santa. The story is about a father mouse who tells seven humorous bedtime stories to his seven sons. Mouse Tales is a perfect bedtime book: kids love the stories, all the little mice are asleep at the end, and it's a quick, easy read for tired grown-ups."
2,Mouse Tales by Arnold Lobel,"This isn't one story, but seven. One for every one of the papa mouse's sons as they lay in bed. They are but a few pages, and most all of them aren't very good. This book is best for those ages 2 or 3, through 8 or so."
3,I didn't read this book; it was a gift for someone else,"I know nothing about this book; my church had a gift drive for kids in a reading group and I selected, at random, a kid's name. The piece of paper on which the child's name was written gave his age and said he liked books about animals."
3,Low quality not as really shown and stockers are bad,"It looks way uglier and the stickers are not handy, they got cut ASA trying to use them."
3,Kinda Cheep Looking,"On the tank, from the street, this looks fine, but holding it in your hand it is somewhat thin and cheep feeling. My husband really liked it, but we both wonder just how long we will be able to use it before the logo is gone or it has ripped."
3,Stokes fan,"I am a Penelope J Stokes fan, I love her work and own every novel she ever wrote, and waiting on more, but this is my least favorite I would recommend all her others but this one was just so so, sorry but this story line just didn't feel like it came from her. I am awaiting her next and this one would never stop me from reading her works."
2,Disappointing,"A long time fan of Stoke's writing, Delta Belles proved to be a great disappointment in her style. I was accustomed to wholesome, generational stories that I could share and recommend to my friends. I cannot recommend this book."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Whatever they tell you, this is NOT A HARDBACK BOOK.....I ordered 2 different times (the second via an Amazon ""Customer Service"" person) - and both times received a paperback book. Never got to read it, as I was disappointed in delivery, and subsequently in the reviews I read here. Don't plan to read it at all."
1,Extremely disappoionted,"I have absolutely loved Penelope Stoke's first books. I thought I had a new ""favorite author"" but in Circle of Grace and Delta Belles she has gone over the edge for me. In Circle of Grace she hinted at the Lesbian lifestyle but in Delta Belles the closet door has flung wide open and she attempts to give respect and credibility to a lifestyle that God says He abhors. It's a real shame that she has choosen this course. I no longer consider her a Christian author and will not purchase any more of her books.N Clarke, Arkansas"
3,Delta Belles,"Thank you Penelope Stokes, for putting a lesbian character into the lives of straight woman of the 60s. This book is a feel good, quick read with a bit of religous lean. It is so wonderful to see a lesbian character added to the mix. Shame on the reviewers who say they will shun Penelope Stokes for including one of God's creatures in her work."
1,Last Penelope Stokes Book I will read,"I was VERY disappointed with this book. I have read several of Penelope Stokes' books and enjoyed them, so when this one came out I quickly suggested it for my book club. I am embarrassed beyond belief that I subjected my friends to this trash. The language was crude, the love stories steamy (and occasionally vulgar - it describes a character masturbating) not to mention her un-biblical view of homosexuality that she would have her readers believe is God's updated opinion on the subject. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I fear the damage it may cause to those who are not able to discern Truth from trickery."
2,Disappointed,I have always enjoyed Penelope Stokes writings but was very disappointed with Delta Belles. I considered her writings wholesome but I could not recommend this one to my dear friends because of her handling the lesbian issue. It is an unbiblical life style and am dissappointed that she has slipped into that type of writing. I hope that her next book will be more enjoyable.
1,Loss of a great author,"I purchased this book thinking it would be similar to Ms. Stokes previous books of which I have several. I'm not a ""prude"" but this is not the work of the ""Christian"" author I thought her to be. I understand now why the change in publishers for Ms. Stokes recent books. Word would never have published this book. I was disappointed that the book review from the publisher didn't contain something about the graphic content and subject matter. I never would have purchased it had I known it contained a washed-down version of Christian beliefs."
5,"An elegant, understated jewel of a book!","Having recently discovered Mr. McCormicks' books, I would recommend them very highly. Very nice translations from Irish to English, with the added benefit of the inclusion of the Irish verse and English translation. Mr. McCormick's books are well worth the search to find them."
5,A modern day Mozart?,"That is what one critic dubbed him. Heavily ideological, this man is a phenonenon for the age. Great works that span a diverse range of emotions, textures, and thought, he was worked with Philip Glass on a couple of occasions. Sidenote: he remarked that he once saw all his tracks in the color of yellow, and he didn't even like that hue all that much."
5,Richard D. James: A Genius Of Electronica,"I bought this excellent CD a long while ago, and I still love this album. Even though it falls short compared to his earlier works (ex. Selected Ambient Works 85-92), this frenzied fusion of ambient, drum n' bass, drill n' bass, and some hardcore techno elements make this album a must buy. But this album should be heard only by people who are accustomed to the Twin's sound, otherwise newbies might like it, but think, ""Good Lord, this is crazy!"" It's such a shame that A great country like America is bogged down by (in my opinion) foolish, pop-rap. Techno should get a much bigger recognition. It's about time people listened to more competent music."
3,Not essential,"Of all the Aphex Twin albums I've listened to this one - surprisingly - is one of the weakest. The ideas are all there and there are some cracking tunes, but he then proceeds to fart all over them with his incessant drill n' bass noise. Really infuriating. You end up wanting to twist his ear and say: ""Stop that at once!"""
2,bunch of hype,"Before purchasing this album, I went online to see peoples' overall reviews and it seemed pretty popular. I bought it and, within 5 minutes of merely browsing through the songs, I became very upset with myself for purchasing such a terrible CD. His songs lack a consistant beat; there are merely collections of assorted sounds."
1,Possibly the WORST CD I have ever heard,"It is amazing in its own sense, that such a terrible album be produced, then released and then praised by people who give 5 star reviews. I seriously believe that it must have been faster to programme and write the album than its whole actual play time. By no means even worth thinking about. People will argue that I dont 'get it' but its not hard to differentriate between talent and stupidity."
3,he's SLACKING!,"i love aphex twin -- he's really an ingenious ambient musician -- but frankly, i think this CD is one of his bad ones. I mean, what the hell -- to see this pooey album after experiencing such a wonderful piece of art as ""Selected Ambient Works Vol. II."" Sheesh that one; it was just, you've got to hear it...it can't be put to words. well, i guess it depends on what you like, because SAW is very quiet, yet very eerie and almost disturbing. I found a lot of the music on the RDJ album to have silly, trivial beats. If you want to see what AT is all about; don't buy this album. Get the ambient one. If you like more upbeat, what the critics like to call 'jungle,' go for it. I kind of like it, but it's definately not what I was expecting to hear from Aphex Twin, nor do i think it's representative of his true talent."
3,I really don't know how to think about it,I like techno and everything but this one was just too odd for me. Some of the tracks are very good but most sound like just noise. If you like different music I guess it's good. Personally I'd prefer something with more lyrics.
3,"Um, what happened to tracks 11-15?","On my copy of this ""album"" purchased direct from the Warp label, my CD has only the first ten tracks listed above giving me a grand running time of... 32 minutes? I'd hardly call that an album (considering that Autechre's EP7 lasts more than double that length), but it seems that you Americans get a few extra tracks for your money. The music's pretty trippy though so RDJ still earns three stars, but how a bout a slightly longer release is Britain next time, eh?"
5,Aphex Twins = Richard D. James,"This is one of those albums that creates its own atmosphere and identity. There is really no explanation of it. And like most good albums it may sound like crap the first few times you hear it. The Richard D. James album, despite Aphex twins identity as an ambient artist, is more of a drum & bass album fused into eccentric, deranged, and atmospheric melodies. And despite the very nice grooves, in this album Aphex Twin also shows a technical intelligence. I cant seriously think of any tunes on this album that I don't like. And stull like 4, peek, cornish acid, girl/boy are great. Milkman is cool. Yellow Calx is my favorite. I'm not really an Aphex Twin fan, but this one is just too good."
4,A Flavor that only grows better with time,"Richard D. James album is certainly the most differnt collection of songs yet. James seems a little impatient at times ... the songs a short -- and speed up and slow down and fire in sounds here and there with no particular symetry. Although there is a symetry. It takes many times listening to this CD before one can appreciate it. The best thing about it though is it doesn't get old real fast. It's ""old"" to begin with and gets more enjoyable as you get used to it. END"
4,4 and 1/2 stars.,"weird and wonderful stuff in the shiny metal of this disc. it's an electronic spazz-out tempered with lush ambient carpeting for your ears to walk on. at times it feels as if you are inside a musical pinball machine and brain is being used for the pinball. if lewis carroll had dreamed music instead of lunatic books it might have sounded like this. your aural center becomes the rabbitt hole, and it's fun falling down and down. definitely headphone music. doesn't work quite as well being tossed to you from speakers. yes, headphones required. and i recommend it."
1,What happened?,This cd was Aphex Twin's second worst move. (the other was GAK) The only 'good' track is 'yellow calx'. (that would be 2.5 / 5) I hope this will be the last bad cd of him.
2,unusual maybe....,"Could somebody please explain me all that hype about Aphex Twin! I like electronic music and I really do appreciate bands like Leftfield, Underworld, Talvin Singh and such but I could never understand what people like about Aphex Twins music!? Am I deaf to his musical stroke of genius or is this one of those 'Emperors-new-clothes-dynamics? Open to input. Youdiss@yahoo.com"
2,Way too Overrated.,"Everyone hails Aphex Twin and this album in particular, but after repeated listens, the only good song is ""Finger Bib"". ""Drukqs"" is a much better album, with a mix of drum-n-bass and delicate piano pieces.Get ""Drukqs"", not ""Richard D. James Album""."
3,way too overrated,"the sound of this cd is incredible. Aphex Twin made it off of his analog studio but where did he get this sound. If you read the back of squarepusher's ""Feed Me Weird Things"" Richard D. James gives him all the credit. I love this cd but i don't like the fact that all of his songs are under 4 minutes. He couldn't hack it. Here he is doing drum loops on an 808 through a filter bank while squarepusher has cruddy equiptment making the most out of it and doing 6 minute long drum solo's. Thats talent."
5,What a Great Way to start the Day,"I read this devotion every morning and what a great way to start my day! I have had the book for about 5 years, but since getting my kindle, I now have it on there. Kay Arthur is such a wonderful writer and speaker....You can relate to everything she says!"
5,Amazing devotional,This book is such a blessing! She has a true gift!Must get this book! It will bless you!Kay is amazing!
2,Bad audio,"Ok concert, blu ray video quality is good. Audio quality is nowhere near good. Eminem is a tool, but his music is pretty good."
2,really eminem?,He's lip syncing the whole time. terrible. everyone else in the show is actually rapping but em is lip syncing the whole time so he can dance. i didn't get the dvd to watch nsync.
2,Ainda no foi entregue,Gostaria de informar minha chateao pelo simples motivo de que o produto tinha previso de entrega no dia 29 de agosto 2011 e até hoje nao recebi o mesmo.
5,"Intimate, soft, beautifully crafted sound, flowing",This will be considered a master work of Australian music art - it has taken the best of Australian music over the last 10-15 yrs and interpreted it through the voice of mature and warm voice (in fact an aboriginal man who started his career over 40 years ago).
5,Great CD for both baby and parent!,"We was given this CD by a friend when we were expecting our first child. We loved the Song ""Last Night in Utero"". Now that our son is born, we play the CD on a daily basis. The songs are unique and fun for both baby and parent. We will continue to enjoy ""Good Morning Gus"" for years to come. I highly recommend this CD for all new parents. It makes a wonderful gift, too!"
2,Problems with both discs,"Would have gave this dvd 5 stars, it has awsome features, but on both discs when i go into video with supplements and play anything it starts skipping and audio starts skipping. Took back the first time and got another and it did it again and now im thinking its my player wich is a sony dvp s3000, maybe the player is old? maybe its the disc i dont know, but i have never had this happen before with any disc"
1,MISSING THE ONLY GOOD BEASTIE VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHERE IN GOD'S NAME ARE 'FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT' AND 'NO SLEEP 'TIL BROOKLYN'??????Frankly those are the only Beastie songs that don't make me want to hurl and without them this anthology is worth crap.
5,Big Beastie Boys Fan,This DVD you have to get in your collection.Best videos are Sure Shot and Root Down.
5,Nathanial Hornblower blows his horn. . . .,"And in the case of this DVD, he blows it loudly. This is the quintisential piece for any Beastie Boys collection. I don't really know where to begin singing praise for this disc. I guess I'll start with the basics: excellent commentary tracks, interesting remixes, comprehensive collection of all the Beastie Boys videos, and most importantly, Dolby 5.1 sound. This is one versatile disc. You can sit down and listen to Spike Jones wax over the shooting of the Sabotage video or simply listen to the disc as if it were a CD.I wish Spike Jones was a drinking buddy of mine!!!"
3,A neat yet flawed DVD collection,"This is a very feature-packed DVD that will keep you entertained for hours, but for some reason this anthology is missing their two videos (that I know of) from their first album Licensed To Ill, ""You Gotta Fight For Your Right To Party"" and ""No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn"". I'm sure the Beasties would like to just forget that everything from ""Ill""-era never happened (much like they did with their Sounds of Science compilation), but these are two videos that were a key factor in the popularity of the Beastie Boys and I can't in good conscience give it even 4 stars."
2,If you like MTV vids and remix beats...,Basically you get a good selection of videos that you could have seen in from 1989 to 1998 or so on MTV or VH1. There's other goofy camera things to look at while you listen to the same songs. Then you can listen to the same songs over and over again with a different beat. It's 2 discs and each disc runs normally about 30 minutes a piece. I guess it's worth the money if that's what you want but it's kind of boring after watching it once. I think the original beats with the original videos are the most entertaining. When I bought it I thought it would be longer or just better because of all the hyped up talk on here about it.
1,Where are the Licensed To Ill Songs?,"There is absolutely no reason for leaving ""Fight For Your Right"", ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"", ""Brass Monkey"" or other BB hits off this. What's next? A Prince anthology with nothing off ""Purple Rain""? A Madonna boxset that leaves out ""Like A Virgin""? Paul McCartney renouncing ""Yesterday""?Criterion does movie releases so well (OK they had to re-release ""Charade"" because the first version wasn't anamorphic) that one has to wonder what the heck happened here. It's insane to think someone actually approved the final version of this product - who cares about 45 different versions of ""Shadrach"" if the LTI songs are MIA? Get Solid Gold Hits instead - that CD/DVD set has the stuff that made the Beasties famous."
2,"Nice to have the videos available, but extravagent","Their music is great, the videos aren't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I listen to the b-boys quite a bit, but I don't find a video dvd to have much replay value."
1,A Moustache on the Mona Lisa,"In my opinion, these DVDs were ruined by the decision to censor their lyrics. While I don't need to hear every f**k and s**t, the generally poor methods of editing them out completely disrupt the flow of the music. Shame on Criterion and the Beastie Boys for choosing market share over freedom of expression."
4,A pretty decent Beastie release,"A while ago I started following the Beastie Boys pretty closely, going out and buying up all the cds I could, filling up with all sorts on inane Paul's Boutique knowledge and what not. Naturally a DVD collection of all the Beasties videos sounded great; they have had quite a versatile career in music with each album sounding completely different from the one that preceded. This aspect of the band's music combined with a DVD that would finally let me take advantage of some of the hyped DVD features not commonly found (alternate angles and soundtracks). Being able to look at parts of Sabotage, Hey Ladies, or Intergalactic that ended up on the cutting room floor combined with a different remix make this easy to watch over and over. My only gripe, the band commentary isn't nearly as interesting and you would anticipate. Nice animated menus, full of features."
1,Almost 48 hours!,"I bought this 12 days ago, received it 2 days ago. Tonight for no reason other then poor quality product, the thing stop producing sound out the left earbud. I switched headsets and same thing. Only way to get music from both sides is to pull out the RCA plus to the point it's almost in the socket, which easily falls out of course. So now I get to play the runaround game and try to get a new replacement or my money back."
3,"A good product, horrid headphones","I was excited to get my new Rio Mp3 player. It can hold a lot of songs for it's minimal cost. Also, it is very lightweight, fairly stylish, and the sound quality is good. Unlike many other players, this one takes no time at all to load the songs. It is really easy to figure out how to use it as well.My only three problems with this player are that:It runs through batteries in a couple hours, even though it comes with a rechargable battery, that seems to run out even faster. Also, the headphones really have been giving me a problem. They are impossible to get to stay in your ears, and they are vey uncomfortable...even painful. I tried working out with them and they fall out every 5 seconds. My third problem is that, I would prefer an MP3 player that can play cds as well, because now I have to switch from my mp3 player to my cd player to hear different songs. If you're buying an mp3 player for it's capabilities, just go get an mp3/cd player."
1,Pront to lockups. Won't support many cards.,I'm lucky if I can get it to download 50 meg without locking up. Only supporte 128 meg cards - NOT 256. Will NOT support Secure digital cards. Built like a plastic toy.Not happy. Am returning this piece of junk.
2,Great Device - LAME Software,"Having switched from the Creative Nomad IIC, I was spoiled by the really great music management software. The software supplied by Sonic Blue is amazingly bad, klunky, and amatuerish.1) You cannot sample the middle of a song from your library that you are considering moving to the device - you can only start from the begining.2) the interface is klugy - you have to move your mouse from one end of the screen to the other ALL the time.3) Large libraries are re-read by the software every time you move up in the directory hierarchy. That means that after I've selected file 'X' for transfer and move out of that album directory, the software has to re-catalog all 400 albums in my library, and I start again at the top of the list in the 'A' section - and thus have to scroll back down every time.4) I could go on and on, but I'll just pray I can find better software!!!"
1,Garbage should have bought an Ipod,"The Player though it has excellent reviews in my eyes is junk, this was a Christmas present for my son but it shuts off after a couple minutes of use. I have tried both the seller and RIO for some satisfaction but I have none thus far not goor customer service on eithers part. I should have just gone for the Ipod nano for my son."
2,On/Off switch problems with Rio S50,Had to send my S50 back for repair. The on/off switch was defective right out of the box. Called Technical support who gave me a RMA# and an address to send in the unit for replacement. I'll let you know how long it takes for the replacement to get back to me. Would not recommend this player.
5,Great!!,"Got this thing 20 min ago and I already got 32 songs on there and its working great, the FM radio seems to be workin pretty well, I can pick up about 7 stations which isn't the greatest but is decent, I would really suggest this mp3 player to anyone and am so far really enjoying it."
4,"Great size, great battery, holds tons of songs but...","This is a great MP# player in size, comfort, headphones, radio, battery power, and download speed. But now that I have seen the iPod software that enables organization of your songs by artist, genre, album, etc I am jealous. SonicBlue should design some software we can download to better manage songs once they are added to the device... once you put an MMC card in and have 200 songs on the device it takes forever to find them without better organization."
3,FM reception a problem,"After 4 days, I have returned my unit. It is fine in every way except the FM reception is horrible. I can only hear the station I want about half the time. I'm using the latest firmware (1.6). Otherwise, I have no complaints, but the lousy FM reception is a deal breaker for me."
4,Nice MP3 player...but don't buy for the radio,"Good: sturdy design, you can use standard AA or included rechargable batteries(life is EXCELLENT!), nice form factor (2""W,3""H,3/4""D, well designed case, tranfer time for 128mb on a standard USB is about four minutes.Bad: the radio reception is very weak, management software is average, MMC memory is more expensive than compact flash to upgradeConclusion: Buy this player if you want a well made player with capacity for 256mb. Do not base your purchase on the fact that it has a radio because you will never use it. I paid a premium compared to other 128 players, but would probably make the same choice today."
5,Great player,"I just got it and it already had the latest firmware (1.60)loaded. Software is easy to use and sounds great. After reading some of the reviews I was concerned about the radio reception but I bought it anyway because of it's size and because you can use 256MB SD cards. It picked up 5 of the 6 radio stations I listen to most often. Good enough for me since the tuner is just a plus, this is an MP3 player after all. I considered the Nomad IIc and the iRiver but I like the size and expandability of the RIO. Cost a little more but worth it."
3,It's OK,"The Guitar is OK, both sound and pickups. Some strings sometimes need to be retuned after I bend.What's more, one of the tone controls has crack on it when the guitar arrived."
2,I returned it,"Its cheap and it work at first. But the mounting ring does not have a stop pin. It keep sliding on the rail and mess up the zero. Not for guns with any recoil. And if you have a powerful rifle or a spring airgun, forget it."
1,not what expected,this rifle scope is a fine scope and it is not that i am displeased with it it is just that the scope is not a Winchester and is some no name scope titled just Riflescope.it came in a flimsy box and although the scope lens wasnt scratched the protective thing wasdont get this but definitely get the winchester somewhere else because its a great scope i just got screwed
3,Special Air Service,This book is a very primer for anyone researching the origins and history of the British SAS. US military officers would do well to study the information it contains concerning the Malayan Emergency and how to effectively deal with an insurgency.
1,This thing is junk!!,I bought this item for my 4 year old sons birthday after spending all morning puting this together after I put brand new D batterys in it I can't even get the car to go around the corners up to Doc-Oct or go around the stunt track I am very disappointed I also bought this when it wasn't on sale. We bought it early for my sons birthday now it is past the 30 day return policy now I am stuck with a big chunk of plastic that he will not play with. I would have giving it 0 stars but amazon won't let you do that so it has a 1 star for what I have know idea.
1,don't buy this!!,"This product is horrible! i have itunes but i bought this product so another member of my family could organize their music. Simply put, everything contradicts itself and the tutorial is not really a tutorial at all. Nothing is explained properly, and many functions require you to pay $60 to get an upgrade before you can use it (like retrieving the CD information...meaning you have to manually enter it all since this won't let you do it).This succeeded in frustrating me as i worked for hours trying to figure it out. Don't waste your time and simply don't buy it."
1,The Worst software You could ever buy!!!,"I purchased this product thinking I could encode my library of CD's. It is cumbersome to use, and it does not deliver what they promise. Do NOT waste your money in this product. There are shareware products that do a better job than this one.Like they say: It is all in the packaging, but the inside is worthless.My real rating is a BIG zero for this one."
1,What were they thinking?,"I have previously purchased two older editions of Magix and loved it for many of its features. So, I upgraded with the Magix MP3 Maker 10 Deluxe...to find out that one has no access to the CDDB when trying to retrieve info on a cd. That is HORRIBLE! The older editions included this. I without a doubt wasted $30. Shame on Magix. Very disappointed customer."
1,Don't waste your money,"A Microcenter employee recommended this product and it was a horrible experience. After struggling with it for hours I finally went on the web to find help and found these other reviews. Everything they say is true. The manual and tutorials are wastes of time. It's too late for me, but before you buy anything try Audacity, a free music editor and recording software -- shareware. It's everything that MPe Maker isn't."
1,Yikes - what a mess,"All I wanted to do was copy some CDs and move the sound to an MP3 machine. Could not get it to work. As a computer professional, it was especially frustrating and as a usually good shopper, even more irritating!"
3,"Nice set, but doesn't fit",This set of plug wires is NOT meant for a 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP... Please double and triple check the fitment with your vehicle before you purchase.
5,Man music was the bomb back then,This cd is off the hook ra j has so much talent on this cd and saw when he perform on all that when he sang let it go. he's has way more talent than these boy band out here today I really enjoy this cd then the new music cause new music is really crappright now back then we have way much much better music to offer times change now but we still could previously enjoy old school than new school mainfully i really stick with my old music more often this person knows how to make better music to make you feel good.
5,"""If you LOVE funk music, this CD's for you!!""","""This album should have went GOLD!!!""Everything You Want"" is a wonderful album. It shines Ray-J's creativity as a singer/producer and I hope writer.This young man has lots of talent and it is proven in his debut CD. If this CD didn't get enough recodnition in 1997 trust me, whenever his sophomore album is released everyone who didn't accept his music will eventually turn around from their ways. His music has paved the way for many new coming artist who have chosen not to use sampling in their music. Eventhough his music is very unusual and diffrent, I think he made a perfect decision by bringing the funk back."""
3,Not permanent,"I wanted to cover my gray hair (about 1/4 of my head) with this. It did work, but was not permanent - I mean, not at all. It looked good the first day, then got lighter and lighter and less and less purple. Most of it is now gone and I only dyed it a couple of weeks ago. I might use it again, but only with the understanding that I will need to redo it every week."
3,Too good to be true,"It is often said that if it seems too good to be true, it is. I was excited yet skeptical when I found a hair dye claiming to be a permanent purple ( or violet in this case). As it turns out the color is a little purple, but much closer to what I would call a burgundy or wine color, definitely not the same as the color pictured. It is on the VERY red end of the spectrum of purple. My hair has been bleached and colored many times, so this may have had an effect on the outcome. Although I am happy with how the color turnded out, I am skeptical that it is actually permanent and I will most likely not purchase this product again."
5,Astounding,"89 songs on five disks alone are worth the price. Add to that, a beautifully bound book with historical information, lyrics, photographs and you have got a historical document that is a folk music fan's delight. At the risk of sounding like a television barker, either the disks or the book are worth the price. Together, they are priceless. This is one of the most beautifully put together collections I have ever seen.Rebecca Kyle, December 2009"
3,Entertaining read,"This book is cute and has its charms. A little bit silly, but a quick entertaining read. Don't expect a deep plot or anything other than silly juvenile thoughts."
5,This was soo great!,"I ADORED this book, its definitely a favorite now. I just couldnt put it down! It was adorable and a quick easy read that makes you smile throughout, I would recommend it to anyone it was truly great!"
2,2.25 stars for a boring tween book,"This was a very teenager type book - probably for tweens.Conor was very rude and standoff-ish to Kirsten in the beginning but it was hard to understand why. Because Kirsten was friendly with Conor's one year younger brother, Sean?It seemed that all of the characters acted young and immature. It seems that is Conor and Kirsten were both starting college in the Fall, they'd act more mature.Conor does start doing little things to look out for Kirsten, but it was difficult for me to accept that she loves him at the end of the book?Just not a good book."
2,Is There an Editor in the House?,"Overwritten, confusing, and sloppily edited. Full of misspellings, omitted or duplicated words. RV owners are often confronted with an incomplete, generic owner's manual, which contradicts the separate component manuals to which it refers the owner. I was hoping this book would serve as a quick-start introduction to understanding and maintaining my diesel pusher motorhome, and make it easier to wade through these manuals. No such luck. Yes, the information is there, but the presentation is so amateurish that the book loses credibility. If you don't believe me, read the first sentence of the chapter on RV electrical systems. It's rare that an author can be redundant and contradictory at the same time, but Mr. Bunzer achieved it. I received this book as a gift, and it's still annoying."
4,Chris Mills impresses again,"I fell in love with Chris Mills album ""Living In the Aftermath"" and had to get his other album. This album, The Wall to Wall Sessions"" was another masterpiece. I am glad I own both Chris Mills albums. A great buy for true music fans."
3,Nice examples. Good for those with existing skills&tools.,"""Collectable"" ... Dust cover photo is a fine example of rustica. Good examples throughout, though the focus seems to be mostly on the Adirondack 'twig & bark' style ... more of a cliche genre than a hint as to what REALLY can be done with 'found' and 'distressed' materials.NOT a how-to book, but nice."
2,Not Mr. Keith's best material...,"I've been a Fly Ricky the Wine Taster fan for over a decade, and can say with great confidence this is not a Kool Keith masterpiece. Is it as disappointing as the Amazon review? I don't believe so. I find it a notch below Black Elvis, and a couple below Dr. Dooom. The production is much closer to Dooom, however.Credit must be given for ""I Don't Believe You."" But, this album seems to folow Keith's ""I'm gonna put out an album every couple a weeks just like No Limit"" mantra, and seems to suffer accordingly."
4,Better? Yes. The best? No,"I was very afraid to hear this album, since Black Elvis is not really what every Kool Keith fan would want again. I like this album better then Dr. Dooom, but not as good as Sex Style and Dr. Octagon. If you are a die hard fan like me, you definately like this album. Ok, the beats ain't as great as it was some time ago, but his lyrics are still the best (from east to west :-)) He curses more in the first track then on all the previous albums together and it seems that he is more mad at some rappers then before. That is what this album is about I guess. Dissing all the wack rappers, who shouldn't be famous.To all the real fans, buy it, IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY!Greetz, Geoffrey"
5,Keith Thornton takes control,"This is Kool Keith's Keith album. He takes control of the beats and steers them right into New York where he can shoot his priceless words dead-on-target.Everyone expects something different from what this album is--that was the point! Keith knew that people would listen to it and go ""I can't believe he's doing this"", but this is a Keith Thornton album. Doing what he does without all the costumes, his lyrics seem even more impressive without a theme. This proves that he doesn't have to rely on his wig and spaceship style. Keith's lyrics are as self-defacing and humorous as ever.In a way, it's also one of the funniest things he's done. The lyrics depict more reality while proving to be Kool-Keith-hilarious.Raw minimalism meets lyrical genius though simplicity. The man has a gift. Who else can say ""F**k You.... Muthaf**ka!"" as a chorus and make it more than well worth the time? Nobody!KEITH!"
1,"Keith, What are you doing?","First of all, I write this review as a HUGE Kool Keith fan. I own every one of his solo albums, and almost every collaboration he has worked on. THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL. Keith shows none of his trademark originality and style. The albums sounds like a bitter, drunken ramble about how much he hates other rappers and music execs. His rhymes are weak, and some of the choruses are almost painful to listen to. The beats sound like they were made on a child's beat box toy, and Keith's constant whining gets old FAST. What a disappointment. Keith's best work to date: a tie between Black Elvis and Masters of Illusion, with runners-up nod to Doc Oc. Spare yourself the headache and check one of those out instead."
2,Dissappointed,"I am one of the biggest Kool Keith fans around. But for one reason or another this album didn't move me. Nor was I feelin much of it except the track, ""I don't believe you"". Maybe it was the ryhme flow which to me had no kinda of ryhthem or ""soul"" in my book. Have no fear thou.....if ya aint got Keith's latest release MASTERS OF ILLUSION I suggest you get it! a underground classiac. Im tired of all those dre and puff-daddy #!$@ -riders. All in all all praise to Kool Keith and Masta Ace my two favorite artists. Sorry Keith this one only gets 2 stars keep bangin' dem out boy! peace Carl"
3,"Not Great, But Worth Getting","Everyone thinks that this album is wack, and it definitely isn't up to Keith's standards of greatness, but it ain't bad. I know a kid who had never heard Kool Keith, and I told him to check Keith out. Kid went out and bought this record and totally loves it, and its the first Keith he's ever heard! This proves that this album isn't for Diehard Keith Fans only. Being a diehard Keith fan myself, I can say that this is probably his worst album, but its still way, way better than 99% of the hip hop out there today."
5,"Works as expected, with extras","Quick Background:I have been using the Pharos GPS kit for the Dell Axim x3i. When I upgraded to an Axim x50v I wanted to continue using the GPS software, and Pharos offered this adapter that would work since the x50v has a compact flash slot.Pros:-Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Allowed me to use the kit I already owned.-Allows the GPS to work without being plugged into power. I am no longer tied to the car - I can walk/bike/whatever around with my GPS.-Includes an extension cable so I can stick the receiver on the windshield.Cons:-Not much room for improvement with an adapter, but do wish it were a little less expensive. I don't think adapters in general should cost more than $25."
3,Look into my eyes,"Sure fellas, we're getting sleepy. The joke is no good if you don't hold up your end of the bargain. First two tracks stand out, one somewhere in the middle as well is nice, but the whole album is a little weak, thin sounding at times, too much concept, not enough music. Electronics and guitar repetitions and variations. Usually a cup of tea drunk heartily, when steeped properly. But, the leaves must be prepared properly as well, and then the packaging should be appealing, and when I say tea I don't mean dried bits of fruit or odd plants and such, I mean tea, except when I mean roobois. NATOArts, really?"
5,I think the other reviewer is confused...,"I purchased this CF card for my Digital Rebel XT and it is a compact flash card NOT an SD memory card like the other reviewer is suggesting. I don't know why he/she thinks it's an SD card, it's not shaped like one at all!Any who, the card works well and I have not had any problems with it. I am able to get approximately 300-350 photos shooting at a pretty large format. If you don't need huge files, then you will be able to get more images out of this card. I would recommend any Kingston product, they are always reliable, inexpensive and that's all any of us really want out of a product right?"
1,I didn't get a what I ordered,I order a CF memory but I recieved a SD memory. This is a terrible mistake with Aamzon. I'm highly disaponted on this.
4,Mum's The Word,"Guy N. Smith is a workhorse of the horror genre, with dozens of books to his name.Each book is a written like an excellent B-grade horror flick. Mind candy to make you forget about the real world for a few minutes.He starts with a neat little idea, in this case two mummies brought to the UK from Egypt in the early part of the twentieth century are buried, and then unearthed in the 1980's along with the Amulet of Set when the father of a dysfunctional family decides to build a bomb shelter. Then he adds just the right amount of sex and violence to keep the pages turning.This book is a no-brainer for fans of the man, but fine for newcomers as well. But, I'd strongly recommend new readers start with his series Killer Crabs books, beginning with Night of the Crabs."
4,Very good player ...,"This is a great little player for [for the price]. The battery life is good, the sound quality is good, and its very easy to use with the computer. The only draw back is that there isn't a fast forward feature to skip through portions of a track--otherwise that its a great player for its price."
2,Nice but alot of technical difficulties,"I like this little thing but the play button went wack and turned into the fast forward button so i had to pop the plastic button thing out and touch the sensors it looks so weird. When i bought it i thought that 64mg would be enough memory but it wasnt i always had to delete my songs all the time just to get another song on it. But i love the software that comes with it, its so easy to use, but i reccomend that you bye something better."
5,This is GREAT!!!,"This is the best mp3 player I have ever had! The sound is terrific and it is very easy to figure out how to use! If you are looking for a mp3 player, you need to buy this one! You won't be sorry!"
2,memory's a joke -- don't believe the hype,"I'm a realy beginner with this stuff, so I bought this one, because it was cheap, or, ""affordable."" I thought seventy bucks was worth, as the package states, ""2 hours'"" worth of music. Well, this thing holds at best, an hour's worth, and that's if you save your files as WMA, not MP3, which are a lot bigger. It doesn't seem to recognize WAV files, only mp3s and WAM. So if you only have mp3s in your computer, you'll be lucky enough to fit eight or nine of them on here, which is certainly not two hours of music.I think it's a waste -- who the hecks wants to carry around ten songs around all day for seventy bucks, that's what cd players are for! -- and I'm going to sell this thing on ebay for as much as I can get and buy the ipod."
2,Horrible,I got this product just yesterday and only one earpiece works and the damn thing keeps on jumping like it's a cd. Don't waste your time or your money.
1,Junk,I bought the S10 about the second week of October. 2 weeks later I could only hear out of one earpiece. I sent it to be fixed 4 weeks later I still have not received a replacement and I just talked to the horrible tech support and they input my order wrong and I will not be receiving one for atleast another week. I don't even want it back now. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,this is horible,ok i first bought this and it broke with in 10 days so i returned it ok so i got a new one now i can't figure out how to put the music onto it the computer doesn't realise it's even there it's a piece of junk! ...
4,pretty good for what it is,"I got this as a gift for Christmas, and with just a little fussing, it was up and running with all the proper software installed in less than an hour, tops. I use a G4 Mac, and already had a few hundred songs loaded from my CDs into my computer, so choosing the 10-20 songs permitted memory-wise was my biggest problem. The sound is good, the weight is feather-like, and it's the size of a small cigarette pack (not the king size). No. it's not an iPod, but it's a helluva lot cheaper. I go to work, empty the Rio, refill it and listen to different songs on the way home. Get home, refill it with different songs for my commute to work. Not bad. My biggest complaint is trying to track down the memory expansion... The instructions are very vague about installing or even locating what kind of MMC I need... Otherwise, this is pretty good and reasonably priced."
3,Not the greatest.,"This mp3 player is nothing revolutionary by any standards. Once I got it, i was thrilled. It was everything I always wanted before I saw what else was out there. I have a large music collection, and the s10 did not meet the capacity to store my songs. But, for $80, it's actually a pretty nice piece of equiptment, despite its storage. On the brighter side, the menu's are a snap to navigate through, and it comes with three songs already in it. There really isn't anything bad about it, with the exception of the storage capacity. But, if you just want the ""best of"" songs, I would recommend it."
2,Bad design!,"My first MP3 player and I'm glad I got it free because I would have returned it. My biggest complaint is the power on/off button. The switch is recessed and it takes quite a bit of effort to turn the unit on and off. Long finger nails would help here. Also there is not an easy way to search/organize songs that I know of. Bookmarks don't really help. So if you plan to add additional memory, finding a song could prove to be a frustrating experience. On the good side, iTunes4 recognizes both the internal memory and the expanded 256MB SD memory after the firmware upgrade. Download speed is decent with USB. The included padded case is useful."
1,no customer support,I bought a RIO600. It never worked. I have been trying to resolve this problem for two months. ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!! BUYER BEWARE
2,"Rich in trivial details ,the book lacks depth on Lebanon","The research is thorough, but the reader is lost in trivial details. There is an effort by the author to clarify the ottoman role in the massacre. This comes across as a feeble apologist stand. In some chapters the book reads like a newspaper article."
5,Down in the Asylum,"John Edward Ames is an expert at using the New Orleans environment and the local Louisiana weather to add suspense to an already tense story. The ""Asylum"" takes off like a bullet out of the barrel of a saturday night special. And the character of Reno Sloan, a lawyer turned detective, fits the scenery like it was molded for him. The ""Asylum"" is a fine gumbo of hardboiled horror. I recommend it as a fast read."
3,not her best but still worth reading,i thoroughly enjoy all of picoults work however this novel seemed confuzing. The mention of Sam and Hadley early on throws the reader off and her limted knowledge of San Diego can make the book further less interesting. Although this book is certainly not Picoults best work it still is worth reading but needs some serious concentration.
3,"Good, but not her best!","I have read several of Picoult's novels. I realize this was her first one and I can say that she has gotten better through the years. It was a great book, however I was a little frustrated with writing style. I usually have no trouble following flashbacks but this was throughout the book and pretty irritating. The ending was also disappointing!"
2,Songs of the Humpback Whale,"This book was written in 1992 and was reissued after the author had other successful books. I found the book to be confusing, trite, thin story line, and mostly predictable. I can see why the book didn't sell well when it was first written. The story is about a man whose whole life is the study of humpback whales while ignoring his wife and daughter. His wife and daughter leave him and drive across the country to stay with a brother. The story relates the sad childhood of the wife and her brother. While away the wife falls in love with an apple farmer, the daughter falls in love with the farmer's helper, and the husband finds them with the brother. Daughter's boyfriend falls and dies and a sad ending for all. Not recommended."
2,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book,"I usually enjoy Jodi's books so much that I picked this one up without reading any reviews. That was a big mistake. I could not even finish it. It is very hard to really like any of the characters. It is written in a mixed up way. One chapter someone dies and in the next chapter that person is alive. I tried to find out what the impact was, but I had to give up. I just did not care enough."
3,A bit all over the place,"This book got my attention, at first. However, it started to get a bit fragmented in the narration. The 5 different perspectives didn't bother me as much as some of the book being told in reverse. While the life decisions are all personnel, I found myself routing for a different outcome. Interesting? Yes. Captive? Not so much."
2,Ok...,Its an ok book. Definitely not for everyone. Can be very boring at times. Took me a long time to get through. I definitely wouldn't read it again.
4,songs of the humpback whale,"this book is an excellent character study. i have just finished reading it and found it to be quite well done. written in five voices you get five different perspectives of the same events.. i noticed the with the changing of voices and chapters, the fonts changed as well so one could really tell the difference in who was speaking. interesting book. . an easy read, but definitely worth the time if you enjoy character studies..i orginally picked the book out for the unusual title.. and i am so glad that i did."
2,Not the best Picoult,"I have just started reading Jodi Picoult's novels...this is not my favorite. It jumped around too much for me (in time and from character to character perspectives). I also did not like Jane or Oliver, the main characters, I don't know why exactly, but I just did not. I loved her daughter, brother, and everyone else. That being said, it did keep me reading until the end of the novel."
3,Not one of her best,"Like many other readers, I found this book distracting. I did not like the fact that Rebecca told her story backwards and that we knew the end of the story at the beginning. When she first introduced Sam and Hadley, I wondered who in the heck they were. I am glad that this was not the first Jodi Picoult book that I read. I might have missed her later books which are fantastic. I am a big Jodi Picoult fan and I am glad that her story telling has improved since this one, her first novel."
3,Good - but not by favorite Picoult,"I did like thie book, but not as much as I love Picoult's other novels (my favorites were The Pact and Plain Truth). While I have loved books that tell stories from different points of view, switching off each chapter, for example (The Poisonwood Bible), the different viewpoints did not really work well in this book. The father's viewpoint continually disrupted the flow of the story with seemingly unrealted accounts of humpback whale studies, and Rebecca's view point when from end to beginning, while the others went from beginning to end. If I had liked the story enough, my first instinct would have been to re-read the book to actually understand it and keep track of all the characters and timing of events."
1,Very disappointing,"I rarely write reviews for books, but I felt compelled to write a review for this book, as it was so disappointing. I have only read one other book by Jodi (The Pact) which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, the same cannot be said for this book, in fact I felt cheated for even reading the book. I felt the style of the book, in that five characters told the story, contributed to a lack of depth in the characters. Consequently, I cared little for any of the characters and ended up skipping any chapter written by Oliver. Rebecca was the most interesting character and I actually felt some emotion during her story. The other characters and story lines were wooden and I was not at all engaged by the main characters pilgramage or emotional awakening. In summary, a very disappointing story, lacking depth and emotion and the style of the ""five voices"" provided a disjointed read."
3,Songs of the Humpback Whale:A Novel,"I have read several of her books and just didn't think it was as good as most of her others. The story was written in a strange manner that didn't seem to enhance the story. The theme is a universal theme, but her other books like NINTEEN SECONDS had the ability to pull you in and keep you there."
3,Not as spellbinding as some of her books.,I didn't find this book quite as captivating as other books she has written. The quality of the used paperback was exceptional. I would not be afraid to order more books from this source.
2,I am afraid this book did not appeal to me at all and I did not read more,I am afraid this book did not appeal to me and I only read the first few chapters before I put it aside. I doubt I will go back to it as I others to read
2,Ugh.....!!!!!,"Thankfully Songs of the Humpback Whale was NOT my first reading of Picoult.......had it been, I would have never read Plain Truth and Keeping Faith, which kept me spellbound. I had also read a couple of her other books, which I found tedious, but this one I am only reading to the end, because I refuse to lay any book aside without finishing it.I read fiction strictly for relaxation and recreation, and this book fails me in both areas. I don't mind a moderate amount of ""flash back"" but this book has the reader flipping as if on a trampoline.....many times not knowing who the characters are or WHERE they are. I would be hard put at any given time to recite the basic story line to someone.I never thought I would ""pan"" a book, but I'm afraid I just have :-( I have an author friend, who says she welcomes bad reviews as well as good ones, so I hope Ms Picoult feels the same.Charlie Hall, editor of Just a Word"
2,Not what I expect from Jodi Picoult,"I expected a lot from this book as I have read several other books by Jodi Picoult but I was disappointed. It took me a long time to get interested in the characters and then, once I did, I didn't like many of them very much. I struggled to even finish reading it once I realized how it would inevitably end. Definitely not my favorite novel of Picoult's, who I actually admire very much."
2,Didn't grab me,"This book failed to grab me and I couldn't finish it. The premise of the different view points was interesting, but I din't hear distinct styles for all these protagonists, it was like they all spoke with one voice. I also got confused as to who was who in relation to the other characters, had to go back lots of times. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I am an avid fan of Jodi Piccoult. I have read most of her books and find myself getting through them quickly, with little desire to put them down. I must express my disappointment with The Songs of the Humpback Whale. Although there are aspects of the books that I do like, it has been a challenge to get through. In fact I finally gave up about three-quarters of the way through and moved on to a new book. I kept thinking that it would grab me at some point and keep me intrigued, but it did not. I will continue to read Jodi Piccoult...I guess all authors have one book that is not a favorite of readers - this is mine."
3,Disappointed,"I was very excited to read this book, having loved most of her others. I was rather disappointed: I did not like that Rebecca told her story backward; it gave too much away and made the story hard to follow in parts. I was disappointed in the end also, if you find the love of your life why would you leave. I know there were other factors at work, and maybe it was her past history of abuse, but why go back to an unhappy marriage? I am glad that this was not the first Picoult book I read, if it was, I would have missed out on the others."
