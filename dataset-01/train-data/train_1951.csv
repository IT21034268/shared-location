4,First try it in a store,"It is cheaper on amazon, but first test this bag in a store, this kind of stuff is very subjective and you don't know that it is going to suit you or not until and unless you try it first. I might like its fitting but may not suit you as everybody is different, so visit a store and try this out with some sandbags.The built of the bag is really solid, enough space for three days of outdoor activity, all the straps are very easy to tighten, overall built is very good, I just wish it had more pockets."
4,Very nice pack,Have not used this pack yet but have used other high sierra packs. Their packs are very high quality and very comfortable. The only complaint that I have is that there aren't many external pockets. Other than that its a great pack.
3,Pack need better description,"I purchased the pack as a extended weekend pack for my 19 year old son. He is 6'0"" and weighs 220 lbs. This pack is listed as a 55 Liter pack. It is. It is well made and I will keep it for my wife. When he took it out of the box he tried it on. I looked at the packing materials. It is listed as a slim fit. It is for women and kids. It has a max waist of 32"". This is not in the description. I wanted a full sized internal frame pack for him. The brochure that came with the pack clearly shows it as slim fit and lists the proportions. The ad does not. It would be great for youth and women, but I do not feel it is a good fit for adults. It is a good weekend pack and I am keeping it for my wife. The ad needs to show the brochure which clearly show High Sierra packs and who they fit and size."
3,Fair - for the price,"I bought this pack as a ""stand-in"" for a last-minute 50km weekend trip I just made, and in the longer term for my boys to use. Thus the range of torso size adjustment, durability and price were all important factors for me.This pack is reasonably well constructed of what appears to be sturdy materials. The shoulder harness adjustment mechanism (a velcro tab that wraps around loops spaced along the pack spine) is not the greatest - it's a little too loose, which means I ended up compensating by tightening the shoulder straps a little more than I'd like. (And perhaps it's just my pack but the harness squeaks as you walk along!) However, considering the price this is a reasonable compromise."
2,So much potential!,"I love South Park and I really hoped that this game would do the show justice, but I found that I was very disappointed with the graphics and the sound. I was hoping to see the boys in action, but all I saw was one of their arms that was supposed to be an extension of me. I also agree with the other reviewer that had trouble with the white on white setting. It can also be a little tough for people who are prone to motion sickness. South Park 2 ..please!"
2,"A party rental, at best","Plodding first-person shooter with tons of fog to conceal thegraphic weaknesses. One-player missions are tedious. Only redeemingfeature is to play the two-player game with other ""South Park"" fans, and then only if you've gotten the codes to unlock favorite characters.Even with friends, you'll tire of it in a day."
2,"Boring, Boring and Boring","I simply find the game ordinary and boring. I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game.Man I was dissapointed!There is nothing new in the game. It is simply an ordinary shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park.Admitted: There are a few funny features in the game, the cow-shooting gun, Mr. Hanky the christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short while.My advise is: Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for something else."
1,Do I sense the words cash in?,"Why did they bother with this? Acclaim said ""All South park fans will love this... Captures the show's humour perfectly..."" Since when? I have never played such unfunny, unplayable tripe in all my life! Firstly the gameplay, terrible is my view. Foggy vision, humourless weaponry and a terrible idea for a plot!The characters for the game are even worse! listening to Stan shouting rubbish such as ""You mother ......! I kick your ...!"" after being hit just gets extremely annoying!If you are a fan of the show you'll buy a video set and enjoy it. Rather than tarnish the name of a hit comedy by playing this rushed awful package!Avoid it!"
2,"Fun, but gets boring quickly","This game is fun when you first play it, but once you see all the things you can do, you get bored with it quickly. The graphics parralell the animated show, but that isn't hard considering the low graphics SP is known for. All in all, it is worth renting for a night, but definitley not worth buying."
1,"Acclaim, I threw my PSX out because of this abominable turd.","South Park the game was released for the N64 on December 12 1998. Wow, two days after the second Turok game. Yeah, stick with that port cause this is just AWFUL! This version is soooo bad, Bubsy 3D said ""DAMN!"" This game is just so bad, I don't even feel like doing this review and the former Acclaim employees should be glad that I talked about this mess . It's like Acclaim's Superman 64."
3,Could be worse...,"This game is pretty bad, and I don't mean that in the good way. The graphics are horrible(but when it came out it was considered okay graphics) and the story line is just rediculous. But this game brings back some memoried of me and my brother when we were younger, and I enjoy just having this game around the house just to remember those days."
4,Great older game,"This game obviously is older, but well worth a few dollars and will work on the PS3 80gig (newer)."
1,This is horrible....,"Being a South Park fan, I was looking forward to this title. However, it is SO repetitive and annoying...the turkey level alone goes on FOREVER. Friends of mine have had the same reaction. It's a first-person shooter (or should we say first-person snowballer) that just has you running around the town of South Park throwing snowballs at turkeys. Yeah, I know, according to the packaging, that the game evolves into some sort of space/zombie creature thing, and you're supposed to save the town, but I never got that far due to the overlong turkey-shooting level...when I saw the average 4-star rating, I knew I had to respond. Perhaps younger people will like this due to the character tie-in, but this 34-year-old was bored and disappointed in this title."
1,"what, i have to give this ""game"" one star?!","People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game.This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window.The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring.I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay.If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is.Avoid this nerf dung at all costs."
2,Needs Improvement,"I love south park and was expecting more from the game when I heard about it. In story mode you can be any of the four 8-year-olds. All the unlockable characters can only be used in battle mode and that was one of the biggest dissapointments to me. Another was the characters always say the same thing, I think they should say something new each level or episode.And the last was that they only killed kenny in one episode on the game (the one with the robot turkey). They should've killed him more!!!! I bet that dissapointed alota kenny fans.I really wish they would've added more kenny deaths but oh well. I heard on a web-site that the creaters of SP are thinking about making a new video game but still don't know what company and game-system to have it on. It better be better than the others they made, thats for sure."
3,Meh,"This game could have been a heck of alot better. The idea of the game is pretty stupid. They should have taken things from different episodes and made that the game. The graphics are good, since it's only playstation. The multiplayer is pretty fun. Too bad this game wasn't released later on and they could have put Jimmy and Timmy in it. I'm glad I bought this game though."
1,IT'S FRIGGIN' CRAP!!!,"THIS GAME IS FRIGGIN' CRAP! I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH WOULD GIVE IT FIVE STARS! IT IS PURE CRAP! EVERYTHING ON IT IS FRIGGIN' CRAP! THE GRAPHICS ARE GRAP! THE GAMEPLAY IS CRAP! EVERYTHING IS CRAP! IT IS SO CRAPPY!!! IT IS CRAPPY! CRAPPY! CRAPPY! IF I WASN'T A CHRISTIAN,THERE WOULD BE TONS OF OTHER THINGS TO SAY..."
3,"High quality product and service, but didn't work for me.","I might as well have been taking chocolate syrup. This did nothing to get my labor going, but it tasted much better than the alcohol based tinctures that I bought at the health food store. Ultimately, the only thing that got my labor going was getting in the car and going for a bumpy ride. I would not purchase this product again for myself, but it may work fine for others."
4,My First Howlin' Wolf Album,"A lot of my favorite musicians credit ""Wolf"" in their influences and have even recorded or played his music live. (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Hendrix, The Stones...)so I really had to hear first hand what the fuss was about. I throughly enjoy this CD. It is haunting and left me thirsty for more. In fact, I now own roughly four different releases of Howlin Wolf's music. There are a lot of different releases with the same music on it. I really strongly suggest any fan of the electric blues pick up a copy of this album."
1,Inexcusable reprint,"Looks like someone photocopied the pages of a book. Print is too light to comfortably read, and someone else's marking area in the book in the margins. Never seen anything so shoddy passed off as new."
4,Dated but still relevant,A bit dated but the sections on training are well worth reading. There's not enough of this kind of literature.
2,Leather writing pad holder,"It didn't arrive in a very timely manner ~ two weeks later. This is a nice item, but relatively expensive and since it wasn't exactly what I had in mind, I decide to return it. The process for figuring out how to return it is a bit complicated & time consuming. You have to go to their website & contact them & then they send you information back. How about just putting the return policy informaion in with the order? And the company ""unbeatable sale, inc."" brags about their satisfaction & refund policy...it cost me $14.00 to return PLUS the original shipping & handling costs.I don't think so..."
2,Disappointing,"ascension n.1. The act or process of ascending; ascent.The authors of this book need to review this definition. Without revealing anything, the stories in this are flat-out poorly considered and lack continuity-checking. In one, for example, they take the excellent work previously done changing one 'adversarial' group into a three dimensional, believable group, and in this they revert to a one-dimensional 'We're sooooo evil' group.Another disappointing thing about this book is that they hyped the so-called '10th Sphere' - going as far as to include mention not only on the cover, but in the introduction - then it turns out that there IS no revelation about it. Rather, the '10th Sphere' is danced around as plot points.If you're a Mage or World of Darkness completist, get this book. If you aren't, you probably should consider giving this a pass."
4,A travel book that is more than a travel book!,"This is more than just your run of the mill travel book--this is a guide to fantasy. Whether you want to share elbow room in the playgrounds of the rich and famous, or just dream of an escape to the crystal waters, clear blue skys and white sands of the Caribbean, this guide will help you to transform such lofty dreams into an affordable reality. With colorful insights into the history of each location, Secret Carribean transports you into the adventure of the past, while beckoning you to realize your fantasies in the here and now. Pleasantly written with a gentle to the eye lay-out, this book will appeal to many readers, not just those planning a getaway to their own secret hideaway."
5,I LOVE JUSTIN and the book is awesome!!!!,The book is great.I love all the photos and facts. I like that they wrote the book themselves. This is definitely five stars!
5,This book brings you closer to the NSYNC stars.,This book lets you know all about those charming NSYNCers. By the end of the book you'll feel like they've been your friend for ages!
5,God I Love Pictures,"This book is cute, sweet, funny, insightful, and full of pictures. If you haven't read it yet, what the---- are you waiting for?"
5,Awesome book!,"This book rocks! It gives neato information that you can't find anywhere else! The pictures are wonderful! At first, I was kinda worried if I was just wasting my money on it....boy was I wrong! It's a great item to add to your N Sync collection! Stay N Sync!"
5,I luv the pictures of all of these 5 great guys!!,This book was the most awsome book ever! I think that each *NSYNC member needs to have alot more than only 5 stars. I don't think you can consider your self a *NSYNC fan without this book. You will read all of it the first time 'cause you can't ever put it down! I LOVE YA *NSYNC!
5,THis book has turned me into the #1 'N SYNC Fan .,I have been a fan of these boy bands for many years and I have to admit this group tops my list . They are down to earth funny and intelligent.I now know that having a favorite in this group is near impossible. I love them all and I think that they are great young artist.
5,NSYNC IS HOT HOT HOT!!!,I would suggest this book to any NSYNC fan. It tells all and the pics are great. This is definetly the best book about a group i've ever read. A must buy.
5,~This book is the *BEST* book ever!!! ~,"Usually most books about bands are pretty boring. They have no info on the band what so ever! But when I read the *Nsync book I thought it was AWESOME!! If your a *HUGE* fan of *Nsync like I am then you will LOVE this book! It has all the info on Justin, J.C, Joey, Chris, and Lance (the 5 hotties!) that you need to know!! There are also lots of hot pics of the singing sweeties. I think you should get the book and learn lots about these five fresh guys! ~~~Later Dayz and I'll C~Ya round, ~megan~"
5,Reconditioned? Really?,"Opened the box and couldn't believe this wasn't a brand new one! Only sign of it not being new was the instuction manual. Mixed up a batch of Carbon's Golden Malted batter like you get in the motel continental breakfasts and had two HUGE beautiful waffles in 3:30 minutes. Very simple controls, warm it up,set the time you want to bake waffles, add batter to one side and then the other and press start.Digital counter counts down to zero and then audio beep lets you know it's done.This thing is built like a Cat dozer and should last forever!! Hard to beat deal Amazon has with $25.00 promotion and free shipping."
2,a real disappointment,"Granted, the Playstation doesn't have quite the graphics of N-64 and certainly not the realism of Sega Dreamcast, however, I thought with this relatively simple and fun game they could really do a great job. Unfortunately, the graphics are no better than any other game. It is simple and fast paced (normally my kind of game) but it is a real design flaw that when you pass the ball to your teammate, you don't control the teammate (other than to shoot or pass). A more complicated game like NBA Live can even manage that simple feat. The dunks are great fun and I would imagine the game play with four people would be loads of fun (if I had friends I would be able to say so but, alas, such is not the case). My favorite game in the world is NFL Blitz and since Blitz and Showtime are both made by Midway, I expected more. So it goes."
5,Best game i ever played!,"the graphics are sweeeeeeeet and the player faces are like real and i like to do freaky dunks. Like, one time.... i like played the game.... and i like..... lost. But it was still like, totally radical dude."
2,Twin cam,"There are a some good tips, but the book is fairly unstructured andcontains numerous annoying grammatical errors.In general, not very well written.Not recommended."
1,Don't buy,"Change the Oil is not going to win any book awards. It was disappointing. Very poorly organized with random points made through out and other points repeated multiple times. The information could have been conveyed in about 10 well written pages. It could have used a proof reader. There were many misspellings, missing words, etc. Photos were of a very poor quality. I really don't know whether I should trust the information. I recommend you find another source for the information"
3,How to change your oil.,"This book is very easy to read. It is a bit dated. It doesn't mention Harleys newer than 2006. I like how it tells you exactly what tools you need. I would recommned this book only if you have very little to no mechanical skills. Otherwise, a shop manual would be a better investment."
3,Useful Information,Considering the cost of service work this book is worth picking up. Most factory repair manuals are generic in nature and don't demonstrate the fine details to carry out some maintenance tasks as this book does. I appreciate all tips and tricks I can get from anyone who has done the task before. I admire the authors desire to share what he knows and help others enjoy maintaining their bikes. My recommendation for the next printing issue is to condense the material as much as possible. The current edition is repetitive in many places and this is distracting to the reader. I found myself rereading the material to make sure I didn't miss something. I do know I will refer to my copy the first few time I do general maintenance on my HD.
1,Harleys for dummies?,"OMG, if you don't know how to change your oil, you better get a different bike. This shows who rides Harleys now!!! Don't for get to put loctite on the oil plug guys! ROTGLMAO"
1,Needs more information,"I'd like to see a chapter on adding air to your tires, or maybe that will be his next book..."
1,Buyer beware,"From my experience with other Sullivan University eDocs, they are nothing more than a glossy brochure meant to bring in a few bucks and get the author published. You can probably find all of the info in the eDoc (for which you pay $3.50) doing a web search (free). I remain disappointed that a university would be involved in publishing and charging for ""articles"" with such little intellectual value."
5,A great comprhensive overview--this guy is a scene,you'll learn some wild licks that will really impress the chicks
1,Please don't be stupid and buy this...,"I love Teen Titans, don't get me wrong. But if you buy each season seperately you'll save over $10. Why would you buy this?"
1,Hmmmmm,"Let's see - first three boxes are $12 individually...or I could buy all three together for over $50?I'm not the best at math, but that is crazy...does someone want to tell me what I am missing?"
2,"""coloring"" it didn't help","In all the books by/for/about the Marx Brothers, ""Room Service"" is usually uniformly and justifiably named as ""their worst."" ""Justifiably"" is the word to remember there. This is DREADFUL, simply tear-jerkingly BORING. I think the ""plot"" was originally a Broadway play, but, if so, I can imagine it fell flat pretty quickly. This just is not funny AT ALL, and at least ""Love Happy"" had Marilyn Monroe in it."
4,"Very good book, a little short in content.",The first several chapters were just prep information. But the practical exercises in the second half were very good and we are using them with our son.
2,Issues....,"Although it is said to be white, when you appy the decal it is actually transparent! You can see right through it to whatever is underneath."
2,sort of home alarm,"after 3 years of use, the problem begins, this alarm and all its detectors have batteries that nowhere to be found. it does not use a normal aa or aaa batteries, you can buy them but they are ridiculously expensive because it is hard to find."
2,Meh..I've had better,"I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it. But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is ""Peppermint"". I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting. I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor. Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas. Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy. In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea."
3,Simplistic but Good,"This book might be too simplistic for savvy and experienced investors, but for those with less knowledge, it could be very helpful. Basic rules and guidelines are well explained and good, commonsense advice given."
4,70's Style,I've bought here in Amazon these pair 2 1/2 years ago because looks like my 70's and early 80's heros shoes. It cost me a fewer less dollars by the way.After all thes time it's still in perfect condition.My only complain is that leather isn't as black as it would be.I recommend it.
2,Warning: NOT FOR ZIRE 72 and shoddy workmanship,"Not only does it not fit the Zire 72 (the opening is at least half and inch too small for the screen), but the case I received even had a seriously offset hole for the bottom buttons. I've had decent Belkin products before, but this was real disappointing."
4,Rose water doesn't require a fake hydrosole but its really cool,"So far, so good. I've made tons of rosewater for myself and my friends. I like the rosewater instructions just didn't think I needed to boil two thin, white ceramic bowls inside a non-steel pot. Yes, I used a non-stick. Over-all this book is very useful for those of us who want to protect our energies in a permanent fashion. I look forward to seeing a Pantheacon presentation sometime from the author. Now if only I can find more bottles for my rosewater since I used citrus not the vodka suggested. I didn't want people to think this stuff is edible, it isn't. If it sits around long enough, you get the particles reanimating, kind of like rose-zombies. So now I have to take my remaining bottles and filter their water should this be the case Ingenious recipe for rose-water, even if we could have just been told to get a real hydro-sole in order to spare us our kitchenware. :)"
5,Witch's Shield,"Let's face it, especially in today's world, we all need a little protection! This book gives very helpful tips on how to protect yourself in various situations. Glad that it is in my library."
3,for wiccans,i think its a good book if you want to stand by someone elses morals but for yourself to learn no it only teaches you the weaker magick in my opinion...even tho it has some really good points.
3,It's alright...,"For someone who has never been exposed to psychic-self defense, this is probably a good book, if a bit strong on the ""harm none"" aspect. It has some decent meditations and he spends a lot of time working on mindset, which I consider to be the most important part of defense. However, as someone who has read a number of other books on energy work, I found it to be rather strong on emphasizing ritual and materials. As a college student, I am unable to practice the smudging he talks about, and its not economically feasible for me to purchase all the different herbs and mixes and such that he recommends to use to protect yourself. I would have preferred a book that focused on things like affirmative visualizations and thoughts than one that requires to you rely on spirit allies and physical tools."
3,Euro-focus,"Written from a European focus. That means still useful and inspirational to a U.S. inquirer, but might leave out info needed by U.S. citizen in terms of availability of certain opportunities."
3,could do without,"Out dated, not enough details, mainly for English students after A levels.Full of truism such as ""a year to think to mature and to take charge ?!!""I was not any wiser than after having read some articles on the web about summer jobs abroad. It is a good idea to publish about different possibilities for a gap year. This 'tool' needs to be more refine."
2,Not holding strong charge.,"Bought these to replace factory batteries, but they stayed charged only about half as long as the used batteries I wanted to replace.Shipping and packing was great, but the product just did not satisfy. Look elsewhere for your phone battery."
5,just the ticket!,"I'll chime in with the 5 star reviewers. When my Panasonic phone started fading after only 20 minutes of conversation, I shopped replacement batteries. Some were priced at about half of what I paid for the phone.For a buck (well, by the time you factor in the seemingly excessive $4.99 shipping and handling charge, it's not exactly a one dollar bet), I thought I'd try this battery. If it performed as poorly as the 2 star reviewers suggested, I wouldn't be out a whole lot of money.Turns out, that the battery works as well as advertised. I doubt I'll ever yap on the phone long enough to test the battery's limit, but if I can get a couple additional years of service out of my cordless phone, I'll be delighted.How can you go wrong?"
1,15 minutes talk time on full charge,"I have this battery for about 2 months. Sadly, a fully charged battery allowed only 15 minutes of conversation on a Panasonic 2.4GHz cordless phone. I don't recommend this low-performance generic product. (The picture is nothing like the delivered product.)"
2,"Good price, but battery dies fast",Price on item is good... But the battery simply does not last... It worked really good for about 2 or 3 months then the charge times on the battery lasted about 1 hour before it needed to be recharged again. I would stick to the Panasonic brand in the future
1,10 minutes on full charge,"Bought this battery from emtcom about 3 months ago. It just won't keep charge, allowing only about 10-15 minutes of talk time."
1,Won't keep a charge,"Not sure if I reviewed this item on a prior occassion, if I did this would be an update after a few months of use.When I first received the item, it was not packaged as it is shown in the picture. The item received was not packaged and neither was it labeled/branded. Except for a really snug fit everything seemed to be working fine.Now the down side. After only a few months of use, the battery no longer holds charges. If I fully charge it over night and then take it out. By the next morning the battery would be drained without ever using it. When you figure in the shipping cost this is $5 down the drain. By comparison, the $12 battery I bought from another site 12 months ago for another phone is working just fine. Lesson learned. So folks, keep away from this one."
1,Photo shows that the battery is not made by Panasonic,The photo clearly shows that the battery is not made by Panasonic.Why is Panasonic listed by Amazon as the manufacturer?
5,walk around phone battery,"Two batteries arrived quickly, were easy to replace in my two handsets, and took a full charge. No more calls ending suddenly due to lack of juice."
4,batteries to make the phone last longer,I was going through my items to send to the Goodwill and found 6 different phones. Why they all ended up there is basically the same reason...expensive batteries. These fulfilled a need of not having to replace another phone(s) and adding more life to something that actually works. I bought these for the price and they work as stated.
3,Are you ready for Ready to Rumble?,"Ready to Rumble is a very interesting boxing game. It has quite a few characters to select from and is unique in it's design of each of it's characters moves according to their particular height weight and reach. It's a very nice game. I give it a 3 out of 5 just because the game play is fairly simple and the challenge is not that great. All that a side it's very entertaining and it will give you hours of fun with your friends. Put in your mouth piece, strap on your head gear, and touch gloves. Are you Ready to Rumble??"
4,AOK for FUN !!,"This game my kids love, ages 5 and 8. I knew before I bought it but have confirmed it now after they opened for christmas!!Good game for them fighting guys !!!!"
4,Fun for all,"Boxing game presented in cartoon style with caicature boxers. Although you have to punch and knockout there is no blood or visible signs of violence. All boxers are larger than life, and the playability is good. In arcade mode you can play against computer or friend and there is a championship mode where you can place bets and take your boxer through the ranks training him or her in the gym along the way. Loads quickly also."
4,Worth 10 dollars!,"This games is worth it!awsome hillarious characters!you can start a career and go in the gym and do arobics,lift weights,hit punching bags,take stararoids and more to build your guy/girl up!buy this game!P.S.DO NOT BUY READY 2 RUMBLE ROUND 2..."
4,great new offer,"Suicide Commando surely released a great new album. The tracks sound this time more like the (old) Wumpscut) and I like it. Although I think their last album Axis Of Evil was one of their best , I just loved the melotron melancholic choirs in the back ground, Bind , Torture Kill is a must for all Suicide Commando fans. No one will be disappointed, for sure.I gave it 4 stars and not 5 just to indicate that Johan should stay on his own path and not go into Wumpscut too much."
4,"Terrorpop!! Good, Unoriginal","For newcomers, Suicide Commando is evil dance music. Crunchy beats, raw sawtooth keys, and heavily distorted vocals.Bind, Torture, & Kill is exactly what I expected it to be. Very dancy, moderately intelligent lyrics, very dark.It's also gone nowhere since Axis of Evil. It is extremely similar, despite what some other reviews might say. So much so that you recognize the exact sounds that he recycled from older songs for this album. The production on this one is a hair better, and the songwriting is noticeably weaker. His sound worked better as simpler. Axis of Evil was extremely catchy. Bind, Torture, & Kill notsomuch. Plus what's with the album artwork? It looks like an ad from the Seattle Sinner.Bind, Torture, and Kill does what it does very well- the evil dancy thing. But it's nothing special."
3,"Some good, some bad","I love the title of the Cd, but the tracks are too inconsistent. The beats of ""War Zone"" and ""Do it how you feel"" got me going, but other than that the CD failed to do it for me. Many of the tracks are lame, tbut the lyrics kept me interested and will keep me listening to the CD. A decent purchase, but not a best seller."
3,Over Instrumented and layer 2 problems,This would have been an amazing DVD if the mix had been better! The instruments tend to drown out the vocals. The rear channels tend to jump up and down in volume at the end of the cut objectionably.Chapter 12 to the end was totally unwatchable. The second layer was not readable by my Denon 2500. I have never had a problem reading any other disk.
3,Quite well merged.,"There are a few good, actually great songs on this DVD. Shania Twain rules, Celine Dion is fantastic and Gloria Estefan rocks everything down. Because of these three stars, it's worthy, but I won't give comment about others, 'cuz it wouldn't be good, trust me."
5,BEST MUSIC LINE UP IN THE WORLD,IT AWESOME.I loved it.I thas all the greatest women in music all lined and they give a great show that u can watch over and over. and will want to watch over and over.grand finally is the best.MUSIC WISE NOTHING CAN TOP THIS.i watched this once and it opened me up to them and i found out that i liked shania twain and now i have to of her cd's.i liked everyone on there.when they sing the finally you will be amazed by there great talent!
4,another goodie!,"Second diva's collection....different artists from diva's 1Aretha Franklin shows her talent, Gloria Estefan knows how to entertain an audience, Maria Carey and Shania Twain sound brilliant... add Carole King and you have a perfect blend for all musical tastes.... well worth adding this dvd!!!"
3,Average sounding DVD of some great singers,If you really like the singers featured in this DVD you will most likely like this one. I think the sound quality is barely above average not even close to Eagles Hell Freezes Over on DTS.
3,Too Much Ego,"Not bad, although lets see, you have 3 ""divas"" trying to outscream and steal the show from each other, which becomes embarrassingly more evident as the show goes on. Riiiiight.The real star of this show was Shania Twain. She actually writes her own material, concentrates on singing with heart instead of screaming and she can play guitar while performing....plus she doesn't have an ego like the rest of the performers and didn't try to upstage anyone *cough*Celine*cough* although as far as talent and attitude is concerned, Shania clearly outshined the rest."
1,Screaming Alley Cats,"I watched this when it first aired and needless to say I was disgusted. I was a fan of Gloria Estefan, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey and had hopes the three of them would be on a stage together. When it finally happened the results sickened me. My first complaint was that Mariah Carey added that hideous remix to her song My All that RUINS it.My second complaint was with the finale. Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey were trying to outscream each other while Gloria and Shania Twain were left in the dust. It was childish behavior by three grown women who should have known better."
5,"BEST OF THE BEST, A MUST OWN FOR MUSIC FANS","The songs selection were excellent. ARETHA RULES! Mariah came a distant second followed by Celine, Gloria & then Shania. They are all great Divas but Aretha simply has unlimited singing power. That can be seen when Mariah & Aretha sang together. It will be perfect if Whitney, who came to this year's Divas show, can be there last year."
2,Only one fifth of this DVD is great.,"I only enjoyed one fifth of this DVD. Shania Twain is the best, the greatest! She got some nice pants on. 5 stars for Shania, 1 star each for the rest. The DVD gets 2 stars."
4,Mariah is the best,"The only reason I bought this tape is because of Mariah's amazing performances of My All, Make It Happen, and Chain Of Fools with the Aretha. Those are the highlights and the only thing good about the tape...."
5,Fun!,Several of us enjoy watching this. Terrific performances by these lovely women. Go divas! It's a keeper in our collection.
2,unprepared name thrower...,"practiced together 2 hrs before the show?!?! I would say some single songs were done well. but whole show was too superficial. notice carol king joined the group a day before the concert and you will see frustrated faces as when they sing together. voices clash at the same vocal range and it looks as if the singers were fighting to have their voice heard on some songs. it's been mixed pretty bad too. you can hear crowds cheering in the real speakers noticebly sudden that you can almost imagine the turning knobs on sound engineer's volume. ""save the music"" campaign should've been left out as an extra feature for dvd. I'm just dissapointed that it could've been so much better. it was a dvd with nice dresses to look at."
1,Terrible DVD,There is voice over commentary on top of all performances and no way to listen to just the performance. People who trash such classic music as these clowns did out to be put in prison!
4,Good Album Related Analysis,"This documentary starts with a look at CCR's self titled debut album and continues through ""Bayou Country"", ""Green River"" and the rest of their LPs. Excerpts from interviews with drummer Doug Clifford and bassist Stu Cook are included along analysis from various critics, DJs and other music biz folks.Each album is given a ""star rating"", with it's more popular and important songs discussed. Hardcore CCR fans may not learn a whole lot new. But it's still a good primer on the band, and which records to buy first, for new or casual fans."
4,The best author,"The book was written in the early 1900,s. I have a old copy, but enjoy the old fashioned story so much that it was nice to find it at a decent price so I could share some books with friends."
5,"Gorgeous, wonderfully written book","An engaging story with beautiful illustrations. After our first read, my 5 year-old daughter (obsessed with unicorns) wanted to fall asleep immediately so she could ride the unicorn in her dreams. She believes in unicorns, just as Millie does. She insists that people who believe in them are the only ones who can see them, and that one day, she will see them."
5,The most beautiful book ever,"I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas and let me tell you, it is impressive! I was so surprised at how big the book was, then was really really impressed after reading it. It is fabulously written and illustrated....a must read every night!"
5,"Delightful, charming, happy ending.... wholesome story.","The artwork is beautiful, the story is a delight. My daughter got this for her 4th birthday and this has become a staple bedtime story. It's long enough to have substance, short enough that it doesn't drag. I can't recommend it enough."
2,Too sharp.,"I bought these tweezers to use for facial hair removal. I'm sure they're well made, but the edges were so sharp, they cut the hair instead of allowing me to pull it out. Making them useless, sad to say."
3,bought direct from Rubis - missing protective cover.,Paid top dollar for this product direct from Rubis - arrived missing the protective covers. Very disappointed for the money paid - otherwise the tweezers are ok. Will not buy from Rubis again.
5,Best tweezers ever,"These tweezers will grab the finest hairs like a vise. They're extremely well-made, and have perfectly ground tips. If all you've ever used before are ""dime store"" tweezers, you're in for a treat with these. While not inexpensive, they are a great value considering their quality; besides, no one ever regrets buying good tools."
1,Not happy,The wood is very cheap and thing stained immediately and does not hold up well in the weather..The tires stink11 They are very noxious and i feel not goo to smell so I have to store out in the winter snowy months!!! These were such wonderful wagons when ! was young and my children.........Too much of a hassle to dis assemble and return..Hard to assemble........over all feel I got ripped off
1,Poor Quality.,"The materials used for this product are not acceptable. The sides are flimsy balsam wood that I expect to break within a week. The tires reak a toxic order. This not a good product, junk!"
1,Missing parts and not historic Radio Flyer quality,"Two key metal plates for the steering linkage were missing when the wagon arrived. The wagon was delivered in a damage-free box by FedEx. This problem points back to quality control issues at the manufacturer. The wood body for the wagon appeared to be made of medium grade wood and would not hold up well if the wagon was left outside in the elements. The ""rubber"" tires had a pungent odor so I had to keep them out in the garage while I waited for the seller to arrange for the wagon to be picked up under warrantee and my money refunded. I should have believed the other negative reviews about the current inferior quality of Radio Flyer products. I had to use the Amazon.com A-to-z Guarantee to get a full refund."
1,"Terrible quality wagon, don't buy it.","This product is absalutely terribly built. Had to return it and get the metal framed wagon. Amazon was easy to work with when I had to return it, that made things better. I had to expedite the shipment of the metal framed wagon in time for my son's 2nd bday."
3,good,it is very bulky but that may be what you are looking for. the wood on the bottom and the sides do not seem very sturdy but it does hold my 21 pound son.
4,Not Like They Use to Be,"I purchased this wagon for my nephew. It has been a tradition in our family to have a wooden wagon for our children. When I was young some 50 years ago (I'm an old guy) my grandfather built a wooden wagon from scratch for us kids. Then my father built one for his grandkids. The Radio Flyer wagon was also given in place of building one.This wagon is very nice buy not very sturdy. The bottom is a thin piece of at best 1/8"" ply supported by thin runners. The load capacity is not much and a small child is all that should be in this wagon. If a young child (over 10) were to use this he/she may break through the bottom. I would think a 1/4"" bottom would have been much stronger and add to this wagons usefulness."
4,Fun wagon with limits,"We've had the wagon for a year and it is great, durable wagon for toting the tot around. But there are a few ""myths"" I would like to debunk.1. Great for all-terrain. I suppose but even in my relatively level backyard, my boys bumps all over the wagon when I pull him a long. It's very nice on smooth dirt, gravel and asphalt.2. ""Memories of a red wagon."" You're kid might have memories of being pulled in a red wagon; but don't think he/she will be able to pull this wagon. It's big and awkward for a young kind. If you want a wagon where they can tote their playthings, thing smaller.The only other item worth mentioning is that the pain job on these wagon isn't very good. In the one year we've had it; it's be left outside a few times in light rain and the paint is all-ready peeling."
2,Too expensive for the build quality,Build quality merits a price of about half of what it typically sells for imo. Another example of offshore made minimal quality product marketed by the illusion of American heritage.
4,Assembly is fairly simple--quality product,"I've assembled a number of children's toys and even other wagons. If you have, you know how annoying poor instructions or complex assembly can be. This one was straightforward and the instructions were dead on. I was pleasantly surprised. The product appears to be quality compared with toys out on the market nowadays. While I wasn't that impressed with Radio Flyer's tricycle, this product has me satisfied. I'd recommend it. Our 1 and 3 year olds love to ride in it."
5,"Ordered for my Grand kids, and they love it...",I ordered this for my grand kids. They live in another state. The product was delivered on time. They really love it.
4,great fun,"my five and 17 month-old have had a blast being taken around in this wagon. Looks good, is easy to pull and very sturdy. Even my eight year-old can join in on the fun!"
4,very good,"product was excellent, delivery was very prompt. 2 issues...1). had a very strong odor, like insecticide and needed to be left outside for several days. 2). base of wagon had split wood , but we glued it and it was fine"
5,My new toy at 45 years old.,"I was very pleased. It took two pair of hands to put together, but it was well worth the purchase when we packed all of our necessary needs to picnic and watch the fireworks earlier this month. I love my new radio flyer. : )"
5,fun for the beach,Overall it was easy to assemble. I did it myself since my husband was out of town. It is a good cart to have for beach or park outings!
5,wagon review,This wagon is very sturdy and easy to pull. I didn't realize when I bought it that is was wooden. But it is beautiful.
5,the best,"This is the best wagon on the market. period. The all terrain wheels are awesome on grass, gravel, rocks, etc and have a smooth ride on pavement... my 1 year old LOVES this thing too. the price difference is worth it over the plastic ones with small tires."
3,Made in China,"Made in China. No country of origin was provided, so I assumed it was made in the USA. I paid more for the Radio Flyer name because of that. A similar wagon is sold at Harbor Freight for $69.99 made in China. I opted for this one and paid more for it because I thought I was paying for made in the USA.It went together fairly easily. Used it for a trip to the Farmer's Market this morning. Too new to know about durability, etc.Had I known this was made in China, I would have purchased the cheaper one from Harbor Freight."
1,HARD TO PULL,"I wanted to like this wagon, after all it looked like so much fun!! However the reality is that its hard to pull, expensive and uncomfortable for your children. My son did not like having his legs out like he was lying down. He wanted to sit up and look out. My son is long and with him sitting in it, I had no room for anything else. the bed is hard and if you hit a bump, well you can see where I am going with it. I like that it holds alot of weight, however, my back after pulling my 35lb son one day was in such pain that it was not worth it at all. he refuses to go it and I can't blame him. I think when he gets older he will like it for hauling stuff in, but I am selling it before then and getting a step 2wagon. he seemed to like that one much better. Overall I would say no to this product as a wagon to haul your kids in."
5,Great,This was a gift for my grand daughter. It will come in very handy next summer to pull her around in the yard.
2,poor quality,"We are not so happy with the quality of this wagon. One of the bolts was missing, and wood is low grade. Wish we had ordered the metal wagon with wooden sides."
2,What a Disappointment!,"Bought this for a friend's son for his birthday and it arrived quickly. However, one of the wooden pieces was cracked. I'm hoping we can get it replaced, but I'm disappointed about the quality, especially after we paid so much for it! I hope customer service doesn't suck."
2,Great Wagon - Powerful bad smell,I ordered this wagon for Christmas. When it arrived the box smelled. Thinking it was the packing I wasn't to worried about it. My garage smelled pretty bad while waiting for the holidays. I build the wagon Christmas Eve and throw away the box thinking problem solved. Wagon still smells and if it is in our car the whole SUV stinks. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem? Kids and I love the wagon. I have washed it with Lysol wipes and tried windex on the tires. Any help would be great.
4,Great product,"This is a great Wagon, it was easy to assemble and looks to be very sturdy. The only complaint I have is that the rubber tires smell so strongly of rubber it has to stay in the garage or the smell will overtake the room it is in. Hopefully that goes away over time."
3,Paint Chipped,"I only had the wagon a month and all the stain and paint started to chip off. It is a durable wagon, but was not happy with chipping."
1,Flimy and suffocatingly toxic-smelling tires,"If never exposed to the elements, this wagon may do fine. The walls work well and remove easily. But the wooden base won't take more than a few rains. The handle is too short (for me anyway - I'm 6'2""). The whole steering mechanism is very flimsy and will not support pulling any load up over a curb.Worst of all, the tires have by far the most unbelievably strong toxic smell. In order to transport the wagon in our van, I had to wrap the tires in plastic bags and keep the windows cracked to avoid suffocating the children. This is after leaving the wagon outside to air for almost a week. I don't know what chemicals are in this wagon's tires - but I'm sure it's not something you want children around. I really wanted to love this wagon - but am going to have to return it. I've nominated this product on [...]"
2,Poor Quality is not what i expected,The historical quality aspect of this brand are seriously in question considering the poor workmanship and bare minimum materials used in the wagon I purchased. I replaced the side rails because of the flimsy and un-matched design plus re-finished the wood base although i suspect that will need to be replaced soon because of the wood the used is a soft wood prone to damage or decay. I'm not opposed to paying more if the quality is there but regretfully it is not with this item and the price is not justified. Will not buy anything else from this manufacturer because of fear of poor quality.... It's a shame!!!!!
5,Great Wagon For Anyone!,"I had to send the original back because three of the railings were damaged and the floor bed was no put together correctly. Amazons return program is awesome! I did everything online, they printed me a label to put on the original box to send back, and in the mean time they overnight-ed a replacement!! The replacement was much better! The box was in much better shape than the first, and all the parts were there and undamaged and the floorbed was properly put together.I do feel that they could have made the box a little bigger to allow more packing cushion so that the railings will not break during shipping since these are made of wood. It was difficult to get the original one back into the box to send back, but I managed."
5,Radio Wagon,"My son loves his wagon. Especially when we walked for the March of Dimes. Easy to pull on gravel, sidewalks and uphill. Easy to pull even by twin 2 year old boy who like to pull each other."
4,"Nice wagon, but tires reek","This is a nice wagon. Bought it for our granddaughters. @ 3 months of light usage-- So far, so good. I would feel better if the wheels were secured by pins or nuts, rather than the 'pound-on axle caps'. A major annoyance is the odor that is emitted by the tires. It's really obnoxious and strong. I was nearly overwhelmed by the odor, while doing the assembly in my basement. The wagon is now housed in a garden shed because the odor is still so strong, too strong for even the garage. It is obvious that this wagon should not be left out in the elements; I'm pretty certain that the wood would de-laminate and warp, if it gets wet."
5,Radio Flyer Review,"This wagon was purchased for our 20 month old Granddaughter. The air filled tires give her a smooth ride, the long handle make it easy for us to pull and the side rails make it safe for her to ride. We are very pleased with the the product, the service and the price of the wagon. The easy to follow directions made it very easy to assemble in a relatively short period of time. The wagon is quite sturdy and well built and I expect it to last many years."
5,Everyone should own a red Radio Flyer wagon.,"TheRadio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagonwagon is a must have for us. THE key feature that was the deciding factor on this wagon (over others) are the air tires. We live near the beach, and air tires are a must for negotiating the beach. I wanted a wagon with a cooler (like Radio Flyer's plastic ones) but found none with the right tires, so this one will have to do. We have outdoor movies on weekend evenings at our house, and have found the wagon to be invaluable as a kid corralling tool during the movies. They think it is their own special space, and we know it has a ""fence."" It made a great Mother's Day gift."
4,All Terrain Radio Flyer Wagon Review,"I bought this wagon for my 1-year old grandson. He loves it and wants to ride in it so much, his parents had to put it in the garage because he wouldn't stay away from it. Nice feeling for it to be so obvious that my gift was his favorite. I think he'll (and his parents) enjoy this item for a number of years to come. One caution, with young children, the handle can fall down when the wagon is just setting there and could hit the child, so keep the handle downward when child is ""playing"" with the wagon and not riding in it. It's tall fence-like sides are perfect for safety and security of younger kids as they ride around and get lots of fresh air and sunshine!"
3,ATW #29 ALL TERRAIN CARGO VEHICLE,"I purchased this item last year, as a gift. When it was used at the beach, I was extremely disappointed that it was far too difficult to wheel in the sand. We were carrying a baby and some typical beach gear. We tried it both with and without releasing some air from the tires. Be sure to measure your trunk space before purchasing, as it does not fit well into some SUVs and is very heavy. It requires about 1-1/2 hours assembly time, unless you do this kind of thing everyday.I was thinking of purchasing another for normal terrain, but i would like some alternative suggestions, if anyone has any ideas.The low rating was due both to my annoyance at trying to pull it through the sand and the ""so what"" attitude i received when i called the company asking for alternative suggestions.I would be curious to know if the costco item is #29 or the smaller wagon."
5,GREAT WAGON!!,"My parents bought this wagon for our one year old son's birthday and we couldn't be happier with it -- he absolutely loves riding in it! We also have a two and a half year old who is very big for his age and both kids fit very comfortably. I would definitely recommend getting the padding (just make sure you get the Radio Flyer Pad set that fits this specific wagon) as it seems to make it a much more comfortable ride for the kids. Both my sons absolutely love riding in this wagon -- we use it on the street and have also had great success trekking across the beach! Although it's a bit pricey, I believe this wagon is worth every penny!"
1,my backpack came apart at the seams,"I loved my first trager backpack. After many years of use it eventually came apart at the seams. I liked it so much, that I bought another. The same thing happened, the seams came apart, but this time it happened almost immediately. I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement. I did this. Then I NEVER heard back from them again. I have emailed, called and left VMs and tried everything. They have never responded to me. I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day. I will not buy another Trager product."
2,Solving the Disc Error Problem.,"I have ""fixed"" several of these units.The problem is the exceptionally poor quality rubber shock mounts in the rear of the Laser/drive motor assembly.The shocks get ""mushy and the rear drops down and the DVD won't spin. The fix is a 'paper clip' to hold the rear of the assy up."
2,Maybe its just me,"When I first bought the dvd machine for my son as a X-mas Present, it did not work the day we bought it. His new Janet Jackson DVD got stuck in the machine, so we had to take it back and ask them to please send us back the Janet DVD (which they never did by the way, so I ended up buying another dvd). Once they sent me another machine, at frist it worked well. Although at times it would freeze, and jump. Then about 4 monnths later, it froze, but it could not be shut off. My son removed the plug and now it will not shut back on, so his Poetic Justice dvd (staring Janet Jackson ""He's her biggest fan!) is stuck inside the machine. I had it up to my neck with this machine, so I am just going to buy him a more expensive machine, one worth the money. It might just be me, but if you do not want to be in my shoes DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Unreliable,"This player worked great... for 4 months. Just outside the warranty window, it ceased playing NTSC (American-formatted) DVDs. It will play CDs, but that's about it. Toshiba says ""that's impossible"" (after working our way through the non-existant service/minimal website to find someone to speak with). Local service ""can't fix it"". Between the sudden breakdown and seeming lack of support, we adamently do not recommend this Toshiba product."
5,Nothing bad to report,"The guy who wrote the review for the SD2700 below should be disregarded. This is a great player. Simple design, plays almost everything (no DVD-Recordable compatability). Picture quality is second to none. I have watched carefully and have not yet found any pixelation in any movies. The PLUGE black-level setting is a VERY NICE feature: takes a DVD that would look washed-out on another player and makes it vibrant and brilliant. Sound quality with a 192Khz audio DAC is fantastic: it plays DVDs, CDs, and MP3s at HIGH volume levels though my receiver with no noticeable distortion. This is an inexpensive but masterfully made DVD player."
2,Disk error from day one,"Right out of the box, the DVD player returned a 'disk error' message as a result of the loading operation. Returned it to a Toshiba service center. Still waiting for its return... I never expected to get faulty equipment right out of the box from a name brand such as Toshiba. Quite disappointing."
1,Toshiba SD-2800 DVD Player - DISC ERROR,"I had my Toshiba SD-2800 DVD player for 18 months. It worked well up until the other day, when ""Disc Error"" appeared after I put a movie in that I had rented. I tried several different discs and all had the same error, I even verified the discs were fine by playing them on my PC. I then checked out the net and found that the ""Disc Error"" is a very prevalent problem with this player and that I actually did pretty good getting 18 months out of it, as most seem to die at 12! It is not acceptable for a DVD player to breakdown after a year and a half of playing about half a dozen DVDs a month in it. I will not buy Toshiba again. Now that this machine is going in the trash, I'm going to go and buy a new Panasonic, as I have other electronic items of theirs and haven't had any problems."
1,Got ripped.,"After two and a half months, the player stopped working. Every time I put in a disc I get a ""Disc Error."" Very disappointing."
2,"Reliability Problems, Too","I also bought a similar model from Amazon.com last year and the florescent display on it went erratic and died after less than 100 hours use. I've noted additional quirks, such as erratic freezes in DVD and CD playback. Earlier Toshiba products I've owned have gone decades without a problem."
1,A baaaaaaad machine,After light use for a few months the machine can no longer read disc's. Not a very good product.
1,Died after 10 months of use,"I just wanted to add my story to the ten or so other similar ones. After 10 months of use of about 1 dvd per week, the machine will no longer power on. Even worse, I have no idea how I will get the RENTED dvd out of the thing! Way to go Toshiba!This seems like it might be a decent candidate for class action..."
1,Toshiba Disc Error problems,"Although Toshiba won't admit it, I believe some of their DVD players have faulty programs. My SD2800 player went in for ""Disc Error"" problem (Nov. 2003). No disc would play. Toshiba fixed it and did a firmware upgrade and charged me for the repair. The head technician then told me ""I would be happy to know"" that the player did not need any upgrade for any reason. He assured me that the upgrade had nothing to do with the problem, yet, he could not tell me what the upgrade was for or why it was done. I asked if it was possible that the upgrade addressed a faulty program causing the disc problem. He said it WAS possible but no it did WASN'T the cause of the problem. What caused the problem? He did not know. WHAT??? Avoid any Toshiba product until they ""upgrade"" their service departments."
2,Mechanical flaw???,This DVD player generally plays well however disks tend to come dislodged from their slots as the carousel spins. At one point I had to take off the cover in order to retrieve a disk. It's a real annoyance which should never happen.
1,Fancy Features but Unreliable,"Consider this before you buy: Is it more important to buy cheap now (and pay more later for replacement/repair)? Or is it more important to get a machine that lasts? My machine lasted for just over a year (14 months). Now it freezes and jumps an hour into almost every movie. Luckily, I bought a ""3-year extended warranty contract"" from a third party (GE), so getting a repair or replacement costs me nothing. Today the repair technician called to say that the video relay board has gone bad and the part is not available from Toshiba. He also said that this was a common problem with the machine. Don't buy this product (unless you don't mind buying another one next year.)"
3,Two's a Charm,"I had several problems with the first one we ordered, primarily related to ""pausing"" in the middle of the film and digital breakup (little squares all over the screen."" We returned it and got another one. We have had the replacement for many months now and haven't had a single problem. This is our second Toshiba. We had no problems with our first."
4,Reliable and straightforward DVD player,"For the 5 or so years I've had this player it's been a real trooper. It's been easy to setup and use. The only ""disc error"" issues have arisen from burned discs that might have been overly compressed, or with a codec that is too new for it. However, among the virtues I've found with this device, is the wonderful quality of audio I get using the optical out with my component stereo system. The only knock against it: right near the beginning of playing almost any DVD, like a record, it skips one second of audio and then continues with no problem the rest of the way. I never understood this, but have lived easily with it.Overall, this DVD player has served me well, and I would recommend it to most folks. Of course, with many things headed toward HD, this unit is pretty well obsolete. However, if you are currently happy not needing to see every pore on a person, instead opting for an engaging story, this unit is simple and perfect."
5,Simple and easy,"We bought this DVD player about 6 months ago...so happy with it we're making sure to buy the same one as a gift. It's simple to hook up and understand, and very easy to use. One feature that we LOVE and that not all DVD players have, is that if we shut the DVD player off, it automatically restarts at the same spot we left off. My son's DVD player (another brand) does not do this...it's very inconvenient to have to remember where you were and fast forward to that spot if you don't watch a movie all the way through."
1,Toshiba SD-2800 Blues (and Reds),"We bought a Toshiba because the Toshiba VCR (M674) has been working like a champ. The SD-2800 worked fine for a number of months, but then output red-ish the bluish videos and then finally bit the dust. This after less then 6 months of very light use. I wouldn't recommend this particular product, although my other Toshiba products have held up well."
1,Not Reliable,"After much research and seeing high-ratings on Toshiba's DVD players, we bought a similar model last year. Used it for less than 15 times and it broke! Whenever we insert a disc into the machine, it would read ""no disc"". We called their service center and found out that it would cost [more] to fix it. In that case, we might as well get a brand new one!! But never Toshiba again! We're very disappointed at Toshiba's product quality."
1,WARNING - Class Action Suit,"See this site before considering Toshiba:http://www.dvdnotice.com/Like 80% of the reviews here, my player died within 18 months - after playing approximately 15-20 movies. Roll that in to the cost of renting/buying movies and you might as well be going to the movie theater!DO NOT BUY TOSHIBA."
1,Toshiba SD 2800 Do not buy this player,"I was using this player less than one year, and it stopped reading the disks. All it said was disk error on the display. I am having the same problem as everyone else who has had the player over a year. If you plan on getting a new one after only a year, this is a great player for you, otherwise do not by this player. Even though it is made by toshiba it is not a player that will last. Do not buy!!!!!!"
3,Okay,"The label was removed, so that was weird, but other than that it was how it was advertised. the pills are huge and hard to get down, but its okay, prob go with a powder next time."
1,Gives me horrible stomach aches,"This thing might be good for muscle growing, but it gives me horrible stomach aches.I have done a test and stopped taking it for 1 day. Aches were gone.Started taking it again, aches were back.I decided to throw it in the garbage."
3,"Fantastic for pre-workout, post, and ""hungry"" in between meals.","Noticeable difference after work (I'm on a 9-5 desk jockey) when I don't have dinner yet, to take 3-4 capsules then go to the gym. Post workout, pre, and during (if possible) has been fantastic. Its not a ""upper,"" rather, I recover quicker and ""activate"" energy quicker. So, this means, I don't take this and get energy, more like, a accentuate of when I actually get moving towards physical activity. This is my first BCAA foray, so, I can't comment on the product vs others. However, its cheap, and effective."
3,maltodextrin,"i thought i ordered some bcaa's but turns out its just maltodextrin with a little bcaa's on the side. serving size of 4 a little ridiculous, guess you get what you pay for."
4,These are good,"I take two of these before a workout along with the Glutamine Fuel and a caffeine tablet, a raspberry ketone pill and a green tea extract pill. I wash it down with some green tea. I take them about 6:00 am, on an empty stomach. I think the green tea helps my stomach from getting upset so early in the morning with them. I""m taking them to try to stave off the muscle catabolyzation that occurs when I exercise. I'm used to them and I would miss them if I didn't have them. I use the amazon subscription to order them and it lowers the price on them. Not a miracle pill, but a part of an overall health program. They are BCAA's so they are very good for you. I'm pleased with my purchase."
4,Works as Advertised,It is really handy to have the lancing device attached. The self feeding drum really makes it convenient. This is a large improvement over what was available only a few years back.
5,Accu-Chek Meter,"Was told I had high glucose level. So as I was waiting for my doctor to write a perscription for a meter and supplies,I purchased this one from amazon I wanted to know how bad my levels were. This meter is real simple to use .All you do is insert the drum of test stripes and when you turn it on the strip comes out with no toucing or handling the strips and with the turning off of the unit the strip ejects itself. The lancet pin is attached to the meter and the lancets are easy to use and painless. After checking my glucose levels they are in normal levels,both fasting and after meals.I do not believe I have any high sugar levels,maybe a mistake by the lab at the doctors office , I do not know,But so far everything is fine.this meter is perfect and very easy to use. Time will tell what will happen, but so far so good. This meter is perfect in my opinion."
3,Had to have replaced...,"The meter stopped working after the 5th use. Had to call the manufacture and wait until they sent replacement batteries even though I explained that we already tried two sets of new batteries. After installing the batteries that ACCU-CHECK sent, the meter still did not work. They sent a replacement meter after I called to inform them the batteries did not solve the problem. I like the product. Hoping this one does not stop working as well."
1,Not accurate for me,"I am not sure why. I read the reviews and researched carefully before making this purchase. I wanted accuracy, and all the reviews claimed that it was. It wasn't for me. My glucose level would fluctuate 30 points within a second according to the meter & I never even got close to the same reading twice. I am not diabetic & planned to use this for an at-home screening."
5,Great meter,This is my first meter. I read a lot of reviews because a lot of people complain about their meters not being accurate. I settled on this one. I took a reading one morning and then drove to the doctor for a blood test. The readings were identical. I'm also pleased with the ease of use of this meter. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
3,Average Meter,"I did a personal comparison of meters including Nova Max, Trueresult, Freestyle lite, Contour, One Touch ultra mini, Accu-chek, Embrace talking meter, Relion Prime, and Prodigy talking. My test was for 10 days and I took blood once a day for each meter (all tests were in the morning - fasting). I saw a lot of difference in the readings and judged my results from ease of use, price, result continuality, Of these meters the Accu-chek was just an average meter. The numbers seamed to fluctuate less that the other meters. The cost of the test strips are on the higher end. This test was done on my own so it was not done in a laboratory so my results are not scientific just my honest opinion."
3,Where's the drum?,"I have not had a chance to use the meter because it does not come with the drum. However if you call the company and are willing to put up with an idiotic robotic answering device they will ship you a pkg of three - without charge. I wasted a lot of time, and Amazon's, trying to find the missing drum and after receiving two kits without drums I called the company and got it straightened out."
2,Horribly imprecise.,"My reading was changing by 20 from the same drop of blood or from different drops of blood a minute apart. I have no idea how accurate it is seeing as I had nothing to compare it to, but the lack of precision made it worthless anyway so I didn't bother. I did the precision tests multiple times between two different drums so no, I didn't just get get a bad strip or two.The compact size was quite convenient. Reloading was easy."
1,Quit Working,"I'm not displeased with the product per se and I wouldn't know (as some other viewers stated) about it's accuracy (what am I suppose to do buy a bunch of meters and average the results?), HOWEVER, I used it about 8 times and then it was dark and wouldn't work. Thought the batteries that came with it might be old, so I bought some fresh ones. Still nothing. It worked 8 times and died? Wow."
3,an opinion,I was disappointed that the control solution and the test strips were not included in this purchase
3,Robert E. Lee airbrushed,"The author is a Virginian who actually laid eyes on General Lee. Unfortunately, he was taken in wholly by Lee's great charisma and he essentially writes as a Lee apologist. There is never a hint of any questionable decisions or conflicts with his staff. Gettysburg is dismissed as a tragedy occuring for reasons beyond Lee's control. Longstreet's disagreement with the location and plan of battle are never mentioned. I lost count of the number of times Cooke described Lee's physical appearance and bearing (handsome, unpretentious, and regal); Even his horse ""Traveller"" was handsome.Lee was probably the finest military officer ever produced by this country--no argument from me. I was hoping for more insight into his decisions at Gettysburg in particular but you'll not find that discussion here. If you Love Lee you'll love this book."
3,Not bad,"If you want to know about every time the general picked his nose or rode his horse this is a great book. Don't get me wrong, it's very good and entertaining but perhaps if it has a fault it is too detailed"
3,somewhat dissapointed,If you are looking for some balance in your Civil War readings then perhaps this book will help.The reader can not mistake the author's adoration of Lee. The General surely deserves the praise. I would have preferred to read more than just that. I was hoping to know the more of the man after getting to the end. The book could have conveyed the same message to me in about half the number of pages.
2,"Wonderful program, but flawed files...","Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox! I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase. Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end. Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality! So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!! 1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me."
4,"Download worked for me, but would like Linux support","The download process worked as advertised. I have a 3 megabit/s DSL connection, but the download still took more than an hour for a 25 minute episode. I was able to watch the movie on a Windows XP machine. Unfortunately, I mostly use Linux machines, and it does not seem possible to view these files under Linux. For this I subtract a star from the rating.Regarding the story, it is a fun story which is better than the usual Nickelodeon fare."
3,language & subtitle?,"hi! i'm a french buyer, someone could tell if in the third season box, french language & subtitle are available, before i bought! many thanks for the answer!!!!!!"
1,Why did they have to make this show?,I never liked this show from the start. The dialogue sucks and I hate the style that it's drawn in. Why can't they still make the good shows like Justice League and Batman: the Animated Series. I was thoroughly disappointed.
1,Not the discovery of the Titanic,"In 1981 Jack Grimm claimed to have found the Titanic, based upon fuzzy pictures of what might have been a propellor. This is the discovery from which the video takes it's claim. This DVD is as bad as that claim.For the real discovery get the National Geographic DVD of Dr Bob Ballard's 1985 expedition which located Titanic. This includes footage of the moment of discovery and underwater footage from deep dives to the wreck."
2,Way Too Hard,"I first played Blitz 2000 on a friends' N64, where I found it to be fun and moderately challenging. Then I bought it for the Playstation. What a difference! Whereas I could beat the N64 version on easy without even really sweating, I can barely beat the Playstation version on the same easy setting. The interceptions are out of control. And the computer seems to decide when it needs one. It really ceases to be fun because the AI is so out of wack."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I was extremely disappointed in this game. For one thing, it's 7-on-7, not 11-on-11. You don't have complete rosters, unlike other football games, and there is no running game per se. This is a passing league game. You might like it if you're 10 years old, but as an adult, I find it boring."
3,Better than the first,This a great game. They packed a wallop into this game. The only problem I have with it is it will not let me save my data.
2,Can you say INTERCEPTIONVILLE?,"This game would be great if it were a tad bit more FAIR. Graphics are great, sound is great, plays are ok, BUT, beware. If you get on a roll and start beating the computer too badly, it starts making incredible interceptions and fumble recoveries. It's real easy to throw 14 interceptions in one half and be behind 84 - 14. Case in point, Denver Vs. Tampa Bay. Poor Trent Dilfer could hit the water if he fell out of a boat. And the Defense will knock recievers off thier routes down field. A play could have a step on a DB and get knocked down just before he receives the ball. HOW LAME!"
2,No real improvements from the past one,Both are good but I expected this one to be an improvement from the past one.
2,Good for multi-players,"This game is exiting if played with other players. The game becomes awfully boring when playing alone. Highly recommend if playstation parties are your cup of tea, but for myself, i'm a single player and this game grew old fast"
2,Ridiculously UNFAIR,"This is a fun and exciting game that is very addicting. I wouldtell everyone to buy this it if it wasn't for one minor thing; NFLBlitz 2000 is absolutle unfair and will dirve any gamer crazy! One example is you end the first three quarters with a lead, and then with 30 seconds left in the 4th quarter, the ball in your possession, 1st down, by some ""miraculous force"" AKA absolutle unfairness the computer will some how make an interception. Now, with 20 seconds left, they will manage to score a touch down just so, as soon as they score the time just so happens to run out. This game will drive any gamer out of their mind!"
5,"Hello, Can I Get Some Protection Please!","Wham, Slam, in your face football game that puts all other games to shame. With audible bone crunching hits, the chance to set up your own plays, and fast paced gameplay, this latest installment in the NFL Blitz series will truly please all your senses and make you feel as part of the game. If you like no rules football or even football with rules you will truly love this game."
3,The worst game I ever played,It's the worst game in the world is because when you're in the lead like 35 to 14 in the 4th quarter the computer makes a come back from intercepting and fumbling from me.It gets very fustrating if you play it!
3,"Not a great Sim, but is a nice party game.","This game is not a nice arcade style Sim game at all. What I do like about the Blitz football games though is its ease of gameplay for most players. Anyone can pick this little game up and play it for a while. It to me makes a nice two player game. Pull it out when you got a few pals over your place and it makes for a good bit of fun. Dont try Blitz however if you are looking for a game to keep realistic seasons and stats, try Gameday if you are in that Market instead."
1,WAKE UP,This book was the greatest waste of time I have ever spent...I ask that the writer keep her day job.
2,Not very user friendly,The head is very difficult to get off if yu want to trim close. Even the adjustment is difficult.
2,Great Read But Where Are the WMD She Claims in the Book?,"I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable. After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq. However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction? As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, ""the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong,"" which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility. You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction."
4,America's worst enemy,This book is a factual account of the biological terrorism that has and is plaguing the United States for some time. I found the authors researched the subject with leaving no stones unturned. The depth with which the authors take the reader is astounding. I found myself asking why have we not taken the biological terrrorists attacks more seriously before September 11th??? The book gives great detail about these germs and the pains in which they have been chemcically engineered by militant terrorists groups. This type of terrorism seems so brutal and unforgiving. There are many factions holding on to germs for warfare. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the leading germ warfare.
1,As much propaganda as fact,"Miller and friends have written an easy-to-read, mass-market book on biological weapons. It is very focused on alleged biological weapons programs of other countries, without acknowledging our own dog in the fight. In other words, when I began to see Miller outline certain outrageous actions allegedly taken by the Russians or Iraqis, she omitted the fact that the US had taken the same actions, and worse. These glaring omissions made me question the purpose and intent of this book, as well as the ""facts"" presented. Indeed, it was as if Miller was beating the drum of war for the Bush Administration. The ""facts"" in this book are extremely slanted to the point of propaganda. As a scholar who has spent well over a decade studying biological and chemical weapons, I advise anyone who wants a truthful understanding of biological weapons, to avoid this book."
3,Fair,"Judith Miller is certainly an accomplished scientist, very well spoken and kinda cute but...Sorry, I can't say this fullfilled my wildest nighttime reading fantacies.As one reader suggested, I think that the author's timing was perfect for extra readership, otherwise I wonder if it would have been given the exposure.I purchase the book thinking it was more of a description ABOUT different biological agents, what they do, why they are used and where they come from(more Biology/germ science),and less about the lives of individuals in history that have effected (or tried to effect) the course of biological science.If that is what turns you on, you'll love it.Some of both are given,but (in my opinion), way too much DULL-very dull- personal/U.S. Department history narratives."
3,Infectious secrets,"""Germs"" is a shocking account of the secret biological warfare programs of the United States, Russia, and Iraq. The authors, talented journalists, rely on inside sources in and close to the U.S. government. The result -- in novelistic style -- is a page turner but not, unfortunately, a clear analysis of the key issues in the looming arms race in biological weapons.The authors essentially accept the rationale of the military for creating genetically engineered designer germs without probing hard enough whether these have value for defense -- or, as critics fear, only for offense."
2,Too Much Policy Wonking,"The first half of this book was fun, when they talk about the germs and the damage they can do. After the 1991 Gulf War, the book is endless handwringing about how to protect our soldiers and civilians. Forgettable luminaries are paraded across the page to come to the conclusion that America is at risk, but nobody really wants to spend any money."
3,There is a better book,"If you are interested in this, you should also look at what I believe to be a much more authoritative book--from the guy who used to head the Soviet's biological warfare program. That book came out some two years ago, but suddenly it's become more topical than ever. Forget about the media hyperbole and the talking heads, here is someone who really knows what he is talking about. His name is Ken Alibek, and his book is called Biohazard."
1,Miller's NYT reporting needs to be remembered,"Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for ""Judith Miller"" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims."
1,A Boring and Uninformative Book,"What these three authors are up to here is known in the trade as ""selling your notes."" This is a poorly organized, poorly written and boring account of a fascinating subject. Do not waste your money or your time.And yes, it's *that* Judith Miller."
3,"Writen for the lay-person, not someone in the field","I was somewhat disappointed after reading the credentials of the authors,I expected more.The information regarding basic microbiology was high school. Most of the book was about politicians and agenda rather than about the science. The title ""Germs"" made me suspicious of who the book audience was since noone in medicine uses the term. Nevertheless, is was a good general overview for someone with no previous knowledge on the subject which I'm sure is what it was intended for. I suppose I had placed higher expectations on it prior to reading."
5,Uses hundreds of interviews,"In the past decade the government has realized the U.S. is defenseless against the possibilities of germ weaponry, despite its leadership role in science and technology. This uses hundreds of interviews with scientists, intelligence officers and government officials to examine how new `bio-defenders' are dealing with the possibility of biological weapons. The history of such research and realizations is fascinating."
3,Very thick,"I found Germs to be an excellent book in terms of the detail it provided on the ""who's who"" and of past bio-chemical programs and events. The reading is dry and heavy with facts and figures, somewhat like an encyclopedia. I was disappointed not to hear more about the players in bio-chem terrorism in the Middle East, save for one chapter on Saddam. Seems like no one knew about the potential Taliban/Islam threat until September 11. Tell us....where do we go from here?"
5,A GREAT GAME!!!,This game is so great!All of the mazes and levels are so fun! you could play them over and over again. The graphics are great and you can see where you are going. The thing I most love about this game is that they have the old classic version which is fun and really great. I strongly recommend this game for anybody. You too mom's and dad's.By: 2 gamers 9 and 12
5,Ages 5 - 20?,"Come on, now! I'm more than twice twenty, and this would have to be my favourite PlayStation game! I'm old enough to remember the original PacMan. This is much better. Nostalgia has its place, but some things get better when brought up to date.The colour is great, the Quest is fun and holds interest, and the Mazes are fun, for kids and old-timers alike.Reasonably priced (as much as any video game can be called reasonably priced!) END"
4,Fun,"This is a fun game, pretty darn fun! For starters, you can play the original Pac-Man game, so that's an automatic awesome point. You also have various other 3D mazes to do whenever you want, so that's another good point! Sometimes the main story can seem a bit difficult, which may turn away some, but I don't really see much problem with it. I'd recommend this! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,The ever classic game of PAC-MAN takes a new twist,This PS1 game is great! There are tons of levels which will keep you occupied for a long time. It is really fun and addicting. Loved it and still continue to play it even after years!
5,Pac-Man World - A Great Game.,"My son (age 6) and I have played this game and had a great deal of fun with it. Took us a while to get to the final level (we just got our PS1 at Christmas), but this is a very good, clean, game for young children (and their parents--my husband and I both got caught up in helping ""beat the levels""). I would recommend to anyone."
5,My Favorite PS Game,"I have a PS2 now, but this wuz my 1st PS1 game along with Crash Warped (5 stars), Buzz Lightyear (1 star), and that's all I remember. But even with the PS2, this game never ends and never gets boring (except the outer space levels and I recommend it even though it's for PS1, especially at the cheap price it's sellin' fo'."
1,Pac-man world,I don't know because i have not recieved the game yet. I would like to know what the hold up is? Because i have already sent out payment about a month ago.Please e-mail me and let me know what the problem is.
4,"Very fun, but kind of short","This game was a lot of fun! The graphics were cool, the controls were tight, the camera didn't misbehave much and it was an overall joy to play. My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars, is that it was just too short. With only 15 levels and 6 bosses I beat the whole game in one weekend,(10-12 hours) so I'm not sure it's worth recommending a purchase. However if you're a huge Pac fan, or you're a little less experienced with these platformer type games then I think you'll find a highly enjoyable game for a reasonable price.Dan"
3,Cretinous splendor! (3 1/2 etoiles),"I pleaded with my God to bring me the Rock, and behold! it was so. For he delivereth unto me a Babylonian-by-way-of-Detroit ensemble for to bring me comfort in my drunkest hour. And lo--the singer sounds kinda like Lemmy, whilst the band rocks ala MC5 or the Stooges--yea, the very distillation of Rock. And the verses, and so the choruses, in their idiotic glory tell tales of excess and intoxicated stupor. And it was GOOD!And while it verily may be monotonous in its entirety--for the rock does not let up for a moment--yet it delivers according to the rules of the covenant. And the hills will tremble to the terrible sound: Unband brings the rock, forsooth!"
3,Excellent but don't buy,You can invisit your money in a bigger book. You can read this in your local library or book store.
3,"Good, but not great","The book's maps were very handy - we used them ALOT during our visit. The addresses were accurate - yet the reviews in the book were not. The ""antiques market"" at Clignacourt was nothing but a cheap flea market - VERY misleading according to the review in the book. A few other reviews were off as well. My personal suggestion is get a good pocket sized map of Paris like the one that comes with the book, but when it comes to reviews, get another source! However, you might want to spring for the book because aside from the faulty reviews, it did contain some enjoyable (and accurate) information regarding some of the major tourist sights of the town. Overall, I would buy it for the good map and enjoyable further reading about the Eiffel Tower and such, yet don't count on the reviews!"
4,top ten needs 20/20 vision,A really good series but the font size is too small for quick reading. All the information is accurate and well laid out however there are other such guides which due to their fold out components are able to use a larger more readable font.
2,"Better than nothing, but generally not up to par","This book does have some interesting details. But compared to other guidebooks or other books in the series, it is not as good. Some of the recommendations really seem questionable."
4,Portable,"Perfect for someone who would only be in Paris a day or three, this book specializes in giving you the highlights in a lightweight, compact book that is ideal to carry around with you when on the streets. The classic DK/Eyewitness travel guide for Paris covers so much material it is almost too heavy to carry around all day. I left the heavier guide in the hotel room, reading in the morning or evening about places we had been or were going, took this Top Ten guide out with us, along with the excellent Insight Fleximap, having put post-it-notes in the Top Ten guide if there was some additional data for the day (for example, the Top Ten guide mentions nothing about the Catacombs).This is not the book to get in depth historical or architectural information, but handy for use in the street."
5,White Oversize Block Plate,"Phat plates. I only use Mulberry plates in my home. Durable, and easy to clean. The screws tops don't check or mall when intalling the plates on the wall."
4,"Sucks you in, spits you out","I read this book in one day - it's about a young lesbian punk named Simone, and she is drawn into the world of her bizarre and messed-up friend, Cherry. After being her pawn and admiring her for years, things begin to break their friendship down once Cherry quits high school and becomes involved with a drug dealer.This book is a fast read and well-written. The plot isn't really strong, but it's a simple story, and there's lots of interesting elements thrown in - the punk scene, teenage prostitution, transgender teens, etc. It's well rounded.The thing about these people is I didn't really believe they were teenagers. They seemed older.Simone is a likable character, Cherry is repellant, Carlotta is fun, and Sexy Carol is captivating.Overall it's a good book."
3,chemical chaos,"this book was very captivating! i read the book through the night, i couldnt put it down. the author is not afraid to tell it like it is. its not the BEST book but its still very good and well written. extremely realistic and a breath of fresh air from all the little teen bopper books written by meg cabot and so on."
1,falls apart,this is the first toothbrush I have ever used that the bristles fall out of & stick in one's teeth.I don't recommend this one!
5,Natural Bristle Toobrush,"Excellent Toothbrush. Made perfect for cleaning your teeth. No harsh plastic brushes to slide over your teeth without cleaning it. This is the only way to ever brush your teeth. Use the one and only method for brushing, natural bristles toothbrushes."
2,"Good item, not what I ordered","I ordered what was written in the description & information of the product, and what I received was somethig different, with out any notification of a change what so ever. I also odered a 2nd item, that wasn't I included. Instead I got another one of the items I didn't order. Not a good experience at all, i would not recommend working with this seller, unless you want things you didn't wish to purchase."
5,Excellent information regarding Georgia's life,Well written book and excellent research. Enjoyed very much.
1,Trite,This is just awful. If you've never read a thing on O'Keeffe maybe you will learn something. Otherwise there is absolutely nothing new or interesting here. Not a thing.
5,"Outstanding Book, But Not For Beginners","I am about through the book now and it has been very rewarding. Be warned, this is not for the beginner or faint of heart, particularly the chapter on the HTTP Pipeline. But then if you have been to DevelopMentor you know the level.The concepts and code are covered masterfully and for the thinking programmer. Too many people write code without knowing the effects of that code or the possibilities open to them. Needless to say the inner plumbing of ASP.NET is covered very well. A lot of ""power-programmer"" techniques are illustrated.You must have a background in the .NET Framework and probably in ASP 3.0. There are a lot of changes from ASP 3.0 and the amount of transparency in the technology is unprecedented. Fritz takes full advantage of that. I don't have a lot of basis for comparison but I have not found anything better than this on ASP.NET."
3,"OK, but assumes ASP classic only ASP.Net itself","The book is OK, but it assumes that you are already very familiar with classic ASP. It also is very limited in its scope -- stricktly ASP.Net, eg. no ADO. It does go into architecture and event handling in good detail."
3,Essential but not advanced,"Having read previous reviews of this book, it sounded like it cut to the chase, no blurb or waffle. I was dissapointed to find that whilst it does go into a level of detail and is certainly not aimed at beginners, it lacks one thing. It does not go into advanced topics. You can certainly follow the a-b-c but when you want to take further, the d-e-f it doesn't give any pointers. Good for its size but by no means brilliant - I'm beginning to wish I'd bought asp.net unleashed."
1,Pure thoery...,"This is trainer's book, teaching you theories only. It does not have any 'Essential' and useful codes in it. What a disappointment and waste of money to buy this book."
4,Deep into the world of Subs,"'Submarines' by Admiral Hervey is a fantastic introduction into the technical side of submarines. The only reason it does not get five stars is because it is too short. This has got to be THE text for non-submariners ( Government employees, special forces commanders, defence chiefs). It details the essentials not only of operating, but also building and supporting a force of submarines. This book is packed with fact and measured personal opinion and experience.Probably too detailed for the average reader of submarine novels, this text does not concentrate solely upon the weapons and technical specifications, rather it focuses on how and why countries might use submarines effectively. This included the support required for the masts, propulsion and life support systems.The writing style is brisk and too the point. Easy to read, and easily understood by non-nautical types.Invaluable!"
1,yuck. I threw this away.,It smells nothing like rosemary. It smells like the strongest medicine that you can buy. I have no idea what you would use it for!
5,Well Worth the Few Extra Dollars,"Great Grandma offered to buy our son his Radio Flyer wagon for Christmas, so we started our research. We live in a neighborhood with lots of little kids, so we first looked around to see what kind of wagons our neighbors have. We also looked on-line and at the stores at the different styles. The toy stores around us do not carry the All-Terrain wagon - only the plastic ones. We decided to take a chance and order it sight unseen. We are so happy we did. Althought it said it would take several weeks to arrive, five days later it was delivered to our door step. Assembly was easy, and our son loves it. Many of the neighbors have the plastic ones because of the seat backs, but our son, who is well under the suggested age, has no problems at all. Plus, the all-terrain makes pulling the wagon easier, and makes our son's ride smoother."
5,Childhood revisted,"This Radio Flyer is great, just as I remembered when I was a kid pulling my wagon everywhere I went. And later pulling behind my bike like a truck and trailer, these were good times. Know almost 35 years later it was time to get another wagon to help me around yard and for hauling all the stuff to the beach and the park. And is also a fun project to customize."
2,Poor quality control,"Initially, we ordered the more expensive all wood version of this wagon. It arrived with a large piece of wood chipped off the corner and lots of wood filler throughout the wagon. Cheap cheap cheap.So we tried this wagon, twice. The first time, it had lots of dents in the bottom because the wheels were smashed into it when it was shipped. This one arrived in a plain, cardboard box, making us think it was re-packaged.We exchanged it for another, only to get one with a large paint chip on the top lip of the wagon, exposing the steel. The second one came shipped in a radio-flyer box, which tipped us off that the first one was probably re-packaged.Sure, eventually the wagons will probably be dented or chipped, but if you're spending the money, you want something that was quality controlled."
4,Off-gassing,"The wagon is beautiful and my 19-month old son loves it. But it's off-gassing a chemical smell horribly. It arrived at least 2 weeks before Christmas, and filled our guest bedroom with the off-gas from within the box. We finished the assembly, put it in the barn and brought it in early on Christmas morning. I could smell the off-gas on my son's breath when I put him to bed that night and our whole house was filled with the smell (and we have 12 foot ceilings downstairs!). There is no email-in contact for Radio Flyer, but I'll call them tomorrow. Just thought people should know. Wonder if Amazon could do something?"
3,Good wagon but smelly.,"This wagon is so much fun, it's really too bad it stinks so badly. I guess it's the rubber from the tires. The smell is overpowering and there's no way I could use it until it aired out for about a month outside. It's still bad but usable now. It's made well otherwise though and the kids love it."
4,Cool wagon!,Everything is good except the wood paneling is a little thin but it is a kids wagon so no big deal.
4,Broken rails,We were thrilled to receive this gift! We have a home in the country as well as the city so were anxious to assemble and get outside with our twins. Unfortunately all four wooden rail sides were broken. We now are trying to return but very disappointed in the construction of the sides. We hope the exchange process is easy and quick. We would like to give it another try.
5,Love This Wagon,This wagon is highly recommended to anyone with children. It is a great wagon to pull them around while strolling the neighborhood or loading the kids up to tote other items for beach trips. It is durable and functional. Probably the best item we have purchased for our son thus far.
3,"For the price, expected USA made","First , upon opening the the box, it stunk. I mean it reeked, Later, determined to be air filled tires. It had to air out a week before use. One wheel/tire assembly wouldn't hold air. RF Customer Service is great, sent a complete wheel/tire (didn't stink quite as bad) with new hubcap although the hubcap was black and original was red. No problem, they'd sent 6 in original package. As noted above, for +$180.00, I expected USA manufacture. Instructions were clear and precise. Would possibly buy again except for Chinese manufacturing."
5,Excellent Buy!!,If you are looking for a good wagon to last a long time buy this one!! I couldn't be more satisfied. My husband put it together and he didn't have a hard time at all he just took his time and it went great!! The Free Shipping made it even better but pay the price it is worth every penny!!
4,Woody Wagon,"Bought the ""Woody Wagon"" for my year and a half old granddaughter to cruz around in at carshows with grandpa as the horsepower. Wagon needed a little customizing with some neat car related stickers, added a padded seat and white lettering on the tires! We took it on a test run around the neighborhood, it rolled real easy and rode smooth with the big air tires. She loves it!! It'll be great as carshow season is coming up soon. Buttt it's to big to fit in the back of grandpas 'cuda, so I guess it'll be up to grandma to get it there!!!! Also really great price when I bought it."
5,Great gift for the new baby to grow with.,"Radio Flyer is wonderful gift for the new baby.I've bought three of them.Now that the grand son is 2 years old,we take him out when we go walking.We carry his diapers,a little ice chest and other goodies for our little walkie.When he gets tired of walking,he gets in the Radio Flyer and is very happy ridding in this great little red wagon,.called ""Radio Flyer"".Thanks amazon,When am I going to get free shipping??? RJ So. Calif."
2,Awesome Wagon,"I'm really glad that we bought the All-Terrian Steel Wagon for my 1 year old. Not only do we love it, but she loves riding in it as well. My husband and I wanted something that would grow with her over the years and not require batteries. Everyone loves a radio flyer wagon and has memories of childhood with one of these. It was worth the money because it will serve her for years to come."
2,nice wagon if you get over the smell of the tires!,"We received this wagon and did not open it right away...waiting for a nice day. Well, holy cow! When I opened the box I thought it was packed with moth balls or some other terrible chemical! Even the inner box was bad! I took everything out and come to find that it is the tires that have this horrific smell...been sitting in garage now for 2 weeks hoping it settles before we put it together, but no the entire garage smells and it has no sign of lowering it's strength! Not sure what to do at this moment. Fiance says it is just tire smell...well I don't know what other tires smell this way, but I have never smelled it before! Seriously YUCK!"
5,Great wagon!,"I did several searches and read many reviews before deciding to buy this wagon. I had it narrowed down to this one and the John Deere w/sides. I went with the Radio Flyer because I really wanted the durable sides and steel construction. I also needed the All Terrain Wheels for our country property. My son is too little to pull it himself, but has five older cousins who love to take turns hauling it around. It has held up very well. It pulls through sand, dirt, over small rocks, up little hills, over curbs (mowstrips), through grass and gravel lined driveways. I am impressed with the ease of use. It has carried around six different children, toys, rocks, and the occasional dog and is still in great condition. (It is 9 months old). I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nostalgic, durable, toy wagon."
5,Every Kid Should Have A Radio Flyer Wagon,"Our 2 year just got this wagon for Christmas, she loved it, and sat happily and comfortable in it our whole walk. My husband pulled the wagon and just for fun I got in with my daughter, the wagon handled my weight (120lbs) just fine! My husband said it turns and pulls so smoothly, we went over all sorts of terrain including, sand, rocks and grass, it worked fantastic, smooth ride the whole time. There is so much room we had all sorts of toys in there and my daughter was very comfortable, also I fit in it, not too cramped! Assembly was a breeze too. This wagon is awesome, I think every child should have one, way more fun than a stroller! Get one!"
3,LOVE but be ready to REPAIR!!,"Love but lost a few KEY bolts after 2 trips to the beach...Not claiming to be handy woman but can put together basic toys/furniture!! Apparently the vibration of the trip to the beach is more then the average handywoman can handle! Word to the wise, get something to hold the bolhs together longer then the kids cry! Iv'e repalced 4 since 7.4.11! On the plus side, my 2 year old knows what a nut and bolt are - We've got to fix the wagon! 4 of 10"
4,Radio Flyer all terrain wagon,"Radio Flyer wagon came from Amazon.com promptly. One of the wooden sides was broken. Most likley caused by the wood drying out after construction, not a shipping issue. A little wood glue and all is well. Off road tires make the wagon very versatile. My 18 month old son loves it. Good purchase"
4,Grand kids love it,Not as heavy gauge as the one I had as a kid. But it is what it is. Made in CHINA
4,very sturdy,"Impressed with the quality - its not the old 1970's ""solid as can be"" version, but still put together well. Tires are good for going on grass. Love the anti-tip over handle/front wheel set up. We have used it for our 3 year old to play in/with and to haul things around the garden (including 100 lbs. of bricks - would not recommend do that too many times :) If you are going to leave it outside, seal the wooden sides with urethane, or they will get a ""weathered"" look"
1,Cheaply made product from Chine,These wagon's used to be made solid and heavy. Not any more. They are made of cheap stamped tin. I mean the wheel's do not even screw on any mroe like previous models. They have a press on cap to hold the wheel. BAD IDEA! The wood on the one I purchased from 8 years ago was almost 1/2 inch think. This wood is 1/4 inch thick and will not last long to a child's abuse. Just purely a cheap product!!
5,One super wagon,Bought as a Christmas gift for two grandchildren. I assembeled it at there home it was hidden in the garage. And bought in by there dad on Christmas moring as the last present that santa had dropped off. Both grandchildren were pulling it around in the house till there dad said it was an outside toy. assembly was a breeze!!
4,Just what I expected,"I purchased this wagon for my granddaughter. I anticipate using it instead if a stroller at times, and am looking forward to seeing her play in it."
1,Horrible,"When I opened the box, the smell was so staggering, we thought we had a gas leak in the house. Wagon was poorly packed and damaged. Couldn't even leave it in the house while I waited to return it, the smell was so bad. Not a regular rubber smell at all. Garbage. Seeking a better option? Try a Berlin-Flyer. Daughter loves it."
5,good 'ol wagon,"Nice wagon, well built, traditional looks, inflatable tires. THE TIRES do stink tho, they smell like rubber chemicals pretty bad, so if you can, assemble it outside and let it air out."
4,Red Wagon Memories,We buy a Radio Flyer for all of the nieces and nephews on their 1st birthday. They have a ball in them for about 5 or 6 years and then it becomes a great hauler of stuff when they go on vacation. If you need a gift for a toddler these are GREAT!!!
1,Not american Made,"I'm shopping tonight for my 14 month old daughter. Her first wagon. Very excited to check out Radio Flyer wagons. Well, till I found out it's made in China. But that's OK because ""We're still a Chicago company. We're still a Chicago brand,"" Yea, I don't think so. Do us all a favor and support American made. Look for the other ""Flyer"" on Amazon that's made in America."
1,Missing pieces,"The wagon would have been great and easy to set up IF it wasn't missing a couple of nuts and bolts. I know my daughter will like it, as soon as we can use it. Hopefully amazon.com will send me the missing pieces so I can actually use the wagon."
1,"Great Toy, But Too Big",I bought this wagon because my son is four and is 40 pounds and 40 inches tall. Too big for a stroller and too small for long hikes or long walks. I took the measurements off Amazon. I went to the Radio Flyer Website and got the measurements from their website too. I have a VW Jetta so I wanted to make sure the wagon would fit in my trunk without too much trouble. My son and I were really excited when we got this wagon and I spent two hours putting it together only to realize that IT DIDN'T FIT IN THE TRUNK!!! My son and I were really disappointed and have yet to find a wagon that is all terrain and will fit in the trunk...anyone have any ideas???This was a huge bummer. Don't trust the measurements.
3,ATW Radio Flyer Wagon,"Overall, I liked the wagon, however, it arrived damaged. A piece of the wood that made up the stake body had a piece broken out, and the one side of the medal wagon bed was dented. Regarding the wagons construction, the part where the handle fastens to the wagons tongue amd the wagon tongue itself is made of very flemsey medal."
5,Wagon for 18 mo. old grandson,"My grandson loves to go for a ride in his wagon. The sides make very safe. He is not tall enough to get in and out alone, to be considered. The wagon is very well made. You will want to keep outside for awhile as tires do have strong smell of rubber (chemical) like smell when new."
2,Missing parts,"With all the positive reviews, I decided to order this wagon.Unfortunately, it arrived missing vital parts. Amazon's return process was excellent, however, physically returning the wagon was a hassle because it is heavy and bulky.Radio Flyer shifted their manufacturing to China a few years ago, and my experience with this wagon is proof of the negative impact that move has had on their products."
4,Great wagon but...,"I bought this all terrain wagon for my grandson's birthday - needed something sturdy and durable to withstand Vermont's mud and snow seasons. It's a great wagon with two exceptions: Two of the tires were flat when we took the parts out of the carton and it has a very strong chemical odor. I washed it down with an eco friendly cleaner but even with 2 washings the smell was still incredibly strong. I'm hoping once the wagon is outside for a day or two the smell will dissipate. But, even with those two problems I'm happy with this wagon and my grandson was delighted."
3,Smelly!!!!,"First off, This wagon functions well. The steering is good and the sides are high enough to contain children and gear. The wagon arrived with a piece of the wooden side broken. It was easily repaired with wood glue. After 3 weeks, another wood piece broke. I'm willing to blame this on bad shipping and wear and tear. The big issue with this wagon is the smell! It smells so bad that I can smell it in the garage from the house. When we had it in the car on a long drive, we had to stop and buy giant garbage bags to wrap it in to contain the noxious fumes. Finally after 2 months, the smell is just starting to fade. I feel anxious about putting my toddler in something that smells like brain damage."
5,What a super updgrade from 25 years ago,"25 years ago, I bought a classic Radio Flyer wagon for our daughter. It was exactly the same as what I had as a child. Although it is all rusty now, we still use it for hauling things around when doing yard work. For my grandsons I decided that I wanted an upgrade of the classic style, because I know that my daughter will eventually use it for other things besides hauling her kids around. The big tires are great. No more clunking every time the wheels hit a crack in the sidewalk, and it is so easy to pull through the grass at the park. Eventually, the sides will come off and it will be used for the yard while gardening. Unlike mine, it won't get stuck in the holes of the rough terrain when hauling bags of dirt and potted flowers. A perfect investment that my daughter will have for the rest of her life."
5,wagon,"My son loves this wagon. I'm very happy that I bought the all-terrain wagon because the wheels are really big and go through grass easily. I would recommend getting the cushions that go with the wagon, much more comfortable for the little ones."
5,High Quality Wagon,"My mother insisted that we have this specific model of the Radio Flyer wagons because of her good experience with the one she owns. She was absolutely right! Not only is it made of high quality materials, but the large all-terrain tires are a must-have! They handle every type of terrain and are great for going up and down street curbs. The wood panels provide extra safety and security for little ones, and when paired with the Radio Flyer pads and side pads (also available on Amazon), it makes for a comfortable and safe ride for your little explorer. My son LOVES going for rides around the cul-de-sac and is learning a lot about cause 'n effect and movement by pushing and pulling the wagon and watching the tires move with him. I highly recommend purchasing this model!"
5,Radio Flyer ATW,What a beautiful vehicle ! Well made and I expect my grandchildren will have years and years of fun with it.
4,Very bright and easy to see,"I've used this possession arrow about 10 times since I got it. Its very bright - easy to see from anywhere in the gym. The cord is nice and long (about 6 ft, I think). It seems like its well made. I have two minor issues with it. 1) there's no ""nuetral"" area to put the switch prior to the start of the game. 2) the depth of the unit is only about 2 inches at most on the bottom, so its fairly easy to knock over if its bumped. All in all though its a good possession arrow."
4,Night on Fear Mountain (Black Belt Club),"As a former educator and parent to a 9 year Karate student I was touched by this story. Like the previous book, ""Seven Wheels of Power"" we are reaquaiinted with Max and his fellow Black Belt Club members. Max is still struggling with self-confidence and low-self esteem, and through his journey he learns to listen to his positive self rather than his doubting fears.What I liked most about the story was the message that we shouldn't let fear make our choices for us. This is something my daughter has been dealing with a lot, and after reading the story she was a able to get a better perspective as to what ""working through it"", ""move past it"" or ""trusting yourself"" truly means.These books were an adventure to read and we both look forward to reading the next book."
5,Great Cat Book!,"What a great cat book! Features 99 cat lives, terrific color photos, paintings, and drawings, and fine commentary. Features practically every conceivable (domestic) cat throught the ages, and will provide fun, entertainment, and education for years to come!"
2,Lack of structure foils potential,"It was with great anticipation that I awaited my copy of this book by former NBC censor William G. Clotworthy. However, I was quite disappointed. While the work is rife with information and anecdotes about Mr. Clotworthy's work at NBC, and in particular on Saturday Night Live, the lack of an index - or, for that matter, chapters - made it nearly impossible to navigate and rendered virtually worthless as a difinitive reference book. My advice is to invest in a pack of Post-It notes upon purchase. That said, the book is well written and a quick read. And a note of thanks to its publisher 1st Books for taking the care to get this book to the public. Without their help, it's quite possible that this book would have only existed in manuscript form in Mr. Clotworthy's desk drawer."
1,DVD dead in a year,"This ""COMBO"" quickly becomes a ""SOLO"" vhs player. The tape player is great. The DVD started skipping from time to time after a few months, then competely died after about a year. Won't even play pristine DVDs. Junk."
2,terrible manual,"The dvd player kept giving the message..""disk error"" and I have no idea what is wrong. I tried several disks including new ones and the same error. The manual does not help. tried getting help on line???? Does anyone knows why and what I have to do??? Help"
2,Remote,"It seems easy enough to hook up, but the remote is not a universal remote. It would be a better product if the remote was universal. Who in this day and age uses more than 1 remote to control a TV and VCR?"
2,A great step backward,"It plays tapes and it plays DVDs. That's where the convenience ends:--terrible manual--NON universal remote, and good luck finding one that will work this thing.--If you're old enough to remember how we had to program a timer reconding back in the late '70s, you'll feel nostalgic: Want to record something on channel 342? You'll start at channel 2 and have to hold down the + button on the remote for a couple hours, because it ignores the remote's number pad!I'm going to take this one back and see if the Samsung V2000 is any better."
2,Warning...Do not buy this combo unit,"I purchase this vcr/dvd combo today and was disappointed. My first dvd movie suddenly paused without warning...I could not start my movie and had to exit all together. Second, use of the remote control was frustrating. Save yourself some headaches...do not purchase. I'm returning my purchase tomorrow."
4,Solid and quiet,"I bought the SDV280 after returning a similar competing product (reviewed elsewhere). I can't comment on reliability, but so far I'm pleased with the DVD playback quality. The disc drive is quiet and the tray has a good, solid feeling when it comes scooting out. The remote is very responsive and has separate pairs of buttons for FF/Rew and Skip Forward/Back. As others have pointed out, however, it is not a universal remote.One gotcha with this unit, as with other combos, is that it does not necessarily free up an input on your TV. If you use just the RCA connections, you can play both DVD and VCR on one input (the Toshiba does the necessary switching), but if you use S-Video for the DVD, you need to plug the VCR into the second set of RCA jacks; it won't play on the first. That's the case with my TV anyway, and it means threading the VCR cables around to the front of the TV, which is not completely satisfactory."
1,Broken after 6 Weeks,"Thought it was great, bought it as a Father's Day present. Then, only about 6 weeks after receiving it, the power supply didn't work at all. Amazon wouldn't take it back. Toshiba directed me to take it to an authorized dealer. I did, and they held it a month, then gave it back to me unrepaired, saying that ""failure is typical of lightning or power surge."" There was no storm. There was also no warning on the box that a surge protector might be needed for the product. I am told that this is not covered under the warranty! If Amazon won't stand behind this product, and Toshiba won't either, I don't think it's worth buying. As a student, I don't appreciate being ripped off of this much money."
1,Think twice before you buy this combo!,"Eight months after purchasing this combo, the vhs side quit showing a picture. I took it to the service center where they charged... just to look at it... The warranty is 3 months parts and labor and 1 year parts. It is a worthless warranty. Don't buy this unless you plan to buy another one in less than a year!"
1,Remote falsely advertised as multibrand,"I have been a loyal Toshiba buyer, but, no more! After extensively reviewing this combo unit at several web sites including the Toshiba corporate site, I decided to purchase it. I was excited that I was able to tie the unit into my audio reciever. I was disappointed to find that this model does not come with a multibrand remote. It is advertied by Toshiba as having a mulitbrand remote (to control other brand tv's and so fourth) but it does not. The remote only works the unit itself it will not control my Toshiba TV or any other brand TV for that matter. My 8 year old Hitachi VCR even came with a multibrand remote. I questioned Toshiba customer support and they were rude and directed me to their web site's disclaimer about not being responsible for changes in fetures from advertised product, bla bla bla. I am all done with Toshiba. I will be returning this for a Sony that actually has this feature."
4,Works great,"I've had it for about three weeks now and it works great. Plays mp3 (from cd-r). Vcr works good too. I haven't tried to play dvd-r yet, but my new pc with the dvd-r writer is in route :) So we shall see if it will work. A real space saver too. It is the same size as my old sony vcr alone."
1,Worst Electronic Item I Ever Bought - Complete Junk,"I bought this thing for our bedroom, so my wife and I could watch both kinds of media on the TV and listen to the occasional CD, or plant our kids in there so they can watch a Disney DVD while we do something else around the house. What a piece of junk! Within a couple of months the remote stopped working, new batteries didn't help. I bought a replacement remote; still no joy. It turns out the sensor on the unit (not the remote) stopped receiving the signal. That's especially bad on this unit since there's no control on the unit that lets you get to the menu on a DVD (big problem with most Disney videos). This unit is worthless. I junked it and bought a Sony combo instead - that one works great. No more Toshiba for me, ever."
3,No Progressive Scan technology.,Do not buy a DVD-player without progressive scan; most TV-makers are switching to exclusively making digital TVs and it is a must have feature. Unless you just want this for an year and then will upgrade to a progressive scan DVD player.
2,Does not work with Lumix DMC FZ40,"I had high hopes for this converter as my only other Raynox product, the DCR-250 macro converter is absolutely awesome.This arrived well packaged & looked a sturdy well constructed lens, however, when I have experimented using it with my Lumix FZ40, I gain no additional wide angle advantage at all once I have either zoomed the lens to remove the vignetting, or cropped the vignetting from the image. The end result is exactly the same as the images taken with the camera's 24mm lens at its widest angle without the converter - with the addition of a little distortion. I am sure this would work well with a 50mm lens but with the Lumix it is a waste of $90."
2,Lenses too large,"Despite the description ""Medium Avaitor Sunglasses"", the lens size is exactly the same size as Large Aviator Sunglasses. It would be really useful if the lens size included as part of sunglass product descriptions. Having to order the glasses to find out the true size is not efficient.Other than the size issue, I love Driver lenses in general and will keep trying to find the smaller lens version."
2,sunglasses,Not as sturdy as glasses that I have bought in the past .I have worn Serengeti sunglasses for over 15 years these are not the same as the previous glasses purchased .
3,Not dark enough,"I purchased the large version of the aviators from Serengeti first and they were too big. I tried to go down a size and get the medium aviators. The sunglasses fit ok, but not great. I previously had the ray-ban aviators and they fit better. I wore the sunglasses a couple times and every time I had to squint while wearing them because it let in so much light. I do have pretty sensitive eyes to the sun and these just weren't dark enough. I'm trying Vedalho HD once before I go back to the reliable ray-bans."
3,They're ok,I ordered the medium size and they came pronto - but they are not what I thought they would be. They don't want to stay on my face very well and I'm just not that impressed. I can see through them fine. I have nothing against the optics - just the fit.
2,if you are wondering whether to get this or not...,"*grin*....well, don't be deluded by the wonderful synonpsis.i picked this novel, attracted by the bluburb on its back. but it proved to be a disappointment. supposedly, we have a tale of james lawson who is sent to singlehandedly stop an intergalactic war. but the novel turned out to be quite unlike the space sci-fi adventure i was expecting.the first half of the story is written from a third person viewpoint so i felt very removed from the james lawson character. the next half, an abrupt shift occurs in the story and we start getting to know the characters better.this seems to me to be a book full of great ideas but poorly written. perhaps the fault of the collaboration.try this book if you really wish, and with lower expectations, this tale can be better enjoyed."
2,Falls short of the orginal.,"I hesitated a long time before buying this book, doubting that it could add anything to the great short story by Eric Frank Russel it was based on. Eventually I decided to buy it anyway because I loved the short story so very much and in years of searching had not been able to get a copy of the original which I had borrowed from a friend.Though all elements of the orginal story where there, what I feared was proven right, the extension from short story to novel became boring. The lengthening of the story without really adding anything to it made it awkward rather than captivating and in the end I paged to the latter fourth of the book, no longer able to finish it.The sad thing about it all is that it's not a bad story, just one that does not manage to capture the grandeur of the original. My advice: If you read the orginal story, don't read this one, try to get hold of one of the `flinx' books instead which are far more worthwhile."
2,"Great Day, Schmait Day. Who Cares?","Slightly entertaining, but the plot is old and weak. There are no surprises here. This novel a real bomb, and is not worth the time it takes to read."
2,"Good idea, poor execution.",I have been a avid fan of Foster's older works and bought this book despite the poor reviews posted here. I wish I would have paid attention to them. Try any of Foster's books published before 1995 instead of this one.
1,Justifies interference with others affairs with force.,"I found the protagonist to be unappealing, justifying his interference in the affairs of others as 'might makes right'. Nice, bland, warm, fuzzy, universe, not up to Mr. Fosters better works."
3,Too expensive,"This item is way over-priced. If it was not required reading for Freshman Social Studies, I would not have purchased it. Will re-sell when the course is finished."
3,"Play it again, Misha","One man, two loves. A good old-fashioned triangle. That's basically the gist of this book.Tall, dark, and handsome pianist Misha Levin can't make up his mind between his devoted wife, Vera Bunim-Levin or his photographer girlfriend Serena Gibbons. Vera tries her damndest to be what any man could ever want in a partner, but the sex with Serena is like nothing Misha has ever experienced. Should he throw what he and Vera have away for a relationship that may or may not work beyond the bedroom?The characters aren't completely cardboard, but they aren't as dimensional as they could be. It's understandable, though-- they're too busy having sex to bother about developing a multi-faceted personality. Not complaining, though. Just sayin'.Rhapsody isn't Great Literature or anything, only a romantic novel. A decent book of its kind, enjoyed while it lasts, yet ultimately to be read and forgotten."
4,Good story,I thought it was a good sci-fi story. I thought the characters were good but I felt the ending was rushed and it was somewhat predictable.
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I was hoping for freshness and originality in this novel because it features gay sorcerers whose magic depends on sex, which is a plot device I haven't come across very often. However, I found the plot to be ordinary and sparse. I felt that the characters were all the same; handsome, horny, intelligent, amiable. It was hard for me to tell them apart. Also, I felt that the language Fox used was too precious, if you know what I mean. Words and phrases like ""handsome youths"", ""godlike"", and ""magnificent body"", were used constantly, and everyone was always kissing tenderly, caressing gently. I felt the sex scenes could have been much more arousing, but, as I said, the characters were interchangeable and the writing was cliche; all the sex acts seemed the same. I would have liked to see different acts associated with individual spells, for example. All in all, I was disappointed with the book, although if you want a quick, easy read with lots of explicit sex, this is your book."
2,Poor reference. Author uses book as a promotion for others,"This book does a good job explaining the relationship between broker and client, property characteristics and some other subjects. However, the book does a poor job explaining the ins and outs of financing from the different programs to how exactly points with a mortgage broker work. I just recently purchased a house and this was to be my sole reference, however, I had to seek out answers on the Internet for most of my financing questions. Several times during this book the author explains that in order to have a more in depth explanation about a particular subject, you need to purchase his book on ""negotiating"", or ""financing"" . The book also was inaccurate and spoke negatively about government financing programs such as FHA/HUD loans and VA loans. I used VA financing for my purchase and the explanation and details in the book were inadequate. If you purchase this book, do not expect it to answer the majority of your questions."
5,Great read for a first time homebuyer!,Reading this book made the process of buying my first home much easier. It was an easy read and gave me a solid understanding of what I needed to know when I started shopping.
4,Useful and Simple,"The book is written very well its simple, I havent tested its usefulness because I havent baught a home as yet. However If you want to save money all this information is available on the web (ie. if you have the time to look around). Its Very very easy to read and understand and forewarns you about most mistakes you are likely to make."
5,congratulations mr bakker,"Mr. Bakker presents many incredibly obvious arguments in this book. Most of his reasoning is flawless, and while many call it deviating too far from old-fashioned ideas, the plain truth is that in many places the conventional ideas were just wrong and needed to be corrected. The only major mistake in the book is Mr Bakker's assertion of the weakness of Tyrannosaurus' front limbs. In more recent findings it has been discovered that the front limb's were actually much shorter than previously believed and much stronger. In fact, most tyrannosaurs could probably bench-press about three hundred pounds or more. Aside from that one misunderstanding, however, the book rates five stars in my view."
5,simply perfect,"Robert T. Bakker has been an inspiration all of my life. As a PBS child obsessed with dinosaurs, I saw him regularly on T.V. This book supurbly establishes a basis for all of his views on dinosaur physiology based on not only the facts he has discovered in his brilliant and acclaimed career, but on the work of countless other paleontologists. It is a great read as well. It is not dull and plodding like some sort of manual, but filled with information that is interesting and enjoying to read. The illustrations done by the author are flawless as well. This book is perfect for anyone with even a passing interest in paleontology."
5,Caen los viejos estandartes...,"Soy paleoilustrador... y siempre he tenido una vision muy critica en lo que se refiere a la imagen del dinosaurio como especie biologica, que hemos soportado por siglos. Robert Bakker nos abre los ojos con una especie llave inglesa gigantesca con esta obra, a pesar de que fue escrita tiempo atras, los textos se mantienen casi vigentes en la mente colectiva de los mas atrevidos, de los que no aceptamos nunca a los dinosaurios como torpes animales victimas de su propia fisiologia.A Bakker lo odias o lo amas mucho, ya que te explica cada hipotesis, cada teoria en un lenguage muy coloquial, muy ameno y grafico, que al final te sientes tentado a creerle hasta las mas descabelladas."
5,High Tech Delight,"This is one of those books that once you sit down and begin, you don't want to put it down. The high tech premise is so current and so believable that you wonder if the book is really fiction. I finished the book in two sittings and now I can't wait to for the authors next book. This one begs for a next installment, and another, and another."
2,This machine will be great when the bugs are fixed,"The concept/design of this machine is absolutely brilliant. However, I believe HP released it before it was quite ready for prime time. Many of the issues have been documented in other reviews, so I won't repeat them here, but thought you might be interested in a conversation I had with local BestBuy tech person the other day. I noticed that they didn't have a D135 on display and casually inquired about their experience with it. He said that overall it was good but they were getting a lot of returns because the print heads are wearing out a LOT sooner than they should according to spec. He said it looks like a manufacturing problem that they will hopefully have fixed soon."
3,Nice but flawed,"...The d135 looks good and has some very attractive functionality for a small office. However, a few users may want to watch out with the document feeder which is really only barely designed to handle anything other than standard sheets. I produce my own business stationary on the fly and need to feed through a big variety of envelopes, labels, forms, etc. The Feeder is hard to change, difficult to access, and chews up some stuff at random. For instance, the envelope slot creates folds and wrinkles about 30% of the time...One other ""buyer beware"". For those of you who do not have a USB port, the d135 does NOT come with a serial port connection. You have to order the plug separately - it is an option, assuming it is available which it wasn't when I bought 3/02."
1,Less and Less Ink Per Cartage over time. We print the same thing over and over...,"We print the same layout of a flyer going to homes with very little change over the last 3 years. Now HP even added a download that just STOPS you from using the cartage when it ""empty"" Plus it always resets it self back to full cartage use each time you go to print. Fax has never worked if you try more than 1 sheet of paper. Also it Scan to Button has never worked. We have bought Brother products with less problems. No more HP printers!"
2,pain to install,"I previously had a 900 series installed on WindowsXP. As of this writing, I still do not have the D135 installed. It supposedly has a built-in script to uninstall your 900 series but it balks and does not uninstall and I cannot install the drivers for the D135."
1,"Printer is on life support...transplant, please","I've been using my friend's HP D135 for 3 months now. It wheezes, spits, groans and has bad jets (which can be replaced for a ridiculous amount of money). The chronic seizures that occur when scanning are particularly irritating. I largely bypass this ""terminal"" piece of junk for another HP gem...the paper-jamming HP Laserjet 6L. This thing is about as healthy as Dick Cheney. Don't buy it unless you are into hospice care for badly made computer related products."
4,Good multi-function device,"We've had this printer/scanner/fax for about 14 months and are satisfied with it. It is connected to our network and is our primary printer. It has also replaced our copier, fax and scanner."
1,Mac users beware!!!!,This uses the same software as all the other useless HP all-in-ones that have come down the pike. Constant crashes and nothing but problems. Be prepared to spend alot of time on the phne with tech support
5,"MAGNIFICENT, SUPERB PRINTER","This printer, in nothing short of magnificent. I can't say enough good words about, it would be an owners dream printer, some thing to be real proud of, and to show off to all your friends. Every one knows that Hewlett Packard is number ( ONE )"
2,Lousy Customer Service Sours O.K. Machine,"Out of the box, this piece of junk spent almost two hours ""initializing,"" which seemed a BIT excessive give the literature provided, but I could easily have spent even LONGER on hold with HP's customer service line, which isn't even a toll free number! Hopefully if you buy this device it'll work right out of the box for you, otherwise you're screwed."
2,d135 becomes a paperweight over time.,This was a pretty good all round product for my home office but I didn't last 2 years before I ran into problems. After the third year it became only a printer. The scanner/copier functions failed. I would expect a longer life out of these products but not to be.
3,get something more reliable,This printer has some cookl features but I have had nothing but problems with it. Thankfully I bought the service plan through Best Buy because it has been in for service twice. I had to replace the print heads the first time and this last time it just died. Best Buy wouldn't repair it so they replaced if for a MUCH nicer multi function printer. I can't wait to try it!!
1,I was happy with it for about 2 months until ..,"things starting breaking. It constantly displays ""scanner failure"" message that prevents the copier from working... just for printing and fax working correctly, it's way too expensive.I see that many other users are having similar problems. It means that some obvious feautures did not go through QA. It makes sense since my HP laptop misbehaves in the same way. I think I'll stay away from HP products until I hear some better reviews."
4,hp almost scores a cigar.,"If it wasn't for it's noisy operation, especially before and after an operation, the hp officejet d135 is quite an impressive machine. I'm running this machine for document management using a software program from Scansoft called Paperport 8.0. Wow! the performance is superb! However, if you can afford to go the extra [$$$] or so, buy the hp officejet d145. For all of the extra functionality you get, the extra bucks are well worth it. Oh, and just to let you know, I have utilized every function, scan-fax-copy-print, and each produced consistent operation."
1,"HP User, but not anymore","I have the IDS error too. It seem there is no quick or easy fix unless you pay for so much that you can buy a new one.I am not sure it is just me or other people having the same experience, all my HP printers, 3 different models, started to show every kind of error or even broke down about a month or two after the nabufacturer warranty period expired."
1,How to waste a lot of time not getting what you want,"This device is a complete nightmare - I am driven to distraction trying to make it work. It worked for about 6 months and now I constantly get the scanner failure message. It now won't scan, copy or send faxes. Hewlett Packard service department just say reset it in a number of different ways and if that doesn't work take it to someone for repair, which I guess would cost more than it is worth. Should have been brilliant but .... it isn't."
1,Famous for failure,"This POS has been nothing but headaches. For some dumb reason we have kept it around as a backup but rarely use it (and when we need to, it doesn't work, often needing printheads replaced where it lives on for a very short while). It is one of the least reliable pieces of hardware I've ever owned. Do a Google search for 'D135 Scanner Failure'. Not worth it even if receiving unit free as a gift. Printer heads, ink costs are astronomical and unit will fail in very short order. Avoid like the plague."
3,product ok,"This is ok, but the problem is that the lip is very short. So if the bottom of your furniture has molding on it, the lip doesn't extend past that. I didn't use it on my furniture, since I was afraid it would rip off the molding and damage my piece."
2,"great idea, could have been so much better!","It's a wonderful idea, but it doesn't work well because of the way it's designed. To raise the jack you have to turn the screw on top and there is nothing for leverage to turn it. Hence the plastic yellow cap turns and not the metal piece to lift your furniture. It is not the size of any wrench and very difficult to turn. If it had an indentation like a screw head it would be far easier to use and make more sense. It also could have had a lever to push, much like an old fashioned car jack. I was disappointed and wasn't able to use it. But, at least I paid far less through Amazon than it was listed on ebay!"
2,Don't This Look Like The Dark...,"Seems like the Indie kids jumped on the bandwagon 1 album too late (or 2, if you count Trials & Errors.) Somehow Molina has lost that stark, focused, bleak energy that served him so well previously. Now what we're left with is a bland, boring, 80's bar-band solo act. Does anyone remember The Lioness? Those were good songs, delivered with all of the wrenching plaintiveness of a penetrating songwriter. Now we get a shallow, plunky, whiny, gloss version of what we used to love. I guess it's better than a lot of sh*t bands on their best days, but still a let down. And what's with everybody saying this is a ""hard-charging rock"" record? The only song with cajones is the opening track, the rest is a pallid imitation of a better time. And by now the Indie kids have moved on & the fans have either walked off or acquiesced to a lesser sound. Here's hoping Molina walks off alone into the woods & finds the real gloom again."
4,Great Collection.,"I really enjoyed this collection of stories, even with the shortfalls of one or two stories mentioned by the other reviewer. These are pretty dark stories that deal with people confronting deep personal struggle, or death.I would definately recommend this book"
4,Text books only go so far,"Text books can only bring you so far. Yet this book can get you the ""A"" you have been looking for. It has simple to understand knowledge with easy to interprete diagrams. A must have for any level-one high school Chemistry student. The only visible problem with this book is it lacks some detail, in the text, and visual maps."
1,I can't believe they printed this...,"unless they re-released this book! It is FULL of errors. I noticed this first when doing the problems in the back of chapter 4, the Charle's Law problems. Let's think about this for a second. If air (a combination of gasses) compressed to half its volume when the temperature went from 20 degrees C. to 10 degrees C., we'd be in a far different world than we live in now. But doesn't Charles' Law say V(1)/T(1)=V(2)/T(2)? So if you had 2 L at 20 degrees C, it should be 1 L at 10 degrees? NO!!!! In this equation, you must use degrees Kelvin. But 20 problems use C. Very very bad.Then, there is the equation for converting Fahrenheit to Centigrade. It has C = 5/9(F)-32. But, in fact, you have to subtract the 32 from the F degrees before you multiply by 5/9.Princeton Review should be ashamed of themselves!"
2,Mediocre Only,"As a high school Junior enrolled in the standard Chemistry class, I wasn't able to use this book to the fullest. It did not coincide with my class at all, and the material it covered was very slim, and lacking in detail. No matter how I tried, I was not able to relate the text to help me study for class. Maybe this book is for a higher-level high school Chemistry course, like accelerated or AP? Don't buy if you're looking for a study aid on your average, run-of-the-mill high school Chemistry class."
3,"patience, patience....","In between all the convoluted prose, the book can get interesting. However, he goes of on an ""artistic"" tangent way too much. To like this book, you have to have the patience to wade through it, and the foresight to know which pages to just skip."
5,Amazingly good,"Noir is fast-paced, well-written and honestly, one of the best buys in science fiction for years. Jeter has a dark sense of humor that can be disturbing for some, but that I personaly enjoy it very much. Noir is also full of references for those who can see them and is very inventive in many ways. Too bad some parts of it aren't fully developed (like the Land of the Dead). I hope we'll get another book set in the same 'universe' for it seems extremely rich and Jeter only gave us a glipse of it."
3,NOIR -- smooth but out of style.,"NOIR lives up to its retro reputation. I felt this novel as being totally outdated. It depicts a future that is super nihilistic (though not as nihilistic as DEATHLANDS: DARK EMBLEM). *yawn* So what else is old?Though an existence where you are trapped inside your own dead body is certainly a strong metaphor for homelessness, and has its right to be within any pages wherein a future dystopia is played out, I felt it was done with particular sensitivity to the characters involved. And I saw that the protagonist's own death as something noble, and that his willingness to live as a dead person with his dead wife as something that should be seen for what it is -- the ultimate sacrifice of a loving husband towards his wife. A really powerful message there!NOIR gives new meaning to the phrase I enjoy using often when reading a slam-bang thriller or action novel:""And they died happily ever after."""
3,"I'm sorry, I really am ...","I WANTED to love this book. I really did. I was excited when I bought it, and tore into it hoping for great things. But it doesn't live up. The ""black and white"" hook which seems to make it unique feels like a late edition add-on to make it more marketable and separate it from the William Gibson library from which it seems inspired.If the author was unknown, I'd swear this was William Gibson experimenting under a pseudonym, especially in light of his most recent horribly written X-files episode."
2,"Lots of promise, but not reward ...","I really tried to like this book. I think the concept of seeing the world through a filter of 'noir' is awesome. I also think the setting of this novel is very interesting in a Gibsonesque way. But. When I noticed the protagonist is called McNihil, and an office early in the book is called ""Foucault & Derrida"", I felt like throwing the book out of the window. IMO, this book has some very good ideas, but the execution is awful I gave up on reading it 20 pages from the end - too irritating. I expected more from a personal friend of PKD."
2,Interesting writing,"I didn't really enjoy _Noir_ all that much. The writing was convoluted, seemingly for its own sake at times, and it never built toward an ending. It seemed, rather, to meander in exacting description of just how bad everything is.The last 40 pages or so wrapped the plot together by revealing a lot of off screen action that made for a 'happy' ending. While the reader is struggling to understand the significace of McNihil's eyes, and why it is they are mentioned every 10 pages or so, McNihil is solving everything, without having the decency to let the reader know what the Hell it is that he's doing!It was, however, rather disappointing to wade through the baroque writing of the first few hundred pages and find it to be nothing more than scene setting. Not plot development. Scene setting.Sure, the characterizations are interesting, and yes, the world is somewhat dark. Wasn't worth the build up."
4,Nunns Applied Respiratory Physiology,"A very well written, and very useful text on respiratory physiology. Excellent work on mechanics of breathing, not quite so good on neural origins of respiratory activity. Useful sections on paediatrics, anaesthetics and sleep."
3,Useless out of the box,"Even a moderate wind tears it off the trampoline, so we had to attach velcro straps to keep it in place. During rain, water is collected inside it and causes the trampoline to dangerously sag, so we had to make a hole in the middle of the cover to let water out during storms."
1,Useless with 13'-14' enclosure,"Can't use this item with a 13 or 14 foot enclosure because the safety net, when properly connected, prevents this item from securing itself over the trampoline edge. Recommend that you raise the safety net at its bottom slightly or connect the cover to several spring areas around the trampoline with small rubber-coated s-hooks."
2,14 ft trampoline cover,"This trampoline cover fits the tramopline well. Some of the problems with it are that it is not pourous and the rain and snow collect in the middle and creates a large pond in the middle of the cover, it needs to be pourous or drains installed at stategic points around the parameter and the center. Also the elastic band around the outside does not hold it on the trampoline during moderate wind. If it wasn't for the pond or ice in the center it would frequently blow off and lodge in my neighbors yard.Airzone 14-Foot Trampoline Cover"
3,It's ok,Takes two people to put it on and a light wind can cause it to come off. Had to find a way to secure it to the legs to make it stay on.
2,Lack of coverage,"I can't recommend buying this cover. It's better than a tarp, but not much. I bought this product and some padding for the sides of our new 14' trampoline. This arrived first and it fit snugly. Within a few hours though a breeze blew it off because it doesn't come with any straps to secure it to the trampoline. Instead the only thing to hold it secure is some bungie like material sewn in the cover. Poorly designed, cheaply made. Once the padding arrived, I tried putting this cover on again and it didn't fit over the extra material (only about 1/2 padding). I have it secured with plastic joint clamps from the home improvement store. Fortunately for this situation we don't get much rain here in the desert. I don't think I can fit a large ball under there to keep the rain from pooling in the center. I will just remove it when it rains. I would recommend only buying a cover that has some straps to secure it against the wind."
4,Pardons for everyone!,"There is enough evidence here to say that they all the trials should be mistrials. It also says something about the politics in the country right after the Civil War and how little the parties may have changed since that time to now. Gowen was an early version of the ENRON CEO, a little before his time."
1,Horrible case and feeding/storage design,"The picture of this fish tape led me to believe that the tape rolls up inside the red reel.Actually, the red reel is split in the middle and the tape is pressed in between the two clamshell halves to reel it up. The pressure needed to get it in the slot is very high and hurts my hands on the thin fish tape.I am returning it and will exhange it for a roll-up version that will certainly be more expensive but much easier to use."
5,Economy fish,Great for speed work. Home depot stopped selling this because its cheap and it cut into sales of more exspensive reuable snakes. Good price. Set up multiple pulls ahead of time and cut after this is nonretractable.
1,onkyo reliability,I bought this player & watched about 20 movies. It started reading no disc. Brought to repair shop. Just out of warranty.Needed new laser only available from onkyo in florida. Part cost to the repair shop ... Who knows how much in labor. CANNOT recommend onkyo.
4,A Very Complete Belly Dance Instruction DVD,"This dvd is very thorough. Ayshe, the instructor, takes you through all the kinesiology of the movements so you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing. The dance workouts are fun and challenging. I believe this is good for anyone who'd like to jump into a class and know a little before starting, or for someone wanting to learn the dances in the privacy of their own home. It's also a great workout."
5,Really helpful!,"The tutorial explains exhaustively what the exercises are and how to do them. This has been very helpful to me. I also like the actual workout having two options -- with the instructions spoken or with only music to accompany the workout. It is one of those workouts that will be useful for a long, long time."
1,Not Good,This is not for beginners--not everyone can teach people how to dance and this is one of those instances. The instructor goes so fast... she does not give you time to really get the moves down before she goes into the next routine.I did break a sweat but it was because I was trying so hard to keep up and I still was confused and lost. There are other DVD's out there and I would strongly suggest getting one that is for beginners and where the instructor does enough reps to make sure that you are following it. Rania has some good ones that have helped me.If you have the belly dancing basics and want to give yourself a challenge then this may work for you. I am just learning and it was hard to keep up since I am still ackward on my feet and with swinging my hips.
3,Requires too much room,"Content-wise: This is fantastic. I'm not going into that. It just is.However, I have to give this a 3-star rating. The ding comes from the fact that too many of the moves require more space than I have ever had in any apartment I have ever lived in with the exception of the point in time I had no furniture. My ability to do the moves properly impacted my workout. She is a fantastic instructor, but she has a studio, and doesn't have to worry about space. Most people will be doing this in a living room on carpet in a small space.*sighs* Maybe someday I'll be able to afford my own studio and space and actually be able to make use of this video."
2,"really, really easy, not in a good way","if you're looking to lose weight look elsewhere. if you're looking for a challenge too. this dvd is EASY and you won't work out a sweat. and i'm not even in great shape, mind you. i work out 3 times a week for about 45 mnts and get tired fast. i could do this workout twice and still not be feeling it. for starters, from warm up to cool down it's just 30 mnts. there are not enough repetitions per set to work out any muscle. i have taken many belly dance lessons and i consider myself an intermediate level dancer so maybe i was looking for the next level and i didn't find it. there are better dvds out there. the twins come to mind, i forget their names."
1,I want my money back,"I have contacted this seller twice, and have not received my video.The replies are done by a computer, and i would like my money back!"
4,The workout is great,"The dvd didn't get 5 stars because the technique portion may make you want to shoot yourself. Way too drawn out- she talks each detail of every move to death. Overkill to the point where you may have had the move at the demonstration... but once you have listened to all of her instruction, you now are just totally confused cuz she gives you a little too much to think about.If you are a seasoned bellydancer- you will enjoy just going to straight to the workout. If you are a beginner- the technique tutorial is not very helpful, you may want to try this dvd after you have learned the moves from another source so you can avoid having to use the tutorial.But at least, you do not have to endure the entire tutorial for instruction on a single move because she has each move on a menu where you can select an individual move and just review directions on that one move alone. So it is not totally painful."
5,20 Years of Fun,Our 2 year old son enjoys Sesame Street very much. This 20 year collection is one of his favorites!!! We enjoy it as adults also. I found it to be a good value for the money.
2,Fun memories but disappointed.,There were only three discs with just 2 episodes on each disc. A bit disappointing when you are expecting several years of episodes!
5,Great book at last to uncover the true Gandhi,"At last someone actually has unmasked Gandhi (Gand...meaning garbage in Punjabi; hi meaning it is). I remember when I read Gandhi's, ""My Experiences with Truth"" in my early 20's I was puzzled to read his loyalty towards the oppressor in South Africa and not with the oppressed. Further reading of his own book made me wonder about the idealist who is portrayed as Father of the Indian Nation and his true being.A must read for any and all Western people who want to study India, Indian contemporary politics and race relations. I will make this book a gift to all my Western friends who are interested in India, non-violence, anti-Muslim riots in India so that they can read Gandhi's own words. Great effort and of course it had to be a Singh (lion) to write and confront the Indian Administration's propaganda machine!!"
3,Bare bones,"No extra features, just a menu and the game, not any different than what you would get on ESPN Classic."
4,this is the antidote...,"...to all that wack stuff. i pick up all Bigg Jus releases, the man works with staggering consistency. i find the beats on this album much more accessible than the nms albums. as always the rhymes are concious, intelligent and thought provoking. i wanted to temper the praise of the first review but have to say it really is that good. presumably you're checking this as a co. flow or just a Bigg Jus fan but either way you need to pick this up. as good as black mamba serums for me, real solid at thirteen tracks, it's dense like a white dwarf. beats and poetry with the caustic flow make this one of the albums of the year. lone cats. and kev brown are nice too. peace"
4,The Other Grieg,"I am so sick and tired of any compilations of Grieg's Orchestra featuring only his Piano Concerto and the Peer Gynt Suites. Finally, a compiliation for those of us who ALREADY HAVE the aforesaid pieces which are of course, very great and wonderfully written. But, the degree of Grieg's extraordinary orchestrating ability is best shown on this disc. My personal favorites are the orchestrated Lyric Suites on the first disc, the last of the Symphonic Dances, and the Two Elegies. Griegs use of stringed instruments is wonderful making the best of the many things that they can do. His melodies are memorable and so evocative of different moods that they will stay with you long after you've listened to them. I also recommend his Violin Sonatas. Kawabata Narimichi's Valse Triste CD has a nice recording of the first one. Experience Grieg's other great music. Expand your world!"
2,Adventure?,"Hardly and adventure guide to the Bahamas, this guide gave only brief mention to various outdoor sports and focused mainly on dining, shopping, and lodges. The information of dive spots is much more detailed in numerous other guide books. An average introduction to the Bahamas, but seriously lacking in detail. Please change the title."
5,An outdoors-oriented adventurer's guide,"This updated third edition of the Adventure Guide To The Bahamas And Turks & Caicos includes heavily expanded sections on hotels, restaurants, dive sites and fishing in all the Bahamas, surveying the best of adventures and establishments. Adventure Guide To The Bahamas And Turks & Caicos is an outdoors-oriented adventurer's guide, and destination-oriented visitors will appreciate the attention to regional specialties and attractions."
4,www.bahamas-rental.com writes:,"This book does not purport to be exhaustive, and, certainly, it is not. But for the price, it is an excellent introduction to a relatively unknown part of the world, The Bahamas. This group of islands seems to have some of the best fishing, diving, and boating in the world, and you can feel it in these pages, which is a switch from most other bigger, more expensive books. Loved the part about Eleuthera."
5,Indispensable,"The theory behind this important collection of essays is that ""the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms."" These essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well. Each essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and thirteenth century Europe. At issue in each are the questions of what or who held the power to command or punish, and how that power was obtained, kept and manifested. This is a truly enlightening book. Of particular interest are the essays on holding power over the truth, as well as those dealing the formation of the nobility into a self-consciously chivalric warrior class. However, all the essays are intelligent and useful explorations into the very nature and meaning of power. Ultimately, this book must be considered essential for any serious student of history, casual or academic."
5,power adapter,This adapter is just like the one that comes with your player. It gives so many attachments that I didn't even know exsisted. You can go anywhere with it.
4,Some how addicting...,"When I first played this game, I thought I'd hate it. Actually, I liked it. Graphics are decent for a 2D game, but let me tell you this. If you don't like side-scrolling games, annoying repeating phrases, having to read constant text and don't like fantasy games, don't get this game. The language is mild but they have some stuff reffering to other stuff, you know what I mean? Anyway, this game isn't for little kids because you really gotta use your head and think fast or else it might be too late! This is like an arcade-ish game. Rent it first or borrow it. You might like it."
4,jose garcia,I wonder if you're going to sell the official albun global and South African soccer barjitas panini panini and if if it will sell empesarian day
4,Rabbits like this too!,I do not have a ferret. I have two large mini-lop rabbits. They fight over this hammock. The only drawback is the fact that it isn't very durable. They have chewed around the edge of it. I will be buying another as a Christmas gift to them this year!
5,AWESOME,"I love this workbook! It is a must have for every AP Vergil student and teacher. The exercises are excellent for preparing students not only for the translation and essay portions of the exam but also for the notoriously difficult multiple choice passages. YEAH, finally a great exam preparation book!"
1,NO ANSWER KEY,"Guess what -- this book includes no answers at the back. So it is useful if you have a very experienced teacher of the Aeneid. Or you just want to become familiar with the types of questions on the AP exam. But if you are working your way through the Aeneid for the first time, and need some confirmation that you are on the right track, this is not a very useful workbook. The teacher's manual does not seem to be readily available."
2,It is not what i expected,"What didn't make me feel comfortable about this book is the Judy text about her own life, this is full of resentment and pain. I think there is space in literature for that type of history, but not in a book that is meant to be for people's enlightenment. I believe that in order to get nice things in life, you don't need to repeat/read painful histories over and over again. It doesn't help woman empowerment, when they feel themselves like the victims.I am a woman and I don't think the idea is wrong about having a partner in the esoteric practices. I just think that focusing too much in a relationship in order to look for your spiritual goals is a bit dangerous. Woman need to feel strong inside themselves first of all, then whatever comes on a loving relationship is a plus and consequence."
4,HP 920c Printer,"The only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars is the fact that the initial setup didn't go as smoothly as it should have.It is so quiet that you very literally have to stand next to it to tell if it's printing. The print speed is fast enough; it's not extremely slow. This is not the model to get, however, if you're looking for lightning speed. I use a parallel port connection, so that is probably why there's a slight delay in getting the print information to the printer.The print quality is OUTSTANDING! I only print photographs once-in-a-while, so I didn't buy the machine for that, but you can! Even on regular paper, the printed photographs don't even look computer generated.After set-up, I'd give this printer a 5 star rating. It's a definate value for the money. I doubt the more expensive models would do much better."
4,Good but heavy,Good pellets. Good consist groups and fit tight. I recommend them for pests at under 25 yards. They drop much faster than the lighter 7.9 grain Premier Domed and require more hold over. Not needed for pigeons and other small pests. All my air rifles shoot best with domed or round heads.
5,Most accurate,"These are the most accurate pellets I've tried - a great product. They hit game targets hard, too... best in my book."
1,Misleading,"I bought this enclusure for my Hedstrom trampoline. My last enclusure was not Hedstrom so I assumed that they were standard unless otherwise stated.After my husband unpacked all the pieces he saw hidden in the instructions - not in the beginning as it should have been, that if the trampoline does not have predrilled holes, call for free leg extenders. When I called, the customer service rep informed me that this enclosure only fits their trampolines. True or not, I don't know. This information is not in the add, nor is it on the box. Now I have to repack it, return it, and I am still in the market for an enclosure - very frustrating!"
3,Trampoline Enclosure,The enclosure is pretty good quality. Highly disappointed with getting parts. There was two missing pieces in the kit. A bolt and a cap. Been waiting for parts for the past six weeks and still havn't recieved them. Parts have been on order coming from China.
3,Not compatible with all trampolines...,"I purchased this because it was suppose to be compatible with all trampolines size 14', but it is not. My trampoline has four supports with eight legs total. The layout of the legs did not match the layout of the poles for this safety net, so it would not bolt up correctly. My advice, if you are going to purchase a trampoline and plan on getting a net later... don't!! Go ahead and spend the extra money to buy them both at the same time that way you know they will work together properly."
3,Jump Harder,The enclosure went up fairly easily. One drawback that the net has is that you have to tie yourself in once you get in. There's no velcro or magnet or simply an overlapping mesh doorway/portal to get onto the trampoline? Who wants to tie themselves in once they get onto the trampoline. We simply leave it open and there's a little area that's not fully netted. That's all.
3,Could be better,"This Safety enclosure needs a zipper besides tie straps. The other enclosures I've seen has a zipper and clips for reinforcement. The ties are frails and two of them shreded within the first week. It does the job... However, near the entrance is where a kid could get hurt. I always am paranoid and supervise their jumping."
1,Terrible book,"This book is full of conjecture and theories about what different audiences supposedly thought about blackface minstrelsy and Bert Williams in particular. Since there is not way to know for certain what each individual thought, it is entirely conjecture. That Bert Williams was very successful and apparently pleased his audiences speaks for itself."
3,Fairly good retrospective of Time Mag,"I've always been a fan of Time Magazine, and i think in general it is a good magazine. it was nice to see the history of the Time, but there was a lot they left out. i don't highly recommend this book, but then i don't chase anyone away from it either."
5,R'n'B ELP,"Like a down and dirty version of Emerson Lake & Palmer, Niacin mix elements of what made ELP great, with elements of other early Prog 'n Blues bands such as Family and Audience. The track ""Things Ain't What They Used To Be"" would have been a staple on 70's radio if it had been released 25-30 years ago. Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple) vocals and Steve Lukather's (Toto) guitars definitely add a nice touch to the sound. I'd love to see these guys do some more tracks in this same vein on the next album. (C'mon Magna Carta, get them all together for another record) Plus a nifty cover of Van Halen's ""Mean Streets"""
4,Niacin - Sophmore Release With Special Guests,"This is the sophomore effort from progressive rock all stars Niacin. Generally I like this album better than their debut. The songwriting is more evolved overall and the music is generally better. All three musicians are still at the top of their game and there is plenty of great keys, bass, and drums to satisfy anyone who enjoys this mix of prog, blues, jazz, fusion. The band even do a cover of Van Halen's Mean Streets with an interesting version. Also guesting on the almost 8 minute, Things Ain't What They Used To Be are guitarist Steve Lukather (Toto) and vocalist Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple, Trapeze, Black Sabbath). Hughes has a great voice for this type of material and I really love the song. This is another good Niacin release."
2,"Great bass, yes, but bland music","Many of the songs have interesting bass lines, but that won't sustain the songs for more than a minute or so. The organ noodling is pretty bland, with mostly similar draw-bar settings to my ear, little use of the hammond's percussive capabilities. One standout track is #5, which is a bit more progressive and has a killer bass solo."
2,Where's the melody?,"Rhythm section is superb/outstanding. However, the song composition seems to progress little past a sometimes, somewhat interesting intro. Don't get me wrong, this type of three piece concept could be incredible with a little more imagination/inspiration; however 'deep' seems to have no sense of the melodic invovled. Matter of fact, the keyboard playing seems at most times to be nothing more than uninspired, second rate ""jamming"" with very little forethought involved. They have done much better and can do it again."
3,The book was better,"If you have not read the book, you will probably rate the movie higher. It is a good, family-friendly story about a young boy during World War II and Mr. Tom, who takes him in. However, the book was excellent and much more detailed. The story line is the same, but if you want to share this wonderful story with your kids, read the book with them instead."
4,An unforgettable tale of learning to love!,"This was a touching (and moving) tale of an older man learning to love again (after the death of wife and child many years before). He is very set in his ways, when a young boy is foisted on him, to be taken in as a London child escaping from the Blitz. Through the boy the old man sees, once again, that life is meant to be lived and caring is something that has new meaning."
3,ENJOYABLE,"goodnight mister tom was an enjoyable novel and video. it provided an insight into issues which are not as familiar and talked about as they should be. Good Night Mister Tom is a novel which focusues on the stresses and pressures faced by children affected by war, poverty and child abuse.It deals with 9 year old William who is a victim of child abuse, and is taken in by a man in a country town of britain after his mother is unable to take care of him during the war. Mister tom provides the love and care william deserves by simply treating him as he should be ."
3,disappointing,"Sometimes you read a book and both dread and look forward to the movie. The book is one of my favorites. I read it to my class every year and it never fails to move me to tears. I was anxious to see the BBC adaptation but was truly disappointed. There is so much depth to this story and so many vitally important story lines - almost all of which was glossed over in this film. I show it to my class as a comparrison activity after reading the book. There are so many wonderful film adaptations of great books, but this is not one of them. You get the feeling that large sections of the story are missing - and you are right. It is a beautiful movie to watch and still tells a touching story, but read the book first."
1,what was edited out?,"I bought the British version of this, which clocks in at 101 minutes. The American version runs 84 minutes. What was cut in this version? And how, if you cut 17 minutes, does this classify as the ""unrated"" version? If someone has an answer, I'd be interested to hear it.Joe"
3,Masterpiece Theatre DVD have been heavily cut but movie is still wonderful,"'Goodnight Mr Tom', in my opinion is wonderful movie but... after watching Masterpiece Theatre DVD, I was bitterly disappointed because some parts of the movie have been cut out :(3/5"
5,Heartwarming,Beautiful story that possibly could and probably did happen to children...and to people who thought they had no love left in their heart.
5,heartwarming film of love and redemption,"We really enjoyed this movie about a bitter old man and an abused young boy who help each other heal their spirits through war, separation and death."
4,Goodnight Mr Tom,"This is a great story for older children. I used it with a class of 11 - 13 year olds where we read the book first and then did a movie study. The story follows a period of time during WW2 in England when evacuees were sent from London to the country. This story is complex because it covers many levels; War, child abuse, mental health, death, friendships and relationships.The movie is well acted, although my class was disappointed that some of the 'book bits' were missing.Be sure to have tissues for laugh out loud fun as well as sad tears!"
3,"The Classic ""Movie vs Novel"" Debate","This is a 'nice' movie, with a typically strong performance from John Thaw. However, if you have read the novel, you may find this small screen adaptation disappointing. To compact this touching story into 90 minutes the director has sacrificed any real character development, and in doing so has lost most of the emotional impact created in the novel. Still, it's okay for a rainy afternoon."
3,"Great story, poor acting","I am a HUGE fan of the book, Good Night Mr. Tom. However, the movie just does not live up to the book. The acting by both Will and Mr. Tom is poor, especially by Will. The story itself is so good that given good acting, this could have been a great movie. However, the poor acting really put a damper on things. In addition, the movie omitted huge parts of the book. Will's relationship with his friends are not really developed, for example. In fact, basically all the story points are underdeveloped in the movie compared to the book. As a result, the emotion just isn't there.However, none of these drawbacks can take away the fact that this is just a wonderful, heart-warming story. If you were a fan of the book, you'll probably enjoy it. I'd read the book first, though. The movie, as is so often the case, just isn't as good."
3,It was O.K,"My opinion of the movie Good Night Mr. Tom is that I don't like it. I don't like it because the movie changes alot of things and doesn't put them in the same order as the book did. For example, Mr.Tom's son's name was John Oalkey in the movie not William Oakley like in the book. Another example is when Willie was given his surprsie party. Mr.Tom went to get him from the church instead of Zach like in the book. Also, Mr.tom threw the belt away into his garden. And, in the book he just puts it away for safe keeping. These examples conclude that the movie is not like the book."
4,Solid,"This is a solid cable. It does what it is supposed to, feels sturdy, and helps me play music. 4/5 stars because I rarely decide anything is perfect. I just couldn't tell you what nonperfect trait this cable has."
4,good product,"I originally ordered this as well as a five foot cord. The ten foot cord burned out and came undone from the casing in a few days, however the five foot cord stayed together so I ordered another ten foot hoping it was a one time incident, which it was. Very happy with my cords, not so happy about having to spend another ten dollars on a new cord."
3,A Classic but dated,"I bought and read this book about ten years ago. I used it to start a weightlifting program. There is alot of good information in this book. However, the book is somewhat dated. As I learned from other serious, competitive body builders, there is too much training advised in this volume. Even people who juice don't train this much - and you don't have to to achieve great results. For example, Dorian Yates trains alot less than what Arnold advises in this book and he was Mr. Olympia for a number of years. Consequently, you better off purchasing a more recently published book."
1,Useless book waste of money,"This book does not live up to it's name ""encyclopedia""..only thing good about this book is the photos of various exercises.. everything else is horrible..there is no proper discussion of nutrition or any other aspects of bodybuilding...don't buy this book you will come to regret it"
4,Step-by-step teaching,It's really an Encyclopedia offering information about everything for newcomers. It's written in a simple style. It contains information about positioning
2,Outdated and not recommendable for begginers in weight train,"If you admire the Arnolds' phisyque and you have in mind to get huge and ripped as him then you'll surely buy this book. (As I did) But this book is outdated in various senses, nutrition is a very important subject in bodybuilding, and new research in this area like complements and other sources are not founded here. Neither the steroids /drugs subject is honestly approached. There are many holes hidden in this sport and they are not clarified in this book. This book strees, however, the importance of endeavor,courage,commitment and mental attitude and I think this is the most important contribution that you can take from this book and of course from the Arnold's teachings, but definitely these are not all the ingredients to become a PRO bodybuilder."
3,She's so hot,"I have loved Amy Jo Johnson since forever! She is why I watched Power Rangers as long as I did. I wouldn't of watched (and get hooked to) Felicity had it not been for her. When I saw she was releasing a CD I was chuffed! I was all hell yeah let's buy it! and i did. I was a lil' disapointed. It's more rock than I expected. And some of the songs are little weird. The best songs are number one...something about a Fareway i think...and number 10 when she says something about 'true love, idealistic daydream...' then more stuff. Those two songs are like 10 stars, but some of the oter songs drag it to a rating of 3. But buy the CD, nevertheless. Support this attractive artist! Heh."
3,It's fun,This CD is fun. It's not great but it's fun. I watched Amy Jo Johnson on the Power Rangers when I was a kid so I was already a huge fan. I knew that she was a pretty good folk singer so I bought the CD. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either. The songs are fun but they aren't classics. This is the kind of music you listen to when you just want to do something fun for a while. The songs aren't deep thought-provoking classics but they are okay. The last song (Goodbye) is really good and it makes the album.This CD is a quick hour of fun that's worth the price if you like Amy Jo Johnson or odd folk music.
5,GREAT MUSIC,Amy Jo Johnson put a lot of strength into her music and I believe that it can be felt when you hear this cd. Each song can apply to many moods of the listener. This is a great disc to add to one's music collection. The songs are great tunes and are worth listening to.
5,Outstanding debut effort!,"What a treat we have here...Amy Jo's first album is a definite must-have! THIS LADY CAN WRITE! The songs are solid melodically, they're well arranged, and her sweet voice complements her rock-flavored accompaniment VERY well! I was surprised at first listen because I had expected an all-acoustic folky sound like I had seen her deliver on the Felicity TV show. Was I ever pleased to hear her sound being more developed and carried one step further! Yet her songs are pleasantly NOT buried in overprodiction or overarrangement---a perfect blend of good song and good sound. Her lyrics are sensitive and often introspective, staying true to her folk roots. Hats off to this impressive debut---Amy Jo Johnson is truly a multi-talented performer. I can't wait for her NEXT disc!"
5,Liberal Catholic is NOT an Oxymoron!,"Editor Mary Jo Weaver has gathered a great group of prominent theologians, academicians and scholars to write about ""hot button"" issues facing liberal/progressive American Catholics. What she has produced is an outstanding collection of essays that give voice to that group. Each essay examines a different issue, such as birth control/abortion, the role of women in the church, the liturgy and many more. The essays are academic in nature yet accessible to all readers in its style and tone. If you're a liberal/progressive Catholic and want need some support for when people attack your views, this book is a must."
5,Noailles rising,Captivating study in English of Anna de Noailles' poetry. Perry allows us to discover this powerful woman who had such an impact in France at the turn of the century and up to her early death in 1933. An incredibly thorough study with numerous and qualitative translations of Noailles' verse and poetic prose. Anna de Noailles has been well served!
5,The BEST Birthing DVD Ever Made!,"If you are ever planning to birth a baby, or are working as a doula, midwife, or women's health instructor, I HIGHLY recommend getting this DVD. It is now available in a full-length feature film (wonderful!) and a shorter instructor's version for use in classrooms. It is BY FAR the best birthing DVD I have ever seen. If you have been disillusioned by ""Baby Story"" episodes on television, or horrified at terrible hospital-room birthing stories your mother, friends, or the media tell - get this! It will empower you with real, factual, and beautiful knowledge of birthing and your body's amazing natural power and abilities. There are 11 natural births featured within, as well as many other extras on topics such as lotus birth, diaper freedom, circumcision, etc. It is THEE BEST money I have ever spent on a DVD or Birthing Information."
5,Birth as it Should Be,"Elena Tonetti-Vladimirova, the creator of ""Birth Into Being"" has done a remarkable job of showing us how water births can be so rewarding to mother, father and child. Birth should not be an experience that women fear but an experience that excites us and we look forward to. ""Birth Into Being"" shows us how birth can be a positive experience for everyone.The women who offered their birthing experience to us through this DVD are to be admired as they are showing us a new way . . . a new way of birthing. I want to thank Elena for her great contribution to all women of the world. May her work reach the far corners of Earth."
1,A Dangerous Video,"I am a Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator and a Prenatal Yoga Instructor.This video is produced and created by some scary folks. There's been a video going around the internet of a woman swinging a baby by it's ankles, etc. The video is real - and dangerous. [...]On Elena's website [...] She openly says she's trained by this man, Igor.So, no matter how beautiful the natural births are in the video, we need to stop buying and viewing this video. It is irresponsible to support these people."
5,Magnificent!,"Birth As We Know It depicts birth as we should know it. When we witness birth as an ecstatic experience, as we do again and again in this film, women will no longer birth in fear but instead they will birth in the magnificence of the life-changing event. And, babies born to women who birth in ecstacy will be a whole new breed--without birth trauma as a defining moment and without the normative abuses most of us experienced as newborns. Elena's film gives hope for birthing women, birthing babies, and for the world in which we all live. This is a must-see for everyone!"
5,"Beautiful, informative, a must have!","I saw an ad for this video in Mothering magazine. I went online and bought it immediately. It has really opened my eyes to a whole new world of childbirth choices. It's because of this video that I'm looking into a home waterbirth for our next child. It shows real births that are not painful and stressful, which is the way birth should be. I think every mother and mother-to-be should have this in her video library, and should share it with all her friends and family."
2,Is this Alan Parson?,"Alan Parsons Project was unique, talented, original. There were feelings, emotions, melodies that were giving me a goosebumps. What is this now? Bunch of digital notes through the computer?I have a software that creates music, you pick the instruments and... in 2 minutes the song is composed and recorded. I can even do in AC3 Dolby 5.1, its easy. Sounds the same to me and to all my friends. We have compared side by side.I guess you know all what I am trying to say. This music is OK for people who love computer noises. And for people like me, lets wait and see what is Alan will come up next with... : -)"
2,Ugh...I agree with Tievoli,"Alan Parsons is SO much better than this! What happened to the perfectionist I met in 2002? I have all of his albums and this is easily something that should have been offered as free add'l material with a ""real"" release. I miss the soulful vocals of Gary Brooker and others. It isn't acceptable until the third track and even then it falls painfully short for such a talented man. Thanks for signing my 'Dark Side' album though :)"
3,Blind Passion-She Should Have Known Better,"A very good, well-written crime novel that kept me interested all the way through. However, you can't feel real sorry for the women who threw a good life away, a good husband and her own child for a real loser who ended up murdering her. He had nothing to offer, you come away thinking she was a real shallow person and thought only of herself, so it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for her, but, still, overall, a good read for people who like True Crime stories."
3,Searching for Self,"Blind Passion takes us into the dark side of our being as we delve into the reality of real life events and sad truth. Julie helps us realize the 'incomplete side' of the psychie wherein many live their entire life trying to become 'whole' by responding to the 'holes' in life. John Glatt is a fast paced writer, while demonstrating the ability to give us all we need to know as we move along the text.As we read the events of Julie's life we are aware that those who knew and loved her saw pattern of life she set before herself. Through their love of and for her they saw warning signs of danger that were invisible to her.Become self takes a whole lifetime. Sadly Julie's ended too soon."
2,must love death metal,the music on this is good and not veried from the originals buy much but the vox kill this collection entirlly
1,Tribute Or Violation?,"I am getting tired of tributes. Nativity In Black I was o.k., but now I think every metal band on the planet tries to make some tribute to their own wallet. If they want to make a tribute to Black Sabbath then they should have a cover version on their own CD. But this is just making money with the name Black Sabbath."
3,Tribute to Sabbath review,Have only heard short samples of about half the songs.I liked the music over all but some of the lyrics are pretty growly.
2,Not So Bad,"I almost didn't buy this cd, because of a review, but I'm glad that I did. The songs that I got it for plays fine. And as for the scratches, you hear some but the songs play all the way through, uninterupted. So I'm happy with it."
2,Wrong Title,"Short and sweet: you cannot use this book alone to begin a ""Mage: the Awakening"" campaign. The ""World of Darkness"" handbook is required to generate a player character and get the majority if the game systems' rules of conduct and confluct. It should have been marketed as a suppliment instead of a starting book."
3,This ain't your daddy's Mage,"The core ""idea"" behind the book is good and worth it to me to have bought it. They fixed a lot of my issues with the previous incarnation without creating a ton of new ones to replace them. Some concepts are easily able to be ignored or pushed even further into the background (such as the Atlantis mythology). Unfortunately, the layout and color scheme make the book hard to read. Additionaly, this game is a farcry from the Mage: The Ascension and if you are looking for an updated version of the game I suggest not buying this book. Also it is far less powerful then the old game as it is possible to get to the rank 5 power levels. If you are looking for a game of modern occult (with a pinch of horror) and you don't mind reading a rule book 3-4 times to get it all straight I think this may be for you."
2,Showed up damaged,"The book had all the pages, which was good, but there is a crack along the back cover next to the spine that goes from the bottom to about 3/4 of the way to the top."
4,Solid system with a lousy setting,"I am not at all thrilled with the setting, but the system is great - flexible and fun. I bought it b/c I am writing some scenarios. Very much worth it."
2,Background Travesty,"The game rules are not terrible. They are fairly streamlined and idiot-proof. However, WW apparently could only simplify the rules by simplifying the background material. They took a wonderfully open-ended and absolutely brilliant background world (the consensual reality) and stripped it down to a cartoonish and rather silly Atlantis myth. Terrible. Just Terrible.I also find it amusing that they cleared out all of the metaplot history in Vampire to make the game more open to interpretation and less confined by metalplot events, and then went and eviscerated the background of MAGE, the WOD game that was MOST open to interpretation. A pale and dumbed down version of MAGE for the WOW generation..."
4,Audiofile Magazine,AudioFileThis magazine subscription came much faster than I expected. I received my first magazine within about two weeks. For any one who listens to audio books this magazine gives curreent reviews and has lots of advertisements. This will be a very helpful magazine in guiding me to future purchases of audio books.
1,where is it??,I never received this magazine so how would I be able to rate it?? I cant even find a way to let them know I never received it.
1,Can't Judge...Never got it!,"I ordered on 10/4/2005. As of March 27th, I still haven't received the first issue, I don't even want it now! How do I get credit for the payment made back in October?"
4,A theater masterpiece.,"Even if this play by Eugene O'Neill is trifle too long for my liking, it remains a great piece of theater, not only American but one of the world.Katherine Hepburn makes her role of the wife of a travelling shakespearian actor who was forced into drug addiction, alive.Her unconcerned, miser husband, who denies medical help for his younger son, rather heavy on the drink, is brilliantly acted by Sir Ralph Richardson. The film would lose a lot, had it been shot in colour. This rendition of the play gives it a rather historic value and makes a valuable addition to anyone's library.Joe Neustatl."
1,"FIVE stars for the performances, ONE star for DVD quality","I agree with the reviews, the performances are absolutely stunning, especially Katharine Hepburn's, possibly the best of her career if not one of the best ever captured on film.HOWEVER, this DVD release is atrocious. This is close to a three-hour film and they crammed on to one disc. That wouldn't be so bad had they done a new transfer, but this looks like the same one used for the VHS tape. Cropped for the TV screen like the video release, (this was definitely shot in widescreen, according to imdb.com), it's got the same gritty, low-res quality. You could tape this movie off of TCM or Bravo and get better quality. Rent it, tape it, but hold off on buying this until it's given a proper DVD release (if anyone from the Criterion Collection's listening, please license this movie!)"
2,Mediocre DVD transfer,"This is a powerful film that's making its long-awaited DVD debut and what do we get -- a scratchy print scaled down from widescreen to a 4X3 aspect ratio, essentially the same as its VHS presentation. The price is cheap for good reason ...this is a beauty that's been somewhat stripped of its grandeur."
2,Not for all tastes.,"First, the performances by Hepburn, Robards, and Stockwell are top notch. Noone else could have performed any of the roles better. But this film is basically a three hour argument. Everyone fights with everybody else. There are other movies with less than happy endings which I love, but seeing this one once was more than enough."
2,Long Movie's relapse into boredom,"The play wasn't so bad, but the movie was worse. Giving it a 2 was generous and the producer should thank his wonderful cast. Great acting was the only thing that kept me awake. Katherine puts on a wonderful preformance as a nervous maniac, I mean she had to spice that boring play up somehow! Actually, I have to give O'Niel some credit because it was an autobiography. As terrible a life he had, one day in his shoes bored me out of my mind. Sorry Mr. Taylor!"
1,Long Day's Journey Into Night,I give this movie 1 star but truthly I can't rate this movie because it had no affect on me nor did it bring out the full potential of the play. The actors could have done better job and the play doesn't seem to be brought alive it more died right away as it started. There was some very poor acting and the crying as well as Mary being a morphine adact didn't seem real enough. I have seen morphine adacts and how she played her role seemed more like a lunatic or a nut out of a nut house then someone addicted to morphine. The book was done wrong by this movie.
1,An entirely too long movie,"I'll be brief. This was three hours of pain and suffering. If it had been a short, twenty to maybe an hour long, it could have been more enjoyable. But three hours of mediocre acting with fake emotions was a terrible waste of time to me. Fans of the playwrite or actors, don't be outraged, this just wasn't a good production."
5,One of the best tragedies ever put on film,"As other reviewers have stated, there's very little to fault w/ this film. The faults that are there are technical and hardly worth mentioning in a work so perfect in every other way. This was one of the first films to receive awards for all of its performers at Cannes, and at first viewing, you'll see why. Katherine Hepburn would go on to win an oscar for work that is (to put it gently) far inferior to this. Here, she is peerless, and after watching her performance you'll have a hard time envisioning any other actress as Mary Tyrone (though Jessica Lange is definately mature enough to tackle it). Lumet has directed many a great film, and this is definately one of his best. The print here is about as good as you're likely to get ever, and it's definately worth any price. For anyone interested in what is surely one of the best films ever made in America, check this out...it's a keeper!"
3,"Great film, lousy DVD","I really can't believe that Criterion has released The Fugitive Kind recently, which is 5th-rate Tennessee Williams, in a spectacular transfer, and meanwhile nobody has bothered to restore or re-issue this great 1962 film, possibly one of the best play-into-film adaptations of all time. Really? Film companies are lavishing money and resources on releasing crap like Love Story and Where Love has Gone and Dead Poets Society on Blu-ray, but nothing for this masterpiece?Anyway, the 2004 Lionsgate/Republic DVD is garbage. It's dual-layered, but the print used is cropped, interlaced, full of artifacts, has no shadow detail and virtually no blackscale. It's atrocious and should have been taken out of print long ago."
3,Dense but Informative,"Harvey does a good job covering all of the history and basics, but the terminology and references are too dense for a casual read."
5,All hail the Wondering Boy Poet,"A welcome addition to the under-translated oeuvre of an incomparable writer. Species of Spaces is a collection of essays, fictions, and verbal bagatelles showcasing a Parisian who ""never wanted to write the same thing twice."" Perec fuses quotidian concerns with psychological imperatives, and takes you to places you've never been before. Perec's work is the infra and ultra of literature's spectral continuum. And he's gut-busting funny, too."
4,Sports Basketball Fiction,"After I read this I wondered if this was fiction or nonfiction. Back in the late '40s Kentucky had problems with fixing games, and lately I've read about some things at NOtre Dame and Northwestern. Schneider's book hits home with a problem that could really happen unless the NCAA starts paying its players some kind of stipend. This was really well done, and I encourage anyone interested in a good read, whether you like basketball or not, to pick it up. I don't think you'll be disappointed because there are some many great characters, including the priest and the trainer."
4,I liked it!,"Deep and emotional, The Fix is a potboiler from the opening scenes to the end. Much truth here, I'm sure, because I could see this actually happening in real life, especially after reading the other day where CBS has a $6 billion deal with the NCAA for tournament rights. I have three boys who all play sports, and they'll all be asked to read it when my husband is finished. Great story for everyone to share. I bet it becomes a movie someday."
3,Basketball purists will love it,"I liked the book, but I think if I liked college athletics I may have understood it a little better. Well written, though, especially some of the parts about the father, Fletcher. That's what drew me to the book--the writing. He's really, really good at painting pictures. I'd recommend it, but I'm just saying a three star, could be a four, I guess..."
3,"Neat idea, but could it really happen?","I dunno, I liked the story, but fixing the Final Four seems kind of hard to do. But I guess it could happen. This is a good college basketball book, I'll let my boy read it, but I'll have to cross out some of the language. That's not a problem for me, cause I know it really happens in real life, but kids might not need to see it."
3,"Good story, somewhat out there...","This is good, but I don't think anyone could fix the Final Four. There's plenty of suspense, and the twists and writing are above average, but I just couldn't help my disbelief. My brother loved the story, so did my father, but I can't see how the NCAA could really let something like this happen. The writer really never said what year this happened. Basketball players ought to read, maybe not women, though. Lots of language."
4,The FIX is The Bomb!,"You want a great summer read, get this book today! I don't care if you don't like basketball and the mob and the NCAA, still get it. I thought I was watching Rocky when I read about Mike Kramer's life and struggles. Excellent, down to earth writing that doesn't talk over anyone's head. My girlfriend even liked it, and she doesn't like anything, including me."
5,TOM CRUISE WILL PLAY MIKE KRAMER,"If Tom Cruise doesn't become the lead character in this movie to be then I'll eat your hat. The Fix has one of the greatest main characters I've ever read in Mike Kramer. I cried at the end of the book when his father came to the rescue, and Mike forgave him for all his past abuse and neglect. This is one of the five best books I think I've ever read, and if you don't believe me, then go read it yourself. This will be in Hollywood in the next couple years. If not, then I'm a total idiot. Story unleashed some very powerful writing that moved me to call my father and tell him that I love him. Great story...great movie to be."
4,Spiritually uplifting,"Schneider weaved a great story here, and he did it with some of the best, most original writing I've read for a while. Fascinating tale, one in which could actually happen, so someone tell the NCAA about it. One of these days they'll have a fix like this one on their hands. Excellent read for all ages, including women, even though it's about the fixing of the NCAA Final Four."
3,It was pretty decent. .,"I liked the little boy (George) in the movie, he was like an old man. . he knew what he was talking about too. I was a bit sad when Ignacio Serricchio (Ed) died, he was sexy. . .atleast he didn't become a zombie. .I thought it was a pretty decent movie. . I think I like this one better than the first though. . .all that camera and ""night vision"" footage in the first one was a bit annoying for me!"
5,Quarantine 2: Terminal,This is a science fiction story continued from Quarantine 1 about an invisible disease from outer space that is out to destroy everyone on earth. Not something for the kiddies!
2,Quarantine: Book of Shadows,"So much like the sequel to Blair Witch Project, this movie pretty much fails. The first movie was an awesome first person pov movie that fit perfectly into the ""found footage genre,"" but much like Blair Witch 2, this movie is a disappointment.We find out why the virus was originally made and we find out that who we thought was the CDC, really is a branch of the army fighting bio-terrorism. I am pretty curious how a passenger managed to get a handgun onto a plane, even though he checked it.Also at the end when all the zombies seemed to come out of the woodwork when the black girl sacrificed herself to give her friend time to get away was a little confusing. At that point if my math was right, we should have had 2 infected left alive, but somehow 5 zombies run out and attack her.If you like survival horror, check it out, but if you're expecting an awesome sequel to the first movie, don't waste your time."
3,About as good as expected,"I didn't expect much and got exactly what I expected. It can hardly be viewed as a sequel to the original Quarantine, which was superior in every way.In short, the movie was worth watching, glad I rented it so I wouldn't have to sell it for a few pennies on the dollar to some trade outfit......sure wouldnt consider it a keeper if I owned the physical copy."
2,Quaran-teenager film that sucks for horror fans,Ugh - this is a disneyfied domesticated version of the brilliant Rec 2 - steer clear of this mess and make sure to see Rec 2.It actually started off promising but just ended up falling flat before the half way point. Its clearly aimed at the teen market with a bieber look alike and a cast that simply could not sell their souls and bodies enough to the hollywood whorporate machine to star in anything else better.Stick with the originals Rec and Rec 2 for real horror.
2,How did they make a worse movie?,"The creators of Quarantine stole another film idea. This time they ripped off ""Flight of the Living Dead"" (which is a much better movie BTW) and slapped a ""Quarantine 2"" sticker on it. The first Quarantine movie was a rip off of the Spanish film ""Rec"". This rip off was the worst movie I've had the misfortune of seeing. the plot was weak, the acting was terrible and the special fx needed help. What happened to original film making? What happened to great story telling and film making?....It's still happening...only in Spain as far as the Quarantine movies are concerned."
4,Surprisingly good,"The first Quarantine, which was a so-so remake of the spectacular Spanish thriller [REC], spawns a direct to DVD sequel with Quarantine 2: Terminal, and the biggest surprise here is that this sequel is surprisingly good, and better than the film that came before it. During the events of the first film, a plane taking off from Los Angeles ends up becoming the breeding ground for the same kind of rage/zombie virus for the crew and passengers alike, forcing them to land at a terminal and, you guessed it, get quarantined and race against the growing odds to survive. What really makes Quarantine 2 so good is that it's surprisingly well-filmed, well-acted, and even more surprisingly taut and suspenseful as well. Though it has its share of shortcomings, Quarantine 2 makes the most of its minimal budget and delivers the goods, which is something that many, many horror films of this type should take a big cue from. Check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
3,All Over the Place,"These reviews are all over the place, from glowing praise to outright hostility. First let me say that this is an okay direct to dvd movie. The acting is good, but not great. Some of the dialog is a bit stilted, but it is a horror movie and not a high drama. It is a parallel story with a slight continuation of the first Quarantine movie with a bit more of an explanation of what is happening and why. This is not a rip off of Flight of the Living Dead as someone pointed out. Also the first Quarantine was not a rip off of Rec, it was the English version of a Spanish language movie. They didn't steal the idea, they purchased the right to make an English version. Personally I like Rec, and I though Rec 2 was a better continuation of this saga, but not everyone likes to read subtitles. This is a fair pseudo zombie flick to hold you over until the new season of Walking Dead."
2,String doesn't hang nicely in your ear.,"I bought these awhile ago and finally went to wear them the other day and discovered that although they look great, the chain/string is some weird link that doesn't hang nicely in your ear. Box chain would have worked much better. Pity because they would have been great otherwise."
3,cute but don't stay in,"These are really cute and different, but I never wear them. Since the pearls weigh down one end, they end up sliding out of your ear after just a little while. I have tried putting a back on them (the small round silicone/plastic kind) but the stem is just too thick - they will hardly go on - to the point that it is tough to get them on the end, let alone over the entire stem and then to the chain where I could pull them up behind my earlobe, and who wants to see a plastic earing back hanging there? I recommend the plain silver version of these without added items."
4,Good Knitting Book,"I'm not a big Zoe Mellor fan, but I do think that she's got some very creative ideas. In this book, the items range from sweaters to bags, toys, and pillows. Everything is bright and colourful - exactly what kids up to the age of six like. Many items can be made for either sex - without even changing the suggested colourway. Many of the items are in themes kids like - specifically farm and wild animals. Because intarsia is used, the main stitch is stockinette, but other stitches (moss, garter, and cables) are used in the book. My only two complaints are that I wish the charts were clearer (but I'm not a big chart fan) and that the direction ""decrease at neck"" was explained. This book is worth picking up and looking at - and you may be surprised by what you see."
3,nice work,"This book is surely full of fun and nice projects. But every project is specified for different age group; so if you want a pair of cute slipper for your 6 years old daughtor, you may find that you need a lot more work than you think a pattern would do for you, because it only tells you how many stiches and materials are there for infants 3 or 6 or 9 monthes. Great book for looking for inspiration though, and study maybe, coffee table book even."
5,Another Great Book!!!,"I love all of Zoe Mellor's book. In this one the Ladybird pillow and blanket top my favorites list. The cover sweater comes in a close second. This author just seems to have endless creative ideas when it comes to knitting for children. Almost all of her patterns are unisex which is lovely.Happy Knitting,Nanette of Fruitland, ID"
3,Not able to use,"While the owner's manual said to change the drain plug gasket, it did not fall out or off when I unscrewed the plug. I was not about to pry the gasket off in fear it may cause some problems. I'll keep it until I find more info. By the way, even though I did not use the gasket, it does not leak oil."
1,Eco-Fun,"We have a science based six year old. School lessons and assignments have been fine. However, the projects found inside the covers have taken his interest and enthusiasm to whole new level."
1,One of the worst books ever....,This is one of the worst books on IT and business. It's seems to take the worst of business and IT and thrown it all together. Also the Wiley site has premade powerpoint presentations and quizes\tests to accompany this book...so intructors or professors (at least the one I have at the Univ of Maryland) do nothing but use these pitiful slides without edit and the test questions that are probably the worst I have ever seen....save your money and dont buy this book...and if your thinking about taking a grad school course that uses this book...think twice...
2,a well intentioned book that falls far short of the mark,"Considering that this book is in its second edition, it's interesting to note the number of bloopers in it. For instance, on page 519, there are 2 mistakes: one is a typo (no spell checker used); the other is grammatical (no editor used!). A serious omission is the impact of technology on leadership in organisations (at least this is a serious omission for a book so titled). The publishers (Wiley) probably have something to answer for as well, whereby the advertising doesn't match the product. This isn't the first time this has happened with them either. Normally it isn't a problem, but when you purchase through Amazon and you're in Australia, it's too much of an effort to squawk about the book not matching the expectations. I'm now going to contribute some comments about another Wiley publication (""Business Statistics: A Self teaching Guide""), where I'll continue my theme of books not living up to the hype."
2,Poor performer...,"Turban has created a book that does not fit the title. Rather than concentrating on IT management, he created an introductory book for managers new to IT. I was expecting to learn the all important steps of IT planning, lengthy discussions of ERP and networks, and the differences between mainframes and minis. Rather, we get brief overviews of these systems. Only one chapter is dedicated to ALL the types of planning. A completed plan isn't even included in the text!If you are teaching an intro to IT for managers, this book is fine. For IT Managers though, look for something else."
1,one of eight books on IS to stay away from,The book contains numerous factual errors and omissions of crucial material. Textbooks like these that are so full of misinformation are responsible for why management fails to get along with engineers.[...]
1,This is a cool book ...,"TO BURN! I hate it and so does everyone else who has read it. The authors are smart but they wrote the book for bung-junkies who smoke doobies and don't care about information technology. To answer a question in chapter 2, you have to read chapter 10 first. That's great if you have 3-cheek buttloads of free time and you're high off of laundry detergent and paint thinner, but not for me. Why are the questions so stinking hard?!? I think this book is used to brainwash us and make us more compliable. (...)Please do not read this book and contribute the world-wide molestation of our minds!"
2,Pretty good for a cool game,"This game is good for its type. I like the chase scenes, especially since you can choose different preferences for vehicles, weapons, etc. I was very excited about this game when I first got it. The enemies are in motorcycles and cars. You get to choose three different cars and people for your chase group. You can shoot at them, hit them with your car, and run them off the road."
1,if there was a reason to live this cd is not it.,This cd was so bad I almost threw it in the trash. I cannot even find one good thing about it other than the fact that decent bands tried to cover a band that already has very limited talent musically and still failed bad enough to suck the life out of metal. Warning! this cd is a mistake!
2,calorie counter,"I'm not impressed with this device, especially for the price. It is made of cheap plastic. The instructions are fairly clear and it was easy to set it up to get started, but I question the accuracy if you are not doing anything strenuous. It does not seem to record calories until you reach a certain exertion level. I wanted to know how many calories I burn when I am just ""living."""
4,caltrac,"I am happy with the product, very easy to use. The item took forever to arrive- close to 3 weeks."
1,Stopped Working After Week and a Half,"The product worked fine, and I was very happy with it. I was able to see how total calories I burned (activity and resting), was able to enter the calories that I eat/drank, and was able to see the difference between the two to see if I needed to eat more or less to keep in the fat burning stage. However, after a week and a half, I laid it down as I slept. When I woke up in the morning, it had stopped working. It smelled like it was burning on the inside, like circuitry problem. I tried to contact the Caltrac customer service, and I keep getting the fax machine. BEWARE!"
1,Not so good,"First of all, I paid more for this at a Target store :( Secondly, i went with interplak because of their reputation. I'm sorely disappointed. There is no power to this brush at all. I've had it about a week and have already decided to either purchase an Oral-B or to go back to manual brushing. I won't be trying another Interplak...."
5,My dentist is happy,"love this one. Tried other cordless ones, but like the small head on this one. You can really reach all areas of the mouth. Just make sure you put it in your mouth before you turn it on or the toothpaste will go flying due to the speed of the brush. my dentist is pleased."
3,INTERPLAK OptiClean,"Product seems to be just ok. It is certainly nothing to compare to the original Interplak that I have used for many, many years. It will be a year, or next dentist visit, before I know how well it works."
5,Priceless Flim,"Bachelor Mother is a priceless film; I've watched it for years now and I still laugh through it. Ginger Rogers and David Niven are wonderful and you feel the chemistry between them. But the best part of it is when Charles Coburn is lecturing Niven on his responsibility at the breakfast table and the throwing of the spoons and the butlers response to him. Priceless, funny, great timing! This is a great movie to watch and see in any season."
5,Delightful,"I had never heard of this movie and just watched the local library copy. What a gem! Very funny dialogue, excellent pacing, witty. Will put this one on my wish list. Christmas theme, too, for seasonal fun. Highly recommended."
4,Ginger and David are wonderful together.,This is the sweetest movie based upon a highly unlikely plot device. Ginger finds a baby on a door-step and David Niven refuses to believe the baby is not hers. Ginger and David are wonderful together. This movie proves that Rogers is a great actress. She leads you into the story with seemless acting. A very funny comedy.
3,Better than the first...faster moving,"I like the first one, don't get me wrong, it was just kinda slow moving. I love the visuals in the second, since it takes place in Hell. I like that we learn about Pinhead's origins and that Kirsty reminds him of who he is. I thought that scene was intense, especially the first time I saw the movie. Don't listen to people who say it was horrible, or who say it was fantastic. Its worth a rent for sure."
4,ehmm..guess who's back!!,"hellraiser:hellbound..well so here's number 2 in the hellraiser story..well i still think after seeing all the hellraiser films 112 times(at least) that the first is the best..but hell!..this one is great too..i'm not much for number 2's or 3's or even number 6's....but i think it's great nevertheless...now..in 1987 when the first hellraiser was shown i was to young to go see it..(i hate my mother for that..hehe)well..i guess 3 is too young..*lol*back to hellbound:i like it..i like the acting,the monsters,the make up is cool(as always) and i like Pinhead who still gives me the creeps..he's well played be doug bradley...i respect that...well..see it if you havn't allready..it's worth a look or 2"
4,NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART!,"AND I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DISTURBING THAN THE ORIGINAL HELLRAISER. I WAS WRONG. THIS MOVIE TRULY SURPASSES THE ORIGINAL, ADDING MORE DIMENSION, SCARES, GORE, AND STORY. UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL HELLRAISER, WHERE PINHEAD AND HIS GANG COME UP TO OUR WORLD, THE CHARACTER KRISTY, JOURNEY'S INTO HELL TO SOLVE AN EVIL PUZZLE TO STOP THE CARNAGE THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED. ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE BY BRADLEY AS PINHEAD. THIS STORY IS TRULY GOOD AND WILL MAKE YOU TURN YOUR HEAD QUITE A FEW TIMES IF YOU WATCH IT IN THE DARK. I SUGGEST YOU WATCH IT WITH A FRIEND. NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART! RATED R FOR: EXTREME VIOLENCE AND GORE, LANGUAGE, AND A BRIEF SEX SCENE."
5,HELL IS BOUNDLESS !,"HELLRAISER SERIES are a must.Each part is what a true horror movie fan deserves to see,and no one but Clive Barker has ever dreamed of.Pinhead,Dr. Channard,Chatterer,Female Cenobite,Butterball,Christie,Frank,Julia and the wacky patients are out of this world.Hellbound is wonderful.You interpret some parts the way you want.As to special effects,Dr. Channard's penis-like head/umbilical cord and snake-like fingers are one of the best things in the movie.HELL IS REALLY BOUNDLESS!"
4,Completely full of gore.,This movie is not for kids or people with weak stomaches! It is kind of confusing but it is full of horror and suspence. This is the movie where pinhead and the other cenobites return from hell. this movie is the bomb!!!
2,COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER,"YES this is a very popular movie and has some great ideas that are expanded on where the first movie didnt. But overall this is a plotless mess, thanks to some production delays that forced The first movies starAndrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) out of the picture. With no Larry Cottonto actually rescue the characters just wonder aimlessly through the maze of hell. And what a boring and unfrightening interpretation of hellthis is. Where are all the tortured souls and ripped flesh we were promised in the original. Hell is just some dark tunnels and some old mattresses. Big deal. Add to that the fact this movie hasnt aged well.Id like to like this, and parts I do like but too much went wrong during theproduction and the result is sort of well.. unfinished."
2,Gore Galore with a Hopeless Plot,"This takes place a few hours after the first installment in the series when Kirsty Cottin gets put in a mental hospital after witnessing her family getting brutally murdered. When a crazed psychiatrist hears Kirsty's story, he opens the gates to hell and the whole thing starts all over again. This sequel to the very popular 'Clive Barker's Hellraiser' proves to be a very poor effort. The movie mainly consists of lots of gore, and no imagination."
1,lame complety unessasacry sequel,"confusing, dragging,and overdone sequel. though provides ample gore and minor shocks,its a poor follow up to the oringnal. too confusing to hold any interest."
4,Surprisingly better than the first,"Normally, sequels aren't quite as good as the original. But Hellbound is an exception. More characterization is developed in this film than in Hellraiser, and Hellbound was certainly more suspenseful. Doug Bradley gives a good performance as Pinhead, the lead Cenobite. The only problem was that it took over half an hour for the real terror to begin. And for a movie just over 90 minutes long, that can hurt the film."
4,A Worthy Horror Sequel,"After the sucess of the oringial Hellraiser , Clive Barker who had made a name for himself passed on the diretcing duties to Tony Randel with the sequel. Randelmade an impressive sequel in Hellbound: Hellraiser II . The film has more gore and a new heroine to help out Kristy Cotton. Once again Juila is back but this time she's totally hell bent and the film's primary villian. Pinhead is still scary but gets some compettion from Doc who is scary in his own right. I give the film *** out of ****."
4,The Story Continues!,"Pinhead is back for more! I have not seen this movie in years, but I have been a big fan of the first 2 Hellraiser movies for years. It's cool to relive the story in DVD format and see the twisted mind of Clive Barker at work. I have no idea what he was thinking when he wrote these stories, but they are classic. Get this movie!"
4,HELL RAISER,The dvd arrived quickly. Both the case and the dvd's were in great condition. Glad to find this dvd set it's hard to find the first two together.
4,He Did It Again!,Mr. Barker really knows how to make good horror movies. hellbound is no where near the level of Hellraiser but it is still a good move. There are two versions of the movie the R rated and the unrated. Make sure you get the unrated becasue the R cuts out alot from the movie. The unrated adds more violence to the movie. The plot is a little weak and the new cenobite is really annoying. This is a great sequel to a classic.
5,"Suprisingly, this movie kicks ass!!!","I've never ever liked horror films...but when I saw this movie, that changed completely!! Not only am I a big fan of Clive Barker(flippin' genius if you ask me), but the fact of using the concept of S & M and maybe even acupunture, was really brought out! Some people say this movie was way too gory and sick, but thats the way it was sapposed to be. Do you really think that there would be a film being made like this that would have pink bunnies and feathers instead of hooks and chains and Cenobites? Didn't think so. Speaking of Cenobites, those people(and/or demons) kicked [butt]!...though I would never enjoy becoming one...pins, hooks and chains tend to hurt a bit... But anyway, if you are looking for a suprisingly good film by an extreamly underrated writer, and if you have seen the first Hellraiser and are kinda sketchy about sequils, don't be! For this is a good one!!!"
3,"A Good Sequel, A Good Continuation","I don't know about Leonard Maltin, but I really thought this was a good sequel. It still delivers the thrills and chills. Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) is now in a hospital talking to doctors who think she is crazy. Little do they know. Dr. Channard gets the magic box and tries to get a mute girl to solve it. Big mistake. Instead of the cenobites going after her, they go after Dr. Channard.The cenobites are more evil in this one. The beginning shows how Pinhead got his name, and that they were all normal people before.This is a good movie to rent when you are bored and don't know what to do."
5,What a great sequel!,"This movie rocks. I couldn't belive that Clive actually made this film better than the original. The Cenobites are SCARY. I love how the character Kristy, returns with a strong will and she wants revenge. Pinhead's true face is revealed as well as the other Cenobites. This is truley a masterpiece, belive me I know my horror movies. Don't wait, buy this right now."
3,Not Up to Par,"Though this movie tries to follow in the first movie's footsteps, it fails in many area. Peter Adkins took a great idea and scattered it too far for anyone to piece back together. The beginning starts off well enough, but after Julia's resurrection, the film becomes confused and lost. The body count is higher, the blood flow more copious, but the story in general is flawed and ambiguous. The rest of the sequals weren't much better, eiher."
1,Dumb times 2 !!!,"Plot on these sequels does NOT make any sense --Annoying, boring and a total wasteof time, money, and energy !!!:o("
5,"NOW, IT'S TIME TO PLAY !","THIS IS A TRUE HORROR FILM, WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME, THE LOOK OF THE FILM, THE EFFECTS, ITS GORE, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT FRIGHTENS."
3,ok,This movie wasnt bad but i wish that i could really understand the hellraiser movies because i wish sumone could fully explain this to me
2,"RENT IT, BUT DON'T BUY IT","THIS TIME, KIRSTY [ASHLEY LAURANCE] GOES TO HELL IN SEARCH OF HER FATHER. I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS HERE.THIS MOVIE DOES GET A LITTLE BORING AT TIMES AND ON TOP OF THAT, THEY HAVE WAY TOO MANY FLASHBACKS TO THE ORIGINAL ''HELLRAISER''. THE MOVIE'S REDEEMING QUALITY IS ITS SCENES THAT INVOLOVE THE CENOBITES, WHICH DOES BREATH LIFE INTO THIS MEDIOCRE SEQUEL. FOR ALL FANS OF THE ORIGINAL WHO STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS, YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF JUST RENTING THIS ONE."
1,"THE WORST IN THE SERIES,HOPELESS MESS","This flick stinks,whats the deal with the confusing tale,now Pinhead teams with the Cenobites,Julia Cotton,and a crazed doctor to kill a traumatized Tiffany,Kirsty Cotton returns to help Tiffany.Tedious and derirative,almost every scene is full of gore.Rated R for Graphic Violence and Gore,Language,Brief Nudity and Sexuality."
1,Dont suport crappy releases!!,Yet again a gready company tries to flog consumers by releasing a crappy release.The movie itself deserves a decent release on Blu-Ray NOT an upscaled dvd.Do not buy this release.Save your money antil a decent release is out there.
2,"Not too bad, but I would have expected better","""HELLRAISER"" was a timeless classic. Now out comes a sequel to try and match the first. And of course, it fails. There were some scenes that made me sink into my chair a little, but it still just carries on with the entire plot of all gore, little imagination. And I would have thought that Clive Barker would do a better job of his vision of hell. In ""Hellraiser"" his vision of hell was an asylum of pain and terror, now all of a sudden it becomes a dirty and seriously boring labryinth.So, its just like any other horror sequel. It's plot is to ruin the original."
4,"Wow...so easy to install, great product","This is one of 4 mounts in our home. we used for a 32 inch vizio. I was worried with the cheap price that it would be awful, but it is AMAZING. works better than 2 of my articulating sanus mounts. Would buy again and again!"
3,Okay,The positive thing is I received the book very fast.The book contained nothing that I didn't already know.I was disappointed.
5,Algebra Unplugged,"I actually bought this book for my neighbor. You see she is going to a community college and is having a very hard time understanding algebra. I saw this book and downloaded the e-version onto my Kindle. When I started reading it I decided this would be the perfect book for her, explaining algebra in simple laymen terms. Since I am really good at Algebra I told her to read the book and if she has any question just knock on my door. I have to say I really like the way the author explains Algebra and he even adds some humor to it. So if you are one of those that you will never understand Algebra you need to get this book."
2,"This is for kids, not adults","dont bother with this book, unless you like that kids show ghostwriter. its the same concept."
4,My daughter loves this book!,"My daughter absolutely loves this book. It is always one of the first books she takes off the bookshelf in the morning. She knows the animals by name and has learned the sounds they make with the help of this book. She loves the touch and feel component of the book. Also, ""Quack Quack"" has held up well, through two kids, with minimal wear. The pages are sturdier than some board books. The only reason I rated this book at 4 stars instead of 5 is because on the last page,there is a kitten, and the text says ""Can you stroke the long fur on her tummy?"". The fur on the kittens stomach is extremely short, so it can be confusing to little ones learning the difference between long and short. I always leave out the word ""long"" when I read this book to my little girl."
4,A touchy feely book.,"The book is larger than Pat the Bunny. Small children love these touch books and it will give you another book for them besides Pat the Bunny, which I love best of all."
4,Great game but no support for Intel Macs,"We just got this game and, as always, installation went smoothly on our Intel core duo iMac. The display is great, even at the lower settings, and it's exciting and engaging.However, in playing as certain characters, the game would quit -- not go to the main menu but quit completely to the Finder. I sent a support ticket request to Aspyr, thinking that there could be a patch or upgrade for what I assumed is a bug, and was surprised to learn that because this is an ""older"" title (recently re-released, apparently, to appeal to new Mac users), it was designed to run on PowerPC and only that platform is supported. That's right: no support for Intel Macs.So, it's a great game but no fixes are out there (yet) for Intel Macs."
4,Great game -- big problems,"This game is great, but it continually crashes on my system, rendering it unplayable. I'm using a Powerbook G4, 1 gig processor, and it easily fits within the range of compatible systems. But at certain points the graphics disintegrate into a huge mess.So I'm forced to return a game I was very much looking forward to playing."
2,"Beware: GamePad ""not supported."" Aspyr support disappoints","I have really enjoyed this game on my brother's X-box. The Aspyr version promised similar game play but with improved graphics (the graphics are great)--and I didn't need to buy an X-box to enjoy it. I bought the iShockII GamePads to facilitate cooperative (2-person) play. The program automatically identifies the controllers and the manual tells you how to set them up. However they don't work. The characters always walk and never run when the controllers do not emulate the keyboard. This makes it impossible to sucessfully complete many levels.I wrote tech support and got this completely apathetic and misleading answer ""I can tell you that The Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King doesn't support gamepad or joystick play."" I think Ratburt is the tech support manager there."
3,So So,I have always been a fan of Zymol. Don't get me wrong they have great items. However this looks no better than the turtle wax that I bought for $3. It does last a bit longer than the turtle wax though. For the price I would not recommend.
3,good results not worth the price,For the price and the relative amount of w/y wax that you get i have had the same results with the titanium estate glaze which includes more w carn. wax than this one. These waxes are very very easy to apply and remove and give results that last a few months in the FL sun
5,The Mountain Fairy in Forest Meadow T Shirt,I couldnt resist purchasing this shirt when i viewed it. I had mixed feelings about how it would actually look in person considering the low cost of the actual shirt. I was not disappointed the shirt was made of good durable cotton and the actual design was more detailed and vivid than i had originally thought from looking at the photo.

4,Fairy nice,"My sister gave me this as a gift. It was quite large and I thought to myself.. I'm not THAT fat! Lo and behold, the magical fairy shirt conformed to my body and became one with me. I feel as if I could slay dragons and dance with elves while I wear this beautiful and comfortable fairy shirt! Thanks The Mountain for making even us big chicks feel chic!"
3,"fun book, but the ending falls short","I really enjoyed ""The Enormous Crocodile."" It is one heck of a tale. But the abrupt and rather too serious ending leaves me pondering the greatness that could have been.The story follows the exploits of the tittle character as he sets off one morning to find something to eat. He has a hankering for children from the nearby village. He broadcasts his desire to the other creatures of the jungle as he passes them.The only problem is that besides being greedy and ill-intentioned, the crocodile is also nasty to his fellow wild creatures. This comes back to haunt him.The story is a masterpiece of dry humor. Its verbal pacing is darn near flawless. The illustrations are great. Several (especially of the Crocodile's disguises) made me laugh.Outside of the ending, I highly recommend ""The Enormous Crocodile."""
3,A Funny Book with Silly Tricks,"I just finished The Enormous Crocodile by Roald Dahl. The story is about an Enormous Crocodile who goes through a jungle to a city, so he can eat children. I thought it was funny because the EC did some pretty silly tricks like when he pretended to be a see-saw. What I liked best about it was that the EC's friends warned the children or the town before the EC could hurt them. I thought this was a nice thing to do. The Enormous Crocodle is a good book to read. I would especially recommend it as a family read."
5,the enormous crodocile,"I purchased this book for my grandson who will be 5 years old in November. He adored the book and we have read it 3 or 4 times already. The artwork was outstanding with typical Roald Dahl language that children find endearing. My son was a huge Roald Dahl fan, and still is, so I purchased the book sight unseen and we have not been disappointed."
1,Joe's Review,"I did not like the ending of The Enormous Crocodile. I wanted him to go back to the pond instead of crashing into the sun. Please make The Enormous Crocodile better because up until the very last page I was enjoying the book. The pictures were very good but when I read it, the ending was terrible. That why I'm sending this letter to you. ..."
1,Joe's Review,"I did not like the ending of The Enormous Crocodile. I wanted him to go bakc to the pond instead of crashing into the sun. Please make The Enormous Crocodile better because up until the very last page I wads enjoying the book. The pictures were very good but when I read it, the ending was terrible. That's why I'm sending this review to you. --Joe Waldman, age 6"
3,Poor Crocky...,"I won't spoil it for anyone, but I liked that crocodile, his appetite notwithstanding. He had secret plans and clever tricks! <sigh> Let it be known here and forever afterward that I'm an enormous crocodile supporter, and I don't think the poor guy gets a fair shake at the end of this book."
5,Good book,I bought this book for the grandkids ages nine and eight and they loved it. I will buy more Roald Dahl books.
5,One of Roald Dahl's Best,We have read this book many times with our 4 and 6 year old boys. They absolutely love the pictures and the story. We've also listened to the audio version read by Roald Dahl himself and it is also awesome. We love this book. And we received it in very good condition and very fast from Amazon for my son's book exchange in 1st grade.
4,The Enormous Crocodile,"`The Enormous Crocodile' is one of Roald Dahl's big format books and has large colour illustrations throughout. Following an enormous crocodile as he forms various plans to eat local children and how these are foiled at every turn, you will delight in the imagery and turn of phrase used to describe this tale. This is a book that is perfect to read out loud and to share the pictures with little ones. It is also a great book for your first forays into reading alone. Dahl does it again and shows how he was truly the master of his art. Exceptional Enormous Crocodile adventure.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,pleasant surprise,"I've always appreciated Tony MacAlpine's neo-classical shredding technique if not the music, so when I chanced upon CAB in a specialist jazz store in the sales I thought why not. I was more than pleasantly surprised as it fairly rocks and grooves in equal measure thanks to Dennis Chambers powerhouse drumming and Brunel's busy basslines. Over this MacAlpine lays down some tasty licks, although sometimes his tone veers towards metal. I recommend this to anyone who likes fusion in as done by Tribal Tech, and Billy Cobham on 'Spectrum'. I'll definitely check out CAB 2 and 4 on the strength of this one."
5,A layed back Macalpine,"This album showed that Macalpine, has more then just one way of playing. If you don't have this album then something is wrong with you. This is by far the best Cab album that was released."
3,go back to rap a lot,"not the best from bill, there are a few good cuts on here,bill needs to go back to rap a lot."
1,The worst album ever,This album really sucks. The only good song on it is the last song on the tape.
2,buchwick bill,This is not bushwick's best work. this cd is not a one star cd the cd should get 3 star's. there are a few song's that are good.
5,Educational and Fun!,"On top of helping people learn the meaning of ""hydrophobic"" this sand is just fun to play with. It's coating lets you shape it in the water but as soon as you take it out it's completely dry. It's like each grain of sand has a force field around it so it can't get wet! Great fun for science classes. I brought some into a college General Chemistry class and they were as fascinated with it as young kids are!"
3,"Pleasant, nothing special","Much like the first book in this 'Lens' trilogy, 'King' is well-written and has one or two fairly interesting characters. Unlike 'Lens', this volume has a plot.Once again the center of the novel is Nazhuret, reducing everyone else to stick figures. The character of Arlin stays in the background. For the purposes of this book all you need to know is that she's a woman and she'll fight for Nazhuret. Nothing else. The most intriguing character, Powl, is hardly seen.MacAvoy makes some baffling character decisions. The eunoch whose name I can't remember at one point appears to be in love with Arlin...but it's never revisited. It's never relevent.I suppose I don't care for MacAvoy's writing. The dust jacket shows several rave reviews for these books. I just don't see it. I can't fault her mechanics, only the intangibles."
4,Better than most,"This was not your run of the mill documentary that you might find on any cable network at Halloween. I found it to be filled with interesting facts and information on what it is like to be ""psychic"", to talk to ghosts, and to ""feel"" spirits. I'm glad they stayed away from silly reinactments and dealt with the subject matter seriously. At times funny, touching, creepy. Really good."
3,She's no Jane Austen,"I listened on tape, and while the narrator did an admirable job (although her Mr. Woodhouse made me cringe), the book just doesn't ring true. Emma is petty, and from her behavior in this book you'd think she hadn't matured at all before she married Knightley. The discussion of womens' roles is interesting, as is the new character Mrs. Tidmarsh, but then she acts out of keeping with the character as established. I just couldn't buy into it 100%. Time to reread the original again to feel back on track."
5,What an experience!,What an experience! Hard to believe it'a a true story. I'm amazed by the author's courage.
1,Don't buy this unless you know what you're buying!,"Very low resolution, super low quality graphics. Just nothing compared to more recent games.Don't be fooled by the title. This is just not worth your time and money.Moreover, you need Classic environment for Mac, which means installing extra stuff and is a real hastle for Mac OS 10.x users. Mac OS 9.x was the last OS that allowed for Classic environment games.And make sure that you don't just buy the CD from someone. There are other important things not included with the CD that are basically like CD keys that will not allow you to play the games unless you have them. It's possible to bypass at least one using information on the Internet, but it's a hastle and who knows what else you are missing out on if you only get the CD?"
5,Absolutely outstanding,"46 (yes 46) tracks, very beat oriented, seamlessly mixed although the sound quality could be a little better. A little heavy on '80's beats, but an outstanding funk-oriented collection of party breaks. One of a kind, a must-have."
4,Great Reading for All,Gregor and his sister Boots find themselves falling into a sticky situation when they fall through the basement of they're apartment where the meet the crawlers or as we call hem cockroaches and not the normal tiny ones cockroaches that are four feet tall. The cockroaches take them to the arena where they meet Luxa. Luxa takes them to the prophecy room where Gregor learns that he must go on a quest.
3,"Eh, it was okay.","I'd give this a 3.5 based on personal preference. This is a middle grade novel, but sometimes it read as though it was speaking to a five year old kid. There was a good moral to the story, but it still wasn't my favorite."
5,Great on audio,"Another audiobook read that I found incredibly enjoyable. With adventure around every corner, Gregor the Overlander explores a world where humans and large rats are at war. Our hero Gregor has no interest in becoming the hero but must to protect his little sister and find his way back home. An epic new series awaits me and I cannot wait to read more! One of the fourth grade teachers at my school reads this to her students every year and no wonder why. It's such a great tale of fantasy and adventure."
2,Not the same caliber of writing!,"I kept reading as long as I could. I gave it a huge chance, too many used and re-used sci-fantasy notions and ideas. If your looking for more of Suzanne Collins work to read after you finish The Hunger Games, I suggest waiting for new work. She has obviously grown and matured as a story teller since the publishing of these novels."
4,good quick read,"For me, this was a quick read (2.5 hours). I will be recommending to the school librarian to get if she doesn't already have (I work in a middle school) will also see if my 10 year old would like to read it."
3,Ok,It's ok for a young reader. I would recommend it for tweens or middle school students. Story line went quickly with not enough detail or history to support the plot.
3,Gregor the Overlander a Great Book,Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins is a great book. It has a lot of action and suspense. Gregor is the main character. He and his sister fall down a hole in their laundry room in New York. In the underland they meet many strange creatures and they venture on a great quest. I the underland they have rats and bats the size humans. They are many times when they are in a bind and only escape by luck. Overall I think this is a great book and I think it should be a Newberry honor book.
4,Gregor the Overlander Book Review,"Gregor the Overlander is a great sci-fi book with adventure, action and lots of twist and turns. It first starts out that Gregor and his little sister Boots are doing Laundry in the basement of his apartment complex. Then Boots falls down a shaft and Gregor jumps in after her and when they get down there they see all kinds of giant cockroaches, bugs, spiders, big bats, and huge talking rats. Gregor soon finds out that he is in a prophecy and on the adventure to he runs into to all kinds of problems, surprises and trouble. He soon finds out that the giant talking rats have his dad imprisoned and he goes to save him. In conclusion gregor the overlander is a very good book with adventure and surprises."
4,Gregor the Overlander,"Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins is an amazing book. This incredible book is about a young boy, Gregor, and his toddler sister Boots who plummet down a laundry grate into a mystifying Underland full of unusual creatures. Gregor and Boots are welcomed by enormous cockroaches and violet eyed, human-like people. Gregor is stunned when a wise man named Vikus tells him he might be part of a prophecy that includes him, Boots, and other creatures. Gregor is puzzled when he learns this and just wants to go home, but it seems he has no choice. Gregor then leaves the Underland city as well as his company of Underlanders, Boots, and beasts that are supposed to go with him to save the Underland from a horde of massive, oversized rats that have attacked the major Underland city. See what happens in this extraordinary book, Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins."
2,I'M THINKING THIS WAS A YOUNG ADULT BOOK. STILL IT WAS INTERESTING. I'DD THINK TWICE ABOUT CONTINUEING THE TRILOGY.,I'M THINKING THIS IS A YOUNG ADULT BOOK. STILL IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. I'D THINK TWICE ABOUT CONTINUEING THE TRILOGY.
3,Simplistic let down of an ending,"The books is definitely for kids 8-12, not for anyone older. Some books can transcend age, but this cannot. There are interesting concepts in the book. It is very derivative however. It reads like a pint-size Lord of the Rings, for one thing, or any other of a number of books. The biggest problem for me was that after all the build-up, the ending was a total nothing. It took about ten minutes for them to get home, and I was left thinking, ""Why didn't they just tell his father how he could leave in the first place? Then he wouldn't have run away."" And the fact that the rats kept his father literally for years while he made a few weapons that did not work for them was also ludicrous. The book is not badly written. It is just not overly creative or well-ended."
4,Big Bugs,"Gregor the Overlander, by Suzanne Collins, is a intense book about an eleven year boy who is pulled into the Underland. I was at first curious when he started to fall slowly downward towards the Underland and the currents sucked his little sister into the Underland he then was kidnapped by roaches. I thought that it was strange that the cockroaches thought that boots was a goddess and helped her all the way through the book. I thought that it was neat that the rats could smell everything extraordinarily well. The best part of the book was when the root beer hit the spider in the fangs causing it to drop Luxa the queen of the humans. I do not know which I disliked more the ending of the book or how the people die."
3,Previous review,"From previous reviews was expecting more. The review stated good book for all ages. Being an older person I figured I would give it a try. But it was a little to young minded for me. The book however was okay, not interesting enough for me to be a page turner."
4,needed more time to develop,I thought the plot developed to quickly and was to short. But it was a nice and pleasant tale. Enjoyed it but not a masterpiece or something I'm itching to read again.
4,Quick Read,This book gets straight to the action. There is hardly a dull moment in the book and it will leave you with whiplash from moving from one event to another. The ending leaves you wanting more so if you are into series than buy this book. I can't wait to buy the rest.Oh... and beware of the pests.... and large holes in the ground!Gregor the Overlander Collection (Books 1-5)
4,Great book for older kids,"Great book, that you won't want to put down can't wait to get to the 2nd and 3rd books. Great for older kids."
2,Not sure about this one.,"Trying hard to get into this book, wondering if I want to continue reading or not. Will it become more than giant cockroaches and monster rates?"
3,Fast Read,"Nice little story.Easy and fast reading. More suited to younger folks. I loved the Hunger Games series though, by same author."
3,Not just for young adults,"I was immediately drawn into this book where insects, bats and other animals talk and interact with each other and the humans in the story. I instantly fell in love with Boots & Gregor and found myself believing this underworld to be a fascinating place.The prophecies are quite a challenge to interpret and add to the story.I am currently on the third book and can't wait to read the rest. I am anything but a young adult but didn't find the book condescending."
4,its great! Lots of fun!,"I bought it because it was a great deal and I had been reading very ""heavy"" stuff. I enjoyed it so much that I am reading the second one, they are great fun and a nice light story, I would recommend these for anyone young or old."
5,My Oh My...,"My oh my. I read this book three years ago and fell in love, but when I read the Hunger Games I never made the connection between a sort of childhood hero and inter-national sensation! If truth be told, I barely figured out today! This captivating tale of so many emotions and other such things is so different than the Hunger Games. No offense, but I feel this book is more descriptive along with a very friendly read. I highly recommend it to all young people who want some daring adventure!"
4,Gregor the Overlander Rocks!,"Gregor the Overlander is the best book ever! Gregor the Overlander is about a boy named Gregor, and his sister Boots. They live in a regular family except for one thing, their father went missing about two years earlier. They are in the basement one afternoon when they get sucked into a grate in the floor. They fall for what seemed like hours when they softly land at the bottom. There they meet some strange creatures such as giant rats, giant cockroaches, giant bats, giant mice, and even giant spiders. They also meet some strange people such as Luxa, the future queen of Rigalia and Vikus, Luxa's grandfather. Gregor finds he is in a prophesy to save the Underland. Does Gregor go home like he should, or does he go on this quest to save the Underland? Read the book to find out!!!"
3,"Gregor the Overlander, an Okay Book","Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins was an okay book. I liked it because it was full of excitement and the setting was creative, but in my opinion some parts were too descriptive and some of the characters didn't appeal to me. This book is about a boy named Gregor and his little sister named Boots. They live in New York City with their single mom and grandma. One lonely day Gregor and Boots fell down a hole in their washroom and they found themselves in a very creative setting, the Underland. It was suspenseful from the time they fell down the hole to the quest for Gregors missing father, which I thought was a little bit descriptive. This book had its ups and downs. Although it was sometimes boring, there were definitely some parts that were fun to read. Overall this book was okay."
5,My 11 year old daughter loved it,I purchased this book for my 6th grader after she read the Hunger Games Series and was looking for something else to read. She loved the Harry Potter Series and the Hunger Games so I thought this book might be a good fit. She must have read the book in less than a week. She wasn't sure she was going to like the book based on the description but I encouraged her to read it anyway. She has been bugging me to purchase Book #2 every day for the past week.
4,safer read than Hunger Games,"Having read the full Hunger Games series before starting the Gregor series, I must say the Gregor books are more appropriate for younger audiences. Yes there is still death, but not like the morbid assumption that drives the Hunger Games.The underworld of book 1 is richly described and well conceived. And the characters are almost believable. The fact that I am now on book 4 supports the notion that Suzanne Collins has created a sustainable compelling universe and story line."
4,Good Book,"I first saw this book in my sons Scholastic book order. I was familiar with Suzann Collins writing from the Hunger Games trilogy and I loved those, but I was hesitant because these were kids books. I read the reviews and saw that some other adults had read it, so I gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised how they have kept my interests. I have read 3 of 5 of The Underland Chronicles so far and I can't wait to finish the series. Great books!!"
4,Underland Chronicles,I was hooked after the 1st book. I wanted to keep reading so I could get to the next one. The only thing I would like to see is the 6th book.
5,Enjoyed the book,I enjoyed the book very much. The story moved quickly and it ws easy to read. I enjoyed using my imagination .... it was a lovely diversion.
4,stirs the imagination,"I realy enjoyed this book, it captures and stirs your imagination. The concept of another world beneath our own is not a new one but this story handles the premise in an exciting way!"
4,Hooked me,"This was a free book, and I enjoyed all three of the Hunger Game series, so got it, read it. It is definitely a book for pre teens, but I liked it. Suzanne tells a good story, so good that I wish the following books were free. I may have to spring for the whole series (need to know what happened) So, I'm hooked; never should have fallen for the ""free"" book."
4,Gregor page turner,"[[ASIN:0439678137 Gregor The Overlander (Underland Chronicles, Book 1)] A very fast pace book to read. Keeps the reader intrest. A very clever imaginary world has been created. Looking forward to Book 2 in the series."
4,Fun easy read,This a fun young adult fantasy novel. It is easy to read and includes some mild violence that is age appropriate and not graphic. The story is fast paced and has lots of twists and turns. It is enjoyable for and adult or a teen. Not as good as the Hunger Games trilogy (by same author) but still worth the read.
4,The Underland Chronicles #1 Gregor the Overlander,I enjoyed this book even though it was pretty far fetched. It still kept my attention and the first book that I have read by Suzanne Collins.
4,Adventurous read,"What an entertaining, imaginative story. So different than Hunger Games, but just as addictive and sad. I look forward to the next book in the series."
3,The Underland Chronicles #1: Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins,"I chose this book because I like Suzanne Collins work. I liked it, but was also grossed out by all the bugs. I don't like bugs!I think that adolescents would enjoy the story, but of course there are many adults who like this genre, like I do."
4,A Fun Read,A rollicking and outrageous adventure written in a simple way. Perfect for adventurous young readers. I look forward to reading more of this series.
3,Entertaining,I read it to the end. I found it entertains. But it is not the quality excitement of The Hunger Games.
4,"Fantastic fantasy fun with spiders, riders, rats and bats","Eleven year old Gregor, missing his over two years absent father, takes his two year old sister Boots with him to do the wash in the laundry room of their New York City apartment. She falls through an air duct and, trying to save her, he follows. Down they fall to a fantasy land where giant-sized (good) bats and (evil) rats live with cockroaches, spiders and other Underlanders some of human form. A prophecy seems to point to Gregor as the likely ""warrior"" predicted to arrive and lead a quest which may bring back ""light"" or bring back ""none."" Unfortunately, it also spells death for two-thirds of the participants slated for the journey. Before it's through there will be danger, diapers, a bug-befriending toddler, treason and...well, that would be telling, wouldn't it? Read it and see what happens, you'll be glad you did."
2,Sad to discover how subpar this is,"I'm guessing lots of parents like me, and kids too, are giving Gregor a try after reading and loving the Hunger Games books. There's a reason this was never popular though. I couldn't even pay my middle grader to read this AND I TRIED. It's subpar, rather less than average, and not even in the same league as Hunger Games. Two stars though is probably a little low, especially considering some of the utter dreck I rated 1 star recently. Amazon should have a negative rating for those kinds of books."
3,Gregor the Overlander,"Gregor the Overlander is a must read for action/fanicty lovers. If you choose gregor the Overlander you will be making the best book choice of your life. Gregor the Overlander is about a boy named gregor and his little sister Boots. They live in New York City and gregor and his little sis are stuck at their boring apartment for the summer. One day they fall in to a hole in there basement and finds out that he had landed in another world. When in the under land he finds out that his long lost father is somewhere in this land to save his father he has to fight rats and other horrible creatures. So if you have some extra time go and buy this book that will take you in to a world of action, and suspense."
5,Outstanding book,"Gregor the Overlander and the other Underland books have become the most popular books in our home. I am amazed at how well Suzanne Collins develops her characters. Even the minor characters seem real. Suzanne Collins has created a world that feels alive. I could believe that the Underland exists. I liked the kindness that Gregor shows his family and how he has shouldered responsibility. He doesn't have super powers but he is strong. He's scared but does what needs to be done. He follows his heart. He's fallible but you want him to win. Underneath the quests and other dangers, there are questions about right or wrong and necessities of war, and repercussions of our actions and decisions...so much to think about. I loved it. My sons ages 7 and 9 loved it. If you get a chance to listen to the recording, the guy who reads the books is fantastic!"
3,"The Novel you won't Forget, Gregor the Overlander","Gregor the Overlander is an action-packed, fast-moving novel by Suzanne Collins. It is about 11 years old boy, Gregor and his sister, Boots who discovers a portal to the Underland. The Underland is filled with creepy creatures such as: giant spiders, bats, cockroaches, and rats. He also discovers a prophecy that explains his role in the Underland. He fulfills his prophecy in a series of exiting, page-turning adventures. Gregor find out a secret about his past. This is a great read for big and small, tall and short, the novel you will not forget."
5,wonderful reading,This book takes you into your imagination. This would be a great book to read to your kids. I highly recommend this book to parents if they enjoy reading to their kids. This would also make a great gift.
4,"Engaging, easy read","As an adult who likes the occasional pre-teen book between heavier reads, this book was great. It was a quick and enjoyable - not sure how some parents may feel about the killing scenes, otherwise a definite recommend. As soon as I finished, I ordered and read the rest if the books in the series. Enjoyed them all."
4,Gregor.The.Overlander,Nice read. Looking forward to reading it again with my son in the future. Even as an adult I found the book keeping me entertained.
5,Lovely Book,"the book was rather sad in parts but was full of action and suspense. Suzanne Collins incorporated regular household pests [spiders, roaches, bats] into being heroes. i loved the book and would recommend it to fiction lovers and people who LOVE reading suspense."
4,Underland Chronicles.,After reading the Hunger Games series I wanted to read more of Suzanne Collins. I am impressewed with her prolific imagination. Looking forward to the rest of the Underland series.
4,Impressive,"It was slow moving at first, but then the adventure began. Some...or most was predictable, but in the end I really enjoyed it. Now for book two."
5,Childre's series by Collins,"At 11, Gregor's life seems to have hit bottom. His 7-year-old sister Lizzie gets to go to summer camp while he has to stay home with his grandma who is battling Alzheimer's and his 2-year-old sister Boots so his mom can go to work. His dad disappeared.Gregor didn't think he could feel any lower until he and Boots get sucked into Underland. This he hit rock bottom. They discover a world where humans exist normal size but bugs and rodents are giant and can talk.At first Gregor seems stuck in this hidden world, until he learns of a prophecy and the hope this his dad might also be stuck in Underland.This is a great page turner that I would recommend to upper elementary to middle grade."
4,Pretty Good,"I liked it, and it was good, but there were parts that I didn't like, one of them being how convenient everything is. They say it's difficult for someone to get back to the Overland, and then it turns out to be as simple as a bat flying them up. I suppose they could've been lying so he wouldn't leave, but then why did those other Overlanders they mentioned die, when they could've easily gotten out? Another thing that bothered me was when he **minor spoilers* tried to 'run away' from the Underland humans with Boots. He had absolutely no idea where he was going, and it was basically the stupidest decision ever. It could've been because he's 11, but I think even an 11 year old would have more common sense.I guess there are just some things in the book that I wasn't quite able to understand. But overall, it's a great book, and I'd probably recommend it to anyone."
2,Underland Review,This book was well written but it was not my style of book. I really like the author. I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,Great middle-grade read!,"Fast-paced, fun and imaginative. I didn't love it as much as Hunger Games, but the whole underground world concept was fascinating. The one thing that kind of bothered me is there's no explanation why the insects, bats and rats are so much larger underground than they are on the surface. I definitely want to read more."
4,"Suzanne Collins ""Other"" Books...","Book one in the Underland Chronicles proved to be a very well-written, first book by the well-known Suzanne Collins. This middle grade reader follows the adventures of a boy and his sister under the streets of New York City, amidst cockroaches and bats (which are good) and rats (which are bad). Prophecies are unraveled, trust is put to the test, and new bonds are made.I enjoyed reading this fantasy adventure, enough to purchase book 2. Although not as amazing a tale as The Hunger Games, you can still sense Collins style woven in this book, her amazing details, depth to character, and flawless storyline.Definitely another series to have in your library."
3,Not to bad.....,"This book is written well however it was way to 'young' I guess I could say, for my taste. Talking spiders and rats really have a way of limiting an audience. The story was cute and the characters were well defined it was just to hard for me to get past the talking roaches."
3,good for younger readers,"Personally, I didn't love this book. However, as a middle school teacher, I can see my students enjoying it. They've loved the Percy Jackson series and this is along those lines. If you are reading expecting The Hunger Games, you will be disappointed. It is not at all like that popular Collins' series.The story begins with Gregor getting sucked through to the Underland (he's from the ""Overland,"" hence the title). His baby sister is with him and they battle evil rats to fulfill a prophecy. It was not a difficult read, however, I found the Underlanders dialogue to be stilted and odd. It was, otherwise, very readable, with adventure and action. Gregor is a nice enough kid. There is nothing objectionable (ie: cursing, sex, etc.) in the book. It is well-suited for young readers who would, I think, enjoy the story more than I did. This is book one in a series and I can see some kids sticking with Gregor through the others."
4,After the Hunger Games,"After reading the Hunger game trilogy I wanted to read more from S. Collins. When I read the first of five books on the Overlander series I was not sure I wanted to continue but true to Suzanne Collins writings I got ""caught up"" and now just finishing the third book. I would recommend your reading the five book series on The Underland Chronicles."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed Gregor the Overlander, the first book in Suzzanne Collins' (The Hunger Games) Underworld Chronicles. Our hero, 11-year-old Gregor, gets sucked into the Underworld along with his 2-year-old sister, Boots. There he meets giant rats (the enemy), giant cockroaches, giant bats, and the human Underlanders with purple eyes. He sets out on a quest with some Underlanders to free his father who has been missing for two years and is being held captive by the rats. Scads of adventures and plot twists occur during the quest. Gregor is easy to like. Much of the book traces Gregor's progress from not believing to believing he is the ""warrior"" an Underworlder prophecy predicts. The narrative is written at a 9+ level. I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2,Gregor the Overlander book review,"This marvelous book is a great book for all ages. This book mostly took place in the Underland. Gregor (main character) and boots, his little sister, fell in a laundry chute down a tunnel. He ended up in a place called ""The Underland"". He goes on a journey to find his father with the unknown underlanders that he met when he accidently fell in the laundry chute. I hope when you read this book and you finish you will tell all your friends about it and you will learn to love it!!"
1,suck,this book was super de duper hard to get into. the author spent like half the book describing the main character. when the author actually got to the actually got to the action ther was a lot of it but there was a very short period of time for it (the action of course). i really think this book deserved negative stars. But that is just my opinion which i believe is the right opinion.
1,The Underland Chronicles #1,"I did not give this more than a one star because I have not yet read this book. I have several other books that I am working on and will consider reviewing ""The Underland Chronicles #1"" soon."
4,Gregor and the Book Review,"Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins is an exciting and adventurous book. The story introduces the main characters, Gregor and his youngest sister Boots. It's a boiling day in Manhattan and bored to death while his younger sister gets to go to away camp. Well, to kill time Gregor chooses to go to the laundry room to wash clothes with Boots. When they get there both of them suddenly fall into a pitch black, endless hole until they finally land in a strange world underneath the New York ground. The Underland. This strange place has people flying on bats, fighting rats and even talking to cockroaches. Gregor suddenly finds out he is this special boy in prophecy to save his family, himself and the Underland. Gregor the Overlander will never have you bored with all his adventures."
4,Imaginative journey worth taking,"My 10-year-old son and I have read the first and second books in this series together, and can't wait to get to the 3rd. I love the world the author has created, and my son loves the adventure. He's studying Redwall in school, so it's great for him to compare & contrast how rodents are portrayed in the two series. Gregor is a terrific hero for a middle schooler to get to know; full of courage, doubt, fear and resposibility. I'm guessing girls would like this as well, with the troubled but noble young queen Luxa."
4,Gregor the Overlander Review,"The book I read was called Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins. It is a good fantasy novel set in the present day in a land miles under New York City. It told from the point of view of Gregor.In Gregor the Overlander Gregor falls down a laundry shaft into an unknown world where the only humans have pale, veiny skin and violet eyes. They ride huge bats and have befriended the crawlers, which are like giant cockroaches, spinners, which are massive spider, and six foot long rats. Gregor, along with his sister Boots and many others, embark on a quest to kill the rat's leader and rescue Gregor's father as the Prophecy of Grey predicts.My favorite part is the end, but I can't tell you that, sorry.I would give this book a 4 star review out of 5 because it was a good fantasy/adventure and I like this kind of book. It is appropriate for ages 8 and up because a few creatures die and they mention blood."
3,Not the Hunger Games,"Having read the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins in a matter of days, I bought the first book in the Underland Chronicles series. I was hoping to find another great series. This is not a book for you if you are looking for something like the Hunger Games! The story told in this imaginary world is OK, but not gripping. I will not be reading the other books in the series.As a caveat, I feel I need to say that I am not a young adult reader, being in my 20s. If you are buying the book for a teenager, this might not be the review for you."
3,memories of Narnia,Though this book was well written and I liked the story line I kept thinking it reminded me of the Chronicles of Narnia. But I still plan to read all six books of the series. Just have to find out what happens!
4,Teen book club review,"We are a group of 12 to 14 year old girls and we decided to read Gregor The Overlander this month for our book club. One of the girls thought that this was even better than Suzanne Collin's Hunger Games trilogy. A couple of us have siblings the same age as Boots and we agree that she was cute as well as realistic. We all enjoyed watching the prophecy unravel and one of the girls paticularly enjoyed figuring out witch charecters were going to die. It is somewhat predictable though not enough to ruin the plot. We liked how they processed old fashioned customs, however we agreed it would have been more realistic if they had changed more over time. Everyone loved the bonds between the bats and the people. We all enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the rest of the series. Fly you high!The girls of Blue Moon Book Club."
3,A realistic Underworld,"It's not like ""Tunnels"". Suzanne Collins's novel has the power of bringing the reader in a world where everything seems so real despite the giant rats and bats and unbelievable situations. There are strong characters and interesting turning points. But I found the plot a little bit trite: the unlucky boy who finds his way and become an hero in order to save a world."
4,Great book for your teenager,"I decided to try another book by the same author as the Hunger Games.I was pleased with The Underland Chronicles #1. I think it is well written and kept my interest for the whole book. I recommend it for most teenagers, those who are interested in reading about new places and strange things.Gregor The Overlander (Underland Chronicles, Book 1)"
4,"Very handy, but with a Caveat","I thought this was a nicely written book. She gives a bit of history, which I really liked, before moving into discussing the tools and technique. I took a class about 15 years ago and bought this book to refresh my skills. I don't know that I would be able to master Copperplate with just this book alone without having had hands-on lessons, but that might just be my learning style. Regardless of the fact, this is a book to have in your library of you are interested in fine penmanship."
1,Not very good.,"This book (As many others ) do not teach the true forms of the letters used in the early 19th century. There are lot of cute swirls and many other things but for a person who has study Engrosser's Script (Copperplate) and has seen the examplars done by the great masters of calligraphy, this book will teach you Mrs. Winter's personal approach to the letters (which I respect) but as a calligraphy lover and as a person trying to keep this beautiful art alive I can only suggest you try the books written by masters.... like the Zanerian Manual. Once you have mastered the script taught in the Zanerian Manual you can easily duplicate most hands, including the one on this book."
5,Wonderful,"First you must know that the LC display color isn't green but blue, which for me is better.This little gadget is very useful to store your photos in a trip or when you're on the field. It's fast as reads lot of memory cards. In my case I'm using Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) and all is perfect.You can use this device as a portable hard disk as well. And with the 80GB capacity there are lot of stuff you can save.You can't view the photos, but for this price what are you asking for? Just look at the portable media players and you'll find that anything with the capacity to show the pictures will cost you three times more.Digital Foci PSF-250 Photo Safe is the perfect friend for serious photographers."
3,Digital Foci Photo Safe picture storage,"There's one major glitch with the Digital Foci... there's no notification after you download that says everything went ok. I like a little positive confirmation before wiping my flash card clean, saying my images were copied and there were no errors."
2,"Easy to use, but battery and cable poor quality","This digital photo safe work very easy and friendly. The problem is that the poor quality of the cable and the battery, the limitation of battery life is very short, so it force me to buy an extra battery, to have the work done. I'm a semi-pro photographer and I choose to work with a mini note book, instead using this item.I don't recomended because of the quality of the power surce."
4,IT WORKS!,"THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE INSTRUCTIONS. THEY ARE MINIMAL AND WITH POOR EXAMPLES. YOU DO FIND OUT HOW IT WORKS BY EXPERIMENTING WITH SOME PICTURES. YOU ARE NOT SURE IT IS SAVING EVERYTHING OR HAS TRANSFERED EVERYTHING UNTIL YOU DO SOME CHECKING WITH YOUR COMPUTER. HOWEVER, ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, IT IS GREAT ON LONG TRIPS FOR SAVING A LOT OF SHOTS. TOOK OVER 300 SHOTS INN THREE DAYS IN N.M. AND EVERYTHING WAS THERE WHEN I GOT HOME."
5,Great whistle,"I purchased this whistle to ref town team volleyball games through the fall. I used it many times and love it. It's lightweight and small; which makes for an easy time of refereeing! The best part is the Cushioned Mouth Grip, no more biting plastic or metal that bother my teeth. Highly recommended!"
3,Season 6 of Home improvement,Brought season 6 of Home Improvement and disc 2 didn't even work. It wouldn't even go past the anti privacy warning and you can't fast forward it either. Returned it and I hate that I won't be able to finish my collection cause there are some really great episodes in season 6.
4,"Very good, not the best season.","I own seasons one through six now. First off, I bought the sixth June of 2011, and all of the discs worked perfectly.I find that the sixth season has a lot of quality humor, but it starts to feel a little forced in this season. I believe that's because they decided to make the show more dramatic, with AL's wedding, Brad and Randy's girlfriends, Jill's dad dying, Tim's Mom moving out of their old house, etc. Some of my favorites are when tool time is being sold to sweden with a Drew Carrey cameo, the ""routine"" episode showing Tim and Jill when they are extremely old, and the halloween episode. Another downside with this season is that Jill seems to be hoarse the whole time."
1,Season 6 Major Disappointment,"I own seasons 1-5 and am very happy with their quality and very COMPLETE episodes.Season six was only in my collection for about 24 hours, I returned it to the retailer for a full refund!""The Complete sixth Season""??? I think Mr. Tim Allen himself would be disappointed to learn that more than a few scenes had been omitted from many episodes in the sixth boxed set. All of the episodes had scenes that had been re-edited. A few to the extent that they fade to black between dialog! It's like a stand-up comedian telling the wind-up of a joke, then walking off the stage before delivering the punch-line."
4,Problem with Disc 2,"This is one of my favorite shows and the content is great. But, the video quality on disc 2 leaves something to be desired. Movement blurs and flickers. The video on the other two discs is normal. Disappointing."
1,Home Improvement dvd doesn't scan,"this is the third Home Improvement 6th season I've bought and will have to return. there is something about the layering or scanning that prevents the player from reading the disc properly, and consequently, there are episodes i can't watch."
2,Buyer Beware,"I like this show well enough, but I've never been obsessed with it to the point that I would notice the first time something was missing. That said, I did notice some of these episodes seemed rather short. Then I found this review at sitcomsonline:Buena Vista had been doing a rather decent job of releasing this series on DVD, but then they decided to release the sixth season in a cheaper package than the previous releases. Of course, packaging shouldn't immediately cause alarm, but then you get inside the package and discover that nearly half of the episodes have this bizarre video compression problem. Then, on top of that, they use syndicated versions for an unknown number of episodes? Does everybody know what time it is? Time to ditch this set!Okay, so that's why some of the episodes seem short...because they are short."
2,Not what I was expecting....,"I have to tell you, I found the first four seasons hilarious. In this Sixth Season I find the acting strained at best. It seems the writers were grasping for some fresh ideas. Good thing they reduced the price, though I still think it is not worth it."
4,singles book,"Of interest to singles and those supporting them emotionally, etc. Well constructed, pricing satisfactory, delivery good."
4,One for the boys,"Well as a bloke, ladies, its sort of tradition that we do the asking out. This can be sheer hell for a quiet bloke like myself!!! Ms Tucker has done a very good job of presenting dating and getting hitched as a task like any other. The philosophy of ""when you are not looking it cums"" is rubbish, especially for a boy. Tradition states we should be the movers and shakers, but that doesn't make it any easier. I wish I was rich enough to sit with an analyst all day and look at all my baggage but I'm not, so this book has really put me in the driver's seat. Buy it through amazon and save embarrassment for yourself.Sputnik Sweetheart"
4,[...] dollars for a toy?,I have had this toy for as long as I can remember.The claws on most of the arms have come off except for the claws on the top two arms that are stuck to the arms.I gave up looking for the claws to the other arms a long time ago.This toy is realy basic the elbows arent able to bend and one of the mechanical arms is tearing which is why I marked it down for durability.This toy is worth fifteen dollars at the most which is why I am shocked to see it on amazon for a hundred dollars.I am not saying this toy is'nt fun but its not worth a hundred dollars if your kid cant live without a dock ock buy them one from the traditional series.
1,Not Good,Arms pop off and do not go back on easily. Not very poseable. Good toy if you want to keep it in a glass case.
4,MY GRANDSON,"I PURCHASED THIS TOY FOR MY GRANSON. HE LOVES IT DEARLY. HE COLLECTS ACTION FIGURES AND WAS SO EXCITED IN GETTING IT. HE IMPATIENTLY WAITED FOR THE MAIL. WE WERE HAPPY WITH IT COMING SO SOON AND IN SUCH GOOD CONDITIONN. IT WAS A LITTLE PRICEY. BUT, HE IS WORTH IT. THANK YOU."
4,Love Hint water but do Not like the Price!!!! :(,"Hint water is great, but way to expensive!!!!I don't understand why it's so much money and why it's not less expensive if purchased by the cases!!!"
4,Exactly as the name states it is.,"It's just a hint of flavor, nothing more. It took a few cases to get used to it. If you are used to Vitamin Water or similar, you will think this is bland. I wanted to get awa from artifical sweeteners and after a couple of months of this, Vitamin Water and even SoBe Lifewater now seems too sweet. Try it, but understand it is NOT Vitamin Water or SoBe."
3,"It's OK, too pricey for the low taste",I was hoping that there was somehow a flavored water drink with good flavor without sugar or chemicals. I am still hoping. Hint does have exactly hint which is what I should of expected. It's just too expensive of a drink to buy when it really doesn't taste much different than regular water.
5,very refreshing,Sometimes its nice to drink water with subtle flavor and no calories. But the best part is no artificial sweetners/chemicals.
1,Hint Water,"I thought this water was terrible. I was very disappointed. It almost had a ""perfumy"" taste to it. Not something I would buy or recommend"
1,HINT...NOT EVEN!!,"I ordered four different flavors of ""Hint"". I HATE them all! Yes, there is a ""hint"" of flavor, but it tastes very ""medicinal"", not at all refreshing. In order to just get this stuff down, I have to add some Crystal Lite just to hide the awful taste! ""Twist"" by Talking Rain is a MUCH better choice and the price is also better because you get ""free shipping"", but with the Hint, it is just below the $25.00 allowance for free s/h, so you have to either buy a second case, or pay the shipping which is pretty steep. I don't recommend this product."
3,Brilliant acting by child actor Thivisol.,"What's brilliant about this film is the acting by Thivisol. According to several interviews and magazines, the director Jacques Doillon, took more than a year to shoot this film, while studying the child actors' behavior and attitude. In the middle of production, he would change the plot so he can match it with the children's behavior. Amazing filmmaking."
3,an emotional movie,"This movie, with a simple story line (actually there is not much of a story), played the emotional angle well. Thivisol was remarkably effective as Ponette. I grade the movie low because the story was hardly original (the most predictable and cliched ending played out at the end) and its effectiveness was dependent entirely on the performance of Thivisol. It also does not help that the DVD is not up to the expected standard: scene indexes are only accesible from the menu; only 1.33:1 ratio (the scene at the cemetery indicates that the original movie was in a wider format, with the planted flowers got cut off). On the positive side, the transfer quality is good, with sharp color, clear subtitles and economic, but effective sound."
3,Great Film - BAD DVD,"I wasn't sure how to rate this - It is a wonderful film, badly let down by ineffective use of the medium. I realise this transfer was probably made on a shoe-string, but would it have been overly expensive to make it available in widescreen? Or placing the subtitles in the ""subtitle"" track rather than inscreen?If you are outside the US, or have a multi-region DVD player, it would probably be worthwhile to wait until this is available from France, where I'd imagine more care will be taken in its provision. However, like I say, a great film."
2,"Movie is great, but yet another poor DVD.","I'll skip the movie itself review. You can easily tell that it's a great movie by all the other reviews. What I'll focus on is the DVD itself. One point for it is that it has a menu. It goes down hill there as the DVD only has Stereo sound. This might be due to the original's lack of budget but I began to wonder when I see this classic movie is only pan and scan. Fox/Lorber has seen fit to put hard subtitles whether or not we can understand French. This is a DVD which could have been a lot better. It's a shame that we get such great movies done in substandard DVDs. Bowfinger is going to be 16:9, Widescreen, and Pan&Scan; plus DTS sound & lots of extras. Couldn't Fox/Lorber have done this movie with at least a widescreen version and removeable subtitles? Look at A Better Tomorrow to see how good a foriegn film can be put onto a DVD. It's really a shame to have the shoddy DVD for such a fine movie. And it could have been so much more."
5,Bravo!,"I've seen this movie 3 times and love it more each time! Victoire Thivisol and the other young actors are so natural and convincing, it is difficult to believe they are acting. I found myself angry at the adults surrounding Ponette for their lack of understanding and support of this little girl's grief. Instead of encouraging her to express her emotions and fears in her own childlike way, they expect her to keep these feelings inside and move on quickly."
5,An amazing portrayal of loss from the eyes of a child,"This movie is so visually and emotionally stirring that you will find you no longer notice that you are reading subtitles. The performances in the movie are just incredible. I believed that this child had lost her mother. I wailed and sobbed with her. You will, too. Watch with a box of Puffs with lotion...you'll need them to catch your tears."
5,heartbreaker,"i have never seen a film before that churned so many emotions within myself.i consider myself a hard person but this film made me cry like a baby.a view inside the mind of a four year old girl who has lost her mum,the saddest film i have ever seen."
2,Almost a good atlas,"Each country (or group of countries) has a 2-page spread, and each map is centered on the spine, making that area of the map virtually unreadable. It was so unworkable, I had to return the book. Quite a disappointment."
1,"Not dangerous for children, but adults?","I first saw the book Show Me at the age of four. I was neither shocked or offended as I viewed it with pure innocence. Within 10 minutes I knew what sex was. Sexuality issues I later developed were not the result of viewing this book, but rather interactions I had with other people. However, it can be a very odd book for an adult to own. It may either say the parent is very progressive or a possible pedophile. I strongly believe their are two very distinct sides of the fence in this matter, one which is pure of mind and one which is very dangerous. When it comes from a loving parent, this book is a straight forward, honest approach to teaching sexuality."
1,BEFORE YOU BUY....,Consider how your peers would react to purchasing a graphic representation of children. The reaction may range from mockery to computer hacking in a vigilante manner.
3,Blast from the past,"I got this book in the 70's when I was working on a teaching degree. In one of my classes we discussed the uproar over it in depth and I wanted to see what all the shouting was about. I had it packed away with my old school books since 1977. I agree, it will offend a heck of a lot of people, but it's an interesting piece of history from the 70's. I'd look at it as more of a curiosity than something anyone would actually use with their children. Like ""Our Bodies Ourselves"" which also caused a lot of talk at the time, it is part of an era."
4,Excellent presentation limited only for the abence of chapters.,This is an excellent presentation of the global warming/climate change problem. The film then turns on Exxon and the Valdez Spill and Exxon's resistance to facing the climate problem. The film also reveals how difficult it is to get government action on the climate problem. I only wish that chapters had been formatted into the film to make it easier to review and to present to others. Without chapters one has to fast-forward and reverse to review parts of the film.
2,The Borderland = 2.5 out of 5 stars,"The Borderland is a nice little Outer Limits story. ""The Borderland"" is the 4th dimension that our scientist hero of the episode is trying to explore. He needs money to finance his project, so he shows his results to a man with dosh. Our millionairre friend agrees to finance the project on one condition, he believes that his departed son is ""somewhere out there"" and wants the team of scientists to attempt to make contact with him in another dimension. As always, the best laid plans go awry and a different outcome then hoped for transpires.I thought this episode had many good features, including: nice dialogue, solid acting, great sets, and a good pace. It was always pushing forward until the end.In short, ""The Borderland"" is about man pressing to quickly forward in science and when this happens, the outcome may be quite different then what was originally perceived.thank you for your time, David"
2,The second episode produced!,"A research team who successfully open a window into another dimension seeks more funding from a wealthy stockholder.Believing it to be the doorway to the afterlife, the stockholder agrees to fund their experiment provided they search for his dead son.This episode starts out interesting with Mark Richmans character revealing his two ""right"" hands to the stockholder. But once you throw in a ""Dr.Smith"" to try and sabatouge everything you get a well used plot. Good effects for its time, but not a very original storyline."
2,Style over substance,"While the photography is stunning (by Kindra Clineff, whose name is misspelled on the cover), the text is wishy-washy and pointless. There is very little specific information on the places mentioned (history, architectural styles, etc) but rather vague inspiration for the home decorator. It's likely I'm the wrong audience for this book, but I came away from it feeling like I didn't learn anything about New England."
2,Little Bit Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book so much - to finally read the conclusion to what was a great start in ""Brothers & Strangers"". The preceeding 3 books in this series were all great - good drama, good humor, good storyline and great character development. This one however seemed more like Ms. Halvorson was in a hurry. I was quite disappointed. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, and I could've easily put this book down. I don't think I will be re-reading this over & over like I have with some of her books like ""Let it Go"" or ""Dare"". Hopefully her next book reverts back to being great, rather than passable."
1,You get what you pay for,"This briefcase, priced at around $100 proves that you get what you pay for. The overall size of the case is fine, but the layout of the pockets is poor. The flap of the case seems to be of poor quality, the wrinkles on the leather are probably from the cardboard backing used inside the flap, a sign that it was made in China, and not in Italy. Spend more on a case and you will get a much better value."
2,Reviews are for a different recording!,"Dear Amazon, the reviews shown here are completely irrelevant to this recording. These MP3s are from a live recording by ATOPOS."
1,Doesn't Work - Use Pepper Nasal Spray Instead,"As a chronic sinus sufferer, you try anything that might be better than whatever you're using at the moment. So after reading alot online about colloidal silver, I tried this products and a couple others. They all don't work for me. I have found that pepper nasal sprays work best and that's what I recommend. Pepper works and silver doesn't."
2,Silver,"I gave this item 2 stars because I am sure it is what they say it is , but it did not help me at all."
1,Don't waste your $.,It seemed to worked for a few days and then it just stopped working. The main ingredient is water. It also seemed to sour after a couple weeks of attempted use?
4,Happy Birthday to Me..,My husband bought this sliver piece along with several other things ..I love the earrings.. the crystal heart is beautiful .. I love the length .. they arrived way before expected ..the negative is the actual.. post with rubber backing .. when looking at the picture we thought they were more fish hook type earrings .. I am afraid the rubber pieces will get lost .. then what ..it the earring meant to thread into the ear past the post> this is the first pair I have owned like this .. I wore them with the rubber backing they were comfortable.. and OH so beautiful ..
4,South Carolinian Revolutionary-Era (1759-1811) Biography,"Quoted from review in CHOICE, Feb.02: Modeled after Ulrich's A Midwife's Tale (1990), this life-and-times, detailed, and closely written study takes its starting point from her posthumous memoir, edited by her husband and published as a model for American Protestant women in the 19th century. As a strong-willed daughter of an American revolutionary leader and mother of 11, she fashioned a life that ""developed, elasticized and resisted the claims of patriarch and family."" The diary's silences, especially about slavery, were sometimes as eloquent as its formulaic language of pietism. Warmly understanding of her but frankly revealing her as an unexpectedly interesting subject. Useful and recommended for teaching early American history/ women/ religion."
4,Good for Reasearch,"This book has helped me give many reports on the subject of media violence. Stories from the book shocked me of how the media can influence peoples lives. I was really shocked about the story on the ""The Program"" how a kid actually lied on the middle highway line with oncoming traffic. Its a shame how he died doing that stupid stunt from the movie."
5,genuine woodland ladybugs,"These are not your ordinary orange brown asian beetles that you get at home depot, nor the flat beaked ones pictured from other parties, these are bright red and come with a full chiseled pattern on their black and white collar. The house container is an authentic replica of woodland environs, including woody string, hay, cottony stuff, and as long as you release the ones trapped by closing the lid all of them are healthy. Just don't keep them in the fridge for long, they will turn a rattly dull copper and with all the lightweightedness, static, etc., of death. Also, insecticidal soap seems to have brought down a large number of them on my roses"
5,"multi player golf is truly cool, BEST GOLF GAME EVER!!!","This years version put last years half baked attempt to shame,it's got tons of unlockable stuff,and skill points,TIGER WOODS 2002 is the best ,get a multi-tap,an have at it with your pals.get this now"
4,Good game but easy,"I picked up the game last weekend and have played it all week. That goes to show you that the game is AWSOME graphically and in gameplay. This is my first PS2 golf game but I have played the old school golf games. This is by far the best golf game I have ever played. I don't like the changing the ball spin in mid-flight nor do I like the Caddy tip on the greens. It makes the game TOO easy, I wish I could turn thos off. It only took me 4 days to beat all the Tournements and the Tiger Challeneges but the scenerios and the throphy balls are giving me a problem. I think they should have added the ball spin and left the grid greens like they used to be, to make it more of a challenge."
5,This game is off the hizzle,"This game is crazy. I am a big fan of golf games, but this one is unreal. The new analog swing is so much easier to use then the swing in previous years. It takes no time to learn and master. This game is has many challeges from the tiger challenge to trying to earn trophy balls (for long drives, a lot of birdes, a hole in one). The courses are so sweet. The music is even off the chains. The Nelly song #1 is the theme song for the game. I bought this game a week ago, and I literally have not put the controller down. Go out and buy this game now, ya heard me."
1,"Improved, but still lackluster","The Tiger Woods franchise has improved a bit from its dismal earlier days, but when you play this game, you ask yourself...where's the fun? Answer: If you don't care much about golf celebs, not much.This game is unrealistically easy. BAD golf physics. In almost no time I was shooting a 49...without really trying. How much fun is that? I guess if you're easily amused...Also, the game seems to lack the flair and fun factor of the Hot Shots series, or even new-kid-on-the-block Outlaw Golf. If you want to be stuffy and pretentious like real golfers, this is your game...if you want to have fun (and, ironically, a more realistic golf physics engine), go with Hot Shots 3."
4,Good for a Golf Game,"The graphics are better than average. There is some good competition and the courses look beautiful. TWPGAT 2002 has mostly realistic players but some fictional. The controlls take a little while to get used to but you will get the hang of it. In my opinion it is better than the Hot Shots Golf series. There is a new mode called speed golf which is very fun. In speed golf you obviously have to get the ball in the hole in a short amount of time and in as few strokes as possible. I also like the practice, tiger challenge and scenario modes. In the Tiger challenge mode you get to play 17 golfers om differnt courses. After you win each match you get to add on to your golfers settings (driving, accuracy, putting etc.) This game is fun and sort of addicting. I reccommed buying."
5,Forget the computer game-Stick with PS2,"While I was waiting for PS version, I picked up the computer game. After playing the computer game I was expecting the PS version to just be so so. I could not have been more surprised the first time I played the PS version. The over all looks and feel of the game is perfect. I really feel the PS version is much better then the computer. The computer has a ton of bugs and needs a state of the art computer to run. Even then the graphics are ok. The PS version runs right out of the box with out any trouble. The color is good and the game functions just like it should.The swing is much improved and the over all expierence is right on target. If you like Tiger and love to play golf, Tiger Woods 2002 Play Station 2 is the best golf out there, almost gives Links a run for its money. EA you did good. But you failed on the computer!"
3,Walela,Same songs in their CDs. We love their music but were hoping for different songs as well. Will continue looking.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this CD thinking it was a follow up to the first. Wrong. I love love love the first CD. I've been listening to it daily for over a month now and have turned others on to it as well. However, this CD just does not have the Native American flavor I was looking for. There's no magic. I am still listening to it, but the spiritual high I get from the first CD is definitely not present on one. All in all Rita Coolidge is still one of my favorite vocalists."
1,Unbearable songs...,"These ladies have some great vocals, but the Native American aspect here is a little overhyped. This CD is not the same quality as thier first, and is more gospel and country rather than New Age Native American."
1,Awful,"I've tried to order this CD as a gift for someone a few times now-I get a confirmation and think it's on it's way to me and then the seller KEEPS delaying the order, and by MONTHS! Terrible service-just don't offer it if you can't deliver the product. very annoying."
3,Disappointing but interesting album,"I thought that this album might be pretty good based on the high ratings it had been given but I was disappointed in it. Some of the songs make reference to the Cherokee nation, I expected that, but I don't think any of the songs have any Cherokee language lyrics. I do find some of the songs to be pretty good from a Country or Bluegrass standpoint (#9 When it comes or #10 When love was all we knew are examples of this) but I'd like the music with some songs to be less intrusive. I've also ordered the debut album, Walela, maybe I'll find it to be better, others have."
3,The title is misleading.......................,"Ms. Sarai is a wonderful writer of erotica....I just loved Raw Silk and Incognito but Ruby's Rules falls short of expectation.The story is centered on Ruby Chen a young sexually dominating CEO, her assistant Margaret, and corporate rival Rick Martell. We see the story unravel with all three characters points of view which was interesting except a little distracting. Although the book is called Ruby's Rules I felt like she wasn't much in control and the rules changed as often as the wind blew. Yet the book definetly explored BDSM and the roll of a novice dominatrix in Margaret, Rubies Assitant.Although, there was lots or sex I felt the plot and characters unravel as we came to the end of the book. I say the book could have been better considering the talents of Ms. Sarai."
1,Too Much Territory Too Little Detail,"This book is relatively worthless. Not only does it try to cover too much territory by doing all of Europe, it strays from it's intended purpose as a camping guide book. Most area descriptions are only a short paragraph long and have more info on area attractions than on the campgrounds (just check out all the activities listed in the index, unfortunately insufficient detail is provided for the activities as well). When I want info on area attractions I consult dedicated guide books such as Rick Steve's.As such only 1 or 2 campgrounds per area are covered (typically w/ only 1-2 sentence descriptions) and no info as to the size, quality, costs and exact locations of the campgrounds. No attempt is made to distinguish or recommend certain campgrounds; nor is any particular area covered in enough detail to give you a range of campgrounds to choose from. I found more campground info through local tourist organizations and the internet than I found in this book."
2,Bad Adverts,"This books says it does Eastern Europe, too. But it leaves out most of it only doing as far as Hungary. There was no way to tell about these limitations before buying it and so I'm very disappointed since I wanted Romania and Bulgaria too. And, of course, there is no Russia or other Baltic places. Phooey!!!"
2,too small for me,"these sunglasses have very nice,soothing lenses,but only a kid or someone with a shrunken head could wear them!"
4,pleased,"i like this a lot also bought some other stuff from the same place for my sons it arrived well packaged and i wasn,t dissapointed,niether were they.thx."
5,A taste of Bruce Lee's knowledge,"This book, though pretty short, does an excellent job of outlining Wing Chun's basics. The illustrations are well done and easily followed unlike so many other books of this type. The book is well worth the price if you are interested in Wing Chun."
4,Kung Fu in a nutshell! Bravo!,"To the dude who said it was not good for the beginner in martial arts, I totally disagree. In fact, as a new student of Choy Li Fut gung fu and not the wing chun that bruce lee practiced this book has greatly enhanced my training and knowledge. I have the Choy Li Fut kung fu book by Doc Fai Wong and it lacks many details on footwork and punches. Bruce Lee covered the basics which are essential for mastering any style of martial art or fighting for that matter. Yes, it is not 100% complete on wing chun and martial arts like for example it never mentions chau sau (sticky hands) or weapons training but it is great way to learn how to do the correct footwork, stances and core basics. A must for Bruce Lee fans and martial artists. Get this and the Tao of Jeet Kune Do for a wonderful training aid."
4,the basic chinese self defence presented by:bruce lee,"this short but essensive book represent the self defence techniques of wing chun kung fu before bruce developed the jeet kune do.those techniques are traditionally from wing chun.there are effective but some of them need a teacher ,and some can be easy to follow alone.anyway it is a very good and practical book. recommanded!"
5,Chinese Gung Fu,Great material. Very informative. Book will get much use out of on a daily basis as my son is into the arts.
5,It's called Sleepytime Tea FOR A REASON!,"There are many teas out there that say they are great for before bedtime. As a huge tea buff, I can safely say that this is the tea to drink if you want to relax and just pass out. It's amazing how fast the tea works because after a few sips, you start to feel drowsy. After one cup, you wish you had showered before you drank the tea because now you're just so sleepy!"
5,Good stuff,my wife had trouble getting to sleep....but after being introduced to this celestial - herb tea- she goes right to sleep...it works.
4,Sleepytime Can Help You Sleep,"Sometimes I have difficulty sleeping. I prepare a cup of Sleepytime and go back to bed and it usually works, helping me to sleep. The blend of chamomile and mint is really nice. A flavorful blend without any caffeine. A wonderful hot drink on for a chilly evening. Even if you are not having problems falling asleep or staying asleep, Celestial Seasonings' Sleepytime tea is a great drink. A little honey and mmmm.... The 40-count case of six is a good bargain too."
5,A nice up of sleepy tea,"This tea works great, especially if you use it at the end of a long and laborous day, just before you go to sleep, knocks you right out! LOL There is nothing in this tea to make you sleepy really, the most ""sleepy"" ingredient is the chamomille, as it is a proven stomach soother, and many people feel relaxed by it. I have drunk this tea many times during the day and had no sleepy effects. If your already sleepy, and you want to be relaxed by a nice cup of sleepy tea, then it will most likely work. Im not really knocking the tea, as I do like it, but there is nothing magical about it; you take it when your already tired, and it will help you relax if you believe it will."
4,Excellent JSS!,"I have not been a big Jeff Scott Soto fan until picking up the recent W.E.T. CD and this one. Wow - great ballads by JSS and his fellow composers/songwriters. All the tunes have great hooks, harmonies. Didn't care for ""4U"" too much of a lounge/soul song. Definitely a good one to picj up."
3,I really enjoy the an underated Craig Morgan,Craig Morgan's choice of songs is quite good and diverse. He especially is not afraid to include some excellet songs of a spiritual nature.
4,Great Album,Great album. There are a lot of really good songs on this album and it is very positive.
3,"Editor's selection of Gandhi writing, not chronological","Disappointed that Gandhi's writing was lumped together by topic selected by the editor, rather than by chronology, so you can't really see how his thought developed over time. Still a good selection."
5,Inspiring!,"""The Essential Gandhi"" is the most inspiring work I have read in a long time. Reading about the life of this most amazing man can be nothing short of inspirational. It makes me want to change my own life in so many areas. I give this work my highest recommendation."
4,A good autobiography,"This is the only book I have read about Gandhi and it was enough for me to get an overall idea about his personality. It's an autobiography written in a simple style which talks about all aspects of Gandhi's life: childhood, his marriage at young age, the time he spent in africa, so on and so forth. It is a good book for first time readers who don't know anything about Gandhi's life. I saw the movie 'Gandhi' right after I finished reading this book which showed clear differences between the content covered in both. The book is far better than the movie because it is more honest and detailed."
2,Ghandi on Drab...,"I love the man and the inspiration but trying to read this book was like chewing on cardboard... no, not that stimulating. Ghandi was a man of many extraordinary qualities, being every body's cup of tea was not one of them. :) I say that tongue in cheek because my difficulty with this book was NOT Ghandi himself, but my difficulty in relating to his sacred opinions and extreme self-sacrifice. An admirable man, but one I cannot find support or great guidance in only because I enjoy sex, food and SOME of the lifestyle luxuries and technologies of today. An inspiration far greater in video, than written word. A rarity indeed. To see the man, even in artificial film, was to understand far better than the distinction and definition words bring."
5,Best Gandhi book available.,"I have read every Gandhi book i could get my hands on, such as all his autobiographies, and this book is by far the best and just as accurate. With this book and the writings that are on his official website, you will have all the information you will ever need. One thing to keep in mind, that many people seem to forget, is that Gandhi was a normal man like you and me. He made mistakes just like every other man, but had the courage to always follow his 'inner voice' even in his unperfectness. This is a life changing book for those who dare to look within themselves."
4,"Very well organized, and informative","I really liked the way everything is laid out in this book, allowing you to read Gandhi's own words coupled with an explanation of events that was driving him."
1,Not impressed,"Received 2 containers, both contained minimum of 2 oz of cream. One container completely useless as it is clogged with ""old"" cream. Other container works fine, but cream does not appear to work any better than over-the-counter cream used for same purpose."
1,Didn't do anything,"I used it as it said to and as other reviews said to use it, and absolutely nothing happened. Not even a hair came off. I will stick to waxing."
3,Effective - but not 100% effective,"Good News - This is safe to use on ALL parts of the body - fear not, apply liberally. Also, hair is smooth and irritation free when growing out, no scratching!Bad News - Don't expect a brazilian. You're going to be left with very short spiky hair.Lessons learned - cut hair as short as possible with sissors first, leave product on for the full 20 minutes as a minimum and don't be shy - you're going to need a lot of this plastered on the entire area. Expect a second application after 24 hours to remove some more stubble"
1,burns,burns. did not work as well as other creams. Did not last any longer which was reason i purchased it.
2,Does not work as a hair remover,"This product does not work as advertised. It is not a hair remover as it does not remove hair. What it does is maybe softens and weakens the hair. At best it could be used as a step in hair removal process. If you would still like to try, go with Veet or Sally Hansen. They produce the same results with much better prices. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Know What You're Bidding On,"Ever heard of ""selective seeing?"" Well I saw what I wanted to see. I misread the title looking for the last unreleased Elvis Movie on DVD, ""Elvis On Tour."" I ordered two copies and to my displeasure they arrived and I read it correctly, ""Elvis On Elvis."" The film Elvis On Tour is still unavailable. Trying to make the best of this error, I opened and watched this DVD which boasted of having unheard and unseen Elvis footage. Wrong! This program featured some silent Elvis live performances overdubbed with nonrelated Elvis songs. There was nothing I didn't have. In short, there's no reason to add this to your Elvis Collection. It's just another piece of product for someone to make a buck off Elvis. Save your money. I give it two stars out of five."
2,Save Your Money,"This DVD sounded great, but if you're an Elvis fan, you've probably already seen everything on this DVD."
2,"Great text, poor copy","This version has NO illustrations, which is an important aspect of this work. Also, there are many mistakes in the re-printing, which make reading quite frustrating."
1,Boring,"This book was so boring, I couldn't get past page 79. I ended up pitching it. I gave it one star because I had to, I don't think it even rates that!"
3,It's OK product,"This product worked while I was using it, but 2 days later after finishing it I start again with that awful itching feeling. I'm not pretty convinced about the efficacy of this product. I have used it like 3 different times, and it's been the same. I have tried everything from creams to pills over the counter to prescribed creams, and some of them made my vaginal infection get worst. Right now, I'm taking Ultimate Flora Vaginal support plus I'm inserting one capsule of Femdophilus for 9 days. Let's see how this works."
5,Only Time: Collection of Enya (CD),I love Enya's music for it is so relaxing to listen too and when I found out that she had a box set available I was anxious to get it and add this collection to my growing collection of CD's at home.
2,Danger - does not play on all CD players!!!!!,"This is an ""Enhanced"" CD - WATCH OUT!These do not play on:a. Older CD playersb. ComputersWhy? Because the publisher has blessed us with all sorts of Software that automatically loads itself on to your computer. One reviewer noted only 3 hours of music on a 4 disk set.Why? Because they loaded Quicktime, screensavers and even a short cutsy ""movie"" of Enya.Because the CD is a few years old, it trys to load an older version of Quick time on your computer. While free updates are available, watch out. Unless you are a MacIntosh user, Quicktime is definately NOT good software. It wants to take over your Computer's media associations, etc.Also, these CD's will not play on some older CD players due to the presence of software.Do yoursellf a favor - Skip this Set. There are other sets available for less.Also, never buy ""enhanced"" CD's as they contain extra junk."
5,Awesome collection...,This box set deserves to be included in any Enya fan's collection. This set combines many classic favorites from Enya's extensive career and also includes an interesting booklet with the lyrics of each song.Perfection!
2,"Where is ""On My Way Home""?","That question sums up my feelings. They put every other song from her ""main"" albums on here except that one, which is...surprise...my favorite Enya track! Not buying this one."
1,What a bitter dissapointment!,"I cannot even begin to explain the dissapointment that I have with this box set.Like a previous review said before me, this is basically a recycled ""Box Of Dreams"" with a few added tracks and different style packaging. This box set had so much potential to be a wonderful gift but that potential was completely blown by merely including almost all of her regular studio album tracks and still excluding non-album tracks. Each of the four discs has enough space left for several more tracks and the leftover space could've been used to make a separate disc for a B-Sides disc.This is a great box set but Warner Brothers completely blew it with this release!!"
4,I enjoy this set..,"..but there are a few minor things to say against it. I think the packaging is kind of on the flimsy side because I have noticed that one of the CD holders on my box is coming off slightly. I'm disappointed that Oriel Window wasn't included on here. Other than that, they did good with the tracks that were included, all the tracks that I rave about are on here (with the exception of any contributions from Amarantine) The full color booklet included is a great bonus for the Enya fan. I have her CD's already, but I purchased this because it was a beautiful package despite its minor flaws..I love how they decided to use purple velvet. I would still recommend this, especially if you have none of Enya's work and you would like to hear some of what she's all about. It's right here. :)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is the third time that Warner Music has tried to cash in on Enya's polularity by producing ""a Best of"" album: Box of Dreams, Paint the Sky with Stars and now; Only Time.Enya has all in all release 17 B-side tracks (all of which were release as part of a soundtrack, a single or from one of the above best collections):The Promise / Paint the sky with stars / Oriel window / Willow on the water / Only if... / 'S fagaim mo bhaile / Midnight blue / Song of the sandman (lullaby) / Isobella / The first of autumn / Morning glory / I may not awaken / Oiche chiun (Silent Night) / Anrion (Love song from LOTR) / May it be (Song from LOTR) / Book of days (Love song from Far & Away) / Only time (Remix)If you wish to have these B-side tracks then i highly suggest hunting from her previous albums rather than buy this nicely done but extremely poorly developed collection."
2,Give it a miss,"This is the 2nd time that Warner Music has released a collection of Enya, first being Box of Dreams and now this.Note that there are truly only few tracks here that were never released under her standard albumn releases: Sun in your stream, Isobella, Song of the sandman, Willows on the water, First of autumn and May it be.There are other Side B tracks that have been omitted, making it a very incomplete collection. If you have collected most of her albums including singles, you probably already have most of these tracks, so give this a miss. Otherwise, by all means get this great collection if you are totally new to her music."
2,Nothing new but ...,"Agree with others. Nothing new, just recycled hits. But I support Enya since first heard her. And I collected possibly everything about Enya. I buy this one as well."
3,I'm all for recycling but....,I love Enya's music. She'll be remebered as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. My gripe is that there's just collections of old stuff and hardly anything new here. As a first Enya collection it's fine but when will we see an all new album with all new material? Has Enya run out of inspiration or has she got composer's cramp? This is the kind of stunt we see every now and then from old rockers when they start to run low on cash.
2,Mine broke,"I was very disappointed with this set for a non-music issue. After paying over $50 for the set, shortly after they arrived two of the disks cracked (one almost in half). I don't bounce my CDs off the walls. My wife considers me to be rather fanatical about handling my books and my DVD/CD media. All I can think is that the material was really cheap or I just happened to get the lemon in the bunch. I will also agree with some of the other comments that there was a good bit of repitition with this album set."
1,Oh The Humanity!!!!!,"Enya is by far the worst musician ever.I think the last thing we need is an Enya box set.All of the ""music"" on this box set is horrible and will have you reaching for that stop button on your CD player in no time.if you enjoy good music,then stay away from this CD at all costs.But if you like terrible music,then the Enya box set is destined for your CD case."
3,Thorough,"This biography was very thorough in the way it captured the mining, nitrate explorations of the Guggenheims. But it lost steam when it focused on more present-day Guggenheims and their work in making Twentieth Century Art especially in America of great importance. It seemed to lack a soul and a family tree chart. If it had a soul, it would have given the reader a chance to feel empathy with a Guggenheim and if it included a chart, it would have helped the reader keep track of each offspring. Overall, it shed light on a family that helped to enrich America."
5,Great Album!!! Has its hard and easy moments.,"The son of great country legend Waylon Jennings has done it again! This is better than previous material. Every song is worthwhile on here. I feel a blend of hard Southern Rock like Lynyrd Skynyrd or Black Crowes, then Country Ballads like his old man. This album is not too Country for people who only listen to rock for sure.If you haven't heard of Shooter Jennings before- buy this album first, you will not be disappointed."
4,Love it,"Love this album, though I would hesitate to call it country it feels more like 70's southern rock, but nothign wrong with that when it is done right."
5,spectacular spiritual successor to outlaw country,"It's an outdated term right? Shooter Jennings begs to disagree and shows us in a hard driving album. The first time I listened, I wasn't too impressed. Then, following a big night, I had to drive about 3 hours hung over as all getout, and popped this one in. I listened to it three times straight through. By the end of the trip my headache was intact, but I had a friend in the car with me and the volume at the proverbial 11.Well done."
5,Electric Rodeo Kicks Ass,"This CD is full of powerful upbeat songs that remind me of Waylon, but still have the original new sound of Shooter. I don't know if this CD is better than the ""Put the O Back in Country"", but it is just as good! Long live Outlaw Country music!"
4,a new country rebel,"Shooter is following in his fathers footstep as a rebel in country music. The cd starts out with a very hard country, foot stomppin song and settles down a bit and becomes a very enjoyable cd to listen to. On a few songs, you would almost think you are listening to Waylon. Shooter and his band have a lot of talent, they just need to find their spot in country music."
1,I want my money back,"Eletric Rodeo= GarbageDo not waste your time buying this CDIf you wanna hear Real Country go and listen to Wayne""The Train""Hancock, Hank III & JB Beverley & The Wayward Drifters!!Shooter is just riding on his daddys coat tail!!"
4,Refreshing,"If you like country music but you think yer gonna puke everytime you have to suffer through a ""country"" song from Nashville these days, and you happen to like classic rock, you would probably appreciate what Shooter's trying to do here. Folks, this is the Real Deal. I don't mean real country or real rock - this is a hybrid - I mean he's making music that is honest and down to earth. A flash in the pan, he's not. He's going to be around for awhile."
3,It's OK...,It will provide the fun but lacks in quality of sound...I have purchased Remo products before and loved them for the price. This one is not as good.
1,Watch out for deceptive advertising,"I ordered this product with the hope that it would work better than other hair removal creams I have used. When I received it, it had a broken bottle and cream was all over my package. I was surprised when I read that the cream needed to be on for 20 minutes. Nair only takes 3. I tried it for 20 minutes and only a few hairs were removed! I was shocked. I then put on Nair and 3 minutes later, the hair was off. I then read the ingredients and found that this overpriced revitol contained the same active ingredients as ""much cheaper"" hair removal products. I was disappointed and wanted to get the full refund as the advertising for revitol has stated. When I read the fine print, I found that there was a 10 dollar charge for each bottle! That is a rediculous return policy. I believe that this company is deceptively advertising a product that does not work any better than store products...in fact it is probably worse!"
1,A total bust!,"This will be a short and sweet review. I tried this product three times starting at 13 minutes, then 18 then 23 and it did not remove a single strand of hair. Other than smelling horrible and slightly irritating my skin I could find no discernable effect. I was using it on my legs. Back to the trusty razor!"
1,Don't expect refund for defective product.,"I purchased a tube of this 2 months ago. Tried it then, and wasn't overly happy with the results. I thought I would give it another try yesterday. It did absolutely nothing. Checking the tube closer, I felt a crackling inside. The contents had separated and crystallized on the inside of the tube. As I squeezed the tube to break up the crystals, a few slivers broke through the tube. I contacted ""The Natural Health Shoppe"" and was told I couldn't return it. I guess this stuff has a shelf life of about a week. So now not only won't I ever purchase another ""Revitol"" product, but ""The Natural Health Shoppe"" will see no more business from me either."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!,"I bought this in hope of not having to wax anymore. I first used it like directed on the bottle and it did nothing at all, not even a single hair was removed. I thought the hair might have just been too thick, so i trimmed the area and tried again. I got the same results the second time, not a single hair was removed. I beleive this product is an expensive scam because it does not work."
3,Expected more!,"This product had received really good reviews, but for me, I am not finding that it works any better that NAIR at 1/5th the cost! Will not purchase again, very disappointed."
1,Hair removal cream purchase,I think I got some old hair removal cream or something because mine will not even come out the container!
1,does not work for me,"not one hair was removed, it burned my skin, and it smelled bad. I don't recommend this product. don't waste you money."
1,Incorrect Ingredients!,"Beware, if you are knowledgeable about toxic ingredients,and you think the ingredients on this listing soundpleasing, visit the revitol website before purchasing,even though on their website, they show an image includingthe ingredients and the print may be hard to read, I definitelycan read ""Sodium Lauryl Sulfate""."
1,Waste of $$$,"I ordered this product, tried it and found that it is complete waste of money. What a disappointment. I'll never buy again or recommend to anyone."
1,Horrible!,"I use much cheaper hair removal creams with better results. When I got my two bottles, I was excited but that was short lived. They had some grainy stuff in there and I'm still not sure if it was just expired or hardening. It barely took out any hair and I had to use shaving sticks (which I was trying to avoid) to remove the hair. I continued to use it anyway and used the whole two tubes with no success. I left it on longer the second time and it worked a little bit but I still needed a second method. I tried it on my hands, on my feet and on my underarm and it just did not work. It is a complete waste of money! Use Veet or Nair instead."
1,Revitol,I am unable to use this product. I tried a test area as the directions called for and I seem to be sensitive to the product. It caused me to feel as though I had been burned and I needed to remove it prior to it removing any hair.
3,l,I am not big on using removal cream but this one seems to be as good as any. I still get the rash that I was hoping to avoid.
1,Save your money,"Was hoping for so much more from this product. I was hugely disappointed with the end result. The end result being absolutely NO hair removal whatsoever. Applied product to one underarm to test. Left product on the maximum allowed time. Wiped product off as described, what was left was exactly what I started with. I truely wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money. Went out and bought Veet at my local CVS. Followed the package directions and wala my hair was removed. It did burn a bit but I did get the end results I was hoping for. Do NOT order Revitol, check your local stores for a much cheaper and more effective product."
3,Revitol,The product was somewhat difficult to wipe off. Directions claim you should use a paper towel and I have resorted to using a towel because it is rougher and will actually rub the cream off.
1,Dont buy from the revitol site,"do not buy from this site.1. they have a no cancel policy. if you mistakenly order something , you cant remove it.2. they add insurance and a ridiculous shipping charge to the order. (8 bucks for one tube)don't know (and now don't care) how well the product works. when the company treats you that way, you go in the other direction."
1,a good TV...,"the picture is really cool, and it seems like there are multiple speakers. that i like. what i don't like is that i paid 150 bucks to get the screen flat. you can get a TV with this great picture for less. i recommend searching a little more before you choose a TV"
3,biased towards UK perspective,"A small book, lots of images in black&white, almost Xerox fashion. The perspective in which was written is undoubtedly from a UK one. For instance there is no mention of the Macchi M 72 that got still has the world piston seaplane velocity record. So it is a nice addition for someone interested in seaplane history (it stops around the 70's), and has some interesting trivia mostly about UK related ones. It is not a comprehensive, world history of seaplanes."
3,It does the job.,"This BB/Pellet trap is good. Its not expensive and it does the job. The only negative(s) I've seen thus far is that you have to tape the target to the trap and also its a little bit of a pain to get the BB's out especialy with the shredded cardboard all mixed in. But hey, nothings perfect. It saves BB's and for a basement shooter like myself there's less cleanup. I'd reccommend it."
4,Just what I was looking for,"Searched the net for a trap I could use for my BB pistol (Co2). This works just fine, I would reccommend it to anyone looking to practice outdoors or in their garage."
3,"Works well, but small",Title says it all. Very small target. Requires bigger backstop. The BB/pellet catch works well. Perfect for son's first BB gun - a Red Ryder.
3,crosman bb/pellet trap,"Not all of the pellets stay in the trap. Some bounce back. Don't know if this is normal or not, as this is our first ""trap."""
2,This game should have stayed in the 80's,"This is not a good game. It is so simple and i was dissapointed to find it had very little of the elements of a good plane shoot-em up. You don't get any bombs, power-up' are limited, no 2-player option, and easy to kill enemies and bosses. I thought the fact that there were 32 levels was good, but you get unlimited continues, password saves, and the levels are easy enough for a monkey to beat. A dissapointing game. Leave it in the past and on the shelves."
5,Almost too easy to be true,"The only problem I have had with Quickbooks Invoice isdiscovering that it was so easy. Having been trained bymany other software packages over the years, I kept lookingfor the installation or usage issues.As long as you know two concepts: (1) What is an invoice(2) What is a payment, then you can easily run and installthis software.More than that, like many other Intuit products, it is alsofun and friendly (and I have never liked bookkeeping!).As an added bonus, a specially great way to take credit cardsand process them in the same steps...Way better than doing it manually or with spreadsheets orword files.Athol Foden - Pres. Brighter Naming"
4,Guitar lessons for a new generation.,"The new instrumental venture from the German virtuoso is a terrific recapitulation of all the elements that made him great and quoted by everybody,from Vai to Satriani.Excellent,powerful tracks,setting a new standard for the genre.The rhytm section is especially impressive,i.e.,Ainsley Dunbar&John Onder."
4,thougths after a few listens,This is a good all musical cd. It isn't as good as the thank you cd which is superb. It does remind me very much of Joe Satriani's work. It isn't real heavy as I thought it might be. It doesn't possess anything like into the arena as far as heavy intrumentals go. It does lag in a couple of places ..I think specifically in the 5th track but the overall quality is very good. I mean it doesn't sound completely like Satriani but it does sort put me in mind of his work but it sounds like micheal schenker. This is the first of two instrumentals he has done it has a thing in there that a new one called micheal schenker 2000 will be put out through ms records on july 1st. It doen't rise to the level of greatness but it is good and at the right price.
1,worst guitarist ever lived,"I dont understand why people like him but personally I hate him . How can you guys sometimes compare him with Satriani .If Satriani was a god playing guitar in Olympus then Schenker would be a slave begging for talent in Athens. Also the one thing I want to add is that his guitar techicians are the worst of all , of course if they do exist!Damn it , never buy it .Why dont you listen to guys like Jason Becker ,Petrucci in Dream Theater ,Marty Friedman maybe ?"
5,ADVENTURES OF THE SOUL,"OH MY!!! What's is this? Schenker's first totally instrumental album is something that will leave you confused and stunned. The whole album is a masterpiece of the electric guitar. Schenker knows how to translate his incredible virtuosity into strong and well crafted rock songs, very different from other guitarrists who only fill the songs with solo after solo in the speed of light. The band here is also strong, jus a three-piece, straigh-forwarded old style formation - guitar, bass and drums. No weird noises, etc. Just Schenker - guitar, John Onder- bass and Aysnley Dunbar - drums, delivering first-class instrumental music. This album is a must, a real winner. Unfortunately, once I live in Brazil I'll probably never watch Michael play live..."
5,The best cool brew tea I've ever had,"This is the best cool brew tea I've ever had. The raspberry and lemon are the best. I've tried others and they don't measure up. I don't normally like the flavored teas, but these are really good. Of course the sweeter the better!"
5,"Light, refreshing and easy!","I love this product because it is ready to enjoy very quickly. It ""brews"" in the refrigerator."
3,Mmm... Hibiscus,"When i bought this product, I was expecting it to taste like Snapple's raspberry iced tea.Well, if you follow the instructions, this stuff does NOT taste like raspberry iced tea. I use 2 bags of tea for about 16 ounces of water, and if it steeps more than about 5 minutes, it rapidly starts tasting much more like hibiscus flowers than raspberries. Note that hibiscus is the #2 ingredient. If you steep for less time, it tastes weak.To counteract this, and get a great batch of raspberry iced tea, add a little lemon juice. I use about 1 tbsp for the 16 ounces of water. This hides the hibiscus flavor and brings just a bit of tartness to make it taste more like wild raspberries.I knocked off 2 stars because it isn't easy for me to store lemon juice at work, and my objective with this tea was to save money and get a healthier drink for my afternoon caffeine fix. It serves the purpose, but it is rather funny tasting without the lemon juice."
5,If you like UNSWEETENED FLAVORED iced tea---this is for you,"I do not like sweet tea...don't want it artificially sweetened nor with sugar. Very difficult to find flavored unsweetened tea that isn't herbal (ugh). But this company that makes primarily herbal teas, does offer this in raspberry and peach and I order boxes and boxes of it at a time...and it is cold brew...I fill a gallon jug with water, put the tea bags in for 10-15 minutes, and voila. Very tasty.Celestial Seasonings Ice Cool Brew Iced Tea, Raspberry, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)"
2,"Return to the Arcade, calling for earlier version Windows 7","I bought this product years ago, but when I try to run this product on Windows 7, it drops. Truly, this game was designed to run on older versions of Windows, but if they can provide us a Windows 7 version it must be appreciated."
4,Great Fun1,"I've really enjoyed playing most of the games in this package. There are just two things which diminish my enjoyment. One is that I have to reset my ""Settings"" mode on my computer to a 256 bit color setting. Otherwise the games don't work properly. The second is that I need to purchase a joystick because I just can't get the Pac Man and Mrs. Pac Man to work with just the arrow direction keys - I'm not too adept with those keys when speed is required. I love Pole Position. Have lots of fun times with that one. I have tried Dig game, but again I think a joystick will make it easier. Good buy. Lots of hours of FUN!"
4,Return of the Arcade: 20th Anniversary Edition with Ms. Pac-man,Games are as advertized - this is a hard to find game - a joystick is needed to obtain the best out of the games..alot of fun.
2,Does not Work with XP,I purchased this without checking the spec to see if it was compatible with Windows XP. This was my fault. The games plays but very slowly.
2,Watch out on Win 98 w/DirectX 8.1,"Even though I have 256 Mb, I have found this one to be quite flaky under Windows 98. It randomly fails to load games properly under DirectX 8.1, which then procede to eat system resources until the system crashes. MS has been unable to resolve the problem (and, the first time, the registration # it gave me was faulty and they wanted me to pay for support, had to re-install and get a new # before I could even get them to acknowledge my existance w/o a credit card...). Even when the games do work, they are generally poor adaptations. For much better emulation, get MAME and download the original game ROMS at www.mame.dk. Sorry for the sour grapes. Expect that those running later versions of Windows or earlier versions of DirectX might be in better shape."
2,insecurity,"the fact that this book was published in 1997 from work done earlier does not excuse its failure to address material dealing with the panoply of imperatives for security either then or now. while the economy and the environment are mentioned as items to be addressed in the new security syllabus no attention is given to cyberterrorism, asymmetrical warfare, catastrophic terrorism, or even biological warfare. the works cited tend to be parochial and, generally, naive. the book does reveal the thinking of some of the people who occasionally advise our government on such matters as security. zut, alors! some of the chapters include syllabi that provide insight into what is, perhaps, being purveyed as secuity studies across the country and, heaven forefend, around the world. the book provides no web addresses."
5,Optex TD10,This item has been in use for 3+ years outside and open to the elements. This device worked very well and I will order another one immediately.
3,AC Power Adapter for Compaq Notebook Presario C500,"Good buy for the price, however weather it is this one or a name brand seems to me that the quality of construction on said device is poor. I need to order a new one alost evey year, but this is cheeper then buying a whole new notebook/ laptop."
5,Life changing!!!,"You will never be the same after reading this book. Everyone I know has enjoyed it from beginning to end. Whether you're married, divorced, single or separated, you will be able relate to the characters in the story. It will make you laugh, cry and leaving you wanting more."
3,"Great, powerful message wrapped in just an okay story...","Author Mimi Jefferson offers a powerful message about adhering to God's plan for the single woman's life. However, it is more sermon or inspirational message than a cohesive novel. The characters, though in situations many of us can relate to, are not well developed. The characters are largely one dimensional and the stories are not well connected. Furthermore, the transition into the experiment is both abrupt and slightly less than realistic. Also the transition between the sermons and third person descriptions and the first-hand dialogue sections are not seamless.This is a good alternative to a non-fiction book on the topic to both challenge and inspire, but probably not the choice for those looking for a pure novel with well-developed characters and a cohesive story line."
5,Single Sister Experiment,This was the best book I've read in a long time. Iam waiting for the next book to come out. Job well done Mimi Jefferson.
1,Nonfunctional,"I have sent this item back to the elusive company that repairs or sends out refurbished stock with you return this CF. On 3 separate times it was returnd, and they seem to have lost the last return- $129.00 down the drain. I prefer my Toshiba 8 gb, as it works flawlessly for at least 48 GB's worth of photos. The Seagate failed every time, after very little use.Definitely not worth the 39.00 they are now selling it for."
5,Storage Hog,No such thing as to much storage space. I'm a storage hog. This is a great addition and much needed item for laptop users. We have 3 computers and this makes syncing a breeze. Great for transferring files from home to work and visa versa. Works well for me.Seagate 8 GB CompactFlash Photo Storage Hard Drive ( ST68022C-RK )
2,"High Capacity, low cost, but slow","Fairly inexpensive when I purchased this for $150 last summer. If I waited until now, for the same price, I could get a CF card in non-hard drive version for the same price which I would suggest over this. The unit is very slow and the hard drive base unit takes alot more power from your machine. I use this with my Dell Axim X50v, and though it works, the battery consumption is very noticable. Also, the speed of the drive is definately not the fastest. Like I said above, for the $150 that I paid summer of 2006, it was a great deal but as all things, prices drop and if I had to do it over, I would skip this and go for flash based unit."
1,I could not be more unhappy,"I have had this item for approximately 90 days. I have used it to take about 500 photos in that time. I just took a handful of photos and removed the card to open them in photoshop, and the card started clicking and clicking and it cannot be recognized in Windows. I put it in another card reader. Same. I changed computers: same. I put it back in the camera (a Nikon D70) and received the CHA error, which means the card isn't functioning.I recommend avoiding this product. It is NOT sturdy enough to trust your images to it. I have three Sandisk CF cards (Two 1GB Ultra II and a 1GB Extreme) that while are smaller in capacity, have never given me a bit of trouble (and they read & write faster as well).I can't believe I lost so many images. I never should have trusted a miniature hard drive to be sturdy. I treated this thing like it was made of gossamer strands and it still died on me.Don't trust it. If I could give it lower than one star I would."
5,Good Stuff,"I've got this on my dell axim x 51v and it works well. Have many medical programs and over 100 books on my pda. I love it! I had no problems with installation...of course you just pop it right in. The dell recognized it right away and have had no problems with it since. My only suggestion is, if you are going to pull the CF storage drive out frequently, then put a small piece of tape on it {don't obstruct the little hole} to use as a pull tab, as the dell axim has no eject button for the CF card. However that has no reflection on the CF drive itself, which works beautifully for me!"
3,A lot of space but slow,"I am not talking about read/write speed from camera to the drive because no direct feeling. But it takes 3-5 seconds to review a image you just shoot (On a Nikon D200) and 2-4 seconds to scroll up/down. So if you review your images often, it will be frustrating sometime. It's ok to connect to a computer through a USB 2.0 card reader, don't feel slow."
2,Firmware issue,"If you plan on using this in your Camera....Do not buy this drive if you don't have all compatible firmware. Check the Seagate website for camera compatability. I have been trying to get my drive replaced with the updated firmware, which is covered under warranty, for the last two weeks from seagate. Seagate's warranty support does not have a process for sending out photodrives with the correct firmware. I would have to say that they are incompotent. and......I am tired of repeating my story everytime I call them. They need a better system in place to special situation like this. They are still working on trying to resolve the issue. They claim that the firmware can not be updated by the end user. This is where the problems lies. They need to enable firmware update through the end user.I would suggest purchasing the Hitachi microdrive instead. It is not worth the hassle to deal with Seagate. I would have gladly pay the same amount for a 4Gb Hitachi instead of an 8gb Seagate."
4,Good for the money. eagate 8 GB CompactFlash Photo Storage Hard Drive ( ST68022C-RK ).,"I use this compact flash drive on my Canon 5D. I timed it against my ATP 40X compact flash and the Seagate is slower. I filled the 5D's buffer and timed how long it took to write all the data. The ATP took about 30 seconds, the Seagate took about 40 seconds. But the price for this can't be beat. Compared to other 8GB drives that cost twice as much (or more), this is really incredible. I haven't owned it long enough to determine reliability, but if the Seagate name holds up, then this deal can't be beat."
4,"Lots of storage, good price, a bit slow","I bought this for my Canon Digital Rebel XT to lower the price point on additional GBs of storage. Works great for that but it's write speed is too slow for burst mode or for taking a number of shots in quick succession. Have had no problem putting it in and taking it out or with bouncing it around in the camera or camera case (not that I use the the camera or equipment as substitute basketballs). For faster shots or shooting a number of pics one right after another (like when the light is changing fast) I stick with the SD card. So - good price, lots of storage but a bit slow on write speed."
2,It's somthing that will quit once you get used to it,"I odered it, it broke, similar to someone elses review, i got the second one (Amazon is a really really nice company) but that also stopped working after using it for a couple of days,... same thing,... it starts making the funny noise, and then just freezes up the computer, or my axim.i asked amazon to replace it this last time, i feel 3's a charm, so hopefully it'll b fine now... i don't know.... will keep you updated...*** but i must admit, its a bang for the buck, u can't beat the price, i just wished it worked right****"
3,Great toy!,"We bought this for our 10 year old for Christmas, he has Robosapien and this was next on his list. After reading reviews on Amazon we decided to get it, and he loves it! We also have a 3 year old, so I was a bit nervous after reading about not letting your young ones use it alone, but it is great. He does so much cool stuff, so many great actions, and is easy to turn it off and shut him down if it gets ""wild"" or your kids have had enough. It has been a huge hit, and we recommend it for any fan of the Discovery Channels ""Robo"" series!"
5,I wish I could give it 100 stars,"Roboreptile is very cool. It changes colors and has 3 different types of roars and it is fun to fight it with other robots. It is very hard to get out of the box, but after you're done with that, it is awesome!"
5,Roboreptile,"My daughter really liked it because it's very realistic, except the eagle scream. You can feed it virtually (and it makes a bone-crunching noise), and it has three modes. And she likes the fact that it can walk around, and chase things. It also goes to sleep when you put the hood on it. It also has a touch sensor, so it responds when you touch it."
5,Been searching for this book forever! Love it!,I LOVE this book! I read it back in the 90's and fell absolutely in love with it. I have been looking for it for years and I finally stumbled across another of her books which led me to this one. Jennifer Horsman is one of my all time favorite authors at this point. She makes me feel so much emotion in this book and all her others. You definitely won't regret reading this book.
2,A bit degrading,"In this book, the female character is constantly abused and manipulated by the male hero, and ""all for her own good"". I was hoping at the end there would be some sort of reckoning for his actions, but, instead, everyone is magically in love and his previous actions don't matter. I'm not sure why so many people have this listed as one of their favorites. I was thoroughly dissatisfied."
2,Not worth the price.,"I bought this based on the reviews and the bodice ripper book list. Some parts were okay but there was too much about how the hero and heroine were feeling. You really have to stretch to believe in the ""magic"" used in this book. I read a lot of HR, especially bodice rippers. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Romantic tale about love and adventure,This book is not what you might expect. It has laughter and joy. Plus the ending is the best in the world.
2,"common knowledge, nothing helpful, go online instead","Since I've been able to do a little writing online and in print, I thought this would be helpful to learn more about the process. This title compiles easily compiled knowledge from your local library or from countless web sites or blogs. Save yourself the money and just print out useful information from a writing website, where the information is more up to date and free.In fact, be cautious in choosing titles that claim to help you write better or market your material better. Many of them are just filled with basic information and are promoted by companies that want you to buy their products, not actually help your career. Their promotional ads push more and more titles, but after awhile they all appear the same. Get one or two resources (Strunk & White's Elements of Style or the Chicago Manual of Style) and then go online for the rest."
2,Do some research on youtube first,"Search on youtube for Fram filters. The video take aparts are not friendly towards Fram at all. My mechanic swears by these, but judging from the videos they are made very cheaply nowadays. Spend a little more and get a good Wix or Napa filter instead, your car will run better for it!"
4,Still Good After All These Years,"These releases are not the greatest of the Scooby Doo franchise; still, this makes them better than most of the entertainment available these days. This set does contain one of my favorite episodes To Switch A Witch. If you are a Scooby connoisseur, pick up this release today!There must be a glitch in Amazon's system somewhere; because, some of the reviews listed here are for What's New Scooby Doo? not Where Are You? including one under Most Helpful Favorable Reviews by H. Summers."
2,I love Scooby-Doo Where Are You but this isn't it.,"I am a big fan of Scooby-Doo as are my children so I usually don't write negative reviews about Scooby but this review is negative because multiple Amazon sources have this series incorrectly labeled as ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You"" (the original Scooby-Doo series from the 60s and 70s) but this is actually ""The Scooby Doo Show"" from 1976-1978.I think it's borderline fraudulent to label this show as ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You"" when that's NOT the series being provided. The animation is different -- there are extra characters like Scooby's politically incorrect cousin ""Scooby-Dum"" and overall The Scooby-Doo Show simply isn't as entertaining as Scooby-Doo Where Are You?Amazon-Doo, Where's my refund?!?"
5,Love Scooby-Doo,"We already had the first two seasons of Scooby-Doo, so it was a natural that we had to have this disc too."
1,Emma's Dad,Product is mastered incorrectly. Side B of second disc is just a repeat of disc one. And even disc one appears to be missing an episode. Fully a third of the episodes on this set are mislabeled and MIA. Not sure how all these positive reviews could have missed this essential fact. Did you guys even watch these DVDs or merely collect them.
3,Incomplete.,"My biggest dissapointment was that this set isn't complete. It contains none of the Scooby Dum episodes (Gator Ghoul, Headless Horseman, Vampire Hotel) and doesn't have the 10,000 volt ghost episode, despite these episodes being shown in the opening credits/song for every episode on the DVD's. I assume that they'll be a season four coming out soon, but I'd have gladly paid more for all the All Star episodes in one collection. Also, the packaging is flimsy and not durable like the packaging for Season 1 & 2 and the Scooby Doo movies collections."
3,"Scooby Doo, Where Are You! - The Complete Third Season...","Okay, you've probably heard this several times over but, essentially, it bears repeating. This is actually the third season of ""The Scooby Doo Show"" which ran from 1976-1978. This is NOT Season 3 of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"". There never was a season 3. However, these episodes were the unofficial third season of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!""(at least, in Hanna-Barbera's minds, anyways) which used the Original Series' 1969 opening intro/title & credits during its' original airing on TV. The box claims these are lost episodes but they are anything but, believe me. To be sure, all this is a might confusing.With that out of the way, for the casual or hardcore fan of ol' Scoob, this is an excellent buy. While I don't care for Scrappy's appearance in the show, it is still classic Scoob.I really loved watching these episodes. You will, too."
4,Great fun...,"Though not as good as season's 1 and 2, the third season of ""Scooby Doo Where Are You"" is still great fun. The lovable dog and his crime fighting friends are back with plenty of gags, outrageous eating and corny monsters. If you loved the original this one will be acceptable if not awesome."
3,"If you LOVE Scooby Doo, Where Are You?...","I might be one of the few dissenting voices here, but if you love the original Scooby Doo, Where Are You? series, this can only disappoint...maybe slightly...maybe intensely. I find the different voices distracting. Velma floats in and out of a nerdy voice and sometimes almost sounds like Daphne. I hate the opening theme AND the appearance of Scooby Dum in the opening credits. These definitely have a cheaper feel to them though for most people less picky than myself, they're probably fine. As mentioned, these are from the mid 70s, not the late 60s/early 70s...the music reflects this as does an AWFUL and distracting laugh track. I think the most responsible review is to say that they're adequate. Lacking any more of the ORIGINAL episodes, they're an ok second. I think it's despicable labelling them as ""Season 3"" as they're more definitely NOT season 3."
2,bad discs,"I got these discs as a christmas gift to my neice and nephew. They love Scooby.Unfortunately, The discs were mastered wrong. The second disc has the same episodes on both sides. Make sure you check these discs out before you give them as a gift."
4,love the scooby!!,"the wonders of childhood comes back to a person who grew up on watching this cartoon. now sharing with my 3 yr old granddaughter, who would rather watch the old scooby than watch the newer version(s). enjoyment for all ages!!"
3,Scooby Doo Where are You -Complete third season,"Not exactly as described in title these are from the mid 70s and called the Scooby Doo Show not Scooby Doo Where are You. Some are great others like they were running out of ideas, the same era as the Dynomutt series."
5,YES!!! They finally put these episodes on dvd,"I was sooo excited when they put these episodes on dvd because i hadn't seen a lot of them before. They are often known as the ""lost episodes"". When I bought this dvd I was soo excited to see what the episodes were like. I wasn't disapointed because the episodes are full of monsters, action and awsome 70's type music. The only thing I don't like is the dumb laugh track that plays when the stupidest things happen like when Scooby steals shaggys food. Other then that these 16 spooky ""lost episodes"" are a delight for adults and kids alike! Scooby Dooby Doo!"
5,More Scooby!!!,There's too much drama going on in this discussion! I don't really care about what year these episodes came out or that there are 9 missing episodes of the New Scooby Doo Movies. I'm just glad there's more Scooby!!!
3,"Season 3, Scooby Doo","I don't recall these episodes as a child, and I still find that these series are missing alot of episodes I remember. The best thing about Season 3 is there is no Scrappy or Scooby Dum."
3,Not all there,I'm sorry to say this was kind of a let down. Because it isn't really all of season three. There is a reason scooby dum is in the opening of it. Because he is apart of season three. So I was sad that they didn't have the episodes with him in it. He is funny with Scooby. I hope that some day they will release the rest of this. I love Scooby Doo and I wish they would leave the originals the way they are suppose to be.
3,"The 3rd season? Like, no way, man!","This is in no way, shape or form the third season of Scooby-Doo Where Are You, which ran only 2 seasons, period, in 1969 and '70, not 1976. The New Scooby-Doo Movies actually came between these two series. It had a different theme song with different titles. Velma doesn't even have the same voice. And Pat Stevens doesn't do as good a job as Mindy Cohn in What's New, Scooby-Doo. How about a little truth in advertising?That said, these episodes are a mixed bag. Some are pretty good, some less good. No Scooby-Dum, Scooby-Dee or Scrappy is a definite plus. But many of the gags are just too silly, and the spooks are so strange they give the impression that the writers ran out of ideas. The art and animation are not generally up to the old Where Are You standards, either.But there are worse DVDs you could watch."
3,"Well, this is sorta cool, but...","This release leaves out my favorite episodes:2.1 ""The Curse of Viking Lake"" September 10, 19772.2 ""Vampire Bats and Scaredy Cats""1 September 17, 19772.3 ""Hang in There, Scooby-Doo"" September 25, 19772.4 ""The Chiller Diller Movie Thriller""1 October 1, 19772.5 ""The Spooky Case of the Grand Prix Race"" October 8, 19772.6 ""The Ozark Witch Switch"" October 15, 19772.7 ""The Creepy Cruise"" 2 October 22, 19772.8 ""The Creepy Heap from the Deep"" 2, 3I wonder why these aren't on DVD?"
5,One happy daughter.,"Bought it for my daughter and of course had to watch right away, and then the next day and then the next and on and on and on and on. One of the episodes said it was on section 2 and was on section 3 but that was the only thing. It was in great shape and I had one extremely happy daughter."
1,Scooby Doo Show,"These episodes are from the Scooby Doo Show, not Scooby Doo, Where are you. This collection is also sadly lacking half of the episodes from this series. When are they going to stop putting out half-a**ed collections for exhorbent prices?"
3,W1FB's QRP Notebook.,"I think the product name is misleading. Out of 174 pages, there are 10 pages on accessories, and 5 pages on antennas and baluns. The rest of the book is all construction of QRP transmitters and receivers. It was not what I expected for a ""notebook""."
3,quite a taking little thing,"I must say that even though the writing was not of the best quality at times, I found the plot interesting and Frederica a sympathetic character. There is something about this series that I like very much. Even though each of the sisters has a flaw (Anabelle can be quite annoying), each is very sympathetic and the reader can readily enter into the lives of the sister. I loved Frederica because I could relate to her shyness and insecurity. I guess all of us wish we could find a wicked duke who could see through to our inner beauty."
2,Not the best....,"2.5 stars. Minerva was the best book in this series. The characters of this book didn't have a realistic feeling to them. Usually It doesn't really bother me when the heroine is 17 years old and the hero is in his thrities, but the way the two were portrayed in this book made the hero come off as positively ancient! It was not believable that the they fell in love in the end."
3,Could of been better but still a nice shooter,"This game was okay. It could of had a better story and it should of been more challenging. It is also short. I beat in a week then got bored with it. Some nice things are that you open new cheats after beating each level. Some of the cheats are awesome like rapid fire mode for your pp7. It has some real nice graphics and the controls are simple. The only thing I don't like is James Bond's face. It has very poor texture. If you're a real bond fan, buy it. If not rent it."
4,One of the greatest video games out there.,"James Bond Agent under fire, is the best game I have ever played on any system. It is a first person game, and each level has different play i.e. the first level is one where you grab guns sneak through hallways to complete your mission. Level two you are driving a car trying to catch the bad guys and need to disable their truck so you can retrieve the stolen formula. You don't get board with the game because the play totally changes from level to level. The four player head to head is a flat out blast. This is a great game for anyone over the age of 13 due to simulated violence and some sexual inuendo."
5,Awsome!,I got this game in April. Now it's June and I'm strugling to beat the 12th level.This game has the kind of guns from the world is not enough;but way better. This is a very good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Awsome but short,"I love James Bond games, espeacily when they have great graphics with the new nintendo system GAMECUBE! This game has great graphics, sound, theme, story, and much more! Although there's always a catch to a great game. This game lacks extra features such as...extra missions, and more unlocking cheats. This game also lacks length. It only took me and my friends 7 days to fully complete this game and I was not pleased. If you do not mind if a game is short and you waste your money on a short enjoyment time, then this 007 AGENT UNDER FIRE is great for you..."
5,Better Than PS2,Bond for Cube is so much better...1 The controls are better2 The graphics3 The gameplayplus in the cube version you play with bots in multiplayer.
5,Better than PS2,"If you've played or seen this game on the PS2, you probably know what to expect. But the Gamecube version will have one major improvement over the PS2 game. It's one thing that has vastly improved the multiplayer experience since it was first made famous with Perfect Dark; bots. Computer controlled opponents. Added specially for the GC."
1,Dissapointed,"I would have to say over all Goldeneye is waaaaaaaay better. This game has good graphics but the plot sucks and so do the guns. The multiplayer mode is terrible and there is no AI bots, and the levels are sooooooooooo tiny. This game over all sucks compared to Goldeneye."
4,James Bond 007 Agent Under Fire,this product came to me as an xbox game which is not so bad however its not compatible with the new Xbox systems and cannot be played. Delivery was really good though.
1,dumb and dumber gone bad,The whole thing was the worst game I have for PS2. The multi maps are too small to do anything in. the single is dull over all DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER RENTING IT!
3,"Good, Too easy","it is a great game but its really easy if you like challenging games, i mean i rented it for 3 days and beat it start to end... too easy"
4,Agent Under Fire,I like this game and is defenatly worth the buy .Ithink the graphics are brilliant and the 4 player mode is great fun with your mates.I definatly recomend it and Nightfire
4,Great Bond Game!,"Okay, So. I've played the first couple levels of the famed ""Goldeneye"" beat ""Agent Under Fire"" and am on level 19 on ""Everything or Nothing."" I will tell you right now, this is not the best bond game. BUT, this is certainly not the worst. This is an excellent FPS, full of excitement and challenging gameplay. The only reason for my 4 star instead of 5, is that Bond isn't recognizable, he's not an icon like Brosnan, or Connery or Moore. He's generic. In fact, if it weren't for the occasional one liner or the great Bond score, it could pass as a another game altogether. In the end, this is an incredible gaming experience, and should not be passed up, but if you want true Bond feel, try Everything or Nothing.Gameplay 5-5Graphics 5-5Sound 5-5Characters 3-5Level Design 5-5Difficulty- ModerateOVERALL: A-"
5,James bond just gets better,James bond agent under fire is a very good first person shooter but seeing that nintendo lost rare to microsoft thier will never be a goldeneye 2 for the gamecube but ea games is still making good james bond titles. Enough about that first of all auf has some impressive graphics and good sound the controls are easy to learn and with the gamecube controller which fits anyones hands will really make the controls a brease. Now talkinig about the game. auf is one really cool game that has awsome 2 player mode. the levels can somtimes gets frustrating but still cool.
2,Really Lame,"Joanna Dark it is not.This game is dull,talks to you as though you are watching Play Skool,and -the most real complaint- it is hard,in a headache inducing way,to focus laser guns etc on the exact spot you need to focus them on.Ridiculous."
4,Great game,"this game is super cool you can drive great cars like bmwz8, bmw75iL,Lotus spirit and one Aston martin.The graphics are cool,the sounds, everything.But,it is too shortin the first day i got to the 5 level and now i finished it only 12 levels well first rent it and then if u liked it BUY IT"
2,Agent Under Fire,"I remember when Goldeneye first came out on Nintendo64. That was an amazing game. It was fun to play over and over again. The multiplayer neared perfection. Agent Under Fire on the other hand is a much less exciting Bond game. Overall the weapons aren't very cool. As other people have mentioned the game is extremely short. While Goldeneye had a great multiplayer, Agent Under Fire's is a disaster. The multiplayer levels are so tiny. It just isn't fun playing in an area so small. The BOTS are a nice addition, but it is not enough to make up for terrible arenas. I don't recommend buying this game because you will only play it once and then throw it in a closet. Absolutely no replay value what so ever. The multiplayer just plain ... I hope that the new Bond game, Nightfire, is much better."
3,Bad And Good Game,"When I played this game on my game cube you walk way to slow. The weapons are cool, the levels are cool, but it would be awesome if you could more a bit faster."
5,Best Graphics. THE GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!,"I put this game at maximum rating. If you have seen the graphics for Goldeneye 007,Tommorow Never Dies, and The World Not Enough. Those three 007 games are the best on N64 and Playstation. If you have seen 007 Agent Under Fire, you say that the other 007 games [stink]. Gamecube has the best graphics for the nwe 007 game. The guns are way better too. You don't know what you're missing if you don't buy this game. Perfect Dark for N64 was an great game but dinky to 007 Agent Under Fire. the game invovles a book and a movie. You must buy this game before they run out. The game is going to be a title of game history."
4,"Great!, but its so easy!","007:Agent Under Fire is one of the coolest games because the story-line is great, the characters are pretty cool,note:(if you want Pierce Brosnan to appear, i'd stick with Nightfire),the graphics are extra ordinary and the guns are awesome, like the usually one-shot kill Frinesi shotgun. The only thing that really puts most players down is the shortness of the game, there are only 12 extremely short levels!Overall this game is pretty cool so if you like short games or you are a James Bond fan i'd buy it."
3,Abit Fun and exciting,"This is a okay game. Abit fun.Graphics: 4/5 decent graphics, bullets, explosions, scenery etc.Not too detailed but fine.Gameplay: 3/5 Okay. guns are quite cool. The AI can be kinda stupid sometimes.Value 4/5Difficulty: 2/5 Very easy game. Very short also.Sound 3/5 pretty well done. Ear blasting.Overall: 3.5James bond freak: buy itFPs fan: Don't waste ur money.Not the best FPS game out there, but good enough. If ur looking for a better FPS, get Timesplitters 2, James Bond: Nightfire, Metroid Prime (the best FPS), or Halo."
3,uumm... what?,"This game never had the feel of a bond game. I walked around and did the simple tasks it gives you and it was over. Even if this was just a random shooter I wouldn't like it, but since it's elegidly a bond game that makes it worse. What about the new kids who are into games who never have even experienced a good bond game? they are being left out of something very cool and so am I. Its pisses me off. EA makes a great madden game, but truely sucks at bond. when they bought the rights to the bond games those games were doomed. What are they thinking? The driving levels in this are short and sorry. sure their nice for a little change, but at least make them enjoyable. no skill+no length+no depth=no fun. Boooo! this game goes to the trash."
4,Agent Under Fire,"When I heard that a 007 game was coming out I had to get it.I was surprised that the graphics were great. I would give the graphics a 10/10 rating.The parts that weren't that great were the controls,the amount of levels.The controls would be very confusing to a beginer playing the game.But I have played it on gamecube a couple of times before I bought it so I knew the controls already.So for the controls I gave it a 6/10 beacuse it would be very confusing for a beginer.The other bad thing about it was the amount of levels.when I got it only took me about 6/7 hours to beat it because there only 12 levels. If you were a beginer it would probly only take you a week to beat the game.Because of this for the amount of levels I would give it a 7/10.If you want a game you can beat fast you should by 007 Agent Under Fire."
5,Great Game!!,"This game for gamecube is an amazing game. Not only multiplayer is the game absolutely amazing but so is the single mission. I thought goldeneye could never be out done, but this game has just done it. NO game comes close to this one!!"
4,Best So Far,"If you are craving first person shooting games for the new systems out there, this is definitely the best one. It has easy controls (unlike all of the PS2 games) and its has a good multiplayer. The single player could use a little work though, there could be more levels and action.Overall, this is the best shooter game that you're gonna get if you don't want to play GoldenEye for N64. I say that they make the next game with the same format as Goldeneye, just changing the levels (Ex. Same way of getting cheats, new characters, etc.)"
3,could have been better,"This game, I can't say was the best.The graphics are good, but the gameplay is not at all.I beat the entire game in two days flat,and the worst part about it is that your enemies can see you when you try to sneak around them! So you can't try to beat your level by sneaking past your enemies-THEY HAVE EYES IN BACK OF THEIR HEADS!!!!!If you like SEEEEERIOUSLY EASY games, then buy this game."
2,A decent game,"i rented this game and its alright. The controls [stinks] and the missions aren't what u call inovative this game is okay, but goldeneye is better. Anyone who thinks other wise is a gamecube fanboy or never played goldeneye2"
4,GCube's best game...until Nightfire,"This was my first 007 game. It's great, and just challenging enough so you can beat it and have a hard, fun time. The missing star? Two player. The levels are tiny and there aren't enough options. Nightfire hits on two-player. The one player action is unbeatable, and great graphics to boot. Great job creating a new plot and not basing it on the movie."
2,"its fun, but weak","Possibly my least favorite bond game, even rogue agent is better. i don't like bonds appearance, the guns, the people, the only good things about it are multiplayer."
3,Good Multiplayer Game,"This is an excellent James Bond game for multiplayer mode. Unlike what other people said, the maps in multiplayer are not that tiny and they can feature AI bots if you turn them on. But this game SUCKS for single player. The graphics are extremely bad and the guns suck. You can't even tell who is supposed to be James Bond!!!! It looks like Pierce Brosnan but it sounds like Roger Moore or something. The plot is also very weak. Another bad thing is that this game says it has the golden gun and all it is is just a pistol painted gold! The game is in 2nd person shooter which also SUCKS. I only recommend this game if you intend it for multiplayer use with 2+ friends. The last bad thing is that after your enemys die they just dissapear which is stupid. But it is what it is."
4,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"single player= Amazining Single player. 12 missions, but it feels like there is more. The missions combine being on foot, in a car, and even in a tank!!!!!multiplayer= Multiplayer is also amazing. You can Q-claw (grapple) anywhere. The bots can be easy medium and hard. There is a lot of different games from just plain shooting to defusing bombs. The maps are gig and amazing. Plus, the mini-map is easy to read and VERY, VERY, helpful.weapons= The weapons sets is amazing. There are grenade and rocket launchers. Plus sniper rifles, grenades, pistols, photon cannons, and machine guns.Controls= The controls are annoying sometimes, but you get used to it. The only thing different from most shooting games, is the looking around controls (control stick and c-stick)."
5,the best,this game is so fun. especialy multi player. the graphics are good and the game play is fun. ive had this game for about a year and im still playing it constantly.so BUY IT!!!!!!!!
3,An OK game,"This is a pretty good game overall. The multiplayer is fun to play with your friends. The single player has a pretty weak structure, although it is for the most part, fun. If you put bots in the multiplayer when you are playing, things can get pretty weird sometimes, like they just appeat out of nowhere sometimes. However, that does not happen too often. And this game is good to keep because you really never get tired of playing it. Overall it a good game."
1,"Run, don't walk to the nearest Mr. Coffee","Initially, I loved everything about this coffee maker. The removable reservoir is what sold me. However, it only lasted about 6 months. It malfunctioned to the point where we felt it was unsafe to use ----it overheated so badly, the handle to the reservoir bent out of shape! The plastic water inlet hole to the pump melted, so the reservoir would not sit properly. These malfunctions caused nasty, burnt coffee, as well as a significant fire hazard."
4,Good coffeemaker for home and office,"A good basic coffeemaker this isn't. It is a great coffeemaker with features that should make it cost much more. The water and filter baskets are removable which makes for easy set up and clean up. The clock and auto setting are great! We can actually have coffee at work when we arrive! What a plus(If I can only get someone to make sure its setup the day before)I recommend this and considering the low price-you can't beat the price-and the convenience of the features, it can't be matched by anything on the market."
1,Plastic-flavored coffeemaker now lives in my attic.,"My wife purchased this coffeemaker when my eight year old Mr Coffee broke.Since the first brew I could taste plastic flavored coffee. I used it for several months hoping the plastic flavor would go away. I tried cleaning it by brewing a coffeemaker cleaning solution several times, and even tried a vinegar home-remedy recipe -- but nothing worked.So now it lives in my attic."
2,"Chewy coffee, anyone?","With our old Mr. Coffee, we regularly had problems with the basket overflowing and sending grounds into the caraf if we brewed more than 4 cups' worth. So we bought this one, and lo! We have the same problem. We can't be unlucky enough to get two coffee makers with the same problem, so we decided it must be the metal filter we use. But the same thing happens with paper filters (though less often--they're taller). So we blamed it on the size of the coffee grounds; maybe the finer grounds from our specially ground coffee clogged the filter. No, same thing happens with Folgers. We have to use perculator-size grounds to prevent the problem. That can't be right.Reading other reviews for the Hamilton Beach product, I see at least one other person has had similar problems. Perhaps it's the coffee maker, after all."
1,Leaks Water From the Bottom,After being advised against this product by other customer reviews and my wife ... I purchased this anyway because it was well priced... well it leaked on me during my first use-- water was all over the counter so I returned it!
4,This CD is both funny and fun.,"The Lawn Jockeys did a great job in mixing up the type of songs they sing. Some of the dialogues as intros to the songs are really funny, especially ""Contruction"" Criticism and No Problem. Perfect Driver is my favorite song of the moment. It really makes you want to see these guys do a live performance. Overall, this CD is both fun and funny. It's great entertainment."
2,can't judge a book by its cover,"an interesting book, to be sure: well researched and adequately written. BUT: Don't think from the title you're going to learn more about how to use the ""memory palace"" technique. Not gonna happen. The book is technical, almost bio-medical, in its treatment of memory. Interesting, as I said...but not if your goal is to learn a little about how memory works and a lot more about how to improve YOUR memory."
5,"""Fascinating"" -- Nature ... ""Rich and Lucid"" -- James Gleick","""One of the last great mysteries is the one we carry inside our heads: how we remember, what we remember, why we remember. ""In the Palaces of Memory"" is a rich and lucid guide to this entangled and enchanting domain."" -- James Gleick""Johnson has written a fascinating book, which perhaps throws as much light on how science is done and on the scientists who do it as any book since ""The Double Helix"" -- Stuart Sutherland, Nature""Johnson has achieved a rare blend of scientific and literary sophistication. Faithful to its complexities and controversies, the book is a fully dimensional portrait, a hologram of the field."" -- Richard Mark Friedhoff, USA Today"
1,more American propaganda,"This documentary tries too hard to make north korea and its leaders look like they are pure evil, while glorifying South Korea, i would not be surprised if national geographic received a ""bonus"" from the government for making this film.It's clear that the only intent of this movie is to create and promote hate against North Korea.if you want to get brainwashed with some American propaganda then watch this."
5,North Korea,This is a great video for a look into the closed North Korean life. Used it for my history class and they loved it. Couldn't stop talking about it.
5,This will scare the heck out of you!,This video is a very rare insight of what is going on inside North Korea! I made sure all of my co-workers saw this video when I was finished with it!
5,Fascinating Look at North Korea,"I first saw this show on television and while discussing it with someone else, I decided to purchase it. The film is based on an eye surgeon going on a humanitarian mission to North Korea to perform cataract surgery. Interwoven with the story is a fair amount of background on the country and its history with a focus on the near religious devotion ordinary people have toward Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. This is especially true at the end when patients having regained their sight after being blind thank not the surgeon, but the Kims."
5,Wow,you have to believe me no other speaker comes close after hearing these i had to purchase the same brand 15
4,"Higher End Sound, Medium Price","I hooked these up to an older Sony head unit in my quarter century old Toyota 4runner. Even without an external amplifier they sound good even at higher volumes. I listen to a wide variety of eclectic music as well as talk radio and the speakers handled it all just fine. I am not crazy about the high profile grill because they are a bit of a thief magnet, particularly with the top off the 4runner. Thankfully nothing has happened yet. Recommended."
4,Good in certain instances,These speakers are good if you are replacing stock speakers and not adding any amplification other than the stock stereo.They actually offer really good bass in this scenario.
5,for Lexus SC430,"I replaced the original OEM Mark Levinson speakers in the front doors of my Lexus SC430. The magnets on these is about 4 times the size of the OEMs and the bass response is palpable. ;) The 430 is a convertible (folding hardtop) and when the top is down, you really need to crank the system when driving down the road... these are clear and clean with no rattling or fuzzing. Recommended."
4,Lake and Lyndales,"I thought I already did this.... Anyway, it looks like I'm the first real fan to right a review of this cd (now over a year old). I first bumped into you guys about 6 months ago while surfing around mp3.com for local music. Finally found the cd at Cheapo. It is now stuck in my car cd player and it's all I listen to when I'm on the road. Love it. Now I'm waiting and waiting to see you live.... before the world ends!"
2,Would Not Buy This Product,"This item looks better that it is. It is not durable at all. If you touch it, it will fall apart. None of my kids could play with it because if they did the entire thing would fall over and fall apart. This item was so expensive and I cannot believe I actually paid money for it. It was so big and took up so much room. It was way more trouble than it was worth. I would definetely not recommend this to anyone."
4,This book helped,"Some of the problems in Stewart can be very difficult. This book helped me get through the class, but that was a couple years ago. I understand that now Wolfram-Alpha (online) will provide the same assistance for free."
2,Solutions manual,"Do not bother to order this book!! When I ordered this book for my children, I believed it to have the entire answers to both even and odd numbered problems. It has exactly the same thing as their text books. It was a waste of money purchasing this book."
3,Good enough,Good enough explanations but not worth to buy. You would get more by asking classmates and proffesors. Just stay tuned in class.
1,"This is a turkey, but it's the only one out there.","This is a lousy solutions manual. It frequently skips steps and gives you no indication that it did - you're left saying ""Where the heck (or something more colorful) did that come from?"" After lots of beating your brains out, you might be able to figure it out if you're good at this or if you have a great teacher. If not, don't expect this manual to be a good learning tool - it isn't. You can use it to check the answers on homework, but that's almost all. And since the answers are in the back of the book, why bother? And the Teacher's Manual isn't any better, just more of it. Of course, the book's no prize, either. You might want to sign up for a math section that uses a different book!If you know you're going to need help, save the $40 for this book and pay a tutor instead."
1,Misleading Book Title,"The book I purchased was a solution manual for my calculus textbook, however, the book itself and the product description were not very clear. It appeared to be the correct solutions manual but I have come to find out (Many weeks later) that it was only correct for the first 2 chapters of my math book. Frustrated and short on money, like most college students, I feel that I have little recourse. Is anyone able to help me?"
1,Corner Cracked & Flaking At Delivery,"So I got all excited about this aluminum briefcase for notebooks, right? And I'm cheap, so I didn't want to spend a lot.I open up the box - it says made in China. No biggie, I think. I get the case out...and hear a ""tick"" of something falling to the floor. What fell to the floor? A piece of plastic, broken off of the case.The corners of this ""aluminum"" case are plastic. Not a little bit of the corner. The entire 4 corners are cheap plastic coated with reflective tape to give the appearance of stainless steel.My laptop fit fine in the case.However I'm not toting around an already-broken briefcase I received in the mail. I'm returning this.Avoid."
4,Nice for the Price,This case is a nice option for computers. There is an organizer in the top portion and a nylon security strap and a moveable velcro bar to stabilize the laptop in the case. I think it will suit my purposes well.kmgerard
3,Best buy for the price,"I was looking for something to handle my day to day activities and be able to hold my MacBook, but I did not want to spend a fortune. I took a chance and am glad I did. It has been in use since December and is holding up great. There is plenty of room for folders, papers, pens, flash drives, notebooks and my laptop. It looks sleek and professional looking. I would highly recommend this briefcase.Update - this clip broke after a month."
2,Frustrating as heck,"Can't set the combo. It opens no matter what numers are set. I've already wasted an hour on it. The instructions are three sentences long. Help!!Fri 10/21 - called the company tonight. I did like that they take calls til midnight though the help line is not available on the weekends. After one dropped call and a long on hold, I talked to someone who spent several mins taking all the product info from me and my home and cell numbers. But then instead of addressing the problem, she told me someone would call me back who knew the product.Sat 10/22 - no return call from the company. Needed a locking briefcase today so bought a (soft sided) solo brand one at Staples for 26.95$Mon 10/24 - got a nice phone voice mail and email stating to return the product in the original packaging for a refund. I hope this company is planning to refund the shipping to and from me as well as the 39.99$ price of the aluminum briefcase. I'm increasing the stars from one to two."
2,Case in point,I found the latches to be flimsy and temperamental I had trouble opening the case and I returned it
3,Not the edition I was looking for.,"I had read a ""For Dummies"" book about HTML from my local library, and wanted to buy the book, but it turns out not to be what I had originally read from the library. I must have made a mistake in the title. I don't know if it will be useful to me..."
4,Great for beginners...,I was taking a beginner class and this book provided me with a great reference. The examples and tips are great in this book and I will definitely continue to use this book for ongoing reference.
1,HTML For Dummies,"The book came with a broken CD. I was very disappointed, to say the least, because the CD is an important part of not having to type all the tedious characters of html. What else can I say? I ended up purchasing the same book from someone else."
1,Html for dummies,This book leaves out the basics of how to use the code. It uses code with no explanation. The explanations add no value. The index is incomplete in most cases. It was very poorly done. I am not a dummy. I was looking for a book that explained how to write html pages and use the language. This book dwells too much on how to write a pretty web page. It leaves out how to use the html code. It has no value for me. Don't buy this book.. You will be sorry and won't learn anything from it.
4,I am comfortable with HTML in just 2 days... God is good...,"I had no experience with HTML and purchased the book before I had reviewed any of the user comments. One user in particular had me concerned after my purchase but I decided to investigate for myself. I am very happy with my purchase. I am in the computer industry as an application developer and I felt that I was about to become extinct. Thanks for writing 'HTML for Dummies', a book that I has quickly placed me back in the race. As I read further, should I have any more comments, I will provide them. I am just heading into Chapter 5. Thanks again... Patricia"
1,Too verbose and not a good reference.,"The book wastes too many pages on how toconvey information, e.g., use headers thatlead the reader, use concise language,organize paragraphs in logical sequence.Excuse me, but I thought I am suppose tolearn about HTML, not high school English.Also, the book doesn't describe key HTML areasvery well: tables, colors of background and selectabletext, inserting your own background image.The structure of the book is not obvious soit is hard to use if you need to quickly lookup the syntax for an HTML tag. I have purchasedanother book to act as a reference. As matterof fact, I found many other books in the marketthat are much better at explaning HTML."
5,HTML Newbie,Really great book for a newbie. Helped out a lot and recommend it for beginners. Gives a very good overall intro to html and has helped me out immensely.
2,So you want an SUPERIOR beginner's HTML book ?,"I was given this book as a gift and promptly returned it. To but it bluntly, this book is subpar with respect to its competition. In its place I purchased Elizabeth Castro's ""HTML For The World Wide Web 4"". Castro's book is an excellent reference and a great value. Then I came across Joe Burns' ""HTML Goodies"" and my search ended for a SUPERIOR beginner's book on HTML. Burn's book is a peerless product in terms of content, presentation, value and his uncanny ability to clearly communicate. Don't be fooled by that slick yellow/black cover. Seek out Burns' and Castro's books and at $35.00 for the PAIR you'll be happy, hapy, happy."
1,A Ripoff of Dummies,"This was my first ""Dummies"" book, so perhaps I did not know what to expect. I was expecting a ""how-to"" book with lots of worked examples. This was not it. (BTW: My 12-yr old daughter put this down even faster than I did! She wanted to know how to create webpages. This did not do it for her.)The first 4-5 chapters were boring essays on the history of the web and html. At 90 pages in length, Chapter 6 is apparently the heart of the book. This chapter is basically a HTML manual. It describes all HTML commands using a variant of BNF. Very few examples are given. There is a CD that comes with the book that supposedly contains worked examples. The few that I looked up were not detailed enough for me to infer the patterns.Chapters 7-22 were short overly general sections discussing various issues. I did like chapter 15 on navigation aids. The end material on evaluating the usability of your website was even more vague (and a lot less entertaining) than a Jakob Nielsen lecture."
1,HTML for Dummies NOT for Dummies,"I ordered this book along with Web Design for Dummies expecting to get started writing simple web pages. These books are not for dummies. It offers very little explanation of html tags; it doesn't offer pros or cons of the tag usage vs. another tag; examples are not near the explanation-you need to open the cd to view the eample in question. It spent too much time promoting tools and services outside of the ""Dummy"" concept.I was very disappointed with this book...I bought another book which out-performed the Dummy series."
1,the worst game of the year,"I bought mechwarrior4 and started playing the training phase and that's where I realized the mistake of buying this game.If you use a SideWinder joystick you'll find that the throttle does not work as it did in the previous mech games,and there is little you can customize even when you get a clan mech,what's the deal?As you progress into the game you find yourself going against 4-5 mechs with two dunerheads for lancemates that might shoot you as well as the enemy. Fire control is pretty much a loss,and the targeting almost as bad,if I could talk to the makers of this I would ask them what they where thinking,it is really to bad that the games came to this end I have all the mechwarrior game and this one is the worst."
2,"Ok games, but poor features","Overall this game is OK, but don't listen to the Microsoft ads. The story line is good, the action is decent, but the game just dosen't live up to previous Mechwarrior games. The mech lab is horrible. The player can only exchange weapons of the same type(lasers to lasers, or missles to missles, but you can not replace an AC2 with a PPC, for example), so customization is frustrating and difficult. The acting is poor, and the opening scene is boring and uninspired. The mech selection is also poor, although the new mechs are ok."
1,Not what I expected,"This game is a complete disappointment from the other Mech games. The new mechlab takes away a players creativeness by restricting the weapons a mech can carry. The controls are completely hideous. The only thing about this game that catches my eye is the graphics.If you are a returning Mechwarrior, looking for another great game, then I don't recommend this one. Microsoft has taken a great line of games and completely screwed it up."
2,Mechwarrior made easy,"To me it seems more time was spent on the storyline/video recording than game development. The actors didn't say anything I really wanted to hear and it just wasn't as satisfying blowing things up as it was in MW3. Even with a good PC (Pent 4 1.4G w/all the trimmings) it gets choppy in battle. I recommend if want to pretend you are a blond hair blue eyed kid and you want to see video's of people ""talking"", but if you wanna rip a mechs leg off with an Auto Cannon, stick to MW3."
4,Best PC game in Battletech system,"This game is great! It was released a few years ago but they have never written another game for this IP. I can't understand why. Microsoft got the Battletech (or Mechwarrior) license whey the aquired Wizards of the Coast. It has a loyal fanbase and lots of people still play the game even though it is a few years old and the graphics are a bit dated. Don't get me wrong, the graphics were stellar for their time and they are still pretty good, but compared to the newest games on the market today you can definately tell it is an older game.However, this shouldn't stop you from getting a copy as this is a unique and enjoyable first or third person view shooter style game. The large number of 'Mechs available keeps the game from getting stale and the almost endless combination of weapons loadouts ensure that no two 'Mechs on the battlefield are exactly alike. If you buy this game you should also buy the 'Mech packs and the expansion packs. Definately worth it."
2,the good and the bad,"i have owned ever version since mechwarrior 2, and owned the RPG for the last 15 years. and this one is by far the worst overall. that's not to say that it isn't a little fun to play, but it's not as engrossing as that 2 & 3 were. for every thing they fixed from the last version, they broke something. if you like the complexity of the previous versions, this is not the game for you. AMS doesn't work, you can't shoot legs off, and mech modification is totally unrealistic.but if you are a novice and just want a little bit of sim action, this is the game for you. simple, easy to understand, you'll like that fact that you don't have to work.i wish they woul have just fixed the problems with the 3rd version. it was much cooler."
2,A less than average game.,"This game really isn't worth your time. Microsoft has gutted it. Many people may be raving about the graphics, and the story line; but honestly, the story line isn't any better than mech 3's, and what's the point of great graphics if the gameplay is horrible? Microsoft has done three things that have really destroyed this game. The most noticeable is that the mech handling has been greatly speed up. The speed at which you can turn around in this is something I would expect from a 150 pound person--not a 100 ton mech! Microsoft has also made the control system incomprehensible. The first 3 mech games were simple enough, but this one is impossible to figure out. Finally, the mech lab makes it impoosible to have any variety. The game gives you only one or two options for what you can do to your mech. This igame is not worth it--buy mech 3."
2,Where did all the features go?,"Truthfully, I'd rather play Mech 2 than this one. No external views, no screenshot or movie/mission replay feature, HUD display is different than previous Mech games, and music just seemed bereft of imagination. And I have to use the spacebar quite often just to skip the horribly 'campy' dialog and transitions. I mean, there must be too many bad writers for TV that are out of work because of all these even more stupid reality shows - they end up writing this campy dialog for software games just to eat. Graphics and gameplay alone are very good, but I was disappointed to find it is missing a lot of the features that Mech 2 has - and Mech 2 is more than 8 years old..."
3,Pretty Good,"I've played Mech Warrior 2,3 and now 4. And I would have to say of all of them Mech Warrior 3 was over all the best. In Mech 4 my biggest complaint is that the mech's movement is not all together realistic. They move to fast. In Mech 3 they seemed much more realistic in their movement. They were the lumbering giants that they were supposed to be, not running around like little toys. The missile firings and weapons firing are better in Mech 3 as well, more realistic. I do like Mech 4's Mech Lab as it makes weapons loading more realistic to each mech. I still do enjoy Mech 4 though ,and it is fun to play, but it seems to me that with some small improvements in certain areas, they should have stuck to a good thing with Mech Warrior 3 and just made some more senarios like Pirates Moon."
2,Microsoft kills yet another good game,"Don't even bother. MS seemed more interested in cutsey videos than improving the game. Earlier versions were good because they could be played effectively with a keyboard. Now it seems you need a MS force feedback joystick just to tromp around. What happened to the MLB's? This game elicits no emotions. I had trouble getting away from the MW3, but MW4 is already in the back of the drawer after two weeks. TOO Bad."
1,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Mechwarrior 3, but I am disappointed with Mechwarrior 4. The Mech lab seems more restricting, the mechs are harder to control, and it's difficult to tell how or what you're doing. I keep finding myself going back to Mech3 and leaving Mech4 on the shelf."
3,"good game, bad balancing","Like all mechwarrior games, this one has too many controls to memorize. Aside from that, the graphics are stunning (the exception being the badly acted movies) the mechs are badass and the overall game pretty good. Unfortunately, most of the enemies in this game seem to require ungodly amounts of damage to take down making it nearly impossible to take on more than two or three enemy mechs before your own chassis is a smoldering ruin. I miss the good old days when a single alpha strike from a 100 ton atlas pretty much busted up anything that moved."
5,Mech Warrior 4: Pros & Cons,"Mech Warrior 4 is a real improvement over Mech Warrior 3, with better special effects, a new Mechlab, and easy handling, especially with the Microsoft Sidewinder Joystick, which I have. Firing different weapon groups is useful for volleys, and firing certain weapons together, eg. a Med. Laser and a Sm. Laser together. The new mechs in it(there are 7,) really add to the game. Now you need new strategies to help you defeat never-before seen mechs.Unfortunately, it needs a LOT of space on your hard drive. I think that you could load about 3 other games instead of installing it.If you liked The previous Mech games, you will definitely like this."
5,They Will Be Hard Pressed To Top This Title,"Having played all the Mechwarrior titles and am a loyal follower of the Battletech universe, Mechwarrior 4 is a welcome addition. This title draws you in and gives you the feel of actually driving one of these awsome Mechs. Finally using jump jets is not as simple as pressing a key on your keyboard, and you now have to watch were you step or risk falling. All these new elements add welcome traits to the game. New Mechs, great graphics, and a well devloped story line makes this my favorite title yet. This is a must have for all Mechwarrior fans, both green and elite fans of the Mechwarrior games walk away happy. Pluse the mulit-player action is great. See you on the battlefield."
5,"Ideal for writers, editors, filmmakers and movie-goers","How to Make Your Own Movie is by far one of the best purchases I've made. As an aspiring screenwriter and avid movie-goer, this program taught me more about filmmaking than the last 3 books I've read, combined. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in any aspect of filmmaking.The How to Make Your Movie contains all of the elements of a real film school, complete with guide. You actually get to create a short film complete with sound mixing and editing.It is easy to use, entertaining and very interactive. It covers the important stuff - locations, script breakdowns, terminology of storyboards, lighting, camera equipment, scheduling, and budgeting."
4,Bushness Xtra-Wide,"Excellent for watching sporting events. Magnification is sufficient, but the wide view just the thing for this."
3,Huge,"The optics are great but these binoculars are very large. As a result, they sre apptopriate for sporting events but not for theater shows."
4,"Not perfect, but THE BEST","Not being able to pay mega-bucks to sit in the good seats, I bought these for watching college basketball and hockey from the second level of the Kohl Center, Madison, WI. (On Wisconsin! Go Bucky!) I loved them immediately and still do after years of use. Not being completely happy with the focus / clarity in most areas of the (very wide, almost perfect) field of view, I've looked for years for something better; I've found nothing better at any price. There just isn't anything!Having said that, I continue to look for something better, especially as I age and my eyesight changes. I'm thinking now that a nice and practical alternative MIGHT be the Nikon 5x15 HG Monocular, which does cost a little more but is a higher quality product all around, albeit for one eye only! (I do not see this product currently offered through Amazon.com, unfortunately. Get with it guys!)"
5,STADIUM USE,This product works great for stadium viewing of all types of events. I especially wanted it to view football games and the field of vision is so wide it allows me to see everything from sideline to sideline. The only way this product could be better is if they could make a higher power magnification with the same field of vision.
2,4x22mm,"These are not 30mm x 4 times binoculars.There are 30 mm ""window panes"" (nothing optical)in front of the REAL 22mm objectives.These are truly (in reality) 22x4 binoculars with a 5.5mm (measured) exit pupil.The package documentation comes in English, French, Spanish and German.Only the German documentation says ""22x4"" all the others say ""30x4""...my guess is that the German laws are stricter than US, French, Latin countries.These are not unresonable binoculars but they are extremely expensive at THIS price.Save your time and money.I suggest the 6x30mm Leupold BX-1 binoculars...A REAL (30mm x 6 times) with 5mm (measured) exit pupil. I bought them both....I recommend the Leupold...I can not recommend the Bushnell."
2,New to payroll,"If your new to payroll give in and buy it. I bought the standard payroll and it was much easier than doing payroll manually, especially since I'm still trying to figure what I'm doing. But like all the other Quickbook products, no support and every other page is a way for you to spend more money. Does not support Workman's comp , not even a place to build your tracking and if you void a check it screws up the YTD and it won't let you delete a check. I have to call and pay to find out what's wrong."
5,This trampoline is perfect for young kids,"We bought this trampoline for our kids ages 6, 4, and 1. The size is just perfect for them. It's big enough for 2 kids to jump at the same time, but small enough so that 3 won't fit (so as to avoid injuries). The height is low enough that my 1 1/2 year old can get on and off by himself.This is a great starter tramp for our family - perhaps in a few years we'll get the big one.The trampoline was delivered quickly and was easy to set up. I like that the trampoline has bands instead of springs."
4,Great Beginner Trampoline,"Our 5-year-old loves this trampoline - it's perfect for young kids, as it's low to the ground (doesn't need an enclosure, really), has just enough jumping room, and doesn't take up a ton of yard space. In fact, it can be moved easily for mowing, etc. We'll move up to a larger trampoline in a year or two, but this was well worth it for a ""starter"" version."
2,Fun until you have to buy a replacement mat for too much money,The trampoline is fun for the little kids. It is low to the ground and reasonably safe even without the enclosure. We have owned ours for 5 years and the second mat is sagging like a...The biggest problem with this elastic mat is that you need to replace it every two-three years. You pay out the wazoo ($79) for the mat and then $12-$15 for the shipping. I am not sure if I tried to order a new mat that they still make this model. It appears they may have gone to a spring 8' tramp. Look for better quality.
3,Is it my tampoline or is it just THIS trampoline?,"I bought this exact one maybe a year ago. About 2 months later it just collapses. Set up is not the onlt thing that is hard, actully trying to get a high jump is VERY difficult. This is a little kids toy but most little kids don't just like baby bounces do they? I would not recommend this trampoline to ANYBODY!"
1,Birthday Present,"I got my trampoline for my 12th birthday and I was really excited. Though, as soon as I jumped on it, it wasn't bouncy at all! I am not very happy with this trampoline, and i don't reccomend that you buy it!"
1,Defective AC Charger,"The AC charger did not work, right out of the box. The auto charger was fine, so far. So, for the price, I guess it's a wash."
4,Okay but WHITE!,"Ya they don't come with cables, but if you made that mistake then thats your fault. They work perfect. I use both often the only problem is I received them in white not black."
1,"One sided, this book lacks any depth","This booklet is a rehash of the basic evangelical/fundamentalist position on reincarnation. It gives a once-over-lightly on the basic issues, but Mr. Morey lacks depth in his understanding of reincarnation, which is evident from the first. He presents only the standard ""party line"" with respect to a scriptural understanding, and does not take any in-depth look at the serious questions of textual criticism , nor the historical disagreements which antedate the fourth century AD, all of which are serious issues in this matter. If you wish a quick, one-sided look at the issue, this will be helpful. If you want a look at the issue from all sides, don't waste your time."
2,Deluxe better check again!,The red velvet stains the white plush.The seller charges for expedite delivery and ships it 3 days after when it says it is already in stock.It should be price half the price for the quality you receive
5,The Snow Blind Moon,"I have read The Snow Blind Moon, cover to cover, three times now. I have loaned and given the book to many people who all agreed that it was superior. The characters are welldeveloped and real. The story of white settler and Indian has never been presented with more understanding and sympathy. Why the movies have not discovered it is hard to comprehend."
3,likes biseinen,I really enjoyed the first book in this series. I wasn't that impressed with 2 and 3. They were okay. I thought by the time I get to four the story should be back in full swing. It's taking a while but I think the story is going to heat up again(not in this volume) I have already read 5 and it ended with a great cliffhanger. I now can't wait to get 6. All in all I say the only reason to read this volume is because it's a part of the series and it sets up some action for 5. Don't expect much action as far as the relationships in 4 or 5. Maybe we'll get some in 6. Could someone let me know?!?!Ranmaru and Kei are still nice to look at no matter what's going on around them.
5,Fantastic History of the golf courses at St. Andrews,"This a complete and well written history on the architecture and development of all the courses at St. Andrews. The pictures and sketches of the golf courses are pretty good too. The book tells the history of all the holes, the bunkers, the names associated with particular holes or bunkers, and the people, organizations and Acts of Parliment in the making of this great golfing mecca."
5,Sport game of the year!,"If you like Basketball Games then you will love this game! If you don't like games which can be fake or maybe, unreal then you might want to rent the game first and then buy it. You also might want to have a memory card or you would have to start your game all over again. I thought that this game was excellent and very, very, very, fun!"
4,Pretty Awsome,This game is alright.You can get alot of great nba players just by winning but who said they were good at street ball?There are alot of courts to choose from but i'd recodmend the street hoops game more because there are actually real street ball players on that game like you see on tv
1,they call this basketball?,"This game can be a fun street game game to play, but please, that's all it does. This game doesn't begin to touch the depth of the Gamecube capabilities. Simply juxtapose it with a Nintendo basketball game, designed directly for the Cube and it's blown away. Presently, NBA Courtside 2002 is Nintendo's representative on the market and it deserves to be held on a level all its own. With several modes of play including both simulation 5 on 5 and a 3 on 3 arcade version similar in play to NBA Street, Courtside simply offers more styles of gameplay with better graphics and controls. There is no reason to waste your money on an unfulfilling game such as NBA Street, especially when games such as NBA Coutside exist."
3,This is a great game...but you get tired of it quickly!,"This game has excellent graphics and almost everything else you can think of.....EXCEPT...you get tired of it after a short while. In city curcuit mode, you play NBA teams from all divisions and they all do nothing different. No player can make a difference. I can beat the game with the Clevland Cavs! If you have someone small...shoot and they almost always make it. If you have someone big, jump and they block it or hit the shoot button and they dunk it....mostly always the same way too. Unless you press a bunch of buttons....then it can be pretty exciting."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,THIS GAME REALLY SUCKS. ITS ONLY FANTASYTHE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT ARE MUCH LEVELS IN STREETS
3,Not Like Amatur videos on playboy channel!,We bought this video thinking it was like the serious on playboy channel. Its not! Its just a bunch of stupid home audition videos that shows hardly anything if ur lucky. The series is actually Adult video this is just a tease with all women in it.
4,good show,"this is a good DVD. it does have lots of nudity, so if you are prude, then this is probably not for you. I like this DVD for me."
1,Not the title I ordered,"I actually ordered, ""Playboy: Hottest Housewives/Exposed Naughty Wives Party (2006)"" not this title. Please see my review of ""Naughty houswives and find out more about the hottest, unutilized talent from playboy, Lara Lasher."
5,enjoyable,"Very enjoyable and informative. Anyone who wants to benefit from true relaxation, creativity, and being immersed in beauty will be estactic about this book. This books helps experience beauty, not from standing apart and looking from a frontal position, but from a knowledge that we are in the beauty, the balance, and the peace.gloria Ruiz"
1,Smells different,I have sampled the same perfume in Macy's multiple times (before and after my purchase) and the one I got from Amazon doesn't smell anything like that. I can only assume it's old or stale. I could say this for most perfumes that my family purchased from Amazon. Better to stay away from Amazon when it comes to perfumes.
5,Just perfect!,"I purchased this ukulele for my 2 year old grand daughter. She loves it! It's size is perfect for her to pretend that she's playing a guitar. It's solid, made well and a great bargin for the price."
2,Boring,"It seemed that this movie was made to answer a lingering question from a previous movie but, it did not answer the question. I will avoid this director in the future, he has stung me once. However, if you are learning French it is not too difficult to understand. The characters speak clearly and they do not use a lot of much slang so it is good for practicing your French."
2,Could have been better quality,"Bought this for my grandson. Hard back - damage on outside. Glued it for him, but was very disappointed in the quality. He wanted it so I fixed it and let him have it."
5,Fits right in with the latest Warp releases.,"Along the same vein as Mouse on Mars, mu-ziq, and Orbital, Vrumjaago was a very pleasant surprise. The melodies are very well thought out, but not too poppy. The beats are brilliantly arranged, though simpler than mu-ziq they still hold a similar quality. Some of the material successfully echoes Warp's Artificial Intelligence series, which is a lot to say for an American white kid.Highly reccommended to people tired of the same old Fatboy."
2,Not pleased,"The charger was sent as indicated in the advertisement however, the seller did not send the dock along with the charger as indicated. The seller was contacted and did not respond to the email sent requesting the dock be sent. Without the dock, the system can not be used as desired. Therefore, I rate this seller as unreliable."
5,Marty is back better than ever,"We recognize the voice right off. How can you not know the voice behind the Shenandoah hits? I listen to this album at least twice a week. I like Marty's voice because I feel he sings sincerity better than anyone in the industry. ""That's That"" written by Hugh Prestwood is lyrically perfect and no one could sing it better than Marty. This man deserves to be heard on a major label. Marty is one of if not the most talented singer around and does not get the credit he deserves. To me this album was underproduced but with Marty's voice and talent, it is not noticable unless you are a music critic like me but it still gets five stars from me because of the material on this album. Yea, I think Marty should not have left Shenandoah but they too were wearing out and it is time this guy gets the attention he deserves as the major singer on his own. Buy it.. it is worth every cent."
1,Don't think I received what I ordered,"Ordered these through Amazon and ended up returning them. The part number on the box was the same as what the site shows, but no where on the box did it state these were TitaniuMetallic2 Brake Pads. All it says on the box is ""Bendix O.E. Formulated Brake Pads"". And these are not the split pad, riveted pads as the description would have you believe. These look like a regular set of bonded pads which you can get for half the price.I am giving these a low rating because I don't even know if these are suppose to be what I ordered. They look completely different so I didn't install them, thus I can't comment on the actual performance of the pads."
4,Great for the Fidgety Teen!,"I bought this Digital Drum for my fidgety 14 year old daughter. She is always beating on something, and I thought that she would really enjoy this! She did, and all of her friends want one now! I look forward to hearing her really get going on it!"
3,Not a replacement for drums,This item was given to my son for a gift since we did not have room for an actual drum set. In our opinion it is basically a toy and not a replacement for drums. He did not use it much so we actually ended up getting him a drum set.
1,Nothing more than a manual for child abuse.,A horrid little piece of trash that tries to make you think that God wants you to abuse your children. One wonders what can made a so called Christian so mean-spirited and child hating.
1,Get this book off the shelves,How can we still be selling a book that advocates child abuse? No one should buy this book.
1,Doing the Lord's Work,"Southern slaveholders in America used the Bible to justify beating their slaves, too. If you want to dehumanize your children, read this book. It'll make you feel good about it."
1,Spanking and conservative Christian don't go together!,"I am a very conservative Christian- we homeschool, don't have rock music in our home, limit TV use, about as conservative as you can get- and we don't spank.The simple reason: Do I hit my children, or do I teach my children? Hitting is not teaching. And there is nothing to distinguish spanking from hitting but the name (and in England, they're more honest and call it 'smacking') The Scriptures command us to discipline, not to spank. The ""rod"" is a symbol for authority.And to Beth, since I can't PM her- if she looks here again- thank you SO much for writing that review. God bless you!I would recommend ""Biblical Parenting"" by Crystal Lutton, ""The Discipline Book"" by Dr. Sears, or ""Parenting with Grace"" by Gregory Popack for parents looking for discipline ideas based on faith and scientific evidence as to what is best for our children."
1,Those pictures are absolutely sickening....,Do you notice in those pictures the redness and the bruising of their bottoms. Disgusting!! I am a Christian and God has put it in my heart to never lay a hand on my child. Instead He lead me to research and implement Gentle Discipline and Grace Based Parenting. Not spanking does not equal no discipline. It means better discipline.Robin
1,Why do you need a manual to hurt your child?,"How can someone write a book completely devoted to hitting a child's private area?What kind of book writes things like (p.80) ""A spanking must be long enough and hard enough to bring a child to a place of repentance.""Shouldnt it be your words, reasoning and confidence that show children to listen to you , following their conscience? Saying that hitting someone viciously enough so that the hitting itself brings ""confessions"" is like torturing a prison victim to confession.Yeah and spanking builds up your self-image? Can you see a little girl saying ""Mommy spanks me every day, and I am so I proud of it!"" ""Nothing gets me down because I submit to vicious hitting of my private areas at home!"""
1,NO STARS - book should be burned,"People like this give Christianity and Yeshua a bad name.WAKE UP CHURCH!!! The only thing that separates TRUE followers of the Messiah from religious zealots fo chrisitanity and all relgions alike, is LOVE. Love is not spanking/physically hitting someone when they do somethign ""wrong"".Coming from a spanking family, we vowed not to spank, and our child is so incredibly confident in himself as well as in our relationship. If you spank, you can be assured that your child will never share his/her inmost problems with you.Very plainly, it's a matter of perspective. If you believe God punishes for every wrong-doing, then your focus is on behavior, and in short, on your performance before GOD. There's no grace in that, and then when you fall short, your salvation is jeopardized.Get a life - and I mean a REAL one. Jesus came to SAVE us, not SPANK us!!!"
1,This is Child Abuse!,"If I could give this zero stars I would. DO NOT BUY A BOOK THAT TEACHES YOU HOW TO ABUSE YOUR CHILDREN. If you need more convincing not to buy this book, read Beth Fenimore's account of what it was like to receive this kind of discipline (it's included in one of the other one star reviews). Beth's parents were close family friends of the Lessins and her father illustrated Roy Lessin's first spanking book."
1,"It's abuse, plain and simple.",Just read the review that contains the letter from the 19 year old. It says it all. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
2,This book makes the Divine Comedy look like Dante's Inferno.,"As our society moves closer to the millenium, we (society) as a whole is developing the dire need for proper disciplinary methods. Spanking appears to be the only method that has withstood the test of time throughout the ages, so therefore, it is spanking that will carry us into the millenium, and will in turn cater to armaggeddon which looms over all of us. It is imperitive that spanking be kept in its pure and natural form, so when mankind undergoes the ""baptism by fire"" we will be able to discipline ourselves during the aftermath of the apocalypse.This book is an accurate description of proper spanking procedures and is fairly reliable. The author has undoubtedly found favour with the Great Leader in order to manufacture such and enlightened work."
1,But it's not science,"I don't mean to argue with someone's interpretation of the Bible, but I think it's at least worth considering the scientific research on this topic as well.In an extensive meta-analysis recently published in a leading scientific journal (Psychological Bulletin, 2002), psychologist Elizabeth Gershoff found links between spanking and 10 negative behaviors or experiences, including aggression, antisocial behavior, and mental health problems. The only positive result of spanking that Dr. Gershoff identified was quick compliance with parental demands.This is why the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other child health organization, are officially against spanking...."
1,"A ""how to"" guide","A ""how to"" guide to child abuse... great idea...an justifing the abuse by using religion...inspired....look for Lessin's next book--""Molestation: A Loving Education : Helpful and Practical Answers for Today's Parents""by Roy Lessin"
1,Working Titles for a Horrible Book,"Perhaps a better title for this book would be ""An Idiot's Guide to Child Abuse"" or ""How to be Charged with Child Abuse"" or ""Take the Easy Route- Beat Your Child into Submission to Avoid Time Consuming Scientifically Proven Parenting Methods"". Why is Lessin still being published?"
1,But it's not science,"I don't mean to argue with someone's interpretation of the Bible, but I think it's at least worth considering the scientific research on this topic as well.In an extensive meta-analysis recently published in a leading scientific journal (Psychological Bulletin, 2002), psychologist Elizabeth Gershoff found links between spanking and 10 negative behaviors or experiences, including aggression, antisocial behavior, and mental health problems. The only positive result of spanking that Dr. Gershoff identified was quick compliance with parental demands.This is why the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other child health organization, are officially against spanking.An excellent book on this subject is Dr. Murray Straus' ""Beating the Devil Out of Them: Corporal Punishment by American Families and Its Effects on Children"" (2002). If you think you must hit your child, please at least read this first."
1,Using religion to parent with violence,"Yet another parenting book written by a non-expert, religious zealot who uses isolated passages in scripture to validate the use of violence in parenting children. For those parents with little creativity who are looking to have an excuse to hit their children validated. Generally gentle, loving illustrations are used to take the sting out of the books real message---hit children."
5,Rave Review,"Excellent book! Folks tend to swing toward extremes with child discipline, either physical abuse or no discipline whatsoever, which is also a form of child abuse, though much less publicized. Lessin hits the nail on the head, helping folks to understand what Godly, loving, firm, yet compassionate discipline looks like."
1,A Guide to Child Abuse,"The author of this book uses and promotes physical, emotional and mental abuse of children in order to make a child obedient.And he does it in God's name.There will come a time when this book is withdrawn from publication and it's author put behind bars for the child abuse he has encouraged over many years.There are many grown adults still broken today because of the torturous childhood they endured in direct response to the sickened instruction of Roy Lessin.Do not support this monster or his methods."
1,Child Abuse Manual Justified by Religion,A disgusting little book that tries to use religion as a justificatiion for lousy parenting and child abuse. Awful.
1,Spanking can lead to hatred,"My mother spanked me once, even though she wasn't averse to face-slapping. Very likely Lessin's piece of garbage does reflect today's ""Christian"" view (religious Right's view), with which I have no sympathy at all. I have NEVER forgiven my mother for having laid hands on me, even though she's been dead 7 years, and I likely never WILL forgive her. Had I been able to choose which parent would have survived the other, I'd have wanted my dad to do so, but unfortunately she was the survivor. The author appears to me to be an out-and-out sadist and I hope any unfortunate child of his will be revenged on him one day."
1,We spank our slaves too!,"This is a wonderful book! I love how I feel encouraged in beating my children when they need it. I tear their behinds up, in the name of the Lord of course.The other day, our slave got out of line after I scolded her for burning our dinner. So I took her out back and whipped her just like the Bible says to. The children were delighted."
1,Horrible,"If you are looking for a book on parenting, this is NOT THE ONE!!! This ""man"" gives horrible, disgraceful advice that is meant to hurt, smother and confuse a child. I am offended that this book could even get published. The author should be very ashamed of his actions against his child!"
1,GREAT..A BOOK ON HOW TO BEAT A CHILD,"It still amazes me[...]can advocate beating a child's sexual parts under the guise of discipline. Yes, the buttocks ARE a sexual area of the body. Deal with it. There is NEVER an excuse to strike a child on ANY part of the body...or to strip a child naked and beat them. How can people condone spanking? If someone foddled a child's buttocks, these same ""advocates"" of spanking would scream bloody murder. But, it's ok to hit a child's buttocks? Huh? Can someone please explain this double standard? It is absolutely sick that [...]condones removing a child's clothing (which ALSO exposes the child's private areas...a boy's penis and scrotum or a girl's vagina)...and this is acceptable discipline? This author is absolutely sick."
1,Why is it OK to beat little people?,"Besides the fact that adults can press charges even though little kids are defenseless, how is it OK for an adult who supposedly loves a child to beat them? Apart from the physical abuse, what about the emotional and mental trauma inflicted on the child? Do you really want your child to be afraid of you? If so, what does that say about you?I cannot believe this thing got past someone at Amazon and is actually being sold. It's disgusting and heart-breaking that it even got published. How sad for the children of those who purchase this book."
1,Disgusting,Wow. Just wow. How sick can a parent be that they have to take their emotional problems out on tormenting their kids this sexual and violent way? SICK. Do not support this man. This is a ritualistic way of tormenting innocent children. Please do not fall for this.
1,Amazon reconsider your stocks!,"I cannot believe you stock spanking books by Roy Lessin - are you aware the man is basically advocating physical abuse of very young children? Perhaps you should google his name and read the open letter written to him by Beth Fenimore about the lifetime of damage his spanking rituals caused her. I would urge you to reconsider selling these books, lest one more child be damaged by his words."
1,The Bible for Child Abusers,"This is THE classic text for child abusers who have learned that they can hide behind a mistranslation of God's word. If you are a child abuser who gets a big thrill out of hurting and damaging children for life while pretending to be a Christian, this is THE book for you. Get it today and get copies for all your child abusing friends, too. But be quick before Amazon finally wakes up to the fact of how incredibly unethical it is to stock a book like this and finally takes it off the shelves."
1,"The Truth Is That Right Wing ""Christians"" Are Child Abusers","This guy advises hitting kids with a stick. That is child abuse.You Reich-Wingnut ""Christians"" support child abuse. But that figures, you support our Chimp-in-Chief, who okayed torture as US policy.""A parent will be able to discern in a child's cry when he or she has broken..."" (from the book)BROKEN? As in what the CIA torture techniques do. Break the kid down.That's psychological abuse on top of the physical abuse!!You supposedly morally superior ""Christian"" whackos make me SICK."
1,Jesus wept...,"Let me start by saying that I have read this book. I am shocked and saddened that a book like this even got published. The fact that it was published under the guise of ""Christian"" parenting manual is even more disturbing.I don't recall Jesus ever physically assaulting anyone in the bible, much less a child. In fact, he pretty much shunned violence in every situation. So, whose example do you want to follow?"
2,Worthless,Owned this stuff years and years and years ago.. Smelled great then and I wanted more.. but the spray mechanism broke back in the day after I used about 70 percent of the bottle... This time it just arrived broke.. I understand that things wear out after time.. and that failures are bound to occur.. but why would a company put a great smelling cologne in a bottle that makes it virtually worthless.. it's ridiculous..will not buy again..
4,Op Juice by Ocean Pacific,"Everything about it is wonderful, except one of the two cologne sprays. The dispenser has malfunctioned and will not deliver any cologne."
1,Wow,I bought two bottles of this and the spray top doesn't work so they can not be used. Its sad because its my favorite and its stuck in the bottle. This is probably one of OP s biggest issues with it.
5,as described,Op Juice By Ocean Pacific For Men. Cologne Spray 2.5 Ouncesvery good from description - transaction! i just wish you'll give instruction inside because some people don't know that you have to push the tip first to unlocked the cologne. other than that I'll rate it 10
1,terrible service,"I received a bottle of cologne that I ordered, but it arrived with a broken sprayer. Therefore, I can not do anything with the cologne. I emailed the company and Amazon my issue, yet received no response from either . I am pissed ! What do you do with a cologne that you can't get out of the bottle? Please consumers, there are many places on Amazon to buy cologne from. Take it from me, do not buy anything from this company. Maybe they'll get what's coming to them and go out of business. They sold me a defective item, and no one bothered to apologize, fix the issue, or anything."
1,CELERY JUICE ON CRACK,I did a blind buy of this OP Juice and I must say it's the worst smell ever for a cologne I tried. I should of listened to one of the negative reviews because this cologne smells like CELERY JUICE on crack.
5,Best Oven Cleaner Yet,"Easy to use. Less toxic than its competitors. Clean up is not messy or time consuming. Simply spray on, let it stand for a few hours and then wipe up with a wet sponge and warm water. Finish off with a dry kitchen towel. A small palm sized-scrubbee will remove stubborn spots quickly. Have used this without rubber gloves without any ill effect.In my opinion, far superior to ""Easy Off"". Carbona is faster, easier and does a better job without the toxic nastiness."
2,Pen dries up too fast!,"I really love the book, and I bought two of them but the pens dried up in less than a week. Should put a great pen to match a great book."
4,"Great item, but little lefties beware!","This book definitely got my four year old son's attention, but he was less than pleased when the ink, which is a bit slow to dry, smeared all over his left hand as he wrote. Too bad - I think it would be great for righties, though!"
1,bad shape,"I ordered this book. i was a used book, but it was in really bad shape. the website said slight shelf damage. the book was in really bad shape. it should have been thrown out instead of being put up for sale."
5,Very Motivating,"I can't really explain why, but my 5-year old enjoys writing in this book so much more than pencil and paper. The pen that comes with it does not last long, but the book is what you are really buying. We bought a set of dry erase markers in various colors to add to the fun. The book wipes clean easily."
5,My 3 and a half year old son LOVES this book!,"My son received this for his 3rd birthday and he loves it! He has learned to write many letters on his own, because of this book. He still traces some of them, but I am pretty sure this is the book that helped him to recognize all of his letters. As we went through it once a week, I helped him learned the sound each of the letters make. Now he knows how to recognize, say, write, and sound out each letter. At three and a half he is already learning to sound out words and read. This book is one of the tools we use. We have been using it for 7 months now and the marker has still not dried out - but you have to make sure the cap clicks - which an adult really needs to do, because it's a little tough to get closed all the way.I purchased it when it was more expensive than it is now, and I thought it was a good deal then - it's a true bargain right now!"
3,GBA all the way!!!,"OK,here's what I did today.First,I went to Blockbuster to rent a PS2 and ""Britney's Dance Beat."" When I got home I was very excited to play it. I was impressed with it for awhile. The graphics are awesome and the music was great. Then I got further on and got a little furstrated.I got boared a little too easy. The GBA version (which I own)is a lot better than this for a reason I can't really explain.By the way,they don't use Britney's real voice when she talks and you can't really play as her.Other than that it was pretty fun compared to those other star's video games out at the moment(Nsync and spice girls)."
5,GOOD... but could have been better,"I have been a Britney Spears fan for a long time. I absolutly love her. This game is really fun if you can get the hang of it. I have played video games for a long, but i have never played a game that has ...made me so mad, because the game is kinda unfair. But excellent game, graphics, and everything else. Recommended to everybody, but not to anybody with a short temper like me!"
2,another screw up in the making,"Well two stars just because I like Bemani type games...I find it a disturbing fact that they would dilute the bemani playing field with a game based off of britney spears songs. sure one or two nsync, backstreet boys, or britney songs mixed in to ddr or beatmania is ok but an entire game????...anyways, find it kind of sad that this kind of game has to be for the ps2 probably would get a bigger audience if it was for all the playstations. either way most of britney spears songs are a bit too slow for my liking to be able to do ddr type stuff on it..."
2,hailed as one of the worst games ever,"G4TV said this was one of the worst games ever. well, it's certainly up there.The graphics are pretty good. The cgi Britney looks like Britney and this game will remind you of Britneys better days when she was doing ""oops I did it again"". In the background you get just about the entire music video and song.Okay, this is why the game is crappy. First, the game is hard to control with the PS2 controller because the buttons are sensitive and you need to push them quick. Furthermore, when you mess up the dancer on the screen doesnt mess up. No matter how good or bad you do, you watch the same CGI dance loop over and over.the 2 stars are for the good Britney CGI character, her music videos and the songs. THQ should have done a cool Britney game...something creative like Britneys space adventures or western"
3,Ok needs more Levels,"This video game is fun when you first play it, but it gets very boring. The levels dont seem to ever change, and the song selection is very limited. I suggest if you want to buy this game, rent it first!pros- it is fun and a challenge wen u first start it, graphics are very good in quality with good soundcons- needs a lot more selection of songs, levels, players and gets boring after palying 2 or 3 times."
1,Not that great,"When I play a video game, I want to indulge my fantasies. The premise of this game is that you can become a back-up dancer. That's right - the best you can do is become a back up dancer. This game is perfect for people who dissappoint themselves, even in their fantasies. You shouold be able to become the head dancer and replace Britney Spears. Now THAT would be entertainment."
4,Fun,"I am a 24 year old female, and I thoroughly enjoy this game. I bought it, as well as the dance beat pad, last night. It is very entertaining and good exercise. I just wish it had more of a selection of songs."
3,Not so Hott,The game is okay but could have been a little bit more. All you do on the playstation version is press the four buttons. You cant make her dancers dance you press the button when it tells you to. It takes way to long tobeat. I am a big britney fan and i wished the game was funner. The graphics are pretty good but you have to beat four dances twice. Once yo ubeat th efour you get theh same dances but harder. You have to start pressing 2 buttons at once which is very confusing. You get points for completing dances.With so many points you get backstage passes.The passes let you watch her practice a song for a concert. After beating eight dances you finally get to go be a dancer. I still am not there. To try beating it you need a memory card to save or you have to start over again. It might be fun to some who would have fun pressing the four buttons.It made me pretty mad. You should probably rent before you buy. I wouldnt pay more than 20.00 . I love britney but didnt care for the game.
4,pretty good,i gave this game 4 stars because its averageat first it was really kewl but after playing it 4 a few hours u get bored. when u first play the game its really really easy but towards the end...it gets extremely hard i can only get up to audition 8. there're only 12 leves and 5 songs nd 6 characters. Also everytime u choose a new character to play you havta start new game.. id rather choose a new character withot starting a game. Also u can't see the commands that it gives u becuz there'r too any bckround colors too many things r going on to see wut ur dancer is doing... the graphics r crisp and very smooth nevertheless. the dancers move smoothly and cleanly. also the extra fotage and rehearsal footages r amazing... overall good game but lacks in length
3,Entertaining but doesnt show much,This Game is entertaining but I bought this game thinking you can learn her dance moves like they say but you dont! you only hit arrows and dont even learn how to dance like Britney..So I would recommend this on some cases but to learn to dance like Britney I wouldnt..I would recommend for dancing Dance Dance Revolution!!
4,Neet game,"Great graphic's on this game. If you beat the audition mode, you get to play as Britney, pretty cool.Yeah, it only has a few songs and that kind of blows but the rest of the game is pretty fun."
1,britney needs more dance,"i bought this game for my 10 year old daughter who practically worships britney. She just had to have this game as a collection of britney stuff.but unfortunately she hated it it was such a rip off theres only 5 stages to choose from and after u complete them...thats it no more stages to play,then u just get to start over again. ive watched her play and it dosnt seem like that much fun, i dont recomend this game to anyone."
3,Will NEVER be as good as Dance Dance Revolution!,"As a REAL back-up dancer, and hardcore player of the game that Britney's was based on (the arcade game Dance Dance Revolution) I can honestly say that this her's pales in comparision. I mean, your playing the game and the best you can ever hope to be is BACK-UP, and HER character's not even playable? What up with THAT? If you're looking for a real challenge and a wider variety of music (Jazz, Pop, Techno) stick with the original and buy Dance Dance Revolution for PS2, or get your butt in gear and go play it at your local arcade. :o)"
2,Disappointing,"The graphics are good, but my nine year old daughter was under the impression it was about dancing. Really the main focus is on the two circles at the bottom of the screen and pushing the correct button sequence, with dancers in the background. It's overpriced and it's lame. If you are a die hard Britney fan, rent it first then decide if you want to pay (to own it)."
4,RENT FIRST,"You should probably do yourself and your kids a favor by renting this game. If you have some spare time to play your PS2, it's possible to beat this in the amount of time you can rent it for. This game will seem fairly easy for ""gamers"" who are used to the buttons. If you can press the correct button, sometimes with a direction on the D-pad at the same time, you will smoke this game. For others, you might have to work for it..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,Brittny's dance beat is really bad. If you want to play it you might as well just watch tellytubbies because the game is that bad and it will take you that long to beat. Playing it is about as fun as staring at air. In my oponion I have three words for you DON'T BUY IT!
5,International Star - Excellent Concert,"Eros Ramazzotti's ""9"" Tour is excellent. Great performance filmed at Olympic Stadium in Rome, Italy 2004. His Music is powerful and true. Big bonus - to see Eros perform probably his greatest song ""Adesso Tu"". Disc 2 is very cool; 3 Specials - Backstage to the Concert from Rome, Behind The Scenes from his World Tour (Moscow to Buenos Aires) with even Enrique Iglesias popping up with him backstage for a little, and a Concert for the Kids in Milan, Italy. Overall, this is an excellent MUSIC DVD, with Digital 5.1 Sound, and Eros really does a top notch performance."
1,Not a Good Experience,"I bought the DVD and once it gets to song 12 it pauses...and then it plays and I can not listen to the entire song. I tried contacting by email to let them know that I am having issues with the DVD and I would like to send that back and for them to send me another one, but no luck."
2,Zip ties hold it together,This piece looks pretty good except it immediately broke. I realized that the leather was held to the frame with thin zip ties!! What the heck? It shows medal links on the picture. Was this a mistake?? Not sure but disappointed as I now need to jimmy rig it to work.
1,"Good movie, bad quality of recording","Actually I loved the movie itself but the quality was so bad - garbled sound track, visuals looking like someone held a camera up to a TV while playing a video tape - that I can't imagine trying to watch it again. I was sadly disappointed, as I love the books by Zenna Henderson, and thought that this movie was fairly faithful to them, and I always enjoy William Shatner."
5,Saw this as a kid.,This is a great movie that impressed me when it came out as a tv movie in 1972. I would occasionally think about it and wonder what it was called & if I'd ever find it. Still a great movie!
2,Waiting for the re-mastered version,"I remember seeing this made-for-tv movie when it was first broadcast in the early 70's. I was only 8 years old but it left a mark and I have thought about the movie through out the years. When I decided to track it down last year I found that it was based on ""The People Stories"" by Zenna Henderson. I had no idea! I immediately bought the book here at Amazon and LOVED it! Then, on a whim, searched for it at Youtube and the whole movie is there (for free). Yes, it is definitely a lower budget 70's tv movie but I just loved it. After reading the reviews here, I won't be buying this version but I do hope a non ""bootleg"", digitally re-mastered/restored version will someday be released. And I agree with the reviewer whom suggested a remake because the message is relevant anywhere, anytime."
2,"Sweet movie, terrible copy","Agree with the others here... I've been a Zenna Henderson fan forever, and the movie, while dated, is a sweet interpretation of her stories.The DVD looks like it was a 3rd generation VHS copy transferred to digital format. Plain white label that looks like it was printed from a home computer. I really wonder if this is really a legitimate copy or a bootleg."
1,Warning! The People (1972-USA) DVD,"This DVD simply cannot be a legal copy. It comes in a generic clear DVD box without artwork. The DVD media is a DVD-R. The content of the DVD is either a VCR capture or, more likely, a camcorder capture of a 8 or 16 mm film copy.The image is out of focus.The color is washed out.The audio is, in the second half, out of sync.I could do better in my garage with a 20 year old computer and a camcorder!Mad Phat Enterprises, the current ""publisher"" of this video should be ashamed to even sell such items.Finally, Amazon should immediately stop selling all products from this company. Selling products in this condition gives Amazon a bad name. If I, as a consumer, cannot trust the products on Amazon to be legal and of good quality my purchases WILL go elsewhere.It's such a shame too. I really looked forward to seeing this old film again."
1,worst ever vhs to dvd transfer,This transfer from vhs is the worst I have ever seen. The video was amplified to the point that it looks all washed out. The sound is awful. 2/3 of the way through the story the tape evidently broke and they restarted it with wavering audio and video from the tape that was not tensioned properly and produced continues bands of noise through the video. If you are going to make a dvd from a video at least disclose that is what it is. This mess has gone way beyond just false advertising. It is simply a fraud. 20 bucks for garbage. I want my money back. What really pisses me off is that this production by Francis Ford Coppola was truly great for the amount of money he was given. He did a great job. The purported copy of it is garbage.
5,"Hard to find, never put on DVD...sadly.","It's not that the acting is so wonderful, in fact it isn't. But the film is wonderful, the story from Zenna Henderson's books is worth the find of this tv movie. You will find yourself thinking of the 1970's when you watch it. A time when people were a little more open to alternative ideas, and space people. It's innocence is refreshing. If I say anything more, I will ruin the plot."
2,Could have been a lot better; could have been worse (maybe),"A Zenna Henderson fan from way back, I wanted to like it. I've hunted for a copy for a long time. However, the writers took a mishmash of pieces from the short stories and stitched them together like a frankenstein monster to make a series of events without any of the power and magic in the originals. Kim Darby did the best she could with what she had. William Shatner did not have any of Dr. Curtis' irascible persona to work with. And Valancy was downright creepy while Karen was a negative bystander instead of a supportive mover-and-shaker. It's way past time for this set of stories to be remade. Today's technology could make a spectacular, enchanting trilogy out of Pilgrimage, The People, and The Anything Box. I'd like to see it set in New Mexico and Arizona, too."
1,A New Low,"I have seen some shoddy bootlegs in my time, but this beats all. The only thing ""new"" about this dvd is the disc used to transfer a poor-quality vhs tape onto it. The picture quality and sound were poor from the beginning. However it got even worse at the point where the screen said: ""Please wait while the reel is changed!?"" After that the sound didn't even match up with the actors' lips and the music sounded like a strangled turkey in its death throws!!I'm sending it back and I'll NEVER buy from this seller again!!!"
3,"Great story, dreadful transfer to DVD","I absolutely love Zenna Henderson's science fiction tales about the People and was happy to find this movie. Still love the story, but the transfer to DVD was incredibly inept. I will hang on to it, but I am rooting for some young filmmaker to update the film in a remake."
1,"NEED ""NEW"" COPY","I have seen this TV made movie at the time i was in high school. So, that was a long, long time ago...I always enjoyed viewing this movie time and time again; for some reason or another. I read all the reviews on ""Amazon.com"" before buying the DVD which I was happy to find. But to my disappointment MOST everyone did not like the ""copy"" of the film. So, sadly I did not buy the DVD. My wish is that someone who has connections to the ""source"" have them make a copy of the original movie and produce a worth while DVD to the many viewers that appreciate a good story."
1,Don't buy this horrible copy,"I bought this DvD knowing it was a copy of a movie from the seventies that is no longer in production. Even so, I am deeply disappointed in what arrived. A disc arrived in a clear plastic cover, with no attempt to recreate the film art. When I tried to show it to my kids, it played as a pirated second hand copy, with awful sound production. Near the end of the film there was a break to a black screen with the message ""please wait while we start the second reel."" After this pause, the film did resume but with a horribly distorted soundtrack. The music was ruined, and the dialogue was out of sync with the speaking mouths. It was impossible to watch the climax.While I didn't expect a new and shiny production value, I did at least expect to be able to watch it all the way through and appreciate it for the movie it once was. This should not be sold by amazon, and no one else should buy it. Even if you are really desperate--as I was--to watch this old classic."
1,Confused PEOPLE,"For anyone who loves THE PEOPLE stories stories of author Zenna Henderson (collected inIngathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson), this tv movie is bound to be a crushing disappointment. The script mashes together more than one of Henderson's short stories, resulting less quality and less of a sense of the original stories. Don't base your decision to read Henderson's works on this movie. Worse, the script confuses the Peacenik culture of the time with the sensibly pacific culture of ""the People"" of the stories. While Kim Darby is a good choice for the new teacher, others aren't, eg, William Shatner and Diane Varsi (in a come-back attempt). To sum up: Wretched."
2,The People,"I loved this show many years ago and this is the only DVD copy I could find to buy. So, I love the story, BUT, whoever made this apparently has an old reel projector that they are taking a video from. The color is often bleached out and after a pause to change reels some of the sound is wavery and out of sync. I returned the first copy hoping the problem was a single bad copy. No such luck. I'm keeping the second copy because I like the story. Definitely NOT because of the quality of the product."
5,Shag lovers will love to measure the passage of time...,"This is a GREAT calendar... such a FUN addition to a cubicle wall, a kitchen fridge, or pinned to your leopard print velvet wallpaper while you sit in your eames chair and sip your martini! :D TERRIFIC GIFT FOR SHAG LOVERS!"
1,terrible kit!!!!!!,this is a horrible kit. it is easier to make your own. i had to glue this about 20 times and the guide rails are way to short. also the 5/8 of an inch lines the maglev kit says to put the guide rails on are to far apart. you should not buy this kit.
2,just ok,"this toy gives you the idea behind a levitated train, but it is hard to get it to work. hard to keep the train from hitting the sides, good starting point needs further development"
3,LevitationSetMagnetic,"Great idea with yet to be imroved quality. Parts of the set continue to stay apart due to week adhesive. As I witnessed my children into the activity, it seemed to cause more frustration than fun, although the group of them did manage to put the whole piece together for ... a short span of time."
1,Worst toy in history,"I have bought this toy thinking it would be fun for my kid to play with magnets and maybe learn something in the process. I don't want to go into detailed description, but this so-called ""toy"" is not something a kid will play with, regardless of age. It includes several square magnets, some round magnets, a couple of rubber ribbon magnets, a nail, a couple of wooden blocks, some pieces of plastic and that's basically it. The manual includes some ""activities"", which basically represent instructions like ""put magnet A on magnet B and see they repel. turn them over and now they attract. wow! now let's go to the next activity"". All of those activities require extra stuff such as coins, bricks, sticky tape, strings, and even contact cement, which is not included in the box.Doesn't worth a dime. Seriously."
1,This produc is terrible don't buy!,I hated this product you could build a better levitating train at home the train project in this kit did not work at all at first just got stuck to other magnet but when it did work it did not move easily overall i hated this product and would not recommend buying it.
1,Piece of junk save your money,Components in the kit are worth about 3 dollars at best. The guide rails came bent and the magnets are weak. You can easily build a better kit at home. The train project doesn't work well at all.
2,Shotgun stock kit,It was very difficult to install. It was not like I thought it would be. The instructions were minimal and not very helpful. I will be honest andsay that I am not a gunsmith but I thought it would be easier to install. It is sitting in my closet and will go unused.
5,Hogue Stock Kit with Forend is well worth the money.,This was the third 870 Hogue Stock kit with Forearm I have installed and like the other two this one fit and looks great.
