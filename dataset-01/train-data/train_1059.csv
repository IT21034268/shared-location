5,A must buy!,"I come from a family of caucasians, many of us with skin cancer as early as our twenties.After that family history, we ALL now use this! What a top of the line product! It does not change the texture of the clothing or anything, just makes it safer! I even use it on my baby's clothes and she has no reaction!I HIGHLY suggest this product for everyone - why not add something to your laundry that could save your life?"
4,"So far, so good","I have had skin cancer twice and am only 38. I am a landscaper and wanted extra protection, so I purchased this product and have washed 90% of my clothes in it. It's easy to use and did not discolor any of my clothes. Since it's recommended by the American Cancer Society, I assume they've tested it and it works. It's good for 20 washings or so, which is way cheaper than buying that sun protective clothing (expensive and limited style). I only gave it 4 stars because I don't really have any real experience yet with the clothes I washed - I'll let you know after I go to Mexico in a few weeks!"
1,Pricing is Way Out of Line,"It is Buyer Beware all over again. Amazon is one of the first places I come to look when sourcing a product. But more and more I find sources like this one - Beauty911 or SpinBlessing - that are just profiteering on the customer base that Amazon built over the years. The pricing and the shipping costs can look more and more like the scam sites that set up on ebay. Too bad. The product: 1oz of SunGuard is easily found at $1.99 per ounce if you look also for the manufacturer - ""Phoenix Brands"" as identified in a strong article on skin protection found in the April 27 2010 Wall street journal. The only disappointed is Amazon is not a distributor."
2,Not large but EXTRA LARGE,The bag was too big i use it as a bag to keep perfume accessories when i am traveling . It is to big to wear with an outfit
4,Interesting read,"While being a bit heavy to read, it is very interesting. If you liked the history and truth bits to the Davinci Code you will find this a worthwhile purchase.I wouldn't take the views in it word for word. It is well researched and documented but there is the element of the authors personals views as well. So read it and formulate your own conclusion based on the facts presented."
4,Just another theory,"So, the author thinks that the future king of England is the anti Christ, just because the prince is into off the wall new age beliefs and wants to be the future king of Europe. According to the author the prince has all familiy ties and religious ties that will one day make him the king of Europe or the so called anti Christ. The royal emblem, according to the author is the same thing described in the Bible describing the beast in revalations. This idea was interesting. I can believe that the prince and the royal family are very corupt and involved in secret societies to manipulate the world but to go as far to say that the prince is the anti Christ, give me a brake. Although I disagreed with some of the concepts in this book, it is very entertaining and filled with a whole lot of great informaion. This book is well worth reading."
1,The antichrist and a cup of tea,"Book was in physical good condition, but the book had a strong odor of smoke or mold."
4,Interesting take on the Anti-Christ,"I have emailed Tim Cohen. His theology apparently does not effect what he writes in this book.There are many things of interest in this book. Learning to read a coat of arms is very thought provoking. Learning about the Duke of York's coat of arms is even more interesting.He takes a whole chapter on British Israelism, indicating that the Prince knows this idea and embraces it. He also reviews that the Prince is now the defender of faith, not the defender of the faith.However fancy this book may turn out to be, it is an interesting read on royalty and on the Prince in general."
3,Too Deep for Me,"It's interesting, but goes into such detail, it was just too deep for me. I find some of this hard to believe, though anything is possible I suppose. The concept is interesting, I must say. Just wasn't ""my cup of tea"", no pun intended."
3,Fascinating but sometimes subjective,"Since I myself am an author of a book on Revelation,The Messianic Revelation Series V1 Announcing: Judgment Day, I am not going to comment on the question of the identity of the anti-christ here. I will say I found Tim Cohen's book captivating reading, including amazing details about the royal family and much more than I ever thought I would learn about heraldry. While the book is clearly well researched and well documented over all, it appeared to be reaching a little too hard to make all the puzzle pieces fit in some places. For example, try as I might to see a leopard in the emblem, the lion's body still looks like a lion to me. Even so, I'm glad I didn't miss this fascinating book."
4,Packed with information,"This book is a great resource for those interested in end-time speculations. The section on heraldry, especially it's dissection and explanation of the symbols used on certain coats-of-arms was fascinating.He makes an interesting case for a possible candidate for the anitchrist, even though I thought he stretched some verses to make them fit his supposition."
5,Outstanding research on the subject of the Antichrist,This exhaustive book compiles a wealth of information providing powerful evidence for the identity of the antichrist. It's inescapable conclusion will be undeniable. The evidence Cohen compiles is overwhelming. VERY interesting stuff.
4,The weakness of man,"_Cleopatra_ is not as strong of an effort as Haggard's more famous novels (She, King Solomon's Mines, etc.) but shows the same themes and concerns that seem to populate most of his narratives. It tells the story of Cleopatra through the eyes of Harmachis, a priest who betrays everything holy for the love of Cleopatra and is himself later betrayed. Haggard's passion for beautiful and fiery women who are somehow beyond the normal laws of society and morality is evident here."
1,Confused.....,Could someone please tell me why the bust of Nefertiti is on the cover of a book about Cleopatra????????
1,Don't buy it,"Don't buy this power washer. I used mine for about three hours the first time and it seemed to work fine. The next day it quite after 15 minutes. I contacted the company and they said they would get back to me. Two months later I decided to see if I could correct the problem myself. I was sure it was the pressure sensor that was the problem. Sure enough, the spring sensor was stuck. In an attempt to free it up, I broke off the rather fragile, brass micro-switch post. Now, the washer motor won't shut off. This would be ok except that the pressure builds to such an extent that the sprayer valve won't open, leaving the unit totally useless."
2,Marginal,"Adequate power, generous electric cord. Many poor design features: light weight and narrow base cause unit to fall over with slightest 'bump', garden hose hook-up to unit VERY dificult to detach, power hose very stiff and unyielding in extension also contributing to units instability, wand detachment and handel detachment fittings stiff and poorly designed requiring tools (channel locks) to operate, units storage devices (hose, electric cord, wands) poorly designed - not a neat package."
4,Perfect for around the house jobs,"I know this is not a high powered, top of the line, peel the paint off of eaves type of pressure washer, but it does work fine for general clean up.I used it on my driveway, patio, cement block walls, plastic furniture, dog house, birdbath, and whatever else I could find...(Love the new toy!)I was happy, my husband was suprised, he thought we didn't need one, until I'd shown him otherwise. Good deal for under 100.00 I recommend."
2,garage,"it worked great the first day, but the next day it didn't start. it broke after the the first day. i couldn't believe it until i noticw it was made in china. i guess you pay what you get. i only paid $60 at amazon."
4,Gettin 'er Done,"Ordered, arrived early, no damage in shipping, all parts in box. Assembly required-one screw for the handle. Easy connections for the inlet, hose, and wand.Had to do the pool deck and this washer did it well. About 20 minutes into the job the turbo nozzle springs a leak, hairline fracture, along the side of the tip so I finish with the other wand without a problem.Went to the company website, registered product, and ordered replacement part for the nozzle in warranty all online-nice.As stated above yes it is a little noisy, but not that bad. Wheels work well and onboard treatment tank for soap or other cleaners was the reason I chose this model over the other ones.For household jobs this is the best choice, I am happy with the results. Driveway is next and then..."
3,Limited Life Pressure Washer,"In the past seven years, we have had to purchase three electric pressure washers because each one failed after only two years of use. The first two were from Karcher, then we switched brands and tried this FAIP. We've come to the conclusion that electric pressure washers are designed to be disposable because none of the machines saw heavy duty, 10 hours max per machine would be a high estimate, each was stored properly, etc. If there is a reason to purchase one brand over another, you might want to consider the FAIP over the Karcher because of the approach of their customer service people. FAIP provides assistance via a live online ""chat"" session. We were informed that many machines freeze up after being stored. They sent us detailed instructions on how to troubleshoot the problem and we tried them all though nothing worked, the motor simply wouldn't start. At Karcher, we were simply told the machines cost too much to repair, to buy another."
3,heck of a powerwasher with a flaw...,like the machine fine - works well and does the job for the size. all the attaboy's this machine receives are erased when you try to unplug the hose with that shiny - slipery nozzle end that is buried inside the casing. whose big idea was it to create such a design - what were they thinking? would I repurchase - maybe
1,Incomplete order!,The power washer arrived without a handle. I contacted customer support: as as of three weeks later...nothing. I will wait a little longer but expect to be returning this product as unsatisfactory.
2,Good Tool,"Had an electric power washer for years.bought this one because of the reviews.Tried it out around the house and I was fully satisfied.Has plenty of power and I like the features that it brings.For the money this is a good power washer,I would recommend it."
3,"Good pressure, but- - - - - - -",I purchased this product in May 2006.The powerwasher did have good water pressure but from the beginning it would shut off and start again until itfinally quit all together. The company doesn't seem to be willing to respond to our pleas on what to do for service.
2,kind of disapointing,"I bought this to replace an 8 year old electric that blew out an internal gasket. It seems to work ok, but I don't really believe the power ratings, it seems similar to a unit rated at about 2/3 the water pressure. Also the rotating head did not work and the manufacturer was absolutely unresponsive both online and on the phone. I was never able to get it replaced."
4,Man With the Screaming Brain/Alien Apocalypse,"I purchased this 2 pack movie selection not long ago. Alien Apocalypse has always been one of my altime favorites of Mr. Campbell and I have enjoyed watching it several times on TV and now on my own DVD. I am very happy with it. On the other hand...the Man with the Screaming Brain has been hard to watch. I have not yet gone through the whole thing so I don't think I can give a fair evaluation of the movie at this time. I start it and I get a little further with each viewing...but so far this has been disappointing to me and slightly painful to watch. However, Alien Apocalypse more than makes up for it and the cost of the set. Sorry I coudn't be more helpful!"
3,man with screaming brain,this is may be a four star but it was to corny for me so i gave it a three star
5,great movie,"This movie was great. Most people, myself included, had never heard of it, but that doesn't mean it won't appeal to many people. It's not a mainstream movie because there isn't a whole lot of action. The actors do a superb job with the scant storyline, especially the little girl, Evan Rachel Wood. Kevin Bacon plays a mentally retarded man, who seems to be a little too intelligent in certain parts, but that is a minor flaw (Bacon, after all, isn't really mentally retarded). The story is one of a friendship between a child and a man who has the mentality of a child, and I think this story is beautiful. I loved it."
5,Masterson shines,This was truly an underrated and overlooked film...the cast gives it its all....but Masterson does the best as a sister whose morals have gone awrty
4,Touching story of a child seeking her identity.,Great performances by Kathy Moriarty and newcomer Evan Rachael Wood somewhat diminished by direction that lacks focus and emphasis. Kevin Bacon gives a standard but effective rendition of a mentally challenged adult befriended by an imaginative and sensitive child in search of a world she only imagines. See it. You'll like it.
3,We're one big sad monster,"Good film for Kevin Bacon.If you liked Karl Childers, you'll appreciate his perfomance."
2,And the two stars are for Mary Stuart Masterson,"This movie is flat out terrible. While the premise of a ""young girl forming an unlikely friendship with a mentally challenged man-child"" sounds great on paper, the execution is awful, right down to the cheesy ""in awhile crocodile"" catchphrase. Kevin Bacon's research into the role apparently involved watching lots of Pee-Wee's Playhouse reruns.The only bright spot in this movie is Mary Stuart Masterson, who does a more than serviceable turn as Bacon's troubled guardian/sister."
5,couldn't put it down,"When this book was given to me as a gift, I had never heard of the author and was unenthusiastic about reading it, but felt obligated. So, imagine my surprise when I found myself staying up the first night until 2 a.m. because I just could not put down the book - it was that interesting, well-written, and emotionally compelling. I did little for the next two days except carve out time to read and talk about the book with anyone who would listen. Without reservation I can say that It May Be Forever is one of the best historical epic novels I've ever read. You don't have to like history to love this book - it will appeal if you like action or romance or if you enjoy the development of complex characters, who grow over time. In fact, there really is something for everyone here, even a little suspense, at least in keeping you on the edge of your seat. James Michener and Leon Uris, move over, and Oprah, take notice! David Quinn has arrived."
3,"Fun and works good, but a bit large for little hands","I guess I was expecting a kid's mouse to be smaller to fit a kid's hand. My 4 yr. old daughter loved using this, and it works well, but it is no smaller than my standard mouse-- so no easier for her to use. The only benefit to her is the Dora decoration. After several months of asking to plug it in when she uses the computer, she now prefers to use my standard wire-less unit, because the cord annoys her on the Dora mouse. Bottom line it was fun for a while, but ultimately a trinket that now sits in the drawer."
2,Not very happy with product,"I do not reccommend this for a smaller child (~3 - 4 years old). Although it claims it is made for smaller hands, it is not much smaller than a regular mouse and nowhere near as small as a wireless mouse (which is what I wish I had bought now). My daughter is average size and this does not fit in her hand very well. I feel like I wasted my [...]. Company's web-site is poorly organized as well. Even though the instructions say to go to the web-site for help, there is no help section on the web-site. There is no real product information (Specs, etc) available, just a bunch of stores they claim carry their products that don't."
3,They work...,Not the greatest quality...some actually came almost rusty and some you can hardly see the size engraving. The good thing about it is the completeness of the set for a decent price. They will work for my set of tools I take to the desert for sure...I wouldn't buy them for my garage set though. But I figured this going into it...you get what you pay for.
3,Casual Fans Point of View,Overall theres nothing wrong with this release however i wouldn't reccomend this for casual fans however i would reccomend other cds newer than the very best of(if u dont have that as a casual fan you will want it).Check out house of cards reminds me of worlds apart the band most popular release. Network which was harder than most of there other albums which i liked. I actually liked those 2 cds better than their very best of overall. Also worth mentioning is full circle the last half of that cd is very good the start is ok. In this casual fan's opinion the songs on those albums compare to and or beat alot of the songs on the very best of which by the way has there most well known hits in america and is all lots of casual fans will want. I bought all the cds i named however and enjoy them very much.
4,A little of something for every Saga fan,"This cd starts off with a solid track Marathon. The next really good song is breathing lessons( sort of a ballad). The first great track is Streets of Gold which is very much in the vein of the other chapter song( musiccally a really excellent song). The Blind side of my heart is another excellent ballad type song. You know I know is another chapter song which is excellent. Rise and Shine is the single and a good song a little different for a Saga song. Overall this cd is pretty heavy somewhat like full circle but different. The cd isn't perfect sometimes it get bogged down with lil friend sam voices like at the start of too deep(which gets better the farther you get into the song). It has some really good material on it, but also takes few listens to get used to the cd. It's heavier than other cd's but also has some softer material on it."
5,much better than I expected !,"I'm not quite sure why others have given this CD such bad reviews: this SAGA album is almost as good as ""House of Cards"", and is way better than ""Full Circle"" (which I find completely unlistenable). All but one or two tracks on this one are very good, I've found myself listening to it over and over in the car."
3,Doesn't meet expectations for Calphalon brand,"I expected a lot from the Calphalon brand name, and I am disappointed. I purchased this item with a number of other Calphalon tools to complement a set of Calphalon nonstick pots and pans. On all items, the gray accent pieces are not well integrated; they are separate pieces that have a nasty habit of falling out of tools' handles at inopportune times (into a hot pan, etc.). I would not purchase any other Calphalon tools based on this experience."
4,It's a cool movie,"What a cool movie. The movie centers around the duel-to-death between two skilful samurai with a little twist that one of them is an immortal demon god. A great mixture of swordfight and irreverent humor, this movie reminded me a lot of 'Samurai Fiction', which I also enjoyed. You won't be disappointed."
1,-BORING-,Nothing but dialogs (and the talks weren't all that interesting). Only so so action at the last 10 minutes of the film. Loved Azumi but haven't found another worth-while film by this director since. All boring supernatural crap. Giving up on this director!
4,Great American Personality Landscape,"A wonderful cadre of short stories, highlighting the day to day struggles of relationships caught with a keen eye and sharp wit. Especially enjoyable was the story of two college poets and the change of their relationship due to the nervous breakdown of one of them. A kinder Raymond Carver. Great read."
1,Nasty cups,"Don't order these! When i ordered these, I was so looking forward to some delcious Mallo cups. The ones I received were old, discolored, and looked they had been in a warehouse for years. I tried one, but it tasted as bad as it looked. I promptly tossed the whole shipment. What a waste! All was not lost, though. I read here that they were at Dollar Tree and I'm enjoying some good ones now as I write this review."
1,YUCK.,"Me and my girlfriend were eager to try these out as they had three foods we like: marshmallow, coconut, and chocolate.These candies somehow were able to disgust us. They tasted old and the marshmallow inside had the most vile consistency. To top it off, you could NOT even taste any of the coconut.Now i have a box of these nasty things sitting my drawer, I wouldn't even give these to my least liked friends. They are that terrible.These were truly a disappointment. I now know better to blindly trust the judgement of other shoppers of Amazon even when they all say the product is great.Just remember next time you see all the reviews on a product that are claiming its the best candy ever....caveat emptor."
3,Mallo Cups,I hadn't eaten a Mallo Cup in decades and thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the taste and some memories of my childhood. Although the cups that I received tasted good they were apparently seconds. The filling in virtually every cup had partially leaked out of them. I don't remember that in the ones that I had in the past.
5,mmm Mallo Cups,"Just like I remembered. The two boxes came without a problem, when they said it would and well packaged. The product was fresh and every last one was delicious! Would recomend this seller to everyone. I'm looking forward to my next purchase. Thanks again!"
4,Pixma 960 printer,"The printer functions well as a printer and copier. The printer can be used via bluetooth to print in another location, but I have been unable to achieve this with scanning which means I have to have the printer attached to the computer. This defeats the purpose for having purchased a bluetooth item."
5,Best printer ever owned,"Canon didn't skimp one iota on quality and performance when they designed this printer. Absolutely the best printer I've ever owned, and over the years I've owned many, including color lasers. This one heads the list, and I recommend it without reservation."
5,Excellent all around all in one,"Excellent photo printing, with the 7 colors the prints are outstanding.Very simple to operate, and its scanning capabilities far surpass any others I have used at home.I would highly recommend this printer to anyone who is serious about quality and detail in their prints"
3,Professional grade printer,"The results produced by this printer are excellent. Making a print from a color slide or a color negative is easy and produces surprisingly fine quality results. The ability to restore faded colors and other flexibility features is very impressive. Prints from memory card show great color accuracy and very fine detail. Disappointment is that modifying an image (such as lightening, darkening, increasing or decreasing contrast, etc.) can not be reviewed on LCD screen prior to printing."
3,The MP970 is Better in Several Ways,"I ordered this printer from Amazon but never actually used it. I read one review that said the MP960 printed pictures better than the MP970 and was slightly faster. That may be true, but the MP970 prints pictures extremely well and the difference in speed comes down to a few seconds. That said, the following sold me on the MP970:1) MP970 has built-in networking2) MP970 can read xD picture cards3) MP970 has on-board storage for 35mm negative holder4) MP970 has a smaller footprint than the MP960 (it is also not as tall)"
1,Weird colors,"After working for a year correctly, this printer went bonkers. This printer will not render photos with accurate colors, they all have a green tint. Even when you try to print in Black & White, it prints in black and pink. I tried looking into all troubleshooting, but to no avail. Will have to buy a new printer."
3,Good printer but...,This is my second MP960. The feed mechanism gave out on the first one after 13 months of home use. I purchased a second 960 because it copies 8 35MM slides at a time. It was inoperative right out of the box. As soon as it was powered up I got an error message and could not proceed. Called Canon's trouble line but wound up taking it to an authorized repair dealer 2 hours away from home. Not a happy camper but the printer is worth the effort.
1,Not a reliable product,"This printer did well for only a short time.It was a second printer and RARELY used to actually print anything. It was purchased to scan slides. The printer was expensive at $400.I had it only for a year plus when I got a error message that would not allow the printer to work (U052). I replaced all the ink tanks (this was the first time any of the ink tanks were replaced (very expensive) and still received the error that the printhead needed replacement. The printhead is $80-110. The printer will not do anything without this printhead being replaced.After looking online regarding the error it was evident that this was a design error, not only in the MP960 but other Canon printers.This printer is not recommended by me."
3,i love the songs!,"the songs are 5 stars but i have a windows phone and every time i buy an album fromamazon , it has to go to the cloud and then download it to my computer and transfer itto my windows phone. besides all the songs configurated like 4 different albums.i guess i you have android or apple is ok."
4,Essential Euro-Pop Masterpiece!,"Just on the strength of the Compositions themselves, this is an essential addition to the (Guilty Pleasure Dept) Music Library of any fan of Irresistible, Sugary, Big-Orchestra, Timeless Euro-Pop Masterpieces. Other reviews mentioned that the overall Audio Quality of this re-issue is somewhat Lack-Luster, and I guess I'll have to agree. For Best Listening Experience, hop in the Way-Back Machine, zip back to the 70's & listen to the original LPs in a Disco, played on a turn-table through wall-sized speakers, along with Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"" LP."
5,A classic,"All the best songs from the 70's supergroup ABBA. How can you go wrong? A great album and a lot of fun for anyone who likes the fun, cheesy and light music of ABBA."
5,Love it!,"For those Abba lovers this is great, it has most of their hits and quality wise is amazing.it also contains most Mamma mia songs"
3,I Enjoyed it,I bought this music from Abba to go along with Abba music from different artists. I discovered for my purposes... relaxation... the other version of Abba music works better.
1,BEWARE: Track 19 is CORRUPT and Amazon won't fix!,"Track 19 ""Waterloo"" is corrupt. The first part has been cut and it jumps when the song starts. I contacted Customer Service and found out that it's located in the Philipines (according to the tech); they couldn't understand what I was saying about it being corrupt and insisted that the download failed. Playing it on the Amazon Cloud Player results in the same problem. I insisted on speaking to a manager who said she would take care of it and with a an hour I received and email saying the problem was fixed. But the problem was not fixed as of this writing."
5,Best of the Best,ABBA is just about the greatest group ever and Gold has all their amazing hits. I am an old man and listening to Gold makes me want to get up and dance.
5,Best Series on Prime!,"If you're a Battlestar Galactica Fan, you'll love the new version. Several surprises, twists and turns in the plot that will keep you guessing. Watch all four seasons!"
1,Three ain't a charm,"Season three of Battlestar Galactica was just as the pundits panned it...a drag! I kept hoping that the next episode or next disc would wake my feet up, but in the end I just gave up and plugged in season one ""the mini series"" for relief. I also wanted to remember what the damn thing was all about again.I hope season four is ""back on course"", so to speak. Season three left me longing for the 1970s series (frightening as that might sound)."
2,Dreadful,"I enjoyed the hell out of the first two seasons. The were edgy, dark, and gritty. This season starts well and then degenerates quickly into the worst kind of maudlin, lip-biting soap opera you can imagine. Think: ""Feelings."" Thank God the writers spared Edward James Olmos most of the humiliation they visited on the other actors. After seeing this season, it's not hard to see why the show was canceled."
3,Not the same.,"I love this new series of Battlestar Galactica, but Season 3 is much more the soap opera than the preceding seasons. Prepare to learn about everyone's disfunctional relationships in most episodes, along with extended head trips within Baltar's psyche. This is not to say that there isn't any good action, but fewer and farther between than in previous seasons."
2,Not what I thought,"This only brings you up to the end of the season from the year before. So, it you want to know what is going on up to the end of last season, this won't do it."
1,Writers ruined it all.....,"Having been a fan a long time I was greatly disappointed with the direction this took. The actors all have the ability to perform great, the tchnology for awesome graphics exists as this show has proven but the writing just took this to the trash. This had some great potential but the writers just moved too far from the spirit of Battlestar Galactica. Too bad, maybe the next season can raise this from the dead. New writers anyone? I love sci-fi but man, is there anything those hollywood writers won't mess up?"
1,Poor quality recording and dirty DVDs,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this recording. The picture is grainy, several of the discs would not play until they were cleaned and one of the discs at the very end would only progress frame by frame. For being a ""new"" product I was surprised at how dirty the discs were and one of them was even oily. I suspect that this set of discs are cheap knock offs manufactured in someones garage and are not copies sanctioned by the producers of Battlestar Galactica."
4,"Great season, great series, dinged packaging :(","As with my season two set, this set arrived with some dings on the packaging. I would suggest that Amazon not package these sets in such small boxes when they ship."
3,Subtitling for Season 3?,"I already own the Season 3 Region 2 boxset and enjoyed it very much. I think in some ways it's my favourite season, and the courtroom scenes in 'Crossroads' held me absolutely riveted to my screen. But.... as we all know, the R2 sets are rather lacking - no special features at all, except the 'Story So Far' recap. As this is true across the board I'd ordered American versions of Seasons 1, 2.5 and 4.5 and was delighted with 1 and 4.5. 2.5 was a disappointment because none of the special features apart from the extended version of 'Pegasus' was subtitled. Before I buy Season 3, could someone tell me what the subtitling status is there? I know podcasts and commentaries won't be subtitled, and I don't expect them to be, but I *would* like subtitling for deleted scenes, featurettes, blogs and so on. Help?"
5,It does nto get better than this series,"Better than the original series BY A LONG SHOT. I have mixed feelings, I can not wait for the end but do not want it to end."
2,Soap Opera Galactica,"Battlestar Galactica started out as a military science fiction show (though its science is nonsense). In its second season it became a political drama. In its third season it became a soap opera with cheating spouses, a ménage à trois, emoting Cylons, sex scenes and many shots of nearly nude hunks, dream sequences, imaginary lovers, etc. I assume that the producers and writers decided to abandon the original fans (mostly males who liked action stories) and appeal to soap opera-loving females.Of note is that the genre changes of Battlestar Galactica failed. Viewership declined throughout the second season and declined more rapidly during the third season. The show's Nielson ratings averaged 2.3 in season 1, 1.9 in season 2, and 1.4 in season 3.If you were a fan of the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica, I recommend that you rent DVD 1 of season three to see if it appeals to you."
4,Battlestar Galactica - Season Three,"I enjoyed season three but not as much as season 1 and two. It seemed to be a little ""darker"" and a little more hopeless. I was frustrated with the actions of some of the characters. They made choices or did things that made no sense. It seemed that their actions were more of an attempt to create an interesting story or plot twist."
5,It might not be so bad to be a Cylon,A superior remake with all the needed bells and whistles of the new milinenium. This is truly a more believable Sci fi creation. The drama is engaging and manages to explore human dynamics from unusual directions. Season 3 continues and deepens the story arc. I can't wait until season 4's dvd's are released.
3,"Great, little random at times",Season 3 is Not as great as the first two seasons. A little random at times. I wished they sticked the story more.
4,Incredible start of the season ....then ......down it went,Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4.
2,Battlestar Galactica,"We like this show, but not all the sex. No plot to it. We don't care about Baltar's sex life or any others. They spend way too much time showing this. If they would make the story more about the journey, and the fight against the cylons, it would improve the series. We loved it when the producers brought in the 2nd Battlestar, but hated the fighting between the commanders. They should bring back a 2nd Battlestar and this time, have them work together to save the fleet. If these writers' would focus more on this instead, they could really bring the show back. As it is, it seems like it is going to tank if the writers do not stop doing all the useless sex and more on a real story. Developing the stealth craft was great, it gave them an edge on the cylons. We stopped watching the show for these reasons, it is getting boring! Sorry. Wonderful job, however, on the graphics. Beautiful photography. Actors and Actresses do a terrific performance.Battlestar Galactica - Season Three"
3,Disjointed & All Over The Place...,"I'm arriving a little late to this party... had started watching the re-imagined series when it started on the Sci-Fi channel, but lost track. Over the past year I have started to pick back up from where I left off and I am not pleased. While I love the concept of the new Battlestar Galactica, loved the earlier character development and the backdrop, I found the end of season 2.5 and the entire 3rd season to literaly be all over the place and disjointed. The careful crafting of a story so elquently done in both the pilot episode and season 1 are no where to be found towards the end of season 2.5 or 3. As the show has progressed it has become a very simply written, spiritual, religious mess and the characters are not as cohesively developed as they once were. The writers must have changed. I've got a bad feeling about season 4...Not total trash, but certainly not what the pilot episode or season 1 were. Such a shame!"
5,A not to be missed series!!!,"Simply put this is the best Sci-Fi show ever written, possibly TV show ever. The story continues as the rag tag fleet desperately tries to hide and evade the tricky cylons and discovering that once allies and friends just might not be. Great story lines and not the typical boring hollywood writing makes this a terrific buy. The ensemble of complex characters also makes the show. Edward J. olmos is superb in everything he does and this is no exception.I have this season up there with 2 and 2.5. A really good friend turned me to this show and I am glad he did. I don't want to give any ""frackin"" spoilers away so if you have a few weekends to invest I highly recommend this season."
4,Getting better and better,Galactica keeps on rolling with season 3. Another great season. Story lines that never get old and action that's always intense.
5,"JUST A BSG FREAK, I LOVE EM","ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I EVER WATCHED EVERY WEEK. GLAD TO SEE IT END, HATE TO SEE IT GO"
3,WHY?,"I never bought this item so why is it appearing on this list, please let me know the answer ok??"
2,The reason Season 3 was terrible. . .,"The producers strayed from the formula that made BSG the best show on television. This season is NOT worth buying. Save yourself the hours and read some internet sites for a few minutes.BSG 1 was one of the best seasons on television I'd seen in a long time. BSG season 2 and 2.5 were equally gripping and held high some cinematic excellence. Season 3 was a tremendous disappointment and letdown. My wife will no longer watch. It has become a scifi soap opera. They showed Vipers exit the launch tubes a handfull of times, and focused on everyones relationships.Character development is one thing, but completely changing the face of the show and moving away from the action was a season killer for me."
2,A bit racey...,I haven't seen Battlestar Galactica since 4th grade or so. My goodness how they've grown in parts and places and such. This ain't your father's Battlestar I'll tell you that. I tried to watch the whole thing but just couldn't get over the frat like need for busts and such. I wanted sci-fi. Not sci-fi meets Sports Illustrative Swimsuit issue because our story line need some spice (or better writing). Anyhow... I'm glad this one was free.
3,"All War all the time, or Sleazy sex","I've read the reviews, almost all of them. Few of them seem to have anything to do with the writing, directing or production.They seem to be pointed at plots that suit a predilection.Even mine, come to think of it. My predilection being for reason and relationships.The third season reaches for thought and nobility, though the first two did also. The third season rises above producers' ""war and sex"", without abandoning the importance of either.The questions raised in the third season are exquisite. Painful. And important. The single thing this series does magnificently is raise questions. Even early on.I count the third season as the very best, but acknowledge my dislike of war and sexual violence (humiliation) may be biasing me.The writing has been supurb throughout.Though I also notice: Joss Whedon made us laugh at ourselves.BSG doesn't.Mulholland"
5,Finally a series worth watching,"Even in the advance times of knowledge, there are problems with human nature, ego, pride, and prejudice. Series is worth watching if for no other reason that it makes you think and wonder if the answer truly can only be found within our selves...."
5,Battlestar Galactica -Season 3- a must have!,This is a wonderful set for those who missed part or all of Season 3 and for those who wish to review the past or just watch it again. Good price!
5,Very Entertaining!,Got this as a gift for my husband and he really enjoyed it. He can't wait for season 4 to come out!
2,"Interesting topic, but annoying music, not a lot of likeable characters","Interesting topic, but annoying music, not a lot of likeable characters. They got ahead of themselves trying tobe original by going in and out of different conscious states. Few have the talent to pull off artsy and creators of thisshow couldn't do it."
2,Just like season 2.5,"Season 2.5 ended on such a great cliffhanger. That's why when you see the first episode of this season, you feal let down. As with most of this season. The good episodes were ""Precipice"", ""Exodus, Part II"", ""A Measure of Salvation"", ""The Eye of Jupiter"", and ""Rapture"". But out of 20 episodes that's not good. Even the last episode ""Crossraods"" was disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it had a great cliffhanger ending, but the episode itself was crap. Unless you bought season 2.5, don't buy this one. It's crap!"
4,Review from a real fan,"I consider myself a diehard fan of the series because I love the storylines, the way the actors bring the characters to life and the minimalist approach to the special effects. All that being said why are there only 2 or 3 episodes to each disc? My only complaint is with the packaging and formatting of the discs, which in my opinion could have and should have been done in a minimalist package. The show remains ""the best show on television today""."
3,Rons,You have to be a fan of Battlestar Galactica to enjoy this set. It is very good and I would recomend this to anyone that likes sifi.
4,Good Season,More of the same plot twists and high drama - all of which is as riveting as usual and keeps your interest up. Just wish there was more shooting the robots!
4,Darker than the rest,"Season 3 of the new Battlestar Galactica is, if anything, even darker than the rest of the series. And this in a series that reduces the entire known human population (except for us pesky Earthlings) to less than 60,000 in the first episode of the show!Well acted, especially at the ends of the season, BSG continues to shine in Season 3. The middle gets a little heavy, too much emotional baggage for some. But, it can't be All Starship Combat, All the Time! The characters, even those who are Cylons, are flawed, human, and very relatable.Well worth the time to sit through it all ... and the bonus features are, as always, very interesting."
3,Eh. It's okay.,"Personally, I didn't like this season as well as the first two. It was ""good"" but the episodes just didn't have that ""I have to see the next episode NOW!"" thing going on that the previous seasons had.The first two season's set the bar very high, and this one just didn't match up. Here's hopeing that season 4 can return the series to it's former glory.(To be fair, I would like to state that I have not yet watched the final disk. So on one hand, I do not have a full view of the entire season. On the other hand, I haven't been inspired to watch the final disk.)"
2,The boxing was good,"This episode could have, should have been a 5 star. It's a refreshing break from the ever-present cylon threat.However...Kara's a frak-up. Lee's an insufferable twit. Their character flaws serve as the basis for the majority of the side-plot turned main plot, and it's about as annoying as they can make it. The pace and frequency of flashbacks is jarring and pointless, and the fact that these character flaws (the same ones, again and again) are driven to the point of inanity. There's no telling if this will affect the series' overarching plot, because this episode is nothing but highschool drama.That's right, I said it- highschool drama. This series deserved better."
4,Would be better if they included season three,"Nice recap of the first two seasons of BSG. I thought, since this retrospective was produced last year, that it would include season three episodes in anticipation of the new season premiering in April '08, but it didn't. Otherwise an excellent recap of events leading up to season three."
2,Bleh.,"This book is cheesy. You'll learn more from ""Light: Science & Magic"" and looking at photos to see what you like, then trying to reconstruct that lighting with the skills you learn in LS&M."
4,Very Good Guide,"I found this to be a very good guide on the subject of lighting and exposure for location photography. The sections on lighting were certainly the highlight of this book. The author goes into great detail to explain the concepts of light modification and subtracting light which is rarely discussed in other books. The photos are well done and lit properly. My only negative was that some of the poses looked a little forced, which is why I rated the book 4 stars and not 5. Overall, it is a very good book."
5,Great Book!,"I've used my copy of this book for nearly 20 years, and finally ""used it up."" Had to get myself another copy. Well worth it, for those of us who still use our pressure cookers and enjoy them. Good recipes, excellent instructions and good pictures -- what more do you need? Enjoy!"
3,Ana Fin Stats,"Rob gives simple, yet solid information. He writes to his TV viewers, and doesn't talk down to those who know less. He also gives a very good overview that is paramount for all, regardless of financial knowledge. If he could find an angle, he could be the next Suze or Jimbo, yet after reading his book I find him to be a Teacher more than a...hypster. He stays true to who he is and gives readers a book that is good, solid financial information."
1,Simple and contrived,Basic money management book that could have been cut and pasted from hundreds of other below average money management books. Typical Rob Black looking to make a quick buck and good for him because he could never do it by picking stocks.
1,too basic,basic info..nothing special boring. Hundreds of book about investments out there that are much better.
5,Excellent Single,"The single is truly enjoyable; ""Undecided"" is an excellent remake by the band (don't be fooled it is not the song found on frogstomp). At first I was thrown off by the idea of a techno remix of ""Freak"", but I enjoy the song. Great single for a bright, happy day."
5,The other side of a legendary flying ace!,"Although areas of the general's military service are mentioned in this incredible story, the main focus is on Yeager's journeys into remote country regions. Most memorable are his jaunts with close friends and family members into the eastern Sierras of California. Yeager writes and recalls these stories in a captivating style that makes you feel like your right there on the trail. From catching and eating golden trout to walking miles of wilderness areas seeing sites rarely traveled by others, the reader gets the sense of what it was like to experience the true virtues of our unspoiled wilds. General Yeager is a true naturalist and this book is a great offering of the existential side of a great American hero."
3,Pat Toomay is a Pro,"This is a pretty good and forgotten book. If you are a Dallas Cowboys fan you will probably like this book. Toomay tells his story from getting drafted and going to training camp, all the things that happen there and what it was like to play for the Cowboys back in the day. Pat is a good writer and I liked hearing his story."
3,Taxi Squad Publisher,"While the content is interesting and amusing, the quality of the paperback is sub-par. This edition is a reprint by a reprint publishing house, and it appears that corners were cut. The photos that appear in the book, for example, are grainy and of such poor quality that it's difficult to recognize the players. It's very disappointing to have paid $16.95 for such poor workmanship. The publisher won't make any publishing Hall of Fame!"
5,Great Bible for personal study,"I have a number of Bibles at home, and I like this one. I am Catholic and my priest pointed out the Old Testament books that are included in this one that are excluded from some other Translations: Tobit, Judith, 1 & 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach and Baruch.Also the introductions of each book set the context of the writing. And then there are all sorts of group and personal study questions about the various readings that give you things to think about. Ideas to contemplate.Joyful studying."
3,"A fitting ending to ""The Postcard""","Although The Postcard and this book, The Crossing do not come close to the interest Beverly Lewis drew in her 3 book series, Shunning, Confession and Reckoning, this book was good enough to hold my interest and a fitting conclusion to the Postcard. It seemed shallow compared to the other 3 books, and had a very predictable outcome. I do hope Beverly will write more of the quality found in the Shunning series. END"
3,A great way to wrap up a story,"THis is the perfect conclusion to ""The Postcard"" mainly because it wraps everything up so well. There's no major drama, or mystery, like the first one. Rachel is intent on overcoming her blindness by faith, not by a powwow doctor. Philip has come to realize that there is something missing in his big-city life.The title refers to the crossroad Philip must face in making his decision, and to the physical crossroad Rachel must face in order to move beyond her accident of a few years ago.This is a moving tale with a great ending...enjoy!"
5,a good Amish book.,I have always enjoyed Beverly Lewis' books about the Amish and I was not disappointed in this one. It was interesting reading.
4,Good Book on Spanish,I really liked this book. I was able to speak a little Spanish and understand it within the first week of reading this book.I recommend it to anyone who wants or needs a quick course on learning enough Spanish to get buy.
2,Too contrived,Some of the associations seemed contrived and it was not easy to follow the logic used.Sometimes the association was too lengthy to see the connection... used it with some of the words but not for most.
3,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. It does help people to learn more vocabulary, but I already knew what it presents. I thought it was presenting more complex ideas and vocabulary. However, there are very good associations to help learn more Spanish vocabulary. I would not recommend for someone who has more extensive knowledge of Spanish."
2,Not impressed - limited scope,"Spanish is the 4th language I'm trying to learn, and my past experiences demonstrated how associations play a major part in a process of building vocabulary. I could hardly wait to get this book hoping it would help me build the bridge.As soon as I scanned through the book, my excitement vanished.This book offers associations for a very limited list of words. Granted, most of the examples are useful, but the overall number of words offered is hardly more than 200. Add to it errors on 2-3 pages where mini test included words that were nowhere on the list.The only useful long-term venue of using this book that I can think of is to take it as a starting point of building associations/connections with foreign words. But even in this case, the book lacks common principles that would assist with such expansion."
4,Need to learn Spanish vocabulary? Here is a different approach!,"As a teacher of Spanish this book will assist you in presenting a different approach on how to remembervocabulary. It is by ""Association."" Many books talk about association but don't tell you ""how to do it."" This book does. It also provides exercises to help a student get with the program. It is a good start and the author's system needs to be refined. It is a step in the right direction."
5,Have Fun & Learn Spanish,"I used this book when I started getting back into learning Spanish. It was an entertaining book to read through and I completed it in a weekend. Don't expect too much from this book. You will learn some vocabulary and a little grammar but not nearly enough to be a stand alone text (it is not intended to be). Buy it, have fun with it, and learn some Spanish, all in a weekend."
4,Great for Beginners,This book is amazing for learning basic vocabulary and grammar. You'll go through most beginners classes in 10 hours. This book is for those who want to know the language not for those needing to know some words for the weekend. Read it world for word to get best results.This book has some flaws with it.1) Some of the associations are not good.2) It gives you the vocab words and on the next page ask you to translate spanish to english but WARNING answer is on next page with english to spanish exercise.
3,easy understanding,"This is an easy understanding book even if you are a layman. But it's easy to access the same information in the internet now so whether it's necessary to buy this book is up to you.The information in this book is useful but it's repetitive in all the chapters. So, actually you don't get too much out of the book. So many blank pages in this book and u just need an hour to finish it!anyway, the contribution of Dr Browntein is appreciated. We should thank him for reminding us that iodine is indeed a very important mineral for us!"
3,Not sure what I did wrong....,"I bought this book and iodine after extensive internet research after being diagnosed with Hypothyroidism 2 months ago. In a matter of 2 months my TSH level went from 18 all the way up to 72, so I am not sure what I did wrong. Just be very careful and have your Thyroid very closely monitored if you try this. I may have not done it right. I found the book did not explain very well at all how much Iodine I should be using daily. Nor did the bottle..... so I was putting 1 or 2 drops in a glass of water every morning. After reading the book, I still had to go on the internet and try to calculate exactly what I should be using. Maybe I just did it wrong, but the book should have been more forthright about telling you how much to use."
1,Can buy book for $15 on Dr. Brownstein website (just google),"You can purchase the book for $15 on Dr. Brownstein's website and you can get the iodine for $10.99 or so. It makes me angry seeing what opportunists are charging people that are scared and needing this treatment at this time. By the way, the book IS a 5 star buy!!!"
2,low value reference book at best!,"I would agree that the intended audience for this book is confusing. The first 2 chapters are very basic chapters about Java and Database, yet unless I knew about them, why would I be looking for a JDBC book.The book reads like a poorly written technical manual. I would recommend it only if you have several other books on JDBC and can afford to spend $32 for the examples in the back of the book..... A very poor read."
2,Don't Bother!,"Unfortunately very poorly organized and highly repetitive. By continually repeating already learned steps, the author makes a straightforward subject appear needlessly complex.Full of descriptions like:""'String DriverPropertyInfo.name' -- This is the name of the property.""It's one thing to be a great programmer, entirely different to be a teacher, able to present concepts in a clear, concise, and well-organized manner. You can learn JDBC from this book, but you'll have to fight the writing to do so.It's unclear who the book's target audience is, since much is presented too simply for the experienced, but much is too difficult for the novice. It even includes introductory sections ""About Java"" and ""Database Fundamentals"". I wouldn't want to attempt this book without being thoroughly versed in both.It's even difficult to use as a reference since the sections aren't clearly separated and it's hard to go back and find anything.I really wanted to like this book. I really can't."
5,Excellent Book about the Alcoholics Anonymous Program,Hats off to the Bobgans! This is an excellent book about the spiritual perils of the 12 step program as compared to Biblical Christianity. A must read for Christians involved in the program or contemplating joining AA.
4,Great set!,My 4 1/2 year old has loved everything having to do with space since he realized there were moon and stars in the sky. He recently watched Apollo 13 (the edited IMAX version) and LOVED it. This toy really brought to life what was going on. He plays with it for hours. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the Saturn rocket's 3 stages don't fit as tightly as they probably could and so even after a few weeks it began to be wobbly and won't stay together unless setting on a hard surface. The other pieces are just fine.
2,be careful,"The product is not as described (as of March 2009). The product description stated that the rocket was die-cast and detachable into separate parts. In the playset we received, the rocket was single piece of hard rubber.After we called to complain, our vendor explained that the manufacturer changed the product specs and they promptly refunded some of the purchase price. [...]Hopefully they will update the product description to include the rubber rocket..."
2,Saturn V Rocket,"We purchased this rocket for a science project for our son. It did not say when we ordered it what the size was. He was unable to use it because it was too small. I would suggest the size be put on line so you can determine whether to purchase it or not. We would not have purchased this rocket if we had known it was only 10"" long. It appears larger on line than it is in your hands. It is still sitting in the box. We may give it to our grandson for a Christmas present."
5,--ON BODY LANGUAGE,"I am a licensed clinical social worker, and I teach Communication Skills....I find this helpful for my lay clients, as it is written very simply language, recommend to young adults, as an adjunct to Communication Skills Training....Recommend--"
5,A symbol of salvation for metal...,"I never really paid much attention to Armored Saint during their heyday in the early 1980's. The band's first album in 9 years,""Revelation"" is an apt title. It's revealed to me what I've been missing all this time. This album manages to fuse together the brutality and DIY ethics of early punk combined with the melodic and competent sounds of progressive and thrash metal. Songs such as ""The Pillar"" and ""After Me, The Flood"" are standout tracks. The band have the right idea in sticking with the basics. All brutal. All mighty. All metal. All Saint...."
1,Don't waste your money on this CD!,"I was so disappointed by the low quality of these Vangelis renditions, especially with the dance music style pieces that completely miss the true essence of Vangelis.The Chariots of Fire version was downright terrible. The production values for tracks were sorely missed.Buy the real thing - Vangelis is a musical genius who obviously cannot be imitated without severe injustice to his work."
1,This is a tribute?!,"I'm so glad I only borrowed this album. Just awful, poor orchestration, poor sound quality. just dreadful. Buy the originals"
2,"5/8"" harmony ball","I liked the appearance of the pendent, however the the chime was more of a rattle. I had ordered the larger one also, and enjoy the mellow chiming sound."
2,Rattle,"This pendant is simple and elegant. The size is perfect for a petite woman like me. However, I agree with a previous reviewer--the chime is more like a rattle. My friend has a harmony ball necklace that sounds angelic when she shakes it so I wanted one as well. I was really disappointed with the rattling sound of the 3 or so noisemakers inside the pendant. I would say it sounds more like a sleigh bell than a harmony ball. I'm too lazy to send it back too so I guess this pendant will make a good holiday rattle for the upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas festivities..."
4,A Good Companion to the Box Set,"You'll find several tracks on this CD that are NOT on any USA-released CD, including the studio version of ""Cross My Heart"" and some cuts from the notorious ""Gunfight at Carnegie Hall"" shows. The two tracks that were recorded in South Africa are rather enjoyable, too, and one wonders if Ochs' folk compatriot, Paul Simon, was influenced by them (Ochs recorded them more than a decade before Simon's ""Graceland"").One gripe--the sound quality is OK, but it's patently inferior to the USA CDs, including the box set."
5,Reference to over one hundred food companies,"Texas Food Companies: A Tasty Guide by Texas author Rhonda Cloos is a unique and impressive, encyclopedia-style reference to over one hundred food companies located within the confines of the Lone Star State. Each entry contains a brief history of the company, information on food factory tours, and buying and ordering information in order to get hold of company foodstuffs. A web guide to ordering favorite foods online make the mouth-watering ingredients listed in Texas Food Companies effectively available to all. Whether as a specialized travel guide reference for visitors or for gourmet cooks seeking direct order ingredients for Texas ethnic cuisines, Texas Food Companies is a welcome and highly recommended reference."
1,"An editor, my kingdom for an editor...","The Exam Cram and Exam Cram 2 series are excellent sources for the information you need to pass your exams. THIS book has all of the relevant information that you will need to pass the exam. However, it's the worst laid out book I have ever seen. While it tried to conform to the usual format of the Exam Cram series. It fails in one very important aspect. The editing is nearly non-existent. The book covers a topic in one paragraph and then turns around and goes over the exact same subject again 2 paragraphs later. It looks to me as though when it was updated from the older version of the exam things were added and nothing was removed. Any editor looking at this book would have a kitten. As I have explained it to some of my friends, ""they have problem repeating their repetition problem."""
2,Exam Cram not up to usual standards,"I have taken and passed 9 Microsoft and CompTIA certification exams. My usual method is to read 2-3 books, followed by an Exam Cram and a Transcender practice test. It seems to me that the author does not do an adequate job of explaining some of the objectives and for others, goes into extraneous detail that's downright confusing. Since I have not taken the exam yet, I can't verify my impression. Unfortunately, there are only 2 books available that include the 2005 updated objectives for CompTIA Server+ and this is one of them. I have been happy with the previous Exam Cram titles I have purchased."
3,Not quite what you need to pass the exam...,"This book did NOT APPLY AT ALL to the actual test that I just took a few hours ago. I was lucky to get a 660 (out of the 615) required to pass but I had to use educated guesses on a bunch of them.Please use this and maybe some other source but at 700 pages long, i would have expected more. The 2 sample tests in the book and the one included on the CD are not even close to being compatible. This should be used just as a cram book-even the quick cram sheet inside the book to look at pre-test didn't really give me much information.I'm severely disappointed and I've been in the workplace for 5+ years and worked extensively with servers for at leat 3 of those."
3,Not very resostant,"Resostant to WHICH chemicals exactly ? Definitely not solvents like Acetone and paint thinners. Lasted a few sprays and the pump mechanism dissolved. Bottles that hold up and sprayers shouldb be matched by type of chemicals they resist. Want real solvent/oil ? Buy sprayers from ZEP. Or buy super expensive lab sprayers, or PTFE (good luck finding a PTFE sprayer) or find a metal one with Buna seals but don't use acid or bases in those.Wait, you could use a gold plated sprayer , right ? For the guy who has everything but atill likes to work with tools.I'm going to try a hand pumped lawn chemical sprayer with a metal wand."

2,Not what I thought,The blanket is not at all what I thought I was buying! I'm not happy with it. My daughter who loves Dora is. It's very flimsy and thin. I wanted a thicker one.
4,Dora Blanket,"Daughter loves this. Of course, she's a real ""Dora"" fan, so hat isn't to love about this blanket?!"
2,Not as good as I thought,"Thin, strong color blanket, not as good as I had thought, you could buy at this price, or even cheaper in local store. Not impressive. Very so-so."
5,found this at a thrift store,My son is three and LOVES this book. We read it several times a week. Its very durable and hasn't ripped yet!
5,"Finally, the answer to the question of why God allows evil.","This is the answer to the question, ""Why does a good God allow evil in his world?"" Adams uses scripture to explain the hard reality of evil, and God's power over it. Why He created the devil and demons, why He allows sin, and how God uses it for His glory, and to demonstrate his character. A truly great book! It is a very small book but powerful. You will be glad you read it."
5,The Best of Times: The Best of Styx,Received product in a timely manner. Was in excellent shape. And am enjoying the CD.
2,Scorched hair.,"I got this dryer about a year ago loved it. It dried my super thick hair quickly and made it very shiny. Now that I've been using it for a year I have noticed that it's scorching my hair. The ends of my hair will are very damaged and won't take my hair's natural curl pattern anymore. I've been drying and styling my hair for over almost 2 decades and have never ever had this happen to my hair. I can only attribute the problem to the dryer as my hair never did this with my old dryer. Unfortunately the medium heat setting isn't nearly hot enough and it takes forever to dry my hair. I'm just going to replace it. I use heat protecting products by the way. So those that have it or get it, just be careful of the very high heat."
2,May not be what you want,"While the keyset is probably exactly what you are looking for, you should be aware that this is NOT a keyboard. It is a keyboard cover for a specific Zboard keyboard. The pictures were not adequate for me to initially make this decision. I had to return this item or purchase the $30 keyboard as well. If this is not what you are looking for, you might be interested instead in a FangPad or CyberSnipa USB plug in. I ended up returning this and getting the CyberSnipa USB (V1, there is a V2 with more keys) Keypad which required no overlay and was $22 for the entire setup."

1,THIS KEYSET IS NOT SUPPORTED!!!!!,"dont get suckered into it just yet, ive had mine for over a week and its still usless, zboard hasnt even updated their software yet, this board does not get recognized with the current sofwtare, its useless. unless you see new drivers with a date other than aug 12 on the zboard site do not buy. wait for them to update drivers unless you want a paperweight"
3,a little boring,"actually 3,5 stars. this one of the releases that keeps up the same pace throughout whole cd. nevertheless, the tracks are good and so is the mixing."
4,Breakbeats best continues to impress.,"This came as no surprise considering the sucess of the Y_k series. Dj Layo does a supurb job at mixing the current stars in this genra together for this third instalment of breakbeat elite. No weak tracks here, however the mix's energy level could have been improved if there were a couple more vocal tracks like the first kicker. Would have liked a second disk to round up the set a little better. Overall good work. Bushwaka is said be the next DJ we'll see come down avenue Y_k."
4,another great single,if you enjoy Delerium then this cd will not disappoint. the only negative (and this applies to the industry) is that there are only 3 tracks on the cd forcing you to purchase CD2 to get the complete set.
5,"Wonderful, informaitive, Truthful","This book gives a truthful picture of APBT's. It also has exclent information on caring for this breed through it's life. I purchased it for my mother, who was nervous about the breed, before I adopted my dog. After reading the book she was looking forward to having the adition to the family come and was sharing her new found info with friends and family who had negitive reactions when hearing I was getting an APBT. An exclent book to have on hand and share with those intrested in the breed, who own the breed, and who don't know the breed."
2,Not that great,"Understandably, this book is written specifically for individuals looking for a pure-bred APBT. The author does a fair and objective job describing the misunderstood history of the dog. Less understandably, the book is riddled with grammatical errors and typos. Needless to say, I was surprised when the pages were actually out of order.Conceptually, the author's heart is in the right place, but he asks questions and gives no answer. Points become repetitive and appear in multiple sections of the book (same with the pictures), and become a bore to read.All in all, the book should have been proofread, both by the publisher and an APBT expert."
4,Easy read for those who want to know more about the breed.,"This book was helpful when I first got my APT a few years back. Besides teaching you the basics of taking care of him/her, it also goes into how the breed has been abused and misinterpreted. American Pitbull Terriers can be the most loyal and friendliest of dogs, if taken care of properly. (I can attest to that, being a former owner)."
4,gift book,"This product was a gift, and I have no first hand contact with it. Nevertheless, its recipient informed he of his complete satisfaction with its delivery and contents. I can rate it only less than perfect for the simple reason that I lack any first hand experience with the item I purchased for someone else. In no way is this rating intended to convey any dissatisfaction with the book whatsoever."
1,Very Basic,"This book contains very basic information. I purchased this book after adopting my puppy and found it discussed the stereotype more than anything else. I would recommend it for people that know very little about the breed and its history, otherwise find another book."
5,Pure 90s r&b,I've been an appreciator of the 90s r&b; vibe for a while. This album is the epythomy of that sound.True gems and true floor fillers and grooves you will find in this magnificent album.Her voice is incredible and the beats are amazing.If you like the genre then THIS is the album to have .
1,I spent $25.00 on this!!,"This was a huge waste of money. I heard one of the songs on a tape at The Gap, so I looked everywhere for a single of the song, because I hate buying albums. This is the reason I hate buying albums - you spend $20 on something, and you only like one song on the whole thing. ""Something In The Way You Make Me Feel"" is an awesome song. The rest of this stuff belongs in the trash."
5,long overdue - a must read for educators,"Long overview, this comprehensive description of an effective proven teaching approach warrants the attention of all interested in education today - authored by one of Canada's most experienced teachers of Direct Instruction."
5,Also see Siegfried Engelmann for Direct Instruction program and fight,"Anyone who is interested in Maloney should also look up all the books and research done by Siegfried Engelmann. Siegfried Engelmann is the creator of Direct Instruction and DISTAR which performed better than any other program.These are other books that I have found on amazon.com and in the public library system ...Give Your Child a Superior Mind: A Program for the Preschool Child,War Against Schools: Academic Child Abuse,Preventing Failure in the Primary Grades,Theory of Instruction: Principles and Applications,Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy LessonsTeach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons,Teaching Needy Kids in Our Backward System, Follow Through Evaluation,Your Child Can Can Succeed!,and other books that I have found on amazon.com and in the public library system ...also see [...]and Direct Instruction information"
3,OK,"For the price this is just OK. What you get is somewhat disappointing. The assortment is pretty muchsample-sized with just 1-2 pieces of each item described. You do get a small bag of chocolate covered pretzels, carmel corn, and cookies. Unfortunately, the laregest amount you get of something is the hardtack strawberry / butterscotch candies which fills one box and honestly doesnt justify the price. The boxes are very nice though and could be reused for future gifts. Overall it would be okay at about half the price but I think I would chooseanother company's assortment in the future."
2,"big boxes, little inside",big beautiful boxes with hardly any product inside. each carton contained mostly filling with very little product on top. i PAID for the name. will NEVER purchase again.
2,Not as pictured and slow to ship out,"I sent these as gifts to mom and grandmother. My mother called to tell me what was in the basket and how late it was received. She told me that she felt bad, but wanted me to know considering what was paid. The items were tasty though, according to her. The items seemed shorted as to what was pictured. I've ordered baskets before, from two other companies on Amazon, and got much better reviews from the recipients, including mom. Broadway seems much better."
3,Not worth the expense,"Our son shipped this gift for Fathers Day, it was ordered in time, but definitely not received on time. Three days late. The amount of goodies for the price is not in line in our opinion. Folks are trying to buy a gift when they can't think of something, and the receiver won't usually tell the gifter it was not worth the price and this cycle continues."
4,don't be surprised,This is really a very lovely towel ring -- nice finish and not at all flimsy. It extends from the wall farther than I had expected so don't be surprised.
5,Towel holder,This towel holder ring was purchased to match other accessories for our new bathroom. It looks and IS beautiful and does the job. The ORB finish is different than other oil rubbed bronze fixtures - more of a glow/shine vs. the dark black. Many compliments coming our way.
5,Great product!,"Great product! When I ordered this item I was not sure if it would helped, wow it did I lost 10lbs so far I'm looking to loose 55lbs more. Thank you"
3,not so funny,"I searched for a funny book for my husband. We are both from the UK originally, and enjoy talking with our friends about the differences. The reviews on this book maybe raised my expectations too high, as I was somewhat dissapointed when I read some of it. My husband has a great sense of humour, and I know he will enjoy it, but it is not a laugh out loud book really."
4,Insightful,"There were a few words I didn't find in the book that I'd already heard, but other than that... I'd have to say add it to your collection. It's a bit small, still the vocab is worth reading. Reading this you'll gain some insight that will make you drop your mouth open at some point."
2,Bad Book,"Totally stupid the way the book is laid out. Impossible to find any specific references unless willing to read the entire book , which will quickly bore you. I bought it for reference material for British movies and found it to be worthless."
4,Not for just the ol' blue rinsers ...,"A very well compiled and concise collection of British slang and colloquial expressions that seemingly date back two hundred years. However a good fifty percent are more common to the last forty years and probably another thirty percent are the last fifteen to a close ten. While this tome might be devoid of the more obscure statements like: ""Jimmy Hill"", no one's going to notice or fault the compilers for it.This is a good writers reference for anyone on the island or across the pond. Anyone interested in seeking other quality slang reference books can look here:1.The Unabridged Devil's Dictionary2.The Oxford Dictionary of Idioms3.Urban Dictionary: Street Slang Defined4.Depraved and Insulting English5.The Highly Selective Dictionary For The Extraordinarily Literate6.The Oxford Dictionary of Allusions7.How Not To Say What You Mean: A Dictionary of EuphemismsGot that, Gaffer? Cheers, me old son!"
4,"How to speak ""English"" for Americans!","Knickers in a Twist: A Dictionary of British SlangAlthough some of the phrases mentioned in the book are widely used in the USA, it still is a very interesting and educational book for the about-to- be tourist, or just English movie fan. I know I found out what ""bobby dazzler"" means."
2,Could be great,"I've been using these speakers for about 2 weeks and haven't been impressed at all. It seemed like they were ok at first, but I periodically lose the signal to one of the speakers every few seconds or so. I've tried everything to resolve this by the way, taking out the batteries and plugging them into the power cord, even carrying them into the house, near the transmitter, adjusting the volume on the source. Not sure if cell phones are causing the interference but I'll probably return them soon."
3,Is Martha a flake?,"Being an open-minded yet logical sort, I read about Martha's strange spiritual experiences with some skeptiscm but an understanding that perhaps I do not know everything - perhaps it is all true, I have no idea. The only person I've ever known to have paranormal experiences happens to be mentally ill. At any rate, it's her story and not mine. What can I take from it? I thought for a Harvard trained accomplished person (and I did get a bit tired reading about how very hard they all worked), she sure let her little girl watch alot of TV. I'm left wondering could Harvard truly be so cold? Why does Martha get visits from the angels? Why does Martha have a death wish? I've never experienced it, but a hug from God or whatever it was - is it really so great it makes you not want to live here with your family, even your angel son? If this was someone I knew, I'd recommend some psychiatric counseling."
2,Deeply disliked this book,"I had two pregnancies (and babies) as a graduate student at a prestigious institution and I'm also quite familiar with the culture at Harvard. Granted this was recently and not a decade or so ago, but her portrayal of Harvard's culture is ridiculous and frankly offensive. I'm so tired of our society's anti-intellectualism and this just feeds it. My experience of graduate school is indeed stressful, but very supportive and my deans, professors, and advisor have been truly patient with my progress and doting on my babies.This book just seemed over-the-top contrived and emotionally manipulative. I was given it as a gift and was unable to be genuinely greatful to the giver once I read it."
3,good story. a little too black and white for me.,"everyone is either an angel or a monster. i'm not buying it, reall"
5,The Best thing I have read on my journey so far,"This book is an amazing read. My son was born one year ago, and his diagnosis of Down Syndrome came four hours later - sending me and my family into an emotional tailspin.How I wish someone had given me this book then. I read so much, and so little of it was encouraging. As a fellow person of faith, her book impacted me as a mom, as a Believer, as an avid reader, as someone who loves to laugh and a person who longs for peace with my son's diagnosis.It's a great book, that I would love even if I couln't relate to her struggle with the impact of a child's disability. A great read."
2,writing gets in the way of the story,"I only started reading this book yesterday and was excited to read it as I'm very interested in spirit connection and miraculous happenings.However, last night after reading it in bed and as I turned off the light, I said to my husband, ""this author's writing style is getting in the way of the story."" Several of the reviews raved over her crafting of words to tell a story, but I honestly found them contrived and over the top. But maybe that's the point, her entire existence was admittedly trying too hard... but for me her overly-crafted prose sounds schmaltzy and irreverent.I want the story to bring me along, sweep me up and take me away - not cause me to have another conversation in my head about how the words have been strung together. It kind of defeats the whole point of reading!"
5,Magic,I think is a great book. I could not put it down. I told my daughter about the part that Adam gave the flower to his mom and after that she will ask me everyday tell me more about Adam. I loved the book and I learn a lot about priorities in Life
5,Extremely moving story.,"Beautiful, inspiring, funny, crazy book about Beck's experience carrying and then caring for her son Adam, a Down's Syndrome baby. Not only is Beck so honest sometimes she made me want to cry, but her story is just truly amazing. I don't know if I believe everything thing she was saying she experienced while pregnant with Adam (lots of really weird psychic-y stuff), but I do know that I really really want to. I loved this book."
5,ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVES,"This story would make such an awesome film! It's got all the elements of a great, uplifting family drama. It really makes you think about what truly matters in life, and what is essential to see in others."
4,Expecting Adam,"This is a book that I purchased for someone else. I'm not reading it so I can't really say, but I think it's fine because they requested it."
5,"Inspiring, The kind of book you can't put down",I really don't know how anyone could perceive this book as anthing but inspiring. The only way to describe this book is to say that it is a wonderful book about a family expecting their second child. The incredible events that took place during Marthas pregnancy are too amazing to describe here. You should really buy the book and read it for yourself.
1,Wow...was this BAD!,"I was so excited to read this for book club. It was a good topic and looked interesting and had lots of great reviews here on Amazon. Let's just say that only 2 of us in book club actually took the time to finish it. We didn't like the author's personality nor did we find much of the book believable. I love a great story if it is true or not, but this was BAD storytelling. It didn't ring true for the most part. I so wanted to love this book, but I didn't like it in the least."
5,Loved/Love this Book,"This book is beautiful, funny and absolutely moving. Martha Beck's writing really touches me. I found myself drawn to the unfolding events in the book. What a gift! What a journey!"
5,a moving story,The book was everything I expected. It was a retrospective of what I'd bet a number of parents could empathize with. I was surprised by all the spirituality and/or paranormal elements.
3,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed reading Dr. Beck's but and couldn't wait to get back to it. I found some of her discussion of the experinces the ""Bunraku puppets"" over the top. I did, however, find the book thought provoking and has already given several topics of discussion with my husband. I don't necessarily agreee with many of the writer's beliefs, but I found her writing enjoyable and worth discussion and reccomendation."
3,Went on too long...,"Kinda felt like 9 mos. had passed while I read this book, she really could have used a better editor. I did learn a lot about Down's Syndrome from Ms. Beck, which was interesting. Got bored with the constant Harvard references--enough already. Was distracted *SPOILER* by what has happened to the Beck's since this book was written--both spouses have ""come out"" and live with same sex partners. How that all came about would be an interesting book to me."
1,Very Disappointing,"I read this wonderful book not once, but twice, and recommended it to all of my friends and family. I found it beautiful, charming, uplifting, even transformational. Then Ms. Beck published a new book: ""Leaving the Saints."" For anyone considering purchasing either, I refer you to this thoughtful, intelligent review: http://www.sunstoneonline.com/Download/book-review.pdf. After reading it and many other reviews, I have sorrowfully arrived at the conclusion that ""Expecting Adam"" is a fictionalized memoir, and not the truth, as Ms. Beck claims. To find that Ms. Beck has so taken advantage of her readership's credulity is a grave disappointment."
4,I liked it,"I really liked this book. My book club chose it and I was a little skeptical. While the ""visions"" were not my favorite part of the book, I genuinely enjoyed the story. The author's humor in the face of adversity is truly a gift.Of course I read this book for pleasure but a lot of the themes really hit home. There are a lot of messages about living within your beliefs and values that affected me personally.I passed this on to a friend who recently experienced a death in her family and she enjoyed it as well.I would say read it without any preconceived ideas and then draw your own conclusions."
2,I am Conflicted,"First of all, the writing was beautiful. But the story, though tender and moving, was unbelievable. Ironically, I would have raved about it if it had been presented as a work of fiction the way the author is said to have written it originally. But as a memoir I cannot accept that many of the events the author relates could possibly be true. And I am more than surprised that so many readers seemed to accept all that the author said as gospel. I felt actually embarrassed for her and sad that her brilliant, luminous prose had to be tarnished by the untruths that she told."
4,I enjoyed this book a lot,"I read this book a few years ago and enjoyed it thourally. Handicapped children bring an aspect to their parents lives that so called normal children cannot. As a mother of an emotionally handicapped child I could totally relate to the author's feelings and had I known about my son's handicapped before his birth like Martha did, I would have never been able to abort him."
2,Boring,Not able to really get into the book. Keep trying but not enough to keep me into it more than a page.
1,Not worth the read,"This book was not very good. I am a true believer that every child is a gift, and that all children especially those with special needs teach us as parents what is really important in life. I was excited to read the book but it really fell short. After reading 1/2 the book I really have no interest in reading the 2nd half. The author tries to turn her morning sickness into a major dramatic highlight of the book. I don't doubt she was sick but it is not very interesting to read page after page detailed description about her morning sickness. I found the author to be rude and insulting toward her husband's family. Maybe she thinks her in-laws are boring and difficult to be around, but it seems cruel and disrespectful to talk about them like that in a memoir. I would be surprised to hear that her inlaws still talk to her after the horrible things she says about them in the book. Would not recommend this book."
3,A little beat up,"Food residue on back cover, corners and edges of book banged up, so it wasn't exactly as the seller stated... but I got it pretty fast."
5,"This is a must read, very inspirational book!!","I was completely blown away by this book. Every page taught me a lesson. This is a true story of two Harvard educated parents who find out that their son will be born with Down Syndrome and how they deal with that news during the pregnancy as well as after Adam's birth. It truly is a magical story and as the reader, I found myself swept up in the often humorous, very well told story. This book will stay with me for a long long time!!"
2,Decent Writer,"I was about three chapters into the book when I realized that I knew too much about the author of this memoir from recent news. I have no doubt that all of the things she describes in the book could happen and possibly actually happened to her and her family but how do you know what to believe from a person that you don't trust?That being said, Beck is a decent writer. She is sarcastic, caustic and occasionally funny (I enjoyed her descriptions of Harvard). Read as fiction, the story is moving and entertaining."
1,A disappointment!,"I was discouraged when I read this book. I had heard wonderful things about it and looked forward to reading ""Expecting Adam"" -- a selection for our book club. I was unhappy with the author's writing style -- she really does not write very well. It was too much of a memoir of her less than positive experience at Harvard and I kept thinking we were supposed to feel sorry for her. Going to Harvard full time, raising a child and then learning she was expecting a child with down's syndrome. Please, there are far more demanding problems in life! The paranormal experiences did not add much either. I would not recommend this book. It was a major disappointment."
2,A Disappointing Book,"I heard Martha Beck interviewed on the radio last fall and thought her book sounded interesting. It has taken me this long to find it in my library.I was put off by her way of going back and forth between present, past and future. It spoiled the flow of the story. The Harvard experience sounds awful, but Ivy League people have that mind set. As a Midwesterner I know, but don't let it bother me. There are many more important things than a degree from Harvard which I think she finally found out.The paranormal experiences were interesting and believable, but am sure bothered some readers.The last few pages (316-18) were the best."
2,Self-absorption,I was so disappointed in this book which our book club chose. Martha Beck is incredibly self-absorbed. I am curious as to how a book with so flimsy a plot could get published. Perhaps its Martha's ivy league education that allows for this after all. The stories of morning sickness are so exaggerated beyond belief. She should have lost her other child due to neglect. A disappointing read and author.
5,This book is about life choices and inner powers to guide,"Expecting Adam moved me beyond words, unlike Martha Beck who was able to beautifully capture the experiences of a lifetime in eloquent words. This book could fit easily into many categories, but I think it is most powerful as an expression of one womans ability to listen to the guiding spirit within and ignore the competing outside voices. It left me feeling empowered, moved to tears, laughing out loud, loving the people around me, and yearning for more."
5,overwhelming beauty and wisdom!,"I was overwhelmed by the beauty and wisdom (and sheer good writing) of Expecting Adam... for all who are searching for the Meaning of Life, the answer is right there on pg. 136! May I also recommend Life as We Know It by Michael Berubi, another title which addresses quality of life issues raised by the birth of a Down Syndrome child."
5,Reads like a novel!,"Martha has such a special insight to the spirit around her, it makes it possible for the rest of us to see/feel it, too!"
2,It's all about me.,"As a mother of a child with DS I was asked to read and comment on this book for a friend. The 'big picture' of this book is ""my child isn't really a child with DS, he is an angel riding in the body of a child with DS. (So sorry about YOUR poor child.) You get the feeling that she thinks an ordinary human child with trisomy 21 just couldn't happen to someone as special as she is (with 3 Harvard degrees)You leave not understanding that ordinary children with DS, with no angel but their assigned guardian, are lovely individuals made in the image of God.I have heard this book recommended for people expecting a child with DS and IMO this is a not a good fit.Good points: it was a quick read.ETA: My friend's sister (with 3 Harvard degrees) just gave birth to a little girl with DS. I'll be interested in what she has to say.;-)"
4,I really enjoyed this interesting book,"As an academic, I could really identify with Martha Beck's discussion of the conflict between the professional demands of graduate school, along with its complete emphasis on things of the mind, and the personal (family, love, etc). Fortunately, my own grad school environment was not as hostile as that she describes. I was shocked at the idea that others would insist she abort to protect her husband's career--I wondered if I had ever seemed as insensitive to my students and their personal needs. I was also impressed with Martha Beck's ability to embrace her non-rational side, and be honest about it, given her academic training. I liked her willingness to be open to the simple beauties in life that her son inspired. I really enjoyed the voice in which she wrote--I'd like to get to know her if she lived around here."
3,"ultimately uplifting, intermittently annoying","An exploration of the process of discovering that an expected child will be born with Downs Syndrome. The story is intriguing because it is set in the competitive mileau of Harvard, where the author and her husband were students during the pregnancy. Also unusual is that the expectant parents are blessed with visions during the pregnancy which help them cope and convince them that this is a special baby (shades of Touched by an Angel?). Beck's writing occasionally breaks down into the gushings of an adolescent girl. Still, it's a hopeful story, and will support readers dealing with similar situations."
5,My new favorite book,"I've had a hard time convincing several friends that this book, about a woman who has a Down syndrome child, is not depressing. It is in fact the opposite of depressing. I've changed my tact and am now telling people that it's a book about an extremely funny woman who is changed by the incredible experiences she has while pregnant with her second child. It is an uplifting, thoughtful, hysterically funny, well-written, self aware, skeptical, moving, beautiful book. Sorry for the cliche, but I really could not put it down. I recommend it to everyone."
5,Outstanding,"This book is thoughtful, personal, insightful, and outrageously well written. I never would have imagined that I could say that about a book concerning the decision to give birth to and raise a Down syndrome baby. The highly educated author, formerly an effete East Coast snob, received the highest quality of instruction and introspection through this process and with the wonderful assistance of her Down syndrome baby and then child. The author has a deeper softer side that I do and some of her quasi paranormal incidents were a big stretch for me, but nevertheless interesting and frank. Honestly, the book is a journey of personal experience and growth that few people would have the courage to commit to paper. I am not easily impressed, and I was impressed. An excellent read."
3,a suprisingly good read,I had to read this for a book club that i attend. I would not usually read a book of this nature. It was a bit slow in the beginning but then i could not put it down. I felt like i was part of the character and felt the emotions she felt. It was also a learning experience and an inside look at having a child such as Adam. I would highly recommend this book.
4,Naturally colorful,"As a librarian, I am always looking for great craft books that will appeal to children and their parents. This one is so captivating that I bought a copy for my niece! The instructions and illustrations are clear, and there are a variety of projects to choose from. Some projects require more adult supervision that others, and some require extensive preparation or effort. However, curious elementary students will hardly be able to wait to try these ideas. Because only ideas and instructions are given, rather than patterns and specifics, the results will be sure to reflect the individuality and creativity of the child doing the project."
4,"It's Like ""Gay Wedding By The Numbers""","All you need is this book, and a 3 ring binder and you areready to plan your gay wedding.This book helped me plan everything.Technical manuals should be written so well. If you are planning a gay wedding READ THIS BOOK FIRST, and I do mean first. It will save you time, trouble and keep you from committing a few faux pas."
4,How Normalizing!,"This is a good book, primarily because it uses a standard model, wedding guide, to meet the needs of a specific community, gays & lesbians. Bravo!Now it is time for the update!"
3,A Gay Wedding...? Why not!,"This is an interesting book more for its take on why commited Gay & Lesbian couples SHOULD get married, than for HOW to do it. Actually, a very good book to give to the parents of the bride(s) or groom(s)...in case they're having a hard time adjusting to the idea. Certainly well thought out and researched. A good companion piece to ""Let's Have a GAY! Dinner Party!"""
2,Misleading title,"As wedding guides go,this isn't a bad book but the title is misleading. There's very little in this book that is specfic to the gay/lesbian community. Its more of a generic wedding planning guide. I was looking for something with ceremony content tailored to this specific population. I was looking for some insights into this particular population to help me best meet their needs. I was disappointed on both counts."
4,Old book about Woodcock.,"The content of this book is what really lured me into the purchase. Considering it's age the book was in pretty good shape and as I expected per the seller's description. A great conservationist, upland bird hunter, breeder of setters, and simply a great guy all add up to make this book a keepsake! The different writers add plenty of variety to the subject of Woodcock."
4,The entire family enjoyed this.,"The family and I watched this together in rememberance of Blessed Mother Theresa and really enjoyed it. Usually I preview a movie for the kids (ages 6, 4, and 2) but I hadn't had time. My fears were for nothing. Yes, there were some scenes that brought up questions but all the scenes were done tastefully and my simple answers satisfied the kids (my oldest mainly). I also think the accents helped them miss some of the strife going on. It truly seemed like the kids understood the love of Mother Theresa and the others as they helped the poor and forgotten of India. And it tastefully opened their eyes that not everyone lives as we do."
1,disappointment and broken case,"The movie was not factually correct. The case was broken on the inside, so the DVD slid around inside. The woman did not accurately play the Joy of Mother Theresa. She was far too worried and concerned for much of the movie. I would not buy this."
1,Mother Teresa,"To someone else, this might possibly fill their need. Being an ordained deacon in the Catholic Church, I felt it was more Hollywood that actual events of Mother Teresa. I felt also that the main actress selected to play this magnificent person did not do her justice, inasmuch as she (the actress) has apparently fallen away from her birth faith. I don't see how you could portray someone when you don't follow your own needs."
1,Mother religious,"There's a pretty interesting approach to these religious films, an approach of cultic religion and of people using it as a veneer to hide serious structural defects in their souls and lives, and what happens when that facade starts to crack and fall off.This Mother Teresa flick is a bore."
4,A surprisingly good movie,"Not being catholic, yet appreciating some of what Mother Teresa had to say about service that is pleasing to God, I was caught up into watching this film. Production values are pretty good, though it's still clear it's a made-for-tv movie. I especially liked Olivia de Hussey in the lead role. A clean movie that gently teaches some good lessons."
3,a very good movie,"...a well produced movie, however it does not compare to the documentary by the Petire's, which contains actual video footage of Mother Teresa over the course of many years of on-site filming."
3,The movie is ok (good),The reason I gave three stars is because I thought the portrayal of Mother Teresa could have been produced a bit better!! It is interesting and accurate.
4,Pretty good,Pretty good. Acting was not the best I have seen but i still liked it. WOuld recommend to others. Hope you like as well!
1,Blessed Woman,I believe that probably the greatest missionary or catechetical tool for Christians today would have to be Mother Teresa. She exemplifies what Christianity is all about and epitomises the life and teachings of Christ.I think Mother Teresa: In the Name of God's Poor is a much better movie and would much more highly recommend it over this production.Consider also Mother Teresa by Petrie and the legacy as well.Truly a blessed woman.
5,Great movie,I purchased this DVD as a gift. This person who received it thought that the movie was well done and thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,Mother Teresa / Olivia Hussey,"Wonderful story and acting. I had hoped it would have been about her whole life from childhood through old age, howeverit focused more on her work in Calcutta. It was extremely well made."
2,"""A Classic"" as another reviewer said.....Oh Really?","Although the pics are great of the Stones and the stories are bwillyant I wasn't all about this book. Something was just missing since the Stones are getting older and the ""kickstand isn't always as strong as it once was""....(ie. these guys should break up while they are still held in high esteem). The Stones have already accomplished so much that it need not be put in a book but rather in a musuem."
4,great pictures!,"I have been a Stones fan for a long time and own several picture/coffee table books about them already, but I bought this book immediately after it was published in London. This volume has some of the greatest tour photography in it that I have ever seen. Only Annie Leibovitz' photo documentation of their 1975 American tour (some of it is included here)comes close to it. The book is a high quality production, both the color and the black and white images are very,very good. Do not buy this book for the text or a comprehensive road history of the Stones. That is the only weak point here (hence 4 and not 5 stars): the text, mostly quotes, is definitely weak. But there are other Stones books for that. This book is for the seasoned fan who is excited about reliving some of the greatest concert moments in these wonderful pictures, some of which have never been published before."
3,A Good Coffee Table Book To Impress Company,"""A Life On The Road"" .......... An impressive cover , hardback , looks great on the coffee table. Some of the photos are fresh and never been seen by myself before. However this is a compilation of quotations mainly. There are no new stories etc. I was expecting (per the books title) raunchy , exciting , interesting road stories. Silly me???? Once again , the books appearence is the most impressive portion of of this $38 investment. Pick up a copy of ""Up & Down With The Rolling Stones"" by Tony Sanchez. It is still the best Stones book I had ever read and I believe that I have read them all."
2,Uneven glorfication of the current Stones.,THe book is just uneven and self glorifying. Not nearly enough sixties pictures in here and again they pick on Brian and Mick Taylor the two best musicians to play with the group. Of course Brian is given no credit for starting the band. Frankly looking at photos of the Stones past the seventies (let alone hearing a good amount of their post Tatoo You music) is pretty horrid and they take up probably a good two thirds of the book. Skip it and buy Wyman's fantastic Rolling With The Stones. He is much more self aware as far as what the Stones best era was and is much more even handed assessing the groups talents.
4,good information on sites,"The details given in the book on the sites to visit are very good and detailed. A good addition would be more maps that show how to get there, since there are normally no sign and if you don't have a local tour guide or driver, it's difficult to find. The recommendations for hotels and restaurants could be better. Overall, a good book to travel around in Albania and it has been very helpful to me. The writer seems to have a good knowledge of the sites."
3,Obsolete guidance,"This book was indeed very useful and relevant as a travel guide when it was released nearly six years ago, but the changes in Albania since that time have been so sweeping that much of the practical information, such as accommodation, is nearly obsolete. I can personally testify that it is a fantastic and gorgeous nation of diverse cities and landscapes worthy of a long stay. For anyone who doesn't have the benefit of personal connection to serve as guidance there, an updated objective travel guide on Albania is certainly overdue."
1,albanian propaganda!,"I bought this book because it is the only one on the market these days in a western language. What a pity the editors of Blue Guide debased themselves to edit such a one-sided and partisan work.Not only does it make no difference between Albania itself and the (now thoroughly ethnically cleansed) NATO-protectorate of the Serbian province of Kosovo; even part of Macedonia are, without commentary, included as part of Greater Albania, and the book even includes a map of ""ethnic Albania"" including parts of Montenegro, Serbia itself and Greece (even Corfu!).Now I understand why other guidebook producers such as Lonely Planet did not undertake to make a book about Albania.As the author often points out himself, only the commitment to the ""Albanian cause"" in this book is important.I suppose the next step of BLue Guide will be some books about Libya by M. Ghaddafi, or about Palestine by A. Sharon!"
2,Description misleading,"Description said some wear, there was writing and highlighting along with tears and a broken binding."
5,Saga's Medieval Funk & Progressive Pomp,"This might be Saga's best album. There isn't a bad song here. The 1st song, Don't be Late, is to Saga what Stairway to Heaven is to Led Zeppelin. This is early 80's progressive rock at its finest."
5,One of Zaga's best Recordings,I saw the show when they went to Puerto Rico on tour on 1980 and the songs were very engaging and thought provoking. Tunes like Too much to lose and Time to go have a very special quality.
4,Definetly a star on the rise,"Having her two previous albums,I'm glad she decided to venture out of the ballad territory..She seems to improve each time. With upbeat songs like Dare you to be happy,Soulmate #9(awesome song) and dancy trance songs like Symphony of Life,If you ever, and Tangled she has some good ballads too, but not overflooding the album with them this time!being careful not to enter Celine Dion territory, and finding her own style.It's no wonder Tina Arena has become Australia's biggest female singer."
4,Underappreciated album,"This is an interesint follow up to Tina Arena's IN DEEP album. JUST ME is a collection of songs that lend themselves more towards dance. The songs ""Soulmate #9"" and ""Dare You To Be Happy"" are wonderful and funky with attitude. I really like ""But I Lied"", a nice rock-ish type track. There's some wonderful ballads here, namely ""You Made Me Find Myself"" which was covered by LeAnn Rimes a year after the release of this album, it's a beautiful well spoken ballad. ""Symphony of Life"" and ""God Only Knows"" are interesting ones too. I also really like ""Tangled"" and ""Something's Gotta Change"". Don't really care for the french tracks too much, they aren't bad but really seem out of place on here."
1,Tina Arena SUCKS!,"Overrated singer with a very plain voice. Responsible for the bad reviews of Notre Dame de Paris. No good as a singer, worse as an actress."
1,Not a history but an apology and a prediction.,"Ms. Paris is not a historian. She admits that primary sources are scarce. She has produced an ""explanation"" of how the Jews of Germany could have been taken in 500 years after the events decribed and how the ""fear of the Other"" continues today.This is a hard read as she skips back and forth and from place to place. She details the pogroms but not the accomplishments of the Jewish community. She virtually ignores the events in the rest of Europe and cannot tell us why Spain was different from France or Italy."
1,Excellent music - poor recording quality,"I was disappointed by the recording quality of this CD. The sound is very flat and muffled. Compare ""Cali pachanguero"" from this album to the same track on Grupo Niche's Serie Azul Tropical CD and you'll find that the latter has an audibly cleaner sound. I'd also recommend Greatest Salsa Classics (of Colombia) Vol. 1 instead of this CD. That album features Joe Arroyo's ""Pa'l bailador"" and ""Rebelión""."
3,A Cinderella Story Re-told,"I knew this book was used when I ordered it. It only cost $ .98...although the shipping was nearly $5. I am pleased, it is in pretty good condition. The only problem is that it has a little bit of a musty smell. Perhaps one should expect that with used books. The seller got it to me very quickly."
4,I love Tracey Mallett,"It is not my favorite Tracey Mallett work out, but if you have the time that it takes to complete the workout (it's longer than most), then you will feel as if you have exercised."
1,piece of junk,I ordered this oven less than two years ago. After my first use of the convection oven the casing cracked. The handle fell off after a couple of months but I was too lazy to send it back and I had to use a knife to open and close the oven door. After two years (I paid $145) it completely short circuited. This is not a quality product and not worth a penny. I was very very disap[pointed. Cuisinart is supposed to be a strong brand.
1,Cuisinart Convection Oven Toaster / Broiler CTO-350PC,"Bought and returned 2 of these.It only toasts bread on 1 side, the other side is not done.Might be ok for the oven part, but I never tried that.This is not a replacement for your toaster.For over $100 I would expect it to toast bread too.My $10 Proctor Silex toaster works better for toast."
4,A Great addition to the Horror Genre,It is so difficult to find a good horror movie. This is one. In a genre loaded with low budget stuff you rarely get a new movie that is pretty good. You won't be disappointed if you watch this movie.It isn't a big budget movie but they did a lot within their means and they bring us a pretty good horror movie.Worth a watch if you are a buff of the genre.
4,this splinter is a great film,I loved this movie! It kept my interest throughout.Gory? Yes but only one scene the squeamish should beware.The premis is simple....A young couple on their anniversary camping meet up with an excon and his druggie girlfriend.They drive to a gas station where their problems are just beginning.I was thinking the same as the previous writer....I enjoyed it!
3,where is the monster!,"I was really looking foward to seeing this film after hearing all the great reviews. I liked alot about this film. I liked the first showing of the monster/splinter thing, however, they did not really show a glimpse of the thing for the rest of the film. Also, the part where the guy freezes himself was ridiculous. Worth one viewing only"
4,Certainly worth watching.,"I don't like horror films, but this one was just a good movie. It's a little dated, but it's written well enough. It doesn't get out of control with the dumb things that people often do in horror films to get themselves killed."
4,It Will Put a Spike Through Your Horror Loving Little Heart!,"4 Stars = ClassicYou could do a lot worse than to check out this obscure sci-fi/horror, alien possession little gem of a film. With good acting, taught direction & fine effects for it's budget. A great little plot line, all set in the deep back woods of Oklahoma!""Splinter won six awards at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival: Best Editing, Best Score, Best Special Effects, Best Make-Up, Best Directing and Best Picture."" - WikipediaIt will put a spike right through your little horror loving heart!"
4,"3.5 stars, Little Prickers","Jill Wagner, yes, the Wipeout sideline host is in this. Fresh off her Mercury car commerical deal. Onto the film -- I'd heard good things about this movie from the one day it was in the theater. Did you blink because if you did, you missed it. The script and director keep it short and simple which is as it should be for this genre. We get enough character development to care and even reassess one party towards the end of the flick but not so much as to overwhelm the plot which is ""WHAT THE HELL IS THAT AND HOW DO WE KILL IT?!?!?"". The director of Legion should have seen this as a tutorial. What I think I liked best is some of dialogue seems very real, as if that is something that would be said as opposed to something a writer would think to have people say. My compliments to the screenwriter."
4,Decent movie that helped pass the time....,If you're looking for an academy away performance you won't find it here but if you want a decent horror/action flick to pass the time with you've come to the right place. The directing is by the numbers so it's not hard on the eyes. The acting is average for a direct to DVD release. The special effects aren't overdone and help add to the overall creepyness of the film. What really makes this shine is how creepy they've made the creature be. They've taken a very simple concept for a creature and turned it into something you definitely wouldn't want to bump into on a dark night. It's a very simple story that'll leave you wondering right up to the end. I gave it 4 stars because it did what I wanted it to do: it kept my attention and helped me pass the time.
4,Solid Little Horror Film,"The vast majority of straight to DVD horror films are garbage, pure and simple. This is not one of those films. At a tight 82 minutes, Splinter is a fun, intelligent, simple horror movie that will delight fans of the genre. All the actors of whom I had heard of none, were top notch. It's not particularly scary, but it does offer some decent jolts. What impressed me most was the dialogue. Pretty realistic and as I said, every performance was excellent. I wouldn't want to watch Splinter over and over, but it is better than many of the wide release major hollywood horror offerings as of late. Check it out."
4,Weak opening but a great indie horror movie,"The first thing I noticed about this movie that it is shot on video. It didn't ruin it for me but I definitely noticed and that's all. Acknowledged and moved on. Perhaps because of this and the poor acting and set design at the beginning (horrible scene with a couple going camping and deciding that camping is not for them, what? Why??) and that they are driving a car with ridiculous painted on `dirt' meant that it took about 15-20 minutes to settle in and enjoy it for what it is - a good strong indie horror. Beyond those opening minutes, the movie is great, a scary believable creature, nice snappy pace and some genuinely terrifying effects. It was obviously made on a budget and the director does a great job with what he's got. If it weren't for the poor plotting at the beginning that I already mentioned, I'd have given it five stars. I have to say is that this movie and `From Within' are by far the best indie movies I have seen this year."
1,QUIT SHAKING THE DAMN CAMERA!!!!!!!,"I can believe this, out of all these reviews, only one other person mentionswhat SHOULD be an obvious annoyance to everyone.SHAKY CAMERA!!! every time we think we are finally going to get a cool look atthe creature, the camera shakes so much that we actualy see little or nothing.When are these wet-behind-the-ears filmakers going to let this fad die???I may have half way enjoyed this little flick if they knew how to use a camera!Why go to all the money and effort for creature FX if your just going to ruin thefootage of it?The action scenes are hundreds of short pieces of film, shot in close-up, and shakingthe camera, all glued together so all you see is a mess of red streaks!!!!!Do you folks really LIKE this?? If not, why arent you sounding off about it?"
2,This could have been good....,"The story was a pretty decent, suspenseful tale, the acting was fairly good, but the choppy 'shaky cam' completely ruined this movie. In some movies, 'shaky cam' is necessary (e.g. the Blair Witch Project, and Cloverfield) due to the fact that we are supposedly viewing actual footage shot by a camcorder. It made no sense to do that in Splinter. Ultimately, it ruined the pacing and suspense for me because I was sitting there trying to figure out exactly what was going on. If not for the shaky cam, I would have easily given this movie 4 stars."
1,Splinter,"I felt cheated and robbed at the end of this movie.It was pure and utter drivel, an insult to even the remotest of intelligent beings.There was potential; but they squandered it away on the pathetic nature of a Splinter.This movie wasn't even worth one star."
4,A Gem of a Horror Flick,"someone recommended this and I'm glad I rented it. Sounds like a splatter movie, but while it fulfills that, it has unrelenting tension and the nightmarish quality of a dream where you cannot escape."
3,gnarley ideas and ok execution,Coulda really been good but just ok execution makes a great idea a taut scary lil movie. Scary monster!! The corny lines at times made me roll my eyes but the baddie was truly scary.
3,suprisingly decent movie,"Unfortunately you got to sit through a bunch of bad low budget movies to discover a good low budget movie. I'll save you the trouble, rent this one. Once again proving to the folks at Asylum low budget doesn't have to be an excuse to make bad movies. Very much in the vein of ""The Thing"""
5,This is the oldest thing I still have.,"I got this speaker around 1993? Don't remember the exact year. I've been consistently upgrading my computer since then except for the speakers. I can't comment on if they are good quality or not, since I don't consider myself an expert, but holy hell I think this speaker is now a part of my family after 20 years."
5,Recommended desktop Bible companion,"My 1975 printing of this great tome sits, along with my Smith's Bible Dictionary, at the choice spot on my reading table. As interesting as the commentary itself are the 150+ pages of ""articles,"" or essays covering subjects from ""Hebrew History to the Exile"" to ""Bible Chronology."" The motivating sentiment of the authors was, as stated in the ""General Introduction,"" that ""[t]he Bible is the source as well as the result of inspiration... Every detail regarding it therefore is interesting."" In the minds of the commentarians, then, there's no such thing as ""Bible minutiae,"" a de jure oxymoron.The commentary enjoys a balanced feel between the contextualist (generally Catholic) and literalist (flavors of Protestant) schools of Bible thought, and is a great source for throwing a little extra light on some of those obscure passages. I use this commentary with Josephus' Antiquities to really help me on understanding some parts of the O.T."
1,Didn't work for me.,Regrettably I had to wait for a UTI before I could write a review. I felt a UTI coming on (flu like symptoms and a fever) and I checked three (3) times and all three were negative. The symptoms persisted however and I went to immediate care and their test was positive.
1,Muddled : sacrifices clarity for scope,"I finally got round to burning my old copy of this book today . Never really used it . It's just such a dreadfully dull read . How to learn jazz is learn songs . Nail the theory of the song you've learned , and go on to the next song . If there's a point you missed ... ask someone , or post on the web . Don't bother with this book : it's very badly written . The author is not very good at clear argument . Instead he just puts up more and more pointless 'examples ' . Its big , its impressive , its scholarly , .... but for learning to play jazz , it's a dead loss ."
1,Very unprofesional display,"I read the reviews, I went through the site, I checked around... Seemed like a great book to get a hang of jazz theory...I have one problem though...I can't read music. And NOWHERE in this whole reviews or description is it mentioned that this book has ONLY MUSICAL NOTATIONS.I've bought a few books on music and have actually picked up quite a bit through tabs (My instrument happens to be the guitar.)Now when I get to the returns section it says I have to ship it right back to the US of A... while all incoming packages are shipped by Amazon to a local courier who then delivers it to respective addresses.What a sham! Overall all those who might be toying with the idea of picking up this book BEWARE. ITS MANDATORY TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND NOTATIONS.Otherwise well the money's down the drain... at least for me for now I guess..."
3,good but not the only jazz theory book,"This book is very good and I recommend it to any serious music student. I learned a lot from it and it gave me plenty of new information and insights. It is also valuable as a reference with excellent indicies and appendices, for example a long list of contrafacts based upon standard song forms. My main criticism of it is that it is very piano-centric. Most examples are given in complex two-handed piano-score format which is great if you can sight read complex piano parts, but are not immediately helpful if piano is your second or third instrument. Also, examples and contexts reflect the author's own personal tastes heavily. There is nothing really wrong with these things, but for a book that seems to present itself as the authoritative text on jazz theory, it's not. I think Bert Ligon's series of books presents a more comprehensive, accessible, and balanced overview of jazz theory, and is more oriented towards musicians in general, not only pianists."
4,90% duplication of Mark Levine's other Jazz book,"I am writing this review to point out that Mark Levine publishes TWO Jazz theory books "" The Jazz Theory Book (1995)"" and ""The Jazz Piano Book (1989)."" Amazon shows incorrect dates for these books. I purchased both here on Amazon. To my suprise, the two books are virtually the same with frequent identical paragraphs of text, illustrations, chapters, etc. Jazz Theory Book is essentially an update version of Jazz Piano Book. Both are superior well written music theory works but it is not necessary to own both. Either one of them is a must have for any aspiring Jazz pianist or theory hound. I am keeping the Jazz Theory Book since it is newer. I feel that Amazon or someone should point this 'duplication' out."
5,The best!!,The most comprehensive jazz theory book I've ever used. Have used it for private students and in fundamental jazz theory classes. Its logical presentation of material and easy-to-understand explanations make it the most user-friendly encyclopedia of jazz theory that I've seen.
5,THE Book on Jazz Theory,"There is no question in my mind that this is the best jazz theory book there is. Not only that, it is the best by far. Also get ""Scales for Jazz Improvisation"" by Dan Haerle for quick reference and I guarantee you'll be set."
5,The Best!!!,This book is like the best for theory anyone who wants to really get deep into theory and get to understand it this is the book for u I always read it when I can u can never get enough.
5,Mark Levine's Jazz Theory Book,"As a jazz player and college-level teacher it is difficult to select a single book that addresses all of the most important topics for students of jazz. The Jazz Theory Book does just that with a very clear design that includes hundreds of excerpts and examples. Study this book, play your instrument,and reap the benefits of having the skills to understand the mechanics of this grand music."
5,Best book on Jazz ever written,By far the best book on jazz theory / musicever written. Fun to read and it covers itall from the beginning to the end. Mark Levineis one of the best jazz educators ever!!!!!
5,Great overall book ! 2 Thumbs up,This is a very well written book. It is very easy to read and apply. Simple practical concepts that will definitely cause your level of playing to go up a notch. Great piece of work.
1,You've got to be kidding!,"Unbelievable. I wanted a strategy guide, something to help work through the wonderfully complex levels. I also wanted to know what points garnered recognition (medals, promotions, etc.). You wont' find it in here. Several of the loadout pages for certain missions aren't even possible. The secret agent portion is not even included. A huge dissapointment. My recommendation is save your money and play the game. You'll have more fun and get more bang for your buck."
4,Primordial Undermind - 'Yet More Woners Of The invisible World' (September Gurls),"Believe this title to the second release on the September Gurls label that I've ever done. Looks to be the band's very first effort. I didn't know that guitarist Eric Arn was once in Crystalized Mover. Total of thirteen cuts here to make an impression on you of just what this under-appreciated psych band is capable of. Tunes I liked best were ""Feeding The Breach"", ""An Exercise In Torsion"", the ass-kicking ""Swimming In The Untramaroon"" and ""Through The Cracks"". A definite Thirteenth Floor Elevators and Seeds 'vibe' is hard not to notice. A must-have"
2,POOR REASON TO GET MORE MONEY,"I agree with the previous review. I'm a diehard fan, but to sell the season this way (in 2 parts) is unfair to loyal viewers. So, why did I purchase it? I'm asking myself that too ... all I can really say is I want the complete season; that's how much I like the show. But, the is a poor way to get more money. If you're going to sell ""the season"", then do just that!"
3,Paying extra for one season...,"This show has become my absolute favorite. Only reason this has lost two stars is because they did two parts instead of one. Though the second part is less, you shouldn't have to pay for two parts when they could make it one."
1,Major ripoff,The series was broken into 1st half and 2nd half. With only 10 episodes this is not worth it. Probably will not buy season 7.
4,Good Viewing,The second part was good. Sad ot see some of the main characters leaving.I don't know why this season was split into 2 sets.
4,Good story,"I love movies but am not a big fan of horror films. However, many of my students love them and tell me I should see this one or that one, which I do from time to time. I watched ""Serum"" and was greatly surprised. Naturally, there was the gore and violence that I do not normally like, but the film also had a story, which was refreshing. The filmmaker created an interesting plot and took time to develop the characters, which made you more invested in them. Obviously, it was a small budget film, but it didn't matter because you liked the characters and wanted to find out what was going to happen next. And, I thought the production value was better than many other independent movies I've seen."
1,TERRIBLE quality,"The video is so much worse than bad it's not even funny. I made it less than five min. before throwing this movie away. Seriously it was as if someone built a time machine, went back to 1913, purchased a, then top of the line camera, which is the equivalent to video from a cell phone 5 years ago, filmed a movie for idiots in the worst quality imaginable. Why didn't they use the time machine to go into the future, grab one of those space cameras that I've been reading so much about and film an idiot movie in the best possible quality. Even better than that they could even film it in the future, since it's the future, they could find the 2 idiots that actually like this movie and work them in as extras, of course they might be too busy ""making a family"" with their cousins, and not even one of the hot ones, but the one that always has a rash."
5,The heart in skating,"This beautiful work gives us an open and confrontingly honest view into the life of a world champion in a sport little heralded or even known in his own country.It alows us to share the journey of growth through life, love, sport and sexuality of a man of great character.A must read for all those who searh for honesty and compassion in a world often devoid of both."
5,One of the most honest books you'll ever read.,"Jayson gives an open, honest and heartwarming look into the up and downs that have been his personal and skating life. I found it inspiring. He gets back up every time he's knocked down and inspires courage to do the same. If you ever have been at a crossroads in life you will relate to his story."
5,Spindrift novel of the ski-bum life,"This is a period piece. The boots are leather, with laces. There's a psyceldilic Volkswagen van, pot in the oregano jar, and the evil Corporation trying to cope with the counter-culture. Altogether, a delightful yarn about nothing in particular except skiing the most beautiful mountains in the world, and those skiing scenes are wonderfully well written. The town is Aspen, of course. (I know because I read the book last winter in the Pitkin County Library, on the recommendation of a ski patrolman who knew the author way back when :) Great stuff, especially for skiers and anyone who was young in 1970."
3,Average Minus,"Average Minus- it is ok, but no more; very basic, not enough info, and pale in comparison to other Publishing books. Also not up to date."
4,Waterford Baby Bottle,"While the bottle itself was in excellent condition --- the box was not in what I would call presentation condition.In giving it as a gift, the box made the item look cheap and old."
5,Best tinted moisterizer ever!,"This product was recommended by a dermatologist years ago -- I don't even go to her anymore -- but I have used it since. It is a tinted moisterizer with 45 SPF, is light, and some days I use ony it without any makeup base. I have keenly sensitive skin and react to almost all the over-the-counter products, but have never had any kind of negative reaction to this - I would highly recommend it to anyone! Grandmahonny"
3,Works very well but leaves a greasy look - you must follow up with powder,"This is an excellent product as it has a high SPF and blocks both UVA and UVB rays - which many products don't. However, it leaves a greasy look and feel so I must use powder over it.I use it on weekend mornings because on Sat and Sunday I am in the sun a lot more than during the week and need a higher SPF than I get from my foundation primer (Smashbox Photo Finish with spf) and foundation during the week. I have several bottles, but once I finish them up will try some alternatives."
3,Good for dry skin...requires oil or MU remover.,"Active ingredients combine chemical and physical: Octinoxate (6.5%) and titanium (3.5%). Other INGREDIENTS: Water, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Isopropyl Palmitate, Isocetyl Stearate, Sunflower Oil, Squalane, Dimethicone Copolyol, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Chloride, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Silica, Melanin, Iron Oxides, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.This really reminds me of Sofina's Perfect UV, so I like the texture and powdery feel after it's applied. It has a tint, but not like a MU...more like a tinted moisturizer. I think the buff color is there to hide the white titanium, but it doesn't leave a color on your face.This does have a lot of silicones, so you should remove with oil or a MU remover, or you'll break out if you're acne-prone.I wouldn't buy this again because it requires an extra step in my routine (oil remover), but I do like it for occassional use."
4,GIVING CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE,"In the 70's, when Denver was at his creative and commercial peak--because he looked like a dork and made bad movies with George Burns and bad TV shows with the Muppets--it was not hip to like his music. I must admit that as a younger man I succumbed to this reasoning myself. I listened to James Taylor and the Eagles but turned my nose up at Denver, whose one hip credential at the time was writing ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" for Peter Paul & Mary. . .But if you listen to some of these songs you will realize, if only in retrospect, that there is some real poetry, and some genuine musical majesty working here--particularly in ""Rocky Mountain high"" and ""Take Me Home Country Roads"", two of the best hit records of the decade. ""Goodbye Again"", ""Starwood in Aspen"" and ""Rhymes and Reasons"" are underrated songs that would have gotten a lot more respect if they'd been on a James Taylor or Dan Fogelberg album.Fair is fair. The guy could write a song."
3,"Fantastic music, bad quality CD","John Denver's music, musicianship, and voice have a special quality that will be difficult to match. The songs on this album are just beautiful.On the other hand, the quality of the sound on this CD is close to the worst I have ever heard. It is tinny, noisy, distorted, harsh, and you can hear pitch variations on several songs that seem to come from problems with the master tape. The mixing is such that often the lyrics are drowned out by the music."
3,Songs wrong,About half of the songs on CD do nor match those on booklet or the Amazon list. Another example of Chinese quality control?
5,Great collection of feel-good John Denver tunes,"I am not a huge John Denver aficionado, so I am not in a position to comment on whether this is a definitive collection of John Denver or whether anything important was left off the album. Neither am I a super audio-technophile, so I can't comment on the technical aspects of production. All I can say is that I have very fond memories of Take Me Home Country Roads, Poems Prayers and Promises, and I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado from when I was a young man (I used to play the last two songs on my guitar a lot), and it was great to hear these songs again. Kinda wish My Sweet Lady was on this album, and I wondered if perhaps I shouldn't have gotten the Poems, Prayers, and Promises album on CD. Six-in-one, half-a-dozen in the other--P,P&P contains some songs I don't care for so much, while the Greatest Hits has some wonderful tunes that the earlier album doesn't, such as Follow Me and P,P&M's Jet Plane."
5,so inspiring!!!,"having died in a plane crash in, was it 11 years ago now, his music is still as popular as it was back in the day!!! those who like listening to his folksy country - rock style will love this collection. listen to the selections above. i find this and other classics from yesteryear easy to listen to, especially when i'm working. some other folks' works distract me, john denver's music passes by and, before long, i have to re-start the cd player. i think that this is well worth the price new, but keep an eagle eye out for deals used."
5,John Denver's Greatest Hits,I bought this and I absolutely love it. I play it over and over. It's so soothing. John's voice is so pure and the lyrics so meaningful. I wholly recommend this cd!
3,Disappointing,"This album was released early in Denver's career, as such it misses his greatest work such as the legendary Back Home Again album. By far the best Denver CD is the Australian compilation Favourites (sic). It is worth hunting down a copy. GH is for die hard fans and collectors only."
3,John Denver,I was never a huge John Denver fan... but the songs of his I do like are this cd. That was why I got it to begin with. If you never listened to John Denver and want to give him a try.... i would say this might be a good one to try.
3,This CD has too little depth.,"As a long-time John Denver fan, I enjoy perhaps most of all the fullness of John's high tenor, joined by the richness of the various orchestrations he uses. However, on this disc, his voice sounds flat, as do the various instruments. Indeed, all the music sounds too clean, as if, in making the CD version, the sound engineers scraped away everything except the notes. I have been very disappointed in this CD. Other John Denver CDs are much better than this one."
5,The Real Best of John Denver,"This is what you want if you want original John Denver. The recent ""Best of"" are remakes. Listen to samples of the same song and compare. You can tell the difference."
3,"John Denver was talented,but had no love for all man.","As we can see by this music, John Denver was a talentedand gifted man. But he didnthave love for all man. So iwould not reccommend this music. But my heart saysi should give it 3 stars.Thanks Jack Ellis..DCW CRITICS@onebox.com"
2,"Brings back memories, and ones I wish I never had","I remember the days of singing ""Take Me Home"", and I still like the song, but that's not enough to make me a fanatic about this album. I like ""Back Home Again"" alot better than this. I know ""Starwood In Aspen"" and ""Rhyme and Reason"" are enough to make me an emotional cripple as they cut me to tears. There is some other good stuff like ""The Eagle and The Hawk"" I would've loved it if Denver stretched it out for a little longer than the 2 minutes and 10 seconds that's on here, ""Sunshine"" is also a lovely song I can't deny that, ""Leaving On A Jet Plane"" is pretty decent, but I like Peter Paul and Mary's better. This is just a below par compilation. It's not too too bad, but it's also not the greatest either."
4,John Denver Greatest Hits - Nostalgic Classic,"John Denver Greatest Hits - Nostalgic Classic. I loved this album when it originally came out. Everyone was grabbing their guitars and playing along. Denver's voice in these classic hits is stunning. The only downside is the old analog technology it was recorded in. As soon as the first note plays, you can tell it lacks the clarity of a digitally remastered album or a newly recorded album. Still, it is filled with great songs by a great artist."
5,Great collection of John Denver songs,This CD has nearly all of his most familiar and greatest songs. Love it!
1,Poor Sound Quality,"If you are looking for a good John Denver album this is not it, unless you like AM radio sound quality. The songs on this album are great, but I recommned picking a different John Denver album."
2,Not good for exploring off the beaten track,"This map would be good for a tourist planning on spending a few days in Prague and strictly sticking to the major monuments. It only shows a very small portion of the city. If you're planning a longer stay, you might want a map that shows more."
4,Another great Bill Morrissey CD,"The world changes, the millenium has ended, wars come and go, but Bill Morrissey stays the same. You can't compare this singer to anyone else, a voice that seems to be asking for a headphone or your ear on the speaker, and at the same time with such a perfect diction you dont need the lyric booklet at all. The music is also understated, everything here is the opposite of the big hit. It's like one of those Satie gymnopedies. Morrissey is telling the listener: Sit down and listen, but if you dont want to do it that's OK too.If you liked his precious cd's then you'll like this one too for sure. If you have never heard him it's a good place to start, as are all his other cd's."
3,suitable party toy,"I got this for my son's birthday party and it arrive in suffient time. Don't think that is a sturdy toy. It is just a party favor. It was a hit with the kids. The handle most likely break off and the rubber sticky piece will too. This is not for babies. I would say 6yrs and up or for kids that know what to put in ther mouth or not. geat party bay assessory. When I put it in the goodie bag, I put the toy in a plastic sandwich bag as it is sticky and you don't want it to stick to anything inside the bag."
2,Disappointing!,"How would you like to read a book on the subject of genocide by an author who treats hearsay as historical fact? If a historian cannot maintain objectivity and fails to present all evidence, including those that might be contrary to his point of view, then his work would be flawed. I found in this book judgements and conclusions that were reached without thorough and serious research. Pity."
2,Not as good as season 1,"I teach a ground school for flight students, and I had been using season 1 of Mayday for a long time. I was starting to get sick of seeing some of the season 1 episodes a hundred times so i decided to purchase seasons 2 and 3. If you liked season 1 because it focused on the accident and the investigation, you might be disappointed with these 2 seasons. They focus more on the passengers and their emotions (not that I am emotionless... or heartless, but I care more about the accident itself). They also try to over-sensationalize the accidents with flashing screens and screaming passengers which bothers me... just stick to the facts."
2,No season 4,I've watched 2 of the 3 blue ray disk and at least 2 episode have severe audio sync problems and all the episode are from season 3 that right no season 4.
5,The Broken Mirror,"This is a book meant for younger readers, but is a good read for any age group, and a good starter book about the Holocaust.Moishe is the only survivor after his family is taken away to the death camps. He is taken to a Catholic orphanage, where he denies he's Jewish, and calls himself Danny in an effort to forget the past. He runs away from the orphanage after his best friend is adopted. He is taken in by a rabbi and his family after Moishe hears a familiar song coming from a synagogue, and goes to investigate--bringing him full circle."
3,My first book on the Holocaust,"Kirk Douglas the actor, turned writer wrote this delightful short novella for children and adult alike. This is a fabulous read to young children who are interested in learning about the Holocaust, or for those who need to do a project on the horrific events.The young child and innocence is awe inspiring. Moishe, a young Jewish boy is ashamed of his roots when America nazis invade the farm he is living in. His pity on himself is unfortunate because no one should be ashamed of themselves.Learning more about Moishe and his inner thoughts would have been nice rather than about the layout of the farm or other family members.It is ironic that the hate he had for himself and culture was quickly changed when he realzied, after being adopted by a Catholic family was where he fit in. This is a quick, good read better suited to the younger generation."
2,Dissonance galore,"Too much for me. Maybe it's called improve.Six more words required to submit. Six, five, four, three, two, one."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this one!","I have some experience in this field, but was hoping to sharpen my skills. Expecting the book to be ""basic"", I thought the book would include in-depth explanations, i.e. a ""how to"" book. It was nothing of the sort.The book is out of date as well. The industry has moved on and left this writing in the dust.The book is poorly written. There are countless places where the proof readers (assuming they were used?) failed. Example: ""While each individual case is different."" This is NOT a sentence. It is an incomplete thought and this book is chocked full of them.The book is supposed to be basic and the chapter on ""documenting the loan package"" is nothing less than pathetic. It doesn't come close to explaining how a loan is documented.Finally, don't even think about buying the author's Advanced Loan Processor Training Manual. It's just as bad and includes little more than what is in the basic book."
5,A sweet surprise...,"I was introduced to Lucero and found a whole new appreciation for this style of music. Luckily, my first encounter with them was live in Nashville at 12th and Porter, and now I can't seem to stop listening to the CD over and over and over. The lead singer's voice is truly unique with expressive lyrics about the things of life. The steel guitar wins my heart, almost sounding as though the lyrics are moaning with it... I HIGHLY recommend this CD. It's a must! Their first CD is not too bad, either... a little more raw, a little less produced, yet I must say that this band should go FAR. I cannot WAIT for them to get themselves back to Nashvegas so I can see them live again... I'm telling you... this is THE band. :)"
5,Pain encapsulated,"If you've ever even vaguely liked alt-country, and if you've ever experienced pain of the heartbreak variety, buy this album right now! Lucero is one of the most incredible bands out there, both live (if they come within a 500 mile radius of you, go see them!) and on this album. Also, you can listen to great non-album and live tracks on their web site...Their songs just drip ache, but in that good way."
5,entertaining,"very good recording by these soon to be legendary fine men.If you are a lumberjack or have any interest in it, you should buy this digital disc.Im impressed with the songscrape created by this extraordinary recording.It evoks my thoughts on the world at present and how we live in terrible times.Also the cd cover is outstanding.......i sw it sitting in my local independent record store........tower.........and bought it for 15 bucks in an instant.I took it home, played it on my amstrad stereo and was amazed at the waves of sound that greeted me!In fact this band is so good, im seriously thinking of giving up my job as a male model and becoming a groupie for this band..............seriously.,.....they are that good!"
2,An overrated band,"I really want to like this music, but it's so formulaic and soulless. The vocals are stiffened by some forced folksiness, and the lyrics are repetitive and empty. They sound like hipster guys playing old-country dressup, like protected, untorn hearts going for broken and battle-scarred (I don't know for a fact that these guys haven't been through the things that so often make great country music, I'm just saying that this is what their music sounds like)."
3,I heard this band 12 years ago...,when they were called Uncle Tupelo.Or if you prefer...Uncle Tupelo called... they want their sound back.
5,Best Soundtrack I know,"It's not only a soundtrack but also a great hip hop album.I've never got a chance to see the movie but this CD is great.All track are good but there is one standout.The track from Common - High Expectations.Is the most beautyfull song i've ever heard.Everytime when I hear this song I remember my days on the basketball court.It has so much to do with my life.It's like a reflection, or better a flashback.I can hear it everytime and i never get tired of it""Schools want me, but the ghost of Manigault haunts mePlus they wanna crib me, way out in the countryI'm city like street lights and some games that be fightsNever worked on my left so it's hard to be rightEither rich poor or Mike is who I wanna be likeStory of many black males that I refuse to rewrite"" Common Sense - High Expectations!"
3,I love you most of all,"This CD features most of the non-Beach Boys records that Brian Wilson produced back in the '60s and '70s. The most notable omission is ""The Surfer Moon"" by Bob & Sheri. None of the songs here were hits and, in fact, Brian never produced a hit record for anyone other than The Beach Boys. Was it that Brian saved his best material for The Beach Boys, or was it that the other artists he worked with weren't that talented? Probably a combination of the two (although no one would say that Glen Campbell was untalented). Truthfully, the songs here just aren't as good as The Beach Boys best material. There are a few minor gems here, but for the most part, the songs are pretty forgettable. This is a well put together package that will appeal to Brian Wilson fanatics, but most other people probably won't like it very much."
2,Kung did not address the proper issues in this work.,"In this work, Hans Kung attacks people and philosophies associated with atheism, including such crackpots as Marx, Neitsche (or however its spelled), Freud, and Feuerbach; but fails to address such fundamental questions as ""Why should we believe in God at all?"" I give him two stars for his scholarship, but I am disturbed that he failed to address this central issue. He seems to think that he has destroied atheism by destroing Marxism, nillism, and other philosophies which are atheistic but upon which atheism itself is not dependant. I would recommend any atheists persuaded by this work to read Atheism: The Case Against God by George H. Smith."
1,Hans Kung's unanswered question,"Kung's theistic diatribe is typical of most polemics against Atheism I have read in the last 42 years, in that, as per usual, its central thesis comes to no conclusion, and its answer is just another illogical, unverified ""assertion"". Meanwhile, the reader is forced to wade through 800 pages of logical fallacies, didactic circles, and flagrant contradictions; only to end up with, either god exists or nihilism. Bull! But, on the other hand, in perusing those circles, and dodging the fallacies the consummate god-head is in some of the best cherry picking territory I have seen since David Hume blew creationism out of the water more than 200 years ago."
1,THE WRONG QUESTION,"The question, actually, is not if God exists, but if you exist,---and you don't! Good luck!"
2,Very dissappointed:(((,"I am a freestyle lover!! I go to all the concerts state to state and love every minute of it. I was excited to but this, I though wow 4 cds of my fav music. Well to be short, I lony like the cd #4 the others suck. Its not just me either. My husband is a DJ and grew up with the music just like me n he thinks the same and so does my best friend. So my opinion is research the songs good b4 u buy it because it is not the originals that u grew up with hearing on the radio and in the clubs or cd's, but #4 cd in the pack is the only good one, I threw the other 3 in the trash:((("
2,Total Crunch!,"I was very disappointed. I hoped getting a product by a company that makes things for curly hair, that they'd understand the needs. This product, even if I used only a bit of it, made my hair stiff, crunchy and stuck together. I tried to squeeze and decrunch the hardness out of it, but I lost my curls. It took care of flyaways, but only because it made everything glued together. I'm going back to Crew forming cream. It is the only thing that totally works to make my waves and curls get more shaped and not frizzy."
5,Keith Urban Fantastic,"A great natural product that smells great and is a wonder for naturally curly crazy hair. Has a light smell of the clove ingredient, among the other natural stuff, always the best way to go when you have problem special needs hair and want to stay away from all the bad stuffthat will only make you hair worse and more hard to handle."
2,Mediocre smelly product,I don't know what's different about this product compared to any other hair gel you could buy at a drugstore. What is different is the smell...not so nice...not a pleasant fragrance...hard to describe. I went back to using my Nexxus Mousse Plus -- much better for volume and curls (I have fine dense hair).
4,Across the Nightingale Floor: Tales of the Otori,"Having visited Japan recently, and having walked across the real Nightingale floors I found this book hard to put down. The author has come out of no where with a great piece of work. A must for anyone who is looking for a different sort of novel.Cant wait for the sequal."
5,Excellent Story!,"This book is among my favorite books that I've ever read. The characters are interesting, most with some form of torn loyalty. The action in the book is very well written and paced, and the story seems to simply draw the reader more and more into it as events happen. I really can't wait for the next one to come out."
3,Mediocre at best,"While it's not necessarily a bad book, it doesn't even begin to live up to the hype surrounding it. Book magazine had a small and glowing review of the book as did the Book Sense 76 list for September and October. Several independent bookstores are giving it prominent shelf position - often with staff recommendations. I generally put a lot of stock in the reviews of these two publications, but I was very disappointed this time.The plot itself had a lot of promise, but none of the possibilities touched upon were ever fully fleshed out. The story was begging for a book three times as long with three times the detail. If some of the other reviewers are correct in their assertions that the author primarily writes children's books, it explains quite a bit about the simplistic (and to be honest, quite bland) prose. Buy it for your preteen kid(s) - or better yet, borrow it from the library."
5,"Pretty much an awesome book of fighting, romance, betrayal, and all those things in the japanese era","most likely the best book in the series due to Lian Hearn's style of writing... an incredible amount of action occurs yet a 'completitive stillness' is achieved by the end. a good transformation in the character of Takeo from a country boy named Tomasu to a boy beckoned quickly to manhood by circumstances. well developed characters...Kaede, Takeo's lover, adds to the urgency of the story and isn't just a romantic article but a key component to the plot. interesting plot filled with action...sure to be devoured by fantasy lovers. leaves off for a sequel perfectly by keeping pace throughout and hinting at things to come. all in all, a definite read for those interested in a new type of fantasy."
4,good story,I didn't think the writing of this novel was anything extraordinary. It had a kind of wishy washy undertone that reminded me of cheesy romance novels. The story was great though. It kept me ingaged and I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
3,"A chopped up & mixed up X-men, Musashi and the Tale of Genji","For you who needs a light, easy book to read, this is one (and the other two). It is a TOTAL fantasy, with not much sense of reality. This book is a combination of X-men comics, Musashi and the Tale of Genji, maybe with a dash of spy novels influence such from Robert Ludlum's. The plots are too easy, the characters too few. The development of Takeo and Kaede too rushed. I do, however, find the books to be lively and not boring, quite enjoyable actually. Hey, that would be great if I got up one day after a stressfull day and suddenly have all those powers and learn everything in a year or so. Like I said, it is a TOTAL fantasy."
2,Could have been one book,"I wonder if the author hasn't been mostly ""inspired"" by the ""Cloud of Sparrows""/""Autumn Bridge"". Most of the names in these three books are borrowed from there. I admit that reading the trilogy after ""Cloud of Sparrows"" was like going to the movies after reading the book the movie is based on - it is not completely disappointing, but the three-dimensional images in your head are put onto the two-dimensional screen. And these aren't your images either.Save yourself the money and buy ""Cloud of Sparrows"" - feudal Japan portrayed with love and sincerity."
4,I found this first installment entertaining enough,"Quick review: I downloaded the Audible version of this book and listened to it while I got things done around the house. It was engaging enough to have me working all day long, and I enjoyed listening. The narrators bugged me at first but I got used to them. I recommend for the non-judgemental, just-want-to-have-fun readers not looking for a historical novel but appreciative of the reference."
4,"A bit cliched, but enjoyable","***1/2The best thing about the Nightingale Floor is the sumptuous detail of its part-fantasy medieval Japanese setting. The book's world, from people's attitudes, to the descriptions of the scenery, to the courtly manners, to the way the characters speak, feels lovingly derived from Japan and its myth.The plot, however, is standard escapist fantasy stuff. There are obvious good guys and bad guys, the protagonists instantly fall in love, and some characters turn out, unsurprisingly, to be not what they seem. The cliches keep this book from being as memorable as it might have been, but Hearn otherwise does a nice job of transporting readers into a world of danger, intrigue, and high honor not often visited by Western fiction. If you're looking for a light, entertaining read in a well-rendered exotic setting, you could do a lot worse than this one."
3,adventure with a bit of romance,This is quite the wonderful story. Subterfuge and stategy run throughout the story. It is well written and is a fairly entertaining book
5,exquisite and full of love and betryal,"i was forced into reading this book, but after the first few pages i couldn't stop reading it a fantastic tale about a young boy takeo (tomasu). His family were killed by Iida, and shigeru (head of the Otori clan) rescued him by not by chance but by coincedence. We then read about how takeo saved shigeru's life when he heard someone climbing the side of the house. I felt great anger when kenji kidnapped takeo and betrayed shigeru. At this point i became so attached to this book reading about takeo and kaede falling in love and their divided loyalties also the fight for alligances and against the Tohan clan. Reading about shigeru's death brought tears to me eyes as i felt takeo's greif and was overwhelmed by his loyalty to shigeru hleping him die like a true warrior. This book grew on me and i knew it inside out and im now onto reading the second book 'Grass for his pillow' ***** which is just as good!"
4,Great book! Must read!,"I was walking by the bookstore the other day when this book's cover caught my eye. Being the lover of Japanese culture that I am I picked the book up, skimmed through a few pages and thought ""What the heck; it's been a while since I read something.2Basically I read it all in one day. the book was quite good; it kept me glued to it from begining to end and still wanting more afterwards. I then lent it to my girlfriend and she simply loved it. I'm looking forward to the next instalmenent. If you like stories about ninjas, samurais, fuedal battles and the likes, you'll love this book!"
5,Why didn't the nightengale sing?,"I won't re-hash all that's bben said. The reason to read this book is that it tells the story as the characters experience it, not from the omniscient,western viewpoint that's usual in historical fiction dealing with feudal Japan.If you like this genre you should also read ""Tale of Murasaki"", which is about Lady Murasaki who wrote ""Tale of Genji."""
4,A fictional world and era that will pull you in..,"I didn't know what to expect from this series, having picked it up in my local library without any prior knowledge of it, BUT.. I was pleasantly surprised! Lian Hearn pulls you into his fictional world from the moment you begin.. the characters and settings are wonderfully described and ""filled out."" I love a book that gives me no trouble at all constructing images and scenes in my head of what I am reading. Reading this series was like watching a movie! Hearn writes beautifully, and it was easy to imagine that I was right there with Tomasu the whole time! All in all, I really loved ""Across the Nightingale Floor,"" and I would certainly recommend it to anyone with an interest in Japanese cultures or history (even though the book is fictional in most regards)."
5,Fantastic,"After reading this novel, I was hooked. I then went and purchased all books in the series. This series is fantastic and very addictive. The writing is artistic and sensitive. Very very good!"
3,A hazy glimpse into a pseudo-Japan,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book for several months, being quite the enthusiast for feudal Japan. However, my expectations of an intense enmity between shrewd warlords soared far above the actual text. The story plods along at a decent pace, and the insight into Japanese culture and mythology (at least what little the author actually delved into) is fairly accurate, but the character development is plainly dull and the only reason I continued reading was to reach the epic climax of revenge, which itself didn't really live up to its own pretense.If you're looking for some hardcore samurai action interspersed with bits of philisophy and battle hardened wisdom, I suggest picking up Cloud of Sparrows by Takashi Matsuoka."
5,Stunning Fantasy with a Japanese Setting,"I love books with a Japanese setting, and Hearn's Otori trilogy are some of the best I've read.Her prose is simple, often sparse, but as beautiful as haiku. She evokes the atmosphere of feudal Japan with a minimum of words and with great skill.The best part about Hearn's writing is that it moves so quickly. There are no boring parts!Across the Nightingale Floor gripped me from the first page, not only because it was so beautifully written and interesting but because I really cared about the characters, who are all struggling to to the best they can in a harsh and demanding world.The following two books, Grass for His Pillow and Brilliance of the Moon are just as compelling and well-written as this book. I highly recommend the entire trilogy.If you like reading about traditional Japanese culture, you'll love these books!"
4,"very good, but nothing new","Very absorbing, impossible to put down, but ithas been done before, and done better. Great beachread."
3,overrated,"It took me four months to read this book because it never excited me. The world Hearn creates is alluring and beautiful, yet the plot seems amateur and void of any intriguing insight. Some of it was very poorly written and difficult to understand, despite it being a novel for young adults. The idea is great, but it gave me nothing to grab onto. Emotions are glossed over, the long awaited love scene is disappointing. It's not a bad book-the scenes conjured up are fun to imagine which is the book's strength, but the writing is mediocre, and the book really never takes off."
4,Engrossing,"If you liked Memories of a Geisha (a 5 star book) you'll probably enjoy the Tales of the Ortori series. Something for everyone - war/violence, love, internal moral struggles all set in ancient Japan. The story telling is vivid without being sentimental/corny. It surprised me that I liked the series (the books were a gift) I expected something more inline with a serial author, just cranking out trash for money."
3,A few great moments in an OK book,"This book was a quick, enjoyable read. Although it creates a medieval Japanese world and story reminiscent of James Clavell's Shogun (some of it seems directly copied from Clavell), this world contains magic and the story is a much lighter work. At times I really enjoyed the characters and the story. At other times I found it childish and simplistic. Unlike many American books (and movies/TV), many of the good-guys die so I liked that she included equal parts sacrifice, sorrow, and heroics. I enjoyed the story but not sure I would recommend it to adults or read more."
4,"Great Story, Hard to Put down","I truly enjoyed this first book in the Tales of the Otori. The story pulled me in and wouldn't let me go until I finished it in a relatively short time. I immediately started the second in the series and have just pre-ordered the third. It was enjoyable, engrossing and I thought the pacing of the story to be nearly perfect."
4,"Better Than ""Lord of the Rings""!","This book rocks! I don't typically read books like this -- a friend gave it to me -- and I couldn't put it down. Lian's exquisite storytelling and compelling characters really jumped off of the page.It's the story of young Takeo, who witnesses the slaughter of his family. He, too, is about to fall victim, when he is saved by the mysterious Lord Otori, who takes him in and teaches him his true calling.I can't wait until the movie; a ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for all ages is currently in the works."
3,"Borrowed from fact, fiction","This is a fantasy book, but it not fantasy from the authors imagination, rather it is heavily borrowed Japanese feudal times with a dose of magical powers thrown in for good measure. As well as the feudal structure which is more or less borrowed wholesale from pre seventeenth century Japan, there are 2 other groups at work within society, the Hidden, a group which allegorically represent the Christians of Japan during the seventeenth century; and the Tribe. The Tribe are the only true work of Ms Hearns fiction and are the ones in possession of the magic powers.The themes are those familliar to anyone who has read James Clavells Shogun series - loyalty, treachery, love. They are given the 21st century treatment with a feminist twist.I did enjoy the book, but it certainly isn't one I would rave on about to friends."
2,A tale set in a land of fantasy.,"The young Takeo is alone in a crowded world. His village has been destroyed by the Lord Iida Sadamu, his new father is Lord Otori Shigeru, enemy of Lord Iida, and it turns out the young man is a member of the Tribe - a group of assassins. Takeo's father was a member of the Tribe but left it for a new life. Now Takeo is trapped between the Tribe, his new clan and the danger he brings to them all by just being alive.The book didn't really grab my interest until I was at least 200 pages in which is not a good sign. While the setting seemed to be in Japan it isn't. While many of the names of the famlies anbd towns are Japanese sounding, most of the items are given normal names. A sword is a sword, a robe is a robe, tea is tea - you could replace many of the names and it could be set in China, Korea, England! Shogun this is not.Get it used if at all."
1,DONT DO IT,THIS IS NOT A SERIES ABOUT ASSASSINS.This is a bogus love story thats boring and sadly predictable.The 1st book is just tolerable enough to make one think that better stuff is to come.Its not coming.The sequels get progressively worse.You want an Assassin story check out B. Weeks or D. Morrell
1,Gives ancient Japan a bad Rep...,"Having an interest in anime/manga prompted me to get this book. It doesn't do the japanese justice however. Dont get me wrong, the story is interesting enough but I'm afraid the main chara ruins it.I read this long ago but I still recall coming to the conclusion that I wasted my time reading about someone whom I couldn't come to even remotely like.The end makes it clear that the common theme of good vs bad in most stories is butchered...seeing how our main chara is sexually perverted. The author tries to explain he simply has manly desires. Right. In the end, he finally gets to meet the girl he desires. Then he has sex with her. Hurray, I read the whole book so I could get to this. PLEASE, dont read this. I just wish this would have been exposed earlier on, so I didn't gag when I got near the end. -_-; We need a warning label on this..."
2,strange and disappointing,"(...) Some interesting ideas and some originality but within the first two pages you learn that the main character is bi-sexual, which for me was a major turn off and was difficult to ignore as the book moved on. Don't mean to sound homophobic but I would rather just not read about it.If that kind of stuff doesn't bother you or if you can ignore it it only comes up a couple times (albeit at very strange times) and you will probably find the book interesting."
2,Entertaining Read,"This was a different and entertaining read. it was also a ""Light"" read. the problems i had with this book was; the story really did not get interesting for me until i was half way through the book. Most trilogies or series of books that i have read have slow starts. This is compensated by the development of characters and the world in which the story takes place. IMHO, the character development was poor and there was virtually no development of world that this book takes place in. that is why i gave it 2 out of 5 stars. Otherwise, i would have given it 4 out of 5 stars. This is an entertaining book. my suggestion is to wait for the paperback or go to the library."
3,Takeos tales,"In this rivoting style feudal between action and love, takeo has many challenges ahead of him. The ""tribe"" the otori and of corse kaede are all part of his adventure through japan. After many encounters with the shadowy ""tribe"" Takeo discovers his true meaning, that he is a member of the ""tribe"" which is a deadly assain group who harness their powers for fighting mortal enemies, takeo then discovers his ability to turn invisibe, and make another replecar of him.The love of Takeo and kaede, was mislead and just not meant to be a love story but the twists and turns in his love set the perfect scene for two lovers.With a mixture of fantasy and gor, make this book a great tale for those who enjoy the suspense of a good action/fantasy thriller, if you like the mixture of good and evil then this book is worth purchaseing this book, ""across the nighingale floor"" and maybe the following cequils"
5,Great Job Lian Hearn,"Those of us who appreciate fantasy, and are fed up waiting for either George RR Martin to complete the next installment of ASOI&F; or the dross that passes for it today (witches,dragons,nasty people and a journey through blah, blah blah) can breathe a sigh of relief.Lian Hearn has composed a beautiful, poignant fable of love, honour,betrayel,bravery & loyalty. A fantasy story set in a not quite japan, though exquisitely detailed and reproduced. A cast of characters as good as anything created by Martin,Hobb,or dare i say it Tolkein. (gasp). The tale starts off slow but you find yourself unable to stop,suddenly you are are treading the singing floor, Jato sings in our hands and tears threaten to flow like rain down Shigeru's face.As satisfying read as i have had all year, a story that lingers in the memory, like a first kiss.OJNE FINAL POINT I disagree with some of the reviews here, (romance!...Clavell!...) if you need a comparison try Martin crossed with John Irving."
4,Enchanting entertainment,"One of the most entertaining novels I've read in a long time. Beautifully evocative of a magical time and place - a stunning fusion of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and James Clavell's ""Shogun."" It's refreshing to read an adventure story where the female characters are just as strong and capable as their male counterparts.I very much look forward to reading the next book in the series."
2,Good for an understanding,"This book is almost as old as I am, therefore, many of the P&C practices have change since. It's still a suitable piece of work for getting a general understanding."
4,It's very exciting!,"Our dauhter(two years old) is very favorite it. Every day we watch a 'play- along game & song' video and my daugher along the game. DaDaDa-Da.... She favorite song is 'i heard my dog bark' and it keeps her attention for the 30 minute and along the game and sing with dance along too. I like the video because of these game and songs theach rhymings, shapes, counting and more. Really this is a very nice video."
3,Impish Shostakovich in pretty good readings,"Though a noted pianist himself, Shostakovich did not exploit the instrument for virtuosic display--his two concertos are impish and light-fingered. Jazz and vaudeville bump noses with Haydn. The second cncerto, written for his son Maxim, age 19, is even saucier. The prominent trumpet part in the first concerto--here played too soberly and without pnache--is a leftover of Shostakovich's original intent to write a trumpet cncerto.A lack of panache flaws Mikhail Rudy's piano playing also. Although a favorite of Jansons', who used Rudy in his set of Rachmaninov concertos for EMI, this pianist never quite panned out: he is too sober-sided and lacking in imaginaiton. That doesn't kill these performances, but it doesn't help. The plainness of the usually infectious First Sym. makes me wonder if Shoshtakovich's humorous side just isn't suited to Jansons. Despite that, as a bargain release in excelent sound this one is recommendable, without relish."
5,The very essence of Alex Harvey is in this album.,"From ""Vambo"" to the warm and moving ""Hey"", this is truly Alex Harvey at his best. I'm grateful I live in Cleveland where Alex Harvey is still actually heard on the radio almost daily. Alex Harvey is who God would listen to if God had a radio,(and lived in Cleveland). The Swedes have a term for Alex Harvey's style, ""Vorgesetzler"". I think that says it best."
4,Do You Know?,"Michelle Williams has a unique, soulful voice that carries her sophomore release. While the previous album may have been mellow and understated, DO YOU KNOW is bold and exciting with a mixture of up-tempo selections (Purpose In Your Storm, The Movement) and powerful ballads (Title Track, 15 Minutes). If there is anyone who is going through a rough time, or questions whether God can change someone--this album is for you! DO YOU KNOW is simply a contemporary classic; Michelle successfully ministers about God's amazing love."
5,love this album so much,this is michelle best album it was very nice and smooth and also jazzy i give this album an A+ all day her first album was ok but this album is berrter then the first one.
4,Cool!,"First of all, the boat arrived in a timely fashion, was easy to assemble and looks neath. It performs very well, and I'm definitely the coolest captain in our lake. It has ok range and it really stands quite a bit of wind gusts. It is however a little less fun when there's less wind. The friction on the ropes prevents the sails from folding out and it is hard to get ""the most"" out of it. I'm working on some PTFE spray in order to reduce the friction.All in all a very satisfactory purchase!"
3,Fire Truck cake pan,I had bought this cakepan to make the cake for my son's first birthday party. I like the cake pan alot! Although I don't know when I will ever use it again. It came with the instructions on exactly how to make and decorate the cake. The only recommendation I have is buy red icing! I ended up having to buy red icing because the instructions to make your own ended up tasting horrible!
5,Soooooo Good,"Very good single with this song from a talented lady called Davina. The song still sounds fresh 11-12 years on after it was first released. If like me you had your special someone in 1997 and remember all the good times you spent and need to reminisce, this song is for you. My favorite track is number 3 featuring Xzibit as his lyrics are inspiring and ring true about relationships, i quote:"" I walked the Earth like Kane from Kung fu, to kick it with you, and all your people want to know what we do but i don't sweat it, it's good like credit, i put on the show like a gigolo so"""
5,Zombies!!!,This game is so versatile! You can play following the rules http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/fileadmin/downloads/zombies_se_rules.pdfYou can play it as an RPG http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/fileadmin/downloads/zombiesminirpg.pdfand so much more! http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/en/boardgames/zombies.htmlThere are a ton of expansions for the game and extra bags of zombies are very inexpensive.With endless possibility the game is hours of fun! I'm so please with this game I bought all the expansions so don't be surprised if you see a review from me on each of them. If you are a fan of zombies this game is a must have! The art is wonderful. The figures well made. Don't forget to buy extra zombies cause you will need them!
5,If you like having a great party board game with friends....,"This game is one of my favorites. It may looked complicated but it is very easy to pick up and play. It is kind of a mix between risk and settlers of catan. The great thing about this game, it isn't very long it can last from 20 minutes to an hour (longer if you put the helipad tile on the bottom). My friends love this game and even my family who has no interest in zombie movies or anything of the sort thinks it's a lot of fun."
4,Awesome game!,"Great board game. Very fun. The only issue is that some of the rules are poorly explained, so you'll have to work out a few ""house rules."""
4,nice,"Its just what i thought it would be. I like the game, found it, bought it, play it. enough said."
5,Damn Fun!,"This was probably one of the funnest board games around and it's different every time you play, especially since the maker's website has tons of rule variations to keep it fresh."
2,Not that great of a game.,"This game lacks that certain X factor that makes my gaming group continue with a title. I've now played three time at work over lunch and the game is simply less fun than other games we've played.Pros- It fits into an hour fairly easily if shuffle the helipad in with the other map tiles.- Zombies is simple and easy to learn.- The random map concept insures that each game will be different.Cons- game turn take to many steps to resolve.- The map tiles seem too thin, while the object card seem too thick.- The map doesn't lock together in any way.- There are lots of small pieces that are difficult to handle during game play."
2,Messy; Boring,"The game's mechanics are simple enough, which is the only compliment I really have. Turns take too long, and never accomplish very much. Half the cards are useless due to an overabundance of circumstances required to take the action and the other half are overpowered."
2,"Great potential, unrealized","I appreciate what the filmmaker is trying to do but it just wasn't done very well with this film. It has a few noteable scenes but don't get your hopes up too high (pun intended).Check out Kevin Booth's ""The Last White Hope: America's Drug War"". It's not a comedy but incredibly informative. Also, see ""Plan Columbia: Cashing-in on the Drug War Failure"" by Gerard Ungerman and Audrey Brohy."
1,Pan and Scanned...what a waste!,I was all set to buy this this morning until I saw on the packaging that it is pan and scanned. Sorry I absolutely will not fork over my bucks for a pan and scanned film no matter how much I like it. I love JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN but I despise pan and scan. They should have included two versions but obviously Disney only caters to one audience for some reason.
5,Great Movie,"This is a really great movie! We have been looking for it for some time and found it from a seller on Amazon, still new and unopened. We are very happy with our purchase!"
1,Walt would rotate in his grave.,"First I must say that thist shure is a 5 - Star Movie. My all - time Disney favorite.So I've been hoping for years that it might be released on DVD. But what do they do ? A copy-from-tape pan and scan version. Why, Oh Why ?Well, I've waited about 5 Years for the DVD now, so I might as well wait a few more for the widescreen version."
4,NATTY GANN,"it's been so long since i've seen this little movie but i still enjoyed it.a young girl going off after her father in depression unitedstates. being protected by a wolf and john cusak (one of his earlier movies) but he still put in a good performance a look of what's to come.the beautiful scenery,some action along the way,jumping on and off trains makes drama for the young one'sand what i call a clean script(no swearing)overall a nice family movie one to enjoy.the cuz"
1,"Movie began with this headline ""Can Not Play In Your Region""","Nowhere did the supplier indicate there was a ""Region"" requirement. It looks just like the movie that is appropriate for my region so how could I know I was purchasing something I would never be able to watch. You don't know until you open the movie, put it in your DVD player and then you find out you can't watch it because it does not fit your region?"
5,For teenage dreams and family fun don't miss Natty Gann,"A beautiful family feature . No one else could play the role of Natty Gann as well as Meredith Salenger did back in 1985 . I saw this movie when I was sixteen and I loved it . It is a story of separation , adventure , friendship , love and ultimately reunion . This movie also stars a nineteen-year-old John Cusack fresh from his role in Rob Reiner's "" The Sure Thing ."" The period settings and costumes are flawless . It makes one feel as though he or she has been whisked back to 1935 .It's Disney at its finest . A must see for preteens and teenagers! Don't miss this one!"
1,No Wide Screen Format Again and Again and Again!!!!,Disney Studios has done it again! They finally release a gem of a wonderful 5 star movie on DVD but selfishly release it in the fullscreen format of the 1.33:1 aspect ratio instead of the original 2.35:1 widescreen format. Missing is beautiful verdant cinematography of the Pacific northwest.Newer home theater systems and DVD players are meant to exploit new technology and not sent it back to the days of top load VHS players. Disney's arrogant approach shows they have no respect for the consumer and the buying public should not tolerate this attitude! - - A note to Roy Disney: I'm so sorry for the shoddy treatment given to this film; I believe your Uncle Walt would want this movie to be viewed the way it was filmed.**And why is this wonderful DVD available in its OAR of 2.35:1 in Region 2 Europe? Are we here in Region 1 North America not worthy of seeing our own films the way they were meant to be seen?
2,"a little gem- 2 stars for the dvd, 4 for the film","I recently saw this movie again on cable, and concur with other reviewers that the dvd is a waste of time. This movie is a rarity for family fare in that it is uncompromising and un-sappy. It treats the depression theme in a very mature way, but the journey itself transcnds what could be a very dark and somber mood throughout the movie. Interesting to me that it was all filmed no more than 15 km. from my neighbourhood in Vancouver . Seeing it for the second time 20 years later, I got to see a small slice of my past- the old train station, the law courts building, etc."
3,Another Worthy Effort,"THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN is another film I truly wanted to enjoy. The film's trailer is very appealing and enticing. It certainly looked like it was going to be a very emotionally charged movie. However, I was rather disappointed upon viewing it. The film has potential but it is very episodic in structure and lacks a strong narrative flow and character development that its story just yearns for. I came away disappointed and just filed it away as another worthy effort left unrealized."
1,Extremely disturbed viewers,"I have one question for the writing staff of this script...what was the age difference between Natty and Harry??? I was apalled by the romantic interlude which seemed to be between a 12 year old and a 18-19 year old. I was also extremely disturbed by the little bit in the car where the old man attempts to molest her. A family film, I think not."
1,Great Movie... terrible DVD...,"First off, this is one of the best family Disney films of all time. Great story, good acting, epic in scale.However, this DVD edition [bad]. Image quality [bad]. And it's not in widescreen, which is just a sin if you remember the scope of the film.Obviously, Disney's trying to find ways to cut corners these days and shell out low quality merchandise."
1,Terrible DVD of a fine film,This is one of the reasons to own a region-free DVD player. The British release of this film is in the original aspect ratio. I do indeed own such a player and have enjoyed this and other PAL editions of a variety of films.I second the dismay others feel that Disney often doesn't care enough about its own stuff to release it properly.
3,Leoncavallo,"OK for a first ever bio of an interesting composer. The main things that are missing are musical samples and lists and reviews of recordings. The language is a little strained, sometimes you have to go back to be sure you know what the author is talking about. Generally reads too much like a doctoral thesis. The author should read the composer bios written by Cairns, Budden and others."
2,"Beautiful, but...","... excepting ""Un coup de des"" by Barry Guy, the contempoprary pieces commissioned by this group sound less ""modern"" than the medieval music usually presented in other CDs by the same singers."
2,Didn't Last Very Long,"I have owned this chair for about 9 months. The seat bottom has flattened out and has torn a bit -- I can see the polyfill inside. It is not particularly comfortable anymore. The chair also creaks a lot (as is typical with most inexpensive chairs). It's a lot of money for a chair that has the build quality of one of the cheapie leather chairs that can be had for under $50.UPDATE: One armrest just broke in half. Unfortunately, the armrests hold the chair seat and back together, so this chair is toast. It received it July 18 (it is May 6 now), so it lasted less than 10 months. What a disappointment. I can't edit my rating and change it to one star..."
2,Low weight limit for a big and tall chair,This is a nice chair but has a very low weight limit to be classified a big and tall chair. Very misleading. I personally do not consider 250 lbs as big as that is my ideal weight. So buyer beware!
2,Not as shown in the ad,"does the job, i didnt get whats shown in the ad, mine was a straight one which cant be bent much and it also had screws! was too bulky for my laptop, picture transfer was ok. got the refund without any hassel from the seller."
1,Did not worK,PRODUCT TO WASTE YOUR MONEYIT DID NOT WORK FOR MEI TRIED TO EXTEND MY 6 FEET CABLE AND I DID NOT GET ANY SIGNAL
4,hdmi adaptor,"Very useful pieces for connecting your media with TV. If the adaptors were direction convertable, they would be lot better"
5,Works great!,"I'm using a DVI to HDMI cable so I can use my Sharp HDTV as a second computer monitor. The HDMI plug was loose and I was getting these awful green lines moving all over the screen. When I plugged it in through the port saver, my problem instantly went away. Now I have a perfectly clear 1080p picture!"
5,Exactly what I needed,"A tad shorter than I envisioned (although it clearly states the dimensions), but that actually worked out for me. Great product, great price."
4,HDMI Port Saver Cable,"Arrived on time and as advertised. I needed it for a crowded back panel with screwy connections, and it did the job."
1,NO.,Sad attempt at humor with a couple quick topless shots thrown in. Can't believe there are some good actors in this movie ie Christopher Meloni.
1,"A really bad, bad movie.","It was so bad, that I used fast forward through almost all of the movie. Normaly I do like National Lampoon's movies but this one was not even worth a one star, if it could have gotten less stars. I am not going into what it is about, for that you can read an other review. It is so bad, that you should spend youre time some where else that seeing this film."
2,Had Potential,"Theres a main feature with a bunch of little skits. The ""main feature"" as I call it is not bad, some pretty good acting. A couple of guys try to make a ""dirty movie"" meanwhile throughout the movie you see skits of dirty jokes. Some jokes are funny, others are down right offensive. The joke about the Priests, acne and 13 year olds....yeah many people may stop the movie after that one. It's funny in a sick, twisted, disgusting way. if you watch this movie please have an open mind. You will not enjoy it if you get offended by sex jokes.One more thing. Having kids smoke, talk about sex, drugs and killing and using profanity...I'd have to draw the line there."
1,Not Even Close...,"Not even close to being funny. Just downright boring and lame. I kept thinking and hoping it would get better, not so much... Don't waste your money or time with this one."
5,the best of the best,"In my opinion and that of my hairdresser, any BIOSILK product is the absolute best on the market. I have been usingit for years and it is unconditionally the best..........."
5,dvd review,My daughter absolutely loves this show and has asked for each season as they become available . They have all been great and delivery is so fast.
5,"A truly ""Outstanding Comedy Series""","It's a shame that P&R will not be able to win the award it truly deserves this year. Compared to any other show on television, well...there's no comparison. Every aspect of this show is phenomenal, from the ground up. Too many shows live off of generic plot devices, lazy sexual innuendos, and poorly drawn characters that get cheap laughs solely from being mean to each other. Not only does this show deliver rich characters and top-notch writing, it also does something tragically rare by romanticizing the smaller hometowns and life in the Midwest. And it's always funny and heartfelt. Season 4 was incredible, and it should be noted that I gave this 5 stars...despite having ZERO episode commentaries. Something that awful can only come from one place...the Library. PUNK-ASS BOOK JOCKEYS!"
4,"Funny, quirky episode","This is one episode where the multiple subplots going on actually adds to the entertainment. Funny and fast paced, it gives us just the right amount of face time with each of the main characters to keep the viewer engaged. Although it's not the most memorable episode, it is a nice and necessary addition to the fourth season."
2,Not very funny.,I'm not a big fan of lovers' quarrels which might be why I didn't like this episode. The plot is reminiscent of every other TV episode where an ex-boyfriend comes back. This is very derivative and no that engaging. I would recommend skipping it.
5,Vote for Knope,"""Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love."" Leslie Knope, best cast female character on TV. I wasn't sure about Parks & Rec when it first aired, but by season 1, episode 5 it was must see TV and has been pure gold ever since. Every character is fantastic! Ron Swanson!"
5,Non stop laughs,"Non stop laughs through the entirety of this show. Every season is great and the characters are well developed. As the show continues, it only gets better and better."
4,Continuing Strong,"Leslie's recent suspension from work forces her into relaxation for less than a day. At that point, Leslie can't take it anymore and decides to form a citizen action committee. Her new team, the Parks Committee of Pawnee (or PCP), starts to agitate and petition the government for park improvement.Another fun side story in this episode is the Christmas gift-giving within the Parks Department. As always, Leslie picks out wonderful, thoughtful gifts for everyone, so Ron tasks the entire office with thinking up the perfect gift for Leslie.Finally, poll results come back showing that Leslie's support for city council has fallen from 26% to 1%. The end of the show tracks Leslie's struggle with whether to drop out of the race or keep fighting."
5,God this show just gets funnier each season.,From just saw in this sneak peak. All three of the tammy explains so much about ron. Ever since i have heard about all three tammys in episode 4 of season 2. My first thought was that is going to be an amazing episode. Also leslie drunk off one shot of moonshine that will be just a joy to watch. I am really excited about crazy Entertainment 7/20 will be as well. Oh and to scent. I cannot wait to here the descriptions of what it smells like. Thank you amazon. I cannot wait for season 4. This is my favorite comdey on TV right now.
5,Solid episode with many funny moments,"This episode is an above average one since it is both entertaining and funny for the entire duration. It has a great theme with two rival scout groups camping near each other and both of their leaders believe their troop is the best. Also, since it is based heavily on Leslie and Ron (my two favorite characters on the show), I can watch it many times over and still not get bored. The only downside is it does not progress the city council storyline much, therefore it is not technically a must-see. However for any Parks fan, I highly recommend watching this episode."
3,A Basic Introduction,"For those interested in language ceolization, Understanding Jamaican Patois is a good description of the basics of the creole spoken in Jamaica. A relatively short book, it spends a good deal of time talking about orthography, which is always a problem/concern with a primarily oral language. This discussion is interestingly illustrated in the reading selection (a childhood tale by Llewellen ""Dada"" Adams) at the end of the book, which is written in facing pages in the two orthographies (one mixes phonetic and standard spellings; the second is purely phonetic). Ending the book is an all-too-short appendix comparing some similar features in Haitian and Jamaican patois."
2,never did receive it on Kindle,"Tried the sample on Kindle, then bought it. The purchased version was still the same as the sample. Eventually got my money back and tried to reorder, but it had disappeared. I will try again in future in case they have sorted it out. So my rating is not really based on the content so much as the experience to date. it doe elook like one f the better books on the subject."
5,It is a classic !,"These guys are hot like hell ! They show the world that they are not only one of the best producing teams....I already had the original (import) album since last year, now they released the new version. For me it is one of the best rap/hiphop albums ever, pure classic. Pharell is unbelievable !You will find some ""typical"" Neptunes beats (""Truth or dare"" with KELIS, ""Lapdance"") as well as folk-like beats (""Provider"").Personal favorites are ""Baby Doll"" and ""Am I high?"". My girl likes ""Tape you"" ..:-) BUY IT - you will love it."
5,Pretty good,"Ok, when I first heard their song ""rockstar"" I fell in love with them, I was a little nervous about buying their c.d. because I did't think I would like any of their other C.D.'s...however I bought it anyway's and LOVED it!! They have such a different sound to them! they rock! If you like rock and rap mixed together, you will love them!~L~"
3,Something very unexpected but good,"N.E.R.D AKA The Neptunes are the names of the hottest hip hop producers out there for the moment they have produced music for everyone from Jay-Z to Britney Spears, now finally Chad and Pharell decided to make a own record, some kind of project and actually it's not simluar to what they have been making for other artists, the funky beats are still there on some songs but they are making a rock/r&b album, 70's inspired but the beats make it original, a few song with good lyrics too. Lapdance and the anti war song Provider are the best with Rockstar, we got Kelis( caught out there) on ""Truth or dare"". ""Tape You"" is good aswell and includes some of the coolest beats on the album. Some songs are a little too slow for my taste, but the album is good, much better then i thought."
5,Fantastic,"I played this CD through several times a day for about two months when I first bought it. Virtually every song is great, especially Lapdance, Brain, Truth or Dare, Am I High and Rock Star. Hard driving hybrid of rap and punk, but hugely danceable, very funky. Lyrics are angry but quite intelligent. As a middleclass white guy pushing 40, I could totally relate to most of what they were talking about, unlike the other stuff that typifies most rap. Even preaches against drugs in a couple of songs, mom and dad will be happy to note. Highly recommended."
1,"Pharrell, stop singing.","If you enjoy an overwhelming ego ranting about how hot he is and how many girls he bangs and etc., then you'll enjoy this. You'll also appreciate it if you have no sense of quality music whatsoever. You 5-star reviewers must be smokin' something."
2,Still Nerds,"I'm sorry....this album is horrible. It sounds like a bunch of high schoolers got loose in the studio. I think I'm a very open-minded person, but to say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. .... Pharrell's voice may be fine for singing hooks, but it certainly cannot carry an entire album."
5,What an insult!,"I listen to all types of music, and very often become quickly bored of the mundane material put out by today's artists. This cd by the Neptunes however is the furthest thing from that. I have listened to this cd from beginning to end over and over again, and yet I don't grow tired of it at all. The range of skill and creativity of this group is unparalleled in mainstream music today. As for that reviewer, you might want to listen to this cd again without your happy little TRL playing in the background!"
5,THE BEST NEPTUNES ALBUM,"THEIR FIRST EFFORT TURNS OUT TO BE THEIR BEST EFFORT. THE NEPTUNES HAVE REINVENTED HIP-HOP AND PROVED TO USE HIP-HOP IS NOT DEAD AFTERALL. IF YOU LIKE THEIR BEATS CHECK OUT SOME OF THESE TRACKS ON THEIR FIRST ALBUM NERD IN SEARCH OF... ROCKSTAR,LAPDANCE, RUN FROM THE SUN, TAPE YOU, HELL ALL OF THESE TRACKS WILL WRATTLE YOUR SPEAKERS FROM DUSK TO DAWN. I BURN ALL MY MUSIC, BUT THIS RECORD I ACTUALLY BOUGHT. THEY SURE AS HELL WON'T RIP YOU OFF, THEIR BEATS ARE SO WIDELY PRODUCED, WHENEVER YOU HEAR THEIR SIGNATURE BEAT U KNOW DAMN IT GONNA BE OFF THE HEAZY. COP THIS SH*T BEFORE IT AINT HERE"
1,This album STINKS,"Except for one song, Run to the Sun, this album is awful. It is a redundant and repetitious set of nonsense. Save your money."
1,absolutely terrible - I would give it 0 stars if I could.,"This is honestly the worst cd I have heard in a long time. I believe these guys wrote this album not to make money - because I get the feeling they don't particularly care about money. There is not an iota of talent - lyrics, production, vocals - on this album. It is completely lacking. I get the sense this is a tongue-in-cheek cd, an elaborate ruse, an experiment to see who will buy this utter tripe. Sadly, I am a victim. My only consolation is that I realized it after track 3. Rockstar and Kelis' contribution to Truth or Dare are the only lights, however dim those light shine. Please save your money for something else, anything else. That sound you hear is the Neptunes, NERD, whatever, laughing all the way to the bank."
5,Magically Delicious,"I wasnt expecting much from this album. I figured that The Neptunes would fall under the category of ""producers who are better of as producers."" But then I gave this album and was happily surprised. First off, I wasnt expecting to hear real live instruments. I love hearing a real drummer as opposed to a drum machine. Secondly, I wansnt expecting to hear such an eclectic mix of styles (think Prince's ""Sign O' the Times, sort of). I did expect catchy hooks, and yes they are there. I'm glad a hip hop artist finally had the guts to make an album where the live instrumentation shines (sorry, but The Roots live band is always put back in the mix). What's old is new -- and The Neptunes bring back the old school flava to the 21st century. Buy this album!"
4,A Masterpiece,"This album is a true gem. A hip-hop/rock/funk hybrid that really works. This talented production team can do more than just make hits. They have crafted an album of pure bliss here. Lapdance is the obvious stand-out cut, but most of the album is brilliant. The live instruments really give it a classic feel and compliments the rapping nicely. Grab this for a breath of fresh air in the hip-hop world. Highly recommended."
3,N.E.R.D could have done way better!,"'In Search of...' has a few incredible tracks that make it worth buying, namely: ""Rock Star"", ""Truth or Dare"", ""Lapdance"" and ""Brain"". Add the excellent remix of ""Rock Star"" to the above list and you get 5 magnificent tracks with great beats so tight and original as only the Neptunes can produce (in addition come some excellent vocals). However, the rest of the album is pure pop and the vocals sound annoying (althought the beats are still great). For some reason or another NERD decided that their album should be dominated by Justin Timberlake-like vocals and lyrical content. Whatever the reason was, those tracks are boring and even annoying. Still, the smashing hits on it (as listed above) make it worth buying, but once again, it could have been much better on the overall!"
5,My Favorite Album Of All Time,"I am a Pharrell and Chad (The Neptunes) collector. And When I Heard The Tracks, They Blew Me Away. Am I High, Things Are Getting Better, and Run To The Sun are the songs to hear. Though They Are All Amazing, Those Are My Personal Favorites. Some Of The Critics Are Really Stupid Thinking This Album Isn't Great. Maybe You Don't Know Music. In Search Of... Is Definitely The Best."
5,Good band only under Mars Volta and Trail of dead,"For the most part i hate all rap because its not my preference. I hate the whole gold teeth thing..., but.......N.E.R.D is just an awsome exception to the rule. Pharrell has respect for the rock genre (not that I like most rock) and is not a hot shot. In Search of.. is just a kick ...cd that is only under the ""Deloused in the Comatorium"" disk by ""Mars Volta"" and ""Source Tags and Codes"" by ""And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead"". Although these are completely different genres of music, I feel that they belong together because they are experimental types of music."
2,"I Hate to naysay...but,","What happened? The Neptunes make tight R&B tracks and some hip-hop, but the album has tight beats, wack tracks. I would not pay for this album, a few good tracks, about 3-4. The rest is like...what? I bought this? Artists need to earn the money by making better ALBUMS not just a few songs. The Neptunes defintely fall in this area on this album."
4,"a little over-hyped, but still crosses genres","I'm mainly a rock fan, but when i heard all the hype about this CD being a mix, and crossing genre's, and being really good, i decided to give it a shot. And the CD plays more like a rap CD than anything else- obviously, as the only subject matter is mainly sex and drugs. And the first song ""Lapdance"" is very catchy and fun, there are about 3 or 4 songs that sound exactly like it on the CD. While NERD has definately created a style of its own, there isnt too much variety throughout the CD... similar sounding guitar riffs, drum beats, etc. I praise them for actually using real drums, something that most hip hop stars dont dare do. And i'm glad they have put some of the stars they produced (Kelis, etc) onto this CD to guest in a couple songs. But if you like rock OR rap, or just want somethign different, you will probably like this CD. The problem is, its not as good as it is hyped up to be."
3,Neptunes produce a sound really well.,"However, that sound is every song on this album. While every song is solid, when mixed as an album it gets boring. If your having a party you can piece this together in a mix and keep it going. However if your looking for the hip hop super producers to make the album that will change your life, this isn't the one."
4,Neptunes have some talent. Seriously though.,"This cd is cool. Ever since Pharell Williams of the Neptunes left Causin' Effect Entertainment, even though his beats were not as tight he did go more commercial which is good if you like that sort of thing. Im assuming that you do. This cd is tha shiznilty."
5,Great JSP Book for Beginners to Intermediates,"This book is a great book for beginners to intermediates. It is chalked full of real world examples. The book is very easy to follow and goes at a good pace. It does have a few spelling errors, but still a very good book. If you are looking for an intro book to learn JSP, this book is a great starting off point."
4,"Not bad, but not five stars either.","I will admit that the book does have some very good information on JSP. The code in the book is good, and the code does work for real life situations. However, this book was a tough read for me. I found that this book at times would drone on and on about some definitions that may or may not actually help you in the real world. In addition, I wish that it explained more adequately about setting up your Java environment for a Windows o/s. The book gives a very detailed installation on Unix, but virtually nothing for any Windows o/s, which to me is strange since most people have Win 95', 98' or NT. If you want to get snippets of code that will help you at the job, then this book is great. However, if you are new to JSP and trying to figure JSP out, or have a Windows box, then find another book."
1,Move along...,"I bought this book and found the first 3 chapters usable. They devote over 100 pages to Appendicies that aren't all the useful. The remaining chapters(beyond the first 3 or 4) are useful in gaining an understanding on how to attack business problems, but lack a real solution or 'good' code, which they even say themselves isn't what you would use in corporate life. Not even a good book ... Complete waste of $ in my opinion."
2,A good voice is not enough.,"Orlagh Fallon has a good voice, but is unable to convey the feelings and emotion of the lyrics. She sings as if she is reading the words and has no understanding of their meaning. Her renditions of She Moved Thro' The Fair and Carrickfergus are about as bland as I have heard. These songs have so much emotion, pain and passion to express, none of which I found on this CD. Like Enya's recordings, this is beautiful music but has no soul. If you are a lover of traditional Irish Music, this CD is not for you."
2,Not a great performance..,"I absolutely LOVE Orla in Celtic Woman, which is why I bought her personal CD - she's my favorite of all the women performing in CW. I was expecting more of the same.. her haunting vocals similar to Siuil a Ruin, Newgrange, and Harry's Game - but no. The entire CD is her and her harp, like on Inisfree from CW - BORING. It's more fit as a CD of children's lullabys then anything for an adult."
1,Please give us something new,BORING!!! Why are these girls all hacking out the same tunes with the same emotionless sound.
5,Music to sooth the soul,"I have had this CD for awhile now. I'm seriously considering buying more copies. One for the car, one for the house, one as a backup. I listen to this CD very often. And if life is getting crazy and I'm needing a break from it all, the incredible music of Orla Fallon is just the ticket.Orla has a wonderfully unique alto voice that just soothes my soul when I hear her sing. Orla's harp playing is also masterful. As a harpist who's only played for a little over two years, I know just enough to understand how difficult this instrument is. Orla is incredibly talented. And to be able to play this instrument AND sing at the same time? Beyond my personal comprehension! I have been blessed to see her perform in person a few times; she is the real deal!If you are looking for a soothing CD to take you back to old traditional Ireland, it doesn't get better than The Water Is Wide."
5,Delightfully charming,"Having first encountered Orla Fallon through her work with Celtic Woman, I began to explore her solo work and was enchanted. She has become one of my favorite artists. I have three of her albums at this point and am not disappointed with a single one. Her voice transports me to the shores of Ireland and soothes both heart and mind. I particularly enjoy the songs such as Carrickfergus in which she both sings and plays the harp so beautifully."
4,Another Celtic Woman buy product,Orla has done a great job with the songs on this CD. She was an excellant choice for the Celtic Woman's beginning.
3,"Pleasant, but not special","This is a lovely album of pleasant and peaceful Celtic harp. Orla Fallon has a beautiful voice and the things she does with a harp are interesting and unique. However, there isn't much variation from track to track. The melodies are all good and it makes for perfect background music, but the instrumentation is just too minimalist to make the album a listening experience in and of itself. Siúil A Rún is by far the best track, with beautiful vocals, melody, AND the best depth of instrumentation. It's clear that the most effort and care was put into that track, as it stands out quite a bit from the others.All in all, if you like Celtic music and you like what you hear from the album samples, then you can make this purchase with peace of mind that you're getting something wonderful, if not exactly special.-Arvis"
4,Brilliant hard-edged rock,"Shihad are the masters of riff-driven rock. This album isn't their best (check out their second album 'Killjoy'), but still shows off their superb skill at combining monster riffs with great melodies. Tom Larkin's drumming is always a joy to listen to, and the rest of the band continue to evolve their sounds into new areas. Great!"
1,"Weak plot, relationship of Jane Bee to Queen unrealistic.","Much weaker plot than the first book in this series, which was quite ""amusing."" The author includes heaps of unnecessary comments, Brit jargon, meaningless yakkety-yak which distracts the reader. I am now reading #3 inthe series, Death at Windsor, with hope....."
1,Not All The Songs,"This was such a let down. I thought it would have all the great songs that were in the movie, but they were not."
4,O.K but could of been better,"This is a great CD, i love both songs from Robbie Williams, Out of reach from Gabrielle, and that song a pretender got my heart. love the songs from Shelby Lynn and of course love the score at the end and even the cover of Someone like you by Dina Caroll. The only thing i could complain about is half of the coolest songs on the movie is not on the soundtrack (ie..respect Aretha Franklin, Artful Dodger..ect) but if you can overlook that than this is an execellent CD, if not well you can always order the imported version which you will find all the tracks missing that you wish should of been there(the U.K version has 5 more tracks)."
4,good fun,"For a soundtrack this is good. It captures the essence of the film perfectly, and is just very ligh-hearted and fun.I'm not going to pick it apart, because it all depends on what you're looking for.Don't expect anything ground-breaking, it just feautures music that most romantic comedies usually have. There's a good mix of golden-""oldies"", and new songs I'm sure you haven't heard before. There is some great, some good, some ok, and some bad, but the all around feeling you get after you're done with this soundtrack is good. It's very feel-goood, and great to relax to,and sing along to.Just get in the tub, light some candles and chill!BTW, the movie kicks a$%,and if you haven't seen it yet, I reccomend you do so."
4,a different soundtrack,"from what i see, my bridget jones soundtrack has a different listing and a different sequence! i wonder why that is so? i think the ones added to my soundtrack is aaron soul's ring ring ring (huh, who's this?) and aretha's respect, but i don't have tracy bonham's song.anyway, i didn't like all the songs, but i loved the album. i guess it's because the tracks chosen reminds me of the movie, like respect, which was prominent in one of the key scenes. and the songs leave me feeling for bridget. most of all, it's great for relaxing at the end of the day. just humming along to stop look, and listen soothes me.btw, is there really a bridget jones soundtrack part 2? i saw something on a lyrics website. it includes my preferred version of ""someone like you"" (by van morrison) and an acoustic version of out of reach. hmmm."
3,they missed some great jazz tunes,"all i wanted to say is that they left out some great tunes i heard in the movie, both by jazz singer Astrud Gilberto, who has a lovely, sensuous, and very feminine voice. i heard ""Agua de Beber"", and i think i also heard ""the girl from Ipanema"" [i'm not sure about this one]. these tunes were played in the background while bridget was at her parents' house."
4,Very good CD,"I actually enjoyed this CD a lot, especially the song ""Out of Reach"" by Gabarielle. The whole album contains mostly slow songs, some are kind of sad. It sort of give you the mood when you just want to be alone and sad."
2,IT'S AN OKAY CD,"To tell the truth, I completely disagree with the main review I just read on this CD. I agree with you lot who say that Geri's song is the best on the track! I am a huge Spice Girls fan as well as a Geri Halliwell fan and this song is definitely the only GOOD thing to happen on the album! The other songs are okay, Chaka Khan's and Rosey's are pretty good. Robbie William's are okay but I like his own songs on his albums much more than the ones on this CD. Yeah, Sheryl Crow's song stinks, it is way too much like all her other ones. Geri Halliwell rocks the soundtrack though, she's the reason I bought it and the only reason I put up with the rest of the songs chosen for the movie!!! GO GERI! GO SPICE!"
2,Where's Van Morrison,"Let's be honest about this, Morrison was featured twice in the film singing,""Someone Like You"" and no where on the sound track.He was featured twice because his performance is great... which this sound track is not.. It does show up on an old John Candy film from a few years back.. good luck finding it."
3,Bridget Jones's Diary Soundtrack,"Not truly a soundtrack more the essence! Whatever happened to The Pretenders, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", and that song that began ""I feel fantastic, bombastic..."" that was a high point, but sadly not here!Still I take the Robbie Williams tracks and Chaka Khan...but the rest seem to be fillers...not easy to pinpoint their place in the movie!As another reviewer emphasized, check the track listing before you part with your dosh!"
3,Bridget Jones Diary soundtrack cd,"Ok, I guess. Worth checking out for the Shelby Lynn tracks (Dreamsome, Killin Kind) and the Sheryl Crow trackThe odd song gives me a headache, but put Dreamsome on repeat"
3,An OK soundtrack to a GREAT Movie!,"I loved this movie and bought the soundtrack hoping to ""keep the feeling going"". I am not a Van Morrison fan and I don't even know if I have heard that version of the ""Someone Like You"" song. I didn't particularly care for it on this soundtrack. However, I love track #9 called ""Out of Reach"". It is a slow song that is pretty. I also like track #1 and #2 (look who sings them...tells the story). I also like track #4 which is a Frank Sinatra/Dean Martin type song. The rest of the sound track is ok. My boyfriend prefers to call it elevator music, but it is relaxing and harmonious. I can't help but say I was disappointed with the music but at least I found some enjoyment from it."
3,man this cd hecka bit off of the someone like you soundtrack,"i personally prefer the someone like you soundtrack better than this one, mostly because that one has the van morrison version of ""someone like you"", which is probably the best song in BOTH mvoies! i watched both movies on the same week, and the music was practically the same! they both had someone like you, and dreamsome by shelby lynn. they're both extremely good songs. but man...if you were to get this cd you should get out someone like you first."
3,Pretty good but....,"I was really looking forward to this CD when I saw the movie. Unfortunately, I am not as pleased with the soundtrack as I was hearing the songs in the movie. The most obvious reason for this is that the song ""Someone Like You"", such a wonderful part of the movie, is not sung by Van Morrison on the CD. His exquisite voice would have added a great deal to the CD, which is pretty good but lacks a lot of the depth and emotion the original artists gave many of these songs."
3,the song,the song from the market that a few people have asked about is by artful dodger and craig david- its called woman trouble
3,Great Movie with great songs -Why not a great soundtrack?,"The movie had great scenes that tied into the music beautifully. ""Respect"" and ""Aint no Mountain High Enough"" were two of those songs and do not appear on the CD. Record companies need to get their act together and realize that sales will improve if they remain TRUE to the movie soundtrack. Please don't give us the line about ""contractual"" restrictions. If that is the case.....don't use the songs. Shelby and Sheryl do a fine job with the tracks they sing...."
5,Very pleased with service.,Shopped all over for this CD for a gift and found it here for half the price! 5 Stars!!!! Fast Shipping and awesome price!
3,If you're looking for Van Morrison....,"His rendition of ""Someone like you"" is on the soundtrack for the film ""Someone Like You""."
3,All-in-all it's a good listen,"However, a couple of songs that are included on the British version of this CD should have been included with this release as well. ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" added a lot of character to the film but isn't on the American CD. Also, The Pretender's ""Don't Get Me Wrong"" is a fantastic song that was perfect for the film, however, did not make it to this soundtrack.I should have purchased the British version of Bridget Jones's Diary [SOUNDTRACK] and would have been happier. You won't be dissappointed with that purchase."
2,Not enough songs! Where's Ain't No Mountain...,"I guess it would take a two-CD package to get all the songs used in the film--but of all things to exclude, why Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" which is used twice at critical moments towards and at the end?? A real diappointment. Other soundtracks I know have been offered in two editions--abridged and full selections--why not this?"
3,And the best track is....,"Well to be honest I'm an avid fan of Geri Halliwell, so I might be a bit biast. Geri Halliwell's cover of the '80's song is the best track on the entire album. Robbie Williams, Garielle, Dina Carroll, and Alisha's Attic come in closely behind. Sheryl Crow is absolutely awful on the 'Kiss That Girl' track. There are few light points that are upbeat and make your blood pump, and these belong to Miss Halliwell and Chaka Khan. The bottom line as I see it is wait for Geri Halliwell's single to come out at the end of April."
3,No regrets despite no Van,"Although I basically enjoyed this soundtrack, it has some glaring omissions. Van Morrison's ""Someone Like You"" was THE song of this movie, yet the rendition on the soundtrack is by a female vocalist. If you want Van, as I did, you can find him on the soundtrack of the movie appropriately entitled Someone Like You starring Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear. Also missing were the background renditions of You're Just Too Good to Be True (at the opening Turkey Curry Buffet), the Supremes' Ain't No Mountain High Enough and Aretha's Respect. What were the soundtrack folks thinking? Just as another reviewer, I too missed the upbeat song that served as background music for Bridget's pre-blue soup dinner stroll through the outdoor veggie markets. Oh well, there are still some very good tracks here, so I don't regret purchasing it."
1,Nothing new here...,"Pretty cheesy formulaic soundtrack.I guess they couldn't put out all the songs that were featured in amovie on 1 cd, but at least it could be a little more more balanced.But this feels more like some ""oldies-mellow-country"" type radioprogramming. It's got no spice.What's happened to that cool funky Craig David's ""I feel fantastic, bombastic ecstatic..."" song featured in the ""cooking blue string soup""dinner scene. I had to search internet for the song's info, it wasn't evenin the film's credits."
2,"Forget raining men, this is foggy.","Well, ok, its a decent enough soundtrack but correct me if I'm wrong....this wasn't a decent film, it was fantastic!! So why isn't the soundtrack fantastic too? Because some of the songs from the film weren't put on it and the original artists like Van Morisson weren't used either. Firstly, where is ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" which appeared twice in the film? Also Aretha Franklin's ""R.E.S.P.E.C.T"" or The Artful Dodger's ""Woman Trouble""? The fact is that some of the best songs aren't on this, however, there are still some great classics on here like ""All By Myself"". Its just a shame really because this could have been an amazing soundtrack to top off this year's funniest film."
2,This CD did not do the movie justice!,"I saw the movie, loved it, loved the music and rushed out and just had to have the soundtrack. I got it home, turned it on and it was horrible. I loved the song, Someone Like You, but on the soundtrack it was done by Dina Carroll, not the man who did it in the movie. It was a letdown after hearing the great music in the movie to listening to this soundtrack. If anyone wants it...Don't buy it! Maybe you can copy somone else's! Wait for the movie and just buy that!"
3,If you're looking for Van Morrison...,"Don't look for him on a movie soundtrack. Buy his excellent 1987 cd, ""Poetic Champions Compose"". ""Someone Like You"" is track #7 on that cd. I just saw the movie today, and am shocked that Van's song is not included on the cd. It's clearly the most important song in the movie, and is played twice! That is a very special song to me, as it was me and my husband's first song that we danced to at our wedding reception 9 years ago!"
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased the CD sound track to the motion picture Bridget Jones's Diary because one particular sound track stood out. The song was sung by Van Morrison in the film entitled ""Someone Like You"". However when I purchased the CD the song was sung by Dina Carroll. Needless to say I was truly disappointed and feel cheated. In my opinion a CD should be sold as it is recorded by the same artist in the movie or at least some mention should be made that a different singer has recorded the song on the CD giving an individual the option to purchase!!Disillusioned Purchaser. Jene"
3,Not quite cricket,"Okay, the truth is the Shelby Lynn songs alone make this cd worth having, but something fishy is going on here. Van Morrison's master piece is replaced by a far inferior version. And there are songs in the film not on the cd, and songs on the cd not in the film! This alone makes it criminal to both music and film lovers. Are we supporting something ugly here? Too bad because with all of the true songs from the film this would have been a must have item for every person on the planet. D"
2,Short-lived,"This dvd player worked fine for three months of minimal use, but suddenly stopped working. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,So glad I found it again!,"I had my Trutech for over two years and it was just fine. I think for such a cheap and little (my space was limited) dvd player it had a good long life with no problems until the very end. I went back to Target where I had purchased it and they had a different bigger more expensive Trutech that didn't have the same features I had grown to love in the older one. It was bigger, more expensive, with less features and then it just didn't work! I'm so glad I found my old friend here, since Target was dumb enough to stop carrying it. I'm told that because these little guys are so much cheaper than other brands that the quality control isn't that great (1 out of 10 won't work properly) I'm willing to roll the dice with this model."
4,Pretty good player!,When I bought this player it worked flawless up till about a year when it started to act up and not read certain discs. Having a bit of electronics background I decided to investigate. I found that a capacitor on the power supply that was underated 10V 1000uF capacitor in a 12V circuit which had swelled up and leaked its gunk out. After replacing it with a higher voltage rated capacitor of the same value the player worked flawlessly and had improved speed on reading discs. I got a feeling that this capacitor was put into place to purposely fail down the road to make the consumer buy a new one.... well i'm not going to be one of them. This players great since the repair. The one thing I don't like about it in general is the remote (layout of buttons) but otherwise its a pretty nice player for the price.
1,Piece of junk,"So what if it's cheap? If it doesn't play anything, even a cent would be too much. Straight out of the box this player was skipping and stalling on every DVD I tried. I'm returning it today. Don't waste your money."
1,I agree not even worth 1 star,"This product worked perfectly to play 3 movies on the fourth movie it froze and I had to restart three times, the fifth movie never played after over 10 tries to load I kept getting the No Disk message. I then went back and played two of the other DVDS that had played last on this same player perfectly and these too resulted in a No Disk message. Yet my computer plays all of these perfectly. Now 2 months and 4 movies later I am out the $30!"
1,Junk,"I bought this thinking a DVD player was a pretty simple device, so a cheap one ought to work. No. This is total junk, out of the box. First it skipped, then it finally tracked, now it only shows black and white. Really, truly, a waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,Has to be the worst DVD player on the market.It skips and blurs like no other.Please do not waste your money on this piece of ****.Buy another brand.KJ
1,Component output does not work,"I bought this DVD player at Target to replace my JWIN DVD player which stopped working after two years. The price for the DVD player was 30 dollars, and very compact. However, I got no signal when I connected my TV to its component output. I have been using component output from my JWIN player, so my cable has to be good. I was able to get signal from the RCA output. The next thing was that the player kept freezing while playing my home made movie on DVD-R. So if you want to use component output, want to play on DVD-R, reconsider. I returned to Target store."
4,No Problems Whatsoever.,"I got disgusted after my rather expensive DVD player broke down so I ended up going out and buying this--super cheap!--model. I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. It's barebones but it has a counter which is the only extra feature that I use regularly. It's rather small too so it fits comfortably atop my television, and I balance my cable box on top of it. Why pay more for something if you don't have to? It's been reliable so far and given me zero problems."
5,Great value,"Some other reviewers seem to have had very negative experiences with this product. I, on the other hand, am quite impressed with it. I paid $30 for this DVD player almost 2 years ago. I had no problems until just recently. It is broken now, but I tend to think the 2 years of hassle-free DVD playing was more than worth the $30. This is not a high end machine, and it won't last forever, but consider that it is an advanced piece of technology for less than the average bar tab. It worked well for a long time and I have no complaints."
1,Don't buy it!!!!,"This is the worst dvd player in the world. A friend bought it for me at Target. Within a month, it stopped working. Actually it won't read any discs. Spend the extra money and get something else. This shouldn't be on the market."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Unfortunately, it's not really worth one star. Go the extra mile and buy a better brand. In the end, you'll save time and money. I've bought not one but two of these cute little compacts and they worked great out of the box, initially. In the end they both stopped operating; the first one within a month and the second one lasted about three months."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,NO STARS. Played fine at first but after several months won't load disc at all. Total Garbage.
2,"Save your money, buy something else","I bought this player at Target because it was the cheapest around and I needed to replace a DVD player that was having lots of problems.At first this player worked great, but within a month it started having problems with freezing up, at first I thought it was the DVD...Now a little over a month later, it skips, freezes, and simply turns itself off while trying to ""load"" a DVD or in the middle of playing one.This player is going where it belongs, in the garbage!"
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for,"Bought this for my Father on Christmas. Ran into a number of issues1) This device does not want to start up with Component Progressive scan. If you attempt to power on the device with only Component cables connected, you get a black screen. You have to hit the 'Progressive' button on the remote every time you power up.2) So far, we've had a 50% success rate playing rented movies on this player. On the movies it has problems with, the problem seems to be in the middle when the device is switching layers on the DVD. The rest of the problems were with the player not handling scratches and smudges well."
1,Don't buy tru tech,This item will last about 15 plays....number to customer service only rings and rings...no website available for help. Google tru tech to read only horror stories. I googled to find a manual as after 15 plays I have only audio...no picture...just blue screen. Nowhere for help. I guess my own fault for only paying 30 bucks.
5,I love them!,"And so does my daughter. She got these for Christmas, and they are stunning! Excellent purchase, and I'm thinking about getting me a pair of my own."
5,Very pretty,"I ordered these as a gift for an 11-year-old girl who is not permitted to wear large earrings. Though they're not blue (the blue hue in the picture is most likely the result of iridescence; the cubes are clear, traditional crystal) they're cute. They do measure an inch in length; however, this is outstretched from the tip of the post to the finishing bead beneath the cube. The dangling portion--cube and all--is 5/8 inches, and the cube itself is a little under 1/4 of an inch; the metal rings are the remaining 3/8. They're very dainty, very pretty, and at a very reasonable price. Would recommend."
5,A Fresh Blend,"This book was great! It gave me a lot of insight and helpful information that all led back to the Source - God. I married 3 years ago with 3 children of my own to a man with 3 teenage children and we now have 1 together. I deal with many of these issues: finances, in-laws, exes and the children (teens), so it was a true blessing to know I am not alone and that blended families can succeed."
2,Disappointing,"First, I must admit that I am probably a failure as a parent. My x and I never disciplined our oldest daughter. To diffuse her frustrations and hostilities, we acquiesced to her every wish (ipod, computers, smart phones, body piercings, dropping out of high school).The theme of this book is to let your teenager do whatever they want. I did that for the first 14 years and it didn't work."
4,good tips,A great starter for helping you understand your teens. Had some good tips and helpful insight. Did feel it was worth the time and money.
5,"If you have a teen, get this book now!","I have been through teen hell over the past two years, and I was extremely frustrated that none of the social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, teachers, or other parents could tell me what to do to attempt to get through this. They were great at telling me why it was happening, though. Michael Bradley not only tells you why it is happening, but tells you very clearly what to do. Get the book, and make your spouse read it, too."
5,A lifesaver!,"Other reviewers have said what needs to be said about this book, so I just wanted to add my 5-star rating to the chorus. Even if your teen is not as extreme as some of the clinical examples related here, this book goes a long way toward explaining teen behavior. Reassuring, witty, and blunt, the message is that teens will internalize the loving messages from parents, even if delivered imperfectly and received with barely disguised scorn. Our main job is to build a teen's identity and help them make better choices in a society that presents way too many alluring traps for young people."
3,Good info,"I love to read. This book has good information, but more scientific. If you are a stressed out parent sometimes the science is not want you want to read at that moment. It will put you to sleep."
1,horrible,"Helped me...hmm...not at all? Don't buy, it describes teenagers too generally.---A not too confused parent"
5,Brains like ours...,"I read Bradley's books ""Yes Your Teen is Crazy"" and ""Yes Your Parents are Crazy"", when researching my own book ""The Owner's Guide to the Teenage Brain"". ""Yes Your Parents are Crazy"" is one of the few books on teenage brains addressed to the teenagers themselves (like ""The Owner's Guide to the Teenage Brain"") as most are addressed to exasperated parents. Both books provide knowledge about what is happening in these important years, and as a pair, allow kids and parents to read about the changes in partnership -you could do this in some kind of pact to reduce tensions in your relationships.Recommended.Derek Pugh"
5,I liked this one best,I ordered 3 books on this subject. The writing is the most smooth to read. To me its written in an entertaining manner. It deals with a sensitive turbulent time in a child's life. I liked how it explains how to give them room and now to react in a manner that heightens the situation. Makes one realize just how many factors a teen has to deal with. Its really helped me back off and realize that trying to control a teen can make them crazy. But to give them the room and let them hopefully come to the right decision will help them to become a more responsible adult. To let them fall on their own faces sometimes also makes for a learning experience that may make more of an impression than if their parents are always saving them. I really like this book.
5,A must-read book for parents of teens!,"I have never written a review on a book, but everyone out there needs to know how amazing and right-on this book is. The author explains & clarifies so much about our kids and what is going on in their head and in their world. It will suck you in and give you an amazing, eye-opening understanding of what teenagers are all about and the skills to make things better in your relationship with them. Help is here, seriously!"
5,"I knew it, I knew it!!","My daughter is just getting into her teens, and this book is just what I needed to understand what she(and I) are going through. I used to just think teens were intentionally being difficult and that MTV and society were to blame. Now that I understand them better, I can say ""bring on the crazyness."" This book will be a tremendous help to me and a lot of parents."
5,Sane Counsel,"The humor and advice in this book are practical, inspiring and somewhat surprising. As a step-parent, it really helped illustrate how my step-daughters perceive my relationship with them and their biological parent. Though it sometimes seemed to promote a model that is too lenient, putting its counsel into practice has returned some sanity to our home.Dr. Bradley's experience, intellect and compassion are equally evident in these pages, and his insights into the adolescent psyche rang true as I recalled how I once looked at the world and my own parents so many years ago. That said, I noticed his companion book, ""Yes, Your Parents Are Crazy"" so he's clearly working both sides of the street! I'll leave it up to my kids to read that one."
5,Life-altering help,"I have read many books on raising children and teens, but this one is by far the most helpful. I was having nightly fights with my 14-year old son about homework, chores, and computer use, and our relationship was not a source of anything positive for either of us. After reading this book, I learned the importance of developing bilateral respect, putting the relationship first, and realizing that this phase is temporary. We still have fights, but maybe once or twice a month and we now know how to resolve them. I am enjoying my son's company again and feel much closer to him. He is more cooperative and helpful as well. I will be giving a copy of this book to all my friends who have children entering their teen years with advice to read it while they think they'll never need it, and again when they know they do."
5,Helpful and funny,"Particularly love the writing style. Very self-effacing and engaging. He offers great advice for responding to the ""crazy"" behavior that teens exhibit. Bought this copy for my husband so he could read it as I didn't want to part with mine!"
4,Classic West Coast Hip Hop,"With some great beats and even better rhymes this album is one of my favorite, classic, LA based Hip hop albums. Don't sleep on this one if you like that clean west coast hip hop sound. Lot's of guest appearances also add to this albums great mix of sound."
1,do not buy this,this is by far the worst cd ever made the whole likwit crew blows chunks and sucks b*lls. J-ro E-swift and tash are fa**ots.
5,classic party album,"I gave this album a perfect score because I felt that it had to be judged within its genre: party music, and in that sense it really is perfect. This isn't ""conscious"" or political hip-hop, but the beats are ridiculously hot, the lyrics are fun and the emcees mesh perfectly. As a party album this is right up there with some of Redman's best work (Tash in particular has a braggadocious style reminiscent of Redman, and they definitely do here for the 40 what Reggie Noble did for the blunt). This represents some of the best that the West Coast has to offer, and it is the perfect album to crack a 40 to."
5,Good sleep aid,"Melatonin by itself can cause bad dreams. This formula really works with no side effects, and it is not additive. You can use it without any pill ""hangover""."
1,Just about as exciting as a ham sandwich ....,"OK .. we have a young budding artist living in NY, working as a waitress in a slop shop, and for some reason, becomes the focus of attention of Alex, a wealthy, but of course sleazy, patron and art dealer.......Up to this point the story has potential but when one starts to read this book falls appart .... I think that Carla needs some pretty serious psychologcal help .. on the one side she 'gets it on' with the whole crew of a downtown fire station, and then on the other side, being 'church mouse' poor she won't get together with a wealthy and good looking man that can make the word happen for her. While were at it what with her and the hots for a homeless bum that is told not to come back to the slop shop, mistakenly called a restaurant .....I would reccomend this to anyone who has a fireman fixation but that has to be about the only good thing I can say ...."
4,Opportunities in Travel Careers,"This book has good information, most still substantial to the current industry. Some of the information is a bit outdated now. Overall, good for resources and research."
1,Don't waste your time,"Reading this book felt like reading a cheap and very poorly written romance novel complete with silly characters, unbelievable situations and painfully predictable plot lines. Nevertheless, it managed to hold my interest for the first half or so (kind of like gawking at a train wreck). Then, suddenly bored and fed up with the ridiculous characters and plot, I skipped to the last chapter, thought what a stupid ending and put the book away. Don't bother with this one--there are too many GOOD books out there to read."
1,Grrr,"The only reason I kept turning the pages was that I was fascinated by how bad the book was. And as a great admirer of the work of the author of Thornbirds, and even Tim; I was exciting about the possiblities of a new novel written by the same author. But alas, either the books are written by different people, or Mrs. McCullough had a contact to fulfill and not enough inspiration and time to develop a good yarn. The book is simple, predictable, uninspired and ""redolent"" of yuck!"
2,uninspired writing,"After starting two times to read this book I managed to get through it all, just! I find it hard to believe the same author that penned the remarkable, ""Thorn Birds"", also wrote this tedious and dreary novel. Although the Historical content of ""The Touch"" is interesting (although rather long winded) and seems accurate, the character development is flawed. None of the characters are very likable, and all seem rather inconsistent. The author gives us no real reason to understand why they do the things they do. In fact, many of the characters and their personalities are just plain unbelievable. I don't think the characters fit very well into the time period that Mrs. Mccullough has written about. I found this book very unsatisfying, and it was a real trial to finish it. Without giving anything away, the ending was very disappointing, and did not seem in character."
1,Big Disappointment,"I love The Thorn Birds and have re-read it many times, but this book is nothing like it. The characters are shallow and unbelievable, their actions incomprehensible. They all seemed like stereotypes recycled from any of dozens of bad romance novels. It was a real chore to finish."
4,good book,"I enjoyed yet another book by Colleen McCullough,Hopefully she can produce some more good reads in the near future for everyones enjoyment"
2,Failed to Touch Me,"This book certainly had me turning pages to find out what would happen, but it was ultimately disappointing. It had none of the richly-drawn characters that made The Thorn Birds such absorbing reading, and the plot was laughable in places. Alexander's decision in particular was facile, unbelievable and totally out of keeping with his (entirely one-dimensional) personality. The Nell character is clearly borrowed from Justine (Thorn Birds) and we are given absolutely no insight in to why two of the key characters fall in love - it appears to be entirely superficial because they have no more than four or five conversations before running off to live happily ever after. I really get the impression she just did this for the money."
2,A big disappointment,"I had read (and loved) the Thorn Birds years ago, so I had great expectations for this book. Although the story starts out with an interesting premise, I could not relate to one character in the story. They all seemed unbelievable, more like cartoon characters than real people, with a story as boring as a bad soap opera. It was very tough to finish it, I kept hoping for some clever or surprising development, but it was a disappointment right to the end."
2,A Disappointment,"As an avid fan of THE THORN BIRDS, I guess I was hoping for too much when I purchased and read this novel. All I can say is that it was a disappointment. There was far too much detail about steam engines and gold mining, and not nearly enough detail about interpersonal relationships. Some parts of the book were quite unbelievable, such as Alex traveling all over the world (literally)as a very young man in the 1800's. I am not at all sure that is realistic. Also, the ending was horribly predictable and again, unrealistic. This could have been SO much better. I've decided to give up on Ms. McCullough's novels in the future... Yet it was not a total waste of time, there were parts that were quite interesting and readable. On the whole however, a disappointment."
5,"Price Pfister 0264NCC Marielle Single-Handle Kitchen Faucet with Side Sprayer and Soap Dispenser, Chrome",I highly recommend this excellent item. Purchased TWO for our 2 separated built-in kitchen sinks. We returned from this seller only because = Found the exact same product at a lower price elsewhere. We've had them for over 1 year & they're still beautiful.
1,It's HORRIBLE!!!! Crappy adaptation of the 1959 version!! :S,"It's a horrible adaptation of the 1959 version with Maricruz Olivier, which was far better than this one. They made another version in 1989 with Salma Hayek which was also crappy, and now this. :(What can I say? They changed the ending to an inconsistent and dumb ending. Televisa makes nothing but remakes, and HORRIBLE remakes at best!! :S"
2,I had high expectations I guess,"I thought when I purchased teresa it was going to be the actual novela with the parts nobody cared about taken out. That was not the case. They literally took almost all of the novela out. If you've never seen this you won't get it what it is about from these short clips. Disliked, I'll stick to you tube or something.I did like the fact it was shipped in a timely manner. That was it though"
3,"Good, but not traditional, green tea","I like this particular green tea due to its smooth, fruity taste and aroma. I enjoy a cup (with a small amount of honey added) after dinner, or whenever I want to relax with a good book.As other reviewers have noted, however, this is not traditional green tea. It is a green tea blend that is lightly sweetened and has citrus undertones. While I personally enjoy these flavors, others might find it a bit too nontraditional."
2,packaging confuses,"I thought I was ordering authentic green tea, so when I got the green tea and it tasted like lemon and other sweet things and anything but green tea, I was very disappointed. Even from the name ""antioxidant"" green tea, I wouldn't normally expect such a fruit-flavored beverage. Frustrating. Having said that, I do enjoy Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea as one of the most drinkable low-priced greens, and I also appreciate their eco-friendly packaging. (And, really, it was my mistake in ordering the wrong tea, however I think their packaging or description maybe could be clearer about the differences.)"
4,Great tea! Not so great packaging though,"I love the taste of this tea. It's very smooth and not bitter as another reviewer stated. Very mellow and soothing.My only gripe is the packaging. With all other tea I've purchased in 20 count boxes, the bags came individually wrapped in metallic packages. These bags are loose in the box without any wrappers. They're all hooked together like sausage links, and as stated in the description they have no strings. So you have to fish them out of your tea cup with a spoon.If they were individually wrapped and had strings, they'd be 5 star IMO. And if you use Amazon's ""suscribe and save"", not only will this be cheaper, but shipping will always be free. And you can cancel at any time. I love this feature!"
2,This is for the tea with the elephant on the box,"I prefer the green tea with the dragon on the box, not the elephant. The tea with the dragon tastes more like traditional green tea than the elephant one. The green tea with the elephant had some extra ingredients that put the flavor off to me...I believe it was lemon or orange in the ingredients. It made the tea have a mildly citrus feel, but not in a refreshing way I would have liked. It has been over a year and I have not finished the box. If you are wanting a more traditional flavored green tea, get the green tea with the dragon on it. The flavor is much better with a stronger roasted taste."
2,Not simply Green Tea,"This tea is a blend, not simply just Green Tea leaves. Though the ingredient list states this, the name and label do not. Is Celestial Seasonings cutting costs this way? It's safe to wonder. It would be nice if the name was altered to reflect its true nature: a potpourri."
1,I'd sure like to read it sometime.,I ordered and paid for the book (Midnight Man by Steven Laws) and was sent the wrong book.The seller then said that they would refund the money but did not have the book to send.Sure be nice to get what I ordered.JY
3,Cute,"I got these for my soccer team cupcakes. They were really cute but when I baked the cupcakes in them the design all but disappears, I think they need more wax so the cake mix doesn't soak through. Anyway they did the trick but I would probably save my money next time."
5,The most adorable waffles in the world!,"This is a great product. It heats up very fast and makes 4 smaller sized waffles which are great for children and very practical for smaller appetites or those who need to serve more than one child breakfast at the same time. My only advise is to apply oil to the top half of the waffle maker and only put enough batter in each mold to fill the bottom half, otherwise they stick to the top part of the press and you have to pry them out. Stick to the ""less is more"" philosophy when pouring in the batter!"
3,HELL OH NO KITTY!,NOT WORTH ALL THE BOTHER FOR THE SMALLEST BITS OF FOOD TO EAT!ONLY GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH 1 KID THAT DOES NOT EAT HARDLY A THING!DONT BOTHER TO USE THIS IF U HAVE ANYONE HUNGRY WAITING TO EAT!PLUS THESE TINY TINY WAFFLES DO STICK NO MATTER HOW MUCH COOKING SPRAYYOU DO USE! THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST IF IT JUST WOULD HAVEMADE THE WHOLE WAFFLE THE ENTIRE SHAPE & SIZE OF HELLO KITTY'S HEAD IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CUT TO THE CHASE.......
5,Adorable Kitty Waffle Maker!,"I like this waffle maker a lot because its so cute!The drawback is that the waffle sizes turn out really small; and to feed four people, I have to go through the waffle making process on the appliance twice. It's annoying in the morning when I'm in a rush, but some people would say that it is worth having an adorable image on the waffle.I don't recommend this product if you are looking for a waffle maker that's going to make a lot of ""average"" sized waffles quickly for your family. This is simply a cute appliance meant to make a bunch of small waffles for your amusement.You can avoid shipping fees for this product if you buy it in Target. Target carries this product during the holiday season only!"
3,Urban Freud,"It seemed to me that this author found a way to link all of the mentioned urban legends to sex in some way. I found his statements for his reasoning to be confusing at best and downright silly at most times. As a continuing scholar of urban myths and legends, I think this book serves only to insult the intelligence of the average reader who does not know much about urban legends. The only reason the boook got three stars is the urban legends speak for themselves as classic tales everyone knows happened to someone they knew."
1,Look to actual folklorists for better books on Urban Legends,"This book may well be interesting, but it is not written by a folklorist and offers up some incorrect information. Folklorists would not call an urban legend a contemporary myth as the author claims; myths and legends are extremely different types of folk narrative. Any author who makes a mistake like that (even first year folklore students learn this stuff!) shouldn't be teaching others about the topic. The fact that this books begins by giving out misinformation from the first few pages (and it never quite manages to define folklore at all!) makes it a poor choice for those interested in Urban Legends. Search for a book by Jan Brunvand and find out what folklorists, who devote their lives to the scholarly study of legends like these, have to say on the matter."
4,Uncertain,"the Celebration CD is ok.The main problem with it is that there are almost no original songs on it.They are all remixes.As far as these remixes are concerned; Everybody,Somebody dance with me are good.Let The dream Come True on the other hand was destroyed.Also get the double CD.This one you're looking at is only the single one.The double has other remixes on it and a megamix.Keep on Dacing is a pretty good remix.it's only on the double CD.Buy these CD's only if you're a collector ar die hard fan such as myself."
3,It was real long.,"Seems like a decent shirt as far as quality, but it's too long for me. If you like tucking in your shirts or you just like long shirts then it may be fine for you."
4,A great approach to Italian,"I have looked at close to a hundred different language methods, and find that ""language immersion"", which is sometimes referred to as the Berlitz method, does not work for me. I need to know the nuts and bolts, and work my way up. Just parroting useful phrases leaves me COLD. ""Italian by Association"" delivers exactly what I wanted.What this book does, is in each chapter, it gives you a small vocabulary, some grammar rules, a pronunciation key to the vocabulary, and some chapter review quizs. Each chapter builds on the previous, and before you know it, you know any number of grammar rules, as well as vocabulary. In this way you build your skills from the ground up, rather than trying to hit the ground running.It is the closest thing I have found to a high school language textbook (circa 1970) anywhere, only a lot more interesting and fun.If you want to learn some basic Italian, and not just parrot some well worn phrases, this book is for you."
3,Tongue Scraper is GREAT!! - Company is NOT!!!,"I wanted these for stocking stuffers for family. I first placed an order for 5 through the company's website, but when completed, instead of getting an order confirmation I got an error message that said ""we're sorry - we're having technical difficulties. Please try again later"". So, of course I thought the order did not go through. I then checked to see if Amazon carried it, and sure enough they did, so I placed my order here. Don't you know I ended up receiving 2 orders, one through the company and one through Amazon. The company refused to accept responsibility for their faulty website, even after I emailed screen prints of the error message I received.TERRIBLE customer service, TERRIBLE company website. I'll never order from them again.The product is greaat. I've got enough to last me a lifetime."
3,"good content, poor quality","i am happy with the content of the book but i have only had it two days, read first two chapters and skimmed thru the rest..already the pages are falling out..i am very disappointed in the quality and dont know why it was made hardbound in the first place..i ordered it thru shapeboutique and i would have to pay s&h twice to return it so i am just keeping it...otherwise i look forward to putting the content to use"
2,Great price but you get what you pay for...,"It looks really great, easy to assemble and you can't beat the price, but it was very short-lived. It blows over very easily and the spokes broke repeatedly (I glued them with wood glue). The black faded to a nauseating dark green. I found the pin system to work poorly, I could never get it to stay up completely so the umbrella always sagged a bit. There are no instructions, which would have been helpful. Also, it is quite top heavy so I had a bear of a time keeping it completely upright (it kept listing to one side). If you don't mind using it for one season and not expecting it to last beyond that, it's well worth the price. I kept it open all the time because it was so difficult to open it securely, so it probably would have performed better if it was closed when not in use. Finally, it's really too tall for a regular patio table, so it would work better with a bistro-type patio table."
3,A Good Ending To A Good Series,"Okay, this is a good ending to a good series. Why did I only give it 3 stars well:Pros: great info into the characters pasts, good animation for the day(1992-1995), good back story, a good ending to a good series, more grey than simply good and evil.Cons: Horrible chiches and annoying concepts (i.e. flying, energy blasts, speed lines, etc.), some lazy/spotty animation, tournament concept feels very overplayed after dark tounement, series kind of hard to get into at this point.Though, regularly I'd give it 4 or 5 stars, the cons defatly outwheigh the pros and to be honest I really wouldn't recomend it to anyone who doesn't already like the series."
4,Outstanding music out of most standing rules,"This music is made of the material of which human beings should be made of. Fortunately there is still place on earth to find a true breakingthrough musician making its most valuable effort when facing the task of building a piece of himself a piece of art. This music comes from the very tradicional verve of east european classical music but offers a truly new view of it. No folclore is found in it, no political stance, no revolutionary insight view of society or people. This music addresses the inner core of all human beings unable to takle with the questions of life. Those without answers. This music is timeless and motionless in its unique sense of eternity, which somehow comes to mime quite precisely the concept of an instant. However, great effort in this music that, with a similar approach to reality, comes very far of standard impresionism."
1,disappointing,"You would figure that a book published by Harvard must be very good, right? Wrong. This book shows its origins as a doctoral dissertation, it is basically a compilation of atrocity reports from a couple of German security units. There is no analysis, not really much argument at all. Simply repeating that the Nazis were ruthless, sometimes using that word six times on one page, is not an argument. Nor is it news. The one insight that I came away with is that shifting expectations of which side would win shaped the reactions of the Russian population. No use of Russian sources: a book on partisan warfare without the partisan point of view!"
3,Not Bad,I bought this item to use on 3/16 stainless steel rod. The dies are ok for this but not for anything much larger. Maybe 1/4 inch at max. If anything bigger then the metal will slip off the die. Also I do not think the handle and the unit held in a vise would give you that much leverage to bend anything bigger.I wanted to bend the rod more than once (for example making a spiral) around the die and it could not do it because the die was too thin to wrap the rod around the die more than one. All in all ok for angle bends of small diameter metals but nothing else. Make sure you know it's limitations before buying.
1,a total joke,"Wow. My boyfriend and I rented this video the other night as a joke--it was HILARIOUS!! Absolutley useless as a fitness video, but worth seeing nonetheless.Bottom line: Funny, but not worth $13.99"
4,Great Beginner's Book!,"I'm a new student of Jyotish and this book has really helped me understand the unique qualities, strengths/weaknesses and planetary relationships of the different ascendants. We bought Svoboda's 'Light on Life' first which is thorough but overwelming. Next we got Bloomfied's Intro to Vedic Astrology which is great for showing the dynamic nature of charts and for getting comfortable with where everything is in any specific chart; however, because each ascendant introduces different relationships between the planets/houses the results predicted by Bloomfield's simplified analysis do not always pan out. The Ascendant fills the gap between these two books perfectly. My only criticism of the book is that it lacks illustrations or sample charts(I don't think there's a chart in the entire book!) that could show the differences that make each ascendant unique."
4,"""Jaws"" is more like it!","Phil, Pete, Micheal and Ansley rock out! This is a killeralbum. It took a few listens to it to really appreciate itas a UFO album but it really does rank up there with theother albums. No one can argue that these guys still blowaway most bands out there. It's too bad Micheal can't stickaround. If you like the Moog/Way albums you'll love this!"
4,Stll alive and well!,"If you like UFO---buy this CD! If you love rock and roll, buy this CD! If you think guys in their 40's and 50's can't rock---buy this CD!"
5,Surprisingly good,"Classic hard rock with matured Micheal Schenker style. For the UFO and MS fans, this will not disappoint. Any hard rock lover will enjoy."
4,Glad they're still doing it!,"Strong album from a very underrated band. Rock fans pretty much have to be satisfied with the ""every three years"" reunion cd nowdays. Some bands lose their touch if they haven't been together (either touring or making albums) for a while. UFO is one band that has not yet lost its touch. This one isn't as good as ""Walk on Water"", but is still satisfying. Ron Nevison and Paul Raymond are missed. Best songs are ""Outlaw Man"" and ""Sea of Faith"". ""Someone's Gonna Have to Pay"" sounds vaguely like the Scorpions ""The Zoo"" and looks like a great jam song in concerts. Hopefully the guys can keep from killing each other long enough to do a tour!!!!"
5,Sharks Shreds!,"I simply want to echo the sentiments of all the positive reviews already posted... this CD is great! I have been a longtime fan of UFO and cringe when people keep comparing everything to the their 70's work. It will never be that way again! But while the song writing has changed the musicianship is second-to-none. The tone of Schenker's guitar, Mogg's voice and Way's bass continue to impress and I love the way that the sounds are layered on this CD. The Top 3 tunes have to be Serenity, Perfect View & Sea of Faith as they come the closest to classic UFO. Even the tidbit that is Hawaii ends the CD on a cool vibe. Don't compare... enjoy! And if you just have to compare things then think about all the other music that is being made today... a new UFO CD in 2002 is just what the Doctor (Doctor) ordered! UFO Rules!!"
2,Good Feeding For Some Sharks!,"What the [heck] happened to UFO?? Phil Mogg's voice is totally shot...Michael Schenker's guitarwork is sounding more like Neil Young (sloppy and relatively slow for Schenker)....The songs make Weezer look like a Prog Rock band....With the exception of ""Serenity"" and ""Sea of Faith"" this one should be thrown to the sharks. They may, however, spit it back out! Save your hard earned money and invest in classic UFO- ""Phenomenon"", ""Force It"" etc...."
2,A BIG DISAPOINTMENT,"This album has many good riffs but no great songs. Maybe two good songs (not great, just good). I thought ``Covenant`` was weaker than ``Walk on water`` but 'Sharks' is weaker than 'Covenant'(to give you an idea). it's an album that you can play when you do something else but if you concentrate there is nothing that will blow your mind. I should mention that I'm a UFO maniac since 1981 so I know their music."
2,Abducted stars,"Only two stars...well yes because there are only two stars on this album:Michael Schenker and the magnificient Aynsley Dunbar!Unfortunately they don't show much of their talent here.The songs are flat, Mogg's voice sounds like an unhealthy complaint and the production doesn't give the kick this album needs.Schenker and Dunbar have been abducted by ufo...please release them!Try MSG's Beware the scorpions or some early UFO stuff instead."
2,ROCK BOTTOM,"I HAVE TO AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER, MR DAVE PARKER, THIS IS PRETTY BAD. I ALSO DONT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY OF THESE OTHER REVIEWS COULD BE THAT GOOD.IT IS JUST NOT THAT GOOD. I HAVE BEEN A UFO FAN FOR ABOUT 20YRS AND THIS WOULD HAVE TO RANK AT THE BOTTOM.THE SONG WRITTING IS NOT VERY STRONG. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE OF MOOG'S VOCALS ARE ALWAYS STRONG AND SOLID AND SCHENKERS SOLO'S. THIS IS WORSE THAN ""COVENANT"" WHICH HAS 4-5 SOLID SONGS ON IT, WITH SHARKS I CAN MAYBE THINK OF 2 AT THE MOST.THINGS LOOKED HOPEFUL WHEN WALK ON WATER CAME OUT, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE NOW. SCHENKER'S SOLO STUFF HAS BEEN PRETTY SAD FOR THE MOST PART ALSO. HAS THE UFO/MSG SHIP LANDED FOR GOOD....? I HOPE NOT. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL FLY AGAIN IN A QUALITY SHIP."
2,Should Be Called Tortoise....,"A few random thoughts on the new UFO album ""Sharks"".Phil Mogg sounds very very tired. Very few songs welcome repeated listinings. Michael Schenker's involvement seems minimal at best (a few token solos here and there to justify using the UFO name). There are no ""Doctor Doctor"", ""Lights Out"" or ""Natural Thing"" like riffs to be found. The album does not pick up any steam until track five.You know Schenker has it in him because ""Beware Of Scorpions"" kicks...; not here. This is really a Mogg-Way album with Michael Schenker taking a few guest solos. Michael is UFO and there is no such thing as UFO without him.I could go on, but there is really nothing here to justify buying this disc. Wait a few month and pick it up in the cut-out bin like ""Covenant"" or ""Walk On Water""."
4,Still some magic left!,"Sharks is a good album and any UFO fan would be pleased with more than a few songs here. Certainly not as good as Walk on Water, but definitely better than Covenant. It's tempting to point out what's wrong with the album (no Ron Nevison polish; lack of Obsession-memorable Schenker solos; a few songs that seem just a bit unfinished), the good easily outweighs the negative. Serenity and Crossing Over have the old UFO magic and hint that the old guys might even have another album or two left in them."
5,"Better Than The Crap They Call ""New Music""","This albums rocks! It simply rocks. If you are lookingfor something to bang your head, buy this album.Alot of the newer groups out there really suck.I've been waiting for another ""Nirvana"" to comeout and shake things up. Until that happens albumslike this will do nicely. Great lyrics, great singing,great rhythm, EXCELLENT guitar work by Michael Schenker.And NO lyrics about ""bling bling"", being a player pimp,or degrading women. Just straight-ahead rock and roll.Eddie Van Halen needs to listen to albums like thiswhen preparing for the new album (whenever that will be)."
3,Sharks doesn't have the teeth ...,"Sharks was the third of the Schenker ""reunion"" albums and it just isn't as strong of an album as Walk On Water or Covenant. If you are a fan of the band you will like it because it does have its moments, they are just too few to rate much more than average. Who knows why, but maybe Schenker had gotten bored by the time they did this one. The songs themselves are standard UFO, the problem is there are only a couple that truly jump out at you.Song Highlights include: Outlaw Man, Deadman Walking, Shadow Dancer and Sea Of Faith.If you are a fan of UFO, Sharks does deserve a place in your collection, just not at the top. Newer fans will want to start with many other albums from the group's huge catalog."
3,It's not lights out but has it's moments,"This is an overall good cd. It's not the music they did in the 70's but I still think it has some very worthwhile cuts on it. The first three tracks make up the heart of the cd. It is better produced than covenant. Schenker is now out of the band and this is probaly the last cd with him on it outside what he might do in the future with his own group. It isn't as great as some poeple make it out to be or just going through the motions because there are five tracks that I really like. It's not Lights Out or Force but it is better than high stakes, misdemeandor, covenant, and ain't misbehaving. It's good to have some new material."
4,Schenker proves it again!!,"Michael Schenker prove again that he's the best hard riock guitarrist that ever lived on Earth. The guy is pure genius!!Listen, I LOVE UFO, I know their history, etc, etc, but I'm not blind (or deaf, I mean!) I can say without bias: this is a very, very fine album. There is no filler or throaway song, it is really better than COVENANT.The production by Mike Varney and Fontano left a little to be desired, but this was a minor flaw. The songs, and that's what matters in the end, are very good, and are a proud part of UFO's catalogue now (much better tha THE WILD THE WILLING AND THE INNOCENT, or better than anything UFO ever recorded without Schenker!)"
1,Irrelevant product,"I'm just not convinced that you need to spend $699 or more on a device like this. Maybe back in 2006 when they were introduced while the memory wasn't cheap and the smaller screen size on many of the cameras. 3.7"" is not that much bigger than what you'd find on a small point and shoot today. Also, you can buy an ipad for $499 that includes so many more capabilities and plenty of memory if you'd like to review your pics while on the road. For example, I can take over 1,000 pictures in the largest jpeg format with my Canon 7D on a 16GB CF card which costs less than $90 now. If you have money to through away - buy this product.My recommendation:Apple iPad $499.Western Digital 500GB External HD $60 (6.25 times the size)"
4,A nice buy for both beginners and advanced student of botany,"The book is mostly composed of dichotomous keys with a good section of very nice photographs of most commonly encountered plants, covering many genera. It is a sizable book for the field and covers the SF Bay Area really well. The only thing I have to complain is that is doesn't have species descriptions and more pictures, but these are probably out of the scope of this book. It is a great buy and I do highly recommend it."
2,needs to be more organized for non scientific person,So far i am trying to figure out how to find the cross references to the pictures and plant discriptions. the flowers should be organized according to color.
5,The best khakis made,"Yes they are more expensive than Dockers, but worth every penny. I have several pairs that are going on 4 years old that are commercally laundered and starched every other week. You will be lucky to have a pair of Dockers last six months.Great fit, great materal and high quality. The best khakis on the market."
2,"Not as good as they should be. Authentic, my Aunt Fanny.","The trousers I wore, when the US Army still wore khakis, were of a much higher quality than these (but so were civilian clothes). More care was taken in the assembly of my khaki uniforms than I can find in anything available these days, and the fit was better. And that includes Bills Khakis, which cost twice as much as they should, at a hundred dollars a pop. I did buy a used pair, and they have met my needs after a visit to a tailor. But brand new, without cuffs or hemming? Not at the price they're asking. On the other hand, they're probably better than the other crap that's being offered by other retailers. If nothing else, they have better fabric--IF AND ONLY IF you stick to the original khaki fabric, The other fabrics they offer are crap, just like the others offer."
3,Not what they're cracked up to be.,"These are good khakis. But they are not at all like authentic WW2 khakis. Real WW2 khakis had double stitched (French seams) on both sides of the legs as well as on the front pockets. They had quarter pockets, not online pockets. They had buttons, not zippers and the fit on real WW2 khakis were much high waisted, baggier and had much bigger leg openings. All that said, I'm OK with the changes in pattern but what I'm not OK with is the fabric, cheap thread and sewing. You'd be hard pressed to find WW2 khakis that pucker on the seams and go thread bare as quickly as mine did."
5,Unbelieveable pant!,"They are a bit pricey, but wear so well. Friends have worn them for years, durable like Jeans, but look much more classy. They come unfinished at the bottom so you'll have to get them hemmed, for non-standard guys, this works best. Enjoy them!"
2,Broken,I was very excited when my shipment arrived. Imagine my consternation when I unpacked it to find one of the plates was broken. So sad.
2,"Sorry, it doesn't really take off","Even though Pretty Maids are a solid heavy metal band, one can't deny that this album is a lot weaker than we are used to. If you're curios about this normally excellent band, do not begin with this one. The only great song here is the opening ""Running out"". I can't say that the rest of the material is crap but it sure hasn't the same attractiveness or the appeal of albums like ""Red, hot and heavy"", Carpe diem"" or ""Planet panic""."
2,Title is very deceptive,"C++ the art of programming. Sounds like you can become a master programmer buy learning from this book. Hardly. This book is just a step above C++ for dummies. There is no coverage of OOP in this book. Just a brief snippet about what an object is. This book might appeal for someone who has never programmed before, but if you want to learn C++ from an object-oriented perspective then look somewhere else. This author snagged a great title for an otherwise weak book. Don't buy this book unless you have never programmed a day in your life."
3,Opinion,"Great if you need to quit the hard stuff not so much if you want insight into why you do what you do, and how to better substitute your actions in a common addiction. Good info just geared more toward hard addictions."
5,Great Mystery Books!,"I read these books to my 10 year old son and he absolutely loves them. The characters are great and all the books have the right blend of spooky happenings, suspense, action and danger. Lots of creeping around at night. This one has a ghost, a stolen statue, and staking out the suspects at an apartment complex with surveliance cameras. We read these mysteries in the dark outside on the porch and my son is always begging for more. The chapters always end at just the right moment, leaving you hanging, so you'll have to come back for more!I love how the series is set in the Los Angeles area in its Hitchock heydey. All the place and street names add a nostalgic mood. Plus as you read the series, you get to know and love the characters of the three investigators, Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews along with all the characters at the Jones Salvage yard."
4,Great way to learn about Mary Q. O. S.,"Even though this book is chaneled to a younger audience it is still very entertaining and educational for older children. The comics were great, and I really enjoyed reading this book."
5,life changing book,"After reading Superlearning, and discovering how creative people like Teri Mahaney had made use of it, I also discovered another treasure - Teri, and her wonderful technology!Even though I have read her book until it is dog-eared, and made dozens upon dozens of subliminal tapes, I plan to buy her latest version just to see what new and amazing things she has to say.She's a creative genius and great friend. Thanks, Teri!"
5,Fillet Knife,"I bought this knift as a gift for my boyfriend who is a die hard fisherman. Since it hasn't been used yet, I can't really give it a review. But if your looking for a quality knife for someone special and you would like to get it ingraved, this is the perfect knife. I shopped around for a filleting knife to get ingraved and all the knives out there seemed cheap. I wanted a gift that would last forever and not rust. When the gift was opened, my boyfriend was shocked at the type of knife it was, he did know that brand and he knew it was a very good fillet knife. The engraving on it was awesome! I took it to Things Remembered and they did a spectacular job! At least if we break up, he can remember me everytime he uses the knife :)."
5,wow! inspiring,a WOW book not only for the piecing of New York Beauty quilts but for the free motion quilting as well. Excellent instructions for piecing; good guidance for color and fabric selection. Inspiring ideas for large as well as small quilts. I'm ready to pull out fabric and start designing my own quilt!
5,Good book source,"Wow how simple to get my quilting book, arrived and was in great condition, great price with reasonable shipping- would absolutely order with them again! Thanks"
3,"Nice pair of earrings, but...","I do wear these earrings. They are fairly good sized and lightweight. I didn't care for the concave given to the back section. I would have much preferred they were a little heavier and flat - especially for the price. Although I'm not sorry I purchased them, I'm sure I would have purchased something else if I had seen them in person at a store, jewelry case, etc."
5,Great Flick!,"Just went looking for a dvd of this ""forgotten"" classic, and found that there just isn't one. Shame- this is a terrific thriller! Just a vote here for a dvd!"
3,It's just OK,It's just an OK movie that doesn't stand the test of time. The script is weak. Charlton Heston directs and could have been better.
1,Don't get,This product was in the format of England VHS's. So I could only hear the voices but could not see the movie.
3,nice nature,The girl who can't do anything but scream and cry is done nicely in this film. The accent makes it difficult to understand most of Charlton Heston's dialog. Can't even read the lips because it is either pitch black or the beard obscures his mouth. The scenery was beautiful. Too bad compounded stupidity makes this a hard to watch til the end film.
4,A solid thriller that will hopefully be re-released soon,I don't think the critics cared much for this film but I remember seeing it when I was younger and thought it was pretty intense. Charlton Heston does a great job with his role. Kim Basinger also does a good job in an early role for her. The story line is tense and leaves the viewer guessing up until the end. I was also very impressed with the locations and the sets used in the film. The scenery of the British Columbia location is impressive and the scenes in the mine set a great tone. All in all I really enjoyed this film and hope to see it re-released in the future.
5,Great thriller,"I have seen this movie three times since it came out. Its a great movie. I don't know how it was received in the box office when it first came out, but it should have done well. It needs to be released in DVD format. Please! someone take notice and do something about it. Thanks"
4,Nice Christian CD,This is a great CD I saw Bruce in concert back when he was singing at church's and I have spent a long time looking for this CD. I recommend this to anyone who loves easy listening christian music.
2,Tape didnt play good.,"I dont know whats going on, I purchased the two tapes, couldnt wait to hear them, I even cleaned my deck player. And it dragged all the way thru it too! A big bummer!"
4,Living In The Material World,"This is a good set to have if nothing more than to follow George's transition from the Beatle's breakup to Brainwashed. This CD makes me feel like I am listening to a late night FM Station and or just need some background music with the exception of the 2 bonus tracks which are outstanding. The DVD is good reference and is a nice addition to complete this set, but not essential."
3,What about the original album's integrity???,"One thing that really annoys me about reissues is the tacking-on of extra tracks which weren't in the artist's original conception of the album. With the ""John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band"" MFSL gold CD, for instance, the ""Power to the People"" single was added, which completely detracted from the album, being in a different style and coming after the finale of the original.With this one, these tracks (and the studio version of ""Bangla Desh"" should have been included too) could have been added to the bonus disc just as easily, giving it more length while preserving the integrity of the original...Oh well. It's not a bad album in itself, but tends to be a bit bland in comparison to most of his other work. Great packaging to the LP, but the songs just lack the power of ""All Things must pass"". To me, it even ranks lower than ""Extra Texture"" among his 1970s work."
3,"there are some pleasant songs, surely","i revisted this record recently--i had it on eight track at prep school and wore it out, as i recall. it doesn't really hold up, sadly enough. sorta like ""all things must pass"" (the only george record you REALLY need to own) mach 2, three years on. the arrangements are kinda desultory, the melodies maudlin. the sweet lord is really f-ed up on Krishna. ""don't let me wait too long"" is a great poppy piece, but--however unfair it is to hold a writer to his own very hightest standards--it's no ""here comes the sun."" i wanted to love this again. couldn't. but i like it as there are some pleasant songs surely. find it on vinyl--used. egads i almost bought ""dark horse"" (for the cover and the title track). good thing i stayed my hand."
2,Living in the Material World,"I was disappointed with this purchase. I believed that there was a DVD with a 5.1 surround mix included in the package but this was not true. In the future, please inform the consumer as to exactly what is included in the CD/DVD package."
4,"Amazon's ""bonus"" DVD is CENSORED!","This album is pleasant enough, and much better due to remastering. However, beware that not only is the ""bonus"" DVD woefully short at 15 minutes, but the version Amazon has been selling is CENSORED. Here's where: During the album's photo shoot chronicled in the ""Miss O'Dell"" montage, there are three stills of a NUDE LADY sitting in a window. On the version I bought through Amazon, all three shots have a BLACK BAR over the nipples. This was not a problem except that I have seen others' bonus DVD's, and the bars are simply NOT there. So, if you're going to spend the extra money on this title JUST for 15 minutes worth of footage and/or montages, DON'T buy it from here. It's silly for me to make a fuss over three seconds of nipple, but even siller for us not to be told by EMI *or* Amazon what we're paying for in comparison to someone else. I'm an ADULT, and I want my DVD's UN-CUT!"
4,DVD bonus rather slight,"I must agree with the previous reviewer. As big a George fan as I am, it is hard to justify paying TWICE the price (regular version $15.99, deluxe version $29.99) While the packaging and booklet are nice, the dvd clocks in at about twelve minutes, and the only rewatchable part is the live in Japan ""Give me love"" The alternate versions of Miss Odell and Sue me sue you blues have already been widely bootlegged years ago, and will be no surprise to any hardcore fans. Having said that, I do feel they did a very good job on the remastering. Sound quality is much improved over the previous issue."
5,george harrison,i like most of george harrison music and i have got such on vinal lps but i wanted to down load them onto my mp3 mp4 so that why i brought them
4,Not The Documentary,I bought this believing it was the Scorsese directed documentary. Instead recieved the rereleased version of the 1972 album of the same name
3,Expected more on DVD,I bought this second Living in the Material World CD because it included a DVD. I was hoping it had more footage from the Concert in Japan or simply more music performed by George Harrison in a visual format. I was very disappointed indeed. I wish the Harrison family would put out the entire Concert in Japan for us diehard Harrison fans.
5,George Harrison's best,I love George Harrison and I am replenishing my cd collection. This cd is by far some of his greatest work.
5,Divided to the Vein - Scott Minerbrook,"A brave and gutsy chronicle of an inter-racial family. Minerbrook draws vivid pictures of human beings struggling with cultural differences, gender issues, and parental failings as well as unyielding prejudice by both races. He never condemns, only describes grippingly. He not only survived; he achieved wholeness and stability despite stunning obstacles. I'll never look at a bi-racial person the same way again."
3,Almost There,"This book offers an excellent and large selection of destinations and provides ample information about them. I would wish for a greater number of unusual entries, however, those uncovered with more depth of searching. As destination ideas, these entries are not difficult to obtain on one's own."
4,Excellent,"I've been using this Cologne for about 18-20 years. I happen to like it on me and so do my female friends (so said) I think that is true. As colognes go this is an excellent brand and the quality and smell has seemed to stay the same, this is important if you like the same thing and want to use it over a long time frame. All Fragrance are expensive to me so I try to get one that works well and a small amount last a long time plus holds it fragrance (smell) also."
5,Fanstastic Civil War Book,"This book on the Battle of the Wilderness, is one of the top two Civil War books I have ever read (Cozzen's Book on Chickamauga ""This Terrible Sound"" being the other). The maps are detailed but crystal clear, and allow you to totally follow the troop movements described in the book. Steere's writing similarly is detailed but exciting and clear. I've read this book over the years at least five times, and it's time to read it again! More detailed than Rhea's book on the same subject, by the way. Rhea's book is good too, but this one is much better for the hard-core Civil War reader."
4,Great Birthday Cake Idea,"When I ordered this pan, I thought that it was just a flat cake mold where the cake would by lying on its side. When the pan came, I found that it was a 3D cake pan. I was a little disappointed because for nostalgic reasons I had wanted a flat one. Fortunately using only one side of the pan I could easily make the cake I wanted. I followed the instructions and still had a little trouble with the cake sticking to the pan, but I am sure that is something I could fix next time. The cake turned out wonderful and I am really glad I ordered it."
3,queten tarentino-another excellent director,"3 people get abducted by an escaped con and his brother and go to mexico.they hang out in a bar full of vampires all night.george clooney is in it.he does an outstanding job as a escaped prisoner.then theres some freaky sex offender type-not necessary!and the 3 hostages.they are some old preacher dude,juliette lewis and some mexican kid.this is not for children.it is by far and away the best of the from dusk till dawn set.there is a post rape scene at the front that could turn a few heads.thier is a mexican stripper who.........well.....strips and of course the always awesome julieete lewis to look at.every role ive ever seen her play she did an excellent job.she is my favorite actress.the hype says this movie rocks and it does.there is a special apperance by cheech also.filthy and brief.juliette lewis and george clooney both do an excellent job but have better films out there."
4,Carzy JUNK,"Quentin Tarantino, i mean what can you expect from him beacuse he is the greatest writer/director ever. He always packs the action that you want into his movies. Now tell me did Pulp Fiction dissapoint you, well if i did you it didn't here. I love alll his films. I only need to see ""Natural Born Killers"" to complete the series..."
2,2 Short movies,"This is not really a movie. It's just two stories put together with no link at all. It has very little to remember, other than Salma Hayek dancing in that wonderful bikini. Without her, I would have rated it with only one star.It's not a good comedy, nor a terror story, the characters have no appeal, everything is too predictable, the script is crap, the acting is not good either, etc, etc.If it not were for Salma...."
5,A near perfect film from Robert Rodriguez!,"This film is relentless and very exciting. Some of the CGI effects don't quite cut it, for me, and some of the vampire make-up and acting is a little fake looking, but that aside, there are no other flaws in the film.Great music, gore, acting, and crash and burn style writing!"
4,Great Dvd Except for.......,"Great Movie. One of the Best ""B"" movies of the 90sGreat Dvd with many extras. The only bad thing about the dvd transfer is that it's not enhanced for widescreen Tvs, so if you own one, it will not play in widescreen mode.JPD"
5,A wonderful guilty pleasure,"Sometimes there are things in life we really like, but we don't admit to it. Maybe it's disco or pro wrestling or prunes. Whatever it is, you love it in secret...for fear of what others might think.For me, this film is one of my guilty pleasures. Sure, there are a million campy things in the movie that we could point out if we wanted to, but why go to all that trouble? This is a silly, campy, fun, frightening, exciting, and sexy film. I watch it a few times a year, especially if my friends drop by.Whenever people tease me about liking this film, I always stand my ground. If it's a woman who does the teasing, I say something like, ""Hey, it's all just for fun."" If it's a man who teases me, I take a look to the left...a look to the right...lean in and say, ""Hey, Salma Hayek does a dance sequence in this film that will change your life.""James Green, author of ""If There's One Thing I've Learned,"""
5,Great,This is a great vampire movie if you watch it and think the begging is kind of slow just wait till it picks up. It is a great movie.
3,Hollywood&#65533;s Great B-Movie,"Some of the reviews here are written a little too seriously. While this is by far a good film, it nevertheless achieves its original intention. Quentin Tarantino owed a script to these special effects guys, therefore this movie was the result. With his good buddy Robert Rodriguez as director, famous for his kinetic and often ludicrous action sequences, this movie is an over the top romp. You can't take this movie too seriously because its just not that kind of movie. It's fun eye candy. Selma Hayek in a bikini doing a snake dance? If that isn't gratuitous, I don't know what is. And then there's the extra gory violence. If this movie was made by a special effects company, then you have should expected no less. I had a really good time watching this movie, especially the scene that invovles a ... monologue (Very, very funny). So grab your favorite date, turn off the lights and enjoy these two hours of fun."
5,Great bonus disc included.,I am a Tarantino fan and bought this to complete my collection of his films. It has a great bonus disc that has insight of the making of the film.
3,Love the Movie,"This is a great vampire movie, my favorite. The product quality was okay but could have been better."
4,Cult classic?,The best little house of vampires you ever watched. At least the weirdest of quentin tarantino's weid movies.
2,...,"this movie started out like it was going to be a really good tarantino movie, then up and turns into something else. i'm also not a fan of the fact that cheech plays like three different characters. it's just confusing. probably wouldn't highly recommend the movie..."
1,Could you last from dusk to dawn?,"I don't know how I managed to see this gory splatterfest TWICE in college.It's a terrible movie (next to that other awful movie ""Wild Wild West"" which also stars Salma Hayek)Quentin Tarantino&George; Clooney play a pair of ne'er do wells who take a family hostage.They end up going to a strip joint filled with evil vampires...and battling them until dawn.Turns out that the strip joint is built on top of an Aztec temple,hence the bloodsucking strippers.George Clooney managed to overcome this,as well as ""Batman&Robin;"" to get into ""Syriana""&""Good Night,and Good Luck."" He's a talented actor;too bad he couldn't save this movie through sheer charm.When it comes to heists,he's better in ""Ocean'e Eleven"" as a dapper casino-robbing metrosexual.Avoid this movie,unless you REALLY like gruesome,violent movies..."
3,A Bloodsucking Thrill Ride To The End,"Viloent,bloody and often times very funny. Two wild Bank Robbers on the run from a massive killing spree head to Mexico to hook up with a man who will give them protection from the law. But things don`t go as planed, They make an arrangment to meet at a local bar filled with exotic dancers but the man who supposed to give them protection never shows and soon enough an altercation with one of the locals brings out a horde of flesh eating vampires for a night these two robbers will never forget. Far fetched story but it kept me going on through the end. I really did enjoy the outlandish performances of Clooney and Tarantino as the two bank robbing brothers on the run. Harvey keital plays his part as the unwillingy hostage they capture very convincley. If you like mindless fun with Bloody violence and sharp foul mouthed humor you will love FROM DUSK TILL DAWN."
5,Flawless display of over the top blood and gore!,"What can you say about a movie that has vampires, guns and some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear in any movie. Directed with typical flair by one of the most innovatative and original people in Hollywood. The opening's perfect, the middle's perfect and the end is perfect. Acting is great on all fronts, and George Clooney should be proud. If you haven't seen this yet, their is something wrong with you, and if you think it's below par, then get a life and open your mind to something that's just a little bit different!"
4,Natural Born Killers Meet the Vampires,"The 90's version of the old Abbott & Costello flicks, where the ""heroes"" meet Dracula, Frankenstein et al. This film parodies not only the horror genre, but the the more recent crime movies featuring sociopath hipsters, a la Tarantino and Stone. Not surprising that this one was written by Tarantino, supposedly his first screenplay. Cast (Clooney, Keitel, Lewis, Tarantino, Hayek, Cheech . . .), directing (Rodriguez) screenplay and action are all great, and the film laughs at itself throughout. If you don't laugh too, you're probably missing the point. END"
3,Interesting ...,"Apparently this was the movie Quentin really wanted to make. ""From Dusk to Dawn"" starts off with the traditional Quention recipe and I admit I found it disturbing in scenes. I had been told many years ago that there was a vampire theme in this, so wasn't sure if I had the right movie because there is no hint of that in the first half of the film. Suddenly it just changes and goes totally bizarre .... but as I said, this was a theme that Quention really wanted to pursue.All I can say is, don't take the film seriously. Just sit back and enjoy. It will become a cult classic ... slowly but surely. George Clooney is brilliant in this.DVD EVALUATION: Early DVD version had poor transfer and limited extras. Best to locate new Collectors version with sharp clear transfer and plenty of extras. Worth adding to your collection particularly if you enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction""."
4,worth watching,this movie is worth watching.for the entertainment value at least. i thought it was enjoyable and the special effects were great. if you want a movie that you don't have to think through and want to enjoy then this is one to watch
3,Very Interesting,"Worth watching once, but not twice . It held my interest at the beginning and then it completley changed into another movie, very different!"
2,Utter Junk,"This film is exploitative trash and not in the good sense of the word. There are three things that redeem this film from the trash heap of total worthlessness. Harvey Keitel, even in a trashy enterprise like this, delivers a decent performance as a preacher who is grappling with his faith. Even in junk like this Keitel didn't succumb to the urge to just phone it in. Cheech Marin has an amusing bit as the strip club's barker. Lastly, Salma Hayek's snake-dance. Thank God for chapter search, otherwise, you would have to sit through the rest of this dreck to get to the good parts. On a final note, Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the worst acting performances known to man. This is no reflection on the sicko character that he plays, it's just unadulterated bad acting. Tarantino is a great director but he is no actor."
2,"Nice Cinematography, Shame About The Script","The film looks good. That cannot be denied. It looks stylish and is directed with flair. Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolecent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy.One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts.I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump. It was like watching a cartoon.Disappointing."
4,"Great Transfer, much better than DVD!","This film had a great transfer, there is some grain but the film is 17 years old. I was saddened however that there were no extra features. Otherwise a great picture, great sound!"
2,Example of Poor Film,"The scene in here which ""got"" my attention was the one in the bar....where the vampires appear for the first time. Problem is I don't care what happens to the main characters...including Clooney who I really admire (e.g. Solaris). Clooney and company commit Mose's Sin, and have no redeeming qualities after that. Never saw Clooney act the smuck, dumb-ass before. Tarantino is another loser character who trys at acting. This is not the caliber of Pulp Fiction. By the way, the commentary extra disc on this is awful! Disjointed garbage.Last movie I saw this bad was Somewhere for different reasons."
1,tarantino lover,The movie itself is five stars. I love it. The one star is for the lousy non-anamorphic transfer. All other Tarantino movies have been transfered in anamorphic except this one. WHY??
1,I don't get it.,"This is described on the box as ""Hip and funny."" Tarantino's character rapes and murders a hostage. Clooney and Tarantino shoot up a clerk and eventually burn him alive. Someone explain this to me - which one is hip and which one is funny? And that's before this turkey turns into an ridiculous special effects gore fest vampire movie. I don't get it, and I don't want to."
1,One of the worst,"This show is terrible. I can't believe there are sequels. The last half of the show drags out on and on. I fast forwarded through it just to get it over with. Please don't waste your money. I tried to give this show no stars, but unfortunately the system requires at least 1."
1,Lame and Cheesy,"I bought this movie because all the reviews said it was exellent and before the vampires came in it was. George Cloony and Quinton terrintino were great but once this so called vampires came in it sucked. For instance one of the vampires faces became scaley and lizard like, and arent vampires supposed to be like bats? They did turn into bats later. If you sre looking for a really food vampire flick get Interview With The Vampire, Underworld, or The Lost Boys."
1,AWEFUL!,I was so discouraged when I saw how poorly this film was made. The special effects were sad and the acting was really bad! The sequel to this movie is even worse! Don't bother seeing it unless you want to have a good laugh!
5,Clooney is God.....I Loved Dusk!!!,"OK everyone, I knew very well going into this movie that there were vampires. The beginning doesn't have them, but who cares? THe story is great and they give you enough background to show why in the hell they ended up at the T**TY Twister. George Clooney was great as Seth Gecko....harsh and cruel but the single most likeable character in the film. Salma Hayek's memorable dance as the Vampire Queen is cool too. Quentin and Rodriguez did an incredible job making possible the greatest Vampire movie I have ever seen. Any horror/action/Quentin fan should be more than willing to add this to his or her collection!! Have a nice day :-)"
5,dusk til dawn,"I loved every bit of this movie. Every actor, the plot, everything. especially the foru main characters. I just love horror movies. June."
2,Avoid this....,"The only thing is this film worth watching is Clooney. He actually showed he could act here, and went on to make much better films. This is really just a vanity project for Tarantino, who proves that ego doesn't make you a great actor. This was made in 1996, when Tarantino (and Rodriguez, to a lesser extent) were movie ""rock stars"". They could do whatever they wanted. Quentin decided that he wanted to write and act in a film, and he shows he can't act for &%$%&. He is really bad here. His script is really boring, filled with cliches, and just used as an excuse to show carnage and gore at the end of the film. Lewis and Kietel just seem to be going through the motions here, and Rodriguez's direction is very uninspiring. Avoid, avoid."
3,"Good movie, but","If you can tolerate the crappy ""acting"" by Quentin Tarrintino, then you are a much more tolerant person than me."
4,George Clooney's best performance,"This is one of those really good movies that has an excellent plot twist right in the middle of it. What starts out as an action-thriller turns into a vampire gore fest. I think that the film for the most part was very well done. However, I found that the excessive amount of profanity in the film was really offensive and that's why I only give it 4 stars. Every time I see a movie with George Clooney, I always remember him as Seth Gecko because that's the role that I think suited him best. It's too bad that he didn't return in From Dusk Till Dawn 2."
3,Pretty Lame,"The beginning of From Dusk till Dawn is cool and the acting, story and everything are great. But from those vampires thingy... that was pretty lame. they should've made anothre plot."
5,A good ol' vampire flick!!!,I don't know why so many people put this movie down. It's a goodmovie. Sure it doesn't have the best acting but it's still good. It's blood soaked and good. I own it on DVD.
3,Perfect...........of type,"Quentin Tarretino apparently likes to involve himself in films with no plot to speak of, or in which the plot is irrelevant. FROM DUSK TO DAWN is a case in point. It reduces the post-Hammer Vampire film to it's most basic elements: the world is a scary place, full of monsters, where sex and death are messy twins. There are no philisophical points. There is no character development. There are no good guys. The movie is about as subtle as a hand grenade. Nevertheless, what it does it does perfectly. If you liked the Hammer horror films of the '70's ... a lot of blood, spookey makeup, and as much sex as the censors would let by (then), then you will like this film. This is a ""B"" grade horror film, at the top of it's class for style. If you don't LIKE ""B"" grade horror films, this isn't for you."
2,"Silly plot, poor acting, lots of violence.",It's not the worst vampire film I've ever seen but it't not that good either. Lots of pointless violence in a remarkably silly plot with acting that's so-so at best.
2,Went downhill fast!,"The opening scene was very tense and suspenseful. The brutality of the theives kept me on edge because of their willingness to kill. After their escape to a motel, the film went downhill very fast. Without giving away anythng, when you get shot, you at least TRY to tend to it, not wrap it in duct tape! After arriving in Mexico, the movie turns abruptly into a horror-comedy, which I absolutely hate. Be one or the other please! The action in the Mexican bar was very predictable and been-there-seen-it before. Very disappointing overall."
1,WOW 2.0,"WOW........................Miramax releases From Dusk till Dawn, Halloween H2O and The Yards for $9.99 at Best buy with 2.0 mono stereo sound!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice try on trying to dupe the customer over. I had all 3 in my hand and was ready to buy until I read 2.0 mono stereo sound. What a Joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,From Dusk till Dawn,"A great vampire horror film. One of the best of it's kind. Starring Harvey Keital, George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu, John Saxon, Fred Williamosn, Cheech Marin, Salma Heyek, Tom Savani, Kelly Preston, Marc Lawrence,Brenda Hillhouse, Michael Parks and Danny Trejo."
4,Classic Tarintino,"Watching this movie is like viewing two separate movies that are loosely related. The first half is classic Tarintino with excellent dialogue and bizarre situations. The second half is entirely different than anything Q.T. has ever done. At first I didn't like it, because I was hoping for another Pulp fiction, but after I let it stand on its own I realized it is very good."
4,From Dusk to Dawn,"What a surprise! All of the stars and a bizzare plot. A bit on the gory side but, keeps you on the edge of your chair. I would recommend it to fans of these actors. I know they had fun making this film, you can tell."
1,Lots of violence and gore. The acting and special effects are more like those a comic book than a serious movie.,This movie contains a lot of violence and gore. However the acting and special effects are more like those of a comic book than a serious film. There is neither suspense nor horror in this movie.
2,Fair,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a very silly film, with way too much violence, and too less story. The acting is good but the film is bad. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
4,If you loved From Dusk Till Dawn....,"Great behind the scenes stuff from From Dusk Till Dawn, but so much more! Some really interesting information about movie making and the politics that surround it. Really get to see these actors/directors/film makers in their element, and what it really takes to make a film like this. Gave me a new appreciation for this movie and for film making in general. Definately worth watching!!"
2,"Don't Do ""Dawn""","Miserable Blu Ray release of a great movie. The picture is cropped from its original aspect ratio, the sound is sub-par, and the picture quality is all over the map. There are moments when the picture is stellar, especially during the beginning moments of the film in the outdoors. Colors pop and the picture is crisp and clear, but then it will suddenly change to something comparable to VHS.Extras? Forget it! Nothing...zero...zilch.It's a shame that one of Miramax's best titles wound up in the hands of this company, who produced such a horribly shoddy transfer of this film. Skip it and stick with your DVD."
4,Classic,"THere's not much I can say here that others haven't. This really is a classic vampire movie, with Tarantino's own touch, you can tell by the camerawork and what have you. Some people don't like that, but personally I think it is a good film nonetheless, and worth checking out whether you're a Tarantino or vampire fan."
1,I don't like this.,I feel that this is one of those films that I feel is a part of the contemporary polarization. Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines. It's one extreme or the other. No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious. Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that.
1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"This movie was insultinly bad. It went from a very involved crime story, which was potentially very good, to several terrible, terrible action sequences following one another. How could anyone like this movie? How did they get such great actors to be in such a discustingly bad and rediculus movie? Bottom line: The director should be put in jail for steeling thousands of people's time."
3,good times...,"woah -- 128 reviews? this is insane!! yeah, the cd rocks...but the only reason to buy the cd is song #13 - by tito & tarantula...""after dark""...the rest is just rock, not so extraordinary...and mostly found elsewhere. but i suppose #13 is also...but if not, buying a cd for a gem like this could not be wrong... in any way...."
3,A bar,"Everyone is a vampire. So how do they not bit? Holy water, rubbers,pencils, and sunlight. Seth loses his brother."
2,A few good scenes at the end but mostly lame.,"I thought this movie was going to rock. Sadly, it did not rock. The only good scenes were with Cheech. The few scenes he was in were hilarious.The action and violence did not start until the movie was more than half over.Basically Clooney and his gang of hostages barge in on a very festive mexican stip joint. Later they find out it is run by a psycho array of vampires. Towards the end of the film they fight off a hundred vampires that come out of nowhere.This movie had a pretty simple plot and it wasn't too interesting either.Some of the vampires looked scary while others looked corny.Overall I was disappointed.My favorite Tarantino movie is Kill Bill 2.Favorite vampire movies are Interview with the vampire, Blade 2, and Dracula."
1,From Dusk To Yawn,"From Dusk Till Dawn is an awful movie. It is really bad. It's a shame. It had a lot of great, talented people in it and a promising premise. It completely went out of control. It was too much!. It was too much to the point where you lose hold of it and completely lose interest immediatley. An awful, awful waste of a movie."
1,Regret having paid to see this,"Some horror films tray to present a moral message or political opinion. This film presents a great way to waste your money. I was looking for the action sequences claimed to be soo great or anything to justify entertainment. Well, it was nice to see a few of my favorite actors walk and talk.You are tossed into this film and will try to see if the story is going anywhere. It isn't. It's just suggestive summertime mindless celluloid fodder. Pass on this one."
5,Does The TT Twister Accept Credit Cards?...,"FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a bloody hilarious vampire movie w/ loads of Rodriguez action and Tarantino attitude. Sort of a strange mixture of DESPERADO, PULP FICTION, and a really good under-siege-by monsters flick; this movie starts w/ a bang and just keeps exploding! Tarantino and Clooney are as humorous as they are menacing as the notorious Gecko brothers. Their crime spree takes them to a biker / trucker bar in Mexico, where they find themselves under attack by an army of voracious, blood-sucking dancers (of the exotic variety), led by the unbelievably hot Salma Hayek! Her snake dance is seered in my memory forever! Watch as the Geckos, aided by their hostages (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis), along w/ a biker (Tom Savini) and a Viet Nam vet (Fred Williamson) do battle w/ the hordes of hell! Taking FDTD seriously is not an option. Just go with it and enjoy the fun..."
2,Still a fan of series,I agree that this installment is not as enjoyable as others in the series. The two plot lines never seem to gel. However it did not stop me from continuing on with the series. If you enjoyed the novels preceding this one I encourage you to read on. Some of the more recent installments have better plot lines to keep the reader interested.
5,A Long Shadow,"As usual, Charles Todd challenges the reader to better understand Inspector Ian Rutledge and the voice in the back of his head and the plot and its idiosyncracies. In this book there is a sniper determined to kill Inspector Rutledge and a crime to solve. Other crimes--or possible crimes--are revealed and the book hooks you.Inspector Rutledge is, as always, a compelling person which the reader hopes will eventually find some sort of peace in his life, but perhaps the intriguing part of his character is that this peace is not likely to happen anytime soon.I make sure I don't have anything else to do for a couple of days when I buy Charles Todd's books because they tend to suck you in and keep you until the book is finished."
1,Terrible quality,Pages were folded over cover was ripped off. Terrible quality and unexpected when I received it in the mail. The quality online said used not torn to shreds
4,A very nice recording,"I had not heard of any of the musicians prior to purchasing this CD. Frankly, the price attracted me initially. After listening to it a few times it really begins to grow on you. The quartets are played beautifully and the sound is first-rate. At the price, it is also a good bargain. I recommend it highly."
1,Waste of money,They needed a name and got Daryl Hannah. She must of needed the money. She is in about 10 mins of the movie and the movie really bites. Tx chainsaw meets really poorly done movie. Basically it bites.
2,Not too impressed,"I totally agree with axe2grind, one thing I wanted to add was ""Billy"" the hillbilly had the straightest, whitest teeth I have ever seen!! It's amazing, him being chained in a small dark room for most of his life and all. They totally distracted me from the schlock going on in the movie!!!"
2,STAND BY YOUR MAN..EVEN IF HE EATS YOUR FRIENDS,"This is one of the oddest zombie films yet. The movie focuses on a newlywed couple with plans of having babies and going off to Portugal to live happily ever after. WRONG!No sooner than our couple arrives at their honeymoon site than the hubby is bitten by a zombie who comes out of the ocean? (Where in the world did he come from?). Anyway, the hubby dies for ten minutes but miraculously recovers---with a fiendish appetite.The movie tries for some dark humor, but the pace is so slow and the characters reaction so unbelievable, that the laughs are more unintentional I think than written. The cast is pretty bad, although Tracy Coogan as the wife has a certain Diane Laneish coquettishness and toughness that almost makes her convincing. Probably the first zombie love story, it tries hard but ultimately achieves very little."
1,Woof,"I was told by a friend that this was a really, really, really, really bad movie.I bought it because it was cheap and I wanted to see just what his idea of areally, really, really, really bad movie was.OK - now I know. The plot was lame and hard to follow, the acting was lousy and there wasn't any gratuitious nudity to at least give you a reason to watch it.Save your money and time and don't bother with this one, unless of course you are really zonked on marijuana. That might make this movie interesting! Confusing, especially loaded, but interesting."
2,It's OK to eat everyone but Me,"This film was ridiculous. This woman KNOWS he is killing strangers and eating them and then KNOWS he started killing friends. But, only when he starts after HER does her love for him desert her. Any normal woman would have left her husband when his skin started rotting and/or he ate his first victim."
2,"GOOD IDEA, BUT POORLY EXECUTED!","I know I'm going to get it for this one, but this movie is pretty bad. While I like the premise, the film is too tame to be scary, played too straight to be funny and too silly to care about the characters! There I said it!....in short this movie is a c r a p - fest! If the makers of this film had just picked a path and stayed on it, this would be a much better film.I won't even touch on the plot holes as the film is too absurd to be taken, for anything other than someone's fantasy nightmare! It plays like an episode of 'Tales From The Dark Side'(not one of the better ones). On the plus side the low budget has good acting and FX. If you must see it, watch it on cable, it's not for everyone's taste ....certainly not mine.......and yes, I do get the film. OK, I'm bracing myself...........!"
2,Beats Day of the Dead 2 at least,"Wow, is this some really horrible stuff! Acting, effects, plot. It all blows! to the reviewer who said this movie makes you think...yeah think about shutting the crap OFF! It isn't anything like a George A Romero zombie flick, ok so that's fine, but it neither scary nor thought provoking as the guy who gave it 5 stars. He knows the director and therefore is doing some SERIOUS brown nosing. TRUST ME, next to Day of the Dead 2:Contagium, this is the WORST zombie movie of all time. there is nothing redeemable about this. I give it 2 stars for 1 simple reason, the make out scenes in the beginning are hot, especially when he pulls off her panties. Other than this, man I have nothing but laughing to do at the idiotic minds responsible for this laughable, pathetic crap of a movie!"
3,Better than expected,"Frist off, the acting is GOOD which is a far cry for a majority of horror films, and most zombie films. The gore is decent, but the storyline is compelling enough to carry the film. I'd recommend this for under $10. I was pleasently surprised by this movie."
2,a typical college student's homework,"for me it is all right. not too bad, not so good either. a typical film school student's homework. a personal, ""experimental"" (in fact, with much cliche) portfolio. but it is understandable. very common among the film students. not worthwhile to buy it--unless you have so much money for charity."
3,Silver Sun catches a bit of power pop rays,"The Cheap Trick comparisons seem to follow Silver Sun around, and generally that's not too far off, a marriage of chirpy 60's harmonies and crunchy guitars *cough* Matthew Sweet, New Pornographers. The catchiness of this album is infectious, fusing melodic vocals and buzzed-up riffs. Just think the bouncy power-pop of a Teenage Fanclub and Sugar (or perhaps even Suede's debut) meeting the silky melodies of Jellyfish or Sloan. Silver Sun's self-titled tends to be namedropped as an overlooked power-pop gem, unless you discover it for yourself of course."
4,Pretty good :-),"In this 55 minute workout, you'll sweat quite a bit. I like it - it's a good low impact workout with easy to follow routines. Tracey is a good instructor. She's enthusiastic and motivating which I like.You do the aerobics barefoot and it flows really well. It's dancey, but in a good way - not complicated. Then there is yoga type toning and you use weights to work more than one muscle group at once. It makes it a little different from other workouts I've done and the fact that it's set outdoors is a nice change of pace and makes it fresh. In this dvd you will get a full body workout and feel good for it afterwards. This is a great workout for beginners because it's not too intimidating and it's very easy to follow. I like it and think you will too."
5,Spy Kids Soundtrack! It ROCKS!,"I tried to find this CD everywhere in stores, but of course it was to old so no one had it! I went online found it and bought it! Its a great CD! the order came so fast!!!! I love it! If your looking for this CD get it from this sender if he/she has more! its great!Thanks!!"
5,Stories with a Moral,"I am a fan of simplicity, beautifully illustrated..and I mean BEAUTIFULLY !! stories with Life Lessons .Another book to 'pass down'."
3,A good buy,I love reading some of the stories to my 4 year old. Some stories are very good but some I don't find it appropriate to read to my 5 year old.
5,Best Stand-Up,"He is Hilarious. If you like the Wayans Bros. you'll love this Stand-Up I have watched this DVD like a million times i also recommend ""my wife and kids"" he is also in that show."
4,Very good live Sabbath cd,"I really enjoy this live cd alot. While I am partial to Sabbath w/Dio on vocals I can definitely listen to and enjoy the Martin era recordings. If you are a Sabbath fan and can find this cd, I would recommend you go ahead and get it."
4,Decent DVD,"This DVD is for a dancer that sees beyond appearances. One can never expect too much out of anything. This is a decent DVD, the teacher's intentions were good. This is something you could use to practice your shimmies. Celeste is a good teacher, the movements are clear and her hand movements are beautiful. Hey! One can learn a lot even from videos that are not that great, but everybody has different tastes. When it comes to Bellydance we have to be realistic, each individual has different needs and likes or dislikes. I don't want to judge this DVD too harshly. As I mentioned again it is an ok DVD for the one who is willing to practice and perfect her shimmies. Good for beginners with lots of repetitions."
4,Nice little pouch for the price,"My old electrical tool pouch finally wore out, and looking at the photo, I thought this one would be a good replacement. The cost was very reasonable, so I ordered it. Turns out, it's smaller than I thought. My old pouch held all my most-often-used hand tools, with room for a couple extra. This one does not hold as many tools, but it will do for now. It's very nice and high quality, but be aware that it's fairly small."
5,Tough and Handy,"This pouch is a great pouch because it has 2 big pockets, and then the other 5 pockets are designated areas for either a screwdriver or pliers. The tool belt loop is big to fit multiple sizes of belts. This is a great pouch!"
4,Freedom with constraints,"Llywelyn takes her historical fiction of ""The Irish Century"" through the depression and WWII in the third volume. As with the earlier installments, Llywelyn's balance between historical detail and just plain story-telling is near pitch-perfect. The most intriguing character from the second installment (1921), Ursula Halloran is central to the '1949' story, as she struggles with the conflict between her un-stinting support of the revolution and her desire to see newly won freedoms equally available to women as well and men."
4,Loved it!,"Terrific series for understanding Irish history. Enjoyable reading start to finish. Leaves you wanting more, and, fortunately, there is more."
4,Thomas Jefferson recommendation,"In a letter to John Norvell in 1807, Jefferson discussed the principles of civil society and the proper organization of government: ""I think there does not exist a good elementary work on the organization of society into civil government: I mean a work which presents in one full and comprehensive view the system of principles on which such an organization should be founded, according to the rights of nature. For want of a single work of that character, I should recommend Locke on Government, Sidney, Priestley's Essay on the First Principles of Government, Chipman's Principles of Government, and the Federalist.""Jefferson to John Norvell, June 11,1807, ibid., XI, 222-223"
2,Sperry Top-Sider Shoe,"I had difficulty rating this, as I am waiting for a replacement. The shoes were of excellent quality, but unfortunately too small. I returned them for replacement, and am still waiting for my replacement pair. Ordering clothes or shoes from overseas is problematic, as sizes differ depending on country of manufacture. If I can get my size I will buy them.If you order from Amazon remember to add in postage to your cost as this can be quite expensive if you live overseas.I live in New Zealand."
4,Great shoe at a Great price,"Shoe is great, the price even better. everything shipped the way I expected. Hope to find more deals in the near future. Only thing is my son likes to take a loose the shoe string"
3,Good read,Interesting read...putting together thread after thread. I enjoy reading Doyle and was not disappointed with this book of short tales
4,Last of the Legions,"A very entertaining collection of tales, mostly of the Roman Empire, in various locations and periods. It includes the Roman withdrawal from Britain, first encounter with invading Huns, and an encounter with the Prophet Mohammed while he still had only a handful of followers."
1,I didn't order this and it has not arrived.;,Since when do I order anything in this series not on cd or tape? NEVER. What is this all about?
3,Mae West in Sextette,"This is not a great movie, but it's Mae West!! She's about 81 in this and looking pretty strange, but the cast is fun and it's cool to see her still wanting to make a dent at that age. It's one of those that is so bad, you just can't help but watch it. I saw it when it was first released and had a ball in the theater, simply because EVERYONE had an ""illegal smile"" in the audience, so to speak. It's cheap, buy it, watch it, pass it along!"
3,Good book on Livestock Guarding Dogs!,All in all this is a pretty good book on a subject that is hard to find information on. The author does a pretty good job explaining about raising and making use of a Livestock Guarding Dog.
5,Inspirational,"Those familiar with the novels and short stories of Louis L'Amour will not be surprised to learn that his calendars are as exciting and inspirational as his books. Each month a picture depicts a character or ""scene"" from one of his stories along with a brief quote from the story. For me these provide an inspiration for my own writing as well aspainting a picture of the land and the individuals of the American West. February, for instance, has a brief excerpt from ""The Man from the Broken Hills"" beneath a painting of Milo Talon, ""...We will ride far lands where the only companions are wind and rain and sun."" Sit back, let your eyes gaze on the art, read the excerpt, let your mind roam freely..and if you haven't already, start reading all of his books."
2,I'm the minority opinion,"I can't get it to stay on my nails. Almost all of it peels off within 24 hours. I'm new to this product, so I'm going to keep trying. Previously I've used Nail Envy by OPI and didn't have any issues. I was curious about the reviews to see if anyone else had the same problem, but I see they don't. I don't wear polish, so don't know if that makes a difference, but the instructions say you don't need to."
5,Nail Tek Hydration IV,I have always had soft fingernails and finally I have found a product that has helped me have hard nails. I highly recommend this product!
5,Finally Available Remastered!!!,This was a hard title to find. I will still keep my original copy.The remastering is great and you get 3 bonus tracks. Very good debut album by Earl. Highly Recommend!!!
4,Excellent,"This book is a technical treatment of the field of of historical linguistics, the study of language change over time. It is probably the best technical book on the subject, better than Trask's book which is somewhat less technical and has more ""fluff"".This book is a useful resource for anyone wishing to study how languages change and modify over time."
3,Interesting storyline involving murder and spying,This novel is interesting if you like mysteries. It is well written and the chracters are interesting. The work is pure fiction and has very little historical value for someone wanting facts. I bought the book looking for facts and what I got was a great read of fiction. The storyline is interesting involving murder and spying. A good cold war U.S. vs KGB story.
5,Outdoor furniture,I purchased two of these cushions and they fit my chairs and are very comfortable. I have lasted much longer than what came with the chairs.
1,poor quality,"This is one hugely disappointing CD. The sound quality is poor--you could hear the scratches and pops of the original record. The recording itself--made off a radio broadcast--is not too great to begin with. What's more annoying--for me anyway--is that the radio announcer kept coming on to introduce this and that song, thus ruining whatever mood the album and the individual songs produce in the listener. For god's sake, he even came on DURING ""Moonlight Serenade"" to utter some nonsense or other. Now does this sound like your idea of a good time?"
2,For $200...pick a different reference book,"I was dissapointed in the accuracy of information in ""The Enycyclopedia of TV Game Shows"". While the selection of photos from Schwartz's and Wostbrock personal collection is nice; the inaccurate information is something else.""Sale of the Century"" is one page with such misinformation; many other entries have inaccurate information as well.Well the effort is nice; I'm afraid the authors need to leave with some nice parting gifts."
5,Game show history at its best!,"Wink Martindale, Alex Trebeck, Bob Barker, Pat Zajac, Bob Eubanks, Bill Cullen, Allen Ludden, Gene Rayburn and Johnny Carson are just a few of the game show hosts we grew up with and they're here in this book.Relive so many memories from The Price is Right, Let's Make a Deal, Family Feud, Double Dare and so many others. You find out about the show, who hosted it and what the game was about.Sit down and take time to look back at what is the most complete book on television's hottest, brightest weirdest and worst games shows in history all packed into this 350 plus page scrapbook.Once again Facts on File has given you a real winner and this one is sure to please everyone. By the way who hosted Bank on the Stars? Or Child's Play? Or better yet Pass the Buck?"
4,Needs updating...,"Before syndicated talk shows dominated the morning lineups, there were network game shows.This book serves as an almanac for the many game shows that occupied those timeslots.Since it was published in early 1999, the third edition does not cover current versions of Hollywood Squares, Family Feud, Who Wants To Be A Millionair or Weakest Link. Nor does it cover recent short lived game shows such as Twenty One or Winning Lines.For somone concerned about game shows of the past, this book is fine. For the game shows of the current (Except for Price Is Right, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!), this book is seriously in need of an update."
3,"Lots of great theory and concepts, few techniques","This is a great book for anyone at any level, but don't rely on it for techniques or for a real ""hands on"" how-to approach. Bachman obviously knows a lot about his subject, and has thought long and deeply about many aspects of the art (some I had never before considered). If you are looking for basic techniques, lots of pictures, kata forms, or any of the traditional instructional materials, look elsewhere. If you have the fundamentals down and are seeking a way to apply them, this is a ""must""."
4,A great guide for beginners!,"For anyone considering taking up the practice of Martial Arts and more specifically Kenpo, this book is a MUST read. It is an excellent source of basic information as well as insight into the ""how's"" and ""why's"" of the many blocks and attacks in Kenpo. I highly recommend this book for anyone's collection."
5,"One of the best ""musicals"" on Broadway for sure!","Bought this for my baby sister as our family was brought up on ""Broadway"" musicals and the wonderful music. My sister said it was just terrific and listens to it alot. All you Broadway ""buffs"" I recommend getting this for your collection."
4,Annie Get Your Gun - still a classic!,"Some of Irving Berlin's best music. Every song a classic, performed by a wonderful cast including the First Lady of Broadway, Ethel Merman!"
5,30 years to soon,"Great stuff 30 years to soon. Too hippie for country, too country for the hippies. A must for the country / rock collection."
3,Worth the price I payed,"This CD is more country than what passes for country music now days, but if your looking for honkytonk and sawdust floors this CD is not for you."
1,Biggest mistake I ever made.,"I remember listening to Wild Horses when I was young and thought I would buy this disc because I always liked this version better than the Rolling Stones version. I didn't know what was on the rest of the disc and after reading about how it was country rock thought I would give it a try. After putting it in my C.D. in my truck and listening to the first tune I knew I had made a big, big mistake. Every song that it played was that whiney-ass country music that rednecks seem to love. This is NOT country rock! It is pure country music and the kind of music most people who listen to rock and roll absolutely hate. I went through all 21 songs to get to number 22, Wild Horses, the only song I like. It will be collecting dust until I either throw it out the window or trash it. It's that bad."
4,Memphis Soul Stew,"1973-74. Elvis, post-Aloha, and in the throes of divorce proceedings. Without the (waning) excitement of live concerts what other motivation was there to seek out new material?Fortunately, the love of music. As this album testifies, the past still provided the adventurous artist with enough richness and diversity to excite even the most jaded performer. Chuck Berry's anthemic title track is the prime example, as Elvis pours all of his considerable energy into making this song his own. Add to this some beautifully performed contemporary numbers such as ""Your Love's Been A Long Time Coming"", ""Thinking Of You"" and Waylon Jennings's ""You Asked Me To"", and ""Promised Land"" delivers the sense of purpose and energy lacking in many of his other album releases."
5,The Best Elvis album ever!!!,Elvis was great in this album.Great voice and great songs.This is Elvis' absolute best and the best song of course is the Promised Land. You should really pick up a copy today.
3,ELVIS (NEED I SAY MORE),"HELP ME IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS BY ELVIS,,NOT GREAT BUT GOOD CD IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY ELVIS"
2,Book condition,"The pages were in great condition and the book looked like new, EXCEPT - IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN STORED ON ITS SIDE IN MUD - made me a little scared to even try to read it."
3,Often humorous often boorish,"A masterwork of self indulgence. One gets the feeling asyou labor through Fine that the author wrote this either while on an opuim binge or recovering from to much sun. Chock full of assinine puns and semi-autobiographical trash. Shem is excellent as a writer of clinical psychology, he should stick to that area and leave cheesy novels to the rest of us. Leave this one home if your going on vacation!"
3,Gentle and lovely,"3.5 stars---This a gentle and lovely collection of songs. Holly Williams has a pleasant, almost perfect for alt-country voice and the arrangements are spare, many times no more than piano and acoustic guitar. She is a gifted lyricist and must have a lot of her grandfather in her as these are songs of love and loss and dealing with the pain that life deals out to you. The problems would be weak melodies on some songs and not enough variation in the arrangement and tempo. Every song meanders along at the same pace and as the CD wears on, you lose a little interest. My favorite songs would be Sometimes, Everybody's Waiting for a Chance and I'll Only Break your Heart."
4,Hank Jrs girl follows in her fathers footsteps.,"What can I say? I purchased a copy of 23 year old singer/songwriter Holly Williams CD ""The Ones We Never Knew"" and I have to tell you that I thought it was incredible. It is an album of pure folk/pop similar to Bob Dylan and Jewel, lyrically Holly Williams deals with everyday issues like love and relationships ""Take Me Down"", ""I`d Only Break Your Heart"", regret and loss ""Sometimes"", ""Would You Still Have Fallen?"" and even religion ""Between The Lines"". Holly has a passionate voice that cannot fail to touch you and her melodic flair shines brightly throughout the albums 12 tracks. Be it with a guitar, piano or a full band the stripped down approach to this debut makes it an intimate and poignant listening experience. The only flaw I do have is that ""The Ones"" is rather ballad heavy and can on occassion get a little tedious. All in all a great debut, Her granddfather Hank would`ve been proud."
3,Working on a Good Thing,"The singer-songwriter era is one of my favorites. This set by Holly Williams who boasts an exceptional country pedigree has many nice moments. Williams' voice is strong with a breathy Janis Ian-like expressiveness. As a lyricist, she writes intricate tales as on the opener where she sings, ""I wish I was a fine wine; I wish I were a good drug; and if I were Jesus, maybe I could heal us all."" This set is well produced with the arrangements being full and flush as with the strings on the orchestral ""Everybody's Waiting for a Change."" The major problem with the set is that it sounds a bit faceless with the tunes blending into each other and the melodies not being distinctive enough to really grip us emotionally. ""Man in the Making"" does leap out a bit with some energy. This is a great first step. Time will tell how her talents will develop."
4,"New directions for Getz, new life for Corea and company","Prior to forming the innovative fusion band Return To Forever, Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and Airto Moreira served valuable apprenticeships with tenor legend Stan Getz. On this hot classic these four stellar players joined with ex-Miles Davis drummer Tony Williams and brought Getz into the electric-jazz era with a powerful kick. The main highlight is the earth-shaking romp through Corea's up-tempo Latin groove ""La Fiesta"", with the pianist conjuring images of Barcelona table dances and Getz pouring on the fire with a fresh new vigor. Some of Getz' subsequent electric albums (such as ""Children of the World"" on Columbia) were sodden, meandering efforts with few stimulating moments, but ""Captain Marvel"" documents a great band with the tenorman on the threshold of new discoveries. A must-have."
3,Not the one I wanted,"Saw the BMW film, love the song but can't find it anywhere. If anyone know where I can get the song Unicornio sung by Cecilia Noel(not Silvio Rodriguez), please email me at cmike620@excite.com."
4,~AGE~OF~MYTHOLOGY~,This is a good game to get. You can do alot. The campain mode is fun but can be hard at times. You can even make your own map. One of the best parts is the online play. There is Quick setup (the games you play are rated.) And there are Advance setup (the games you play are not rated.) I think you should do the advance setup first to get up your skills then try quick setup when you think your ready. If you press the F4 key it will show you who may be doing better in the game. There are codes to this game but i'll not tell you in my review.This is a fun game to have.
3,OVERALL SCORE: (B-/C+),"Not as good as, Age of Empires, too fake/hokey, not nearly as much fun to play. Only improvement is the farmers only need to be told to start a farm once, not every time the farm is exhausted [big improvement in game play].OVERALL SCORE: (B-/C+)PLAYABILITY: (B+), PLOT: (C-),ACTION/COMBAT: (B-), ANTAGONISTS: (C-), Graphics: (A-),AGE LEVEL: (PG)"
5,FANTASTIC!,"Age of Mythology is by far the best game I have played in months. It combines the Empire Building of the first 2, AOE and AOK, with gods and myths, which makes it all the more interesting. The graphics are vastly improved from the earlier editions, with an nice new 3D engine. The campaigns were a highlight also. 35 levels and 65 cutscenes, and only 2 of the 110 were bad! Leading the Atlanteans was great. However, the best parts of the game was using the god powers. These could change a game in a second, and really made it interesting. This is a great game that I strongly recommend, even if you have not played the first 2 games."
3,"Same old, same old..","Ok, I did not expect anything different from Age of Kings when I bought this game. I wanted just more of the same and this is what I got. So in terms of innovation, this game does not deliver anything more than it's predecessors. It may be more fun if you're new to Age of Empires, and in that case I suggest that you by the Age of Empires - Age of Kings version of the game."
3,Its Fun...For A While...,If you can stand being in a game for a while and building up your army then this is your game.This game doesn't require much thinking besides thinking what to get to counter your enemys army.It runs on a rock-paper-scissors type of gameplay as in if someone has say melee you would counter them with range or something.Then the range would be countered by say A fast type of monster.The only good part about this game is the God powers.They are simply awesome! I loved watching fireballs drop down on a army.Besides that there aren't a lot of people online and it has some bugs.
3,a disapointment,"After waiting anxiously for a year for AOM, all I can say is that it doesn't come close to AOE. Most of the graphics aren't as good, the game doesn't have as many options and it's not very good all around. It's still an okay game, but nothing at all like I expected."
3,Gameplay does not live to expectations.,"First of all, this game is beautiful. The graphics and sound are phenominal. From the fish swimming around in the transparent oceans to the character animations, it just looks awesome.That aside, I've been playing the AoE franchise since it first came out and I guess I was expecting more from this game. The maps seem too small, and the civs are so different, and playing different civ's makes it like a different game which tends to have people move towards focusing on a specific civilization because the learning curve on each one is so different.The single player campaign is pretty good, but the staying power AoE & AoE2 had came from multiplayer gaming... This one just won't make it."
5,A Great Game - definate top 5,"Age of Mythology lets you play as three distinct races, the Greek, Norse, and Egyptian. Each has its own pros and cons, perfectly balencing them out. The Age advancement feature lets YOU choose the gods to worship. Each different god(or godess) confers unique benifits, divine powers, and mythical beings onn your race. Customizeable difficulty allows your skill level to be nurtured.Additional features include a epic, captivating campaign, great online multiplayer, and a powerful world editor.The graphics are great and the soud effects are amazing. The music is top-notch, out of all games, I would say this has the best soundtrack. Gameplay will not leave you wanting more.The only problem with this game is that one unit, the Greek Colossus, is a overwhelmingly powerful unit in great numbers.This game is a great strategy game that I enjoy immensly."
1,OMG!,"I bought this game expecting the best RTS game to date but instead I got a rehash of every game of this nature ever released. This game is boooooooring. I beat it my first day playing it, on the hardest level because it's so easy. The characters/units are uninteresting and there is nothing really that good to say about the battles."
2,A step backwards,"I've bought all of the ""Age of..."" games and have enjoyed them more and more with each new release. However, Age of Mythology has broken this trend and taken a step backwards in many ways. The only positive thing is the improved graphics. Everything else is worse. The number of possible opponents is fewer, the world (playing field) sizes are fewer and smaller, the number of levels of difficulty is fewer. In the last regard especially it suffers. The step in difficulty from easy to moderate is too large, from too passive to too aggresive opponents in one step. The game also lacks any feeling of strategy other than ""build as fast as you can and then throw everything at your opponent"". The small world sizes are a part of the reason for this as well and make anything other than 1 on 1 matches too crowded. Save your money and wait for the next one."
4,worth the money,"I am a huge AoE and AoK fan, so learning to play the game took almost no time since the controls are very similar. The graphics and cinematics and aweseome. Although there are only three playable races (the egyptians, the greek and the norse) they are all so different that it makes it really fun to learn how to play all of them. The single player campaign is, I believe, the best part of the game. The story is really interesting, and intertwines many different stories from ancient mythology, a fact that a world history buff like me appreciates. Random map and mulitplayer games are nothing really new...its just like slipping on the old AoE shoe. Overall, this game is a great RTS and worthy of being added to any strategy gamers collection."
3,"Good game, but nothing new","This is a good game, but it's nothing too exciting. You basically build up an army and go fight your opponents. You start with basic units and through an enormous number of upgrades you can get some powerful units. You can build a ton of units, which is fun if you like to destroy your opponents by brute force. There are a lot of options for units and abilities (and by choosing gods). You get a certain number of special ""Hero"" units depending on how far you've progressed through the game. Each Hero gets special abilities. However you don't get to control your hero's abilities. You also get one special ability/miracle for each age of gameplay; the ability is nice, but it's frustrating since you only get one shot. I have not played completely through this game because I got bored.If you want something better, try Warcraft 3. It's a better game overall."
5,SImply the Best,"The depth of game play, quality of graphics and AI in this game make it the most outstanding RTS. The rich array of units and the well balanced differences between races and gods makes the game extremely challenging and multiplayer games totally rock. This game will win over all the Age of Empires fans and create a heap more. definitely the game of the year."
5,Best strategy game,"I am a big fan of the Age series and I just pre-ordered this game, I've rea a lot of reviews and downloaded lots of videos and screenshots and the trial version. This is the best game that I have ever seen. Although it is different from Age of Kings, all the features that i liked have stayed and even better features have come, like the graphics, which are amazing.To the gamer from football town ( the one that gave 1 star): how did you buy it and played it in October 24 if it was released November 1st?"
3,Another copy from microsoft,"Age of empires was a bad copy of Warcraft II and Age of Mythology is a bad copy of Warcraft III. If one has played too much the original games and wants something new can try Microsoft's copies, otherwise they do not worth."
2,They should've made Age of Imperialism...,"I was really annoyed when ensemble said they would be making AoM instead of the next ""age"" game, perhaps ""Age of Imperialism"", which would go from the colonial period to perhaps the mid-1800s. But since they were making it anyway I thought I might as well try it out. It definitely didn't have the same feel as the other age games. Sure, you started out with a town center and some villagers and a scout, but the 3d just looks bad. And the sounds weren't very good either. And only 3 races! I was very disappointed. I hope they hurry up and deliver the next age game and make it right next time!"
2,too bad,"can u image that this game would make a super computer which is bulit in intel P4 2.1G, Geforce4 Mx440, 512 viking Rambus Rimm Memory... restart a few times when I was playing it?"
1,"If its not broken, don't fix it.","If you are a Age of empire loyalist, do not waste your money on this stinker. After installing it and trying it once, I uninstalled it and went back to Age 1 and 2. Its nothing like the originals. I'm a little shocked MSFT could blow a sure thing so badly."
4,Fun but short,"As much as I enjoyed this game, I was saddened that it only took a little over a week to beat.The single player campaign was very interesting to play. My favorite section of course was the Eqyptian campaigns.I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the ""Age of _____"" series."
5,Age of Myth - Great Game,The interface and commands are still the same for the experienced AOE player. However the civilizations are completely different from each other and you really have to weight out your options on who to use. It's not as easy to build a huge army and wipe some one out when they have the right civ and units with some God power. Makes the game more calculating and Strategic.The graphics are unbelievable and this will easily fit into my AOE library. (SOMETHING HARD TO DO!) Get's my vote for Game of the Year! My Recommendation: Buy it!
5,somebody stop me![.],"I have been playing this game for two weeks now and I can't stop playing it! Lots of fun and lots of different ways to play. Online with multiplayer or with the random map that is like a quick game. I played through the entire story and it was fun! I loved becoming the hero and the troops do what I tell them. Man this is cool....It (as a game) is not easy unless you want the easy setting because the Titan setting will spank you. You can get another chance right away if you don't make it. Anyway, the game is well worth the money and fun to no end. GET IT TODAY![.]"
1,Buyer beware--game not compatible with many computers,"Like other reviewers, I've been disappointed by recent Microsoft Game releases. AOM is the last straw. There are literally hundreds of video adapters that AOM does not support. My home PC is right out of the box and won't run AOM. Think twice before buying this game."
4,FUn but needs a lot of prac,This game will give you ours of thinking and patienceone of the best games of the 2k year...
3,"good, but alot missing","Good game, better than warcraft, but try Warlords battlecry2 and you'll never play this again. A key element Warlords has is that you can carry units from battle to battle, not many but a few to make things much more interesting. try Warlords battlecry two before you try this, it's like playing diablo and AOE rolled into one."
2,disappointment,"The first thing I noticed was that the units, buildings, and interface were almost identical to AOE. Though Micrsoft claims that it is 3D for some unknown reason you can't rotate the camera. Nothing is 3D except for some of the units which are kinda 3D. Same boring tactics that are used in Aoe. Just more rushing. Not much when compared to Ground control or Earth 2150. It is better than Starcraft but not by much. Microsoft has donea very bad job at their first attempt to create a 3D game. Also the sides are very similar. Hardly any strategy involved. Por lighting and speciial effects."
3,good but there is better,"if your love age of empires and things like that dont bother to read this review because i dis it a lot. there is starcraft, warcraft 3, 3d pong if i dare say. what im trying to get at is that if your going to buy a game get ethier starcraft or warcraft 3 made by blizzard my favorite company (kick microsoft's ***. this game didnt feel like the graghis arnt warcraft 3 and the play didnt feel like starcraft and if you dont get a good game and your getting out ranked by starcraft an old game that i still like then dont buy this game my about any game made by blizzard and your going to be happy"
2,amazing,unique program which can cause windows 2000 halt.i have never seen such a program before.this is actually 2D game not real 3Dwhat good it is if the only 3D effect is rotating maps.they spoiled the age of empire series totally
1,Bland and done before,"This is basically just like any other ""Age of"" but with a new engine and new units. The graphics are bland and stale. The units don't look as if they belong in the same army. They're just a rabble of disimilar troops.If you want a real strategy game check out Winter of the Wolf the Battle Realms expansion."
5,I dont know...,It just isnt all that fun i mean woopdie doo you kill stuff with creatures that are mythological. last some... gods are sitting around casting stupid spells all over that do absolutly nothing except counter the little creatures.!
5,Practical and entertaining,"I've read just about everything written about pugs and this is one of the better books. The tips are helpful and if you aren't aware of it, pugs have many health issues. The result of years of breeding makes for some common ailments. A good choice for pug lovers."
2,Disapointing,"This is from a series of books..Poodle,Cocker...all dogs...it has nothing really to do with pugs and some special health and disease related issues they have compared to other dogs..so disapointing and misleading..."
5,"Jesus, the guy next door","This book has brought the Gospels to life for me. Max Lucado puts a ""down home"" spin on familiar stories from the life of Jesus that reveal his closeness to humanity. Yes, he is our Savior. Yes, he never sinned. However, that does not mean that he is distant. That does not mean that he fails to understand our struggles, fears and pain.Next Door Savior is a collection of 21 powerful essays that remind us that there is no person that Jesus won't touch (Part 1), and there is no place that Jesus won't go (Part 2) as our Savior. Lucado's stories will leave you laughing, crying and marvelling at the wonderful sacrifice Jesus has made for us.Next Door Savior will help you grow from knowing *of* Jesus, to really knowing Him on a personal level, and being certain of His presence in your life.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
5,truly refreshing,"i haven't read max lucado books in awhile and I have read quite some of them. I have to say that this is one of his best written. The chapters are short but they are meaningful, each one of them that applies to different people."
5,Next Door Saviour,Subtitled 'Near enough to touch. Strong enough to trust.' Lucado explains the love of God and the work of Jesus in an everyday manner. I was moved many times as I read this book.
3,A bit on the disappointing side,"Being a bit of a Jane Austen magpie and already owning other books by Le Faye, I looked forward to gaining more background to the time period with this book. While there was much of interest, I'd have to say that overall I wouldn't recommend it. There were some inaccuracies in the plot summaries (minor, but there all the same), but the biggest problem for readers who may be new to Jane Austen was the lack of delineation between the real people (family members, friends) mentioned and characters from the books. I could see this becoming fairly confusing for someone who hasn't already read other biographical material. Still, it's a decent read and the information presented may stimulate a person's interest enough to want to find out more."
1,"Right Case, Wrong Battery","Exact same problem as the previous reviewer. But now I've made this mistake twice!! First time, 6 mos ago, I complained to Amazon, and they said that they would relabel this product to make it clear it's not for the ZR-XXX series. I assumed that had been corrected and just ordered it again on the credit from the first order! Here we go all over again. Is there an accessory kit for the ZR-200!!??"
3,"Smallish case, but overall deal is ok","I just received this package and spent 30 min trying to find a way to pack my ZR70MC into it along with the extra battery, a tape and the video cables. Basically, the case turned out to be underdesigned for the camera and the accessories you might want to have with you (no way to fit the charger). However, if you want to buy a genuine Canon battery the kit value is ok."
3,"Very great quality product, just a little too large for me...","I really did like the product, the glass is very thick, and sturdy and the whole product seems like much higher quality materials than you're paying for. Also, when all together it really does look expensive and classy and modern. However, it just didn't work for my needs. My biggest issue was the how far the shelf came off the wall, it seriously interfered with the space and people being able to walk through the area I was trying to put it in easily. Plus, in the photo it appears as if the glass shelf is right up against the wall/plastic backing, and that is NOT the case. There are at least a couple inches between the glass and the back and not only did I not like how that looked, but it added to how far out the shelf came. My father was going to try and create a new piece, so the shelf would be closer to the wall, and cut out those extra inches, but I've decided just to send it back and find something else..."
3,Deceiving,"The pictures are very deceiving. The glass does not sit flush again the wall. When aligned straight with the mount, it actually sticks out about 3 feet. You have to turn the arm & glass to the side it to get it to sit against the wall. This was a huge pain when mounting and trying to center under the tv. Just make sure you look and play around with it before you drill holes in the wall and mount. Also the glass is very heavy, and the anchors do no really help. Make sure you drill in the wood."
5,nice shelf,"The shelf is very nice, glass is thick and good looking. And it was very easy to install. Took me about 20 minutes."
2,These are useful ... if you're still living in the 90s,"They may seem sleek in the pictures, but they're actually rather large and bulky. I guess they have to be since they're designed to hold up old school CRTs and whatnot. I just wanted something to hold up a few AV components and an xbox 360.The thing that really ruins it though is just how far these things stick out from the wall. You can't really notice it in any of the pictures, but the glass is a good 8 inches from the wall. That's all wasted space. If they had just shortened the length of the arm or even made the glass bigger (I'd prefer the first) these could have worked out."
5,Component Shelf,"The component shelf is pretty strong. I bought two. One is currently holding a Yamaha Receiver which weights approx. 22bls and the other is holding a 5 disc changer/ DVD Player and a cable box. Please note that the shelf is more likely designed for something a bit bigger than your cable box, such as a receiver, DVD Player etc.Thanks,"
5,Well Worth It!!!,"I recently moved and decided to put the TV on the wall. Of course this creates a problem, what the heck do you do with the DVD, cable box and everything else? This shelf is an excellent solution. I bought 3 of these for my system and could not be happier with them. The shelf is big enough to hold just about any component. Very easy to install, strong, and looks great. Plus you can not beat the price."
5,Good product,"Good Product, had no problem installing it. Holds my cable box and dvd player with no problem whatsoever. Easy installation instructions."
5,Good product,"Got this unit to mount my satellite dish DVR and Blue Ray player. Strong, attractive and just the right size. Some complained that it sticks out of the wall too far but it needs to be in order to hold deeper components and to provide room for cables. Good product at a good price."
4,Nice Strong Shelf,"Good strong metal and glass shelf. Pleasantly surprised with the shelf glass thickness. I mounted it to the wooden studs behind the wall. My only complaint is the mounting bolts. Even though I drilled a pilot hole, I found I was stripping the Phillips head in the bolts as I screwed them into the wooden studs. Maybe the wood was just too hard. I ended up going to Home Depot and buying some hex-head lag bolts which worked so much better."
3,OmniMount ECSB Component Shelf review,"It is not big enough for my purpose, for my son's room which he has limited space to place a tv box (AT&T; and a Xbox 360 console). Also there is not a way to run the power cables straight down from the base so the cable are going all sort of which way, his room is already a mess half the time.It did not meet my expectation for size and organization.It was very easy to install."
3,Wish it would rotate more,This is a great looking product however my husband and I wish it would rotate a bit more in the mounted position.
4,Sturdy; larger than expected,"Ordered this shelf to hold an amplified antenna on in order to get better reception from a higher position in living room. Pros: It is sturdy and worth around the price paid. Cons : larger than expected- it extends about 20"" from the wall; also it requires that you drill rather large holes into a wall stud to hold it. Measurements of glass shelf are : 16 1/2 inches deep (glass) X 18"" wide (glass); with the arm underneath, it extends outward about 20"". Tempered glass is clear color."
2,Back doesn't stay on,It holds my blueray player and cable box but the plastic piece that is supposed to hide the wires is just plastic and pops off. Not very well made.
4,Just right however...,This mount was perfect for my 32inch television. It is well made and looks sleek. The reason it didn't get five stars is because my television tends to lean forward a bit as if the weight is a bit much for the mount. Not sure if it's how I installed it or that the mount works better with smaller sized televisions. Other than that I love the fact that I can swivel it since I have an open space living/kitchen area.
5,Perfecto,I needed something to hold my projector and this is perfect. It's just the right size if you don't want something sticking out like a sore thumb! It's very sturdy and a great price.
5,not too large and not too small............just right size,"This shelf was easy to install, underneath my wall-mounted HD TV. It can hold two, possibly three components, swivels around some, usefully. I recommend this if you need to get components out of the way, but still be accessible."
4,Works as described,Does what it's supposed to do. Took about 15 minutes to install. I had about 2 inches on each side after putting an old Dish Network 311 receiver on it.
3,Nice but sticks out FAR from wall,"This product is nice and can be mounted easily however, buyer beware that the shelf sticks out very far from the wall vs its appearance in the picture that it is next to the wall. We ended up pivoting the shelf to the left to make it flush with the wall, so its off-center from the TV and that is not optimal nor does it look right, but we couldn't find a better option and honestly were too lazy to return it."
4,Very happy with this product,I am very happy with this product...I have an Epson 8350 projector that is on the larger side and it fits on this shelf perfectly. The shelf was easy to install also.I do agree with other reviewers that the arm itself really cannot be tightened to the point that if it is bumped it will not move. I tried and you can still take it and move it side to side...it is not loose but it will move it pressure applied.I also was not happy with the screws that were included. Seemed like very soft metal that started to strip. I drilled pilot holes and on one I must have been a little short. As soon as the screw hit where the end the tip of the screw started to strip. Had to stop and finish screwing it in by hand instead of the power drill.Overall I like the product and am very happy with it.
4,Really nice shelf and sturdy.,"I got this to put my HD Projector on for living room viewing.It is really, really nice. Everyone who sees it is very impressed. Nice and easy to follow installation. My only beef is that some of the plastic pieces look a little cheap. Not really but slightly. Outside of that, I'd recommend buying this shelf. Its a great piece of equipment."
4,Great shelf after you get it up,"I purchased this shelf because I was looking for a lower profile shelf to hold the DVR box. This shelf is nice and fits our needs for that lower profile look I wanted. Considering the price, and that the prices of similar items in most stores is 2-3 times more, it is a great buy! The only trouble we had was a little difficulty mounting it. My husband didn't have a tool to fit the bolts that came with it and after visiting and calling a few stores to get the tool that would fit I found out that it is actually a very odd size and is mostly only used by mechanics. My husband ended up mounting it with a wrench to tighten the bolts. It worked but was just a little bit more of an inconvenience and took a little longer. We mounted it in a stud and I really wouldn't suggest mounting something this heavy that is also going to hold the weight of other items without a stud."
5,OmniMount Component Shelf,"Good Product. The Shelf is very easy to install and seems to be strong. This is a large shelf, which is exactly what I was looking for, but you may need to look at the measurements if you are looking for a dvd player shelf."
3,Stylish and functional,This is just the thing for cleaning up the video tangles and bandaids. Use this to get my home theater and Sat TV boxes up where the flat screen is. This is a large shelf with plenty of room for the components that will never fit on a shelf. the swinging arm feature is great since I bet most people don't have the exact straight mounting situation for their TV. Very easy to install.
5,Componet shelf OminiMount,"Great shelf! Easy to Mount, Looks better than the cheap mental shelves(for just a couple of extra bucks)! Highley recommend this product! Thanks Again!"
5,Great product!,I love this product. It was exactly what I was looking for and it was the perfect sizze. I would definatley recommend this product.
5,Excellent,This is a great TV stand. Holds my TV very well. It is easy to clean and moves freely. I highly recommend this product.
2,The shelf sticks out too far.,"It's a quality product with attractive looks. However, it sticks out very far from the wall. If you, unlike me, have no problem with space, then go for it. However, people who have limited space should consider another shelf. Don't worry about the picture they put up because it's deceiving ! It makes the product seem as if doesn't stick out much."
4,Great shelf,"This is a great shelf. I would highly recommend it. It's very sturdy.Few things to consider is that it is a little heavy, so make sure you have a stud on the wall to mount it. My projector works well on it. Also, the other thing to consider is that the arm is a little long, so my projector is a little further off the wall than I'd like it, but it's not bad. Just something to consider if the depth of your room is not that large and you need to keep the projector as far back as possible.Overall, a great buy for a great price..."
3,Sticks out too much,"The picture is deceiving and, while the shelf is well-made and strongly constructed, it sticks out from the wall MUCH more than it looks like it would from the picture. The picture is deceiving in the online information and it probably sticks out an additional 6 to 8 inches from the wall (beyond the shelf dimensions). It is attractive looking and simple but I was hoping it would be less intrusive."
5,Awesome................,This is an awesome piece of equipment. Looks great and elegant. Must be mounted to studs please. Overall loving this shelf.
3,Picture is Deceiving,"This is a quality unit, BUT the picture gives you the impression that the shelf does not extend out very far. The arm of the shelf extends so that the glass shelf begins 5"" from the wall and extends out to 21"" from the wall. This is the only complaint I have as the unit is otherwise well designed, sturdy, and the glass shelf(tempered) is first class. My suggestion, design a sliding extendable/retractable arm. The shelf is used to hold a direct TV receiver below a small wall hung 21"" LCD in sewing room."
5,Nice component shelf!,"This OMNIPOINT Glass component shelf was simple to install and strong enough for my VCR & Satellite Receiver. The shelf glass shelf is fixed to the support arm and the support arm can swivel left & right about 20 Degrees. The only downside is that the glass shelf and projection from my wall is a little large for my location. I wish OMNIMOUNT has several sizes of this model available. If so, then I missed seeing it. Not a problem. Have a strong drill to pre-drill the screw holes into the wall. All said, I am fully pleased with this item."
3,Does the trick ... eventually,"The shelf does what it's supposed to do, but if you're installing where there's no stud, be prepared for a headache. It's possible, but you'll need a couple trips to the hardware store for the right kind of anchors/mollies. I wouldn't do jumping jacks on it, but it holds the TiVo nicely.Would be nice if it also had a locking feature to stop the swivel. It tightens well, but not fully, so it swings if you bump it."
3,OmniMount ECSB Component Shelf,"Very sturdy, looks good but sits out too far from the wall. At least 5.5"""
5,Perfect for what we needed,"We were looking for this exact type of mount. It works great, it looks good, and was easy to install."
5,Real Review from a real guy......Looks Great!,"I am going to be blunt and to the point-Read the reviews. Bought this with an amazon gift card my wife bought me. Installed it above my wall mounted 37"" LCD in the bedroom in about 1 hour with no help at all. LOOKS GREAT! Will buy another on soon for my other bedroom."
4,Easy install,"I really had a tough time finding a low profile component shelf that would support my receiver. This was the best I was able to find...easy to install...10 minutes. Boy, what I wouldn't give for more/better choices...."
4,a little big but looks good and is very sturdy,"I'm really happy with the shelf, and although it worked out ok for me, one thing you need to think about when you get this is that it needs to be on a stud, so when you mount your tv make sure a stud is center of the tv or else your shelf will be off to the side and look stupid or you'll have you use drywall anchors which I don't feel would work well for this product do to the distance it come out from the wall and hence the torque that is applied to the fasteners."
3,it does not snap into place properly,"Overall I am happy with the shelf. It is durable, nice thick glass and easy to mount. I am disappointed with the mounting cover that goes against the wall...it does not snap into place properly and will not stay up unless glued or caulked to the wall.....I ordered two shelves and had the same problem with both."
2,Very deep shelf - too deep,"Make sure you need a shelf this deep before you drill 2 holes in you wall like I did. Most components nowadays are not that large, so a shelf this deep is not needed."
4,Classical music with contemporary rhythm sections,"The 1st cut, Mozart's Sym #40, 1st movement, is so incredible--full orchestra with rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums giving it a contemporary feel...Dvorak 9th symphony (combo of 4th and 2nd mvmnts)loses it normal darkness and comes across as an incredibly beautiful piece; the works of Beethoven and Mendelssohn come alive like never before. These arrangements are hard to get out of your head, not that you'd want to. Even the opera pieces are enjoyable for those who normally don't appreciate opera (Especially the Donizetti piece.) A few of the tracks have over-done or silly percussion/rhythm pieces, but overall, a fantastic listening experience!"
3,"Excellent Illustrations, But Story Can Be Long","Probably best suited for 5-8 year olds due to the length of the story. 4 year-olds, and younger, will grow quickly bored with this story, like its setting of Guatemala City, moves at a slow pace.But, the story is a good for more advanced children as you peer into the life of a chinese family of immigrants, who have set-up a small general store in this foreign land, and takes you through a day-in-the-life of this family.The illustrations are exceptional."
5,Awesome,"The owner of a B&B on the Isle of Skye played this CD during breakfast early this August. On the second morning of hearing it, I had to know who it was. He told us where to pick one up, and we listened to it the rest of the time driving around Scotland. Now that I am home, even my kids are addicted to it. I have since bought other CD's and they are great as well. You don't find many groups with such quality material."
4,"I use it everywhere, if any emergency! I love it!!!","Since I moved to here, my skin became sensitive and dry. It getting worse than worse when I try to use more lotion to moisture it. I was so desperate to save my face. I purchased this produce and carry on to use it for two weeks. It does help to reduced the spot and my skin getting smoother and brighter. Now I use it everywhere, if any emergency! I love it!!!"
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This book brought Jesus to me for the first time. If anyone has been bogged down by the church's interpratation of Jesus, this book will set you free!!! The scholarship is wonderful. Dr. Cain is brillant."
3,z z z z z z z z z.....................,"OK so let me summarize. It's about a boy. These two people ""plant"" something on him. In a nutshell (I guess) there are another two people like the first, they are bad. The boy has to decide which two to trust.... he chooses. I can't tell much or it gives it away, the way I summarize it anyway. Well I think it isn't easy to get interested in, it's kinda boring actually..."
3,PLOT PROBLEMS,"I am normally a big fan of Willaim Sleator, but this book is poorly written, with a lot of errors in the plot."
4,Looking for new card games to play?,"This book is great for people looking for new games to play out of the norm. Each game is explained well with rules and illustrated diagrams from actual games. It has tons of standard playing card games, some designed by Sid Sackson some by his friends. Theres abstract strategy, pencil and paper games and a new take on tic-tac-toe. It's great for people interested in board game/ card game design."
4,Great author. Fun and simple games.,This is a great book for those interested in 'creative time' with the kids while waiting for food to arrive at restaurants. Very well written.
5,Too bad this hasn;t been reprinted,"An amazing, fascinating book about games before the ""Avalon Hill"" revolution-way before the video game revolution. This book shows what a small group of nerdy, brilliant pioneers can come up with, working in their dark little basements. Too bad these games are essentially ""lost"" in the Guitar hero cacphony. You didn;t jump aorund when you were conquering the world, but it did make you think and imagine and interact with your friends and family."
2,Reliability not so great.,"On the surface of it, these monitors are great - good resolution, good size, well made for a wall or swivel arm mount - but the reliability is as bad as the first reviewer's comment suggested. I had two of these monitors purchased about four months apart, and the newer of the two had a CCFL bulb fail which made the whole upper half of the display dark. Also, the two displays never did show the same level of brightness even after serious time spent tweaking them. It's a hard decision to make, spending another $200 or so on one of these, or spending $5-600 on replacing both my displays in order to get something that's got more quality to it."
3,Hard to follow--amateurish,"The Adobe download which is supposed to serve as a script for the phrases being read contains a significant number of typos.The male voices pronouncing the phrases in English and Spanish are pretty much okay, except the male could slow down a bit. The female voice reading the phrases in Spanish lacks clarity and her voice tends to drop off at the end of phrases so word endings are indistinct. The female voice reading the English versions of the phrases is loud and clear with a distinct Southern accent. I have a Southern accent myself, but I'm not reading educational materials for the public."
5,Insight into the world of autism,"This is a wonderful and easy to read collection of poems written by a young woman diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. It includes elegant observations about her life: the people she meets, nature and wildlife, growing pains, depression and illness. Highly recommended for readers who interact with people with autism."
4,"Rockin' funk, oh yeahhhh!","Josie James and Lynn Davis were two of the hottest voices on the planet. The opener, ""Look What You Find"" still gives me a monster rush like it did back when I bought the vinyl in '80. That song alone is worth the price of admission, and the stellar musicianship and kickin' percussion really pull it all together. This has long been a favorite."
3,Has a few of the funkiest cuts from Duke,"How can you not love the explosive funky Latin hooks of ""Look What You Find?"" Such a crazy opening for one of the Duke's funkiest albums! This is followed by a tastefully funky pop ballad of ""Every Little Step I Take,"" a playful funk tune ""Game,"" and a more reserved R&B; dance song of ""I Want You For Myself."" These cuts are full of catchy funk hooks that you will keep listening for a quite a long time --- no wonder this is among the most commercially successful albums of Duke. The rest of the album is good stuff, but not quite as memorable as the first four.In short, Duke surrounds himself with such an immensely talented musicians that whatever he ends up producing (jazz, funk, R&B;, etc.) really shows their caliber. While this is not Duke's best R&B;/funk oriented album, it is worth a listen if you have not had the pleasure of getting down with it."
4,"Great Band, Great Album","I saw The Start open up for Incubus in Indianapolis recently and I was impressed. Never before had I heard a new band that hooked me in on the first song. I'd never heard them and I left a fan. This album is a true reflection of their performance. I played the CD 2 days after the show and was able to recognize all the songs they did right away. Tracks 2 and 5 are real jems. Ms.Echo's slightly raspy voice is perfect and needs no improvement. The ocassianal lead synthesizer played by the guitarist,along with the standard guitar/bass/drums set-up tops off their great sound. I was able to meet Aimee Echo and Jeff the bassist briefly after their show and they didn't pull any of the typical cocky rock-star attitude either(they seemed a bit tired though. can't blame them after such an outburst of energy). As for their sound.. hmmm.. Nirvana(they did a slammin'cover of breed) meets Garbage. And that still doesn't really say it all. Get this CD."
2,It is ok but .......,"But, when I heard ""The Start"" .... it sounded like new wave pop. Everytime I hear it I keep wondering if I am listening to ""No Doubt"". Now I am not saying this is a bad CD. There are a few really good songs. I would have to say the stand out tracks are ""Hang On Me"" and ""Gorgeous"". If you like bands like ""No Doubt"", ""P.J. Harvey"", ""Siouxsie & the Banshees"", or ""Garbage"", you would really like this CD."
5,a beautiful tale of horror,"Silence is the greatest work of Didier Comés. It has everything, passion , a great and pretty realistic plot some warscenes and two of the most hideous villains ever to appear in a graphic novel. If you're a fan of Forests&Tardis Ici Meme you'll love this book."
3,A bit small but ok,The shirt came packaged fine but it's sizing is a bit tight. Some manufacturer's just size differently and this is a bit small. Be sure to order a size larger than what you do from most other sellers.
2,Far too little jazz or Hancock,"Recorded in 1982 this album offers very little in the way of jazz such as you might find on other Herbie Hancock albums.In the main this is because this is a vehicle for the undoubted production skills of Rod Temperton, who at the time was ""hot"" as a producer.There are no less than four vocalists on the album, Temperton, Patrice Rushen, Wayne Anthony, and last, and often placed very far down in the mix and with a vocoder, Herbie Hancock himself.The same problems with mix can be cited for his keyboard work as well.It's notable that Temperton is credited as responsible for ""vocal and rhythm arrangements"". There are some good tunes on the album notably ""The bomb"" and ""Give it all your heart"" (which at 7.39 is the longest track).It has to be said that this an album for Hancock completists only"
4,Class in it's genre,"Two killer cuts on this 1982 release more than compensate for the weaker tracks. ""Getting To The Good Part"" is a true gem, the usage of horns and the instantly recognizable background vocals of Patti Austin gives it class. The bridge is superbly crafted too, making it the most memorable track.The final track ""Give It All Your Heart"" featuring Patrice Rushen has an insistent hook that will gnaw at you for days and features some fine Hancock solo work.Worth the money for these two tracks alone - the rest of the tracks are worthy pop/soul/disco numbers with ""The Bomb"" & ""Motor Mouth"" being the best of the bunch."
2,Appropriate title...,"The title of this album is right on target--was Herbie trying to tell us something? Producer Rod Templeton scored some memorable hits for the likes of Michael Jackson, but here there's little in the way of memorable tunes, the production is by-the-numbers even by the slack early-80's pop standards, and Hancock is little more than the stock keyboard player on a mismatched gig. I support Herbie's right to record anything he wants, including this disc. However, I don't think at this point in time that it will have much appeal to anybody, no matter what genre of popular music you prefer."
2,decent but cracked,"One long crack running top to bottom... sounds good though. Kids like it. I would have been, very upset if i had expected store quality, but for the price i expected three n got two stars worth of djembe"
5,STAYING POWER ! !,"This is a product that's been in my family for decades.My Dad's bought this for Mom for years,a kinda special gift that's shown up for different occasions over the years...Christmas,Valentines Day,Birthday....This year my Dad's now in a nursing home and Mom is at home,so Dad ask me to see if I could find it one more time for Mom for Christmas and Thanks to you guys I did.He was so proud to give it to her and see acted like a teenager when she received it...So Thanks for helping me fashion a wonderful moment in their lives one more time.Youth Dew still works it's magic for them even though their in their 80's.....Thanks Again"
1,Sadly not the same . .,I've worn this fragrance for many years and received so many compliments! I even had one man run after me (seriously!) in a store asking what I was wearing:) But now . . .I noticed changes a long time ago - the lotion that used to be so rich was now lightweight - both in texture and fragrance. Then the fragrance starting changing until today it is no longer the unique and wonderful fragrance it once was. They took a beautiful and classic fragrance and just ruined it. Another reviewer said it best - it now smells like bug spray.I quit buying two years ago. It's like losing part of myself - I was so identified with Youth Dew.
1,UNFORTUNATELY,"The scent of the item i received is far different from my many years Youth Dew !!I started wearing it 1n 1967 in Lisbon as a body oil, then i became an 'habituée', the problem is that i cant find them in Lisbon we don't sell it here unfortunately.As i have another bad experience with one i ordered from UK i cant be sure if the quality droped or if there are a bad quality to send abroad.?ana santos"
1,I Only Own This Because It's A Classic....,I believe Youth Dew by Estee Lauder was it's first scent introduced back in the 1950's.A must have for all perfume collectors such as myself...but I don't suggest wearing it...Way too strong and woodsy. Smells like bug spray.Alcohol content in this seems very very high.My suggestion buy it for the bottle...but keep the perfume in the bottle.
5,Reestablishing Pride in one's History & Herritage,"I am a white 1st grade school teacher. I thought this was an amazing story that went to the heart of black disenfranchisement in America. I also thought the book pointed the way back, to black pride and family history.This is a story about a child in school having to do a report on his ancestry, not actually knowing what that ancestry was or where it would lead him. The child discovers his roots in a rich history that provides roots for self pride and grounding.My first graders loved the story, and I am sure that older children would also."
3,They must use a different ruler.,"Plates are high quality, but do not believe the description - the plates are less than 6-inches in diameter, not 7.25 inches. 7.25-inches more closely matches the diameter of the salad plates."
5,Jesus Speaks in His Own Words,"Where can you find a book that Jesus Christ Speaks in His Own Magnificant Words? This book is it!!! Beautiful, Inspiring, Comforting and brings you Great Joy knowing He is There All of the Time. Jesus Christ is With You Along With God, The Beloved Mighty ""IAM Presence"", Acsended Masters, Hosts and Angels.

1,The I Am Discourses: By Beloved Master Jesus the Christ,Seller was unable to supply product but was very responsive in communicating to buyer and returning the funds. Everything was handled amicably and in good conscience. Thank you!
3,Not Effective,"I have been using this product for about a month now, applying as directed on the bottle. I have seen no change in my skin--the blackheads are still there, and I still have had troubles with minor acne--except for the fact that now my skin is really, really dry. Sure, it did feel a bit refreshing, nice and cool, when I applied (and astringents tend to have that effect upon application), but otherwise, no good points I can think of. If you want better results, I would suggest a different product--Oxy Balance Multi-Action Astringent has worked well for me."
3,WOW!!,"The bag says MEDIUM bar-b-que taste. Medium to who!? The souls in hell must be eating the hot variety! But the chip does have good ""crunch"" quality. Translate to these are hot chips that I keep eating and ""cussing"" at."
2,Not for clinicians,This is too basic a book for therapists. Don't let it's large size fool you. Ok for parents who need some guidance.
4,death at windsor castle,"wow! what fun. dont know why bought the book maby becouse of the cover (nice drawing)? who knows. the tech descriptions of the castle some time were a bit long (thought the auther was trying to prove how much he/she knew of the subject)other than that,again,fun. will read the rest"
5,Loved it,Janita has a great voice. I had this CD on repeat in my car. I'm a serious music guy and a song writer myself and I really enjoyed the production quality and lyrical content.
3,Not great,"This item is definitely a good deal for the price, and these stockings are sturdy, but the nylon is rough - not silky at all. It doesn't feel nice to wear, nor is it soft to the touch in the way that most gals prefer their hosiery. This item has a reinforced heel and toe, which is not included in the item description, so not for open-heeled or open-toed shoes. In addition. This item tends to run short, so order longer."
3,Ethical dilema of strangling animators....,"I was given this as a gift from a friend of mine for a birthday. First off I want to say that the idea behind this series is awesome! Its rare you find a good Fuedal Era Japan series but this definatly ranks up there with the best.I will get to the point quickly tho: why the 3 star review? Well like I said, the STORY is great but the animation is sorely lacking. Everything else about it (except maybe some of the english voice overs) are great, but for about 2/3 of the series you just want to walk away from the bad animation. Some people say that only the parts where they switched animators is where it falls apart, but I disagree. If you watch even the first episode you catch little nuances that are very very annoying.I am going to cut this short but be advised, I STRONGLY recomend a rental (if you can) before you buy this. Or better yet, get a friend to buy it and watch it that way ;)"
3,"Unbalanced, averages out","Watching this series made me think of the evolution of anime. You begin by watching akira style art of the 70's and 80's then watch as it changes from average animation, to absolutely horrifying, to good animation. I honestly can't remember the music because i was almost crying over how bad a few of the episodes' art and animation was. The storyline remained consistant, thank god. and the last three episodes were enjoyable."
1,This was painful to watch,"I had to get really drunk to finish watching this series. Animation is bad, and following this story was a pain. This is something else I bought from the suggestions of the rabid fans I decided to listen to.Buying an animated series based off the customer reviews is a waste of time and money. I'm sure if I look at Hello Kitty or Sailer Moon reviews on Amazon, there will be someone there that will give it 5 stars claiming that the artwork and the story line are absolutely beathtaking!Exploring anime is extremely difficult when almost every review is seriously skewed by some rabid fan!"
3,Not verry well put together,"When I watched the first disc I thought this was a really good series, but once I went on to the next disc I was outraged. The next disc starts out with what looks like a 1rst graders attempt at animation, I think the next episode had bad animation too. But after that it seemed like they went back to the original animators, I was a little mad but I figured the worst was over now. Well a couple episodes later the 1rst graders where back in the animation studio. Changing animators like this is the worst thing you can do, I could see if the animation started out horrible and they upgraded it but why make it worse. On top of all that the story was another one of those stupid make no sense Akira, Ghost in the Shell types. The ending was horrible, the only reason I give it 3 stars is some of the episodes where actually really good. I will bash any anime I dont like, I dont care if everyone else thinks its great or not."
3,"""Super"" isnt' the word for it.","Though the book claims to be a ""Super Adventure"" don't believe it, this book is just another ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" story. Volunteering to go through an experement where you are put to sleep for 1000 years you find that earth has been taken over by a tyrant. Fortunately, Venus and Mars are inhabitable and still reasonably free. Your mission is either to just survive or, if you're feeling adventurous to stop this tyrant once and for all! The one thing about this book that is different from all others that I've read is that there is only ONE ending that says you defeat the tyrant, there are a few ways to get there but they're almost the same."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!,"This is my number one favorite Betty Neels book (Cassandra by Chance being my second). This book is like a booster shot of heartwarming joy. There is little to none of the typical conflicts and obstacles found in most romance novels. The hero does NOT needlessly prolong the courtship, nor is he rude, sulky, surly, etc. The heroine is not too young for the hero, nor is she a doormat, damsel, or mouse. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Faith, outside the box.","Excellent book that can make a difference in the one ways views faith. If you can relate to Simon Peter, you will enjoy this book. God bless you as you move from your comfort zone.With Great Mercyauthor."
5,Confidence builder,"John Ortberg uses humor to greatly enhance our understanding. Who would have thought so much could be said about this Bible story? Fine for group study or alone. And the title is right:If there is something you are led to do but have fear, instead have faith and DO IT!"
1,book review (miniature size),"I did not realize that there was a full size version of the book and a mini-version when I ordered it. I think the Amazon notation should have been more clear that this was not the complete book that I was ordering. I ordered it and then paid to return it because it was not what I wanted.Miniature version of ""If you want to walk on water, you have to get out of the boat."""
4,Great Book,"Was a great book and easy to read. The material is not new ,but it was organized in a way that forced me to take stock of what it means to trust God"
1,disappointed,"I thought I was buying the real, normal-sized book. However, a small, 1 or 2-inch book arrived! I didn't see anywhere on the page where I bought the book that it wasn't the full-sized book."
1,book order,"I ordered these books and they come in as miniatures...completely insane! Who pays $5.00 a book for a 4""x4"" book you can not even read! I ordered these for our small group at church and now I will look like an idiot because we will not have in time for our meeting! Thanks, Amazon! I have better luck with the other vendors!"
3,Tiny,"I did not realize how tiny the book was, so when I got it I had to laugh.I really is minature.It give a good overview of each chapter.mj2teach"
2,Cute little item.,"Be careful about your purchase. The one we acquired was a miniture version. The type was ok and you could read it, but the book was about 2"" x 3"". It was a miniture and not at all what we thought we were acquiring. We wanted the whole book. When ordering we did not notice that it was a miniture edition."
2,"Miniature Version, Disappointed :-(","I was excited to get this deal on this book, it was hard cover, with shipping cost I thought this was a great deal. Laughter filled our house when we opened it up, this is a miniature book, not the full edition."
4,Walk on Water,"This book is excellent reading material. It's not heavy reading, but does initiate deep thinking. I found it very challenging for my walk as a follower of Jesus. It challenges you to put away the mentality that you need to know what God's doing before you agree to obey and follow. And it has a way of making walking by faith sound so exciting and daring that it helps to overcome the fears involved! :)"
5,Motivation 101,Excellent read! If you ever needed motivation to find and followyour purpose in life - this is the book to read!Your comfort zone will not be comfortable anymore. This bookwill catapult you out of it and you will not want to returnagain!
4,"If you want to walk on water, you have to get out of the boat",Our Christ Care group at church is going to have a study based on this book and so far it seems to be very good. I am sure that I'm going to get a lot out of this study.
5,Excellent Book,"I bought this book because I was drawn by the Topic. I read a few reviews before, just to see what others thought of it.I am overly impressed with the Author. The story of Peter walking on the water is not new to me, but John has taken this story, and has brought it into our everyday situation.We all desire to do great things in God, and would love to walk on water. However, we fail to leave the boat for many reasons.Fear of failure, lack of trusting God, or because we are afraid to leave our comfort zone. The Author has really challenged me to step out in faith. I hope this book will meet you at your point of need.Andrea"
3,Miniature Edition,"I did not realize the book was miniature edition, overall a nice spiritual book to give and use."
5,You Must Read This Book!,"The title of this book does not really describe what you will get out of it. Yes, you will learn how to take a step closer to trusting God and getting out of your security boat, but there are so many other thought-provoking sections you may wonder why you waited so long to read it! You can't afford not to read this book!"
5,Good book,"This book will challenge you to do the things you wanted to accomplish anyway. It makes you look inside to see things around you in a new way. It helps see ways that you can, and should, make a difference."
2,Inspiring words- minature book- extremly minature,"I guess I overlooked the word minature (my fault) at a glance it just looked like the regular size book and was very excited to find it at such a good price, and hardcover at that! PLEASE know if you order this you are not going to get the full version of the book. I am going to pay closer attention and get the whole thing next time. Felt a bit silly when I opened my package and the book was about 2 inches x 4 inches. For me I'm going to BAM and shop in person for this one!"
5,Awesome,Its a great book challenging us all to get out of the boat rather than wasting our lives not doing what God has called us to do
1,CAUTION!,Be cautious when ordering this book. I thought I was getting a full size book for a study we are doing and it is only 3 x 3 1/2 inches in size.
1,Not a Full edition,I couldn't believe it when the book arrived and it was NOT a full edition. It was a pocket sized book. I wish I'd read the comments before I purchased it because one comment entitled 'deceptive' expresses exactly how I felt--deceived.
1,scam artist,"you should be ashamed of yourself. I thought i was buying a book about christian beliefs . I got a book half the size of a cell phone. who would have thought to look at the size description . by the other complaints i have seen ,you are doing this maliciously. so the word this day April 20th at 617 pm ... bestows apon you karmaIf You Want To Walk On Water, You Have To Get Out of The Boat (Inspirio/Zondervan Miniature Editions)"
1,too small,"I should have read the description closer than i did...this is a ""miniature"" - i would love to find the book on amazon at a good price.."
2,"I may be walkin on water, but it isn't very deep","This book was... alright... I mean... It's got some pretty fundamental truths in it... but it doesn't go any further than that. I found it frustrating actually how it never progressed as deep as I hoped for. Now... something's to be said for simple pure truth, but in all honesty, I reaped more meditating on the title of the book than on the contents of the book itself.Not trying to be a discouragement to the author or anything... I just think that as far as spiritual milk goes, this book is straight from mother.I *highly* recommend Spiritual Devotions ed. Richard Foster, Spiritual Classics ed. Richard Foster, and My Utmost for His Highest by Oswald Chambers."
1,"If you Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to get Out of the Boat (miniature edition)","A nice, inspiring, easy-to-read but incomplete book, which contains a small portion of the original edition. The description should indicate, in addition to the dimensions of the book, that the full text is not included."
1,IF YOU WANT TO WALK ON WATER,This book was not what I thought it would be about so I'm not very happy with this book at all.
2,"OK,I guess","I purchased this book just in case I had to post an online resume. As it turned out, I was hired my a small company which hires the old fashioned way. . . through personal connections.Although more and more corporations are using the online format for recieving resumes and use software filtering systems to make the first cut, the fact remains that most jobs are created in businesses with twenty or fewer employees. And for these jobs, this book is not necessary."
2,"Great Swing Band-one of the best. But,","This stuff really swings. These are the original recordings. But, RCA has done such a crummy job trying to clean this material up, that it sounds like the band is down the hall, in a gymnasium."
3,The tired latest effort from the landmark chowhound duo,"Jane and Michael Stern are the original chowhounds...they blazed a trail for food writers by rhapsodizing over roadhouses and joints long before this kind of reporting was respectable, let alone sought after. Their writing is superb, but after decades of cross-country road work they've grown a bit lazy...more and more of their selections are obvious tourist places rather than real uncovered treasure (though there are still some good tips). Nonetheless, their stuff's worth reading for the writing alone...and though you'll be led to some clunkers, it's worth staying current on the authors who set the standard. This is their very latest."
5,Still the best guide for travellers who want authentic food,"There is no other guide like this one. If you like to try off-the-Interstate real food; if you like to explore small towns and meet the real people there; if you like a guidebook with a sense of humor along with a sense of good eats, buy it.We've tried other guidebooks while travelling the USA, and they all fail in various ways. This book contains helpful information to find that out-of-the-way gem and chow down. We've never been led wrong by Jane and Michael's books. The only disappointments have been when old family-run restaurants close down. Unfortunately, no paper-based guidebook can be exactly up to date. Call for opening times, since they are no longer printed in the book.If you travel in the US and have time to savor the true local culture, you will find it in the food. This is the best guide we've seen to that culture."
3,A MAN OF MANY TALENTS,"This CD offers some of Jim's greatest love songs. But, why purchase a CD that only limits Jim's talent. His best (CD's) to date is The 50th Anniversary Collection, The Definitive Collection. And if it is ever released on CD The Faces I've Been album would be the icing in any Croce collection. By the way for the record. Jim Croce did not die in a helicopter crash. It was a small plane. Info is from Jim's DVD Have You Heard Jim Croce Live."
5,Great buy,"As a DJ myself I decided to build my own cases for my equipment, I have a few Odyssey brand flight cases already which I love and decided to build my own this time around. After looking at others, I decided to buy this butterfly latch because of the great finish, when it arrived and I compared it to the butterfly latches on my Odyssey cases I came to the realization that these latches are just as good as the ones used by Odyssey.In my line of work, I build speaker boxes and flight cases a lot and I've been using the Penn-Elcom brand hardware for a while now. Everything I build looks really high-end and very professional when done. If you are thinking about buying this, do not hesitate as the build quality is great, and your finished product will look professionally made."
3,HELLO KITTY HAIR DRYER,gave them to my granddaughters for Easterthey use only HELLO KITTY hairdryers in college
3,Good BASIC Hairdryer,"I bought this for my 3 year old (we blowdry her hair after baths). After having used my dryer (a multi-speed, multi-warmth setting dryer) it was a little disappointing. This dryer only has one warmth setting accompanied with a LOW & HIGH setting. The first time we used it I had to direct the dryer a good 5"" above her head as she complained it was ""too hot"". Thus, is took a lot longer to dry her hair.As far as basic functionality, the dryer works as advertised and is VERY cute.Hope this helps."
5,worth the money,"Works fine, lots of power!!! I would definitely recommend!! Arrived very promptly and made a terrific gift for young girl"
3,Gave to Granddaughter,When my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke! Doing better using it now since we taught her not to hold so close to her head!
3,Average gauge for the average shop.,"If your doing just some basic engine building in your home garage, and need rough measurements to verify your work, this gauge is great, but the precision of the gauge is not great, it tends to be a little sticky. Quality is definitely good for the price however."
5,""" The Best 2 CD Set I Ever Got '","It's Got Rare Tracks Includes All The "" Outtakes "" And The Rca Album.Elvis Presley The King Of Gospel This Is Rare . The Outtakes Are Amazing..."
2,a disappointment,"I bought this book because I thought it would be about Aunt Zizi, a sweet elderly Italian immigrant...and it was...but only slightly. Mostly it was about the author, his politics, and what he likes and dislikes about America... He pontificates on the high cost of prescription drugs, what's wrong with the poultry industry, his belief that America spends too much money on the military...in other words the typical complaints of the baby-boomers and liberals today. Anyway, I stuck with it, and on the last two pages he gives some good advice...keep in touch with the elderly people that you know, as they will soon die, taking their memories with them...That's the reason I gave it two stars instead of none."
4,"Easy to read, like a nice conversation","I liked the book! I had heard the author interviewed on NPR and was so impressed and intrigued by the premise of the book that I decided to order it here.I appreciated the semi autobiographical way in which Celente presented the conversations he had with his aunt. And, not being Italian myself, I found the insights into Italian-American culture of the thirties throuh the present very interesting.Zizi is presented as neither omnisciently wiser than anyone else, nor as a caricature. Her life experiences are presented from the viewpoint of a typical person of her era, living, learning, and doing the best she can throughout her long life. I would recommend the book to anyone who is interested in sociological history, or just warm conversation with an older, wiser relative."
5,Zizi is one of a kind,"In this book, Gerald Celente pays tribute to his remarkable Aunt Zizi. In a series of conversations, the two make important points about our world today and the challenges of living in it. If you've wondered if the ""good old days"" really are better, read WHAT ZIZI GAVE HONEYBOY, and you'll not only be armed with information, but you'll be ready to do something about it. I buy up remaindered copies of the book and give them to my friends, who share my opinion of it once they've read it. It's a real ""find"" and a provocative and often very amusing read."
5,Good weaving of stats and real life,I enjoyed this book very much. The portrait of Zizi is lovely and the relationship between the writer and his aunt is very touching. Simultaneously the book provides a great breakdown on a statistical level of how American society has changed (deteriorated) in the last few decades.
1,publicidad engañosa,Dice que es compatible con ipods de 3g 4g y yo tengo los dos y ninguno calza resulta que es para un modelo especial de ipod de 3g y 4g que esta fuera de serie en el mercado deberían aclarar eso.
2,NOT FOR RECENT IPODS,"Thought it could work with a classic Ipod, but not. I'm looking who still have an older Ipod to try to sell it. Don't know how it works, I assume it must do the job, but really don't know."
1,Buyer beware,Wrong product because description was very deceiving. Good luck trying to return product. Cust service rep extremely rude. Folks read the fine print about returns with this company. They are not customer friendly and it will cost you and arm and a leg to return IF you qualify for a return. Very sad. Been doing business with Amazon for a very long time. This left me wondering how this company could still be in business.Belkin TuneStage Bluetooth-Enabled Transmitter for iPod and MP3 Players
4,Decent remote,"Sound quality is not 100% I feel, but the unit works well and does great in my bedroom setting. Best results come when the stereo volume is kept relatively low an the iPod is cranked nearly to maximum (best signal to noise)."
2,The Work Needs to be Redone,"This book is one of two rather unsatisfactory collections of Boone County Kentucky cemetery records. It is not complete, though the main corpus of major cemeteries is here. The index is quite unsatisfactory. There should be the name of the individual cemetery at the top of each page, as some of them are quite extensive and include 20 pages or so. To find out what cemetery that person is in you must turn back page by page to the beginning of that cemetery list, for if you miss a page you will certainly place that person in the wrong cemetery. The binding is nice, but the physical layout of the book leaves much to be desired.All in all this project should be scrapped and the entire work done afresh, and I have heard that some such project is anticipated."
5,Maybe the best HG movie since 4 Weddings and a Funeral.,Hugh Grant shines in this movie. Don't pass and watch it if you're over 30.
1,Shortest review I have ever written...,"About a Boy (Chris and Paul Weitz, 2002)The moral of this film is that single childfree males are worthless scum incapable of responsibility until they acquire women and children.Utterly nauseating. (zero stars)"
1,Bad,About A Boy is a bad movie. Its about this weird kid who follows a guy around because he wants his mom to like him. His mom is even more weird. She tried to comit suieside. I dont like about a boy at all. dont watch it.
1,Maybe.. if you liked Dumb and Dumberer,"If you're into dumb, go ahead and waste your time with this flick, but if you have a refined sense of humor, don't bother."
4,About a Boy,"If you are looking for fine script-writing, directing and acting, this is it. What you can find is a story that is so different from the ususal American standard plots, and it is refreshing. The performances are superb, too. Keep an eye on the boy's natural acting ability - he almost out-shines Grant who is also superb. If Hollywood movies are make-believe, this film stands out to reveal the facts of life."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"A really pleasant surprise. Not precisely a romantic comedy, the film mixes a genuine sweetness and humanity with just the right dose of unsentimental reality to prevent it from becoming formulaic or saccharine. The cast is uniformly strong: Hoult convinces as the sweet but not traditionally cute kid, and I have always liked Toni Collette. As for Grant... I generally prefer him whenever he's playing a bit of a cad, as he does here. (Grant has always seemed a bit liberated whenever he's not stuck as the `aw, shucks' romantic lead). By the end of the film, the characters haven't had sudden and conveniently scripted epiphanies as they might have in some lesser, more formulaic comedies, but they do seem to have evolved as human beings. Good stuff, and worth a watch."
3,Cute story,"I thought there would be a little more humor, but this is a happy little movie to watch when you are feeling down. I never read the book, so I cannot comment on that."
5,Heartwarming,I love this movie. The acting is superb and the story is well-written. You will really get into their lives and want to give some hugs.
3,Light comedy,"I found it contrived but pleasant. My wife thought it was great. There were funny moments and Hugh Grant is always funny even the writing isn't - his facial expressions, etc are funny by themselves. The kid character was wierd albeit deliberately so but inconsistent."
5,Emotional and touching... bits of humor,"What a splendid and enjoyable movie! Hugh Grant did not stray far from his bumbly self-absorbed character that he so often plays, but it was completely perfect in this movie.Will is a slacker who lives off of the royalties of a Christmas carol that his father wrote in 1958, he does not work, sits at home all day and watches game shows and ""Xena, Warrior Princess"". He devises a plan to meet women by going to SPAT meetings (Single Parents Alone Together) and pretending he has a 2 year old son. He does get a date, and seredipitously meets Marcus, an awkward teen whose mother is severely depressed, and has attempted suicide.Will and Marcus' exchanges are very touching, because you realize that they need each other. Will's irresponsible selfishness begins to melt away, and Marcus makes a friend.I loved the ""Killing Me Softly"" duet, it was great! Both actors were great in this movie--perfect team."
4,Hugh Grant makes this one better than it is,"Although this really isn't one of the genres I like to watch, About a Boy turned out to be a very uplifting and funny movie that was worth my time watching it. But it probably would've been just another average romantic comedy if it had not have been for Hugh Grant's presence.Grant has always been in these kind of movies and always does a good job with what he's given, regardless if it's actually a good movie or not. But, luckily, About a Boy is one of Grant's better films, more for the comedy than anything else.The only real flaw about the movie is that Hugh Grant's character is a little too annoying. Sure, I know that he's supposed to be a little unlikeable, but I think they went a little too far. Oh well, it doesn't hurt the film too much.BOTTOM LINE: Watch this movie if you like Hugh Grant or if you want to see a light-hearted comedy. Very, very funny. (4 stars out of 5)"
4,About a boy charms with wits,"What do you get when you pair up a worthless trust-fund scion with an ordinary boy of low self-esteem? A hilarious comedy that piercingly dissects family quirks, friendships and relationships. Hugh Grant exudes a cavalier charm as Will who finds himself gravitating to the young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) in their pretense as father-and-son to impress on his love-interest (Rachel Weisz). Marcus, in the process of avoiding his suicidial-prone mother (Toni Collette) finds Will a surrogate daddy-figure. Their affecting screen chemistry graces the excellent adaptation and direction by Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. Punctuated with provoking dialogues edged with sarcasm and rapier wits, About A Boy is an earnest comedy of dysfunctional families, dislocated society and humanity that is cuttingly poignant and sharply observant."
4,Well Done Charmer,"Hugh Grant certainly does make this an appealing version of the traditional Bourgeois commitment to the ideal of FAMILY AND CHILDREN as the only basis upon which a happy life can be achieved. Amusingly, 98% of the film is devoted to depicting all the reasons why that rationale is rotten to the core. Never Mind. Most of the film is very easy to take....on the screen. If one was not in the land of enchantment the production creates, it would be nightmarish. Credit an ably written script and production and, particularly, the role created for Grant, which he plays to the hilt. All-in-all, the average viewer is likely to be captured by Grant and his young friend, the 12 year old boy who adopts him, and, thereby, enjoy the film, and leave it feeling go"
5,Great!,Bought this as a gift for my mom for christmas. Arrived very soon after I purchased and in new condition. Very satisfied with price and product itself.
4,About Growing up,"So much for the cliche that our central character has to be 'likeable'. Hugh Grant's character (and would the movie get away with it were he not Hugh Grant?) is selfish, shallow and cynical. But also funny. Although he's a 'boy', he's balanced by the movie's second POV, a real but also troubled, eccentric, touching boy. Each learns from the other and the script is excellent in keeping those two POVs in perfect balance, including Voice Over Narration from both that is among the most skilful use of Voice Over ever. The climax departs from Nick Hornby's novel for understandable reasons - the original is too low key and too complicated - but in going after the usual Working Title movie big finish (private emotion in a public setting) opts for a huge contrivance in which a rush of emotion almost carries us past its unbelievability. Until the last ten minutes, however, this is just about perfect."
4,two boys for the price of one,"Right on the money. Doesn't miss a beat. Creative writing and great performances. The humour and occassional drama come in subtle waves. The boy in this story is definitely the character of Hugh Grant and to the story's credit a second boy,who is of age to be an authentic boy is introduced. He walks into Grant's life and turns everything upside down and they both learn to be men. Instead of going for broad comedy the script is more subtle, focusing on people's dilemmas, contradictions, hypocrisies and even finding humour in their tragic failures. It's really a drama that takes everything very seriously. But because it sees the light at the end of the tunnel, very clearly it teaches us that when life presents an end to something, it also offers a beginning to something else. Let's embrace it!"
4,A movie for those who use their entire brain,"The first few lines of this review will be dedicated to a fellow reviewer by the name of Joey. I have read a great deal of Joey's reviews and have a few things to say about them. They are short, badly written, have horrible grammer, and are of little use to interested customers. Even the things he likes he can't manage to express himself in more than 4 lines of split infinitives and incomplete sentances.Now that that is off my chest we can get to the good stuff. About A Boy is a wonderful flick and can only be appreciated by those who are willing to delve into its subplots. Hugh Grant brilliantly plays the shallow, self-absorbed playboy who befriends a socially gauche teenager at first to make himself look better in the eyes of a single mom, and later realizes that in Marcus he has found himself a friend. I really enjoyed this movie and the book is even better."
4,"jokes, seriousness and good actors","The film ""About a boy"" is the story of a superficial 36-year-old man named Will Freeman,who becomes a changed person because of a little boy named Marcus,is a excellent one with the right mixture of jokes,seriousness and good actors.The book by Nick Hornby,which was the script for the production,is filmed in a very good way.The main part of will Freeman is acted by Hugh Grand in an amusing way and other actors like Nicholas Hoult and Toni Collette,Marcus and his mother in the film,represent the characters,like they are described in the book!This fact compensates the onlooker for a from scene to scene often confused camerawork.The story of the film conzentrates on the decisive scenes of Nick Hornby`s pattern and differences in comparison to the book are allways justified choosen.All in all can be said,the film is a worth seeing realization of Nick Hornby`s work.But the film is not a patch on the book!by S.Rückmann"
5,"Fantastic, Hilarious Comedy","I like the plot of the story which you can see Will's changes gradually from a self-centred to a caring, loving guy. I like the way Hugh Grant protrayed Will, speaking with brutal tone. His boyish behaviour makes me laugh all the time, telling lies, chasing ambulance and ridding his life of all responsibilty. Above all, his sarcastic remarks,""the most killing is that both of them close their eyes.""Will is the real boy, instead of Marcus. On the contrary, Marcus seems to be more mature than Will. He knows how to care about his mum, though sometimes, he does in a wrong way."
4,About a Boy,"Only a breadthrow away waits the new begin for Marcus ( Nicholas Hoult ) and Will ( Hugh Grant ). A new relationship is developed in which they take profit of each other. Marcus, once introverted and very much influenced by his hippie-mother, learnts to adopt to society and to assert his wishes sometimes. In contrast, Will lives in the day and considers women as sexobjects, but changes his attitude towards relationships and women and recognizes that relationships substantiate on confidence and truth. The actors understand it well enough to represent the characters. The settings and costumes are also apt. However, I think the hippie-costumes are exaggerated. "" About a Boy "" is a soft entertainment film in which spectacular and heartrending scenes are missing. All in all ""About a Boy "" is a film in which the fingernails stay unharmed and the handkerchief dry."
1,Not worth the watch,Story line almost made up for how bad this show was. We wasted our time and money on watching this one.
1,Not about a book,"Umh.. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't a movie based on a book have oh I don't know a little something to do with the BOOK. About a boy (the book)was set in the 90's had a lot to do with Kurt Cobain and was funny. The movie was set in our time talked about gangsta rap and wasn't even remotely funny. What happened to Marcus? I don't recall him being as half as annoying in the book, and he was annoying. None of the other people got to devlope the way they'd did in the book. In fact this whole movie seemed to be about...nothing. And Will was just a moron. Hugh Grant as a bad boy in Bridget Jones. Charming. Hugh Grant as a bad boy in this movie. Well it was just sad. And the whole singing thing? Was that meant to be funny.I was like god why won't this end. I saw this movie for free and still felt ripped off. Making a movie about a book can't be that hard can it. The book serves as the base for your screenplay. I mean it's like taking an open-book quiz and STILL getting a F."
1,Boring,This would be the top movie i wasted my money on. I saw no point to the story other than the boy gaining a friend. I think it was a waste of money. I don't dislike many movies but I believe this has made the top of my list. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on this.
2,Time from my life I will never get back!,"If you enjoy watching a tormented little boy watch his weird mother suffer with depression, get made fun of at school and only have some adult guy as his friend, this movie is for you. If you want an up beat feel good kind of movie.. keep searching. It was just sad and very very very very very long."
1,About Nothing,"I finished watching this movie about 20 mins ago, how I got through it I'll never know.Imagine Having a really simple plotted romantic comedy with thin but easy to understand plot, then imagine having not one but TWO patronizing voice-overs accompanying the picture, narrating it - both of witch go to point out what any one with a brain cell or two should have figured out long ago.Hugh grant is likeable enough (as usual) but the boy (i forget his name) is so irritating, you start to emphasize with the kids that bully him for being strange.But above all this films worst crime is plane and simple Unfunnyness! There was perhaps two points where I laughed, which is not good for a film which bills its self as a comedy and is made by the directors of comedy hits like American Pie.So over all I'd say give this one a miss and rent something else, it doesn't really matter what - its bound to be better than this movie."
5,"Touching, insightful, funny and enjoyable","Very enjoyable film. A well done comedy as well as an entertaining commentary about modern life. Another very good adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel (see also ""Fever Pitch"" and ""High Fidelity""). Hugh Grant is brilliant as Will, and it is a refreshing change from many of his previous movie roles. I prefer watching him play the handsome cad rather than the bumbling nice guy (v.boring)."
3,"Touching, but lacking","About a boy is a nice, and touching movie. There is some great comedy too. I am a huge Grant fan so it's would almost be impossible for me not to like something he's in. He's so endearing.However, I guess I am not a Collette fan because I almost never like anything she's in. I don't really get her comedy, and find her odd and misaplaced in most films. Her character her makes me somewhat uncomfortable for some reason. Mostly, the movie just moves rather slow.It's still a feel-good film and I am glad I saw it. Just wouldn't buy it."
2,This Does NOT Do the Book Justice,"If you've read the book, I wouldn't bother to buy this. You'll be left feeling robbed.This film simplifies the storyline and the characters to the point where the heart and bones of the whole thing is ripped to shreds.You might be mildly entertained if you haven't already read the book, but really, if you haven't read the book yet this might very well put you right off it, and that would be a shame, because Nick Hornby is a great writer.I'll put this review in context by adding that I felt completely the opposite about High Fidelity, another film made from a Nick Hornby novel, which was truly marvellous and inspiring."
3,Kind of Corny,"I love Hugh Grant, and was extremely disappointed with this movie. I didn't find it nearly as good as it was said to be."
5,VERY ENTERTAINING...,"This movie is surprisingly very funny ,entertaining and too cute almost. Hugh Grant is always the perfect role for these romantic comedies. This movie reflects on the social aspect of an adolescent boy who is an outcast and a grown up man (who is actually still an immature ""boy"")who has everything but does not know his path in life. Together they found and helped each other find happiness. This film is a must for DVD collector's."
4,"full of cliches, but still good!","I think the movie is very good and touching that most people would enjoy. At the same time, it fulled of cliches. Great material (it is based on Nick Hornby book), good work of directors and acting compensate and make the difference. I thought I wouldn't be able to stand one more Hugh Grant appearance that is so familiar from many other his movies. But somehow this movie makes me forget about other similar acting gigs by Grant. The movie leaves yoou with a very nice a warm feelings and what else can you ask from romantic comedy - hard to believe that the same directors (Paul & Chris Weitz) did 'American Pie'."
5,Awesome job!!,"I love this movie. I first saw it on a cable station and just got pulled into it. Might be because of Hugh Grant...*SIGH* anyways! It is very comical in several aspects of the story line and sad as well.I don't want to spoil but just a bit of an overview, a guy that has nothing to do b/c he's so rich invents a kid to meet women, and then meets a kid that has a mom that's a loon. The kid thinks, ""RIGHT ON! He can help me with my mum!"" The truth comes out about the made up kid and then Hugh Grant's character makes up to be the father of the kid with the looney mum to impress another woman. That doesn't work out very well but in the end everybody is really happy! WAHOO!!There are lots of spots that are funny because it's where the truth has to be told and they just don't know how to tell it without repercusions. Love those parts!"
5,A Valuable Resource,"This book is great to have if you feel you need to improve the dialogue in your fiction. It is written with a conversational style throughout. Chiarella points out that real-time dialogue is not the same as fictional dialogue. By listening to other people talk (as well as myself), I find that he is quite correct. He teaches you how to push your story forward with dialogue, when to make your character talk (or shut up), and gives good examples of 'tennis court talking' or dialogue that goes nowhere. This book is a very good resource for my shelf."
1,Actually 1 star is too high of a rating,"this book is lousy its the worst. It promises alot but doesn't deliver.If you want to learn to write meaningless every day conversation like:""Hi how are you Sam?""""I'm fine thanks George.""Then this book is for you. It never gets past the above formatt of dialogue and the narrative of this book is boring and hard to understand. The writer is a bafoon who admittedly carries a journal around recording conversations like the above ""Hi sam..."" The book is so annoying it make me want to scream."
3,Useful but not outstanding,"There were some good tips in this book, but overall there weren't as many as I would have expected from a book focusing solely on dialogue. A number of the tips I'd already read in more general books on writing, so that tempered the amount of useful information I was able to get out of the book. The commentary and anecdotal stories in this book make it more interesting to read, but also leave less room for the actual mechanics of writing dialogue."
3,needed more on mechanics,"I'm a published author all ready but I got this book to help improve my writing and dialogue. I found the book easy reading and basically useful. I only wish it had more of the nuts and bolts of punctuation and formatting- that is where I fall a bit short. Otherwise, a decent read that may be helpful."
5,Dialogue Devotion,"So Bruce, how'd you like the book?What book?The one on dialogue?Oh, that one. Yeah, pretty good. Why, you ask?D'you learn anything from it?Yeah, lot's.Care to elaborate?No.Oh, come on!Alright, I learned that ambiguity is good.Really?You callin me a liar?No...no, I was just saying--I'll tell you another thing--No, that's alright. I'll just--No, you asked and I'm gonna tell ya.Alright, what is it?Conflict.Conflict?Yeah, conflict is good. Oh, and keep your sentences short.Short. Okay, anything else?Yeah, but you'll have to buy the book to find out.Alright, I'll do that. Thanks.You're welcome. Now get out of my face."
3,needs more information,what I wanted to know was how to write dialogue from an interior aswell as exterior point of view including personality styles.
3,For the inexperienced,"My sense of this book is that it was written for, perhaps, a junior college course in writing. It's a good introduction, but definitely not for the experienced or more intuitive writer."
2,Ready For a Spanking From the Headmaster?,"Chiarella looks so far down his nose you'd think he was Pinocchio. Some good ideas buried pretty deeply in the bloated monologue. I learned very little I didn't already learn from more general books on writing that had a single chapter on dialogue.The man curses some very four letter words and brags about how he did it as a kid. He says to listen to others for book ideas. He hasn't a clue about modern block-busters we want to write. I have about twenty books on writing, and no good one on dialog yet.The author is indeed high in his ivory tower looking down on his ignorant students. He is a teacher, not an author. He has written a book of short stories (no reprints is my guess) and several short stories for various magazines. Come on, this is the lowest rung of professional writers.Boo for Chiarella and Boo to Story Press."

2,a let down,"i love these movies, but me personally i was thrown off by this one. this movie is that it let me down. the movie was good just didn't fit into the children of the corn movies, but you watch it for urself. the movie is good just very different from the other."
2,SHUCK THIS CORN,"Okay, enough is enough. Stephen King's tidy little short story has gone through 7 additional alterations and it's time to put this franchise to rest.COTC GENESIS is the latest entry and probably the most boring one. There's hardly any children in this fiasco and no real resemblance to the original storyline. The inclusion of an apparently psychic lad makes no sense nor is there any logical reason Billy Drago has amassed the seldom seen youths. Drago somnambulates through his role while Kelan Coleman and Tim Rock look completely lost. Director Joel Soisson has no sense of pacing or suspense and GENESIS is ultimately dull and uneventful. Let's leave the children in the corn where they belong!"
2,Mostly pointless,"Okay, what was this all about? Preacher came from Gatlin, but which one was he when he was a kid? He is still alive. Now he has a mail order bride and a kid that he keeps in a shed. There is also a church but we never see any service in it, and a bunch of people seem to come out of nowhere at the end, and what is up with the pregnant lady? Too many things are left loose here to satisfy me."
2,Horror,"This movie was not good .The first is allways the best ,Now its 8 movies of children of the corn .It speak for it selfs.."
5,I Love it.,I would recommend this to everyone. It is a great addition to my collection. I love the Children of the Corn movies.
2,Children of the Corn: Genesis,"Tim and Allie are taken in by a crazed preacher and his wife after their car breaks down in the desert, but the dark forces at work on this remote farm refuse to let them leave! The eighth film in the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series is a bit of a mystery, especially considering the complete lack of both children and corn. GENESIS could have been filmed under any other name and remained just as ineffective. Billy Drago is creepy enough in his own right as Preacher, but he can never take the place of the murderous Gatlin children that are only alluded to in the plot. The opening act sets up an intriguing rebirth for the series that only becomes increasingly more convoluted and confused as the film goes on, until things finally fall apart in the end. Like HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS, CHILDREN OF THE CORN: GENESIS is a failed attempt to revitalize the series, and it ranks amongst the worst of the many sequels.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,Marketing and Science: A Match Made in Heaven,"Michele Miller is not only a master at what she does, but she's also one of the only marketing to women gurus out there telling us the ""Why"" behind the ""How."" This information should be a key brick in the foundation of every single marketing to women strategy. I include Michele's amazing information in every marketing to women talk I give, and it continually blows marketers away! Great job Michele!"
2,Don't really see the point,"Michelle Miller is a marketing guru when it comes to marketing to women. However, I don't think that this CD is the best example of her expertise. She goes through and indepth description of the differences between the male and female brains and how we process information. That's fine, but I would have prefered for her input on marketing to women-her area of expertise."
2,5 minutes -- that's it.,"Don't buy this pack if you think Clooney has a major part in Thin Red Line. He's only in the film for 5 minutes. That's it. The movie is great--don't get me wrong. But this is not a ""DEAL"" if you're thinking Clooney Trilogy."
3,For Serious Clooney Fans Only,"""Thin Red Line"" appeared to have less than 3 minutes of George Clooney in it...great movie, but very disappointing if you wanted to see a Clooney performance. However for the very brief minutes Clooney was in the movie, he made it count! ""One Fine Day""...the two stars both looked beautiful. ""Solaris"" was interesting and thought provoking."
3,Five is Fair,"There are eight stories in this book that a five year old might be interested in. (Reading level is probably appropriate for some older 5 year olds.) It's convenient to have the collection and might be perfect for a book of stories to stash in a backpack for waits at the doctor, etc. The stories are ""from"" some children's books you might recognize. I'm not certain if they're excerpts or condensed versions. They seem rather disjointed, although there is a brief introduction at the beginning of each story, which helps make the connection. The stories include some illustrations from the books, some are in color. The stories are nice, but I think my young 5 year old would have preferred going through each book separately."
5,TAMILEE CONTINUES TO BE THE BEST!,"Tamilee has one of the best personalities in the fitness world! My favorite section is the classic buns and thighs exercises. Thank you Tamilee for bringing those moves back! Love her leg warmers! Weights, a step and a stability ball are used for the other chapters."
4,"Ronnie Aldrich Piano Music, Easy Listening","When one becomes older, he is likely to listen to more and more easy listening music, such as I have. I now listen to Romantic Easy Listening type music rather, than the ""pop"" type music I used to listen to. I love watching and listening to PBC when they have the Doo Wap, and the hits of the late 50's, and 60's....but for my everyday listening music I now prefer the music of James Last, Ronnie Aldrich, and instrumental type music of the old hits..My grand kids think my music is old fashioned, and out of date, which it is, but wait 'till they get my age and have been there and done that. I think this album is worth buying and listening to. This is coming from an old fuddy duddy, 67.....I can recommend it to anyone that likes relaxing and living a slower pace.....:) Kenny"
4,The definitive book on using NLP in business,"Hurrah! An NLP book by someone English, and it's good. Very clear and well-structured overview of NLP as it applies to business. Sue is great on the importance of integrity and congruence in organisations, and on how to use sensory-rich language in corporate communications. I've found this book useful in my work in brand positioning. Docked one star for the metaphors (guess what - wizards, wise old men and dolphins) which many readers are going to find annoying. Just skip them, guys! Otherwise excellent."
5,HIGLY RECOMMENDED,"This is a fine collection, but what really makes this product worthwhile is the DVD with all of the Housemartins' videos. I had known the band's music for years, but I have never seen any of their videos 'til I bought this package. My notion of the band completely changed, I thought they were serious lads beacuse of the lyrics' social comments. But the videos are so much fun, hilarious... Perhaps the funniest videos ever, and that really balances with the socially conscient lyrics. Tipically english. Brilliant, brilliant."
3,DVD sound is bad,"I've got no reason to buy this, as I've got all their albums. I got this just for the DVD. And to my dismay, while I really enjoyed the visuals, the sound of the first 4 videos are really bad. Couldn't they just remaster the sound before relase ?"
5,Superb Item,"My bears did not come with a bag. Other than the lack of a bag, these are the same counting bears we have in our home. These are great.My son has learned to group things by color using these, count with these, and now add and subtract with these counting bears. There are additional worksheets that are laminated that you can buy to help your child work through various math problems using these bears. I have also recently bought an elementary scale with buckets to weigh the bears. He can compare the weight of bears to other items with it.These bears are a great start for math manipulatives. With the purchase of a few other math items, these bears can easily be encorporated into math all the way up to 3rd grade. My two year old daughter enjoys playing with the bears as well. She lines them up and pretends they are going to the store together.well worth the money.Enjoy."
3,Somewhat interesting,"As others have reviewed, this is obviously the author's first job in an industrial setting and some observations are quite naive. It is also not a Toyota plant as one might assume from the title, but a little further down the supply chain. This, in itself is a unique viewpoint, as little has been written about Toyota's 1st or 2nd Tier suppliers or their captive companies. If you have many years of engineering or manufacturing experience under your belt, you might consider that many of his negative observations are not unique to Japan - just lack of exposure on his part.An interesting read to see the social side of Japanese industry, but little insight into the inner working of TPS."
4,An interesting memior of a first job,"As other reviewers have mentioned, parts of this reflect experiences the author would have at any first job.Japan is definitely different (from the US anyhow) especially in the way women are treated, and consensus is created (and desired).Sure parts are a bit naive and parts are unreflective, but that's what makes it interesting."
1,Author has NO manufacturing experience,"This is proof that we live in an age where anything can get published. This book takes place at HINO MOTORS LTD. - a small 60yr old facility on the outside of Tokyo, not a new efficient toyota plant as one might assume from the book title. The author goes on to critique manufacturing techniques and stratagies at this diesel truck producer. Unfortunately, he leaves out many of the most important factors that make lean manufacturing so important on the Japanese factory floor. I find it very odd that someone with no manufacturing experience would be able to critique and draw conclusions on vehicle manufacturing in Japan. However, the book does have it's strengths - if your interested in strategies for dating Japanese women, or stories of drinking sake with co-workers, then this may be the book for you."
3,Relatively expensive and not of the best,Rare and relatively expensive The Very Best Of Joe Cocker [BR Holland] of 1999 is 73 min. long and it does not seem to be a selection of the best. Its good substitute would be a compilation made of the first 10 tracks of The Best of Joe Cocker of 1993 and 8 tracks (the first 10 tracks except No. 3 and 9) of The Best of Joe Cocker: The Millennium Collection of 2000. They both cost next to nothing. Any CD burning program allows to do it within minutes.
5,"Oh, Brian","If you understand the title, then you know what I mean.Really appreciate the way the various directors portray the genre. 5 Stars. Great stuff."
4,CANNIBAL BLOOD GIRL...,"Although this film is lowbudget, and you can tell, it's still alot of fun. Every single short within the anthology is completely different! My two favorites were CANNIBAL BLOOD GIRL and SPEAK EASY. Cannibal blood girl and speak easy were the only films that had been made by directors with previous experience. Creep Creepersin and James Cullen Bressack. I loved seeing Sophie Dee but naked covered in blood in Cannibal Blood Girl. Speak easy was just a low budget gore pleasure that was quite artistic and fulfilled a fantasy of mine to see gore with dubstep. Pretty sweet! If you like lowbudget anthologies, you are gonna like this one so check it out!"
3,Completely different!,"Ok let me start off by saying I am a big fan of Sophie Dee so it was pretty great seeing her sexy body in a horror movie. You see her whole body naked and bloody. It's pretty great. Other then that the shorts are a bit low budget for my taste. They are a lot of fun though. I really had fun with the host stuff. Andy the Arsonist is pretty hysterical. I think there is some fun to be had with this film and if you enjoy low budget indie stuff I think you will like it more then I did. It's not bad, it's just not on par with your run of the mill horror film released by a big studio. ITS NO CREEPSHOW It's more gritty and grainy if you know what i mean? It's worth the buy just for sophie Dee though."
3,"dry, yet informative","The book, ""minutemen and their world"" was originally a little difficult to get into.There wasn't much of a hook to get the readers attention, but yet once one was able to get into it, it would hold your attention.If one is interested in learning more about the revolution in concord, this book is a definite must.Eventually I enjoyed this novel to an extent.I definetly did learn numerous things about the revolution that i had no previous knowledge about. I appreciate my teacher for requring us to read this piece of literature."
2,Not what i was looking for,"This book was very, very informative. However, it was also very dry. This book was assigned to me, for summer reading, and as a book, it fails. As a collection of facts, it is very well done. If i had been writing a paper, or doing a project on the Minutemen, this would definately be one of my sources. But, like I said, just to read, this book is not my first choice. I read it, and took notes, and i still have trouble remembering most of the knowledge contained within ""Minutemen and their World."""
1,rip off,"this is not my first used record,by the way. i forget how much i paid for this, but in reality it is a giveaway at a yard sale. if i'd seen it first i wouldn't have paid a quarter for it. if this person thinks this record was in good condition in any form, they need to be run out of business. the seller of this record is the perfect argument FOR walmart."
2,Volume pathetically low,"I had to rip the tracks to my HDD, then raise the volume and burn it back to a CDR. Poor quality for a commercial CD!"
3,New songs,I was disappointed in this version because there are at least 5 songs on it that are not on the version I purchased years ago. I don't want these songs. I want the album that I know but don't know how to get. There is no indication on the cover information that these new songs are there.
3,Flashback,"Hair has a cocky smartness that still holds up after all these years; look deep enough and you'll find a musical with actual structure and substance.But what a chore cringing through the 60s drug-soaked lyrics and ado about nothing. The tinny, brittle recording quality also grates on the ear...maybe in keeping with the material.I survived the late 60s by being in the safest possible place: the US Army. Ironically, a lot of the trust-funded, drug-fueled, Save-the-Planet Boomer Brigade did not, surviving to middle age on dividend checks and, ultimately, apathy.Still, Hair's worth it on nostalgia value alone."
2,My humble opinion,"I see a lot of five-star ratings for this musical, and I just don't see this musical as being at that level. I was a teenager when the show first came out. Maybe it's me, but I never saw the quality of musicianship or intellectual depth in this musical that others seem to feel that it possesses. I would classify it as pop music that sounded good in its time, combined with social themes that had everybody in a terrific uproar in the '60's.There is a lot of other music from that era which I feel has an enduring appeal. Not so with Hair. Sorry to be the negative voice, but perhaps it will be useful to shoppers to know that the high regard for this musical is not unanimous."
5,Great Soundtrack,"While I will admit that I don't think that Hair will stand up as long as the Soundtrack to 'Rent' will, I do think that this is an amazing and brilliant collections of songs of a specific time that has little if no meaning for somebody like me who was born in the 1970s."
4,Not quite complete?,"Although this was as great as I remember it when I was a student, I only seem to have 30 tracks on my CD and not 32 as someone else mentioned. Where is the complete version of Flesh failures and let the sunshine in? Mine sure doesn't have it. Apart from that, did it bring back some memories!"
2,"Get the movie soundtrack, it's way better","I came to this backwards in time; I saw the movie version first and listened to that soundtrack. Go and buy that one, not this one; that one is way better. The musicality is outstanding on that one, whereas this has a second-rate AM radio sound. I was a pre-teen when the play of Hair came out and I remember most of the songs from AM radio in the late 60s--but after listening to the soundtrack I realize why most of the hits from Hair were recorded by other people. ""Aquarius"" was popularized by the Fifth Dimension. ""Hair"" was popularized by the the Cowsills. ""Easy to Be Hard"" was popularized by Three Dog Night. All those versions are better than the soundtrack (and some are not very good). Listen to Cheryl Barnes sing ""Easy to Be Hard"" in the film: it is outstanding."
5,Wonderful! A must have...,"... if you're a 'child of the sixties', or even if you're not and appreciate well written, well produced musicals! We (wife and I) love the off-broadway version, too. Interestingly, I noticed a friend was a guitarist in the Broadway band! (Steve Gillette - check his albums out, too - singer/songwriter) what a treat! Highly recommend. Listen to either disk from beginning to end for best enjoyment."
3,Brought back good memories.....,of the past. Back in 1968 I bought the original London cast recording and they did a great job while the US cast did a good job with these song. If you can ever find the London cast record at a tag sale or flea market grab it.
4,Hair - The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical (1968 Original Broadway Cast),"This is my prefered version of the soundtrack. Also got the ""Original soundtrack recording"" but this is the version I remember."
4,60's Greats!,Really enjoyed listening to fine tracks from the 60's. Anyone who lived through the sixties as a teenager will love this one.
3,"Beautiful music, appalling sound quality","I love this musical, and decided that the best way to enjoy it on CD was to get the original cast recording. Unfortunately, there was either something wrong with this CD, or the original master recordings were of really bad quality. I got a lot of heavy distortion and buzz from my speakers when playing this CD, something that does not happen with anything else I've played before or since. I also don't remember that much distortion on the old vinyl copy I listened to when I was a child.Even if you're not an audiophile, the level of distortion on this CD will be hard to take. Perhaps the anniversary edition (ASIN B00000JYU8) has been cleaned up? I'd recommend buying that one over this one, in any case."
4,Hair The musical,"It is a little different than the album I purchased in the 70's, but it was worth thr purchase."
5,Hair CD,"Was very impressed with this outstanding product, it was well packaged and was delivered quickly! My Sister loved this gift and am sure she will continue to do so in the years to come. Will do business with this company again."
5,Gorgeous!,"Haven't installed this lamp as yet, don't have to in order to be pleased with it. Its online description is everything that I expected it to be; simply lovely!"
5,It's excellent and it's cheap!,"I had scaley, horrible shins. This stuff fixed them inside of two days and they stayed nice. Penetrates beautifully but is not at all greasy. Leaves a subtle, dewey sparkle that gives a glow without looking glittery. I am not a huge fan of the scent as I find it strongly vanilla-ish but I got used to it. They make an unscented version I prefer."
5,Rare Beasts is the BEST!,"I really liked the book. My opinion is it is a 5 star rated. I just really like the mischievous personalities of Edgar and Ellen. The plot was very clever, and well written. It was also very lively. There really just isn't much more to tell. I just really liked the story!"
5,Those Krazy Kids!,"What a treat! This book is clever, fast-paced, and marvelously illustrated. I love the world that Ogden has created. It's great for kids and adults... Bring it on, Charlie. We want more!!"
1,Psycho-demented,"As both a teacher and a parent, I found this book extremely morbid, demented, and just plain nonsense to spend time reading. To read in graphic detail about the torture and torment of both animals and children was very disturbing. Throw this book into the hands of a child that already has psychological problems and they're bound to have more! I in no way encourage children to read this book OR parents to buy the book for their children."
1,Animal Abuse,Nice way to teach kids to mistreat animals.Way to go Chuck. Don't we have enough problemswith these kids being brats?
4,A breath of fresh air,"Rare Beasts brings a new energy to the children's section of bookstores everywhere. In a refreshing departure from the norm,the protagonists - Edgar and Ellen - are two mean kids who DON'T reform at the book's end. They don't see the error of their ways; they don't end their adventure subdued, regretful, and itching to assimilate with the rest of their community. These two little outsiders remain smart, contrary, and full of wicked plots. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book.Rick Carton's illustrations capture the witty spirit of Rare Beasts perfectly. This book gives young readers credit for being more grown-up than perhaps some adults might think, and kept me (at age 23) turning the pages as quickly as I could."
5,weight watchers complete food companion,"very happy with book! this book has everything and very easy to follow. i have fallen off my points system, but i'm back on it."
3,"Book is OK, but photos are outdated","There are several good layout ideas in the book, but most of the photos appear to be from the 80's or, maybe 90's. Still has some good ideas though."
5,I cannot wait for another one!,Kenton was one of my major favorites and this real tight Band does an excellent job of meeting what the arrangements wanted you to do! Anyone who gets it will really enjoy it! The quality of the recording is absolutely fantastic! They really know how to put the music together to really enjoy it!Jim Paxton
3,average.,"Although the title is named"" 100 most asked q's"", the actual questions are rather picked to increase readability. For sure there are some good questions that we can relate to, but most of them are either too wierd or too rare. ( e.g. one questions was about this guy turned on by going to dentist but nothing else. see what I mean?) I just found it difficult to finish reading the book. but i think it's still worth the cost. Beacuse after all, I bought it only for the cover guy(the author). (isn't he cute??)"
3,"An interesting book, but missing something......","It's not a bad book - however, it is really more of a compilation of questions from readers - these questions may not fit what you are curious about - and some of them definitely are not very representative. The one good attribute - who is that really cute guy on the cover - is he the author?"
1,Forgettable Fluff,"This book is just silly, and instantly forgettable. It contains nothing but common-sense suggestions that anyone with half a brain already knows. I received it as part of my course materials that I had paid for in advance. I had no idea this textbook would be so lame, and sold it for 10 dollars. I see it retails for over 100 dollars, yet I was glad to get rid of it. It reminds me of one of those large children's puzzle books, that tries to keep you interested with lots of colours, diagrams, & illustrations. I expect my textbooks to be more adult oriented."
5,Just plain old fun!,This CD is just full of fun songs anyone can enjoy! This CD would be especially fun at sleepovers! It's a blast to sing along with some of your best friends!
4,Not as good as the broadway soundtrack,"This has most of the songs from the Broadway Soundtrack, but not all. Some of performances on this CD are not up to the Broadway version, either. Dick Gautier WAS Birdie, and Chita Rivera will always be Rosie. I bought this version BEFORE I realized that the Broadway version was available...now I will have to purchase that one, also! If you have a choice, purchase the Original Broadway Cast version."
3,We Love You Conrad!,"This is a really great soundtrack, but there are couple tracks missing from the original stage version. Spanish Rose isn't on either Birdie soundtracks...but it's still a really fun soundtrack if you ever did the musical and want to get all nostalgic! Yay UC FOLLIES!"
5,totally fun cd- im 13 and LOVED it!,"after seeing my brother's school putting on this play and hearing him rehearse, i learned all the songs. Then it was on tv and new i should buy the soundtrack- i did and now i can't stop singing it! Good Job Andrew! class of 99!!!"
1,Vulgarized Version of a Great Musical,"""Bye Bye Birdie"" is one of the most thoroughly entertaining and well-crafted of Broadway musical comedies, but you wouldn't know it from George Sidney's monstrously stupid film version, which drained all the satire and wit from the show and replaced it with idiotic gags, annoying camera tricks, and constant vulgarity. This CD reflects the problems of the movie it comes from, with unimaginative arrangements and poor sound quality to boot. Janet Leigh and Ann-Margret are as miscast on disc as they were in the film; Dick Van Dyke and Paul Lynde are heard to better effect in the original Broadway cast recording. Skip this CD and go right for Columbia's superb Broadway cast album, which is infinitely better performed and offers better sound as well."
2,Bye Bye Birdie without the charm!,"This C.D. is probably one of the worst C.D.'s I have ever heard! It lacks most of the original charm that the other two C.D.'s have. Though Dick Van Dyke and Ann Margaret are fabulous, the rest of the cast stink. So does the movie. Janet Leigh was fabulous in Pyscho, but was terrible in this - musicals aren't her thing! If you want to get Bye Bye Birdie, stay away from this one."
3,Dated,"Some interesting toppings, but little information on dough development or history. The recipes are simple, and offer good results. No attention is paid to sourcing ingredients, or authenticity, but then again, it was written decades ago."
2,A little disappointed,"I assumed when I ordered this book that it was the same one I had seen at the local ""William Sonoma"" store. They were out of the book and had no idea when it would be in. I ordered it without checking and found it was a different book. However, it was not worth paying the shipping to return it."
1,Tracking Problems,"The music is great, but the CD will not forward and stop at the individual songs. I have to listen to it from start to finish, and if there is a song I don't like, I just have to listen to it. I wish the recording to CD was a better quality. Not a good recording."
2,Not The Same Guy...,"It's hard to believe this is the same guy who played the opening guitar riffs on one of the greatest rock songs of all-time, The Faces ""Stay With Me"". There is nothing on this record that comes close to the energy of that song or any other of Ronnie's best work (""I've Got My Own Album To Do"" or ""Gimme Some Neck""). The album label boasts guest artists Bob Dylan and Scottie Moore (Elvis), but all we get is one track that's an short, informal acoustic jam with no vocals from Dylan,(Considering Ronnie sounds alot like Dylan, I was looking forward to a rockin's duet from the two). The album is mostly acoustic. Other than some sub-par raspy vocals from Woody, you'd never know this was a Ron Wood album. I quess there is a chance this album can grow on you if you enjoy acoustic, demo quality songs; but if you really want to see what Wood is (was) all about pick up ""I've Got My Own Album To Do"", ""Gimme Some Neck"" or ""The Best Of Faces""."
3,"not his best, or worst, just ok","this is a half good cd, meaning only half the songsare good, the ones that sound like ronnie wood , notronnie wood trying to sound like the eagles, the songswith edge are great but dont brother with the rest,is this worth getting , if you want to add it to yourronnie wood area, but you wont miss it tho,"
5,Ach Ja! Another Great Turbonegro Album,"I was pretty disappointed when I first heard ""Scandinavian Leather"" but after a few plays have grown into the great new release.The tempos are a little slower but the melodies, lyrics and performances are still top-notch:""Sell Your Body"" will stay in your head for weeks because it's so catchy. ""Fix your hair and sell your body to the night"".""Remain Untamed"" has some of their most intense guitar work to date, the axes howling like the hounds of Hell.""Le Saboteur"" is just as offensive as their other past tunes in light of all the trendy Gallic-bashing these days.And ""Ride With Us"" is awesome, recalling the Dead Boys at their peak (""We're on a mission to destroy!"" yells ubermensch Hank von Helvete).It's strange that the band has only performed one song from the new release in their live act because many of these tunes stand up to their previous classics. And Happy Tom is still a scary guy to look at."
3,A dissapointment....,"I love Turbonegro. And it's pains me to say, this album isn't very good. When you compare it to their other albums such as Ass Cobra, and Apocalypse Dudes, you can see how it falls short. Don't get me wrong, it does have a few good tracks. I simply love the opening song, ''The Blizzard Of Flames.'' But aside from that, I really would not reccomend this album.If you still want to buy this album, get Ass Cobra and Apocalypse dudes first. The live album Darkness Forever is good too."
4,Not a Gay Metal Ghetto,"Norway's Turbonegro take the homoerotic underpinnings of heavy metal, flaunt them up front, and turn the volume up to 11. On Scandanavian Leather, they reign in their punkier tendencies for a more streamlined approach - Judas Priest, for example, if Rob Halford had come out and stayed with the band. (FYI - a reunion is in the offing.) But their metal dreams aren't limited to the gay rock ghetto. ""Wipe It `til It Bleeds"" is a hard sex anthem regardless of sexual orientation. ""Gimme Some"" is about money. ""Sell Your Body (to the Night)"" a hustler's lament. ""F**k the World (F.T.W.)"", well, you can figure it out. They even have their own public service announcement: ""Turbonegro Must Be Destroyed"". Their biggest supporters (so far) are Queens of the Stone Age and Dave Grohl. Not bad recommendations at all."
2,major disappointment,"Turbonegro is still the best punk rock band going today, and Ass Cobra was THE punk album of the 90's. Needless to say, when I heard they had reformed, I was very excited to hear what they would do next. Unfortunately, Scandanavian Leather just falls flat. Its funny, as all TN's albums are, but what always set them apart was that they rocked, and I mean ROCKED. This album sounds more like satire, a parody of a band like Poison. Again. its funny, but if I want musical parody i'll pick up some Weird Al. Aside from two standout songs that would have fit in nicely on Apocalypse Dudes (Drenched in Blood and Turbonegro Must be Destroyed), this lackluster album does very little for me. I have high hopes for these boys, that their next album will get back on track, but for now i'll just have to keep Ass Cobra and Apocalypse Dudes in regular rotation."
5,TURBOJUGENDUSA!!!,"I use Turbonegro as a judge of character. It's simple- Those who like them = good/ those who don't = bad. Buy this album, or I'm coming over to your house.The Denim Seaman"
5,Brilliant and Exciting!,"I first have to say, this book is one of only few books that I can read, listen to music at the same time and still understand the meaning of the book. I do agree with Dawn about Tim's genuineness in writing this book but disagree about his humor. Tim is not THAT funny, but that is not important. This book is for everyONE, of all ages. Whether you're not a worship leader, wanting to be a worship leader, or a current worship leader, this book is right for you. Just because you are musically talented or gifted and singing worship doesn't mean you are doing the right thing. And even if you cannot sing or play an instrument does not mean God cannot use you in His glory. In this book, Tim teaches us to worship God with the Holy Spirit as our worship leader. Hughes even go as far as what we should look for in a band, how to choose a song list and much more. To make my point clear and simple, read the book. You'll be glad you did."
