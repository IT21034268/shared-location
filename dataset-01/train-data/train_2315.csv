4,Good but still has a lot of vibration,I researched different trainers for several months before deciding on this unit. Noise was going to be a major consideration since I live in an older apartment building on the second floor. I ruled out magnetic and straight resistance trainers becuase of the amount of noise they seemed to make. Once I settled on the liquid resistance trainers this model immediately stood out to me.The good:Barely any assembly requiredStores nearly flatGreat resistance curveQuiet if you have smooth tiresVery solid build qualityThe Bad:The quick release lever is nearly impossible to release once the bike is screwed in tightly. It does eventually release if you unscrew the clamp far enough but seems to defeat the purpose.The vibrations are massive even with it on a pad. It sounds like a constant rumble in the downstairs apartment.I am quite happy with it overall though and it seems like it will last a long time.
4,Roller mount needs better engineering,"Great trainer, the resistance is good, the product is solid and the mechanics of the roller and resistance unit are superb. I have a lot of confidence in those parts holding up. The plastic mount plate for the resistance and roller unit is not well designed. The bolt and sleeve that hold it on (allows the resistance unit to be rotated up and down) is sloppy. That may be insignificant when it is tightened up against the tire, but it's one of those ""feels cheap"" things that you would think they would take care of after building everything else so well. Also, they offer a replacement tightening bolt for ""when"" it strips. Nice of them to admit that this part will eventually crap out, but again, how dumb to make such an insignificant part on the cheap when the other main components are top-of-the-line. All told, it's reliable and smooth enough that all you have to worry about is your work out, not the equipment."
5,Very Satisfied,"This is my first trainer and I was willing to pay a little more for quality. The lifetime warranty and no-leak guarantee seemed to be unique to this brand. I've ridden the trainer 3 times now and I can say that it has excellent initial quality. (That's all I can speak for since it's so new) It has a great, road-like feel and it is very quiet. It is very stable and also, since its power curve is so accurate, you can use the Kinetic power computer to estimate power when using the trainer. (Since actual power meters are really expensive)Kinetic Power Computer N/A 13 FunctionThe parts are all well crafted, solid, machined parts. I highly recommend this trainer!"
5,works as promised!,"bought this as a 'refurbished' item. would never have known that if i hadn't been told. arrived packaged as new with all the accessories. full warranty in place. GREAT price! and we really USE it! excellent piece for winter workouts. we use a dirt bike instead of a road bike, so is noiser than advertised, but is still FAR less noisy than an indoor trainer we borrowed from a friend using a road-style bike. Husband didn't believe it could be until he heard it himself. Would definitely buy from this company again."
5,Great indoor exercise!,"This is a great indoor bicycle trainer. I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! It is good quality construction. It takes up just a little space when not in use. This is his first bicycle trainer, so we have nothing to compare this to, but rate this 5 Star. The price was $319, the quality is there. The Super Saver Shipping sure helps."
5,great build quality smooth operation,super smooth operation inside a solid build quality. Unit was easy to set up and get into the action quickly.
2,A trainer is a trainer is a trainer,"I expected more from the descriptions and reviews. Basically it is just another trainer. I found it does not imitate the feel of riding on the road. A low gear is ok, but larger gears and you run into the same old problem of increasing resistance that does not mimic the feel of the road. On a side note, I was very disappointed wit hthe wireless computer. Turns out it is not truely wireless as you have the cadence wire. display is small for an indoor trainer. All in all I would recomend on of the more advanced trainers with the PC interaction etc."
3,Shipping problem,"I have only used the trainer enough to determine that it works but not enough to rate it. I will rate it when I have used it longer.It arrived in a shipping box that had been badly torn and hastily re-taped. The trainer was encased in a plastic bag which had a disturbing amount of loose dirt inside. I removed the trainer, brushed the dirt away with a soft cloth and assembled it according to the enclosed instructions. I then had to pour the dirt from the plastic bag into a trash can.I can only hope that the trainer continues to work as advertised."
4,Noisier than expected,"Good: easy to assemble and operate. Okay: variable resistance - for hill and interval training, the silicone takes a little while to heat up for real increased resistance. Bad: I didn't expect it to be so loud (this is my first trainer). To hear music/tv, I have to turn up my stereo by 10-15 Watts. I think the noise is continual squeeking coming from the tire contacting with the cylinder (maybe it should be matte for more friction at a lower contact pressure like a real road surface)?"
4,Kurt Kinetic Worth the money,"This is the first trainer I have bought, but ater reading others reviews of some less expensive trainers, I can see why this got rave reviews. Instructions are clear, but it was really quite simple to figure out. took 10 minutes to set up and put bike on it. Only takes a minute to switch out bikes and adjustable tension lets you feel like you are riding. We use the trainer 2-4 days a week dependant on weather and switch my bike and my wifes out every day. This is built solid, and we have had no issues with machine performance."
3,Not that quiet,"I traded my Cycle-Ops Mag trainer for this one because of the strong reviews and promise that it would be much quieter than the Mag. Unfortunately, it is not that quiet. Particularly at higher wattage, the trainer becomes loud, vibrates, and seems as though it is not designed for such speeds. If watching TV, you will need to crank up the volume from a normal 20 or so to 70+.All in all, I am having a hard time justifying the $170 price increase over the mag trainer. A family member has a Blackburn trainer, which is much quieter, less expensive and is not bright green."
5,Great product,Does the job well. Use when the weather is bad but you still want to get in a ride work out. Easily unclips for when the weather gets better and you want to go outside for a real ride. I am getting a lot of use out of it this winter.
2,Overpriced,"Got this saturday, a bunch of cd's no written material to go with itVery big waste of money"
3,"Very good for high beginners and on, but expensive","I was quite pleased with this software, but I agree that it is not that helpful for true beginners. It has a wide variety of learning activities and contains a surprising amount of material. It is much, much better than the overpriced and overhyped Rosetta Stone series, though this is still not cheap. However, be aware it is for Castilian Spanish, that is, as it is spoken in Spain, not Latin America; the accent is rather different and some vocabulary differs, too.Of course, learning a language with software is probably not the best way to do it. I think for the same investment of time I have learned a great deal more with audio CDs and workbooks - I, at least, do truly need the workbook as well as the CD to cement the learning. The one advantage of Tell Me More Spanish is that it has a lot of workbook-type exercises built in.[...]"
5,TeLL Me More,"Tell Me More is a great product for language learning. It teaches the way you learned your language, speaking then doing the grammar. It teaches you by looking at things, doing workbook exercises for those workaholics out there, and you actually SPEAK the language. You can't expect to be able to speak the language fluently without, well, SPEAKING IT!!!!! T.M.M covers the speaking and listening part of the language really well. I know that some people are like ""This is horrible for beginners... bla bla bla"". This used to be a problem but know they have a program with a COMPLETE BEGINERS level. There's your promblem solved. Although I used Tell Me More Italian, I guarentee this software will work the same way. It's so worth it!"
1,I almost ruined my camera.,Do not buy this. The threads do not match up with my Canon HV20. I almost ruined my camera.
1,HORRIBLE,"ok do not buy this. the thread is all screwed up and when u screw it into the camera it will make it cross threaded and then strips the thing on ur camera. i ruined my HV30 because of it. DO NOT BUY and get something for more money, its worth it"
1,A Bad Book,"This is a bad book. The two authors, who between them have about 1/100th of Sontag's intelligence, integrity, and imagination, written in the most pedestrian prose possible, set about to undo her reputation.Each time they credit her with something, within the next sentence or two they somehow take it back, or cast doubt on it. Only her battles with cancer are described with anything like sympathy.Apparently it is beyond them that a woman, and a beautiful woman at that, could produce some of the most important essays of our time. That she has changed her position on some issues is treated as some sort of betrayal, hypocracy, or attempts to jump on a particular bandwagon. Perhaps, like the intelligent woman she is, she re-thought some of her earlier positions.Why they wrote this book is beyond me."
2,Trash with flash,"The flash is the brilliant Sontag herself--her quicksilver mind, her style; and the trash is this book and the modus operandi of these authors."
3,Readable and enjoyable,The book is good but could have included more scriptural analysis and application to what the authors accomplished. More first hand accounts from the Jewish perspective would have been helpful too.
3,It seems to work.,I wish I could give this a higher rating. I use this dryer in my 33 foot motorhome to help combat moisture build up when it is stored. It works but not to the point where I feel the inside of the RV is safe from mold. I use some Dry-Aire bags as a backup.It is bigger than I imagined and just does okay as a solution to humidity problems.
3,I should have just bit the bullet and bought a dehumidier,"I bought this because of all the good reviews it received and recommendations for using it in an RV, but I wouldn't do it again. I had a slow leak in my 23' Class C RV cab over section. I bought this because of the price and that I heard you should buy a dehumidifier in addition to fixing the leak in order to suck up the moisture that penetrated the exterior. It's no dehumidifier, but it does heat up the environment slightly I noticed. .. Which is not what I needed during the summer!I should have just bought a dehumidifier like I ended up doing... I went with the Eva-Dry, which as I understand isn't a true dehumidifier either.. but it's cheap, does visibly remove water into a reservoir and it's about a foot tall which is good for an RV. I should have just got one of those in teh first place.Oh! I will say that I did notice a difference in the smell in the RV.. using this did make an odor problem go away."
5,Husband loves it,"This was purchased for my husband, who loves hot sauce. He is happy with it. Received from vendor very quickly and it was packaged well."
1,Prazi SealPro,I was eager to use this product as I had a large painting project that would span multiple days.Out of the box the unit would not provide an airtight seal. The product was worthless.
4,Good Intro,"This book covers a broad topic, and is therefore not extremely thorough. It still gives a good bit of useful text for its small size. Generally speaking the plates are good, but they have nothing on Angus McBride. The book covers the following topics, usually devoting one or several pages to each:The Armies of Outremer (Christian territory centered on Jerusalem)The Military Orders (like the Templars and Hospitallers, and some lesser known groups)The Iberian Armies (El Cid and the Reconquista covers this topic in much greater detail)Byzantine Armies (extremely brief)Abbasid Armies (Armies of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad)Moorish Armies (the Armies of Islamic Spain)Seljuk Armies (Turkish warriors during the Crusades)Fatimid Armies (Egyptian Muslim forces)Ayyubid Armies (those of Salah al-Din and the Battle of Hattin)Mamluk Armies (Turkish slave mercenaries at the end of the Crusading period)Plate Commentary"
5,armies of the crusades,this is a great book it shows all of the gear that the crusaders used. 5/5. I recieved the book 2 days early it felt like a surprise.
3,Too many armies,Like a lot of Osprey fans I primarily use their books as research material for miniature war gaming. Osprey books are wonderfully concise things. There are a lot of different factions though in the Crusades and I felt like there wasn't enough room to cover all the different armies it attempted to cover.
4,Armies of the Crusades,"A great resource for world or European history. Good background in the text, but very good to excellent illustrations. A very good teaching tool."
3,A goodish book on Jackie - original photographs.,"I am a Jackie-phile, so when an extract of this book appeared in one of the local women's magazines, I rushed out and ordered it. If you have read C. David Heymann's ""A woman named Jackie"", there will not be much or any new information in this book, but the leeser-seen photographs of Jackie and Jack make this book worthwhile."
3,Just OK,"This book is just ok, mainly because there was alot of false information in hear that is trying to be pushed off as truth especially when it came JFK womanizing as well as some of the sources since it is a known fact that certain people have never open there mouths up about JFK especially to journalist. But there was also some truth in there which can be proven from other books ans sources as well, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. If you are looking for just a glimpse to the love story of jack and jackie kennedy then this would be an ok book but if your looking at that love story in depth then this book is not the one to read. I would not recommend this book to anyone I know let alone anyone that is a serious Kennedy fan/follower."
4,A touching story.,This book tells the touching story of the relationship between Jack and Jackie Kennedy. It is well-written and is a sympathetic telling of their relationship. I enjoyed it very much - better than most of the books about the Kennedys on the market.
5,I felt the love of the couple as well as the hurt.,"This book made me feel as if I was there, observing their marriage. I especially felt the hurt of Jacqueline when JFK would stray."
3,A Casual Read about Jack and Jackie,"This is an very readable book about the marriage of one of the most famous US President's and his glamorous wife. The book opens with a short story about Jackie and details her early life very throughly. The book continues on telling how Jack and Jackie met, courted, and their marriage, ending with the death of President Kennedy. The book tells about the birth of the Kennedy's second son, Patrick who only lived a few days, how the Cuban missle crisis helped to define JFK, and JFK's hidden illness. The book is written in very easily understood prose which makes the book pleasurable reading. On that note, I do not think this book would be considered a piece of scholarly work. This is a good book for those looking for an easy read about the John and Jackie Kennedy."
3,Takahashi/Jansen Review,"When I saw that this CD was actually in stock, I jumped on it right away. Having seen the ""Stay Close"" video recently made me want the cd even more. However, upon my first listen, I was disappointed because though there are several tracks listed on the cd case, there are only actually 3 tracks on this cd. So, unless you are a diehard Takahashi/Jansen fan, you might want to save the import price on this one. It is nice to have in your collection, though."
5,Great product...good service,Product important to keep house moist during the winter season. The filter helps do that. Product is great and service is great. Thanks!
1,Wick filter for Model H12 (1045),This filter looks like the original filter but it doesn't perform like a true original equipment filter. I could only get 26% humidity out of it. I finally gave up and replaced it with an original filter which provides at least 36 - 40%.
2,Microsoft Zune 30gb Mp3,"I got really a good deal when I bought this item. However, I became very unhappy with it as soon as I opened a box.Number one issue I noticed first was the weight. Product was pretty heavy. This was a gift for my wife and she totally wasn't happy with it.Number tow issue was functionality. This item was very NOT user-friendly. I could continue on and on, but I totally didn't like it and sold it. Finally bought my wife an ipod, which she loved a lot."
5,Changed my life.,"I read about this book on a Billy Graham article. I highly recommend it and have given away many copies to others. I have been very self-conscious for many years and this book brought me to the realization of who I am in Christ. For years I had memorized many if not all of the verses recommended by this book, but I didn't have the key to believe what God said was true. No one is perfect and as a Christian I have always been too hard on myself, this book released me from the condemnation from myself."
4,The Search for Significance - Tapes,"The abridged version of the book is good, but the sound quality of the tapes leaves a little to be desired. This would be much better if they re-released it on Audio CD.Doug"
4,The Search for Significance,"I came to a place in my life where I needed to find my significance in God, versus in man...As not knowing how to find my worth in God I found this book very helpful in my quest. Any words of wisdom based on scripture that helps one grow as a Christian is well worth the journey!"
2,Skip it,"I don't believe this book is going to help anyone see their true worth through God's eyes. I don't belive it will make you feel or think any differently than if someone you trusted on the matter said to you: ""God truly loves and cares about you. You are unique. You are special - because you are His and because our Lord Jesus Christ suffered so that there would be no taint against you. God knows the real you and loves you as you are."" .... Now, did that make you feel any better?"
1,bad,"I still didn't get the book that i ordered 2 weeks ago, i really need this book as soon as possible can you take a look at it"
5,Life changing book,This was a life changing book for me after spending a lifetime of performance in hopes of finding acceptance by people and God. These things I was taught as a child by well meaning parents and teachers in a parochial school. Mr. McGee makes it very clear that Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ and not a religion of trying to earn favor. I recommend this book to everyone.
5,The Search For Significance,"I had read it and it turned out to be insightful and helpful of myself as well what seen of others to help me understand deeper level what God's been trying work out of me and I don't know if others notice themselves but it's beneficial to all who are tired of the lies, wish walk in new man, and are needing understand as to the 'why me' questions usually have. May all be blessed by this as I have been."
5,For Those Who Struggle With Workplace Pain/Issues,"If your whole identity is wrapped up in your work, and your self esteem can be be ripped away in a flash depending on what others think of you, give this book a try. Even if you don't agree with all of it, the central message is healing and redeeming. Anytime I find I am being tossed about on the choppy, merciless waves of the opinions of people, I find comfort in the message of this book. Because I took its message to heart, I have been more successful in life than I could have ever imagined. People comment on how amazingly stress-free I seem in spite of a demanding job, and I can attribute this all to this book. I know now, in a deep and lasting way, where my true value is, and how the deep and multifaceted impact of Jesus'work on the Cross is where my importance is."
5,the search for significance,I read this book over a decade ago and purchased it for a friend. He is thrilled to have received it and challenged by its content.
2,General knowledge about flying,"This book provides general knowledge and information about flying, but is not really designed for someone who is AFRAID of flying. It discusses booking tickets, booking special meals, bringing carry-on luggage, yet only briefly covers things which makes flyers nervous in the air. The title is therefore misleading. Good general information about air travel, but not for a fearful flyer."
4,Great primer,"This book gives good facts for enduring fear. I used it with another, The Backseat Flyer, which had some natural remedies that really worked. The two together did the job."
5,Superb!,A great addition to one also buying the Complete Jewish Bible. Learn how the hebraic meanings of words truly differ from the the english translations we've became accustomed to.
5,Don't miss this great read,"Whether a beginner or and old warhorse to the faith, what a blessing it is to find a read like this. Try it, you can always come back to it, and I read that as one of the messages this book gives."
1,Segregating and Judaizing Christianity,"That is the essential agenda that this book supports and promotes. Segregating Christianity into Jewish believers and Christian believers is a dangerous venture and one that would break Christianity into the Messianic Jewish Chosen elite and ordinary Christians. Stan Telchin has very accurately warned about this and people would be well advised his book, A Loving Call to Unity.Lately there is a trend to subvert authentic Christianity by reverting to Jewish practices and this self-hatred and Judaizing is a sad thing indeed and true Christians should beware of it."
1,BEWARE DON'T RELY ON THIS PRODUCT!,"I am not sure how others found this product helpful. It is no more effective than water.I have Old English Sheepdog males who fight. I keep them separated at all times. Occasionally someone accidently leaves the gate open and the fight begins.This product doesn't deter, it does NOTHING! I too used several cans with no response at all.If anyone knows of a product that does work, please let me know.Please don't rely on this one!!!I wouldn't give any stars if it were possible."
2,Didn't work for my situation,"I have two female dogs that get into fights with each other and bought this product on the recommendation of a professional dog trainer. I saw her use it effectively to prevent confrontations between them, but once the fighting started this product proved to be completely ineffective in distracting the dogs so I could separate them. I sprayed it directly in their faces with no effect.Pros-The product can is designed well with functionality in mind. It has a locking trigger to prevent you from accidentally spraying it. It also has a built in belt clip.The loud hissing noise it makes when sprayed is a good way to distract dogs that are ""locking in"" on each other.Cons-Won't work on an animal that is in an enraged state of mind.Larger and more aggressive breeds will ignore the spray or be further aggravated by it."
5,I WON'T GO TO THE DOG PARK WITHOUT IT,"I have a French Bulldog, and he is a sweetie, but at times he gets bossy with other dogs. If the other dog doesn't want to be bossed, it can quickly escalate into a fight, and my dog doesn't back down. That's the reason I bought my first can of Direct Stop. It worked like a charm!Now all I have to do is show the can to Spike and he starts behaving himself in most instances. However, there are still times when dogs don't get along in our park, and a few are pretty aggressive when they're around a dog they don't like. The spray has worked every time, and it sure beats trying to physically break up a fight and possibly getting bitten! Word is spreading in our dog park, and more and more people will be using it."
2,Will it work?,"What they do not tell you before you buy this product are the directions on the bottle.""To Use: shake can for 1-2 seconds...""""Note: shake can once per day prior to potential use.""So you are supposed to shake the can before spraying and shake it daily. What happens if you do not? I shake it every time I take it with me on a walk but I do not walk every single day, unfortunately.I would imagine that in this day and age a delivery device could be created that did not require shaking.I have not used the product yet, so cannot comment on its efficacy. Hopefully if a dog is charging my dogs and me I will remember to shake it first, and that it will work since I do not shake it once a day."
3,Animal Control Spray,"My wife takes walks in the summer for exercise. She takes this along just in case, and feels all the better for having it. Good price, easy to use and carry."
1,a tornado swept through town,"Useless, if you have both arms broken like I did when a tornado swept through town. The Animal Deterrent Spray just sat next to me in the dark as I could do nothing with broken arms. I tried to shake it with my toes but it takes years of practice unless you were born with lobster feet."
5,I used this and it worked great!,"I used to stop a Great Dane from attacking my handicapped Dachshund. Boy did it work. The dane stopped in his tracks turned and ran. The best part was that, unlike pepper spray, nobody got hurt. I do not walk my dogs with out it. I shake mine when I put it in my pocket, no big deal."
4,But not on Bears,"I've had to use this product several times while at my local dog park. My dog is also like the other reviewers terririzer - her head spins and turns into Satan if another female dog comes near her. The spray has settled a couple of little fights but didn't stop one particularly bad fight. I used the entire can but it didn't deter either dog. So mild aggression will be detered but a determined dog won't be detered...and as the label says, it doesn't work on bears either. I still highly recommend the product and keep a can in my car at all times."
3,Have a back up plan along with this....,"As a person who interracts with aggressive dogs on a daily basis and has had many occasions to try this product, I've found the title to be a bit misleading. While this will temporarily annoy/disorient some aggressive dogs, if a dog is really determined enough this will not ""stop"" him. Please heed the ""fine print"" warning on the label before counting on this for your safety. I'll give this three stars as this will temporarily distract your low-medium aggressive dogs thus allowing you a chance to escape. I simply cannot give this 4-5 because it is not effective against a high-violent aggressive dog. It's better than nothing but PLEASE always have a back up plan...."
2,Won't stop agressive dogs,"Just a warning,,as someone else stated this will not stop an agressive attack nor will it stop a pitbull. I have a greyhound that was attacked by a pitbull and I actually had to jump on the pitbull and wrestle it off as the direct stop was no more effective then spraying the pit with Chanel number 5. Once we were ""attacked"" but some little yappy mutt type dog and it did make the dog hesitate for a few moments which was long enough for us to get away ( generally greyhounds won't fight) but if you are looking for something to stop a real all out attack, this won't do it. I am pretty sure the directions even state it will stop mild to moderately agressive attacks ( it also says it won't work on bears,,,well duh) so you know what you are getting. I carry pepper spray rather then this product,,however one more thing. Pepper spray can blow back on the user, if Direct Stop does you'll never know it."
2,Didn't help,"I bought this product after my dog trainer recommended it to help separate my two dogs when they fight. Well, it didn't even phase them. Perhaps it's more helpful in stopping a single off-leash dog coming at you."
3,"it worked, but didn't last","I got about 5 shots out of it. It worked fairly well, but does not last at all. I'm looking for something that will last me longer than that."
1,down the drain,"I don't remember what inspired me to buy this book, but GOD is it boring. The author thinks he is the only one to understand Nostadamus, and proves it by droning on for page after page of mindless drivlle."
1,"Pompous, full of false promises","Unfortunately, the book does not deliver what it promises. The author indicates a new method of interpreting the quatrains, i.e. the Green Language. As with most writers about Nostradamus, however, he spends a great deal of time with a posteriori predictions (""postdictions""). If he has truly found a new way of accurately interpreting the quatrains, then why is he not able to provide predictions? The author makes a lame argument that Nostradamus, himself, specifically wrote in a manner to make predictions impossible. Additionally, the author writes in the first person plural, which I found incredibly pompous and annoying. Save your money."
1,Funny (in both ways),"A book for the Schadenfreude crowd. How an author makes a complete fool of himself.He very aptly and concretely shows up in certain quatrains, where other interpreters cheated; and then goes on, cheating himself autrageously. Or he just leaves out half of the text of a quatrain to show his theories fit.He shows us, how little is known about Nostradamus (correctly), only to use the sentence ""in Nostradamus very own way"" or ""as Nostradamus saw it"" or similar turns of phrase, whenever he gets stuck with his system of interpretation.On the whole, he is almost as inventive as Rowling, but misses all the charm of Harry Potter. So - stick with Harry Potter, it's much more fun and tells you maore about live."
4,UK! Undastand What's About To Go Down...Again!,"That's what I expected to here emminated out the speakers of my car when I popped in the second, and I hoped even phatter, installment of Westwood. But no! I waited patiently all through the entire album waiting for my man Timdog to say...something! No! Even so, the man holding down for the UK and the rest of the world did drop some pretty heavy beats on this latest installment. He did get a little liberal with the distribution of the bomb droppings, though. Which is why I can't wholeheartedly give him the full five stars this great DJ deserves. I can only hope that the next installment, Westwood 3, will showcase what a great orator...and DJ he is.Radio One! Holla!"
3,Beautiful Eye Catching Piece.,"I love this bracelet. For the price you are getting a quality piece. I fell in love with it from the picture and the actual product did not disappoint. Although I do have a small wrist so for me, this bracelet is a bit big. Just be prepared. But it is stunning!"
4,Jewish pregnancy companion,When I was pregnant with my daughter I searched for resources for Jewish women facing fertility issues or pregnancy and was thrilled to find Dr. Frymer-Kensky's book. I have admired her scholarship and breath of knowledge for many years and loved this ability to have it in a form that helped me celebrate my process of being pregnant and of delivering. Rabbi Amy Bernstein
5,Basilisk Review,"Basilisk combines a ""Romeo & Juliet""-type love story with Naruto-style ninja action, and throws in some of the most violent death scenes ever seen in a Japanese anime. If you're into any or all of the above, you can't miss out on Basilisk."
5,Tripp Lite ISOBAR8ULTRA,This is my 2nd unit and I have been using the 1st for 12 years or more. Well built does the job. Never had a surge or spike related failure with the computer equipment plugged into the strip.
4,Nice item.,"I like these. They are substantially more expensive compared to other surge strips, but these are built like a tank and leave the impression they won't cause your house to go up in flames if something goes wrong. The case is metal, they are heavy, and appear to use quality components. I have most of my computers and home entertainment devices plugged into these, and have never had a problem."
4,Tripp Lite Isobar review,"I have been using the unit for about a month and it has meet or exceeded my expectations.It is well built and it performs well too. I have not had any electrical surges or spikes so I can't attest to how well it will perform under those conditions. The only negative I have so far is the supply cord is too long, but I'm sure it's not a problem for most people."
3,Not a noise solution for me...good power strip,"Shipping and packaging excellent. Did not clear noise/hash coming through the mains. To be fair, noise can be very challengingto get rid of, given all of its sources.As a power strip with its surge protection it is potentially a 5 star product. Tripp Lite has an excellent reputation."
5,tripp lite surge protector,The Tripp Lite ISOBAR8ULTRA 8-Outlet Isobar Premium Surge Protectoris the best built surge protector I have ever seen or owned. I woulddefinitely buy another one.Tripp Lite ISOBAR8ULTRA 8-Outlet Isobar Premium Surge Protector (2350 Joules)
5,Surge Protector,"Very good for protecting all of your/my electronic equipment. Have other ISOBAR Surge Protectors, and I am more than satisfied with the protection they provide."
2,Every 10 seconds tuns off.,I'm having problem with that isobar cause after 10 seconds turns off; And this happened after 2 weeks that i bought.
4,"Good protection and build, poor design",Sturdy as hell and seems to be of high quality.My beef: outlets are too close together to support wall warts next to each other.
4,Very solid hunk of steel---hope it works as well as...,"...everyone says Tripplite stuff is supposed to work! It's a substantial and heavy piece of equipment with a classic and plain, no-nonsense design. The detailed technical diagrams and explanations on the outside of the box is an encouraging sign; it shows that this company is using substance to target literate and intelligent consumers unlike a company such as Monster which (like Bose) just lives off its marketing hype.I chose this for a new flat screen HDTV and BluRay player. I know it's not the ""Home Theater"" designated Isobar model, but didn't want to pay an extra $30-40 just for that...I figure this will do the job. Surprisingly, it does seem to have cleaned up the TV's antenna reception a little, by perhaps 10-20%."
4,Tragically humorous,"Author Flynn, a sometime management consultant, had a lot of fun with this otherwise tragic tale of a pack of misfits thwarting themselves and each other, and, amazingly, the technology they couldn't live without, until the universe finally turned and bit them on their collective posteriors.The humor also is in the prose, in which the author repeatedly turns cliches inside out and upside down and otherwise toys with words to the extent that smiles turn up in the most unlikely places. It is only a little annoying, investing so much time and affection in characters whose just deserts you can see coming a mile away, but are nevertheless disappointed when they inexorably arrive."
4,Character oriented science fiction tragedy,"Note - my 4 stars for this book is based on the scale that Amazon shows when you mouse over - I liked this book. I found it better than okay, but I salos didn't find it game changing literature.I will second the thought that some reviewers had that this book is perhaps a little slow. It probably could have been shorter and had more action. But I don't think it would have been the same book. Instead of an introspective tragedy about a crew doomed by their own humanity, it would have just been a space opera version of The Poseidon Adventure and not as successful. However, if you have the attention span of a modern (as in 2011) teenager, you probably won't like this book.On the other hand, if you have patience and a liking for cerebral writing, The Wreck of the River of Stars will reward you with rich character study, plausible science, and an overall well crafted story."
1,Drek,"I am not going to be particularly polite about this. While inspired, this book is a tremendous waste of ideas and literary talent. The characters alone would be enough to ruin the book, but Michael Flynn insists on badgering the reader at every turn. I cannot recommend this except in cases of wanton masochism."
5,Maybe science fiction has not died,"I read scifi for decades and then stopped. Too many brain-dead umpteen-part series with juvenile authors drawing cheap cartoons in their own heads.This book, all by itself, restored my faith that Asimov, Heinlein, and Bradbury were not a dead end. Mr. Flynn has constructed a story with the sort of tragic inevitability an ancient Greek poet might envy. Strung on the ribs of a seamless technical logic of hardest science fiction is a minor epic of the grace, hubris, brilliance, and stupidity of humankind. This novel is a stunning achievement. It is literature.I have no idea why certain people don't seem to ""get it."" Your Mileage May Vary, I guess. I suspect that our attention spans may have all been corroded by commercial media breathlessly racing toward the next commercial; the next cheap paperback.All I know for sure is that this book goes on my shelf alongside ""Gravity's Rainbow."" I look forward to reading Mr. Flynn's subsequent books."
2,Looks great but much smaller than described,"I received this product for a baby fat tailed gecko and it seemed fairly small so I measured it and the actual inside of the log is less than 1"" high and wide and maybe 4"" long. The height was measured to the top of the piece that sticks up on top and the overall length is about an inch shorter than it states. Do not purchase if you have an animal larger than an anole, small snake or crabs."
2,reptile not aquarium,"I purchased this very cute item because the product information said it was okay for an aquarium. The paint peeled within 2 weeks. It should only be used in reptile cages. It was smaller than advertised, 5.5x2.2x2.5, and expensive for what it actually is."
2,not a fan of this.,"This is really small.I have a 55gallon tank and this was the smallest thing in there.And it was too small for any of my bottom feed catfish to sleep in it.And the colors are gross.I like realistic colors and dull colors in my fish tank,this was just to weird and colorful for my tank."
2,Too small!!!,"I really should have looked at the size of this closer. Even at 6"" this thing is way too tiny. I saw larger ones in the pet store and thought this was the same product. Our baby corn snake can't even begin to use this. I've set it on top of a large branch to create a little overhang. It looks cute but it does seem to be a waste of money."
4,Not any new information,"I was searching for any new information and this book did not provide any. BUT, I did enjoy reading what information it did have."
5,Razor almost always delivers,"This is another great album by Canadian thrashers Razor. If you love thrash metal, you should get this album no matter how much it costs. It's kinda worth it. There are really innovative riffs on this album and there are 14 songs."
2,Leave the guide on the book shelf,"We used this guide to get us an hotel in Montezuma. We stayed at the Nature Lodge Los Fincas. It was a dump and we were forced to either stay or lose all of our money for the entire saty. We did what the couple before we checked in did. We paid them to leave. The rooms were covered with ants, triantulas, no constant running water....hot water, no way. The food was served with ants and bugs in it. I think this writer is either dillusional or just tells the hotels to get ready cause he is on his way. My advice, pick up another guide."
3,USAAF study popular version,"A popularized condensation of 12 official historical studies written by former high-ranking German Air Force officers for the USAF Historical Division. The officers candidly evaluate German World War II policy in the critical areas of training, procurement, leadership, strategic bombers, air transport, and jet fighters, and the conduct of lost battles - most notably against the Soviet Union."
5,As good as it gets,I received the product in a timely matter and it was the quality product advertise.
2,mire mimics,"I listen to the mp3 here, and believed the words of praise by other reviews and bought this CD.The production is bad. The music and vocal tracks are flatten together. Its sounds like a gray mush. The guy sounds like SRV and sings like him too. They just don't play with the same heart and soul.This CD mimics a great guitarist. .I was sadly disappointed."
5,WOW ! !,"If you like your blues-rock driving, fast, and energetic, then this is the CD for you. I feel that this CD captures the power that Indigenous brings to the live stage, much more than their two studio releases. I could listen to this CD for hours. Sure, Mato draws heavily from SRV and Hendrix (note their cover of ""Red House""), but he reveals not only his ability to handle the styles of the masters, but also his talent to craft a new musical niche. Pte, Wanbdi, and Horse help bring the music on the CD to an unbelievable plateau. You can hear the fuller band sound on their studio releases, but this one showcases Mato's guitar prowess. My recommendation: Listen to everything that Indigenous puts out to appreciate their versatility."
4,GREAT LIVE BLUES / ROCK CD,"This is a tour de force for INDIGENOUS and specifically MATO NANJI. Great playing, good songs, great recording. I bought THINGS WE DO a while back and was debating whether the 4 new tracks alone would make buying this CD worthwhile. Don't hesitate as even the make over the other songs receive in a liveenvironment make them a new experience and RED HOUSE alone is worth the price. Not since HENDRIX and SRV has a guitarist sounded like this in a live gig. For my liking he sounds a little to close to his heros and needs to develope further into a style that will be recognisable as his. He has the talent and a lot of time on his side. This would be 5 stars were it not for the similar tone and style of SRV and HENDRIX."
5,Killer Guitar Blues at it's best!,"This entire band is fantastic! As great as this CD is, it just doesn't do justice to the bands live performances. That doesn't stop me from buying all of their CDs. I can't wait for ""Circle"" with Texas legend Doyle Bramhall behind the engineering board.Check out the new video filmed at La Zona Rosa, here in Austin. Look for them on Austin City Limits on your Public Broadcasting Station in May!Come join the internet fan club.The bands management is always there to answer questions. They really love meeting their fans!Having met this band on several occasions, I can't say enough about them. Check them out for yourselves."
4,"Phenomenal Fretwork, But Not Much Variety","Now this is more like it! This is a far better representation of the band than their mostly lethargic ""Things We Do"" CD. Their performance here has tons more energy, & for the most part, it stays away from the slower, more pop-oriented tunes that ruined the previous release. Still, it has its drawbacks. While ""Holdin' Out"", ""Blues from the Sky"", & ""Water"" all showcase Mato's incredible Hendrix-SRV-inspired blues/rock guitar, they all pretty much sound the same, too. Also, the bonus track sounds like an acoustic reworking of ""Bring Back That Day."" ""I Wonder Why"", however, is a good Santana-flavored blues-rocker, & they close out the live portion of the CD with the 2nd best version of ""Red House"" I've ever heard (next to Aerosmith, not Hendrix). This band clearly has 5-star talent, and is just starting out. Once they find their own signature sound, watch out!"
3,these other reviews seem generous,"Just Bought this CD and it seems OK. Far cry from Intollerance and especially Grant's AMAZING Husker DU days. This record is pretty boring, the vocals are pretty drowned out and im not getting the feeling that his older material had. I would expect some better better drumming on this record too. It dosent say who did it but I dont think it was grant from the sound of it. I actually give this an extra star just for old times sake."
1,Do not buy,This is a horrible product. Returned and replaced this gun twice (hoping i might been getting defects). Could not get any of the guns to work. Would not sypher. Waste of money.
1,Doesn't live up to its name,"This book was very disappointing. I expected to find tips on finding cheap sleeps and cheap eats. There were tips, of course. But when I followed them, I found that they were not cheap at all! I thought the whole lay out of the book was confusing and uninteresting. There are much better alternative travel guides out there than this one. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it!"
1,Has the author ever VISITED San Francisco?,"I keep guidebooks on hand for my friends when they visit me in the Bay Area. This is the worst book I've ever mistakenly purchased by far. It's so bad that is as if the author wrote a book about things her Aunt Sally told her about a trip to SF in 1953. Clueless, yet humorous for natives. (She suggests a visit to some annual rodeo out here, and I don't think she meant it for cruising.) Do not for any reason (other than a laugh) buy this book."
4,Whoa! What a cool cooling rack!,"This really big cooling rack is well constructed with fairly heavy gauge material. It's very stable, even with awkwardly balanced loads, and since it looks great as well, I use it as a serving tray/trivet too!"
1,Defective rack sent twice! Very disappointing!,"I searched high and low for a very large grid-style cooling rack and was so pleased to find this one, especially given the wonderful reviews everyone had for it! I received one and after opening the box, which did not appear damaged at all, I was sorry to see that the rack was very badly bent, to the point that it could not sit without wobbling on the counter. The metal was so strong that it was not possible for me to unbend it with my hands. I didn't want to risk damaging it beyond being able to return it, so I went through the fairly easy return process with Amazon and ordered another. Lucky for me that return shipping was paid for since it was defective.Sadly, number two also arrived bent. Not quite as badly, but still badly enough that if I saw it in a discount store for $2 I knew I wouldn't buy it, so back it went.I give up on ordering one via mail and hope to find one in a retail store one day."
5,Rock with Substance,"Little Steven's latest album, ""Born Again Savage"" is one of the most well rounded albums to come along in years. The lyrics are meaningful and the guitar work is pure, old fashioned Rock. His recognition of fellow artists is refreshing and admirable.Some people critique Steven's mediocre vocal ability. While Steven may not be the most powerful vocalist in the world, his soul, conviction and lyical phrasing are among the most passionate. This album would have lost much of it's emotion had a vocalist been brought in to the studio. The rawness of the 'power trio' also added to the albums unadulterated charm.Many of todays releases are over-produced and lack soul. Only a financially secure, seasoned veteran could have created this work, which will become a rock classic."
1,horrible,If someone had told me 20 years ago that Little Steven could produce a record this bad I wouldn't have believed it. The music is third rate hard rock and is compounded by Little Steven's always deficient singing. The politics are laughable--who needs moral posturing from another middle aged rock/TV star from the cess pool that is modern rock music and Hollywood? The slogans he continually spouts are simplistic gibberish--as a grown up he should know better. This record continues Steven's decline both musically and lyrically. For someone who recommends such lofty reading in the liner notes this music is absolutely bitter and joyless.
2,Nothing original here.,"This is the last time I buy a album based on a ROLLING STONE magazine advertisement. The ad compared Little Steven to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin, if you want to hear good rock buy their albums instead. I found the lyrics sophomoric and childish at best. The only reason I gave it two stars is for Little Steven's guitar work and Jason Bonham's drumming. Don't even get me started on this guys voice. He is a good guitar player but he really needs to find a singer/songwriter to work with. Despite all this there are a few redeeming qualities to this album. My advise is try to find a used copy somewhere, as a matter of fact you can have mine."
5,JUST A GLIMPSE OF THE FACE OF GOD,"The title of this track says it all! ""Face of God"" (the fourth song on this CD) has Platinum written all over it. My husband and I cant get the lyrics out of our head. This album has a mix of Petty/Hendrix old rock throughout.Songs like ""Salvation"" and ""Camouflage of Righteousness"" are great songs as well. Kind'a bonus tracks considering ""Face of God"" is worth the purchase itself. Buy this CD before you hear it on the grammys. I'm sure you'll hear tracks on the Sopranos as well. Love this album!"
5,This totally rocks..,"After just seeing Steven with Springsteen and then hearing this incredible album, I cast my vote for the old guys as the best rockers...""Born Again Savage"" is solid all the way through, ""Face Of God"" and ""St. Francis"" literally gave me chills. The guitar/bass combo on Adam Clayton and Jason Bonham doesnt hurt either. Six stars, five is not enough.."
3,Could have been better,"While this is my first foray into the 'Wild Cards' series I have to say I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned the horrible proof reading job that was done. Mistakes are so abundant that eventually I was convinced that it had to be mentioned in a review. Every few pages there's a word that shouldn't be there and the reader is forced to guess at the meaning of the sentence, this does take away from the enjoyment of reading the book. The story is OK but again, as mentioned, rings of The Da Vinci type drama and secret organizations. You'll read through it quickly enough but it could easily have been better."
1,Dreadful picture,"We were looking for a ralatively low cost big screen for our weekend house and found this at Costco. They did not have their demo hooked up but assured me it was great.This TV proves the maxim ""you get what you pay for"". It has, without question, the worst TV picture I have ever seen [we have Direct TV]. Figures actually blur and wash out as they move across the screen.It also has limited connections - there is no way to run it through external speakers unless you run it through a receiver or pre-amp first.Fortunately you can return anything to Costco but unfortunately for me Costco is 180 miles from our weekend retreat. And this is a bear to move, particularly un packed!"
4,Great Price. Good Picture. Minor problems,"This T.V. i would say is more like 4.5/5 stars as it has a great price tag, has a good picture, and has a nice size. When hooking up DVD player in component it is gorgeous, i have yet to see better. Also the satellite picture is quite good as well. A couple of minor problems i have had is that there is a faint blue streak when the DVD player has a full black screen. I am not sure what causes this, but it seems to make me more mad everytime i see it. I have not yet tested any of the cables or the DVD player, so it could be that. All in all for the price it's definitely worth it."
5,Best self-help available!,"I have read many books of this type over the past three decades and Liberating The Adult Within is the best I have ever found. Helen Kramer, the author, writes clearly and provides great examples to illustrate her advice. She is the first person I found who dispelled the myths of codependency and shame. Christine Meinecke, Ph.D. did the same thing in her book written in 2012, but Helen wrote her book way back in 1995. Helen gives adults the tools to recognize the problems they encounter in everyday life. These tools really work to solve those problems, providing people are willing to look at themselves honestly and apply themselves to creating a healthier approach to living as an adult. Child-like emotions become understandable and malleable, allowing a people to grow towards mastery in life. There are plenty of Ah-ha! moments where the light bulb clicks on inside this book. It will change your life!"
3,Plain Speaking?,"There's more than one form of obfuscation. How typically Buckley for brother Reid to extol (forgive me) the virtues of plain speaking in one breath, while declaiming ""Don't divagate!"" in the next. It's one thing to celebrate the richness of the language and quite another to muddy the message with a vocabulary so rarefied that meaning is often lost completely---along with the reader's patience and appreciation. This is what Reid Buckley does all too well. Not clever!"
5,Strictly restricted to the art of speaking,"I have been looking for a book purely on the art of speaking in thse days and apparently this is the only one. Written in not-so-plain language and yet delivers a hugh collection of useful techniques. In particular, as pointed out by preceding reviewers, the six chapters on Mechanics are just great. hardly you can find so many practical advice in other public speaking books."
4,An excellent book for the beginner...,"Buckley obviously has a flair for language most of us do not, however, as one who speaks before audiences at least weekly, I've found his advice right on the money. An excellent book for the beginner, and a great way to expand your skills if you're a ""seasoned vet."""
3,NOT MARY STEWART,"This book is written by Mary Stewart Cutting (Cutting being the last name NOT Stewart). An old book about a fishing rod and the meaning of Christmas giving. It is not a bad book, but was misrepresented AS TO THE AUTHOR and not what I expected. I did flip through it, just not my cup of tea. It is however more than 24 pages, closer to 45 or 50 (I have my kindle set for larger letters and I counted 86 pages). Still it's a short read, not much more than a short story but it is complete. If you like Christmas stories set in a bygone era then you may really enjoy this and IT IS FREE."
1,Dangerous Tool!!! Waste of Money!!!,I bought this roofing tool to re-roof my 1500 sq ft home...it did not work properly from the beginning...was prone to misfiring - such as firing when first attached to the compressor - it finally blew apart after a couple of weeks with the top hitting me in the face...this tool is DANGEROUS!!! Spend the extra bucks and get a name brand tool that will do the job without a risk of maiming it's user. This thing should be taken off the market!
4,When is the next book coming out,"I flew through this book. I had no problem reading this one except that I got a little less sleep for a few nights. It's been a long time since I had a book that I couldn't put down.Looking foward to the next book,GJS"
3,you get what you pay for,"It's fine for the price. It's a bit too small for my duvet, and it is not a very soft flannel, but it looks nice. The colors are bright, as pictured."
4,Fun winter sheets,"The sheet's quality is adequate given the low price. I don't expect to get more that a coulple of winters out of them, but I really don't care; my girlfriend thinks they cute."
3,Good for the price,"We have the quilt-cover in the light blue penguin print (and navy blue sheets) and it is fine for the price. It sheds a lot of lint in the wash, but so far just a little pilling. (Used/washed several this past winter.)"
1,low quality and too short,"I got one Pike Street 135-Gram Fannel sheet sets and two duvet covers. I'm very disappointed. The fabrics are of very poor quality, the fabric thins after one wash and also fuzzes out (and they are not soft). They look like they won't last after a couple of washes or a few months' usage. Plus the king duvet is about 1ft too short. Is it worth the price? NO, I've gotten better quality for the same price on other sheet sets and duvet covers from Amazon before."
5,Z ZZ or ZZZ - your choice!,"Have had one of these for years and am replacing it because it finally died. A great idea - a simple, small, light digital travel alarm with a button that lets you choose nap times in 15-minute intervals. It's amazing that other clocks don't have the feature. For what it is, a masterpiece."
5,Travel clock can also work as a minute timer,"I've had two of these clocks for the past 10 years and absolutely love them! They run on a button battery but I've only had to change them once or twice over the years. I notice that the clue they are running down is when the light button gets dimmer, then you know you have to get the battery repaced. About the nap feature: I have discovered that if you hold the nap button and it shows 00:00, you can tap the minute button immediately and get a timer feature for under 15 minutes OR you can tap the nap button for the 15 minute increment and quickly tap the minute button to get a time in between the 15 minute increments. You have to be quick to do this!"
4,Perfectly musical,"This music cd is for easy listening of chants sung by Uma Mohan. Sit beack, relax and meditate. A blend of eastern fused with westerns nodes. An enjoyable retreat."
4,Innovative and Effective !,This is really a wonderful way to get today's younger generation to meditative mood with these Vedic chants blended with both Westeren & Indian Music....Many regid minded vedic scholars might not agree to this style and may pass a critique against this album. But I personally think it's very innovative and have not overlooked any vedic chanting rules. I admire Uma Mohan for having done this before some other westerener like Madonna or Jennifer Lopaz attempted it !Congrats Uma..Look forward for more albums like this !
2,Only for those with interest in horse racing history.,"This book disappointed me somewhat due to two factors. First, nearly all of the races that are discussed are from the pre 1940 era of horse racing. I was looking for something a little more recent. Second, they are also primarily races from England. If you are interested in strange old races from England, buy this book. Otherwise, save your money."
3,"good concept, lacks execution","Staple Free Stapler (blue)I was really excited about this product. In my business, I end up creating sets of papers, one that can be stapled in the normal manner and a second that goes with the packaging where the staple would be a detriment.I figured this would hold through the handling of the papers and then come apart easily.It seemed only the latter applied and it the bundles came apart just about as fast as I could ""staple"" them.Still the design concept excites me and I'd really like to see it developed in such a manner that it would be come the viable, useful tool I had envisioned."
1,Temporary holding at best,"I have owned this for a year now...and not used it for about 11 months. If you are asking yourself right now, ""Do I need a staple-free stapler?"" the answer is probably ""no."" It holds things temporarily, but you really can't ""trust"" it to keep the papers together like an ordinary staple will. That's an ok for some things, I guess...but it's what paper clips are for!"
1,Does not actually hold papers together...,"It holds paper together for about 5 minutes, maybe, as long as you don't touch them or move them.Sounded so exciting, but it's not actually worth anything."
2,staple free novelty,I purchased the stapler for use in my classroom. I find the staple free stapler to be a great novelty item but not much use as a stapler. The bond made is just not strong enough abd papers become unattached easily.
1,NOT Micro USB connectors,"Item was not what it was believed to be. Seller would not refund original shipping nor the return shipping after they said they would. Never purchasing from this seller again.these are REGULAR USB extension cords, NOT Micro USB extension.Lesson learned. the brand name ""Micro"" is a tad misleading.I shipped back to the seller and they did not refund my return shipping as they stated they would."
2,Entertaining but Long,"There are so many Roman Mystery writers out there now: Davis, Saylor, etc. Wishart's characters are a little similar to others and maybe a little more contrived. But the story works and the detail on the racing scene in old Rome seems valid enough. The numerous Roman names serve to confuse the reader so the actual solution to the mystery becomes secondary to finishing the book, which weighs in at about 550 pages."
3,"still reading it, but it's beginning to pall","This is the first book by thie author that I have read. I am about halfway through, but have lots of questions, since I am unfamiliar with the series. First of all, what does this guy, Marcus, really do for a living, if anything? Does he have a job, did old Rome have banks where one could keep their coinage and then go and get more for their purse? I'll bet most Roman slaves weren't treated as well as those in his household. And what was really annoying was his constant use of the word ""Pal"" and ""Yeah"". Good thing he didn't have to go up before Judge Judy - the Yeah word is verboten in her courtroom.I may try to get his first book about Marcus and then go from there. Not sure if I will finish this one, though. It's quite long."
5,Awesome,This is an awesome healing study course. It simply explains in detail everything we need to know about healing mentioned in the Bible.
1,What You Need To Know About This CD !!!,"[Amazon.com] has done a good job describing this CD, and have been waiting for this since last year (delayed production). BUT, until you order, and see it, you won't know that it is good for only ONE YEAR ! Does the ink in the print PDR dry up after a year? What a useful tool, only to be ruined by this insane license. This is for personal reference, and not every PDR edition has what the previous one did. Need to keep several years for reference, but not possible w/ this one year CD. WHY would anyone buy this?"
2,Cheap,Very cheaply made product. Will suffice for what I am looking for but not worth the price I paid.
5,Solved my shoe problem,This item is fantastic. It is the best item I have purchased this year! It leans against the wall inside my small walk-in closet and holds all my shoes. I highly recommend it!
4,easy and useful...,"well, so when i decided to get the shoerack i was a little concerned because of some bad reviews people saying that it will fall apart and its not good and i decided to try myself...The directions are really easy and i took 10 min to assemble it, it will not fall apart if you set it up in the right way. Its thin and does it well whats suppose to, hold shoes...But please put in the place first and then set the shoes up, this rack is not to be moved around because its plastic, i think it will last for a ling time, i am happy."
2,not recommended,"This item looked perfect. I got it put together and set up in my closet. I got it loaded with all my shoes. I called my son to come see my now neat closet and the whole thing fell apart!!! Shoes went falling everywhere. I am able to use the item, in 3 seperate sections, but the whole point was gaining closet space! I am disappointed."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I bought this product in January and have had nothing but issues with it since. I finally contacted the seller in the hopes of them accepting some kind of return. For the amount it costs, I would expect it to work. The pieces are flimsy and the bars are difficult to snap into place. After a few tries and the dropping of my shoes to the ground into a heap, I decided on glueing the bars into place. This worked for a brief period til the glue gave up on holding. Because it's plastic, the pieces are hard to bond together. I used industrial strength glue and it did no good. I wouldn't recommend this product. Looks like I'll be buying a small bookcase looking piece to use as a shoerack since products being sold as shoeracks are cheap bendable plastic."
5,cleaned up the closet floor,"I bought one of these and waited to see if I liked it. I liked it a lot, and I ordered another one. The free shipping was great because I could order the second one without worrying about shipping on the first and the second one. It is rather sturdy. Now, I can find my shoes without searching and searching."
3,"Not exactly as advertised, but decent.","It's a fairly nice shoe rack, however, it does not fit 30 pairs of shoes. I wear a 10.5-11 in men's and was only able to fit about two pairs of shoes per level. At most, this rack was only able to hold 20 pairs of shoes. It appears bigger in the picture posted here on amazon than it does in reality. Other than that, it seems pretty sturdy and does the job."
2,shoe rack,"this shoe rack was okay, but if you have larger shoes you will not be able to fit 30 pairs of shoes (as the box claims); or if you have high-top shoes-they do not fit either."
1,"I am a simple man with simple needs, for my shoes to be held adequately.","The 30 pair- Merrick, stackable shoe rack is ALL LIES and does not and WILL NOT hold 30 pair of regular sized shoes. If you are a normal sized male from teenage to adult, this rack WILL NOT suit you, the rack simply is too small for three pairs of shoes across and barely fits two. I was very displeased by this and my heart was broken. The inability to stack all of my shoes was a blow that impacts everyone. Now my shoes will roam the household Uncontained and most likely cause injury to a fellow family member or friend by tripping over a loose unshackled shoe. To add insult to injury they have denied ALL of my attempts to blackmail them into getting free things. For all these reasons I beg you, please help the world by NOT purchasing this product. Thank you and GOD bless. :)"
4,Great shoe rack,"Sturdy rack & assembles easily. Does exactly what it says, no more digging for a match - shoes stay in place. I was worried because I wear size 5 and most racks are spaced to far apart to hold small shoes."
3,30 Pair Stacking Metal Shoe Rack,"It was very easy to put together, the order came in at a good time. The only thing I don't like is the fact that I get scared it will tip over, I have small feet so my shoes are not extremely heavy my rack is 2/3 of the way full and I'm afraid if I put anymore shoes on it, it will fall over. Otherwise, works fine."
2,DOES NOT FIT 3 PAIRS,"DOES NOT FIT 3 PAIRS OF SHOES ACROSS HEIGHT IS FINE, NEED MORE SPACE. DOES NOT FIT 3 PAIRS OF SHOES ACROSS HEIGHT IS FINE, NEED MORE SPACE."
3,Wouldn't recommend,"I was so excited for this shoe rack at first. It really does hold a ton of shoes and is great for storage in a small living space. However, over time this product DID start to lean to one side - as another reviewer suggested - possibly due to the weight of my shoes. Another annoying factor - the poles of this rack are a cheap metal that started to rust and looked kind of gross after awhile. I would recommend purchasing the version of this rack with white poles - looks a lot better aesthetically. Also - $34 is a slight rip-off - the Container Store sells this exact product for $29.99 if you're looking to save a few bucks."
2,Looks Great - Quality Poor,I bought this for our 3 1/2 month chocolate lab. My husband put the collar on her and took her for a walk the next day. The pup pulled and snapped the collar and the latch broke so it was used less than one hour. The tag is cute and gives her some Steeler bling and the leash is great! I was very disappointed that this was ruined so quickly.
2,Small information-value added,"The book is most useful as a source of references. A wide range of planning tools and techniques are mentioned, but treated in very small depth, and the text denotes little practical experience of the author in the management of true corporations, as when he states that ''The planning of strategy to identify a firm's mission, goals and objectives, ..., represents the difference between success and failure in today's environment'' (sic). There's certainly much more to success and failure in real world corporations than that. The reprint of the Telecommunications Acts of 1996 and 1934 occupies almost half of the book."
5,Portal to Change,"There are tons of self-help books out there. Hogan and LaBay's contribution is one of the best because it shows how you can change your life and take control across the board. Through simple instruction and inspirational stories, they document and teach the power of the unconscious mind. In straightforward prose, they offer readers guidelines for improving their lives and maintaining those gains. If there are things you want to do differently in your life, start by buying this book. It is a portal to change."
3,Interesting Reading,"The author offers interesting perspective to our eternal soul, and some of the passages in the Bible - especially about Jesus. He does contradict his position about Mediums and ""cold readings"" at certain points in the book, but all-in-all this is a good book - worth the price."
5,Wonderful Spiritual Discussion!!,"Robert Browns discussion of communicating with spirit is the best book I've read on this subject from modern times. He answers current and common questions that all folks have, and that new mediums and psychics have as well. He is honest about his own discoveries and personal experiences in development, and offers great suggestions for those considering it. And, most important, to me as another working medium, although he discusses that he has read for royalty and famous folks (he is the mediums medium - reading for John Edward and James Van Prague), he keeps the content of the reading private; which all the more demonstrates his integrity. If you have even any small curiousity about spirit communication, and want a fast paced well written humorful way to understand it, get this book."
3,Just ok,"This item is FAR to heavy and bulky for it's task. It is reasonably well made, but you have to build it yourself (not difficult). The particle board it probably twice the thickness it should be, and weighs a ton. The design is innovative at least, though it is not especially attractive."
2,basic knowledge. inspiring.,"although inspirational, this program does not offer much more than the very basic information. not highly recommended"
3,good buy ....but,"Pretty, attractive spacious ,but zipper is not smoothe, Im afraid it may not be as durable as the bag itself."
4,Decent set of clubs,"The clubs were delivered quickly, and were brand new in the box. They are a little large for my 2 year old, but he uses the 9 iron pretty well (the others are a little to long right now). He's a pretty tall kid for his age, but these are definitely for 4 and 5 year olds. Other than that, no complaints."
5,Good starter set for a young golfer,"My 4 year old daughter loves it. The irons are the right size for her height and I assume these would last at least another two years for her height. She loves the driver and the putter too and is able use them comfortably. The clubs are strong yet not too heavy, and the grip is soft. Would highly recommend for any starting young golfer."
4,great,I bought this set for my 4 yr old. He loved them. Perfect size and light enough for him to swing effortless. I do recommend this set for kids under 5.
2,Should have been included free with the product it's pushing,"For the price, this is a very slim offering. Some nice information, great illustrations, but it's barely a pamphlet. And it spends a good amount of its ink telling us how we really should buy the author's planisphere. This little 'book' should have been included with the plainisphere. That would have made a nice package -- one I'd gladly have paid for. As it is, I just feel ripped off.If you ownNightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe, save your money. Dicknson's book has great star charts, and they point out which objects make good binocular subjects.A disappointment."
4,Surprisingly good,"Took me quite a while to outgrow this little book and I still come back to it every now and then. Even if you don't intend to seriously dive into astronomy, this book provides a good guide for an occasional backyard outing with a pair of binoculars."
2,A mere pamphlet,"This booklet (pamphlet) is something one would expect to find included with binoculars rated for star gazing. The information included is interesting, but very sparce, top-level and generic - and expensive considering what is contained in the booklet (it's about 1/8"" thick). Worth get only if you can find it (cheap) used at a garage sale."
5,"""Hard To Believe""","John MacArthur in one of his many books titled, ""Hard To Believe; The High cost and infinite value of following Jesus"" really hits home with what being a true christian really means. Especially in chapter one. After chapter one he tends to repeat himself however. This is only to reiterate the mere significance of the truth he is telling. As a born again christian and one who knows this true meaning, John MacArthur says everything you want to shout from a mountain top to express the joy you feel as a new christian. Other books by John MacArthur will help you keep that passion throughout your christian walk. So those are the Pros. The Cons for this book would be the repetitiveness, but again that is only to show the importance of what he is saying. I really enjoyed this book. Thank you Mr. John MacArthur."
1,Forget it,Not worth reading . . . too many assumptions (some absolutely false) made when characterizing other Christians!
4,MacArthur tells it like it is - mostly,"This book effectively counters the practice of the seeker-friendly movement. The only weakness I discerned is the tendency to paint that movement with too broad a brush. Not all churches who have a heart for the lost water down the message. Very solid biblically, though, as readers of MacArthur would expect."
5,Satisfied,"Books were an excellent price, brand new and delivered on time as promised. I have had this book for several years now and I paid much more than what I paid for these two. I could have purchased 5 books from Amazon for what I paid for one book several yrs. ago. This book is a great read, and true. I ordered these two as gifts. I needed these books to be here in a timely manner and this company delivered what they promised."
1,"more of ""salvation is free, if you are devoted enough""","Simply abysmal. More argument from MacArthur that God's free gift of eternal life is available to anyone who wants to pay a high price for it. This book will sound great to anyone whose theology tries to explain away God's invitation: ""Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost"" (Rev. 22:17). For those who seek eternal life from God, read the Gospel of John and drink freely of Christ's living water. For those who want to understand biblically how salvation is offered freely by grace through faith, but there is indeed a true cost to discipleship, read Bob Wilkin or Zane Hodges."
5,Wake up church!,After reading the back cover and the introduction I had no choice but to buy this book. MacArthur challenges the reader to listen to Jesus and enter the narrow gate. Christ didn't just die for us to have a smile on our face. He died for our sins!Just get this book.
3,Excellent Show but beware this release. Bad 5.1 Audio Episode 16,I love this series but funimation released a lemon this volume.The 5.1 audio in episode #16 is NOT right.Seems that the center channel plays on the front right speaker and there is no sound for the front left speaker.Other than this one episode the rest of the DVD seems fine.
3,Good for the price paid....not fantastic,"This item works as advertised with my sanyo HD700 camera. It does make it a lot wider. The magnetic feature has it's positive and negatives. Positive is that it's very easy to attach....SNAP. It's also easy for it to fall off, again...SNAP. Any quick movement will have this lens on the ground in no time. The magnet just isn't that strong. The buyer here was a good deal and cheaper than anywhere else found online."
4,Very excellent wide angle lense,I purchased this lense in 2008 for a Sanyo Xacti HD700 camera which I used up until mid 2012.It came with a defect in the lense but it NEVER showed up in photo's or video. Was perfect for extending the range the camera could see. Without this lense I would of been cutting off a lot of what I was shooting.Well worth the price.
2,Too much blurring and distortion,"I'm not too happy with this supplementary lens. I don't think it is multi-element, and there's unacceptable distortion and blurring at the edge of the image. Fun for the money though. I use it on a Canon SD400 Powershot. Also very easy to drop, lose or break. Always keep it on a tether attached to the camera."
4,excellent,"If you think Shadow and Chemist'sBrainfreeze: A Nonstop Live Mix of Strictly 45's and Exercise in Vinyl Destruction, is great, well, ok, you've got me there.But this disc contains full versions of all the crate-dug soul and funk that the 711 twins mashed together in that giant slurpee masterpiece.Inhairently, you are not going to get a lot of sweet soul on here: the songs Shadow and Chemist used needed to be hard and funky to edit together into their biting mix.But 70s chestnuts like ""Funky DJ,"" ""Turntable King,"" and ""Hey Joyce"" make this an excellent compilation.You gotta have good cherry to make a master slurpee."
3,This book was alright,"THis book was pretty good but The Brothers War (also by Jeff Grubb was alot better and Brothers War deserves 5 stars. If you liked this, go read brothers war."
1,Not as Described at All,"Description said Good-Like New. Book came with no dust cover and with several stains (coffee?) on the front & back cover, which is light beige, so very obvious. Would not buy again from this buyer."
4,The end of stargate?,"The Eight Season of Stargate is largley a success, but beckons the question of why there are two more seasons available on dvd. Season 8 wraps up all the storylines from the past few years, including the gaould, replicators, and some others. And it wraps them up well. I was surprised how a series 8 seasons in could still be so gripping and entertaining. Most shows would have just churned out more of the same, but this season really pushed the envelope. Well, except for Richard Dean Anderson, who was mostly phoning it in this season. Also, the last two episodes seemed out of place as the story clearly ended during the third to last episode. The last two feel almost as if they were done to complete a contract rather than actually forward a story.Overally, I was impressed with Stargate season 8. I liked the feeling that this show truly ended the series, and wrapped up a number of storylines. If you've enjoyed the show before, there's plenty to love about this season. Watch it!"
4,A buy I don't regret,"I'm a Stargate fan and bought this season because I liked a lot of episodes, the price was great and the pack is very thin."
5,no title,"Was good to see Richard Dean Anderson again. Was wanting to see this season, #8, for a long time. Was better than some of the reviews I read that said Seasons 8-10 were not quite as good as those critics were wanting. I enjoyed it."
5,The Prometheus + Dr. Jackson + Vala + General Hammond + a random chick with hiccups = One great episode,"First of all, seeing Dr. Jackson let go for a second was a relief. The fight scene between him and Vala was hilarious. Pretty sexy. The cough and ""what"" part is just perfect. You'll see what I mean ;PSecond of all, General Hammond (Don S. Davis) is a bad @ss. I love how he puts O'Neill in his place in this episode. As much as I love MacGyver in space, I need a break sometimes from O'Neill's snide and sarcastic remarks.The only thing that could have possibly made this episode better was a visit from the Asgard. I really love SG-1. :)"
1,very dumb,"This season was better then the last 6 season but a couple of the episodes were questionable. The story is too simplistic, predictable and down right dumb. Why they would allow an enemy that was unstoppable to see/view schematics on the only know weapon that was able to defeat that enemy boggles my mind. No matter how you look at it, this story was dumb."
4,Bought as a gift...,"I bought this boxed set as a gift for my girlfriend in 2005. The box is sitting on the living room table... yes, she's still watching them, nearly 6 years later! I think I got my money's worth!"
4,Excellent season,"As with all the Stargate SG-1 seasons, great story lines and a way of constantly keeping you wanting more. A continuing series that keeps new story lines coming."
2,Let's give a part to the director's brother!,"I object to nepotism in all its forms and especially in the entertainment industry. Samantha Carter is blond, beautiful and billiant and what does she get as her love interest? Short, fat and balding. Yes, Samantha Carter's love interest is none other than the director's brother. Presumably in an attempt to make their relationship plausible, they have tried to portray the director's brother as funny and charming and it is really quite painful to watch. I wonder how many handsome, talented and charismatic actors were sidelined so that the director's brother could get the part? For shame."
3,enjoyable sci-fi storytelling,although I enjoy Battlestar Galactica and Farscape more than SG1.... SG1 is an enjoyable ride in the sci-fi television universe. Amanda Tapping is especially good in the well-written role of Lt. Carter that she plays with enthusiasm.fun series to rent and watch over the weekend.
2,Good season marred by DVD mishap,"I won't go into detail about this season as many other reviewers have written wonderful synopsis of the episodes, but I will say this: a potentially five star season DVD has been reduced to two because it is simply not complete nor up to the quality of the season seven and six sets. 'Threads' is the shorter syndicated version of the episode and there is no commentary on it either.I'm sorry for giving this such a low rating, but MGM/Sony needs to get their DVD releases together,"
2,No Audio Commentary on all episodes for Stargate SG 1 S8,"I bought the Complete Series of Stargate SG1,and to my surprise Season 8's disks didn't have any audio commentary as mention in the Complete Series so I decided to buy Stargate SG 1-S8 Box Set; and to my amaze no audio commentary in episodes niether. I am returning the box set! By the way, Threads in box set and complete Series is a 105 mins."
2,More for the retailer...Some wear was an understatement!!,Box looked like it had sat in an open window for a year before being shippied to me...water and UV damage to the box was extensive...Discs look fine though.
2,"Stargate SG-1, Season 8","I could not watch all it because one disc will not play. What I could watch of the series, I would rate a 5 star."
3,Comments,"Slow to download and sometimes won't download. When turned on, program starts at the beginning, not where I left off. Stops frequently to ""buffer"".Content is excellent."
3,"Love the series, abhor the packaging (Low star rating for packaging)","Is it me, or the have packaging issues become a reoccurring motif? I only wanted to get the thinkpak for two reasons:1.) Storage space (I have the original box set, and it takes up too much space)2.) Getting the Threads 90min extended episode versionUnfortunately, the box arrived with damaged (and ripped) sides, and the DVDs were sliding around inside the cases (indicating two possibilities: A - Discs just fell off the fasteners; or B - The fasteners were broken, meaning the cases are defective).The good part was the discs just fell out of their placeholders, and thankfully were not damaged during transit.Also, I was hoping to get the 90min version of Treads, but I got the syndicated version.I'm wondering if getting the extended (originally 90min aired version, not 60min syndicated version) actually exists anymore?"
3,Stargate Season 8,"If you have not watched up to season eight of Stargate SG-1 do not read this. I own all seasons of Stargate SG-1 that are out right now. I absolutly love this shows and am glad that I have all the seasons so far, but I think that from season eight up the show got a little worse. It started declining when O'Neill became a General and ran the SGC. He was still a fair character and included in many of the episodes but it is not the same. Starting from season eight there were few off-world events. O'Neill did not belong behind a desk, but in the field.Over all, if you are a fan of Stargate SG-1 I suggest that you buy this season, but be warned that it is not the same show that you are used to from SG1."
1,Defected Disks,Disks 2 and 5 on season 8 do not work. Make sure you have these episodes downloaded or taped before you start your Stargate SG1 marathon!
4,More adventure than scifi,"For what it is, Stargate has remained a satisfying show. It isn't intellectual nor very deep, unlike Deep Space Nine, Farscape, and the new Battlestar Galactica. The characters are not drawn out that well, but the cast carries the show with their charisma. Rarely does a show still continue to be worth watching by its 8th season, but as I mentioned this isn't an intellectual show. There are lots of actions scenes, which really make the heart of the show. The dvd set has enough extras to satisfy fans."
5,Wicked,Cool Season. Cool box set. Threads short but don't really care. Great season. What else there need to know
3,Another Great Season,Another Great season I now have all 8Next years doesn't look as good McGiver is not in there I will Buy it anyway but I think it is the begining of the end for Stargate SG1 Stargate Atlantis is not the same either.Buy the way Sams club had this on sale before Amazon shiped it to me and I was on a pre buy list there price is also 3 bucks less that amazon 36.00. I was a bit disapointed in Amazon for that I could of had it sooner and cheaper :(.
3,Not nearly as good,"This season of Stargate is not nearly as good as the other seasons.If you like the charector of Daniel then go ahead and buy this season. However you barely ever seen O'neill.It's very anoying! Micheal Shanks is not suposed the star of the show. However in this season its all about him, Carter, and Tealc. I wish O'neill had been more in it. This show is OK without Colonel O'neill."
2,Unable to play Citizen Joe or Reckoning One,"Disappointing DVD ruins a great show. When I go to play either episode on volume four, the player goes back and plays 'Good to be King'. If I try to jump to the middle of either one, I get a black screen. Same behavior when I try to go to the extras menu.I love the show (even with Jack sitting on the sidelines more this season), and after buying 7 perfect box sets, this is rather disappointing. Shame on their quality assurance and shoddy manufacturing."
1,Whole year.,"You cought me a work, so I do not have the product here to see a title to give you a reveiw on. I enjoy all eight years that I have purchased the DVD's on. I have VCR recordings of the shows that have mot yet been made available on DVD yet. I enjoy the attidutes that the program protrays. As well as the good clean (for the most part) family qulaity of the shows.It is refreshing in this day and age."
3,Not their best work,The ThinPak is great. Wish each of my seasons was ThinPak. The material is not the best. You could watch maybe 4 or 5 episodes and have a complete season 8. It does wrap everything up nicely at the end. If you have the other 7 seasons you might as well buy it.
2,Another good season of the show - DVD extras disappointing,I love the show and season 8 was great. Except for the first season boxed set I have brought all the rest from Amazon - Zone 1 - when I am actually situated in a Zone 4 area. I was disappointed with this boxed set especially since there was no extended Threads episode but even the shortened one did not have a commentary. The Zone 4 boxed set was released on August 17 - well before the Zone 1 - and it contains more features and the extended Threads episode. I see from another review that the Zone 2 boxed set also has more features. So I've got to wonder why MGM didn't include the extras on the Zone 1 boxed set? Will the same happen to the Stargate Atlantis boxed set?
1,I LOVE THIS SHOW....BUT..........,"this DVD set comes with the shorter version of the episode ""Threads"". It was originally broadcast as a special 90 min episode and then rebroadcast as a shorter 60 min episode(probably for syndication). Well the episode included with the DVD set is the shorter version.Is Sony/MGM turning into Paramount now??? This is such garbage!other than that, this set is great!! if the original broadcast was included, i would have given this set a 5-star rating!"
5,Stargate Season 8,"I would recommend any Stargate episodes to anyone who is a Stargate fan. I have really enjoyed watching Stargate over the past 10 years, and I am looking forward to getting the two movies Arc of Truth and Continuum. I did miss Richard Dean Anderson when he left Stargate after 8 years, but I still enjoyed watching the episodes when they aired on the Sci Fi channel. But I would definitely recommend Season 8. I loved all the episodes and especially the speacial features. They were great.[...]I was amazed that Stargate lasted for 10 years. It's such a great show. So I hope it keeps on going for years to come."
5,Rothko A Negative For Francis,"It's as if there were no music. Just sound. And then there was melody. Rothko look as if they have discarded the clothing of expected structure, and once you've been seduced by the beautiful open-ness, Wham. Textures usually reserved for dark spaces; sounds only heard in the subconscious filmic moments of life. Song titles have no meaning, only ""feel"" and ""movement"". Like jazz but on another channel. If air could be seen, this would move it within our sight. Punk. pop, love, desire and need are all here. Negative For Francis pushes those buttons. Gently."
2,Defect. Cheap material and part,"I bought 2 and 1 of them is defective. It took me 2 hours to set up 1 and modify the parts to make it work. However, parts were damaged after the modification."
2,"bought 2, returned 1","I bought one of these items and it was perfect. So I bought another one. It arrived with the top wood surface badly split and completely unusable. The paperwork with it included a form to request a replacement part, with a fax number. The fax number turned out to belong to a private citizen unrelated to the manufacturer. So I had to return the item to Amazon. Well, so that's a 50% success rate with this item. I probably will try a third time though, since Amazon's return policy makes it risk-free for me. But Amazon, you should hassle the seller for putting in an incorrect fax number on their replacement-part form!"
4,So Far So Good,"This stand was very easy to put together, took me about 20 mins to half an hour altogether. There is something funny going on with the drawer - it closes nicely, but as soon as you put in this wooden peg they've provided (so that you can't accidentally pull the drawer out the entire way), the drawer doesn't close flush with the rest of the stand anymore. It doesn't bother me too much, and in fact I was going to leave the peg out, but it's in a corner of my office with my printer on top of it so I figured I'd be safe (with the wooden peg) rather than sorry when all my papers spill everywhere. Still a great piece for the price."
4,Good product with minor assembly issues,As these looked like they would be better than the many we looked at we brought two tables. With a little supervision I found that a couple of our kids could mostly assemble it. However both tables had a hole - the same hole - that was half an inch off from the correct position. So we needed to drill new holes. Also it was necessary to round off the back corners of each drawer so that it would close fully without snagging on the back legs.Once assembled we were all pleased with the result.
5,"Pretty good, especially for the price","Looks very nice, perfect as a nightstand. Was only a little bit annoying to put together. Overall it was the most I could expect to get without spending a lot of money."
5,night stand,excellent quality....it took a little time to put together but....it could easily pass for a designer expensive....if you are looking for something like this... you found it....i don't think you would be dissappointed
3,two tables different finishes!,"I would give a five stars, althought they still could learn from IKEA how to master the precission of the pieces for the self assembly. Unfortunatelly the finish of the top of the both tables is different. One looks like is made out of one piece of wood, the other of the small pieces with the zig-zag like edges!!"
4,the reason,the reason it didn't get a five was beause the color was a little lighter than i thought. but it's perfect in every other way. thank-you
2,Blond color,"I chose a two star as this is a blond color, and very wobbly. I put a inkjet printer on it and it shakes like crazy when printing so not very sturdy. I am 66 and fairly easy to put together and unlike other peoples post all of the holes lined up perfectly. I think if I had it to do all over again I would spend a little more and get a better quality table. The bottom shelf is a yellow color and does not match the table at all so for cheap it is ok but we will paint it this summer outside. I guess it depends on what you want to use it for but beware it is an awful color that the legs are different and the shelf so if that is what you want you will certainly have it with this one.....Get a nicer one"
3,Looks better than it's built,The weakest element of this product is the drawer. It could be more stable. But I love the look and the wood is not cheap. I use it in the bedroom.
4,Winsome wood end tables,"I received them in a timely manner. Need better directions to put together. Over all, they are sturdy tables and put together well. I ordered three, and by the time I put the second one together, they were pretty easy."
4,Christmas gifts,"I bought two of this style table, one in the natural finish and one in the dark brown finish to serve as nightstands for two different bedrooms. They were easy to assemble and felt fairly sturdy when done. The drawer bottom could have been made of a more sturdy material, in my opinion. Both tables were delivered in a timely fashion and my daughter was very pleased with them."
5,Totally Thrilled!,"I never purchased a big item online before, and was a bit concerned by some of the negative reviews I read (although there were very few). But I really liked the price of the night stands so took a chance (bought 2). They arrived BEFORE the projected delivery date and were in great shape! They were a little difficult to put together ONLY because I am a woman and had to hand tighten everything, but after I was done and had them in my room, I was very happy. They are exactly what I needed. The only small drawback is the drawers aren't very deep so you can't store much in them. Also, to attach the knob, don't use their long screws that are provided, use a shorter one. It's much easier! I totally recommend this company."
2,Wouldnt buy again,Would not buy again or recommend to anyone. Putting the table together was difficult the holes were not big enough for the screws. Also when attempting to put together a piece of the table bended and we had to hammer it back in place. The table also wobbles.
1,Piece of Junk Furniture,"After forty-five minutes of frstration I gave up and put my self and this Junk Table out our my misery by throwing everything away. I will never purchase a piece of furniture that has to be put together again. The Instructions, Table Quality, Tools and Other Hardware to put this table together were HORRIBLE. I will probably boycott Amazon.com over this product and never use their Web Site again to purchase anything.Thanks,Mike Graham, CPA7-11-2011"
2,Against a wall,"This piece definitely isn't what I had hoped for. However, it was easy to put together, and it is sturdy. You pretty much have to have this piece up against a wall, as there is no back piece on the main frame to hide the back of the drawer. <br />The allen wrench it came with for assembly became 'rounded out' before I could finish with all the hex screws. Be aware that you may have to pull another one out of your toolbox to complete assembly. <br />"
4,Great,The end table fits nice and pretty much matches the bedroom set. It is nice and sturdy and exactly what I was looking for. The price was right.
4,end table,Nice table for the price. Very pleased with the appearance and fit perfectly in the room it was purchased for.
4,Great value,"Got this table for our 3-yr-old's bedroom, and it is well-built, sturdy and a nice color natural wood. Could not beat it for the price, it will probably be around decades after our daughter leaves home since there's nothing fancy like metal drawer slides on it to break. Just an all-around nice little table."
3,"Beautiful, but Drawers Suck","The Night Stand looks great. The directions are pretty simple and direct. I got everything put together in accordance with the directions, but when I went to insert the drawer into the Stand it wouldn't close all the way. It keeps catching on sides at the back of the Drawer. The side pieces that make up the legs has a slight lip on both sides that causes the drawer to catch and not close.I would not buy this unless you have the tool to sand that lip down smooth."
3,"Good material, poor workmanship","The nightstand was delivered quickly and the wood is good quality. However, the pre-drilled holes do not match at all (they are more than 1/8 of an inch off and I will have to drill new holes to finish assembly). I don't think it's expensive to drill holes where they're supposed to be, so I'm not sure how the good price figures in here. Scratching my head..."
3,$107 Retail Price? NOT!!!,"If Wal Mart sold this table it would be about $25. The color is lighter then the picture and the bottom of the draw is cardboard. The table went together easy in about 25 minutes. For what it is, it is a good table/nightstand. But it is nothing special."
2,Poor QC,"Purchased 2 units - finger joing splices on table top but shelf was good on first unit assembled: table top on 2nd unit good but shelf has finger joint splices. For $40, I expected Quality Control???? :o)"
3,"Nice table, but poor quality drawer materials","The table looks nice and is made in Thailand of a local hardwood pieces glued together. The legs are attached with screws and are reasonably sturdy (don't sit on it or place anything heavy on it). However, the drawer materials are made of sawdust compositon board and split when the attachment screws are inserted. The material also will not secure the screws well, as it it too soft. Therefore, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND glueing the components of the drawer together, or they will eventually fall apart. Due to the poor quality of materials in the drawer, I lowered the rating to 3-stars."
2,"Winsome Wood End Table/Night Stand with Drawer and Shelf, Natural","This product is cheap and every piece of wood appears to belong to a different stand. Simply put, it does not at all appear like the product you see pictured on the websight. The bottom of the drawer is actually made of cardboard and the simulation of wood on the bottom shelf appears to belong to a different product. If I can say one good thing about it is that it is a stable piece of furniture. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!"
2,Not worth it!!,"I normally don't write reviews, but after receiving these tables I had to chime in. I bought two of these tables because I could not find anything in my local area that would work as night stands in this color. I was very eager to put these together when they arrived so I got started! Table one took me an hour to put together! I have put together many pieces of furniture in my day so I like to think I know what I'm doing. The holes on these do not line up!! At all! I had to find another way to put the table together and finally got it to work. So I thought table two would surely take less time...I was wrong! The layout of the holes for each piece was even worse. The price is good and once put together they look nice, but to me it wasn't worth it! I would have returned them but after 2 hours, sweat and lots of cursing, I wasn't about to take them apart to ship back! Don't waste your money!"
4,Clean and Simple,"I bought this nightstand to match the Winsome Wood audio cart I already owned. The nightstand is low in price, good-looking, of good quality, and went together well. However, there were two small problems: I had to sand the bottom of the drawer because it was a little too large to fit the space for it and, more interestingly, I discovered that the stopper for the drawer has to be added after the drawer has been inserted. I had to sand down the stopper before I could get the drawer in. Live and learn."
3,"Looks Nice, BUT....",I haven't had a nightstand in months! and to say its inconvenient is an understatement. So when I got the Winsome Wood End Table I was ecstatic! I put it together immediately anddddd the drawer didn't fit. Like really? I could barely get the drawer to close and am basically pretending it doesnt exist at this point. That could be contributed to my building skills but I'm usually pretty good about this kind of thing. If you are very savvy when it comes to building you will likely have no issues and love this end table. Otherwise beware! It doesnt put together cleanly :/ good luck!
3,Almost good,"The end table looks good.Some parts did not fit exactly,so I had to cut them a bit.The drawer has no rails,(it does not look nice when it is openand it is not straightforward to close it)."
5,Cute + practical hamper,"Not only does this hamper do well in any kids room (it's unisex), it also features a removable mesh tote bag that lines the inside. It makes getting the clothes to the laundry super easy. Plus, a flap up top can keep the messy pile inside the hamper out of view for those who like organized nurseries."
3,Alright,"It's definitely cute, it only becomes a problem when you need to staple more than a couple pages."
3,Eh,"It works adequately most of the time, if you have three sheets or less. But not consistently. I was a bit disappointed. It doesn't completely entrap the flap each and every time, when it cuts a flap to tuck in, in lieu of a metal staple."
3,"it works, but not nearly as well as a real staple","It pokes a quite noticeable hole in the paper that it folds over and tucks into a slit. You probably wouldn't want to hand out a resume looking like that, unless you were applying for an environmental job. In that case, you probably shouldn't have a resume that takes more than one sheet of paper. It doesn't feel near as strong as real staple."
1,Wrong temp,"I have it hanging outside and it mostly says it is 60, but sometimes it moves to 40. Of course, that is when it's 20 or 30 degrees hotter or colder. Very disappointed. The theremometer is beautiful, but just doesn't work."
4,Very nice fantasy book - 2nd in trilogy...,"The ""Kingdom of Summer"" is the 2nd book in GillianBradshaw's Arthurian trilogy. Its story line continues where the""Hawk of May"" left off and ends before ""In Winter's Shadow""The story follows Gawain and his servant Rhys as they move through dark age Britain to fight for the light. Anybody with a liking for Arthurian romances will like this book."
5,Nice Product,Nice product. Excellent value for the price. Very convenient to use and install. Shipping quickly.
4,Love it!,"Stands high enough and numbers are large enough to be seen/read from inside the house. Can't tell the accuracy of the rain gauge because I haven't done the math), but can at least have a relative measure of what's going on. (The 1"" mark is higher and the tube wider than the 1"" mark on my previous narrow tube gauge; so no idea which one is correct"
1,Not pleased.,The thermometer is inaccurate and the rain gauge is is poor quality. The post into the ground is unstable. In short this is junk.
2,Don't waste your money,This is a joke! It is a very very very beginner level in which you can read from the textbook by yourself instead of spend $30 on this DVD. I do not recommend it to anyone. You will not learn how to edit or mix at all. It is just the DVD telling you what Pro Tools LE is. Then you have to buy another DVD to learn how to use Pro Tools! What a waste!
5,Another excellent career exloration video,I ordered this tape and several others in the series to help my son decide what he wanted to do after graduation. Seeing and hearing workers in the jobs talk frankly about their work- the good and bad parts! -- really gave him a good idea of what it would be like to work in lots of different jobs. I've also decided to change jobs myself after having watched it! I recommend these tapes to anyone who is clueless about what to do with their life!
2,Not what I thought,"This product is pretty much just an ""eh"" or ""ok"" in my book. I expected to smell a true rose and sweet ylang ylang with a base of sandlewood. Instead it just smelled like caress soap and turned the water pink. It didn't make my skin soft. Fortunately there was no after-smell so I didn't smell like an old lady. Sorry! I wanted to like it, but wasn't impressed!"
1,a complete waste of my time.,"I found this story to be nonsense and regret spending my reading time with it. I used poor choice in trying to give this. .99 ""deal"" a chance. I should have deleted it early on. :("
1,Awful Book,Some of the things in this book turned my stomach. it could have been a good story with out thses parts.
3,They are just good,"I bought this set for my wife and I have two complains about it...First, it suppose that set would have 3 differents tools and one of them is the not correct. It comes twice.Second, after use 9.5 pan for warm up some tortillas (just warm them up, not cook), eggs sticks is span. the non-stick interior is so delicate.I do not recommend this product."
4,Good Insert for a Strong outside bag,Good Insert for a Strong outside bag since the actual insert is rather thin and will tear. However if you have the clear bag in the picture I have found it to be not great but pair it with a good reusable bag and it works great!
3,Not Easy to Use,"I purchased this product to make 150 Election Day cupcakes. This product takes a lot of effort and I'm no whimp. After swirling the first 20 cupcakes, I switched to a standard 16 inch decorators bag and went to Plan B - blue icing on half and red icing on the other half with red, white and blue star sprinkles.When I have a chance, I'm going to trim the bag so the opening is larger and see if that helps; if it does, I'll amend this review."
3,Alternative,"Instead of getting these, why not just put two disposable bags into another. Even using three bags would probably be cheaper than buying specialty.If you have a food sealer, you can seal one bag down the middle and put that into another bag. (You can't just use the sealed bag because the plastic fitting wont go down the seam.)But, if you have the money to spend. These will work nicely as well."
4,Swinging with the Liverpool Scene,"I bought this album secondhand on vinyl when I was a teenager and cherished it. Yes some of the poetry is self-consciously ""hip"" and politically conscious, but so what -- if you like albums recorded by beatniks like The Fugs or Allen Ginsberg then you will love this album. And the first reviewer neglected to mention one more beautiful song, Gliders and Parks (Spiders and Larks) which is one of the most haunting songs of lost love I think I've ever heard. The songs that are good are very very good. No aficionado of hippie/beat culture can afford not to hear Percy Parslow's Hamster Farm or Burdock River Run. I always saw the Liverpool Scene as a poetry collective where some people were stronger than others, anyway."
3,Absolutely unique,"This material is not especially good, but you have never heard anything very much like it, ever. The material is all self-satirical, something the previous reviewer clearly missed. If you don't take yourself, the era, or the material too seriously you will have great fun with these songs. It is rather stupid stuff, but it is much more intelligent and musically interesting work than, for example, Beatles songs from the same time period."
4,"Overall a Good Book, But Still Too Many Errors","Finished reading this cover to cover; overall a very good book, but still contains a lot of errors that should have been corrected in previous editions. I printed the latest errata from Cisco Press's website before reading the book, then meticulously went through each item and made corrections to it as needed (there were several pages of errata, btw). Well, after reading the entire book, I found at least two dozen more rather-obvious errors that were not mentioned in the errata (not just grammatical; many are coding errors and references to items in figures that don't exist). Unfortunately, this problem does seem typical of Cisco Press (and Sybex, as I'm currently discovering)."
1,Poor Exploitation of This TV Phenomenon!,"Despite brief comments from minor members of the ""Top Ten"" from various seasons of AMERICAN IDOL, this DVD offers little information that the viewer didn't already know. Without access to the actual program, we get very brief scenes of contestants performing outside of the show... comments from very minor celebrities and comedians- this all adds up to a very boring and uninformative waste of time. Season Two contestant Corey Clark gets a lot of attention(he was kicked off for having a criminal record, and later briefly caused a scandal by revealing he had a relationship with judge Paula Abdul). And most heinous of all is the amount of time spent viewing ""nobodies"" of various ages singing the Nationl Anthem in a mock-audition setting! This DVD isn't worth the time renting, let alone purchasing!"
5,Great Source of Information,This book is a great investment for anyone who wants to pursue writing romance stories. I found it worth every penny and then some.
3,Not enough!,"This is a good book, but if you have never published a book before, you will need something more to go with it. I do like the part where she tells you exactly how to write each scene though. It tells quite a bit of information, but to me it's not enough!"
4,Fate Night Box Set,"I can't really write a review for this item, only because I got it as a christmas gift for my brother. But I will comment on the fact that the box set arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape! Thanks will definitely do business with you again!"
2,Nothing special about this series,"I purchased this product based on the reviews seen here. All I can say, they are probably created by preteen boys. At their age, I can't fault them for it because I liked Voltron at that age too.The series consist of mostly fighting. As such the enemies become more difficulty as the series progresses. So, it's episodes can be similar to that of Angelic Layer without the fun, enjoyment, and an actual storyline.There is some romance. It can be as stale and lacking as is in Green Green or DearS.For a similar fast pace action and better series look toward Angelic Layer. For romance, choose Chobits. If you want gut breaking heartbreak then Elfen Lied would be a good choice. Warning, Elfen Lied is not a kid friendly anime."
4,magical,"Worth it. The action was fun to watch, but there were funny scenes as well. The characters are also great. Don't forget the movie!"
4,Pink case for my daughter,"I bought this for my daughter's ipod. It works perfect for her, she can attach it to hes school bag, gym bag and sometimes she even attaches it to a lanyard. The only problem is that she has to take it out of the case to charge it and it is not so easy to take it out. Other than that, Its perfect!!!"
3,Loved and Hated it,"I purchased about 6 of these and have loved how sturdy they have been as I traveled to/from Africa every year for the past 8. The body has held up perfectly and the contents too! Unfortunately, the combination locks broke on all but the newest (not enough travel maybe?) - doesn't matter the number, it'll pop open. The other problem is wheeling it around. They always seemed to fall over like a badly planned SUV.... Case is too thin and tall and wheels too small..."
2,Beautifully made ... Extremely biased and annoying,"Nice documentary beautifully made. However it's very annoying to see someone being proud and showing off, or maybe simply justifying the slaughter of 250,000 thousands civilians (without accounting for the long term damages and army casualties). Why don't we see it the other way. Would we enjoy a Japanese documentary saying that it was the right thing to do to kill the same amount of US civilians by H-bombs or whatever, because there were no other way they could win the war?"
1,Don't be Fooled,"I purchased this flatware set earlier this summer. I thought that it had to be great quality stuff, because it was very heavy and I bought it from a reputable department store. Boy, was I wrong. I washed my set one time in the dishwasher and almost all of the pieces had rusted while in there. The cycle was 45 minutes long and it had a heated drying cycle. So it is not like my flatware was lying in puddles of water. I am very disappointed with the quality of this flatware. I should have purchased the Onieda flatware like my mom said. Be smart...go with someone else for your flatware needs."
5,This is a Great Book!,"This isn't the kind of book I would normally buy. I don'tusually read historical fiction. In fact, I stick to John Grisham,Scott Turrow, and James Paterson. But since it was a gift, and since I needed something to read on my flight from NY to LA, I picked it up. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The first part read like a thriller and the second part like a legal drama. There are so many things going on, and yet Pesci made it flow. It's a great read and even more stunning because it's a true story. I can't wait for Pesci's next book."
3,"Well told story, poor editing","This book is an interesting and well told account of the famous Amistad mutiny and trial. It is NOT the book the movie was based on, and I think Pesci does a better job of telling the story than Spielberg did. I picked it up in a small bookstore shortly after it was published and was presently surprised. However, there were typographical errors and sloppy editing which I found very distracting."
2,Uncle Tom's Cabin?,"If you're looking for an anti-slavery tome, read ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". Harriet Beecher Stowe did a better job of writing her story and she did not confuse her readers by mixing historical fact with fiction.Frankly, the writer does the slaves no service at all by their stereotyped portrayal. While the main character Cinque (sp?) is breathlessly described again and again as the noble ebony Adonis, the other slaves seem to suffer a bipolar disorder-- either they are sitting on the deck muttering among themselves, or they are jumping around hysterically, shrieking and waving their arms. Surely a more human portrait of the slaves would have been the more accurate.Too often, authors who aspire to promote a noble cause wind up editorializing instead of writing and the resulting work becomes stale and lifeless. I'm sorry to say that Pescis book is more in this vein. ""A Tale of Two Cities"" it is not."
5,Does anyone have a spare copy?,Does anyone have a spare copy or can make me a copy or just want to get rid of this tape? Willing to pay. Pls e-mail me
5,A Firm Believer since Volume 1,"This is volume 6An outstanding workout when you want something a little lighter;but you can add intensity by using a higher step up box. Remember the Firm is into shocking your body so there are moves in this work out that are different -- moves shouldn't be done the same all the time anyway.Since The Firm dosen't sale these older volumes anymore and this was one of the last true ""volumes"" it has become a collectors item for those of us that truly know the Firm. Enjoy!"
2,"Short, Clear and Bias","Esposito do not blame the fundamentalists only for the conflict but also he blames the misunderstanding of America and its policies toward the Muslims world for escalating the conflict.Esposito has his own agenda, as he is the founding director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, he want to see a dialogue between the West and Islam. Interestingly that the center he founded is funded by a Saudi Billionaire Prince, a connection which makes Esposito judgments questionable somehow.Also he tries to present liberal Islam (he calls it reformed) as a strong candidate to defeat the terror creed embedded in fundamental Islam. While he forget that most of the Muslim figures he is referring to have little weight in the Muslim religious arena."
4,A good book,Read the book for yourself and make up your own mind; for all the critics i have only one question: did you really read the book?
5,Professor Esposito tells it realistically,"Not based on what Islam should be but based on what Islam is, Professor Esposito reveals a cache which is shocking. From the educated Muslim to the inventive fundamentalists of Islam it is here in this book and backed up. Revealing the history of Islam is not what it used to be, we are in fact facing radical groups which are in much greater numbers than wishfully thought. I cannot recommend this book enough along with another fantastic book similar which offers solutions is SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox."
4,Mark of Damnation,"In this episode of Warhammer, we find ourselves following the promising army officer Karl Hoche on the downward spiral of destruction. After discovering corruption within the ranks of the trusted Knights Panther Karl is sent to bring word to the proper authorities.If you learn nothing else from me, know this...NEVER trust anyone! Chaos is insidious and you never know where its tendrils may take root. Karl narrowly escapes death at the hands of the Knights Panther and is enlisted by the secret order of the Untersuchung. After completing the rigorous training he is sent to find the location of a missing agent. Along the way he is betrayed at every turn ( `cause he didn't listen to me) and finds himself becoming that which he seeks to destroy.Infected by chaos Karl must find the source of the evil and destroy it before it subjugates him completely, before it takes over his entire world."
4,Job Seeker,"This isn't your stereo typical Warhammer Novel. Karl Hoche is pulled into a complex chaos conspiracy. There is a sequence of role changes for him, Soldier, Secret Agent, Heretic, Bandit Leader and Mercenary as he travels on his long journey to being a ""Chaos Hunter"". He is well and truly scared by his experiences. There are many sub-characters in this journey but most are fleeting with short-lived roles to play. The novel is by no means predictable and although it felt a bit rambling at first I was hooked by the end."
2,Not quickly absorbed,"The description on this item says that this is quickly absorbed, however, in my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I have tried to time out exactly how long it takes for this to be absorbed into my skin - so far it has been 4 hours today and I still feel VERY greasy. I'm guessing it will be at least another 4! If I try to put on a wet/dry powder foundation it gums up and looks awful. I won't say that this product doesn't do a good job of moisturizing, but I can't stand this greasy feeling. I have used Caudilie, Decleor, this, and now Dior Hydra Advantage. This, BY FAR, is my least favorite."
1,Sub optimal design,This is the second Bobelock hemostat I've had. The first leaked all over my $1000 GEWA leather case. The vendor offered me a replacement velvet cover that 1) didn't match and 2) required that I install (sew) it in manually. Not my idea of customer service for an item that expensive. The filler in the second one was so densely packed that none of the water evaporated. The only resolution was to return it. My advice for prospective Bobelock Humistat customers is to find another product.
2,Right wing and religious,"Good for the right wing, religious individual or (for those of us who are neither) those looking to expand your horizon. Must have a VERY open mind to read this book if you are not spiritual or are more liberal.Well written, interesting arguments, just not for me."
5,Trust blasts Pragmatism,"If you have been wondering why you're so frustrated watching the News, you need to read this book.Les Csorba has identified a major defect in our culture. Our motivation is all screwed up. We need to do what we do because it is the right thing to do - not just to get the results that we want.This book calls a spade a spade and gives helpful solutions to a broken and bleeding culture. It calls us all to be leaders.Very worthwhile reading."
3,Ordered new but recieved used item,"I was pretty sure that I ordered a NEW book as i have always ordered new books, but I was very disappointed when the product arrived and that was highlighting and markings in the book! I am not happy about that..."
4,Can this guy sing ......,"This guy has a voice that stands out from the rest of the so, so, whining soul crowd today - a true singer's singer ..... stand out tracks for me are Til the 6 is 9, the day you held me and in your arms ....... money well spent"
5,Love Is On My Mind - Tim Dillenger,"This CD, by far, is one of the best I've heard in a long time. Tim's soulful voice is incredible! I just can't get enough of this multi talented artist. Every track displays his undeniable talent. There's a little of everything, for every music lover, on this spectacular project; from R&B; to Jazz to Pop to Rap, with heart wrenching ballads, as well as fantastic dance tunes. Too wonderful to miss! I highly recommend purchasing this CD.A true music lover,Sunshine Brown"
4,Nice light,Only use for seeing time middle of night. Must hit clunky button for illumination but it works fine if not elegantly. Nice compact size and looks nice.
5,Very good alarm clock,I have bought a few alarm clocks and this is the best one of all of them. It is easy to use and seems a little better quality. the cost was more than some but I would spend the few extra and get this
1,Light button clicks loudly,"There is one flaw on this clock which renders it useless. The light button, to check the time when it is dark, makes a loud click sound. If anyone else is asleep in the room, they can easily be woken up by this noise. I don't see anyone mentioning this, maybe I got a lemon? Item returned."
5,Finally Found the Right Clock,"Small, easy to use, even easier to read in the dark. Had bought and discarded others. This one is perfect."
3,Alarm turns off after awhile; not loud enough,"I bought this because people said it was so loud and it had really high reviews.But I am a heavy sleeper, and ""really loud"" is not how I would describe this at all. If you can wake to an alarm easily and want it in the same room, it will be great for you. But the alarm does turn off after a minute or so and if you're not the ""jumps out of bed immediately"" type you're going to want a different alarm or inevitably you'll sometimes sleep too late."
5,Good alarm clock,"This thing works great. Nice and simple and functional. Kinda stylish, too.A battery-powered alarm clock is the way to go. Just don't forget to buy batteries!Would buy again!"
2,Not Very Durable,It fell off of a desk (3 ft.) and the display would no longer show the correct time. Being as light weight as it was I would have thought it would survive it's first fall but I was wrong.
2,Disappointed,"The clock's alarm did not work correctly (and the light did not light) when it arrived. It seems there was a quality issue with the clock and I fixed it(at least, for now) by opening the clock and jiggling the wiring connections inside.The clock seemed like a good value for the price - it's nice looking and is a great size. The alarm is loud enough but a big drawback is that the alarm rings for 30 seconds or so and turns itself off. It's as though it clicks it's own snooze button (it will ring again, 4 minutes later). A good sleeper will sleep right through this, or at least, ignore the ringing."
5,Need a basic alarm clock? This is it.,"I agree with another reviewer's suggestion to read Weatherman's review. It is a complete description of this clock and how it works. Simple to set time and alarm. The time screen glows an easily readable, but not harsh, blue when you push the snooze bar in the dark. It only glows while you are pushing the bar - a battery saver. I always read the Amazon reviews, no matter what I am buying. Based on the reviews for many of these inexpensive clocks, this is the one I picked. I have been using it about a week and the clock and the alarm work well and the price was very reasonable. Good purchase."
4,"Perfect, simple, small","This is all we really need in a bedside clock and it doesn't glow at night so it doesn't disturb our sleep. We don't really use it as an alarm since cell phones take care of that problem now, but we do like to check the time once in awhile at night. This cute little clock takes up practically zero space on the nightstand, and it does what it's supposed to do."
3,Too loud,"Is working fine, I like the numbers are big and not , easy to set up but the alarm is too loud."
4,What the heck is the little transparent window for?,"This is a simple, basic little clock that's easy to set, and find in the dark. Oddly, there's a clear plastic ridged window set into the white base that seems to serve no function whatsoever, at least none that I can discover, and that makes me wonder if I am fully tapping the capabilities of this clock. It's not a light, the display is backlit. I like it, but may write the manufacturer and ask why they went to the extra trouble and expense."
4,fine,"I needed a small clock for my desk.It arrived early , it's the right size, and it works. Not much else to say."
3,small alarm clock,"Nice little clock but difficult to read both day and night. In both cases, you have to push the button to read it. Since my cat wakes me up (yes indeed), I have yet to use the alarm."
1,Diabetics Beware,"While type-II diabetics can benefit from a lower-fat and higher-protein diet, they should be very leery of following the advice in this book. The comments on insulin border on ludricrous as do the comments on an evolutionary diet. Does the author really believe that cavemen were healthy than we are? Does he believe that we should not pasteurize milk and cook meat?"
1,Food quackery at its worst,"The diet proposed by this book is founded on a totally unscientific assumption that a low-carbohydrate and high protien diet is healthful. He demonizes insulin, which is essential to cell nourishment and life itself. Weight loss using this diet is accomplished, as can be expected, by very low caloric intake. One should definitely take multivitamins in this diet to avoid malnourishment"
2,Huge highs and lows,"I started The Zone in August and didn't have much to lose--about 7 pounds. I lost it within a month and was thrilled. However, if I ever deviated SLIGHTLY from the Zone (i.e. a glass of wine without having protein with it) I would instantly gain five pounds. It was very stressful getting on the scale each morning. My weight has NEVER fluctuated this much.Also, I have gained back all the weight I lost and have been trying for one month to lose it again (being a PERFECT Zone student) and have had no success. I realize that MANY MANY people have had success on this diet and if you had asked me two months ago I would've given it five stars! But I really think the diet messed up my metabolism. Just a warning!"
1,Another Fad diet to avoid,"After ""Zoning"" for 6 months and initially losing weight and feeling good, I started feeling dizzy and very hungry all the time. My doctor said it was a result of my diet, and that it wasn't worth getting sick and ruining your health just to lose weight and try to look better. Since then I have educated myself a lot more. It may be necessary for some people to go through the Zone fad on their way to healthy living. But there is a huge amount of solid scientific literature pointing toward what the healthiest way to lose weight and keep it off is. I learned too late that this book had been debunked by everyone in the health and science community as being totally one man's theory with no science to support the conclusions. It's amazing that some ""experts"" profit off of unsuspecting people in this way."
1,"The Zone, Live Lecture Two- Tape Set","I feel ripped off. I feel like I just paided for some one to sell me something. If you are interested in getting this diet, Don't buy the tape. It doesn't give you the diet. It only sells you on the diet. Then you have to buy another book to get the diet."
1,Negative 5 stars,"Having dealt with Native American Inclusion in the Classroom, and being an Indigenous North American myself I found this DVD a complete stereotypical farce to say the least. I would not show this to children, and would only use it in a University setting to allow students to see the disgraceful way in which NDN's have been exploited in the electronic age. I personally doubt the ancestry and teachings of the people depicted in this film, did not hear or see anything to which would lead me to believe their ability to be teaching, and was completely offended by this show. It was a definite waste of time!"
1,Totally Unexpected.............,"After viewing this movie i was highly disappointed. I may be have been expecting too much from a Native American themed movie. I was more interested in the herbal remedies and treatment of ailments but the shamanistic healings and the ""occultish followers"" ruined the documentary and took the movie and a whole different direction. If you are looking for medicinal remedies or homeopathic healings this movie is not for you."
5,Beneficient Medicine,"I appreciate the video as an informative work of spiritual and natural significance. Two Birds is a wise man and it is nice to see him sharing without regard to race and cultural differences.Thank you,Chris"
1,Anglo wannnabes,"This DVD really is so terrible..... All the drumming and ceremonies are done by anglos that wanna be a Native American for what reason I do not know.... Leave Native American Medicine to the Native Americans....I enjoy some aspects of New Age philosophy, but to emulate other cultures is absurd.... Are they hoping to be ""Medicine Men/Women"" in an easy course? To all anglos, learn some western medicine, THEN study Native American and meld them together...Like the Dalai LLama once said.... Don't try to be Tibetan if you are not Tibetan....The disclaimer at the beginning says it all... Some Native Practitioners do not agree with what he is doing......For good reason...."
1,Beware,I guess someone has to be the guinea pig...Looks like it was shot on a phone. Actors who aren't actors. An incredibly stilted script. No direction. No lighting. Just a whole bunch of stay away.
4,GOOD DOCUMENTARY WITH GOOD REALISTIC SOLUTIONS,"This documentary initially discusses all the elements that cause people, especially Americans, to become obese. It provides a solution that should be obvious, but actually the solution presents a great contrast to how our society views exercise and diet. The documentary actually explores this contrast as well.Complete with case studies, scientific backing, and examples, this has to be one of the more complete approaches to not only losing weight, but also living healthy.I removed a star because of the title. It actually is your fault that you are fat. When I saw Gary Null in a seminar, that was the first thing he said when he discussed this documentary. However, I got a feeling that he regreted the title...in fact, all other Gary Null products are titled much better."
4,a good dvd for learning dance,"The backdrop and the instructors and wonderful. How beautiful the spirit of dance and mastery of those teaching in clear ways. Unfortunatly my floors and my weight made continually dancing in this way challenging to say the least for my poor knees. I danced for 6 years when I was younger and Hula was the finale of our dancing with the Bladettes I danced with.I love the style they are dancing which is a bit diferent from how I learned. Just watching is enjoyable though and one day when my weight is a bit more realistic for dance, I'll begin again and enjoy this relaxing and totally feminine type of dance and exercise for the spirit.Blessings,Susan Pharis"
3,i got it,"well it ok but its real easy!its stupid click back and see what think abot bellydancing it tones your body,makes you more flexible and if you do it longs enough you lose WEIGHT!"
3,Tight Fit,"Requires multiple attempts to get it aligned properly and it's difficult to be sure that the alignment is right. With good filter alignment, I can usually get several very smooth turns before it's secure. With this step-up adapter, there is very little threading, which allows for only about two turns, the same as you can get when a filter is in but not really aligned correctly. It's an understandable trade-off because more threading requires greater depth, which can mess up the focus and/or cause vignetting."
5,Pure remake heaven,"This is one excellent CD. From the remake of the overworld music, to the Cosmo Canyon, to the surprisingly well done remake of One Winged Angel, if you are a fan of any of the Final Fantasy piano collections this is NOT one to miss."
3,Easy on the ears,"I love Final Fantasy...and I probably love the music even more. This particular selection of arrangements is a little hit and miss though. Some tunes, like Aerith's Theme and the Main Theme, are quite magical. Others sadly, just don't really work as piano music e.g. Bombing Mission and J-E-N-O-V-A. The piano collections do get better.....FFVIII and FFX are just wonderful. But for the purposes of completing the collection, you could do worse than pick up FFVII while your at it!"
3,"Not good, Not too bad.",This definately isn't for all movie goers. As a fan of Bill Smith I was hoping it was better. As a drag racer I thought it was ok. Great Saturday afternoon movie. Don't expect action to pick up. I will say the Cars and photography are really good at certain points in the film.
1,"Review for ""Crimes of the Future'","""Crimes of the Future"" is the type of postmodernist ""artsy"" flick which considers meaningless ramblings, actions which could be cryptic messages disguised as purposeless events, and androgynous characters behind which a soundtrack of hoots, whistles, rustling, and static plays with interceptions of complete silence. This is degenerate art at its zenith and extremely surprising as coming from the same director who did ""Scanners,"" ""Videodrome,"" and ""Nightbreed."""
4,True Cronenberg Fans Package,Fast Company is an anomaly in David Cronenberg's filmography. Nowhere to be found is his underlying obsession with dark sexual psychology but instead this is a straightforward car flick. Don't expect Crash. A/V is excellent for this lost film.But the inclusion of his two early experimental films make this a must have for the Cronenberg fanatic.
3,B-movie,"I was glad they released this movie on DVD. I saw it years ago, and always wanted to get it.The plot is simple, the characters are flat and predictable, the explosions and fire stunts are cheap... but I LOVE Funny Cars, so I am definitely byas on this subject. The story sort of shows the lifestyle of the ""traveling circus"" in Drag racing at the time. Sure it was low budget, sure it is cheesy and exagerated at times, but I enjoyed it inmensely, and I'm glad I bought it.So: Don't expect award-winning material here, just sit back and enjoy it."
3,Not Worth The Money,"I was a little disappointed when using this software. I think someone can learn from it great no matter how good your Hebrew is. The software is not very user friendly however. As a beginner, I would like to be taken in steps through the different modules and exercises. With this software, you get some instructions on how to begin then you have to determine what to do next. This is probably good for someone who doesn't need to start with the basics, but if you're a beginner it'll take some poking around to figure out where you want to go. Also, you can tell the software developer spent a lot of time putting it together but it is not very professional as far as the look and navigation. A good product but not worth the money, in my opinion."
5,A good book for children,"When I was about seven years old, I read this book until the pages fell out. It's a very sweet story about a mouse named Vanessa who overcomes her shyness. The illustrations are very nice."
2,Pretty but not functional,"First off it is very hard to read because of the glare and distortion given off by the plastice houseing. Mine was 14 degrees off (high) as far as being accurate. I disassembled it and fixed it. If yours is the same be careful I cracked the plastic housing. Cheap made in China, what do you expect, not because I cracked the housing but how inaccurate it was."
1,"Cheaply made, inaccurate, and short-lived","This thermometer wasn't accurate when it worked, and now it's stuck at 70 degrees, though it's winter in the northeast. The manufacturer says it's out of warranty and won't replace. Save your money."
1,A constant temperature year round,"The thermometer arrived and was stuck somewhere around 95 degrees, so it was returned. Maybe others work, but it wasn't worth the effort for me."
1,Reads 12 degrees high in cold weather,Very poor. Looks nice but only accurate when temps range above 60 degrees. Placed in snow bank on sunless cold day and reading showed 40 degrees. Accurate second thermometer showed 28 degrees at the same time. Not much good if you are relying on it to get the day started right -- snow should been melting if it was even close to reading accurately.
1,Total junk,Bought the same one at LOWES $12 Broke in three days Took back.Would not buy.Total China ripoff. Gets worse Year.
2,Sent wrong thermometer.,They sent the wrong thermometer. The one I received has moom and star on it. Not worth sending back. The tube is plastic and not glass.
4,Copper Thermometer,My wife checks the thermometer outside her kitchen window and is up to day with the temperature. Has a stylist look.
1,Chaney Instrument,This thermometer looks nice and worked for about two months before it quit working in our 120` summer heat.I would not recommend it for hot climates.
1,Worked ONCE.,"This worked very well - the first time I used it.I hand washed it afterwards, then used it today, about two weeks after I bought it. I poured hot coffee into it, and the outside of the thermos has become almost too hot to touch. It is obvious that the vacuum seal has broken and lost all its insulating properties.I thought the Thermos brand meant quality, but I guess this is what I get for buying a cheapened product from WalMart. I don't recommend this product."
1,Worked for a short while,"I bought mine at Walmart and it worked for a few months--then suddenly, not at all. I don't know what happened, but what a rip off."
1,Doesn't keep things hot,"I may have just have gotten a bad one, but the one I recently purchased does not keep things hot. I have poured freshly made steaming hot coffee into the Thermocafe multiple times and within an hour it is barely warm. Since the job of the thermos is to keep things hot, I am considering this to be a complete product failure."
3,bad and good,"First I'll start with the good. Does a fairly good job of keeping items hot/cool. Doesn't use a glass liner for insulation, which makes it relatively rugged and won't shatter if you drop it from a couple inches. Relatively handsome looking product. Using a carafe-type screw on lid allows fairly easy and clean pouring into a cup.Now the bad. The lid is made from two pieces, the ""base"" of which is oddly constructed with gaps and crannies. That allows a fair amount of liquid to escape - enough to stain clothing and/or upholstery, not enough to completely soak through something. Those afforementioned nooks and crannies are very hard to keep clean, and will very easily allow nasties to fester if you aren't quite dilligent about it (which basically requires either a pipe cleaner or a spin through the dishwasher to get completely clean).All in all, a good concept but still needs some work."
4,Brilliant,It wil open your mind and your eyes to a whole new world. The concepts in this book is what modern philosophy is based on! It is as painful as a root canal to read but if you can read a fully comprehend the concepts you have achived more than you can ever imagine. I was truly blown away!
4,Vewy Fwench.,"This is a wonderful collection of the music of Paul Dukas. The disc opens with a spectacularly simple brass fanfare which launches us into the dreamy La Peri ballet. The orchestration and organic development of melody are on par with Debussy. It is exceedingly enjoyable. Then, the Sorcerer's Apprentice comes on. Even though this piece usually appears at children's concerts, it really is a powerfully written and well crafted tone-poem. Telarc captures the orchestral effects stunningly. Allow yourself to re-discover it within the context of Dukas' craftsmanship. The program ends with the Symphony is C. It is full of color, bright rhythms and delightful orchestration. Imagine Debussy without the mist - that's Dukas. This disc will grow on you. Do not hesitate to experience it."
4,New home netrwork,"I just bought a NETGEAR RP614 router to share the ADSL connection to the Internet between several PC's. Two years ago I had purchased one of the wireless products and had extremely slow transfer rates. I have decided to upgrade to a real ""wired"" network. Now with the new router I am contemplating all the Ethernet wiring that will be needed and it wont be a trivial task. But I just read those articles about using the existing power lines and the Netgear Powerline Ethernet Adapter (XE602) seems to be the solution. So thanks for all the info."

1,Towel fell apart first wash,I received this as a shower gift and put it through the laundry in preparation of using it on my newborn and the seam completely came apart... very POOR quality...
3,"Very Cute, but average towel","This towel, and others from the Koala Baby line, are adorable. They do what they are supposed to do, which is dry the baby. However, and I've found this with all other Koala Baby towels I've received, the stitching around the hood isn't the best. After washing them the first couple of times the trim begins to come off the towel. However, this can be remedied with a couple of quick stitches. I've found that the Carters towels I've received are much more durable."
2,Not pleased,The cute octopus came apart the first time I washed it. It also ripped along the seams of the hood. I fixed it myself and use it because it is a decent size and thicker than my other hooded towels.
4,so cute!,the octopus is so cute! though it covers my baby's face... but i love the towel all in all! i wash it every week and its still in good shape! i just don't use the wash cloth coz i think its too hard or too thick...
2,Hood came apart after several washings,I got the towel at my shower and liked the thickness of the material. The hood started to come apart from the towel only after a couple of washings. I ended up buying other koala baby towels w/o the hood since they are a lot thicker than other towels for babies.
2,Mask cant compete movie,It's an okay show but is shocking compared to the movie and even to mask 2(son of the movie.Good family movie if you are sick.
4,Mallory or Malory? Mrs. WHO Investigates?,"I am new to Hazel Holt and delighted with the writing and especially with Mrs. Mallory.I used two l's because I have the 1989 release where the cover, title page, andCIP all use Mrs. Mallory with two l's. BUT throughout this book, Mallory has just one l.I see later editions use one l. Is that because the misspelling was missed in the originalSt. Martin's Press edition of the book?"
3,A low level introduction,"This book disappointed me - it is written at such a low technical level, with virtually no math. An opportunity squandered."
3,Anchor Pendant,"The pendant is not 1 7/16"" as described. It is 7/8"". In other words, it is about half the size I expected."
2,Extremely small,These are the smallest travel jars I have ever seen. I bought them for my daughter's birthday party because they wanted to make their own lip gloss. These jars are so small it is hard to even hold them and screw the tops on and off. They constantly dropped them over and over again. One dollar a piece for the jars is very high for such a tiny jar. The description should include dimensions.
4,Japonesque Mini Travel Jar,Japonesque Mini Travel Jar are indeed small. was hoping they where made out of glass... not a big fan of plastic and what not. they do work good.
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"These jars are exactly what I wanted. I sometimes mix my bare minerals loose eyeshadows and these are the perfect jars for that. They are maybe half the size of the bare minerals jars, otherwise it is a very similar jar. The clear base makes it easy to see the color inside. The size is perfect to dip a brush in, it would be awkward to put my finger in.My items were delivered in just four days. I bought five and they came nicely packaged with a lunch sized reusable bag.I originaly purchases [[ASIN:B000VDAE7K Fantasea 3/4 oz. Acrylic Jar], ]this was a nice jar too (very usable but the clear base has a slight blue cast) but as it was at least twice the size of the bare minerals jars- and not what I wanted I am glad I only got one."
3,Smaller than picture,This is much smaller than it looks in the picture. I thought it would be about 3 inches in diameter but it was only about 1 inch. I was shocked when it arrived. Dimensions should be included. They did send me a small free bag.
3,"Ohmann is a genius, though this is not his best book.","Some critics consider this to be Ohmann's best work, which is odd...a little like praising Isaac Newton for his religious writings rather than gravity or calculus. Richard Ohmann is the genius who wrote ""Shaw, the Style and the Man."" This landmark book contains a new method for analysing style (all style, not just Shaw's) which lends itself to immediate application in the teaching of composition and rhetoric. The Shaw book is an exciting and useful book, not the usual academic cant. Every teacher of english should commit murder if necessary to acquire it."
3,Train Set,"Although this product is a wonderful learning toy for any child, when purchased, the title, photograph, and all reviews indicated ""Transportation City Train Set & Table"" We were thrilled to be getting the table with this. Since this purchase, the descriptions all now say ""table not included"" If those 3 small words were there in the first place, it would not have been a problem. When this set is purchased, most people will have to buy a table which costs the same, if not more than the actual set itself. Our 2 year old granddaughter loves this set and enjoys hours of creative fun."
5,Great story line. I'd like to see more of this authors work,The story was well developed and the adventure was steady and exciting. There were certain parts like the SANDTIME BOX AND THE JOURNEY DOOR that really impressed me with such great imagination. All and all I liked the book and would like to see the sequel ASAP.
4,"Readers rejoice, a new fantasy author has emerged.","Fantasy readers rejoice. A new author is presenting her talented writings to the world. K.L. Morgan's book ""Castledance"" is filled with the ingredients you love in fantasy. There is a young hero, Wit Stron (a delf, not elf) who chances upon a hidden fortress. Evil forces are at play, and peace on Furth may not last much longer. ""Castledance"" is populated with elves, delves, trolls, gnomes, undants and humans. Good and evil are again at odds, wizzardry and spells are everywhere. The characters are well developed, the action is exciting, and the book reads well. Let the fantasy of ""Castledance"" carry you away to the lands of Delflia and beyond."
3,Good Product with really bad technical support,"This is a great product for the small business owner. Great features for the small contractor to keep everything in line. There is a learning curve for sure. Intuit is one of these profit driven mega companies that have taken their tech support to India and Pakistan. Be prepared to deal with rude ""by the book"" people who can barely speak english. Be prepared to re-read your instruction manuel because these folks are of little help in any. 30 Day free Tech support is a Joke!"
3,hard to use,"I have used Quicken for many years and have found it to be so easy to use so when we opened a new contracting business I turned to Intuit. This software claims to be geared toward contractors and easy to set up. It somewhat meets the first claim but after working with the software for about 4 weeks now, I still don't have the first transaction entered and would return it if I could!"
5,Love Tervis!,"These tumblers are beautiful....very festive and vibrant. I love Tervis tumblers. They are durable, dishwasher safe, don't sweat and look great year after year."
4,Convenient and Easy. Good Product.,"I like this lazy susan. The marble surface is smooth, non-porous, and gives an overall exquisite look and feel. It is easy and very convenient to use when frosting cakes, etc. A good size for easy storage and it is also very presentable on the dinner table."
4,"Excellent, unbiased historical summary","I cannot promote this book more. Rodinson explores the prophet's life from birth to death, in an un-biased, open-minded manner. Translation: she explores everything, the unsavory moments, to the acts of ultimate courage and commitment."
3,Has many drills for a wrestling team.,"This book is very resourceful for a wrestling coach. If you are looking for a book on wrestling moves, this is not the book for you. This book is practically useless unless you are a wrestling coach."
1,Wrestling drill book,Not what I expected very diappointed. I have been coaching for 15 years and was hoping it would give me a fresh approach but did not . Save your money. Brad Berrier
5,xevoZ!!!,"I can't say it enough times - I love this toy line - these guys are so cool and customizible, The wave to figures are just strating to come out, and hasbro is improving the line with each figure! I've seen the wave 3 figures and they blow everything out of the water - I can't want till amazon gets the rest of the new figures!"
5,This toy is cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought this toy was great because you can build your own xevoz when you collect then you can battle with your friends and see whos xevoz is the most powerful!!!!!!!!But the only thing bad about is the price.
2,Poorly Written Art Lessons,"Each chapter reflects a certain aspect of painting. The steps involved were sketchy, unclear and jumbled. Some of the paintings used to make a point did not illustrate what the instructor was trying to show.The one aspect that was repeated and clearly written was stating how talented Ballestar is."
4,Were is Breastford? I want to be there.,Breasts go wild in the town of Breastford. If you saw the Withes of Breastwick you can see several items and the house that was used in Breastwick movies. I would like to know how the male charactor could have sex with so many women. This is a fun movie with lots of sex and fun. The plot is not great but who cares. I think that you will enjoy it.
2,mediocre,"The girls are hot but story is extra corny (no surprise) but beware, the softcore! This is probably more for couples with wife being uptight about porn, I guess.."
4,You want a story? What?,"I would call this soft porn if there had been any sex in this film. Mostly female nudity, while in hot tubs or in the bathtub. As for a plot - well, the woman of the town are brainwashed to be sex slaves. Really, did you want anything more complex than that? Why waste film time with plot. This is about nudity and lots of it. Too bad some of the girls look better dressed than when naked."
1,Not worth it,"This didn't come with the promised insert, the inserts I bought don't fit well (the holes are just slightly in the wrong spot and don't slide well on the rings) and so while it's not that expensive, it's still kind of silly. I don't know if I'll bother to use this, but it doesn't seem like it would stand up that well to much use."
2,No not fort me,"I didn't like this book. The Author talked down to the reader like we really are idiots. Maybe we are for buying this book. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but, he's tring to tell us how to write a novel because he's written a dozen. Really? Yeah he did but THERE ARE ALL OUT OF PRINT!! Hello?!! anyone home!? Ussually out of print means no one read them. After trying to read this I can understand why."
5,Very enriching,"I loved Monteleone's book on writing a novel, and I am making it required reading for a creative writing class which I teach. Mr. Monteleone has taken a difficult subject and made it simple, yet enriching. This is no easy task. I have also read several of Monteleone's novels and find his thriller ""Blood of the Lamb"" one of my favorite books."
2,Same old story,"This is yet another cookie cutter writing book. Very little in this volume was new to me and the author's attitude toward certain types of writing, such as contemporary literary fiction, was more than a little insulting. Perhaps he can include a chapter called ""Don't Insult Your Readers"" in the next edition.If you've never read a writing book before, this one has some practical advice in it, but you can get this type of information elsewhere."
1,Not worth it!,"The entire book could be summarized in a onepage bulleted list.This ""author"" spends more time bragging about himself than encouraging the new novelist. I would go so far as to say that this book will probably discourage more people than not from writing.I can't believe I wasted my time reading it. It's hard to believe this book was actually published. Ironically, the fact that this uninspiring book is in print should give hope to the readers that were beaten down by the weight of this guy's portly attitutde."
1,Writer needs a better editor!,"Standard stuff so far - Info you can find in any of the other books on the subject. I am still trying to get through this book however. It's very hard - Terribly edited, grammar mistakes on every page just about. If I was Tom, I'd be very embarrassed..."
3,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing a Novel,"This book is good for someone making a start in novel writing but mostly if you are intested in writing 'genre'. Most of the book seems to focus on thriller, action type of writing and isn't in my opinion much help if you are planning to write a more literary book. In addition it would've been helpful if the book had included some examples of what is good fiction compared to not so good. For example, the book tells you the elements of what makes a good opening, but some examples of good openings and why they are good would've been really helpful."
4,GREAT BOOK,"In no time at all I finished this book. It was very easy to understand and the throughly informational, especially since I'm in the process of writing my first book. I read the book after already starting my novel and it was good I did. It showed me errors that I was constantly falling into and also gave me a great many tips for the furthing of my book."
5,"If you are serious about being published, pay attention...","I read the reviews and opinions offered on the validity of this guide and I can say only this... Tom Monteleone knows what he is talking about. In a powerful presentation, both from the point of view of a successful novelist and the culmination of years of practical knowledge properly applied to his own and the careers of others, this book is invaluable. I fall into the category of the ""others"". I have followed Tom's advice and through hard work, I have published my first hardcover novel, released this fall, 2004. I can only encourage the serious writers out there. If you want to create a writing career, Tom's Idiot's Guide is the light to help guide you down the dark paths of the publishing world. Fellow writers buy this book and start walking."
3,A Good Beginner's Guide for Genre Writing,"Tom Monteleone is the real deal, having published over 25 horror, thriller, and science fiction novels in the course of his career. Please note that this book mainly tackles popular fiction (aka ""genre"" fiction, such as thriller, horror, and romance) while laying the smackdown on ""literary"" fiction (the type of fiction fawned over in English departments). Since genre fiction makes up the large majority of fiction published at this time in the United States, it's not a bad stance for the book to take.This book, like most ""Idiots"" books, provides a decent introduction to its subject for newbies. Unfortunately, Monteleone tackles too many subjects to provide any good information for anyone besides beginners. For beginners= 4 stars. For intermediate or advanced writers looking for help= 2 stars."
2,Too disorganized and too preachy,"While there is some benefit to hearing someone else's account of their recovery, or healing in the author's case, there are two problems with the book that kept it from being really good. First, it is not organized well and she jumps from cursory discussions of anti-depressants to stories about her husband to little bits about what she actually did to get better. Second, while she begins the book by saying that she is Christian but many religions coexist in our society, the bottom line to the book is if you don't believe if Jesus, you can forget recovery. I found this disappointing and shortsighted."
3,Beauty is pain,"I have come to the realization that these are not the kind of boots you wear outside. They look stunning, really. They must be for strutting around at home. They are tall and tight, so tall I couldn't quite tippy toe high enough and so tight that the top of my foot hurt. But they are fantastic. Between the tallness and the tightness I looked even sillier walking in very tall shoes than I usually do. But I adore them. Sadly sending them back.Did I mention they were 'way too tight? Not a medium width, unless you mean narrow when you say medium."
5,"A Gold Mine of Trivia, Facts and More!","I've been a L&H fan since I was 6 and still am. The ""boys"" have been making us laugh in television re-runs, video and DVD but die hard fans are probably wondering what was the story behind the merriment? Here we have a GOLD MINE of trivia, facts and much more. Included are biographies of the pickle faced Jimmy Finlayson, Leo McCarey (who directed many of the later films) re-occuring themes, ""the wives"" music like ""The Cuckoos"" even comments on props like the bowler hats that Stan and Ollie wore. So sit back, relax and enjoy the world of two of the most talented comedians to grace the silver screen."
4,Leave 'em laughing,"Having recently acquired the Hal Roach L&H films on DVD, I've found this an excellent companion volume, particularly valuable for its entries on miscellaneous topics to do with the boys. One highlight was learning that Edgar Kennedy lets out a four-letter expletive in ""The Perfect Day,"" not noticed by the censors or anyone else for decades. While this well-written book provides up-to-date technical information about the releases and formats of the individual films over the years, I would've liked more critical analysis. A minor disappointment is that no photos date from the classic Roach years."
5,dec 8 2008 2 nd ed????????,It says 2nd ed dec 8th so how come this is not a pre order item?????which one do you get now??
3,Great Disappointment,"I grew up thinking I was his #1 fan. After meeting him, reading the book, and briefly working with him, I found that I was at best a VERY distant second to Stan Freberg in that category.Though funny and giving me some things in hard copy I'd never had before, I found the book self-serving right up to and including the most abrupt ending that allows him to sell another book.I read this book while walking around San Francisco right after it came out. I was disappointed by his grandiosity then and the book and personal contact left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
3,It was okay,I felt that it went light on his mistakes. Almost like the show tried to glass over his downfalls and highlight his good points. I think he was portrayed as a better president than he really was.
5,Excellent Portrait,"If the absorbing American Experience documentary ""Clinton"" were a book, people would rush directly to the index and look up ""Monica Lewinsky"" and ""sex scandal,"" which does, indeed, encompass a considerable portion of this two-part production. In its wider context, though, Bill Clinton's private peccadilloes occupy no more or less space than warranted given the pivotal role they played in diluting his presidency. Ultimately, writer-director-producer Barak Goodman has captured the essence of the man: A political natural whose uncontrolled appetites were, ultimately, as defining as his gifts."
5,very worthwhile,"While my hearth broke all over again, this was a captivating look at Bill Clinton. A great president, a brilliant mind and a flawed man. I urge everyone to see this."
4,through,"I'm assuming that this is basically the same book as Frank Buchman: a life by the same author which is out of print. It's a very through and well researched book about the life of a remarkable man, gives one a different world view from the late twenties right up to the sixties and explains what a life of faith really means. Could have been a little more critical but still a very intresting book, not a typical christian read."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book extremely disappointing. The author takes a narrow view of how an individual firm can improve its competitive position by 'playing the environmental card'. Although he cites von Weisäcker et al: Factor Four, he does not seem to be aware of the literature that takes a much more systemic view of how to reconcile ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and commercial success. The book is perhaps useful in that it vividly demonstrates the limitations of a perspective that is centered on the individual corporation and its immediate competitive advantage with a rather blinkered view both of the scope for innovation and the wider macroeconomic framework within which business operates."
5,This Book Changed My Life,"Success Within has given me the confidence to try things in life that I never had the courage to do before, and I am loving every minute of it! Thanks to Success Within I bounce through my days radiating cheer and it works! People really are more responsive to you when you are a positive force. Every day I try to do one of the activities and I have met many wonderful new friends through my efforts, and my self esteem and confidence in myself has skyrocketed. I am presenting this book as an activity for my women's group to do and I cannot wait to begin. I can only say that Success Within is a MUST READ! Get it today!"
4,Very good movie,It's a very good movie. My favorite part was when Eliza was rescuing the elephants. She used her heart to rescue them. I would watch the movie again.
2,Hit or miss,"I have had good luck with many homeopathic remedies, but this one didn't do much for me, or perform consistently. D-Limonene is much more effective at controlling my GERD, and cheaper over the long run."
4,"Cozy, Around the House Socks","I don't wear socks often, except for around the house. My last socks wore out quickly on the bottom and got holes. However, these seem durable and are really soft. I recommend these socks."
3,OK socks,I have bought gold toe socks before at the store and really liked them. I could not find them again at that store so I went online. The socks online - they fit good but when washed tend to loose their shape.
5,My 10-year-old daughter loves these socks,"My daughter is very fussy about her clothes feel, and especially socks. If the feels seams, ridges or lumps she gets very upset and refuses to wear them. These socks are perfect for her as they have a smooth clean feel, fit well and are warm and comfortable. Recommended."
5,great socks,These socks really cushion the bottom of my feet. I had been looking for a thicker sock to ease my tired feet after standing all day at work. These are perfect and I will definetly purchase more .
5,small feet will love these,"I have always had the experience of buying black socks for work that don't fit. I am a size 7 and hated overtime with oversized socks being only part of the problem for the second half of a 16 hr work day, These fit great, haven't washed them yet so can't tell you about anything else but I love these and will be buying again."
5,"Gift, ordering more!","These were part of a gift and when they arrived, I thought they were so nice, I am going to order some for myself!"
2,Very Disappointed; Not Classic Gold Toe Quality,"Bought these, hoping for classic gold toe quality (nice heft, thick cotton cushioning, long life).Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed. While these are a slight step up from cheapie Hanes socks from the big box store, these are NOT the same quality we used to get from Gold Toe.The six pair I bought shrunk, pilled like mad (bits of cotton sluffed off inside the sock after every wash) and they all developed holes within 3 months of wear. No, I don't use bleach. They simply were not made of very high quality cotton and wore through at the friction point at the ball of each foot.I won't buy Gold Toe socks again until I hear that they've returned to their classic standard.Why, oh why, can't women get the same high quality socks that men can buy so easily? I hope Gold Toe reads the mail and improves their manufacturing standard. Until then, I opt out."
2,Not the same socks,"I have worn the Women's Gold Toe Crew Socks for many years. The page I ordered the socks on stated I had ordered this item a little more than a year ago. The socks seem to be made from the same material, but are about 2-3"" shorter when placed on top of one of my older pair. I wear a size 7 1/2 shoe, and the socks are too small to be comfortable."
2,The Quality is Slipping,"I've worn Gold Toe crew socks for years, and was always confident that I was getting a quality sock. They were comfortable, fairly thick and they wore well.Recently I purchased 6 pair of Gold Toe crews here, and I'm extremely disappointed. They fabric is so light weight, I don't think these socks will last 3 months. The seam in the toe is kind of funny, too, and it bunches up on the sides making the socks a little uncomfortable sometimes.I'll be looking for a heavier, sturdier alternative for my next crew sock purchase."
4,"Gold toe sock, feel great",These socks are very comfortable and fit perfect. Not to thin like summer socks and not to thick like winter socks.
1,Got a hole right away and return is a hassle,"A sock got a hole in it during the very first wearing. I asked the company to send me one sock and I would be happy; however, they required I return all 6 socks for exchange. By that time some of the socks were in the laundry, and the price of the envelope in which to return the socks was greater than the value of the one sock, not to mention the hassle of returning them. Anyway, from now on, I'll be picking up a package of Hanes at WalMart."
4,white socks for winter,Good fit in the foot area but would like the socks to reach a couple inches longer in the leg portion. Nice material.
2,Shrink and Deform after Washing,"Liked these socks until I washed them. After washing in warm water and drying, the toes area is deformed and the size looks like for a kid. Im not sure that I can even get my foot in anymore (Im a size 8.5). Im kind of surprised since Gold Toe is usually such a great product and I have used others in the past w/o any of these issues."
5,Gold Toe Socks for Women,"We have used Gold Toe socks for years. If you want quality this is the sock you should purchase and this is the place you should purchase them from. Great price, fast shipping and good communications. RECOMMEND!"
3,gold toe socks,"Very comfortable socks, but I like my socks much longer. They are to short. Not as thick as men's gold toe socks. They will do."
2,The size runs small,"I love the style and extra padding in the sole; was hopeful these were the answer to tender feet in need of comfort, but, sadly, the size of the socks are, disappointingly, small. Not only do I wish for more length from heel to toe, and more length in the top section, but, more importantly, I wish the top section didn't choke my ankle with it's tight, little band restricting blood flow. I don't have large feet; socks sized 9-11 are the standard size I wear. With these, I had to double-check the package to make certain I hadn't gotten children's socks by mistake -- they aren't, but I'll likely be giving these to my 10-year-old grandniece, anyway.....BOTH packages."
2,"Strong, but not very soft","These socks appear to be very strong. They have reinforced toes and heels. A little disappointed though because they are not very soft, and they do not stretch much at all. If your feet tend to swell, they will get tight. I feel like I had to choose between socks that would wear a long time, vs socks that are soft and comfortable."
4,"A good fitting sock, but not enough padding in","A good fitting sock that looks durable, but not enough padding in the foot for the amount of walking I do. Will have to pass them on to someone else."
4,My favorite socks!,"These are my favorite socks, I've now purchased another pack since my initial order. They stay up well, are warm, and are a good height. Plus the gold toe makes it easy to match them up. Love them!"
3,disappointed,Where are the Goldtoe socks of last year that had a knit arch support? These are a poor second choice. I might as well get cheaper socks at WalMart.
3,Comfort but not sturdy,"very thick and comfort but it's very easy to get small hole on it. plus, it keeps dropping small fabric pieces."
1,What happened to Gold Toe socks?,They used to be the best brand. I have worn them for years. I have twice ordered a women's crew sock but they are so narrow I can't get them on. I wear a size 10C which is not considered to be very wide. I have a dozen or more brand new GoldToe socks I can't wear. Be very careful ordering Gold Toe socks now.
5,Perfect,These socks are exactly what I was looking for. They fit great. They do not slide down like some of the other socks i have bought before.
5,Great socks,I love love love these socks. They are comfortable and warm. I like the stretchy top but yet they fit snugly and don't fall down. I will buy more. Thanks.
3,crew socks,"The socks are tight and the toes are not smooth, but they are soft inside. I will not order them again. They're not good for me."
3,"So far okay, but men's gold toe socks a big disappointment","So far the women's gold toe socks have been fine. I almost didn't try them after my husband complained that his gold toe socks, that were fairly new, were wearing out on the heel. He had to throw out 3 pairs in a very short period of time."
3,Fake free shipping,"These are probably fine socks, but when I tried to order them, although they were labeled as eligible for free super saver shipping, that status disappeared in the order process and an ample shipping charge was added. I hate paying for shipping, so deleted these socks from my order. There are others that do actually qualify for free shipping."
2,Speculations that do not benefit Christianity Islam Judaism or Zoroastrism,"His grasp of logical conclusions is as weak as his grasp of the itinerary.He was lucky he wasn't robbed and/or jailed. He puts more credence in any local fable over any 1st century documentation. His basic motive seems to be telling a tale with irreverence for any faith - something that sells, though he has to use two different title to even do that.The only reason I give it higher than a one is that it does give a view of Iran/Irac/Syria that most people would not be able to read about.It is a shame of our times that the area is too dangerous for the people who could properly understand what he encountered - and look beyond the narrow vision of Polo.The birth has not been adequately explained in any book yet, but is it worth buying the tale of one who believes the Magi were out to rescue Jesus when even the other information he gives detracts from that hypothesis?"
3,Not exactly inspirational,"""You can't judge a book by its cover,"" they say. That's certainly true of this book. The cover would lead you to expect a rather inspirational story about the historical background of the Magi. But you need a fairly strong stomache for scatalogical humor to get through this book. Unpleasant, to say the least! True, the author has a point to make. Too bad he couldn't take the time to write it up in a coherant, scholarly fashion, with facts that could be checked. Instead, he mingles travelogue, humor, dirty jokes, and ideas together in a nasty stew that implies a lot but cannot be refuted because he is not willing to clean up his research and make it presentable."
1,Journey to Babel,"When I picked up this book I thought the premise sounded intriguing: a researcher retraces the steps of the Wise Men from Persia to Bethlehem, and then writes a book to tell us who they really were. After reading the book, however, I am not certain whether the author actually intends to be taken seriously. His work is a mishmash, alternating between a hilariously profane account of his journey and his philosophical musings about the descent of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam from Zoroastrianism. The result is something resembling ""Chariots of the Gods"" or one of those books about how the Ark of the Covenant is now secreted away somewhere in Ethiopia, hidden by the Knights Templar and their descendants the Masons. It is hard to give much credence to any of this, and one is tempted to suspect that Roberts is offering it with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. Do your Christmas reading elsewhere."
2,only looks nice,"It looks fantastic but it is the only feature. When I opened the package, it showed that the temperature was between 68-72. After that it never changes! Even I put it in the fridge for two minutes, nothing happened at all. I am sure my refrigerator works well, so I just returned it. By the way, the service of Amazon.com is excellent."
1,oops,"I bought this cd cause I saw Zezo on youtube. He was playing solo guitar very impressively but this cd is awful. It sounds like Kenny G. Maybe some people will like it but if you're looking for hauntingly beautiful guitar music, avoid this one like the plague."
1,Who IS John Byrne anyway?!,"Those that can DO - those that can't TEACH.John Byrne's book on comedy is a joke - a self-described ""successful"" comedian no UK stand-up fans have ever seen or heard perform thinks he has the right to teach comedy. Byrne has never performed on British TV, you never see his name headlining major comedy clubs, nor on the writing credits of a succesful tv sitcom. Yet he believes he can teach how to be a success at all of these.And the book's contents? Well if you think you can become a successful comedian using dated techniques like puns and malaprops, good luck to you. But don't expect to be headlining the Comedy Store thanks to anything you'll read in this dated, irrelvant and misleading travesty of a book."
3,Not a full lenght movie,"The title alone is misleading. I believed that this was a movie and not just some of the Tv stories.As for Noddy, the children still enjoy it!Being so simple, the book is not as simple to read to the child, and a little one losses interest fast. I enjoyed it more."
2,Silly,I thought this book was rather boring. All of these authors are very good writters and I was disapointed in this book. It's not a keeper.
1,Stupid,I would go further than the other reviewer and call it stupid. Not much substance and poor story lines.
1,I will give it a 5 for compromise,"A rehash of Ross's theology just repackaged the same compromised views he has been teaching for years. It is the same compromise, the same twisting of scripture, the same highbrow attitude. All that to save face with the men of the world."
3,Objective look at old earth vs. young earth science,"This book is primarily written for and to young Earth Christians. Dr. Ross provides evidence for the ancient age of the Earth and the universe. Starting out, this book looks at the cause of why most Christians believe that the Earth is only thousands of years old. He then goes on to apologetically convince the reader of the fallacies of this belief. Although it is written for a Christian audience, this book could provide some witnessing power for those trying to reach the largely un-Christian scientific community. If you would like to stir some debate in your Church, take a look at this book, it will provide you with the opportunity. It is also written in a non-scientific method so it shouldn't confuse many readers."
1,"Simply erroneous, though well-intended",This unfortunate book only succeeds in defending the 'science' theories of predominantly unsaved men while downgrading the Holy Bible in the process.Beware whenever an author attempts to synthesize or integrate the Bible with anything else. You end up with a mixture of iron and clay that collapses under its own tottering weight.Here the alloy of Genesis and astrophysic-geologic-genetic- evolutionic hypotheses does violence to both sides of the equation.GENESIS vs. sciencism. They are not equivalent or alloyable.
5,Confidence in Old Earth,"I have for years believed in an old earth, that God is not a deciever. Not wanting to create a controversy, I have always kept quiet about this among my Christian family where the central thought is a young earth. I believed it was not a major issue to cause conflict. Not only did Hugh Ross confirm my own rational and studies, he also offered additional evidence of an old earth. Further, he shows reasoning why this issue needs to be resolved if Christianity is to have credibility."
1,MCAT Verbal Reasoning Review,"The book specifically test #2 is filled with errors. There are duplicate question numbers, skipped answer numbers, and some of the answers are flat out incorrect. It makes it very frustrating when attemping to study."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This book is a waste of money. There are many errors in it which makes studying very difficult and frustrating. The questions also appear easier than those on actual MCAT practice tests, which gives you an inaccurate self-evaluation. Do not purchase this book--you will wish you didn't!"
3,Not just for wannabe doctors,"There are a lot of practice passages - about 36. The answers are generally explained quite well and in detail but the book has a lot of errors such as answers being wrongly numbered. I also thought some of the answers were just plain wrong. But it is not easy to find material that is hard enough to practise for entry into difficult professions. These examples are hard enough. (In fact, I'm more impressed with doctors' brains than I was before!) I thought it was challenging and useful though I did skip the science based passages because I was using it to tutor someone who wanted to be a pilot not a doctor. I searched the web for suitable material; it was surprisingly difficult to find much aimed at this level. So I recommend this one to you. It is one of three books that I bought. (The Columbia Review MCAT Verbal Reasoning Powerbuilder by Stephen D Bresnick and William H Bresnick was also useful). My student got through. What more can I say?"
3,Very pretty artwork but not worth the money.,"Lovely colorful illustrations, but pop-ups aren't throughout, only a couple; content ok, but for older child. Total package -- nothing I was inspired enough by to purchase"
5,A New Refreshing Sound,"I have recently bought her cd, and it is wonderful!!! Her sound is amazing! her voice is rich and smooth. i heard her winning entry for a Tonos contest and i knew i wanted her cd when it came out. her style is different from most of today's artists. it is truely unique and uplifting. my favorite song on her cd is the same side of the moon. her lyrics are poetic and it flows evenly, unlike some songs today which have quirks and many rhythm flaws. her songs make me feel happy to be alive and raises my spirits. Corrinne May's music is inspiring to the heart and soul. It is now my new favorite cd. What i do hope is that other people will get to know her music and enjoy her talent which she has shared with us."
4,Interesting Refreshment,"This CD is just a little different to stand on its own. Take a clean well balance emotional female singer with great range, add some lite jazz & pop hooks to some unique modal changes, play with mostly guitar or piano backup, & wrap within great sound production. The only thing missing is the lyrics. Sometimes you can guess what the next word will be & some songs come close to Christian Pop Rock because of the subject matter (Is she singing about God, humanity, or a boyfriend/lover in most of the songs?), but don't worry, this CD is way above that style.Are you tired of all the gloom & doom of modern Pop? Do you want something refreshing? Do you want to smile as you drive down the freeway? Give this CD a spin to clear the air."
3,Not firm support,"It was mentioned is a previous review that this item had firm support which was a selling point for me. I found the exact oppisite to be true. Its really nothing more than a long-line pair of pantyhose. Its very comfortable and long enough,being that I am a tall plus-size girl. I have no issues with the bra portion I do just wish the support was much firmer."
1,A Spurious Account of Noah's Flood,"There has been a trend with some biographers to place themselves - or another invented character - within the events of their biography. I never thought anyone would do this to a Biblical account. When I read about this book before purchasing, I assumed the ""grandchild"" of Noah would be telling her story based upon the stories from her Grandfather. Instead the author invented a grandchild who was actually on the Ark in addition to Noah, his wife, his three sons and their wives. This places the Biblical Noah's flood account in the category of fairy tales! There are enough lies in this world without inventing another one!The art is really creative and appropriate. It is unfortunate that the content is a slur on the Biblical record of the event. If you are looking for true Biblical accounts for children, do not buy this book!"
1,content,"This book has wonderful illustrations but the content is presented strictly as a tale about ""Grandpa Noah."" If you want a children's book that presents this account as Biblical fact, this is not the book for you! I bought the book new as a gift for my grandchild & sold it on a rummage sale instead."
1,Threw it away!,"How can you tell a Bible story without mentioning God? How can you turn God's voice into Grandpa's??? This is shocking, blasphemy My son got this book for his dedication and I read it one time. No, I didn't give it away or take it to a book store or give it to the poor... I don't want them to read the story of the flood and think God didn't have anything to do with it. I tossed this sucker out ASAP! Shame on you Ms. Brett. Make up your own story, don't twist God's word to fill your pockets..."
1,Confused and disappointed,"I did not know that you could tell a Biblical story and not include anything biblical, such as the mention of God, until I read this book."
1,Twisted Truth,"This book caught my attention while reading it to my daughter because it says 'Uncle Noah.' The Bible makes no mention of more than 8 people boarding the ark. Some may call this a harmless child's book, but it is no mere glossing or simplification of the truths--it is changing them. If you accept modifying the Bible in small form, then in principle it opens the door for more modification. I'll be tossing this book."
2,Disappointed.,"I obviously don't know where Jan Brett stands religiously, but when I picked this book up I assumed that since it's about Noah's Ark (a Bible story!), it would be accurate to the Bible story. If you're looking for a beautifully illustrated version of the Bible story, this is not it. It doesn't mention God anywhere at all. I hoped that maybe I'd seen that she mentioned it in footnotes or in the very back. It's not linked to the Bible anywhere in my copy of the book. As another reviewer pointed out, it's also a little inaccurate in it's telling. If you're a Christian choosing books that explain Bible stories to young children, this is not it. Beautiful illustrations, but I'm disappointed."
1,Disappointed.,"Totally inaccurate accounting of the flood if you are a christian. So disappointed. The illustrations were good but I couldn't get past the way she totally screwed up the story. Seriously, did she even read Genesis and if she did, I wonder what version of the Bible she used. I bought two of them for baby shower gifts and couldn't make myself give them away knowing they would teach children an inaccurate account of the story. Come on, it's not that hard to get it right and kids have enough trouble remembering the facts without authors and illustrators leading them astray whether on purpose or from ignorance, I found it inexcusable."
4,"Jan Brett's illustrations are beautiful, & story is not overly focused on the catastrophic destruction of the world via flood...","more on the images of a child (Noah's grandson), and the animals as he sees them- sleeping, awake, crowded, etc. The story is told mostly through the images, with very short narrative of 1-2 sentences per page. This was a nice baptism gift for our niece, who is not extremely religious- as it was a bible story presented in a very friendly non-preachy tone. It would be just as nice for a child who regularly attends church/ Sunday school and is familiar with the story, as they would enjoy the pictures and be able to discuss the meaning and events in more depth with their parents."
2,Missed the Boat!,"While this book does have lovely pictures, that is about all this book has to offer. The title could have been ""On Grandpa's Boat"" and been no less meaningful. This book is no more than a grandchild sitting out a month-long spring rain storm with a bunch of animals (which would be fine if that is what you were looking for). However, if you're looking for a book to bring alive the Biblical account of Noah's ark...a story that recounts God redeeming a family in His great mercy and kindness...look elsewhere."
1,Does NOT follow biblical story line,"I was very disapointed with this book. It did not follow the biblical story enough that I felt uncomfortable reading it to my children. The most disturbing was that God was not mentioned at all, He is completely left out! A few other examples are, the Bible tells us clearly (Genesis 7:19-20)the whole earth was covered but this story says ""only the tops of the mountains poke up above the water."" In the Bible Noah first sends out a raven, then a dove, and then another dove that comes back with an olive leaf, and then another dove that does not return (Genesis 8:6-12) but in the story one dove is sent out that returns with ""a fresh green leaf from a new tree."" Also in the story, ""Grandpa Noah steers the ark to land"". But in the Bible, Noah is not the one to control the ark (Genesis 8:4), he is in Gods loving hands. I would not want someone to purchase this book by mistake, thinking they were buying a story based on the biblical account of the flood."
5,Wish it were longer!,"Written from the viewpoint of Noah's grandson, this is a charming story from onboard the ark. My just turned 2 year old loves it and I don't mind reading it over and over (and over and over). We have other Noah's Ark books but many require too much explaination or are too scary for this age group. I am planning to buy this for cousins and friends."
5,exquisite art work,"We absolutely love Jan Brett. She is an exceptional artist. This book as well as ""The Mitten"" and ""The Hat"" are some of our favorites. We read them over and over with our three year old. They are must haves in your child's book collection."
5,Multiple Splendeur,"Actually I read this book about 40 years ago and just wanted to possess and read it again, my next trip to China being the trigger. Han Suyin was and remains my favourite author for the subtelty of her writing and the refinement of her way of thinking."
1,Eegads!!!!,"This dvd is the original motion picture, not the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" episode. It does not matter because this movie is so awful it is funny even without color commentary. ""Eegah"" is inconceivably bad in all departments. This has the absolute worst dialogue the writer has ever heard on film (yes, even including ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", ""Glen or Glenda?"", ""The Creeping Terror"" and other dishonorable mentions.) The acting is horrible from all participants. The plot is ludicrous as it involves a prehistoric giant falling in love with a teenage girl and holding her and her father in a cave while her boyfried comes to the rescue! However, the icing on the cake is the music. Do not be surprised if you find yourself rolling on the floor laughing upon hearing Arch Hall Jr. sing the wretched ""I Love You Vickie."""
5,Wonderful Seller!!,"The sweatshirt i received is absolutely perfect, better than I expected! AND it arrived in record time! I definitely recommend this seller, and plan to buy from them in the future.GREAT SERVICE!"
2,Don't be fooled by the picture,"I bought this cable thinking it was a 4-core AV-cable which terminated onto 3-pole 3.5mm RCA jacks on either end, the kind that are used as AV cables for some camcorders and dual-screen DVD players. Unfortunately that was not the case. The jacks on either end of the cable are just regular 2-pole RCA jacks or 2-channel (RL) RCA headphone jacks, no Video.Anyway, returned them to get a refund. If you are looking for an AV cable, this is not it.. unlike what the picture shows. 2-stars as I'm sure it function perfectly well as a 2-pole audio cable."
1,Not as advertised,"This item was advertised as a Audio/Video cable, the image even shows or did show a three banded 3.5mm male to male cable. This item when shipped to me by Amazon was a two band 3.5mm male to male cable, so it only transmits audio and not both audio and video. I returned this product so Buyers beware!!"
4,the Drifter's Best Of... is really their best!,"These guys are a riot. I would compare them to the Smother's Brothers, or Sha Na Na... if you're old enough to remember them. The boys do comedic songs that are infectiously catchy. The styles run from early sixties pop, with Ventures guitar, through baaaad Disco with full orchestra back-up. I have to be honest about the last cuts... they really, really fall off, since they area from a TV special they had done in the 70s, which is missing the visual effect. However, with 20 or so cuts, it's a minor issue. The ""Do-rif-tahs"" are a light-hearted listening experience. BTW, they were the opening act for the Beatles first world tour in Tokyo!"
4,Funny and accurate,Mitch made me laugh until it hurt sometimes at the sametime presenting an accurate description of the Ozark dialect. A fun read.
5,Love Em!,"Came really fast! 2 days even though they werent predicted to arrive for 5-10 days later! I love them, they look great!"
2,Forgettable,"This was a low budget movie. It wasn't bad enough to make me turn it off, but it wasn't memorable either. Keep looking-- you can do better"
2,Don't even remember the movie,"Amazon keeps asking me to review this film I purchased, but I Don't even remember the movie. Guess that says it all."
2,same thing new story,I like shorts don't get me wrong! these one's just didn't do it! it was still worth the rental! if your bored!
5,Very Interesting,"I think it must be hard to write a book about North Korea that's not depressing, but somehow Micheal Harrold manages to do just that. Not many westerners have had the opportunity to live in North Korea, so his perspective is unique and interesting. He highlighted many of the problems of the country, but managed to give a certain humanity to his study of North Korea that is lacking in other books about the isolated nation."
4,Handy guide,"On many occasions the word I was searching was not in this dictionary. However, it is a handy guide and includes many of the words with their prefixes. I found the central area which is divided into categories next to useless. This section would be more useful for travelers than translators."
1,Cheap Item - Not Valuable,"I've just received this product. I was tempted to buy it from the photos and when I received it I found that it's a cheap looking design and not very light weight.Additionally, it was not well packaged and it has arrived defective (probably from transportation). But unfortunately there's nothing I can do about it because I'm outside the states and returning it will cost much more than the item price.In short, I'm sure there are better alternatives."
3,I am so tempted to buy it but...,I won't buy it due to the weight of one pound for a container holding only 10 or so cards. Its beautiful ...but I can't carry the extra weight for a card holder.
5,A must for working people,"This book has been a life saver for my house. Like many other both people work. No one can afford to go out to eat every night, nor can we spend the time on dinning out. This book has been wonderful! You can cook so many things in your crockpot. Soups, Stews, Roasts, Chili's, and much more. You can prepare your ingredients the night before, and let things cook overnight, or do so during the day. Crockpot cooking is wonderful. The slow cooking method really brings out the flavors. You and your family can enjoy tasty meals again with this great book."
2,Disappointed With This One,"I received this book as a gift. I especially liked the layout, size and presentation of the book. It is a great book to look at. I pulled it out many times to cook and found that each time it got put back unused. The recipes looked easy enough but each recipe had something objectionable about it. The recipes either required too much adjusting for my dietary needs or just didn't appeal to me. I never could get off the ground with it...END"
2,Suffers from an over-simplified worldview,"Originally published in 1973, ""Dominion Over Demons"" spells out Maxwell Whyte's arguments in defense of exorcism, but he makes the statement that ""every accident, misfortune, quarrel, sickness, disease, and unhappiness is the DIRECT result of the individual work of one or more wicked spirits."" In other words, White's book appears to promote the use of ""The Devil made me do it"" as an all-purpose cop-out. Still, this book is an interesting research tool for those who study exorcism/deliverance ministry in that it is one of the earlier books in the modern-day deliverance movement."
5,Good,It is convenient for reading a book with electronic devices. It is also good when the book cannot find in other countries
5,A Heart-Touching Work!,"Since I used to be Amish, I love to buy other Amish books. I wasn't prepared for all the tears that would flow while reading, ""Finding the Way."" Elizabeth's friendship with Rachel is so dear-even when times get tough. I recommend this wonderful Amish book to all who love to read a great book. I can't wait to read more of Ms. Yoder's books!Sicily Yoder aka Teresa Phillips"
2,A nice attempt....,"Although the story has promise, and I actually read it all the way through, I felt as though I were reading a first draft. The events did not flow smoothly, and it was often confusing to find a character ""continuing"" a conversation when it became apparent that not only was it a different conversation, but many months had passed. Where were the editors? the proofreaders?? It often felt disjointed. I have not read anything else by this writer. Maybe this was a first, and she got better?"
2,it was ok,"I thought it to be alittle amatuerly written, many typo's and the written words were very immature for this genre..this author no way compares to Beverly Lewis, Wanda Brunsetter or Cindy Woodsmall."
2,Did anybody proofread this book?!,"I'm a big fan of fiction writing about the Amish way of life. I live within a short drive of Millersburg, Ohio, & often visit the area. I thought this book would be a nice, simple read on a topic I enjoy. Wrong! It's next to impossible to follow- never in my life have I read a book with more typographical errors. There are missing quotation marks on nearly every page, it seems. A character is speaking, and then isn't, but then was actually speaking all along but the end quotes were simply forgotten. It's bizarre. The plot jumps from point to point without transition & as I was reading I found my mind wandering more along the lines of the ""What were they thinking when this was published?"" train of thought rather than being involved in the horrid plot. If you want to read about the Amish in a fictional setting, Beverly Lewis is the way to go. Trust me on this one- save your money!!"
4,"A nicely done guide, illustrating many who are often overlooked","Soldiers in Normandy: The British by Alexandre Thers is one of three complimentary mini-guides (the other two are focused on American and German soldiers), each devoted not to the events of the battle but to what the personnel looked like as they performed their duties. As such, this well designed book is a compliment to other works devoted to uniforms and equipment.Thers illustrates widely differing individual groups, including naval gunners, glider pilots, sappers, infantrymen, artillery officers, radio operators, and several other key teams. His choices allow Thers to give credit to those who are often overlooked in standard histories, such as the motorcycle dispatch riders who had an unheralded but often quite dangerous job--usually performed in complete anonymity. The text is minimal but adequate, and the illustrations are first rate. Nicely done."
4,Nobody - Soulmates,"West Coast-based Nobody works firmly in the Dublab vein of sample-based hip-hop, and on his debut, SOULMATES, shows his delicacy and moody grace. ""For Those Who Never Dream"" drifts along in a thick miasma of sound. The sonic density and layering of tracks like ""Outbreak"" or ""Sixth Sense"" present a complex beauty, reminiscent of DJ Shadow's work. And though I'm not a fan of MCs, the poetic ""Fiend of the Fix"" and the outer space funk of ""Planets Ain't Aligned"" aren't too bad (though ""Faces of the Deep"" isn't too good, either). The bass-driven ""Syde Tryps"" traverse jazzier territory with some Middle Eastern-tinged woodwinds. A beguiling debut."
1,What? I expected much more from the Ubiquity Label,"I bought this CD after seeing the cover promoted excessively in a music store on Haight Street in SF. Combining the expectations of previous Ubiquity releases with reviews making comparisons to DJ Krush, DJ Cam, Shadow, etc. I was totally disappointed in the musical content, and will go so far as saying this CD sucks! In the linear notes to this album, Nobody gives up his influences as jazz, hip hop, psychadelic rock, etc - well then how come this album is so boring and unoriginal? The guest lyricist on this album are tight, but they are insulted by these pathetic beats that should have stayed on Nobody's shelf in 1996. Krush, Cam, Shadow, etc were pioneers in turntablism, abstract beats, and fusing musical styles, and this album is the result of their, and their counterparts, musical breakthrough and success - labels will look for anything to quench the thirst of beatheads. Don't waste your time - your turntables and headphones deserve much more."
4,"Great, includes a chain.",This piece of jewelry is great. It is exactly as the description says however it includes a small chain. Perfect gift for a loved one. =)
5,Milwalkee Boots,"I love my boots. Significant high rise, no zipper, buckle, and comfortable. It's even cool in the breeze. They look really nice."
4,The Blue Book of Airguns,This is a great reference book for all types of airguns. I recommend it for those collecting or researching airguns.
5,monoteism,Finally we found out where monoteism came from and WHO was the first people to adopted it!
5,Awesome!,"I got one of these the other day, i couldn't believe how much difference it made. I hadn't thought that it would, but it's totally amazing, awesome product!"
3,Nice presentation but missing something,"This is actually a decent book to learn about macro photography. The author covers the basics of each topics in his book, but not much details as to why certain things should be or should not be done. I recommend John Shaw's Closeups in Nature."
2,Only if your using medium format,"Nice photos. However, throughout the book the author makes it well known that he primarily uses a medium format Mamiya 645. He has little use for 35mm and almost no use for D-SLR. Little actual ""how to"".Would have prefered more hands on instruction or tips."
1,poorly written,The subject material was realy good; but there was no continuity (chronilogically) which made this a very difficult book to read
2,Kitty couldn't care less,"My cat isn't too picky with treats, but she won't eat these. The metal container is cute and the treats are brown and smell like top ramen :) She played with one across the kitchen floor, but never once ate a piece."
1,Untouched by disappointed cats,"Everyone gave these treats rave reviews, so I thought I would give them a try. I have two cats, one who is very picky and one who will eat just about anything I give her, even other breath fresheners that the other cat doesn't care for. I assumed that at least one would take the bait. Both cats completely snubbed these things. Sniffed at and walked away cold. I broke one in half in case the inside might reveal more aroma. Nothing. I know all cats have different tastes, but it's a little weird that I got no reaction at all, not even a reconnaissance lick. Oh well."
3,Late Delivery - Low Volume Alarm,"This is a normal, average-looking clock with a nice-sized dial face and attractive design. The alarm volume is loud for the average person -- however, my mother, who is hard of hearing, found it was not loud enough. We will have to find another clock for her with a louder alarm. For the average person, though, this clock would be a good value for the money.We were disappointed in the slow delivery time: ordered the clock Nov. 27th, but delivery did not take place until Dec. 21st. Even after we contacted the company about not receiving the clock in the original expected time frame, they sent it via 3-day FedEx (over a weekend), so it was still an additional six days before we received it."
3,A fine clock,"Its a basic clock. Drawbacks-hard to find shutoff alarm in the dark. And if you do snooze and forget if you've turned it off or not, there is not an easy way to check it if you are not thinking that clearly at 5:00 in the morning -"
5,Great for Old People (Me),"I can hear it ""Ring"", Large Face, Works like old fashioned alarm clocks, Don't have to wind it up. Great for analog people, living in a digital World."
1,Not worth it,"The recipes in this box are fine. I do make one recipe regularly. The problem is that there are so very very few recipes in all. There are a lot of sections but the cards go on and on about the basics of nutrition and some sections that seem like they should have a recipe or two in them (Dessert? I was curious what they would have for a dessert for a toddler, well, I am still wondering) but they don't, they just discuss the topic. That is fine and interesting but they are so obviously filler for a lack of recipe ideas that it is frustrating since that is what I purchased this for. Also, there are multiple recipes on each card and finding anything again can be difficult. I guess I would have preferred a book and so I will now use this experience to form future purchases."
1,bad quality no support,there is no worst tv out there that this oneI expend $3900 dollars in Augost in 2005 the image is okbut after 39 months the signal of the cable get lost and you have to reset the tv like 100 times to get the signal of the cable backwhen I bought it they said that I will have a tv for the next 10 years for sure now I have to scrapp itsorry bad quality
5,My favorite CD of all times!,This is my favorite CD of all times! I listen to it over and over in the house and in the car. If you love worsip music you will love this one! It is a must have!
5,Continue the Worship of the King,"This recording represents the last in a trilogy of live recordings from Jerusalem which take their lives from the three pilgrim feasts of the Lord as described in Leviticus 23. Based on the Feast of Pentecost, it is a powerful celebration of the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai and the giving of the Spirit to the believers in Jerusalem.From the jubilant sounds of ""Come Let's Go Up to Jerusalem"" and ""To Him Who Sits on the Throne"" to songs of intimate worship like ""Show me your Face"" and ""Dance with Me,"" LION OF JUDAH is an extraordinary experience of powerful Messianic worship.Come to the Feast of the Lord as Paul Wilbur beckons believers to join the celebration on Mount Zion as they worship the One who pours out His Spirit!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
3,"Decent hat, but not for big heads.","I bought this cap because the beanie that I had been wearing was getting too hot for summer, and I'm not a big fan of baseball caps. The band that goes around the front end is painful on the skin. It's abrasive, like sand paper, so I have to find a comfortable position instead of being able to just throw it on, which leads to my second problem. It's too small for my head. After about 30 seconds, the hat slides up my head.The hat is very airy, and it does its job in terms of protecting my scalp while keeping it cool, but it's on the edge of being wearable or not, for me. I love the design, but it would be nice if it was a little deeper, and a little bigger. They need an XL version. For most people, this may not be a problem, so I urge you to check the other reviews as well."
3,Cheap cap but good price,This cap is very cheap the material is itchy and feels scratchy. Of course it's well priced so you get what you pay for.
4,Nice book to keep,"I got this book because I needed it for class. After reading some pages from it, it's actually not a bad book to hold on to. It's pretty thick, but there are some interesting poems and short stories in there. For those who like to read."
2,was it worth it??,"though the book had a broken binding and was pretty damaged, it was still cheaper than the bookstore!"
1,boring as hell?,I got a request to review this...there you go. It's for school...of course it's boring.
5,Best Hot Wheels Game,"I've always been surprised that this game is in the bargain bin.My son has been playing this for years. It is still one of the games he goes back to time and time again. Multiple game modes including story mode, race mode, challenges, and battle mode. As you complete portions of the game, new cars, weapons, etc... are unlocked. There are just a lot of things in here to keep you coming back. And it is just plain fun.I've bought most of the hot wheels games for my son, but none of them come close to offering the fun and value. We bought a copy for our nephews and they love it as much as my son.If you are willing to help them through some of the tougher stages, you could get thins for someone as young as four years old; if they are going to be on their own I would wait until they are a year or two older."
4,Great movie for children,"This movie is entertaining and confronts many of the topics in the Animal Farm book. However, it differs somewhat from the book and is not a replacement for reading the actual book."
3,"Not as funny as the ""stupid criminal"" stories","This book was both funny and scary. Sure, it's funny to read about bizarre 911 calls. But it's also scary to learn that some people are dumb and inconsiderate enough to call 911 for stupid things, such as finding out which gas stations are open.The dark side of this book kept me from enjoying the humor. When I read the ""America's Dumbest Criminal"" books, I whipped right through them. This book took longer. I think that's because reading about stupid criminals getting their just desserts makes us cheer. But 911 calls (except the trivial ones) are generally made by everyday people who need help.Still, it's an education. It makes me appreciate the work 911 operators go through.Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"
5,shade for '05 cooper S,"ordered this product for the 90 degree days of central florida. this shade works great with the sunroof cracked my car is 10 degrees cooler when i leave work. I do wish the shade was a little taller however, when I put it up it's not tall enough for the flip visors to hold it in place."
2,Doesn't fit the 2012 Mini Cooper S,"I wanted this for my new Mini Cooper S, 2012. It gets very hot where I live--these are essential! However, it does not fit the 2012 S. There is a large gap at the top of the shade, with additional gaps on both sides. Was hoping to avoid having to buy this from BMW, but too bad for me..."
4,Exact Fit -,"The screen unfolds from the center, slide it in atop the dash so that it doesn't hit your rear view mirror and, viola, it's blocking out the sun, cooling down your car and keeping the dash from baking.It has two tiny wings on the end of the sunshade that are annoying to keep in the deployed position, but with a little effort, see above, they completely cover the window.Materials are excellent. Purchase price is steep for a sunshade, but it is still a couple of bucks less than a Mini Dealership."
2,B-o-r-i-n-g,"The NYT says this novel ""lacks serious dramatic tension"", and the NYT is right. I kept reading and kept hoping, but I'm giving up about 1/3 through. Good ideas, good writing, zero interest.A cover blurb compares it to Malone's Handling Sin. Not. (But there aren't many books that compare with Handling Sin. Probably out of print, but get it and enjoy!)"
3,A talented writer but...,"not a whole lot happens over the course of this rather long novel. I don't have a problem with plotlessness, but it seemed to me that this book would have worked better if it had been far shorter. There just isn't much that happens that needs to be told. I'd have given it fewer stars, but the author knows how to write a sentence and has a good sense of humor, so I bumped it up to three."
2,YAWN,"There is nothing here to find offensive, but there is nothing here to warrant the trees that were destroyed to print this bloated novel. I kept wanting to like it, wanting to feel charmed or intrigued or to care about the characters more, but nothing clicked, so then I kept wondering why no one had suggested making it shorter, making it a novella maybe, or a short story. The writer has some talent, but this book isn't the one he will be remembered for."
1,Dullsville,Count me in with the people who wish the author had written a completely different book. The author relies far too much on what he mistakenly believes are charming and funny nostalgic details...but it comes off as cloying and overly clever and really rather empty. Maybe next time.
1,juvenile,"For a book with such a literary pedigree, I found it remarkably immature and self-indulgent. Sure, it all takes place in the mind of a teenaged boy, but isn't the author's job to instill something in the story to make us care, or allow us to learn? I guess it is just the new literature: taking the ordinary and keeping it that way."
5,An Absolute Pleasure to Read...Thoroughly Enjoyable,This endearing novel is exceptionally rich in character development with a wonderful southern flavor. My only disappointment was in reaching the end of this outstanding read. It was like saying good-bye to an old friend...one that you hope to see again soon. I look forward to future works by this talented new author.
5,Be honest. You need help.,"To all would-be novelists: do you need help? Is there a first line, or a first chapter, lurking in your desk drawer, waiting for your ideas to gel? Maybe scraps of ideas written on envelopes and napkins?Get organized. This book is what you need.James V. Smith covers all necessary aspects of writing novel-length fiction, up to and including a unique way to organize characters and scenes on index cards, keeping all your info available when you need it.Then, beyond the mechanical help, Smith gives you practical advice on the creative process. Learn how to revise by eliminating text; exactly how many main characters a well-crafted novel has in population; how to make those characters believable, and the reader care about them; how to start and keep going until you finish.It's as good as a fiction workshop priced at ten times the price of this book."
3,A decent book on fiction writing...,"James V. Smith's ""You Can Write A Novel"" is written for the first-time novelist looking to create a salable manuscript. Smith offers a number of valuable tips that I haven't seen in similar how-to books. One of them is to practice writing out select paragraphs of best-selling authors. In doing so, you can learn a lot about proper sentence structure, good dialogue, and powerful, action-packed sentences. The book is worth reading in order to pick up anything, just one tip that will help improve your writing. However, if you can only buy one book, I would suggest ""Stein on Writing"", ""The First Five Pages"", or ""Writing the Breakout Novel"" instead.Britt GilletteAuthor of ""Conquest of Paradise"""
2,stay away if you like creativity,"I've written a romance MS and always love reading about the craft. Unfortunately, i found myself disagreeing with so much in this book that i couldn't really study it like i wanted to. I disliked the whole mantra of the book- writing is a business, not an art, and you should only try to make it sale-able.Well, that just isn't me. I'm sorry, but i LIKE vocabulary words and sentences over 7 words, and an above 6th grade reading level. I like some -ly words to sprinkle here and there. and I like to read books like that too!I found this book very stifling and as someone else said, bossy. It was very dry and I would stress to anyone that they should write from the heart, not for your wallet."
5,The only aid you'll ever need,"Really, this book doesn't bog you down by teaching you how to write, but it instructs you on how the form of a book matters, and what editors and publishers are looking for.Simple, concise, easy to grasp. Get it!"
3,Novel Kit,"I finished reading the instructional book within the kit. The author has some helpful ideas about how to organize your thoughts. The author doesn't sugar coat anything, he seems a bit bossy and tells it like it is. Maybe some people would find this helpful? The book also implies what you should and should not do when writing a novel as well as to what words and grammar that you should not use. This was somewhat helpful. Overall the book left me feeling a little frustrated and disappointed. I felt as though the author implies it is extremely difficult to write and actually publish a novel, despite the title ""You Can Write A Novel Kit""."
1,"Buyer Beware! Wrong Title, Wrong Book","This is a total rip-off and should be given a different name.I bought the original print version of this book many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I used it over and over again and found the methods and the easy style of passing on information excellent.I bought this new edition for my Kindle, thinking I could take all this fabulous pack of information around with me.However, this ""new version"" is an absolute crock. It has very little to do with the original book ""You Can Write a Novel"", is muddled and seems to follow no sort of order, has none of the good ideas and time saving methods included in the original edition, and none of the website links it promises for the ""tool kit"" work.A complete waste of money and very sadly, you can't order the older version now.This book needs to be renamed so as not to gull people into buying it and even then it would get no stars from me."
2,I can rightz novel?,"Can't help but notice this piece has a pretty good rating on Amazon (which according to the author is a good sign) but personally not my thing.There was certainty some good grains of wisdom throughout this how-to but for the most part the focus was on dry processes, which while in theory will help you write a novel I can't help feeling I mostly did just help Smith JR pay his bills.Maybe I'm just bitter that Smith isn't into Dexter, or just too in love with Slumdog Millionaire. I much more recommend the other how-to write books in my reviews."
4,water tank,"Item arrived looked smaller than we thought it would be but works fine. We have a low flow well and when I forget the water, it takes very little time to refill this tank."
5,Excellent Suggestions for Handling Allergies,Excellent Suggestions for Handling Allergies provided by many experts in the field of natural health care. Great do-it-yourself tests and prevention advice.I plan on purchasing several copies of this video to give as gifts. My massage and nutrition clients will love it - I'm sure!The presentation is a follows:1 Defines Allergies (and Food sensitivities as allergies)2 Describes the types of reactions3 Detection / Testing for the two broad definitions of allergy via blood and self-testing4 Treatment and Prevention - The Natural ApproachWatch the video with pen and paper so that you can take notes.
5,This book saved my life and the life of my brother and son.,"Every doctor and every conventional test I took said my cholesterol was low (under 100) and my heart was fine even though my close relatives were dying of heart attack. Finally, my doctor put me on Lipitor just to shut me up. I had a heart scan out of curiousity and found I had plaque but nobody could tell me why. I followed the book's advice and had my lipoproteins tested along with my brother and son. Sure enough, we all had the same genetic blood disorder, something called Lp(a), that was causing heart attack in our family. Now we simply take niacin (a B vitamin) and it has greatly reduced the problem. I hate to accuse anyone of malpractice but every doctor and cardiologist should read this book. Perhaps my mother would still be alive if they did!"
5,track your Plaque,Very informative. Answered many questions. Glad I read it before I went to see my heart specialist.
1,Bye Bye heart disease! hello breast cancer,An informative book but leaves the following out:1. It is an advertisement for the service in an interesting way ( you pay the cost by purchasing the book)2. It does not emphasize the point that a heart scan is EBCT scan and not an MDCT scan. Lately allot of cardiology practices have been advertising MDCT scan which involves a huge radiation and kidney damage risk from the contrast used. Yes lets prevent heart disease and increase breast cancer!3. EBCT scan is a way of assessing risk and not a way to follow response to treatment. Using a heart scan to follow up response to risk factor modification is psuedoscience. there are other methods to do that.and finally as I applaud efforts to educate people about their health I despise building wealth from peoples misery. If your doctor doesn't have time to talk to you ( Find Another One)
1,Do not buy this edition! shouldn't be sold anymore!!!!!!!,There is a new edition that seems to have the new and very important discoveries in heart disease (vitamin d and K2) that are not even mentioned in this edition!I was very disappointed to find this out after reading it!!!I can not understand how they can still sell it if it lacks the new and really important information that makes the previous incomplete and not really useful!
4,Not what you might think...,This book is about what kind of people make up Special Forces A-team. The book does not tell any heroic stories or talk about dangerous missions. The book also does not talk about weapons or tactics. This is what I expected to be reading when I began to read the book. Even without this information the book is fascinating. The author is actually the wife of a former SF soldier. She basically tells the reader what kind of a person the Special Forces soldier is. She also explains what their lives are really like on a day to day basis. I found it fascinating because these people are a rare breed.
5,This book does much to fix the stereotype of these men.,"This book does alot toexplain the mission and life of these extraordinary soldiers. Many people tend to compare these soldiers to the Navy SEALs or other elite units, but to make that comparison is wrong. The author does alot to illustrate the difference in mission and trainig of the SF and other special forces units. I feel a book like this has been in need of because of the popular misconception of these soldiers as Rambos or some type of supermen. I highly recomend this book to those in the military or in the government."
1,"Incomplete, Myopic insight, Slanted, Waste of Money","Simons begins stories she never finishes. She makes allegations based on incomplete facts or no facts. Being married to a SF medic does not make one an expert on SFs. Her assessments of SF wives is not just unfair, it's unnecessary and irrelevant. The reader does not get ""Inside Special Forces"" in this book. Rather, the reader gets inside ""A.J. Simons"" and it is not an interesting nor informative place to be."
5,Bread; A Baker's Book of Techniques and Recipes,"Not for the beginner, but most definitely a book for serious bread bakers. More of an encyclopedia than a recipe book. Every possible question one might have about water and dough temperatures, etc. A must-have for serious bread baking."
5,A Bakers Reference Book,"As others have stated this is not for beginner bakers, but it is a wonderful book for the advanced bread baker. My only complaint, as others have also stated, is that I wish it were more geared to the home baker and not the professional high volume baker. The techniques and illustrations alone are worth the price of the book."
5,"Learn ""Why"" as well as ""How""","This book is appropriate for serious home bakers who want to grasp the deep knowledge of the professional. Sections are devoted to every sort of dough and dough making technique. Extensive coverage of ingredients. The recipes, as well as having ingredients for 100 loaves, are also scaled down to the home baker. If you are one who likes a bit of kitchen science, this is a great book. Not for casual use, but full of wonderful recipes and techniques which I have been able to use in my tiny kitchen and conventional oven. Working with a full knowledge of the process really helps me turn out some exceptional loaves. P.S. If you get this book, buy a high quality kitchen scale. It's the way to go."
5,Genious book,This is a genious book that will change your taste for bread.It is easy to make the most delicious breads people love.
4,Very good and comprehensive book,This book is very comprehensive yet clear and interesting for bread enthusiasts around the globe.David J. KrausFood Engineer
5,Excellent! Like an encyclopedia!,Bread Baker's Bible but easy to use for the home baker too. Wow! So much I did not know as I'm not a trained baker but just someone who enjoys making great bread. This is a treasure of great recipes with exact measurements.
5,The best bread book I own,"I own quite a few bread books and this is by far my favorite. Since I have attended the King Arthur school several times (Chef Hamelman was not my instructor) the process and terminology are very familiar to me so I have *never* had a failure with this book. The book is based on a professional baking process so it is somewhat different than most other consumer baking books. At the very least you will need a scale, good mixer and a baking stone of some sort if you want to be successful with this book. I stick mostly with the sourdough section--these are the best sourdough recipes I've ever used. If you're lucky enough to attend bread baking classes at King Arthur this is a very good book to take home for your ""home work"" until the next visit."
5,My favorite bread book,"I have many cookbooks dedicated to bread, including the Bread Bible, The Bread Baker's Apprentice, and Crust and Crumb, but if I could only have one, it would be this one by Jeffery Hamelman. I love the detailed explanations of the steps of bread baking. I wanted a book that explained what makes good bread good and the effect that various ingredients and techniques have on the finished product - that is exactly what I got with this book. The recipes are great (love the focaccia) and although I like the full color photographs in some of the other books, the line drawing type illustrations ""fit"" the book.Wonderful for learning about bread and bread baking as well as providing excellent recipes."
4,Nice book but....,"...all the decorative dough-stuff could very well be placed in a separate book, for people interested in this quite peculiar art. A lot of the pictures could be used to display breads, WITH crumb, instead of (IMO ugly) braided dough-art. The home-receipts are in us-measures only, but that is just an annoyance. Excellent sections with nice-to-know and why-am-I-doing-this compared to other books which just tells you ""do this"". I also appreciate the number of receipts, with several different variations of a base-receipt, like ""I would like to make this bread, but with more Whole-Wheat, but how much water should I then use..."""
5,Best Bread Book Ever!!!,"I totally love this book. There is so much info in it, it should be used as a text book for Baking courses (I wish I had it when I was in culinary school!). This may be a little difficult for a novice baker, but anyone in the field will have no problem. The recipes are listed in four ways pounds, kilograms, bakers' percentage (all for professional use), and then one for the home baker, which I think is way cool. I have tried a few recipes so far and they all were great! I can't wait to try out more!"
5,"Excellent on technique, good recipes, no ego","This is one of the best bread books. All the space others devote to photos and ego is given over to solid tested recipes and really good information on technique in this one.Don't be put off by the fact that Hamelman includes three versions of each recipe, one sized for bakery yield, one sized for home use, and one in between. Just keep your eyes on the righthand column and follow the home version.Especially good on variations of rye. Just buy this one. More value than some of the higher-falutin competition."
4,A great reference,"I'm an avid fan of Mr. Hamelman and was quite eager when this book hit the shelves. I've spent a good bit of time in a professional bakery, though these days I'm strictly a 'serious home baker.' I think there's a lot of great stuff in this book, but I can agree with some of the reviews that it's a bit much, sometimes dry, and perhaps overwhelming for a new baker. Personally, I love every last densely packed page of information. If you're quite new, though, I'd take to something by Peter Reinhart, and then come back to this when you have a few good loaves under your belt."
4,Great read/gift,"I have given this book as a gift to 2 people who make bread as a hobby. Both really enjoyed it. It is well written, entertainining book by a man who seems to have a real passion for baking. In addition to the recipes there is description of the process and science of baking."
3,Lots of Recipes For the Advanced Baker,"This book is layed out well and provides a lot of info and recipes. I found it to be a little too advanced for my intermediate bread baking abilities. Plus, the book wasn't very much fun to read. I usually enjoy reading cookbooks, this one just didn't hold my attention."
2,Inaccurate Recipe,"The first and only recipe I have tried was wrong. The ingredients were so inaccurate the dough was not viable. It had to be trashed. After this experience, I wonder if the other recipes are accurate. This book is not for someone trying to learn the basics of baking beard."
1,Pilates Golf DVD doesn't work,The money would be better spent on a beer after the round of golf than for this product. The movements are gone through too quickly and are not explained nearly well enough.
4,Not entire set...,"Books are in very good condition! Received them in a timely manner. Was upset because I hadn't read the entire description and I was looking to buy the entire set, but that's on me."
5,Great reading for Preteen/teen girls,"These books are great, even in these days of computers and gadgets! They take you back to a time of simplicity, love, making the most out of nothing and morals. Lessens taught and life experiences shared through the eyes of a young girl in a new and unexplored world. Makes you wish that you were Laura Ingalls, experiencing the daily things she called life."
3,Little House the Laura Years Boxed set/The Early Years Collection,"I gave it a three star rating and it arrived as promised in good condition.Thanks,Dolly Hamby"
4,A classic for 'A' level Physics,A comprehensive classic for A level. So comprehensive that I still keep and refer to it when study for degree course. Keep it with you too.
4,"Great CD, hope they put out another studio release","There are so many heavy metal bands from the eighties and early nineties, and plenty that fell by the wayside. Many of these are now making comebacks. Leatherwolf is/was a truly special band that deserves to give it another try. I hope they release another studio CD. Songs like THUNDER, THE CALLING, and HIDEAWAY are only some of the classic metal tunes these guys put out. The guitar players (three of them - the singer also plays! ) are awesome."
3,...shocked at advice...,"I bought this book to find a way to deal with pet damage--specifically dog damage! I was disappointed and, frankly, a bit appalled at their advice. The first pearl of wisdom is to try and keep the dog off the grass...oh, please, can we get real? And the other ""wonderful"" bit of advice is to buy a bigger lawn (as if everyone can afford that luxury) or get a smaller dog--which I think is absolutely ludicrous!! How many people that own a large dog are just going to trade it in for a smaller one? Most people who have pets treat them like a member of the family! I was hoping for a pet-safe chemical treatment...no such luck. I wonder if the authors of this book own pets. The rest of the book seems pretty good..."
4,Scotts,I found this book very useful. I am new to the wonderful world of lawn care. This book was very helpful for new people as well as vets. I was a little disappointed that there where no reference to Canadian climates but I guess the Northern States are close enough. I also thought that since it was a Scotts book there would be all sorts of Scotts adds and reference to Scotts products but wasn't that bad in this book. Well done!
4,Just the Best VB Teacher,"Why Did I review a book that is not ready to Sell? Because Mr. Balena is one of the best VB teaches and programmers around the word. I've been reading his articles in VBPJ magazine and they are excellent. I was at VBits'99 Chicago listening to Mr. Balena speak at different Workshops and I asked him if all this good stuff is include in the book and He said, in his Italian accent, "" YES!"", and the book is huge too (I did not realize it has 1,400 pages). Buy it. I already did. Why Did I give it 4 stars and not five? Because the publisher is Microsoft. :-) Gonzalo Medina"
1,"Excellent book, horrible binding","The book itself is excellent, though definitely not for beginners. Comprehensive, well researched, and fairly well written. The code samples that are included on the CD-ROM are also excellent and extensive; you can use these in your own programs.I gave the book 1 star because of the horrible binding. The book began to fall apart after a few months. Eventually, the entire spine separated from the pages. I have had to resort to using glue to get them back in, a very messy process. The book looks physically horrible now. This is disgraceful in a book of this cost."
2,Not for the rest of us,"If you want to work at Microsoft maybe this is the book to study. If you are not a professional programmer and are trying to make a simple program, get another book. Amidst allthe unnecessary details, I could not find information on how to make a simple executable that could run without invoking the whole VB6 code."
3,"Good book , but sometimes you lose a point",The book sometimes concentrates on not essential explanations so that you lose a general author's point
2,author shoud be banned from writing programming books,"code snippets are fragmented and some variables are used withoutnaming their types, causing confusion in many cases.the chapters on classes and objects and databases are worthless:i'm glad i didn't learn objects and databases from this guy.many explanations are needlessly lengthy and confusing.i've documented with profane remarks so many problems in this book that are simply not sharable."
2,Not for beginners,"This book is definitely preaching to the converted. In other words if you are already an experienced VB programmer I'm sure its great. But for a VB beginner like me its no good. (I have been programming other languages for ten years.) The basics are breezed over and example code uses syntax that is yet to be discussed, so it gets very confusing. I would suggest that anyone who wishes to learn VB find another book. That is what I will be doing!"
4,A Great Reference,"I am totally new to V.B. and am attempting to write a fairly complex application straight off. EVERY time I have been stuck I have refered to this book and it has so far always helped me out. As a beginner I do not always immediatly grasp the code samples, but after searching through some more basic texts then returning to this book, I have so far always got the results I am aiming for. It is almost as though the author has looked at what i am trying to do, then sat down and written an example or two of how I can accomplish it!If I could only recommend one VB 6 book, this would be it. Great stuff."
5,"A rare book - easy reading, then can be used as a reference",This is indeed the best VB6 book I've ever seen. If you're completely new to programming (or indeed VB) then this should not be your first VB book. I had used VB4 in a previous job and so considered myself between beginner and intermediate. This book started off just right for me and quickly took me a lot further.My only criticism is that I found the sections on database access a little confusing. There are a few different database access techniques and I felt that the author didn't clearly distinguish between them - however this is a minor complaint.It's very easy to read and I find myself carrying it around with me and referencing it every day. If you want to be good at VB6 then you must get this book!
2,Too much code,"Even for a programmer, this book might seem overwhelming. The author delves right into programming without explaining some basic structure of VB, i.e: data types, available functions. Also, the reader is expected to understand all the code written in the book without any help from the author. The author only provides an overview of what the code does. There is very little explanation regarding the functionality of functions used from the VB library. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are a non-programmer or a beginner in programming."
4,Staright forward walk through,"Good book for the novice with some experience programming but new to VB 6. Walks through the differences between other versions, and has some nice documentation.I would recommend."
5,Very good comprehensive coverage of VB6,I am a new programmer fresh out of college and I needed a book to help me face the new VB challenges I have everyday. I have not encountered one problem yet that wasn't dealt with by this book. The OOP and ADO sections are thorough and very easy to understand. Mr. Balena has done an excellent job of covering VB6 broadly from the very basic concepts to advanced techniques. This book is a good investment for VB developers at any level.
5,Best VB Book I've Read,"I don't think I've read a book that covers VB in such an intense and complete way. Just about everything is covered and with a depth that never left me needing more. The examples are good and the writing is clear. It even works as a good reference book (unlike many other computer books). I keep it at my desk at all times.I recommend this book to people who have a little bit of VB experience (or just general programming experience), but not to the complete novice. It moves quickly so the novice programmer may not be able to keep up without more indepth explanations. Overall, I've found this to be the best book on general VB programming on the market."
3,Some VB knowledge required,"If you are new to VB, I would recommend buying ""Programming in Visual Basic 6.0"" by Julia Case Bradley and Anita C. Millspaugh. Francesco's book is written as if you already know some basic stuff about VB. Francesco's book is comprehensive, it's just not for beginners."
5,Your best choice if your an experienced programmer,"If your sick of manual ""rehashes"" and need real how to information, get this book. It's not for beginners, but is extremely well written. As an experienced programmer (20 years) I found this book to be the most usefull of all the various VB books I have purchased or examined. Every time I browse this book I find something new and usefull, and find it difficult to put down."
4,Why am I writing a review for this supposedly outdated book,"Because Visual Basic 6 remains a very useful programming environment for me. Mr. Balena's style goes way beyond a tutorial through menu creation. He tells us about pratfalls of the Microsoft environment ( while writing for Microsoft! ) and useful ways to work around limitations of the environment. If you are still using VB6, like I am, this is a useful reference. We might want to start looking at .NET, eh?"
4,Love Falls Down Christian Worship Music,"Beautiful singing and worship by Sheila Walsh-WHAT A VOICE!! I enjoy this cd! Best songs are Love Falls Down,Always,Where Truth And Mercy Meet, You Are Jesus, and I'll Be Waiting. A Lot better music cd than ""Blue Waters"" which I did not care for at all and I just could not get into it. I would get ""Love Falls Down"",""Hope"" and ""Celtic Christmas"" to start if you are just getting her music cd's. I think ""Hope is my very favorite cd and all the songs are just wonderful!"
5,Prabhu's writing is Awesome,"This book not only provoked deep questions about science, religion, and God, but also touched upon the lighter side of human life. I found the dialogues between the children and adults fascinating. The author's portrayal of characters is superb. Scenes from the life of graduate students and professors are so real that one feels to be a part of this book."
5,Captivating,"I was moved to tears reading the book. I read it cover to cover in one sitting. Since Snow Crash (Stephenson) this book is the only one I have found that mixed science, fiction, and religion (metaphysics) in such a powerful way. It is a book everyone must have."
5,"Never gets ""old!""",I don't think this play will ever truly become dated. The themes are just to basic to human nature. There are cultural issues that come through -- issues I think still prevade in American culture. Arthur Miller will be one of the best forever.
5,He Leadeth Me,This is one of the best Spiritual Books I have ever read. If you have trouble with God or you idea of God this is a must read. This book will help people with addictions and works well with a twelve step program.
5,Perhaps the most inspiring book I have ever read.,"Our parish priest referred to ""He Leadeth Me"" in his homily recently and I thought the book might be interesting. Little did I know that I would find Father Ciszek's message to be one of the most inspiring I have ever read. Throughout his terrible ordeal he never lost his faith in God. No matter what the Russian authorities attempted to do to him, Fr. Ciszek knew that by turning his life over to God and doing God's will he had nothing to fear. Fr. Ciszek found God where most of us would find only despair. I strongly recommend this book to everyone. I know you will be inspired by the message of God's love."
5,Surprisingly applicable to modern Americans,"I started reading He Leadeth Me because I thought it might have some interesting thoughts on God and suffering, as a general concept. I had no idea, however, how very applicable Fr. Ciszek's hard-learned insights would be to my day-to-day life as the average American stay-at-home mom.The wisdom he learned after five years in solitary confinement and 20+ years at a Siberian slave labor camp is not just how to grow closer to God in the face of great upheaval and suffering, but how to know and live God's will in the face of the frustrating, the humdrum, and the mundane.I can't recommend this book highly enough to everyone -- whether you're experiencing great suffering or just frustrated by the daily grind, you will undoubtedly find Fr. Ciszek's story life-changing."
5,Simply Profound Modern Spiritual Classic,"A wonderful spiritual classic that helps bring perspective to life realizing that every moment is ordained by God and meant to draw you closer to Him even if it means experiencing unimaginable suffering. An easy, yet profound read. I received it a week earlier than expected and my parents and I all read the same copy in the past 3 weeks. I'll be getting more copies since this is one I would want all my friends to read as well as keep on my own bookshelf."
5,These are the Serenade Recordings to Own,"I'm a great fan of Sir Charles, but I'm of two minds about his celebrated and controversial Brahms Symphony set. I think the chamber-orchestra approach takes away from almost as much as it brings to this music. On the other hand, I'm willing to say that Brahms's two youthful serenades have never sounded fresher or more piquant than in these wonderful performances, especially the Serenade No. 1, which has all the ""look-at-me-world"" audaciousness that Brahms must have felt in putting his first orchestral work to paper. It glows, especially in Telarc's crystalline recording. Sir Charles's way with the sweeter, more sedate Second Serenade is just as winning, but it's the performance of the First Serenade that I still, joyously, hear resounding in my imagination."
3,"""Historically Authentic"" Brahms","While Charles Mackerras has come up with a new reason to record Brahms' Serenades, a historically accurate Brahms is not necessarily a beautiful Brahms. Sir Charles' muscular interpretation may win points for enthusiasm, but Bernard Haitink and the Concertgebuow Orchestra did it better on an old Philips recording. Still it is an honest sound and the Serenade No. 1 is a wonderful piece of music full of the youthful exuberence of the young Brahms. I never get tired of this piece. The melodies are glorious and familiarity does not diminish its capacity to warm the heart. It deserves to be performed more often. Sir Charles has done us a good turn by reminding us how great it is in his new recording."
4,Perfect!,"We are doing a DIY beach wedding. These chocolate molds are helping us DIY the most adorable personalized favors. We're making these chocolates at home. We are wrapping them up inside of white tulle circles from Dollar Tree, & then boxing them in Wilton 2"" by 2"" boxes that we bought from Party City, then wrapping the boxes with satin ribbon tied in a bow at the top (the ribbon came from the craft store), & gluing a tiny seashell to the center of each bow (the seashells came from Oriental Trading.com). These will be perfect. The chocolates are smaller than small. They are TINY, but in conjunction with the larger candy molds I bought at the local craft store, they will mix & match rather nicely. The only word of caution I have is that you should understand that they really are TINY chocolates. The sand dollar sections are about the size of a quarter. I will upload a picture of the mold with some pennies place on it for a better idea of the size."
5,A pleasant surprise,"Based on the title I would not have picked this book, but it was chosen by my book club. What a pleasure to read. Well written and one of the best overviews of what San Francisco was like at the turn of the century including during the 1906 earthquake. All of the members of the book club enjoyed this book and many have recommended it to friends."
1,Dont waste your time on this one,"An obviously pro-chinese American guilt complexed attempt to rewrite the truth (history) about the poor sanitation of the period's Chinese people. Its not a coincidence that plague broke out in Canton, Honolulu China-town and then San Francisco China-town. These places were rat infested, feces covered, disease breeding grounds. Its sad that so many people feel the need to interpret the past with the politically correct view of the present. Lets leave the truth alone no matter how ugly it is and in that way learn from it instead of what this book attempted to do. I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Severely Disapointed,"I never received the book... Aparently someone that was supposed to put it in the mail, took it and sold it for a quick buck instead... I needed this book for several asignments in college and cannot find this book anywhere else... They said that I would get a full refund, but I still have not received any refund... So basically I'm screwed... Thank you Amazon..."
1,"Doesn't Work, Support non-existant",Got the PC version so I could play on trips. Would not load on my Windows 7 PC (just says incompatible). No updates or patches available on the website. Have tried to contact EagleGames.net with no response. Stay away unless you have Windows XP.
3,Respectable Translation,"If you're a fan of the board game, this is a no-brainer. It's got hot-seat, LAN, and solo play (AI on the solo play is mediocre). The interface isn't what I would call polished, and it takes some getting used to. The resolution options are limited to older resolutions, so newer HD displays (particularly widescreen ones) may make it looks stretched, distored, fuzzy or small--but still passable. Graphics are so-so. But it's definitely worth having on the laptop for filler--and can be played online with friends. Takes the hassle out of setting up all the bits and managing them if you have a hankering to play but don't feel like handling all the bits."
3,Beware: Online Multiplayer does not work.,"Nice translation of my favorite board game. Multiplayer via LAN will work, but online will not. (Even though it states online on the box.)The AI is not very good. First game I beat the top AI, while still refreshing myself on the rules.You should pick it up if you can find it at a bargain price..."
5,"""Must have"" for anyone in Satellite Communications.","Bruce Elbert's Introduction to Satellite Communications is the very best starting point for learning the basics of communications by satellite. Its scope goes beyond generalities but deals with specific topics from the world of satellite. Well organized and readable, it is an excellent companion to Mr. Elbert's other book, The Satellite Communication Applications Handbook. Both are ""must read"" and ""must have"" references for engineers and non-technical types!"
3,This book has been updated in 1999,Get the newest version from Artech House publishers. It's up to date and very informative.
5,A good addition to your telecommunication references,This book is very useful if you are trying to pave your way into the field of satellite communications.You will later find out that the book can still serve you as a handy reference when you are already involved and experienced with satellite communications.
4,Thorough coverage of Satellite Communications,"This book does a great job of discussing commercial satellite communications. It is up to date, and includes excellent industry examples and technical details. This book will fill in your knowledge gaps."
5,Intriguing Read,"This book was as interesting as my professor said. It was hard to put it down at night. Steven Ozment does a phenomenal job of interweaving history, politics, religion, and actual firsthand accounts of life in the sixteenth century."
2,"vaguely interesting, but distasteful","For a book about a sex scandal, it's very bloodless. Obviously all the passion was saved for court. The love letters are interesting, but very little of the charactor of Anna Buschler comes through in the rest of the book. Yes, women of that time and place left a very light mark on history, but she just doesn't ""come alive"" the way the charactor of her father does. Eventually, the story the book tells spirals down into just some nasty courtroom feuding among family members. Perhaps this book should have been written to focus on a long-running legal battle in a sixteen century German town, but sex sells better."
5,Great budget Mp3 Player.,"This is a great little MP3 player. Holds somewhere around 50 songs (give or take 10). The Fm tuner works great, and the included software is easy to set up and use. The microphone worls pretty well for what it does. All-in-all, a great deal."
1,Misleading. This is a Christian book not a Jewish one,"Mr. Stern is practicing deception. He was born as a Jew and has converted to Christianity.This means that the doctrine he is preaching is a Christian one. It is not a Jewish one, as it is totally out of accord with fundamental Jewish belief as to the nature of G-d."
1,Propaganda,"It's obvious what works like this are trying to acheive, and just how duplicitous and destructive they can be. The logical, thinking reader should look elsewhere... This book is so biased it will make your intellect wince!"
5,Intalectual Eye Opener,This is the most concise and accurate writing that I have ever seen on this subject. I highly recommend reading this to anyone regardless of religious or ancestral background.
4,Another Very Good if not excellent book...,I love Bob Greene's books...this is one of the earliest...if not the earliest of his compilations of articles...not all the subjects of the chapters interest me...but it is a very good book...
5,Revisiting the Past,"I remember taping this off of PBS years ago, and I still enjoy watching it to this day.The ""modern"" QE2 footage was actually shot on a voyage in 1979; my mother was embarking on a Holland America cruise the exact same day the QE2 was arriving in New York.It's great to see how cruising and ships were 30 years ago. Although it's a transatlantic crossing, you can see passengers learning how to dance ""The Hustle,"" non-digital casino games, REAL food, and people dancing to big-band jazz.The rest of the documentary really shows the beauty of the gigantic and graceful liners of the past. It really stirs up the yearning to take a trip on an elegant, luxurious ship."
3,"stimulating, but full of holes","This is one of those books that works better on the first reading that a second.Consider the first sentence. ""I, too, seek an unreadable book: urgent thoughts to grapple with in agitation and excitement, revelations to be transformed by or to transform, a book incapable of being read straight through, a book, even, to bring reading to a stop.""In such a passage Nozick very cleverly draws in the reader as a co-conspirator. Notice the second word, ""too,"" in which he presumes that he can read his reader's mind. The first time through, you will be charmed by such stylistic tricks. And since Nozick is not without insights, you will learn something from this book while he is exercising his charms.But gradually you will realize that there is less to it than meets the eye. It is not only not the ""unreadable"" book he says he wants, it is an overly readable book. Too much cleverness, not enough wisdom."
2,Very unique bracelet!,It is a very unique bracelet except it is very small. It should only fit either a young teenager or someone with a very tiny wrist! Too bad!!
1,Bad Quality,The elastic band was on the verge of breakage.The elasticity was totally gone and beads were falling apart.Just initiated a return.Not worth.
3,Does the job,"I got this for my wife and it is not the best we came across. Mostly our fault.To grate across the flat surface, the whole thing seems to slide or move a bit.So we went with another product."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this item based off reviews from other buyers and I'm extremely disappointed. I was replacing a similar Japanese grater set, but the graters on this set are so poor, and make an enormous mess, I'm still having to use my old one. The slicer component is so wide, that I might as well use a knife to be more accurate, and the hand protector is useless as it doesn't slide properly. I would recommend spending more on a quality item, that doesn't increase your kitchen work load."
3,It's not bad but it's not great either,"I bought this mostly for garlic, cheese and carrots. It works ok most of the time. I wish the finger guard had less of a gap and it could be just how I'm doing this but I find a lot of the food doesnt end up inside the container but stays on top of the shredder. It's not bad but like I said, it's not the greatest shredder ever."
5,"good grater, great deal","I was shopping the other day and Walmart wanted more for a cheap grater of the near same design than Amazon delivered this one. It is very nice to use and contains a gadget that protects your hands that I didn't notice when I bought this one. Handy, easy to clean, container makes less mess than a hand held grater. I recommend it to anyone."
5,Great grater,Does an excellent job making sliced potatoes. Did a great job grating onions also. I really like how it holds what you have sliced or grated. Can't wait to use the rest of the attachments. Just remember to use the plastic guard when slicing. It will protect your fingers.
5,Nice and sharp,This set is really great! The steel is sharp and the whole set can be stored easily at my kitchen.
5,Great tool,I love grating cheese with this product. No mess because the cheese goes right into the container and is easy to transfer
2,Not Good,"* The below review has been given by my wife *I got this 6 - Piece Grater set from Amazon. But I was very much disappointed seeing its performance. It does not grate the carrots, cucumber and beetroots as well as I would expect it to. There are different blades for different shapes but not one is effective. Bad product."
4,I use it all the time!,"I love this grater set. It is easy to use, the plates are easy to change out and wash. I hate those stand up graters that you can't get your hand inside of to clean well and there's always gunk inside of. This grater set is sooo much easier.You can see exactly how much you've grated through the clear sides. All the parts fit easily inside for storage. I wish it had a piece to slip in for storing items in the fridge, though. So that you could grate your cheese, wash the grater plate, then slip in a storage plate for keeping the grated cheese good in the fridge. I also have not been able to use the hand guard, it just slips off the food.All in all, a great product for a great price!"
3,A little disappointed,"A decent idea, having different blades, at a reasonable price. My problem is with the included ""pusher"", which you're supposed to use for safety to protect your fingers. I simply couldn't get it to work in a satisfactory manner. The grater works, but be careful. Throw the ""pusher"" away."
4,Maggie,"super nice grater set, considered a mandolin but this is really better and great for the price.highly recommend.Stores nicely also."
4,just what I was looking for...,Has multiple graters that sit on top and a measuring plastic base that catches the material being grated. The angle is just right. Great value
4,"Nice grater but the ""hand guard"" is a joke!","Got this grater recently and really like it. The compartment makes it easy to collect the cheese. It could have been a bit wider but it works well still. The grating plates also work well individually if you want to quickly grate cheese over food on the fly. My only complaint is with the hand guard - that piece of plastic with little spikes that is supposed to grip the cheese and protect your hands as you grate. Great concept but poor execution. The spikes don't really dig that far into the cheese and end up sliding off the cheese as you grate, also creating deep scratches in the process. Pretty useless for the most part.Other than that it does its job well."
2,Too much of a hassle,"I love cheese and I was really looking for a good quality cheese grater. I saw this and I was so excited because of the different options. Unfortunately, it's INCREDIBLY annoying to use. The zest option doesn't even work properly - I've tried to zest lemons and limes (neither time worked). It's just annoying that you have to put it in the white plastic part and then grate. I also feel like you don't have as good of a grip on it and the plastic protector is useless. Don't get it."
3,functional,"I bought this thinking i could grate cheese and then have a handy lid to plop on the top.There was no lid, just the grating covers. They really should have included a cover for functionality."
3,Basic,"If you don't grate and slice a lot, this is a nice compact set and the blades work well enough. it's definitely not for heavy use but can get you by."
5,I love it,"It sliced, it shreds. Nice for cheese, tomatoes, potatoes, anything you need to cut/slice/shred, . . . . . . ."
4,Updating Kitchen Gadgets,Was looking for a new grater and came across this. Like that what you are shredding/grading is contained and can be measured. The single slicer is very sharp and does a nice job.
4,"Nice compact grater, takes up very little space in cabinet","This may not be the best grater on the market but for the price it fit my needs. IT is very easy on clean-up and has a nice size ""catcher box"" that you grate into. When grating potatoes some do remain on top of the grater but at least they are not all over my counter like the box grater I had been using. My only complaint is the holder that is included. I have found it to be very difficult to hold anything. It is all plastic and just does not dig into anything to hold it. Other than that it works well."
1,Be extremely careful with the blade,"The design of the slicer is really bad in regard of safety.I cut myself whe I was removing the sticker tht covers the blade. To be fair you are warned about the blade in the instructions, but it shouln't be so dangerous."
1,ready for the trash in less than 2 months,"First couple of uses and I was some what pleased. Some food wound up on the counter and not in the container when grating, but I could live with that. What I cannot live with is a product that is less than 2 months old and no longer useable. The grater blades will no longer fit into the holder -- not a single one of them. One of the graters plastic surround has cracked, creating a bacteria breeding ground. Evidently, there has been some dimensional changes in the plastic in less than two months of use, so it no longer fits together. I would send it back, but shipping cost vs price makes that a questionable option. I would not buy this item again nor can I recommend it. Although the product is rated dishwasher safe, I believe that it isn't and that is the reason it no longer fits together. And no, my hot water isn't too hot."
3,"Cheap, but cheap.","This is a good ""value"" grater, but that's what you're getting. For around $10, it's hard to beat the multiple attachments and storage container, but a couple of misses:1. It just isn't that sturdy. Trying to grate a block of cheese on this requires you to attempt to place your hand somewhere on this box to keep it from sliding around. It's not that easy, and causes grating to be more difficult than it should be.2. It's too narrow. As others have said, big blocks of cheese are difficult to grate with this, as it is oddly narrow across the face.Although those are the only two complaints I have, they're relatively major so it's docked a few points. And for something that has a lot of attachments that you'll need to store somewhere, you'd want to make sure you don't have to buy a second grater for larger pieces of cheese. All in all, a good buy for small jobs and for people who have the space to store it, but I'd recommend a larger box grater if you plan on getting serious."
2,Food everywhere,"Maybe I need to practice my grating skills, but whenever I grate anything some ends up in the attached cup, but some ends up on top of the grater and inevitably ends up all over the counter.The grater only allows you to grate horizontally. This feels more comfortable than vertical grating and allows you to grate more quickly.The plastic seems solid and the blades are sharp. The quality is good, but having food end up everywhere is annoying."
5,I can't understand why others don't like this product,"I cook at home pretty seriously and I have a wide range of graters and slicers in my cabinets. I bought this product for one specific purpose, to grate cheese. I wanted something that allowed me to grate a wide variety of cheeses quickly and easily and have them in a container, ready to use in a dish.I have used this for English Cheddar, Parmigiano-Reggiano, aged Gouda, Gloucester, and any type of hard to semi-hard variety of cheese. Soft cheese, not so much, of course. I like that the container keeps the cheese in one place and makes it easy to dump into a dish or to use as a topping.Yes, I wish that it was a little bigger and yes, I wish that it had a lid (although I would seldom use it.) Still, this is a very nice grater for what it was designed for. I use it often."
4,"Mostly happy, but a bit of a pain to clean","I've used this product primarily for grating blocks of cheddar cheese, but I've also used it on a vegetable or two. (I usually use mySwissmar Borner V-1001 V-Slicer Plus Mandoline 6 Piece Setfor vegetables.)The modularity and compact nature of this grater setup is really nice. Unfortunately, it also makes it a bit of a pain to clean. After grating a block of cheddar, I have to scrub three separate pieces- the grater, the frame, and the bin.The finest grating surface is especially tough to clean; little bits of cheese can get stuck between the blades, and short of breaking out a toothpick or something, it's very hard to dislodge them."
2,Too Small,The mandoline blade is just too small to adequately handle most of what I want it to do. Wish I had bought a different mandoline.
3,Headline,"Haven't used it yet, but it appears to be sturdy enough to handle most grating-related tasks. If not, you'll be hearing from me.... :)"
1,waste of money,"This grater is being returned today. The grater/container is very, very small and has no lid to store the leftovers. Why make a container and not include a lid?"
2,Not what I wanted,"I had wanted an onion cutter that cuts onions like the type I see in the stores but it isn't right one. Not that it is doesn't do other things perfectly, but it is not the right onion cutter for me."
3,Broken backlight?,"Have been using this for the past couple months and it has worked every time in waking me up. I don't like that it takes two different type of batteries to operate it(9V + 2x AAA), but hopefully they will last a while.Only problem with mine is that the back light does not work, kind of annoying, but no point of returning it in my opinion."
2,Whisper alarm,If you want a loud alarm DO NOT buy this one unless you can try it out first. I have had one of these before and it worked fine which is why I ordered this one. Either they have changed the alarm on the clock or the one I got is defective because it is the softest alarm sound I have ever come across. Could not possibly wake me up.
2,"Broken upon receipt, but fast easy return","Upon reciept of this unit, I had a hard time setting the clock as the buttons would not seem to work quite right. I replaced the batteries, and still had issues. When trying to set the alarm time, I realized if I squeezed the plastic on the exterior with slight pressure, the times would change without pressing buttons. I returned the product immediately"
2,this should be in the description somewhere,"But the alarm turns itself off after what seemed like about a minute. This is not a great feature if you are one of those people who are pretty stubborn about getting out of bed -- you need a clock as stubborn as you are! I'm not sure what the point is of this feature, but maybe it's useful to some people. Either way, they should say this in the description. I returned this and got a different one that doesn't shut itself off."
1,You get what you pay for,"I received mine with a short of some kind. Portions of the digital numbers disappear when the alarm is turned on, but are all OK when the alarm is off. It's for my kids and they don't care so I will keep it. If I had purchased it for myself, I would be sent back immediately."
3,Has no light !,"The sound is very loud just like I need it, it's great but it has no light to look at it in the dark.It does not say it has lights on the web but I assumed it had it so I was a little disappointed."
5,works great,i bought this because i have a exercise machine that has pedals that keep coming loose and the bolts that hold the cranks on kept coming loose. after a year of putting it off i finally ordered some loctite and put it on the bolts and now i can use the exercise machine every day.
5,Works Great as always,"When it comes to accessories that bolt on to weapons, one should always apply loctite to the screw attachments. I've used loctite blue over the years on multiple rifles, mg's etc. and none have ever had any issues despite heavy firing schedules. I would not hesitate to buy again."
5,Works well,"Bought this product to secure my scope mount to my 10/22. Worked very well. Now when I shoot, the scope mount doesn't shake loose."
5,Don't Leave Home Without It.,"I have used this stuff for years in both the industrial and home settings. Automotive, firearm anything that you don't want parts to come loose on.. It is the best. The squeeze tube is a little funky for a liquid but I can overlook that. Used to be available in a small bottle holding about the same amount."
4,Pretty good vocab learning,"The author is very excited about his love of vocabulary and a person's vocabulary having an effect on their success. This helps to motivate you along with the host of new words you'll learn. The exercises are good but there could be more of them. Overall, its very informative and a worth the cost."
2,There only 2 good songs on the cd.,"This cd is headlined by Dopehouse Records arists' SPM, Low-G, and Rasheed. Que Onda and High So High are the only good tracks on the cd. I believe Charles Chavez (exe.producer) is trying hype up his own weak artists, such as Lifestyl. Lifestyl are my boys, but the song Rewind is just plain horrid."
4,Good for completists and collectors.,"I don't like cheating when I'm playing a video game, and with Metal Gear Solid 3, it was no different. I have successfully completed the game multiple times without cheats, and recieved many of the special items and camos and such. The reason I got this cheat disc wasn't necesarily to cheat, but to get items that are, as far as is known now, unubtainable normally in the North American release of MGS3. There are certain camos and face paints abtained in the Japanese version by using Japanese only products, and despite being programmed in the game, these particular things have not been discovered yet in the NA version with conventional means, and luckily this disc provides them in their entirety. If you're a fan of this game and the series, and you want to have absolutly everything, this is the way to do it. If you're new to the series, I suppose this would help you out if you're having trouble, but I recomend this as a last resort, try to enjoy the game as is."
5,Excelente cd....bella voz!!!,"Un disco muy bello este cd de la gran cantante brasilera Astrud Gilberto. Composiciones y adaptaciones pertenecientes a la gran época de ""música disco"" de los 70. Excelentes arreglos, lástima que no salgan los nombres de los integrantes.Excelente intervención del legendario trompetista y cantante Chet Baker. Un disco para disfrutar."
4,Just amazing,"The price is quite high, and the smell is unique and special.If you already know it I highly advise you to take it.Lovely, charmly, great smell."
4,Ok Grill Set,"Bought this set a year ago. Amazon had a Friday sale and had this set for $9.99. Good looking hefty set. Definitely not flimsy. After 1 year, a brass rivet on the spatula came off. Still works okay."
3,Decent Quality,"Fairly robust, only complaint is that the tongs are pretty massive (all pieces in this set are pretty large) the tongs have pretty high resistance and are ""springy"" makig it difficult to handle anything small like hot dogs or brats without sort of fighting to keep them closed on your food. They are probably meant for larger pieces of meat and serve that role just fine."
2,"Works, but is Way OVERPRICED","It works, but does not allow my 1/4"" plug to penetrate to the full depth that other female receptacles do. Worse, I paid over $12 with shipping and could have purchased other adapters for a small fraction of the price."
5,Totally Awesome,"This is, in my opinion, the best of the Daine books. This girl really gets into things when she loses her temper. The vivid details make you see in your mind the chaos that an angry Daine can create with the help of all of her friends."
5,THE BEST ONE YET!?!?!! *^.~*,"Tamora Pierce does it again!!! This is by far the best one in the series!! Diane is off with Numair and the lioness to see the emporer *That's not how u spell it oh wel!* Mage and hopefully sign a peace treaty. Diane is along to cure the emporers birds who r deathly sick! But The emporer is Numair long time enemy. And although he seems nice there could be trouble, a prince who is taken with Diane, A graveyard hag who has seemingly come to life, and a whole new pwer for diane!! *At least for diane!!!* The ending is the greates thought!"
5,This was one book I didn't risk putting down - I'd go crazy!,"I've read Wild Magic, and Wolf-Speaker, and I think this one was the best. I don't know why - please don't ask. But this one involved the Gods more than the ones before, and, well, this one had more action, and was more thrilling. It can sure keep one's heart racing! One of my all-time favorites, and when you read the ammount of books I do, a rating like that is hard to come by. Superb!"
3,A little caution,"Though my daughter has enjoyed this book and series byMs. Pierce, I have a couple criticisms. The vocabulary is verycomplex, sentence structure tough to read and I must say, I was unprepared for the biology and sex instruction that was embedded in the story. END"
5,One of her best,This is by far the best book in The Immortals series so far. I like how Pierce has brought us into a new setting with new characters. The events in this book are what the last two book in the series have set up- the final conflict with Cathark.Another thing I noticed is there are hints of romance between Numair and Daine that foreshadow what will come in the next book. It is very predictable that this would happen.Overall this is a very enticing book that is hard to put down once you start it. It is one of the best of Pierce's books that I have read so far.
5,GREATGREATGREAT,"This book was GREAT! I love the new setting (come on, you gotta admit that after a while Tortall gets annoying) and the new batch of characters! I love her new powers, and I have a sneaking suspicion that something is going to happen between...well, can't give anything away, so never mind. GREAT THIS BOOK!!!"
3,This was worth three stars,This book contained words that were quite excellently placed in certain order that was enjoyable to a human being's eyes.
5,Daine is visiting Carthak....,"with Numair, Alanna, Kitten, and others from Tortall. She is there to help save Emperor Ozorne's dying birds while the others are there to sign a peace treaty with the Emperor Mage. The book holds a bit of romance, LOTS of adventure, and a tad of sadness. A perfect recipe by Ms. Pierce"
4,Very well writng,"In this book, Daine a 15 year old girl goes to Carthak to heal the emperors birds and to sign a peace treaty between the two counties. Daine meets a the prince Kaddar and befriends him. After a few days Daine relizes the emperors hatred against Daine's teacher and friend, Numair. The one thing I dont like about this book is that Varice, Numair's old girfriend, pays a nighttime visit to him. Although they dont go much into that topic I still found it offensive. I recemend this book to ages 12-15."
5,"""The Immortals"" quartet is ACE","Hi! I've never been to Amazon before and was searching for the new books from Tamora Pierce when I discovered you could write book reviews. I absolutely love the Immortals quartet! Daine is a great character, and so is Numair, in fact, they're all great! (Their growing relationship is particularly interesting). I don't want to spoil any storylines for you if you haven't read them, so I won't talk about them. But if you're a teenager who likes fantasy books, or maybe one who hasn't tried them before, you'll love these! They're some of the best books I've ever read, and if you haven't read them, order them now! You won't regret it. So, kick yourself sharply and order 'Wild Magic' 'Wolf Speaker' 'The Emperor Mage' and 'Realms of the Gods' now!"
4,A Workhorse,"I just finished my first job with this saw today and I loved the results. I was struggling between the Makita 10"" slide and the 6497. My experience with Milwaukee quality & durability was the deciding factor & I believe you usually get what you pay for. This saw is easy to carry from the jobsite to the truck, mitre cuts were true to angle settings and the 15 amp motor eased through the material. This saw radiates quality construction and I like the fact there are no uneccesary bells and whistles, which usually end up broken down the road.I would like to see Milwaukee improve the accessability of the slide lock and the operation of the bevel lock handle. All in all, I am proud of my saw."
1,Not a Milwaukee Product,"I have to say that this is one Milwaukee product that truly disappoints. Rather than being built in-house in Wisconsin or at one of Milwaukee/Atlas Copco's global facilities in Germany or Sweden, this saw is contract-built for Milwaukee by a Taiwanese manufacturer, presumably Rexon. While Bosch, Craftsman, a handful of DeWalt miter saws are also made in Taiwan, they offer better value and more features for the money, particularly the Bosch products. This alleged ""Milwaukee"" doesn't offer dual-bevel, a laser guide, and appears relatively flimsy compared to the products of other manufacturers. The Milwaukee has also showed poorly in woodworking reviews of compound sliding miter saws.I would characterize this saw as of marginal quality, or in other words: ""Anything But Heavy Duty."" Give Milwaukee a call at 1-800-SawDust and let them know they can do far better."
3,It's good - but it ain't great.,"I've had my Milwaukee SCMS for about five years now, and the best thing that I can say about it is that I didn't have to pay for it - it was a gift. Like the gentleman from Brooklyn I too have had a problem with my 90 degree cuts being out of square. Also, the thumbscrew that holds the saw in place on the rail stripped out after a couple of uses. I also wish the saw was of the dual-bevel variety, and I wish that it had the ability to make dado cuts like the Makita saws do. I guess when it comes down to it I'm suffering from a bad case of Makita envy, and the only cure is to go out and buy one. It's really too bad, because I have several Milwaukee hand tools and they're all top-notch. I think Milwaukee needs to go back to the drawing board and make a few improvements to what could be a decent saw."
3,shipped back,"Milwaukee has a reputaion for making well built,well designed tools for the serious tradesman.However the sliding 10"" miter saw I ordered was sent back because the 90 degree cuts were off considerably set in the 0 degree detent and the motor head shimmied and shaked moving up and down the rails.The machine had great potential because of a sound motor and economic design.Why send this type of saw out of the factory cutting out of sqaure?Milwaukee seems to have a quality control problem with this product(there are similar complains on other sites)This order has cost my small business a lot of time and aggravation not to mention money.When I called the Milwaukee service station they had a two week turn over time.I would love to use the saw if it was working correctly,but getting it fixed was too much of a problem in NYC.The packing was minimal and might of caused some of the problems.The pride or hubris of ""MADE IN THE USA"" has been tarnished a bit for me in this experience."
4,Great Story,This was a great story but in order to enjoy the WHOLE story one must read the WHOLE story. This book is the abridged version of Colors of the Mountain. While this book grabs all the highlights if you're as nitpicky as I am I recommend you read Colors of the Mountain instead. Either is bound to give you a great tale; it's just a question of whether you want it all or just the highlights.
1,Great while it lasts,You will love this for at most 6 months. I've gone through 3 of these and 6 months is the longest one has lasted.
1,Don't waste your money,The product is over priced as most ShaperImage products are and the quality is poor. The unit will randomly activate by itself and dispence the entire soap contents until empty. SI customer service was useless when I asked for help. Don't buy this product unless you on a soap company to keep it full.
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought 3 and have exchanged each one after only about a month of use. They just keep going bad. Generally, they stop responding. They are great when they work but they just don't last longer than a month or two. My friend bought one and she had the same experience. Don't waste your money!"
3,Disappointed and Amused,"I purchased two of the Sharper Image Soap Genie Automatic Dispenser, Small, for Christmas presents. One of them works wonderful and the other one has been replaced twice. The first one stopped pumping after one week and the second one would pump and pump and pump even when no one was around. I opted for a refund on the second one since I had to go ahead and purchases gift for the disappointed recipient."
2,This is why I dislike Sharper Image,"They always have neat ideas or have nice clones of other's neat ideas. But they are always shy on delivering cos' they cheapen out in the manufacture process somehow somewhere. This Soap Genie does work, but the adjustment knob is a joke, it just squirts out whatever quantity it feels like. The fact that one can't clean the holding tank is another flaw, have they not foreseen soap scum accumulation at all? If you are lack of patience or don't want to experiment w/ various viscosity of liquid soaps, you will really hate this, like my sister does. She has stopped using hers. Look for other brands like Brookstone's & Simple Human's versions too & compare."
3,A train wreck of an album.,"Debut album from American guitarist vocalist Katherine Thomas, originally released in 1987. A mix of glam and thrash metal that stands as the total opposition to what is know as ""Thinking Man's metal"". Exaggerating vocals, childish lyrics, undisciplined guitar shredding, and very little cohesion within song arrangements. If you are very serious about your music this album is very likely to stand as an insult to your intelligence, still if you have already heard/collected just about every 80s metal record you could consider buying this. This is so ridiculous that it's almost fun.""Power Play"" magazine (issue 94) marks this album with 2/10 commenting: ""Her vocals are absolutely diabolical; her playing is sloppier than a Dutch blwjb... Avoid like the plague my friends"""
4,Refrence and Enjoyment Finally Combined,"Chicago Day at the World's Columbian Expoition has never before been so well captured than in this book. It gives you all of the information that you could need, and more. The book is illustrated with wonderful pictures of the buildings and places that were important to Chicago Day. There is also a whole section of the book that is dedicated to the night-time ceremonies of Chicago Day, and the book gives you detailed pictures and information about the floats and fireworks that were in the ceremonies. There are also pictures of the people involved in making Chicago Day happen. Along with all of these things there are statistics showing you what a record breaking day Chicago Day was. It also gives you a feel for the overall Fair, so while learning about a certain part of the Fair, you learn about the whole amazing event. All in all this book is interesting and fun to read, while educational and factual, this is a book you and your kids will both like."
2,really really poor quality photos.,"I was really disappointed with this book. Assuming the authors were working with something other than a stack of photocopies to begin with, the quality was just awful. The text was interesting, but honestly, the quality of the graphic work on the book made me doubt the amount of effort put into things like research as well. I wouldn't use this book as a source. The poster sized map of the fair was the best part of the purchase, although the photograph notes marked on it means it can't really be used for any other purpose."
4,"Good, but not quite great","The good in this dvd: there is some incredible footage that I have never seen before in any other WWII series. Some of the footage is gruesome and horrific. It makes even me turn my eyes away. There are great interviews with veterans throughout the dvd. The bad: it is not a comprehensive look at the war, it is on a narrow segment. (Combat photographers.) Tom Hank's extremely biased rant against the atomic bombs that barely acknowledges one whole side of the argument is not appreciated.Overall, this dvd is worth picking up if only for the amazing footage it contains, but also look at ""Price for Peace"" which gives a much more complete- and unbiased- account of the Pacific War."
4,"Couple of minor annoyances, but overall a solid phone","This is a great phone if you are just looking for a basic cordless. I've been very pleased with the reception quality and I like the simple, clean design without tacky, futuristic buttons that more recent models tend to have. There are a couple of things I did find annoying, however.- If your call requires a series of numbers (e.g. long distance call that has an access number followed by an actual phone number), you cannot browse the phonebook for subsequent numbers. You can still use the speed-dial feature, but you'd have to know where the desired number is stored.- The battery life is *way* too short.- The phone has this rather annoying beep for whenever any of the buttons is pressed, and there is no option to turn in off."
1,Received wrong item,"My invoice clearly states ""hardcover"" edition of book, but I received the paperback edition. I tried to get it replaced without success. If I had wanted the paperback edition, I could have ordered it for $1 less. I WANT THE HARDCOVER BOOK OR MY MONEY BACK."
2,outdated,"Although there is much practical advice and interesting facts about child development, the overall result is a tired and dated manual. Some of the advice is downright dangerous! The book explored the conflict between putting infants to sleep on their back as opposed stomach. There is a clinically accepted link between Babies sleeping on their stomach and SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrom. There isn't a pediatrition or health nurse on the planet who would recomend putiing an infant to sleep on their belly, let alone give an option between the two."
3,Outdated but interesting ...,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is a new mother. I had received a copy of the original version as a gift when my son was born 33 years ago. Even though it has been updated, the book is outdated. It is still interesting, especially to those of us from the 'old school,' though with so many changes in pediatricians' recommendations (back vs. stomach, delaying feeding whole foods, etc.), the book is not appreciated by new mothers - they are afraid to stray even a little bit from their pediatrician's advice. I can only wonder how we were able to raise such healthy and happy children! :)"
3,Okay,"I liked its book because of its great info on baby's motor development month by month. However, the information on breastfeeding was horrible... and some of it was wrong! Please don't rely on this book for advice on weaning, etc."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"Remember when you are reading this that it is 20 yrs + old and lots of the information has changed drastically since. I found some of the information useful, but please take it all with a grain of salt. For example, the author continually recommends putting baby on his stomach to sleep, refers to mom as the primary caretaker and writes about what happens when dad gets home from work and mom has to cook dinner, etc. Things have changed, so buy another more recent book in addition to double-check your facts."
5,A Delicious Treat for Readers Of All Ages!,"I discovered this sequel to the original ""Gone Away Lake"" just recently, and was surprised because I never realized it existed! Having read ""Gone Away"" as an adolescent, I was caught up in the story immediately, and always wondered what happened after the story ended. Well, now I know! In fact this sequel is just as good as the original, and actually seems like more of a continuation of the original story than a sequel. You will fall in love all over again with not only the story but the characters as well. Miss Enright just seemed to know exactly how to tell a story to hold a reader's interest and make the characters unforgettable. While written for children, these stories will also capture the imagination of adults, many of whom will remember the original story from their childhood. Kudos to Elizabeth Enright...she will be sorely missed!"
3,Saving the rainforest,"Grady is a very smart kid and because of it he is asked to spend a couple of weeks with a famous botanist. They are planing to save the forest with special trees. Grady discovers away to speak with the trees with different sounds. He finds out that the trees aren't helping the environment, they're killing it. When people figure out what grady is doing, he runs away. He camps with some indians. Grady teams up with the indians to try to save the rainforest. Can they do it, or will they fail?"
3,nice for phone numbers for children,My daughter likes hers but needs more options like better games etc.. She lost interest fast but it does have phone numbers recorded in case she needs them.
5,Perfect Flag!!!!,The product was perfect and exactly what i was looking for!!!!! Look forward to purchasing more products such as this one. Super fast shipping also
4,Swoosh!,"That's the sound the net makes!My daughter wanted this for her bday. (she just turned 16) as one of her gifts. She seems to be very pleased with it but I think it's much better suited for little ones. If she or my son were much younger, they would definitely have loved this item!"
3,Not a Butterfly collector,"Please forgive me for only rating a ""3"" but I don't plan to use this as a toy so I can't really be fair. I tried not to check any stars but the computer won't let me skip that section. Frankly, I don't collect butterflies. They are just too lovely and too few with the advent of pesticides. However, I have a problem with an occasional fly in the house and I plan to use this to catch the ones I can't coax out of the door. I don't like spraying them in the house so I hope this will work for me. Don't know if my reactions are fast enough but -- I'll find out."
5,Good Book,If you are looking for a book that will encrease your faith this book is for you. You will learn so much about the holy spirit and its function in your life.
4,very good indie electronic,"I think I should take up for this album a bit, since the other review wasn't so warm. I think this is a great piece of work that retains a very cool independent feel throughout the album. There is quite a bit of really gorgeous analogue synth work on this album and while its not that groundbreaking, it certainly is damn pretty. Don't let the deconstructive analysis fool ya...this is good music. Fans of SugarPlant and Flowchart will enjoy this immensely"
3,"Gee, Amazon, don't give TOO much away.","This is not the most informative entry I've seen. I would type the tracks, but that's not my place. They shouldn't discriminate against 228,000-ranked albums...I want a picture, tracks, and a Rolling Stone review, pronto!This is a good album, but nothing more. It's only 45 minutes, and unless you're Prodigy or the Chemical Brothers (with their now blind following), an unknown selection of that length just won't compete. That's a shame, too; this album had potential. It's quite electronic, opting for waves over beeps (let alone ""big, dirty beats"" for that matter). What results is a very mellow album that falls short of excellence. The melodies are simple but not uncompelling. My favorites are 1,2,8,9 (respectively) ""3 intro 1"", ""Tinfoil Cloud"", ""Escaping the Game Grid"", ""The Lab"", and ""Blue Orange Yellow"" which uses a guitar, but not particularly well. One could do worse, but also quite a lot better."

Immediately engages the reader...","""A FASCINATING ENTRÉE into the mind of Michael Van Allen, who has undergone a nervous breakdown during a performance by his famous father of Scriabin's Piano Sonata No. 5.

4,Love those HOODOO's,Loved 'em when they were playing and love their album. Wish that they were still playing around here. Have Glen Walters solo album.
3,Loved them Devils,"Ya, I was one of the fortunate ones. Loved the band and went to see them whenever they played. Long branch, Keystone, Golden Gate Park, Realto Rodeo. Great funky music with a hell of a fun upbeat sound. We used to dance at all their shows. You would have to be careful if you got too close to the stage since the Sax player had a liquid fuel line connected to his Sax and would blow flames a couple of feet out of it often! Bless You Guys. Hope in to see some HooDoo Re-Release to CD soon. They were a dynamic hi fidelity horn play-in band. Give me the .WAV!Cosworth"
4,Blast from the Past,"You gotta love the name of this group, very creative. I bought this CD because I like Joe Crane's music. Some of the tracks still sound fresh but most would sound way better if you had too much too drink (or smoke), were 22 years old and in a bar in San Francisco. I imagine under those conditions, this group really rocked. My favorites: ""Greenlight"", ""You Gotta Get You Somebody New"" and ""Safecracker"". Worth buying for those three tunes. Having the Pointer Sisters singing backup on ""Sea of Love"" is a very cool touch as well. The sound quality is very good ... in these days of highly engineered music, this CD sounds like you're right in the room with the band. Now where did I put my bellbottoms and my bong?"
5,A nice little bag.,"I got this bag for day trips with my new Olympus Pen 4/3 camera. The camera with it's kit telephoto lens and shoulder strap fit snuggly inside the main compartment. On the front there is a pouch which nicely holds the ""pancake lens"" for the camera. Inside the top cover is a mesh ( see thru ) zippered pocket which is perfect for storing a couple of extra batteries and memory cards.The top cover has a zippered closure plus the front flap on the top cover has the snap/latch which also covers the front zipper pocket for added safety. The bag is nicely padded so it protects the camera well. The handle on the top makes it easy to pick it up quickly without having to noodle around with the shoulder strap.Nicely done, Vanguard!"
5,Another fantastical tale by a master story teller,"Simon Green just keeps turning out the best urban fantasy in years.When pitted against angels of both the higher kind, and the lower sort, John Taylor again comes through, while wondering if he can handle the mess.The angels are scary as heck, followed closely by Suzie Shooter and the host of unusual types Taylor associates with in the Nightside.Great stuff, well-written. As creative as it comes, with chuckle-out-loud dialogue and colorful descriptions of Taylor's dark world."
5,Awesome follow-up!,"Great work! This book as every bit as good as the first one. One of the things I admire most about this series by Green is this ability to make a book out of a series stand by itself. You can literally read any book in the series and not get lost because you ""missed something"" by not having read the previous books. In fact, I read the fourth book first, not knowing it was part of a series and it got me hooked right away.If you like Sci Fi, Horror, and Detective stories, by all means, read it."
4,Even better than the first book,"This is the second book Simon has written that is set in the ""Nightside"", a city that exists parallel to London and has fantastic, magical, and vile beings living in it. This book explores much more of ""Nightside"" than the first book and furthers the mystery of Simon's mother. The plot is intriguing and well done.You should be able to read this book in one sitting (if you have two or so hours to spend) as it is a short book much like it's predecessor but it is also a great read, much like the first one. I highly recommend it and hope there are many more in this series."
3,Better than the first,"I thought this second book in the series was much stronger than the first. The first had altogether too much world-building, but this time we get right to the meat of the story. The Unholy Grail (a cup that Judas drank from that grants its holder great power) is supposedly on the loose in the Nightside, and everyone knows about it. Including the Angels, both from above and below. Taylor is brought in to find it -- hopefully before the Angels tear the Nightside to pieces.Since this is a YA book, it's a relatively quick read. I felt more connected to Taylor and his unusual associates this time around, and will likely continue with the series."
4,Great Follow-up,"The Nightside books center on John Taylor, a private investigator who has special abilities that help him find things in a dark, magical place called the Nightside.In the second book, Agents of Light and Darkness, the Nightside is already exposed to us, so Green can concentrate more on the plot, meanwhile still introducing new, creepy places within the city. A mysterious monk comes to John to ask him to find the Unholy Grail. Angels, demons, and everyone else dangerous seems to be searching for it as well. John teams up with Shotgun Suzie, a deadly assassin who once tried to kill him, for this disturbing tale.I love how these are written in a sort of classic pulp fiction detective novel, yet very fresh and fun."
4,Read Dresdaen first,"If you are done with the Harry Dresden series this is worth the time, otherwise read Dresden."
3,In Nightside...,"Agents of Light and Darkness was not as good as the first book in the series. Though I liked the idea and finish of the story a lot more this time I found John's constant need to remind us how life is like in Nightside tiring. We get it, people come to Nightside to do bad things, it's dark, it's full of neon lights, you can't trust people, blah blah blah. One should not repeat themselves so much in such a short novel.I did like that we got to learn a lot more about Suzie and Merlin. He did flush out multiple characters a lot more but Walker and he Collector they might as well have copied and pasted the information from the previous book.All in all loved the store and disliked the writing. Still going to read the third book though."
4,Excellent Follow Up Book,"In this second volume in Simon Green's The Nightside tales, investigator John Taylor is back in his old haunting grounds, finding things and this time around he is on a grail hunt, with a twist. Taylor is looking for the Unholy Grail, the Judas Cup...a cup of both ultimate power and corruption.Taylor learns that the Unholy Grail maybe nearby and is hired to find it. The cup is sought by powerful and dangerous beings, among them are Angels, both the High and the Fallen. The downside to Taylor's gift is that whenever he uses his talent for finding things, it alerts others to his whereabouts. Therefore, he must use all of his experience, skills, and reputation to stay alive while trying to find the Grail.Agents of Light and Darkness is an excellent sequel, it offered more insight into protagonist John Taylor and the history of The Nightside. Very nicely done."
3,IT HAS TEETH! :(,"Cute doll, sorta. In the product image above, the doll looks BEAUTIFUL, but when I received it in the mail, it was a HUGE disappointment... The doll came smelling like vanilla, except with a hint of spoiled hard-boiled egg. Overall a cute doll except it has teeth. It is a tiny newborn doll with ugly, yellow teeth. Not easy to get rid of. Don't buy."
3,small,This is a very small baby doll.It looks cute but it is not as big as u see the picture.It may be good for 1 yr old or 2 yrs old child.
2,"A ""BABY"" doll with Teeth?","The doll I received is not nearly as lovely as the photo. The picture shows a beautiful soft faced girly dolls. Mine wasn't nearly as soft and sweet looking and had two painted on front teeth! They look horrid. Why oh why would they produce a newborn baby with teeth? The vanilla scent was there but again not as yummy as other reviewers had found it to be. We have a Melissa & Doug 12"" Jenna dolly and she is so much sweeter looking that this Calin doll. Everyone said to me look at Carolle for your daughters first baby as they are a wonderful but sadly this model is not. I have purchased many of their dolls clothes (as they fit the Melissa and Dough doll beautifully) and have been extremely happy with them in terms of quality and aesthetics."
3,MAde in China,I was looking for a baby doll made in the USA. This item came up in the search. But it is made in China. Very cute doll but not USA made as I wanted. No packing slip in the box so it's tuff to return
3,"Designed in France, but made in China","Overall, I was not impressed by this doll. The plastic is hard, not ""soft to the touch"" as described. The face is not as cute as the picture either. The one we received has a lazy eye and two teeth that you can't see in the photo. It's also made in China just like all the other dolls you'll find at Target or Walmart, so I'm not sure how they justify the $30 price tag. My daughter shows no interest in Calin although she likes to play with other dolls... perhaps she'll like it more when she's older. If I hadn't thrown away the packaging, I would return this doll and purchase a different one for half the price."
3,This was bought as a Christmas gift for a niece.,"I was given several suggestions as to what to purchase for my niece and, among the many choices, I chose this toy.I have no other opinions regarding this item."
5,perfect doll,My daughter's eyes lit up when she opened this doll for her second birthday. Fantastic toy all around!
5,DAUGHTERS FIRST DOLL,MY 19 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WILL LOVE THIS DOLL FOR CHRISTMAS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER OPEN IT UP FROM SANTA!!
3,not as pictured,Doll- great. Clothes- great. Very disappointed that the chair was not included. The photo is misleading and should be changed.
5,Perfect First Baby,"This is the perfect baby for a 2 yr old. It has soft hands,feet and body. It also has movable eyes and is the perfect size for a little child to carry around. The reaction of my neice was exactly what I was looking for."
5,Love this doll,"My granddaughter is now almost 4 and carried this doll around for the better part of 3 years. She has just now started leaving her behind sometimes, but for awhile had to take her everywhere. I got this doll for her as a baby and it quickly became her favorite. She named her Mimi and carried poor Mimi everywhere with her. She cleans up beautifully, but due to serious loving by a 2-3 year old, we have had to replace her clothing frequently. The original clothing washed well a few times, but then it just wore out. We were able to find inexpensive replacement clothing at Walmart that fit well and was more ""disposable"" than the expensive clothing sold for this doll. The doll itself has been washed numerous times and has held up really well."
5,very nice,"This was a gift for my niece, and was her first doll. It has the nicest face I have been able to find in stores and online, and the soft body was what I was looking for. My niece and my sister liked the doll a lot, and she smells lightly of a pretty scent. Good first doll."
4,Great doll for a toddler!,"I bought this doll for my daughter's second birthday. I also bought a Corolle Mini Calin doll for her first birthday, which is smaller - too small. This doll is the perfect size and weight for her. She plays with it almost every day -she feeds her and likes to sleep with her. The doll is adorable - she has a pretty face and my daughter loves that her eyes that open and close. Overall the quality is very good. My only complaint is that the fabric used for the outfit is cheap. It pills very easily and I'm not sure how well it will hold up when washed over time."
4,"Cute babydoll, but you could probably buy a cheaper one and be just as happy","My daughter LOVES her baby. It is cute, looks lifelike, and the beanbag torso makes it floppy and cuddly like a real baby. The eyes close when you lie it down (if you couldn't tell) and it smells kind of like vanilla. The outfit is cute, too. Here is my analysis of this particular doll:Pros:-------- Good size for a young toddler (my daughter is 18 months)- Beanbag torso is nice with the lifelike limbs and head. Makes it both cuddly and realistic looking- Smells nice- Cute outfit- Eyes open and closeCons:-------- Pretty pricey - I think she would have been happy with something significantly cheaper- The hat is very difficult to put on, but very easy to take off. Mommy and Daddy will have to put it on repeatedly as I'm not sure any young child could do it."
5,Corolle doll,This is a beautiful doll. Fourteen month grand daughter liked it. Plastic smell was a little strong. Arrived quicker than expected.
2,Sleepy time,"I really did not find this sensual at all. It is the basic massage steps that i do now as a therapist just without draping. I really wished i would have saved my money this is not worth it for sensuality, if you want to learn how to massage then buy it."
3,Just OK,"The video does give good pointers, but it's pretty boring. They should of hired someone else to do the talking."
3,=/ Ok.,"Not a bad movie, but not great. Fast forwarded through most of it. Would've liked it to be a bit more raunchy, but I understand it is supposed to be ""educational""."
2,Typical Massage except naked,"This demonstration is no different then a typical massage demonstration except the models are naked. The narrator has the same scientific droning tone as Ben Stein (from the dry eyes commercials of the 90's) I wish I did not buy this for our 9 year anniversary and just stuck with the same one we have at home instead, Joy of Erotic Massage which really brings out the differences between couples massage and just a typical massage. Also the entire Sensual Massage Made Simple film is accompanied by the same three chords of bass jazz over and over and over again which made us feel more like we were at a cheesy coffee shop than a relaxing massage setting.All in all, some what informative, but very boring."
1,"Average massage, horrible DVD","I am a professional Chiang Mai Style masseur, and I wanted to try something new with my partner, so I decided to buy this DVD because of the good reviews. Unfortunately, I found that the only reliable review was the one by Ms Jennifer Navolis.- Don't expect ""sensual massage"" techniques here. It is a very average massage, the only difference is that the (not particularly attractive) models are naked- The narrator voice is unbearable- The music is abominable. Really. And way too loud. No music at all would have been far betterAlso, some of these techniques, in particular the ones involving the knee and the lower back, can be pretty dangerous on your partner if you don't have some professional knowledge.So, kudos to Jennifer for the very honest review; but I would say that she has been too kind to give this DVD two stars. I would give zero if I could."
4,Great for Couples!,"My fiancé and I really enjoyed viewing this video to help us learn more massage techniques for each other. I would recommend this video for any couple that are beginners and looking for a romantic night together. We at first rented, but now we are looking at purchasing it now."
4,love this book,I've been looking for this book for a number of years but it was out of print(which was a big disappointment). If you are interested in paper sculpture this is a great resource. I've already been inspired to create some 3-dimensional cards with ideas from this book.
2,Not for me,"This product, which says is good for rosacea skin types, is a really deep rust color, it actually makes rosacea skin look worse. Also, it contains nickel in the ingredients, which is a common allergen. I tried it once and am going to give it away, since it doesn't go well with my complexion. When purchasing this product, I was confused as to the color. I thought it would be a natural beige color, more like foundation, since it says all purpose makeup. I used the word ""natural foundation"" when searching and this product popped up - so I guess it was a little misleading."
5,An audiophile masterpiece.,The best souding SACD i have ever purchase.If you have a state of the art SACD surround system that can split Stereo into Multichannel Surround..you will be blown away by this disc..and it also sounds amazing in stereo with or without SACD decoding...get it now.
2,"Wanted only the Theme, but got More","This purchase was another customer error. I wanted only the Theme from SHAFT. I downloaded the whole album and was disappointed. Nothing wrong with the download or the product, but I should have listened to more of the samples before ordering. I love a lot of Isaac Hayes music, but this is not my favorite. As they say when you buy a new car, ""...your mileage may vary."""
4,The best deal ever!,"This KENWOOD 5-Channel amplifier is by far the very best price for a very good quality piece of equipment. KENWOOD is a brand that has been around for many years and AMAZON is one of the only websites i have seen offering [such] a great deal, so buy now im sure u'll be happy"
5,Illuminating for Inner Transformation + Exceptional Read,"The guidance in Know Yourself is simultaneously spiritually illuminating and immediately helpful for transforming self-sabotaging patterns, while renewing the mind with insights that are enlightening.The book is exceptionally well written with deep insight spanning the stages from birth through adulthood, along with simple yet perceptive exercises that will awaken your inherent self worth. I found this to be an enormously delightful read, as well as an astutely beneficial book for the inner confidence both I and so many have searched for.The transformative illumination + spiritual and enormously helpful practical insight, make this book truly deserving of five stars."
1,the first book I ever threw away (in my recycling),"I'm sorry but I found this book extremely unhelpful. It was very disjointed. It wasn't even clear what you were supposed to be writing in the workbook pages. It just seemed like a stream of consciousness of trite phrases like ""everything happens for a reason"". Maybe it's helpful to people who have never thought beyond their nose for their entire life. I don't know. I couldn't find anything redeeming in the entire thing. I ended up just skimming the second half so maybe there was something redeeming in there."
5,Helps my curls,I use this solution when my perm is ready to be redone.It really seems to help rejuvinate what it left. I have been using this product for a while and feel it is really worth the price
1,Defective on Delivery,Got this TV combo delivered today. The DVD tray wouldnt even open the first time! Mechanical defect...Looks like Apex doesnt even do proper quality assurance. Now I to go through the hassle of repacking it and returning it thru UPS. AVOID!
1,Why didn't I read these reviews before buying,"Well, I guess I too was taken. Nine months of use and the DVD quits turning or reading the disc. Called APEX for a local service center location and they want me to return it to California at my expense and pay them an $80 service fee. By the time I do this I will have nearly the price of the unit paid again. I should have gotten the 3 year extended warranty. I'll get separate components next time from a name that is well known.I can get service here for $30 and most likely the DVD reader is only about $40."
2,poorly designed,"I was really disappointed with the newest Thailand edition to the Lonely Planet series. This is a huge volume and is more a history lesson then a guidebook. Learning the history of your destination is great but that information is not necessary when carrying around a guide to find a place to eat. Many of the authors' recommendations are already outdated. The price ranges for places to eat or sleep are not accurate or sometimes not given at all. My main problem is the way this guide links the map to the text. In order to find out where a place is located, you must refer to several different pages when reading the map. Why can't the description of a restaurant also tell the map page and grid point without having to look on a separate index? Poorly designed and not easy to use when on the go. Keep this one on your bookshelf and take a smaller guidebook when traveling. I recommend the Time Out series as my favorite."
2,Disappointing Book - Skimpy Details,"I was disappointed with this Lonely Planet book. I bought this guidebook because it was the most up-to-date. In general, I found the descriptions of hostels and hotels and restaurants to be so skimpy as to be completely unhelpful to the reader. The descriptions of the sights was less skimpy but still unsatisfying. I also brought along a Rough Guides guidebook. While it was a few years older than Lonely Planet, its descriptions were far superior. Buy the Rough Guides instead of the Lonely Planet."
5,This is the best book I've ever seen on Thailand.,"If you plan to head to Thailand, just bring this book, some money, and some clothes and you'll be set. This book changed and saved my life. Thank you, China Williams! Words fail me when I think of all this book has been done for me, but I'm glad they never fail China and her crew. Imagine mixing Paul Theroux with the Upanishads and you have this latest edition of LP Thailand! Each page is infused with wisdom, wit, and humor."
3,Good but could have been better,Its a good book and a worth while read but the flow of the book is different to other lonely planet books I have had.
1,Type is ridiculously small - DO NOT BUY,This book appears to contain the compendium of knowledge regarding Thailand. Too bad the font is so small that even my teenage daughter says it hurts her eyes. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you want to use a magnifying glass to read it. Very disappointed.
1,Look to another guidebook,Poorly organized. Missing a lot of information on Koh Samui. It recommends taking a bus/ferry combo there and quotes a really low price and then does not say how to get that price. I had a lot of trouble using this guide and will be getting a different one for next time.
3,Not comprehensive,"This book assisted with our many trips to Thailand. It is fairly detailed for shopping and locating the main shopping mall. However, for bar/night life, you should try to find another book. You can get into alot of trouble in Thailand at night and this book does not cover it well for tourist."
4,Good,Expected more up to date version of book which is what I selected so a bit disappointed. Book still useful.
1,A mistake to travel with Kindle edition.,"Don't try to travel with the Kindle version of this guidebook. It's unbelievably frustrating to navigate, plus the maps get blurry when you blow them up to try and capture the detail. I think I've given up on guidebooks anyway. They all seem to be outdated before they're even published. Better to carry a tablet and rely on up-to-the-minute user-generated review sites."
2,Kindle Edition: A Major Headache,I was excited to have an e-version on my iPhone for travelling but I found myself wishing I had a hard copy once I was in Thailand. While all of the useful Lonely Planet info is in there - it is so hard to find in the Kindle Edition.There is a linked table of contents but overall I found navigating very difficult.The maps were especially painful. Maybe it was too much to expect an integrated google map but the way the maps are sliced and diced makes it especially hard to follow or find anything.Conclusion: I'll stick to the hard copies for now.
1,Quantity but no quality,"What a vast book. But what lack of discernment.We were directed to a whorehouse insetad of a nightclub, a number of cockroach and mould infested dives instead of 'clean' (a ubiquitous adjective in this book) budget hotels.We also fell victimn to Joe Cummings's apparent hidden commercial agenda - he seems to want to appeal to all tourist tastes, dishing out very dubious information on the Thai sex industry, assuring us that it is no worse than the U.S or India whilst directing us to traditional massage places in Bangkok offering far more than massages. He also tries to make out that Pattaya is not merely a sex resort.Worst of all is the tone. Much of the information is communicated in a pompous style that says as much about the author's high opinion of himself as it does about Thailand.After a number of disappointments we have now switched to more considered guide book series from Cadogan or Footprint."
3,Not as good as other LP Guides,"I have been an LP fan for several years, primarily based on the European guide books. However, I was quite disappointed with the poor organization of the content. It was always confusing to located the information I was seeking. The maps were also not to scale, which can be quite misleading in Bangkok where the city blocks are very, very long. I would look for a better book for Thailand...at least until its next revision."
3,"Not bad, could be better","Basically, my main complaint is that they took out the good stuff from the old edition and replace them with irrelevant stuff.One example would be in the last edition, they had a section with color pictures of different types of food served in Thailand, something I find interesting to note when traveling to a foreign country. They replaced this section with a section with picture of people riding on elephants and scenery that don't really tell you much.The reason why I did not give them too bad of a rating is that the information is pretty much the same between the two editions. In this edition, there is less information on border crossings, but that is due to increase safety concerns (so I can understand why they did that). I would still recommend the last edition. Besides being cheaper, you actually learn a little bit more."
2,not an easy reference,"We brought this book to Chiang Mai, and it usually left us confused or frustrated because it took AGES to find anything useful. I personally don't think it is well organized. The maps are hard to read and decipher. I have to go through tons of words before I get to what I want and then later find out that the map doesn't really show me clearly how to get there.I have used other LP guide books in the past with more success, and this one is very disappointing.You're better off getting another guide book that is more user friendly or buying a local map."
5,Something for all styles,"I love Lonely Planet guides and in going to Thailand this book was very helpful. I had a slightly earlier version of this book but loved the ease it made in booking train tickets and traveling in the north, but admittedly a lot of my time was in Bangkok. What I did find useful was the maps and suggestions for touring around the city and using the water taxis there - how brilliant.If you are going to Thailand as a veteran traveler you may be excused for opting out as you know very well if you are the type to be influenced and supported by guide books. If this is your first time to Thailand and are not that experienced overseas I would absolutely recommend this gem.You will find out how to get around the region if this is your goal, around the nation if this is your goal, or simply around the main city. Something for all styles."
5,Very informative,"I grew up in Bkk from 1973-1983 and have been back to visit numerous times. This upcoming trip will be the ""tourist"" trip as I will be taking my new in-laws and fiance on a trip, so I thought I should at least know more about Thailand. The book has been a very good read from the start and I have learned more about the cultures from the book than what my own family tells me. I am reading this book daily and there's a lot to be taken in, great job on the material. Well written, good content, thorough and insightful. I am traveling in a week and will be reading this on the plane as well. I strongly recommend the book to anyone thinking of going to Thailand or planning a visit."
2,Surprisingly mediocre,"I really expected more from this book. It had basic info about lodging and food, but really quite basic and obvious stuff. I was frustrated many times looking for places to eat. The section on Koh Samui was almost totally useless. There was nothing here to make it worth the price."
1,Moore needs to write for somebody else.,"I knew this book was going to turn out terrible when I found out that Vance Moore wrote it. One good habit this guy has when writing books is he mentions things at the beginning of the book (the Mirari in Chapter 1 which strikes Kamahl's fancy as final prize) and doesn't mention it hardly ever again until the last three or four chapters (when you finally figure out it's called the Mirari!). The only thing that's good about this book is the fact that it's the only one in the Odyssey cycle written by Moore. I'm in the middle of Chainer's Torment right now, and it is already looking 10 times better than this book ever could be.Ignore this author like the Phyrexian Plague!"
1,Like walking through quicksand,"I've read all the other books in the Magic series, and up till this one they were extremely well written. From Rath and Storm till Apocalypse I couldn't put the books down. Till I hit this book. I just hit a brick wall it feels like. I can't force myself to read on and I have about 100 pages left in the book. It's so dry and unexciting to me. The whole thing is about Kamahl a barbarian chasing after this artifact (The Mirari) and Laquatus, a mer-ambassador also seeking the Mirari and that's about all there is to the book. The Gerrard storyline should have continued, even though I know what happened in Apocalypse and all, they could have continued with the crew. I would not recommend these new ""environment"" style books they are trying with now."
4,Nice thermometer,"I really appreciated the colors and somewhat larger numbers, because I'm normally trying to look at it from the pool or from my kitchen window (we have it hanging on the patio outside). Only had it for 3 mos so far, and I like it. I think it runs maybe a degree or two higher than normal, but I'm going to see how it does during the summer with our 100+ degree days, and I'll post again to let you know how it survived!"
1,accu WRONG,"its called the accurite, but it just is plain wrong. i tested it indoors - inside a airconditioned room, 69 degrees, every thermostat says so, so it tells us 82 degrees.cant see if theres any switch to turn because there are no instructions anyway.returning it immediately.USELESS."
1,Acu-WRONG!,"If I still had the original packaging, this would be going back. Its so far off the correct temperature, its ridiculous! I hung it in our patio and its always showing the temperature between 20 and 40 degrees. Its NOT that cold here in Arizona!"
3,Disapointed,I was disapointed that the thermometer was not all that easy to read dispite its size. I think maybe it was because of the colors.
1,Thermometer not working,"I received the Chaney Instrument 11-Inch Thermometer/Hygrometer Combo in a very short time. I took it out of the box and noticed that the humidity gage was working, but the temperature indicator was on 'zero'.I let it sit overnight, and checked it in the morning. The temperature indicator was still on 'zero'. I am returning the item in hopes I can get another one that is working."
1,"Always read 75-80 degree not matter what,","even when I moved it by the open window when the outside temperature was 60. The hygrometer reading does move around more, from 40-60%, but I have not verified it."
2,Colorful to begin with...,"We bought this in mid June and loved how bright the numbers were. You could see them from across the yard. We hung it on our fence, which only gets sun for part of the day. It is now late August and all of the red numbers have disappeared. You have to stand very close to it to see anything. And the green is quickly fading as well. As far as telling you the temp, it works well. But, it is pointless when you can't see the numbers. I would not waste my money on this."
3,Chaney Instrument 11-Inch Thermometer/Hygrometer Combo,Not quite as accurate as my digital weather station both in measuring temperature and humity.Needs to be left in the enviorment for at least 8hrs before fidling with re-calibrating it for more accurate readings.This unit has a nice combo of for those looking for only temperature and humity with no clock.Love the color schemes used for both dials.
3,OK if kept out of sun,"You cannot place this device in direct sunlight. The red fades immediately and it maxes the needle out. However, it looks nice on our porch in the shade and I like to check the humidity as well as the temperature. I recommend it because it goes up to 130 degrees and even though we had over 120 degrees once in 2006, our other thermometers didn't go that high."
3,No instructions on calibration,"I bought two and they have been hanging on the wall side by side for two days now. The two are within a couple of degrees of each other for temperature which is good enough for my use. But the humidity reading between the two is ten percent different so one (or both) has to be wrong. If I could figure out how to calibrate the humidity dial this would be fine with me since I figure you get some jarring and such during shipping which might throw it off. But there were no instructions in the box and the instructions on the back of the box were for how to set a clock and insert a battery (which this unit does not even use). So the humidity dial is worthless to me unless I can figure out the calibration. The unit is, however, very attractive and just what I wanted in appearance and the temperature does work fine so it gets a medium rating from me. I would have given it top rating if there were instructions for calibrating the humidity reading."
1,pitiful,This thermometer is a complete joke. Have never seen anything like it. All reviews that I read said it was so accurate. I can tell you with certainty that there is no way the humidity in Houston Texas is 20% on July 30th. Thats all that I needed to see before I sent it back.
3,It's hot out there!,"Having tried and given up on electronic wireless solutions, we got this thermometer to put in our greenhouse so we could tell the temperature there from inside the house. It works OK for that, however the temperature isn't that accurate. It also has a hygrometer so we know the humidity too. The only problem is that the the colored numbers and scales on the thermometer fade in the sun and now that I've had this a while, it is impossible to read."
3,attractive,"I'm using this indoors in my wine cellar. I thought for the price a very good piece. I did have to set it in for a few days before I adjusted it, the colors are nice and bright, it's a big display, overall a good purchase."
2,Hard to adjust temp,"No matter how hard we try, still hard to set the temp..not a good product in my way of thinking. I use a digital temp and humidity on wireless for the greenhouse to compare...find something else if you can..but...it looks great"
2,"Pretty, but not for long","If anyone has seen the movie ""Hoosiers,"" they know they amount of sunlight we get during the winter in the Midwest. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad. He installed it in a rather shady area within a week of Christmas. The red was faded before the middle of January. I bought it so it would be easy for my grandpa or dad to read it (or get an idea of the temp) while driving into the lot. Now they can only easily tell the temp if it is really hot. Even the green is fading into a light yellow that is hard to read. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it still works and was good looking in the beginning."
2,Shipping,"I found this exact thermometer at Wal-Mart for $10.00, a selling amount less than I paid for shipping. I would like my shipping refunded."
2,Faded Fast,"I bought this for my husband to replace our old fading outdoor thermometer, only to have the red numbers of this one fade within weeks. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"Nice, until you can't read the face !!!!","The thermometer works fine, but within 5 months the face is faded out to the point that 90 deg. and above is a very light pink, the green area is a light blue. The same goes for the hygrometer. Yes, this unit gets a little morning sun, but no afternoon sun. I would not buy this unit again due to the fading."
2,Almost a great thermometer,"I've owned one of these before and was very pleased with it. However, this version came to me with the hygrometer needle pegged at over 100%. With no enclosed instructions and not wanting to mess with the hassle of shipping it back I discovered an opening behind the hygrometer and began tinkering with the meter in an attempt to calibrate the device. After getting a humidity observation from a local weather report, I was able to use a small screwdriver to turn the meter to the correct reading and now all is well. Since I'm an engineer this calibration technique did not pose much of a problem, but I think it may be too much for the average bear to tackle."
1,Imagine the worst....and be ready to have your expectations exceeded.,It could not get any worse. This thing faded and warped in no time. Perfectly useless and unreadable. The only nice thing I can say is that it did not set anything on fire.
3,Thermometer - Hygrometer combo,"This is a great product, we bought two of them (they agree with each other - I assume they are accurate) We are using them to monitor the temp and humidity in our house. We heat with wood in the winter and have had some mold problems in the summer. We bought a dehumidifier to combat the mold, but I wanted to know how the temp and humidity varied throughout the house.For the price, these are a great buy and a good product"
5,An honorable remake of a dance classic,This remake of We Are Family is truly the best I've heard. I'm sure a big reason it is so well done is because one of the original writers and producers of the song did this remake. You should definitely buy this song if for no other reason than the fact that a portion of the purchase price goes to help the victims of September 11.
2,oh,"good sound, but there is no instrumental version and i could not play it in my comp.... its just me or someone have same problem?"
4,R. D. Laing is good,"In particular, I endorse the back cover of another of his books, where it says that schizophrenics constantly try to escape because they perceive it is impossible to fulfill their needs. He stated it in a better way, of course; this is just how I remember it."
2,Does not go into enough detail on any specifics....,"This book goes over a few strategies but does not get into the nuts and bolts of how to actually do anything.I only learned one thing that I did not know previously before, and most of this stuff is free.I was dissapointed in this book, but at least I least I learned one thing..."
1,What a Joke!,"All I can say is that unless you didn't graduate from high school DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this book! What a joke!!Trust me, there are WAY BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE on this subject than this generically written, poorly edited P.O.S! I'm just glad I didn't actually buy this book myself or I would have been really mad that I actually allowed this uneducated hypster a chance to profit off of me.No doubt the author has used his hypester ways to give himself so many good reviews! Otherwise, if those are honest reviews from honest people...go back and finish high school. You might be able to see all of the poor grammar and spelling mistakes after that."
4,Great primer on the basics of internet marketing,"If you are a well read experienced internet marketer then this book is NOT for you! But what it does, it does well for a nominal price. The basic concepts of listing building and marketing is covered, but there is a lot left out. And that is understandable considering the debth of knowlege needed to be a successful internet marketer.For what it is, it pretty good; although I would agree with other posting that this is just one long sales letter trying to get you purchase the next product. But would you expect less from someone who's job is to be a marketer in the business?"
1,not what I thought,"This is not what I thought it was. I purchased this tip thinking It was smaller than Wilton #1 size tip, since it was described as a number 0 tip. I needed it for small writing with royal icing, and instead it is actually a number 800 tip. It's huge! Probably used for piping cakes. too much trouble to go to the post office and paid to mail it back. I wish they were more clear on the description."
1,Save your money,"9.19.12OK, I gave this a serious try and it simply did not happen. There is one, maybe two good songs but based on other music options to ""relax"" this did not hit the spot. I originally heard Relax on Pandora and thought I would give Volume 1 and Volume 2 a try. I will not be buying Volume 3. In short, save your money. Sorry Blank & Jones"
2,Only bought it because I had to...,"Had to buy this for school. The ONLY reason I bought it. As a paralegal that has worked in a law office for 18 years, I found it boring. Its written for those just beginning their career."
2,Tight!,Quality is good but is tight and seems to run small in size. 5'2 and wear size 8 jeans I ordereda large and its very tight. Wanted to exchange it but apparently there is a $7 fee to do so. Guess Im stuck with it.
3,Too small,"I ordered according to the size chart but it's uncomfortably small, so buy a size larger and you'll be fine. Other than that this leotard is great."
4,nice and easy,I wanted something to wear under a shirt and of I get hot I can takeoff my otter shirt and I still look good
2,eh.,"the fit is so weird, the straps kept falling off of my shoulders. however the material wasn't too cheap and it was for a beginner ballet class so i guess you get your money's worth."
4,"Very comfortable, affordable leotard","I have the black tank cut in size large. Its a little tight in the shoulders, but honestly I think that it gives chest support so that's ok. I'm 5'6 and 145lbs; so I would say this item may run slightly small. Item seemed high quality fabric and well-made. Item seems to hold shape after full day of wear."
1,Super mom,"I wasn't very happy with this product, because it wasn't the product I was expecting. But I will still trying new ones."
4,Analysis in practice,"This is the second release from some of the key SANS GIAC folk and is a fine addition as it extends on the data from ""Network Intrusion Detection : An Analysts Handbook"", to give intrusion detection practitioners some interesting detects from the GIAC graduates.Included in these detects are some of the more unique pieces of analysis that have been performed at GIAC, with detailed write-ups of the analysis process and the logic applied in defining the conditions in which the events occured.Once again, this is easy and interesting reading which will appeal to intrusion analyists of all levels. Further, this book gives neophytes a real sense of what can be monitered and how important intrusion detection is in security layering."
3,"Decent companion to Network Intrusion Detection, 2nd Ed.","""Intrusion Signatures and Analysis"" is a handy companion volume to ""Network Intrusion Detection, 2nd Ed."" that gives the reader many more examples of intrusion attempts and scans across a wide variety of network devices that a real-world analyst will be required to use, and gives the reader access to more real-world events to learn from before they encounter them on their own networks.This book also serves well as a style guide for writing up incidents in your organization, or to submit to an incident response center."
5,Pithy and Pertinent,"What a valuable -- and easy -- read. Anyone trying to get their life to better align with personal goals should read this book carefully. Capp manages to bring personal growth strategies and solutions into focus while being extremely entertaining. As a business person, it was especially poignant for me. A perfect carry-on for air travel."
4,DONT BUY THIS FOR LEVER ACTION,"This fits great for the single shot rossi rifles, but get the LEVER ACTION one for the M92's or it won't fit due to the tapper of the barrel."
2,Orginally I didn't like this book...,"On my first reading, I didn't get into of all the anatomy discussions. But now after a reread and after doing some exercises and thinking about the mechanics of the voice I realize the importance of these discussions... I have learned a lot from this book and am hopeful I'll finally be able to improve my voice.I'd rate this book as a 4 star, but I don't see how to edit my original rating."
3,"Lots of details, amature presentation","This was the first book I read and now I've been singing for two years. This book has a ton of information about your body and the physics of your voice. There is no professional feel to the book at all. It has huge print and goofey pictures. It reminded me of reading in elementary school. I couldn't get the feeling that mark had actually trained pros. Instead I got the feeling that he was just a poor vocal instructor working in a guitar shop or something that decided to put together a book of all he knew. Don't get me wrong, he seems to know a good deal and there's lots of information. I did walk away from the book having more confidence singing then before. I would hope the're are better books available for aspiring singers. Definitly buy this book if you need to know how to protect your voice from damage."
4,It surprised me!!!!!!!!!,"I was a little bit worried about the negative reviews, but more moved by the positive ones and I am glad I did!!!!!!! Since I got the book I have performed 2 times and everyone has commented on how well my vocals sound thru on our mix and how my vocal range has improved. Now I am sure you will not like a lot of things this book tells you because I didnt either but its the truth, and the truth hurts. But once you get past that and tell yourself you bought the book to actually apply what it says, you will not only respect it but also love it. BUY IT ONLY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO APPLY IT!!!! If you are the kind of person that goes to the doctor and he gives you specific instructions and you dont follow them this book is not for you. Now I have to admit I have not full blown adhered to it yet but the things I am applying really work and this drives me to follow it more!"
4,Big but can make work,"like everyone else has said, the straps on the backpack wont go small enough to fit my dog. I can make it work though. I'm going to cut and sew the straps near the backpack shorter so the pack will stay tight on my dogs back. Also I'm going to cut and sew the extra part of the strap shorter so that the excess doesn't drag on the ground when he walks.My dog is 14 pounds and 15 inches tall, I dont know his girth because I never measured but he needs about two inches taken off the adjustable straps.We haven't tried the pack on a hike yet. I'll update once we do."
2,a little disappointed,"I bought this as a Christmas gift, so I didn't open to check the accordion prior to giving it away. It turned out after it was received that one of the buttons on the accordion didn't work. There was no sound generated from it. Probably won't replace it in case it happens again. It seems like a very delicate toy."
3,Xmas gift,Bought for 7 year Xmas. Pricey toy for what it is . Not really useful for real like play- more pretend play
4,Fantastic value,"Great, full sound for the price. No flats or sharps, but very playable in C major and G major. Recommended for the indie musician or home recording projects."
3,ok if you know frontpage,"this book, ok, if you already know say fp98, it is a ok reference, but not that good if you really want to learn"
5,poetry for personal growth,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING HUMANMITY AND THE HUMAN SOUL, WHY NOT GIVE THIS AWESOME BOOK A TRY. LEARN TO WRITE A POETRY/SPIRITUAL GROWTH JOURNA I ALSO LOVE HIS SECOND BOOK ""FATAL WOMEN"" EVEN BETTER."
1,I'm confused,"I think this excerpt says it all:""Consider Brandon and the Bipolar Bear: A Story for Children With Bipolar Disorder. It tells the story of a day in the life of Brandon, a young boy who is put to bed but then asks for a glass of water. He feels somewhat frightened and becomes tearful when left alone to fall asleep. Upon awakening, Brandon has a temper tantrum because he doesn't want to get out of bed. During the tantrum he tears off the arm of his beloved teddy bear. He is crushed by his destruction of his teddy bear but is greatly relieved when his mother offers to fix its arm. He becomes excited and bounces up and down on his bed. He goes to see Dr. Samuel, who tells him he has bipolar disorder. None of Brandon's behaviors, taken alone or even together, qualify as symptoms of bipolar disorder. Dr. Samuel medicates him anyway.""And that was the opinion of a psychiatrist:[...]"
2,upsetting to my son,"This book greatly upset my son. We bought it to help him understand bipolar disorder, and after reading it, he was very upset and depressed. Whether it was learning about how the disorder could affect him, or the way it was written, I am not sure. If you consider buying this book for your child, read it before you give it to him or her, and then read it together."
5,Sensitive and practical - this book is a must have!,"This book helps explain bipolar disorder and the treatment for it to both the child with the illness and the parents (and siblings). The illustrations help the book come alive and allow the child to see him or herself in the story and relate to Brandon. And while this book explains a serious illness, it offers hope. This is the best tool to introduce and explain this illness to a child."
1,Unsatisfied,"I am both a mental health care professional, and a mother of a child with Bipolar II. Although Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Cyclothalmia, differ greatly; there are many similarities. Unfortunately, none of them were connected in this book. When my child read it, the comment was, ""I could never relate to this book. It's not me!"". Nothing of the racing thoughts; the obsessiveness; the disruptive sleep patterns, etc. I shared the book with many of the families I work with, almost all had similar responses.I am happy to see the topic come up and be published for children. I just wish it could have been something that more of them and their parents could actually relate to."
4,glad this book exists!,"I actually got this book from the National Alliance for Mental Illness (something like that?) before it was published in color. At that point, it was just stapled together-- but it was (and still is) one of the only books like this accessible for kids. Its literary content isn't phenomenal-- it'll probably never win awards for story-- but it's important just because of the topic it covers..."
2,blah,"Did a side-by-side comparison at home with my old Yamaha DSP-A1 (which is Dolby Pro-Logic only) and I honestly didn't hear any improvement over the Yamaha after about a week of watching THX certified DVDs on a Sony Elite player with very good Paradigm speakers (7 speaker configuration for Onkyo, 5 for Yamaha). Actually I preferred the Yamaha which had a warmer and richer sound. The Onkyo is going back to Circuit City this week."
5,A really helpful and readable book,"As a parent I found this to be a really helpful book in understanding what was wrong with my son. It was also comforting to know about the different drugs, how they work, and if they were safe. It is the best book about childrens problems I have read."
2,all over the map,"wow,this thing is really all over the place.sometimes the acting is not bad.at other times,it' not good at all.the dialogue ranges from decent to lame.sometimes there's just no context.the tone is a mess.i can't tell if it was supposed to be a thriller, or a black comedy,or a parody.sometimes this thing is just so over the top,it's ridiculous.then,all of a sudden it switches gears,and it seems like it's trying to be serious.there's really more than one movie here.i guess it was an entertaining mess,if nothing else.i give it a 2--no wait--a 5--i mean a 4--or maybe a 3.wait a minute.i'm all over the place.kinda like this movie.i can't give it a rating.i wouldn't know where to start.but since i have to,i guess a 2* rating is as good as any. 2/5"
1,HORRIBLE FILM. THE TRUE EURO-TURKEY.,"Nothing of any interest here. Rent something else!This is a Spanish film shot in English with Spanish actors - so expect a huge latitude of accents (from laughable to hilarious). The story starts from a promising (an old village submerged by a big dam) and sinks fast into cliché (there was a devilish population of orgiastic devil worshipers there who suddenly come back 40 years after the fact to get some revenge).The film could have been a nice thing if it was not for an ultimately bad script that boosts laughable characters, laughable situations, a contrived story and many many many genre clichés. The effects are not bad, but one would expect better ideas.Mr. Yuzna, who is a talented director, keeps working with bad scripts and ruining his reputation. He should make less films and better ones. This is a Spanish quickie project made to exploit the relationship between the Spanish producer and the American distributor. Beware!"
1,Wierd,"The story is simple. Evil worshiper supposed to be drowned with his town is freed and lives until he can get revenge on the people that tried to kill him. He and his followers invade a small town near the location of his old town and possess the towns people except for two young teenmagers bent on saving thier town. What i dont get is in one second the town is perfectly sane and in the next they are eating each other and having sex in the streets. How this change occured is never really explained. Just Sane one minutes, totaly under satans control the next. Somehow the cult leader is able to possess people. Its a film that had potential but its many many flaws make it a failure. You are left with to many unexplained questions after the credits.PS> Its a complete Rip-off of the cthulhu universe created by HP Lovecraft"
2,terrible,great video quality and im a brian yuzna fan but this movie drags and has terrible acting off kilter tonal choices !
1,Learn from my mistake,"I picked up this CD while I was at Hollywood Video last night. It was in the bargain bin where you buy 2 CDs and get 2 for free. Sometimes I get lucky and find a real gem of a horror movie while searching the bargain bin. Not this time folks. This movie sucks. Its got demons, religious cults, zombies and a bunch of other distractions but the story is convoluted, the acting blows and the whole CD isn't worth my time, your time or anyone else's time. It shouldn't even be in the bargain bin waiting to snare unsuspecting horror fans like myself. It should be burned and then buried deep beneath still waters."
2,i don't remember anything about this movie,"so, i watch this movie and i really don't remember about it, that is how forgetible this movie really is. but it had a nice twist at the end... sorta."
1,Beneath Still Waters,Time is our most precious commodity: it is irreplaceable and limited. Don't waste any of yours on this movie. One star is too many. I lost 21 minutes of my time: 20 watching and 1 writing this review. Goodbye.
4,Commode,"Although lighter weight than I thought it would be, this commode is perfect for my mom. Assembly was a snap and it fits perfectly over the existing commode."
5,Great Poster,This Space Jam poster is a classic. I saw it when looking for posters for my dorm room and knew I had to have it. I've gotten numerous compliments on it since it was purchased. The poster is very crisp and in great quality.
2,Borrow From The Library,"I love the Lucy Stone series and will read the next book but this is a big disappointment. I wonder if it was even edited! The death doesn't even occur until halfway through the book and the plot is ridiculously weak. A kid could write better. Also, the book is mainly about things that never get resolved. One major mistake: As others have pointed out, the murderer is a character killed in an earlier book. Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Is 3 stars being too easy?,I am giving this book 3 stars but I am not sure it deserves them. This was a pretty lame attempt at telling a cozy story. I have bought other books in the series but this one was the first one I have read. I hope the others are a lot better.The writing was boring and trite. The murder didn't come til after a 150 pages in or so. And Lucy was not a very proactive protagonist. She stumbled onto the killer. No one would guess who the killer was because they were barely mentioned in the rest of the book.I would save my money and buy another mystery. Get this one at the library.
1,Callous Treatment of Animals,"One star was the rating I gave this book for that was the lowest choice available.I have read every book in the Lucy Stone series up to this one. ""Star Spangled Murder,"" I read halfway and threw it in the garbage. I have Ms. Meier's next book ordered; if I can't return it I will throw it away unread.I was first disturbed by this kind family keeping the family dog in almost a cage outside. This paled to the ""heroine's"" callous reaction to the death of the family pet, worrying that the driver of the car who hit her dog would sue her and going to make amends. I truly was disgusted when I read this.No more Leslie Meier books for me."
3,Not My Favorite,"This installment in the Lucy Stone series diverged in a plethora of directions. I don't really know what the author was trying to say. Rampant growth, nudists, tree huggers, poachers, chicken lovers, media frenzies, loss of a pet, and growing pains for a wide variety of ages of children are a few of the topics the author touched upon. The ending was as confusing and I am still confused.I do like this series and I am trying to read all of them. They are intertaining. It is an insight into a family that is different than my own. If you are trying to find a way to pass the time with a book, you won't be disappointed with the series.I give this one 2 1/2 stars."
5,Star Spangled Mystery,"This is one of my favorites in the Lucy Stone Series. She has really added more to the story line and included more elements to the story. I found this one to be a ""hard to put down"" mystery."
1,What has happened to the series?,"I was disappointed with this book. I returned it after reading only four chapters. What has happened to Meier's writing style? ""Spangled"" was a huge loss compared to a successful series. In this story, the characters are flat and one-dimensional. I was bored, to be honest, with everything that happened in the four chapters I read. Usually, Meier writes the murder at the beginning; however, in this case, it never happened, from what I've heard from friends, until the end. I was uninspired to find out."
3,LifeStride Shoes,"They are beautifully made and come in rich colors. However, after wearing them for a couple of hours, I thought they were not as comfortable as when first put on. Although I will wear the LifeStride shoes on occasion, I have since found a more comfortable shoe for all-day wear: Life Style by Hush Puppies and I would purchase more of that brand/style in the future."
2,DO NOT RECOMMEND,Skylink 318TN is slow to respond and has a very low range...DO NOT RECOMMEND.Go for the grey buttons and leave the blue buttons alone.
1,Don't buy with the Skylink 18 remote opener,"I was looking at the Skylink 18 remote opener. I decided that it was the unit I wanted. Down below, the Amazon ""Frequently Purchased Together"" showed the 18 remote opener with the 318TR transmitters. I clicked ""Add Both To Cart"" because NO WHERE did it say that the two were NOT compatible. Well, the 18 remote opener DOES work well, however, I have returned the 318 transmitters as they can NOT be made to work with the 18 remote opener. If you are purchasing the 318 opener, these are what you want. Do NOT buy them with the 18 opener. I will give the 18 opener high marks, but can not rate the 318 transmitter as it would not work with the 18 opener."
3,"Easy to install receiver, and like the key ring transmitters","Installed the receivers on the two 9 foot garage doors. Nice to have the remotes control the doors so we don't need to carry around the two dedicated remotes (which were lost necessating installing the Skylink units). The remotes are a bit bulky on the key ring, but smaller than most remotes."
3,Not compatible with 18TR,"This transmitter is only compatible with the 318TR, not the 18TR that it's advertised alongside. The 318TR is cheaper than the incompatible 18TR at time of writing anyways, so save yourself some hassle and a couple bucks. Also note that you should be able to buy a second 318TR instead of this (it's only a couple bucks difference) and change the codes to match, so you can control two things (say, the light in the garage? You'd need some electronic gadget in the middle to interface them...) with two 318TRs."
3,Somewhat dated.,"Written nearly a century ago, it's not the best book for the study of Armenian as it's spoken today. Bardakjian's book is much better."
3,not Porter's best book,"I recently discovered the late Roy Porter through his last book Flesh in the Age of Reason: The Modern Foundations of Body and Soul. After devouring that book I ordered both The Enlightenment and The Creation of the Modern World: The Untold Story of the British Enlightenment. The latter book lives up to my expectations but I was disappointed in the shorter book, which was no doubt constrained by the publisher's expectations since it is part of a series.My chief complaint is that because the book is so short, it seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with the main characters of period. For me this was only partially true. Therefore, I would not recommend this as a introduction to the subject."
2,Way too brief for such a broad topic,"Make sure you realize how few pages there are. This is an exceedingly brief treatment of a topic, the Enlightenment, on which others have written volumes of full-length books-only 68 pages of text, quite pricey per page."
1,Dangerously sharp bottom,"The pot I bought had a dangerously sharp bottom. Would have been very easy to get a nasty cut or damage counter tops. I called the company I bought it from and they said all the ones they had also had very sharp bottoms and they would pay for the return of the pot.If this is a flaw, and most of them don't have bottoms like these, it would make a great pot."
4,Good old Brunetti,"Again Brunetti charms us, and this time he is charmed by the wonderful Elena. A solid mystery, an interesting twist in a relationship, a part of Venice we don't really know....what could be better."
4,A venture outside Brunetti's usual world that works,"I was at first concerned that taking Brunetti outside his usual office/apartment world might not work but I was wrong. Also, including Signorina Elettra in the story to the extent the author has done did worry me, but I needn't have been concerned. It all flows well, though a little shakily at times. It's a different style of story from the usual Commissario collection, but enjoyable nonetheless."
3,A Sea of troubles,The Brunetti serries are generally good to very good. This one fall a little below that. Still- that is better than most.
4,Mystery,"Well written modern mystery series. This is the first book by Leon that I read, and since have read many more. Non-gory, and a little slow, but that is one of the reasons I like her books. Thoughtful and beautifully written. Sometimes a little preachy about issues such as racism, the environment, but overall a great read."
4,She never disappoints,Dona Leon is one of my very favorite authors. I love her characters and am always sad when a book ends
1,Brunetti in Senility,"If you've never read a Brunetti book, this may not relate to this, but what in the world has happened to this character. All I can say is that he has turned into a brainless, self-indulgent person. He is surprised that the phone # used to report tax evaders to the Finance Ministry is real? He doesn't know the difference between ""rough sex"" and rape? Those are only two examples of how ignorant the writer makes this character. Is it so we forgive a death that is the result of his self indulgent? Is it so we forgive his refusal -stated and otherwise - to check his premises and his motives? Basically the story is OK, but I would definitely skip this one."
3,Mediocre...,So I should start by saying that this item does exactly what is says it does; it charges the phone.......most of the time. The problem is that one of the spring clips that are responsible for keeping the plug in the lighter socket is not formed correctly. It manages to push itself out of the socket.
3,comment,"This disc is volume II to the 1996 release of Tailleferre's music by Helicon. Although perhaps not as attractive as the first volume, there is no reason to dismiss the disc as a failure. Slower tempi or not, overall, these are good performances, and if you are collecting Tailleferre's recordings as I am, you will want to have this recording."
4,"relaxing, soothing","Had had this item years ago on tape, but tape wears out with time. Seems to have been the only thing that Haze Greenfield had put out in the late '80s, has nice relaxing, calming tracks. So I enjoy listening to it from time to time."
5,"Same as Treets, good blades","These are the same blades as the Treet brand. They both says 009RD on the blades and are made by the same company, American Safety Razor (ASR) Company. I bought these at Fred Meyer. I can get 3-4 good shaves with them. After that you can definitely feel the blade start tugging and then it's time to insert a new blade. Single-edge blades definitely work best when they are fresh. They degrade rather quickly compared to double-edge blades.I use these in the following GEM razors I own: Micromatic Open Comb, Micromatic Clog Pruf, Featherweight, G-bar/Heavy Flat Top (I have two versions!), 1912 Damaskeene and a Push Button. The Featherweight really isn't worth buying, it's only 30 grams and it's hard to get a good smooth shave with one (at least if you have a heavy beard)."
1,Little Green Dots,"I bought this as an extension to a Apple 23"" Cinema Display. The female end does not accept the standard tightening screws, which may explain why the screen image had hundreds of pixels replaced by bright green dots, especially in darker areas of the screen. Either the connection cannot be made tight enough (lack of screws) or the cable is simply inferior. To check, I purchased a replacement (same female to male 6' dvi cable) by ""Cable to Go"" and it works perfectly. The replacement cable has tightening screws at the female end, so I don't know exactly why this StarTech cable failed, but it failed. In a quasi-controlled experiment, the StarTech cable gets one star (you do get most of the video signal)."
3,First Lady of the New Frontier: Jackie Kennedy,Book is ok in giving some inside information regarding her days in the White House but still tells a lot of the same stuff many other books on her say. A book on Jackie Kennedy that would tell things you never expected to hear would be a very rare book indeed. As the expression goes: same church - different pew.
5,As short as excellent!,"The short case histories reported by the author (who gathered a vast experience working for a wild birds rescue center) are so well written that they result moving and inspiring in themselves, beside a tool for understanding how holistic principles apply to dramatic emergencies. These examples say a lot about homeopathy, much more than any theory ever will. Many birds that would have been considered in desperate conditions for the usual vet practise, recovered completely. Make you think, and leave you wanting to learn more. No matter if you are an avid wild bird-watcher or a lover of cage softbills and parrots, it's likely that you'll read it two or three times, and reflect a lot about it. And will be more ready to face some possible bad incidents or diseases of your feathered friends, or of sick wild birds you happen to find."
3,Coils Masonic Encyclopedia,"I am a Freemason and use this for research in educational talks, it is excellent reference material"
1,Another Grandmother Responds,"My heart fell to the ground to read the other grandmother's review recommending this book.I can look my sons in the eyes knowing that I served and protected as well as nurtured my children, as they do theirs. I did not allow the sado-medico rituals of our dominator society to harm them in any way. Keeping my sons whole is my contribution to a more peaceful world.I invite readers to look into their own hearts on this issue of circumcision. After all, our hearts are the most intelligent organ of our bodies. Better yet, first observe a circumcision in person or at least on video if you face this choice or know someone who does. Then listen to your heart."
1,This book contains misleading information,After researching circumcision resources on the Internet I read this book to see how its information compared to other sources. It did not fare well in light of current research which is readily available online.The book's views seem antiquated when compared to the vast majority of recently published reports on the subject. It appears that the author is attempting to promote his religious views disguised as medical rationale. I suggest seeking other sources for comparison before making a decision about having a child's body surgically altered by circumcision.
1,"Weird pro-circumcision screed, and poorly written to boot!","Weiss has been writing in minor journals for years, extolling the virtues of circumcision for all manner of health benefits. The book is essentially a tract, not a balanced account of anything."
1,What a price to pay for rant and agenda,"I have read Weiss's little pro-circumcision book and found it laugable. Is he going senile, is he carrying a secret cultural agend, does he actually think anyone of right mind would pay 50 dollars for this work of ego and bias.I'm sure he and his dear, albeit diminishing pro-circ supporters find it difficult to think this ritual mutilation in non Moslem/Jewish society is decreasing. Anyone who has actually seen a circumcision and has had their eyes open, can not think of this as anything other the child abuse most dire.If the "" good "" doctor has done many of these sexual mutilations premptively one could only hope he can sell enough of this none sense to pay his lawyer, when his victims decide to sue him."
1,More BS from Pro-Circ dogma,"It is unbelievable people are still clinging to the mistaken belief that the mutilation of circumcision can somehow be benificial. Sure, it's benificial, to all the doctors and mohels getting rich off cutting up screaming babies."
5,A Very Helpful Book**,"My 4 year old son came home from school excitedly sharing all the details of this book having heard it in story time that day.His very best friend had gone away for a month this summer for vacation and it was especially hard for him. The month felt like forever to him. Although we discussed it during that time, This book addressed this issue for him in a special way and his emotions about missing his friend really came to the surface and he learned how to deal with them...THANK YOU to the writers of this book!!"
2,Nothing Special,"Currently, I'm practicing for the MCATs. I've compared the tests in this book to the sample exams in Barron, Kaplan, and Princeton. It rates lower than the others, if edition 2001 or recent. The passages are highly quantitative and not qualitative. If you want to test your foundation, give this book a shot. The verbal passages are definetely too easy in this book for the real deal. The physical sciences introduce common experiments, graphs, etc seen thru college coursework. Sadly, this won't be on the exam. Nevertheless, it helped me clear up certain areas which I misunderstood. If you're really running out of sources than I recommend u refer to this book, otherwise look into the Kaplan 45. Those passages will twist your brain into knots."
3,"Sometimes fascinating, sometimes disappointing.","I LOVE the road rally world, so it was a no-brainer for me to buy this book used. It is ~200 pages, and the first 50 or so are just talking about how the two teammates met and who they were. When the author gets into the ""meat of the hamburger"", it it hit-or-miss with how the book is. There are portions that are extremely entertaining, where I see an event through another pair of eyes, and heard a few stories I had not known about before. But there are several times where the author diverges into tangents about completely unimportant subjects, and some of them last multiple pages. I was either very attentive to the book, or lost interest, depending on the content. I would recommend this book only for a quick read for a true gumball junkie, and would only recommend picking it up used."
5,Just great!,"Finally a memoir of abuse that it's not whiny: Marie Etienne loves to write and writes well, pulls no punches and every sentence in her book is utterly believable. Too bad that 'Storkbites' did not make the mass distribution: it deserves better~"
4,A tough but worthwhile read,"I have to admit that after reading the first five pages of this book that I had to put it down and contemplate whether or not I was going to keep reading. This is a tough story of a wealthy Louisiana family and the secrets they harbor inside their home. Reading about the abuse and the subsequent emotional problems all the children experience was at times painful and uncomfortable but I absolutely could not put it down.Marie Etienne has written an honest and unflinching account of her childhood and I imagine she made and lost some friends and/or family members in the process. But as she writes in the epilogue, it was a catharsis for her and I believe it is cathartic for the reader as well. It is hard to discuss this book without citing specific incidents and in essence ""giving it away"" but as an avid memoir fan, I would recommend it wholeheartedly."
4,A Long Frightful Journey,I would not trade lives with Marie but I really loved how she was able to recognize the bad behavior and instead of repeating her mothers way of dealing with pain. She was able to recognize it in herself to the point of getting help. I like books that deal with change and recovery.
1,MacBook Battery,This battery is built cheaply. The cover plate is coming apart and I can see the internal batteries through the opening. I figure I have to use some superglue to hold it together.Update: 12/14/08It also does not last very long. 3 months later and it is It is already DOA. Had to buy a genuine Apple battery to replace it already.
2,I had to get it,"I really only got it because I had no other choice. When it's working right, its fine; with good life and a handy indicator on the back to check power level. However, my first one went south after only 15 months, and now won't hold a charge for any significant amount of time. I now have three of these (including the original, which is good for like 30 minutes) to make sure I get the time I need on the computer. The power source went south not long after."
1,Swelling cells make this battery unusable.,We bought this battery as a replacement. Shortly afterwards the center cell started to swell up. The metal panel that becomes the bottom of the laptop for the battery area came unglued. This one is toast!
1,Battery doesn't last longer than 1 hour..,When I initially ordered this product the company sent me a fake version of it. When I called them about the mix up they immediately sent out a new battery for me and apologized for the inconvenience. This is the second TruePower battery I have purchased for my Macbook Pro. I don't think I will be buying one again. This second one just doesn't sit correctly or flush in the bottom of my laptop. I purchased this battery in April and 7 months later I am lucky if it lasts and hour before going dead. With the battery being on 7 months hold it should hold a charge longer than 60 minutes. I only use the computer to search the web and check email. I do not listen to music or stream videos or play video games. I find this to be totally unacceptable.
1,BrilliantStore does NOT sell this product,"I thought I ordered the FastMac TruPower battery, however the item that arrived was a DekCell batteryDekcell Laptop Battery for Apple A1175, Apple MacBook Pro 15"" Series. The DekCell battery is a cheaper battery that is now defective. I contacted BrilliantStore and they had never heard of FastMac. Read the negative customer reviews. This happened with other products they sell as well. This is fraud."
1,not OEM,"Price was good, fit and finish was suburb, unfortunately its whats inside that counts and in this case I wish I spent the money for the real deal. Worked ok for a few weeks, then just started dying out of the blue. Finally, even when the computer was plugged in half the time I couldnt power up and or it would die. I actually took it in to get looked at because I was afraid I had some virus or something that my software missed. As soon as I started explaining things to tech he pulls out the battery, plugs the laptop in without the battery, and bingo. Started to short or something inside the battery itself apparently."
2,False economy - poor battery health,"When I first got this battery, it would go over two hours on a full charge, which was better than the two-year-old Apple battery. Four months later, it's down to an hour and a half. Further, the battery health according to iStat is 83%; it took the original battery 2 years for the battery health to get that low. I don't think that the savings from getting this battery instead of a replacement from Apple were worth the drop in quality.The battery fits in place fairly well, although it's not quite flush with the case ( ~ 1 mm difference)"
1,you cant transfer an intuit product,"Seller was helpful, but in the end I had to return for a full refund. Intuit does not allow registered software to be transfered to a new owner. :("
1,"Save your money, buy a Timberlake chemistry book instead","This textbook consistently buries important information in very wordy text. If you've taken an introductory chemistry course before and were hoping to scan the chapters to refresh your memory while doing homework or studying -- this is NOT the book for you.Homework questions are at the end of each chapter, and frequently are more conceptual than stoichiometry type questions. Although I am not a fan of math, the stoichiometry questions are crucial to master now if you will be taking any pharmacology courses in the future (think R.N. programs).If you have the option, buy Karen Timberlake's General, Organic and Biological Chemistry textbook instead. Apparently, that is what my school's chemistry department will be switching to next year; I recently purchased it and I wish I had bought it much sooner."
5,Happy with book purchase!!!!!,"The book arrived even before it was promised. It also was in the condition they discribed it. I am happy with the book.Thank you Amazon, for providing us students affordable school books. I know I'll be coming back in the future.192231"
1,Misleading image and description,"Beware, this item is only the squeegee. The telescoping handle shown is not included and must be purchased separately. The description should clearly state this."
5,Great Performance,"This CD epitomizes what I have always loved about the Yellow Jackets. The melodies are unforgetable and the rhythmic elements hypotizing. Bob Mintzer's playing is phenomenal. The quality of the recording is very, very good and this is a fine live recording. I deliberately put it on after ""Jazz at the Pawnshop"" and it sounded very respectable. Should be a must have for any jazz lover. I have only watched the DVD once but it is very enjoyable too."
5,one of my favorites,"The Golden Age is a perfect title for this poerty book, each poem, ageless, projecting a time in the history of a beautiful country."
4,Tarzan,"I love these movies, especially ""Tarzan and his mate"". Maureen O'Sullivan is very sexy. I still haven't watched them all."
4,Brings back good memories,"If you watched Tarzan on TV way back when - like in the sixties - you will love this collection. Of course, these are the best of all the various Tarzan movies that were made. So what if every movie has the same basic plot...that's what we expect. You love seeing the familiar stories again. The video is pretty good, the oldest movies are not as clean as the last couple but still above average. The extras are mediocre. Now I bought this from Amazon when it was on sale for $20 - fantastic price. $45 is way too much, though."
3,Movies Good but NO Captions or Subtitles on Bonus Features!!,"I am in the middle of watching the Tarzan films. So far I have seen Tarzan of the Apes (1932), which was pretty good; Tarzan Finds a Son (which I have waited over 30 years to see with captions), and Tarzan and His Mate. The ""nude"" scene is actually not that big a deal by today's standards...and Tarzan himself does not get down to his birthday suit."
4,The Lord of the Jungle at his best,This is the best collection of Tarzan movies; Johnny Weissmuller is the definitive Tarzan like Pierce Brosnan is James Bond. I remember the weekend afternoons that I saw these flicks and thought I gotta learn how to yell like that. Plus I loved the reruns of Carol Burnette too.
2,"Check DVD's for dirt, smugges","The discs I received in this package are full of fingerprint smugges and some kind of grimy dust. One disc has a scratch near the center hole. Please CHECK the conditions of your discs. I had a similar problem with another MGM title ""Green Acres Season 1"" and had to go through 3 sets before I found one that was somewhat acceptable. Some players, like mine, are very sensitive to these anomolies. Someone at MGM Home Entertainment is not watching their quality control very carefully."
5,UMGAWA Cheetah,"Johnny is the only real Tarzan (even though he couldn't really act his way out of a bag) and to find all (almost) his films in one collection (two actually, I guess) was a really cool find. My wife and I get up early on Sat. mornings and watch WB cartoons on Blu-ray followed by a few 3 Stooges shorts and a Tarzan film while sittin' in bed eatin' cereal. It's just like being 10 years old again with no cares or worries in the world."
5,Tarzan Collection Starring Jonny Weissmuller,"The movies were great,My family enjoyed them very much.I recommend them to anyone that loves old movies."
5,Perfect gift for Mom's over 70,"I bought this for my mom (77) and she loves it. It brings back wonderful memories of seeing these movies for the first time when she was young. Any mom or dad of a ""certain age"" would love this.CR"
4,Tarzan the Ape Man,"I brought this for my mom, she love Johnny Weissmuller. My mom feels that no one did it better then him being Tarzan. Well she received the movies I became her favorite Child!"
3,"Great movies, poor transfer - shame on you WB!","For my generation, Tarzan will always be one of the most memorable characters. I was so happy to get this set and watch it with my son now. It seems, however, that WB again did not want to invest any money in restoring these movies. Don't get me wrong, I know these movies are from the thirties - I also know, as an avid film collector, what the 21st century technology can do to improve the transfer of movies like these; WB chose to ignore this technology and, if memory serves, they did this before to other films. The video and especially the audio are below VHS at times. TOO BAD! My son still likes them, because they are very entertaining but, at times, without the captions, you cannot understand what the actors are saying. 2004 WB!"
5,The Complete Tarzan Movies from MGM,Excellent nostalgia - Great price - Very good resolution - Am very satisfied -
4,Amazing Movies,"Johnny Weissmuller is by far the BEST Tarzan you'll ever find. If you like older black and white movies, you'll love these DVDs. The original storyline is different from the books, so if you expect close to book quality work, not so much for you.Four stars instead of five because the movies aren't put on the DVDs in the correct order."
4,A must for the Tarzan/Johnny Weismuller fan,"I bought this for my Dad, a young ""seventy-something"" for his birthday. He loved the quality of the video and enjoyed seeing his favorite episodes of one of his favorite shows - I remember watching them with him as a kid. Great for anyone who loved this series the first time around as well as to introduce it to the younger generations who may have missed it the first time around, my kids are going to love watching these with him."
3,The one and only real Tarzan--Johnny Weissmuller!,"Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer, was billed as ""the only man in Hollywood who is natural in the flesh and can act without clothes."" Maureen O'Sullivan was chosen for his mate, and the film concentrated on romance and ignored Tarzan's origins...It was in this movie, that Tarzan becomes the unintelligible, but very sexy man-ape that most cinema-goers recognize... The famous phrase ""Me Tarzan, You Jane' was never spoken, but the film did include Tarzan constantly pointing to himself and then to Jane, enunciating ""Tarzan - Jane.""It was in this film that Cheetah the chimpanzee made the debut... The film was an enormous success, and Weissmuller's simple native hero became the forerunner of many subsequent versions..."
4,Good Step-up Ring,Works as it should. It does seem to get too snug with the lens or filter and can be difficult to remove sometimes.
1,art of sewing paper back,i ordered these from 5 different sellers and all had to return my money cause item not available. AMAZON U NEED TO UPDATE WHATS AVAILABLE I was very dissapointed.
3,Arthur's Halloween,"Arthur's Halloween is about Arthur who is afraid of pretty much everything. When Halloween comes, he is told he has to take his sister. When trick or treating the two get lost behind and D.W. goes in the so-called Witch House, and Arthur has to go get her. The book teaches that you shouldn't judge somebody by what other people tell you. This book is good for kids 4-8. I thought it was an ok book."
3,"They worked, but wrong size.","The molds came out fine. The dolphins are larger than I anticipated. I was expecting about an inch to 2 inch dolphin molds, but they are 4 to 5 inches long and come out very thick. Way too big for cupcakes, but may work for a large cake."
3,Review for the use to DMC FZ150,"I estimated for the use of TCON-300 to DMC FZ150.But the compatibility between DMC-FZ150 and TCON-300 was bad.The reason is an aberration.Though the efficiency of TCON-300 is good,the compatibility between digitalcamera and TCON-300S is very important."
4,Another good start from Junji Ito,"The previous reviewer nailed the content of this book fairly well. Not on the same level as Junji's earlier masterpiece Uzumaki, but this is a different kind of book in any case. Gyo volume 1 is to some degree an homage to old-school Japanese monster/disaster cinema, but the story looks likely to veer off in other directions in later volumes. Recommended."
4,Entertaining...,"Kat Martin has rapidly become one of my favorites. I enjoy historical romances, but I eventually become tired of all the dukes and earls and whatnot. So it always pleases me when I can find a decent contemporary romance. Add a little suspense and maybe some mystery and man I am one happy camper. This did all those things for me. Grab this one if you can, and read it. You'll definitely enjoy it. I know I did."
2,Ughhh it was never ending,The unhappy buisness women gets up and moves herself and her son to a remote town in the mountains to find out who really killed her grandmother whom she never knew. She meets a wonderful hunk of a man whom she falls in love with. Please everythig seemed so planned. there was no spontinaity in this book. If you want a good Kat Martin book read THE DREAM.
2,TWO STARS AND TWO COMPLAINTS,"I can't remember if I've read other books by Kat Martin, but I certainly hope they are better than this one. Two complaints: (1) This plot is sooooooo old. It has been done in books AND movies. (2) The main squeeze is engaged. Engaged! Does he tell Kate? Heck no! It was hard for me to like this guy. Not a keeper."
5,AGREEMENT,"I AGREE THAT AMAZON SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT THIS BOOK WAS RECYCLED. AND WHATS WRONG WITH AUTHORS NOW, THAT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE A SERIES. SOME OF THEM GO ON AND ON ABOUT A FAMILY OR A TOWN. AD NAUSEUM SAME PLOT IN EVERYONEF. I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT WHEN I SEE A SUPPOSEDLY NEW BOOK BY THAT AUTHOR I LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF"
3,"Okay, but to predictable","The begining of this book was great, how the herione was searching to find out who she really is. But after the first 100 pages or so things started going down hill. I ususally LOVE Kat Martins books but this one instead of capturing my interest it lost it. The cahrecters became very weak especially the heroins son. He was such a rebellious boy and then overnight he became this good little boy who excepted what any one else said. If you want a good Kat Martin book I would suggest THE DREAM, I couldent put it down."
2,Can't use it.,I'm sure this stuff would help but I could not for the life of me swallow these nasty gross nasty pills... So gross I couldn't look at them after awhile and threw them out.
3,Still Havent Tried It,This Product is probably better if used when u have actually been excersising. I Have Used This Product Before And Its Best If You Eat One Meal In the Morning Before You Begin The Taking A Pill!! And If You Are Trying To Conceive Becareful Because your baby can be harmed!!
4,An excellent survey from the top scholars in the field,"Zuidervaart and Huhn's anthology of essays covers considerable ground pertaining to the importance of the aesthetic in Adorno's philosophical writings. Readers interested in Adorno's complex relationship to Kantian aesthetics will find much of interest here, as will those interested in more recent ('post-structuralist') developments."
4,America minus Peek At Their Best,"No, Danny Peek is not with them, but this, in my opinion, is the best concert video of America presently available. It is in 5.1 Digital, but doesn't really add much to the quality of sound. I have seen America at least 7 times in Concert and i would rank this as #3 as the best of their concerts, from the standpoint of energy and showmanship. They have had better playlists, would have like to have heard ""Riverside"", ""California Revisited"", and ""To Each His Own"", but all in all a good set. ""Sandman"" is just awesome, never wanted the song to end. For the money, an excellent buy. as always, Amazon delivers timely and as offered."
4,A fun video to watch for nostalgic reasons!!,I enjoyed the video for the music (audio is out of whack) and the scenes of 1970's New York!! Brought back alot of memories!! Unless you are a fan of America i wouldn't recommend this video for its audio quality. But all in all... a fun video if you want to relive your youth!!
1,Terrible audio on this DVD,"I have purchased many DVDs and VHS music videos. I just love to watch and listen to the music performers, but this audio is the poorest excuse for a music video that I have ever seen. Save your money until they come out with something better."
5,Great concert DVD,"The audio sounds fine to me, but I don't have an expensive sound system hooked-up to my TV so that may make a difference. A high energy performance while they were still in their prime. Since the tour was promoting their just released ""Silent Letter"" album, it contains the only live recordings of several songs from that album including ""Only Game In Town,"" ""Foolin"", and ""All Night"". Plus it contains many of their classics like ""Horse With No Name"", ""Ventura Highway"", and ""Sister Golden Hair."" It is like traveling back in time to 1979."
3,Bad Audio,"Nice Video presentation, but the Audio sounds like the recording equipment was located inside a large Closet, Muffled and not very good at all.But a reasonable price, and if you like the band America, you will probably still enjoy the DVD."
2,I expected more,"I love this band and was very excited to get this DVD. When I watched it, however, I was disappointed. The sound quality is terrible, but that is probably due to the film's age. It was enjoyable, though, to see Gerry and Dewey at the height of their fame and the prime of their career. There are other America DVDs out there that provide a much better listening and viewing experience. Save your money and buy one of those."
1,Inappropriate for children!,"I honestly don't understand how a book like this can be considered ""suitable"" for children. The pictures are rather pornographic! The woman shoots bullets from her breasts and there's a 2-page spread of her sitting ... well ... spread-eagle. I thought it was a tad too sexual for children."
3,A Nice CD,I'm a big fan of Will Downing. But I didn't like Emotions as much as I liked Sensual Journey. My favorite song is a Million Ways to Please a Woman. While it is a nice CD it left me wanting.Sensual Journey is the better bargain.
3,Didn't do it for me,"Now don't get me wrong. I loooovvvee Will Downing. I really do. But this is nothing compared to Sensual Journey. Yes, he does a great job on the cover songs. Yes, A Million Ways is very sensuous. Yes, his voice is superb as always. But, Sensual Journey is his magnum opus. If you're trying to decide which one to purchase, I suggest Sensual Journey over Emotions any day."
4,Vintage Downing,"Great CD! Will has some gems, including A Million Ways to Please a Woman. What I expect from Will's CDs is to be able to put it in the CD player, and relax to soulful ballards with smooth jazz cuts. This CD meets my expectation. He has all of the top smooth jazz artists, Norman Brown, George Duke, Paul Jackson, Jr., and even Nicolas Payton on the horn. Great stuff."
2,It's function and style vs. sound quality,"If you need a lanyard to easily carry around your iPod nano, then this will work. It comes in black so it will match the more popular nano color (unlike the Apple lanyard, which only comes in white). It looks very nice. Even though the length is not adjustable, it was about right for me.It's a bit difficult to connect it, but there is no chance of it coming out if you run or play sports. It comes with extra buds so you can find the right size to fit your ears.The big problem is the sound quality. It is really muddled - 'not crisp'. It's kind of like listening to an old FM radio. The dynamic range is just not there. I tried every nano EQ setting to try to adjust for it. The best I found was 'treble increase' and even then, it still sounded awful to me.In short, this works well for a lanyard, and will fit your ears right. But, if what you hear matters most, you won't find this product worth the sacrifice."
4,Almost great,"I use my 2 year-old Nano a lot! I listen to audiobooks on my daily 2 1/2 hour cummute, so the thing is practically permanently attached to my neck. Within a year of purchasing my nano & white Apple lanyard, I had a very dirty-looking lanyard, even though I tried washing it & scrubbing it with a toothbrush, etc. Though clean, the thing remained greyish. I found the Griffin black lanyard and thought I had a permanent solution to the problem. Alas! Although the Griffin lanyard has fine sound, & a better, more practical look, its construction is not nearly as durable. At the back of the neckpiece is a rubber connection where the string for the neck and the headphone wires meet-- the rubber insulation wore out at the juncture and rendered the copper wires frayed-- in sum, it was kaput after 6 mos. Why can't Apple make a black lanyard or Griffin make a more sturdy one? Ugh."
2,Doesn't work with 2nd Generation iPod nano,This lanyard doesn't fit the 2nd generation iPod Nano (8gb etc.) and the sound is poor to average when using the 1st generation iPod.
2,No directions,"Pre-pasted border seems like it's ready to stick on the wall...I looked for a link to contact the seller, but can't find one. Item does not come with directions so we are unsure how to apply the border. Seemed like an awesome product and we were very excited to get it. Unfortunatley not what we expected."
4,Durian really is the KING of FRUITS!!!,"My goodness. Mmm....wait a min...mmmmm...ok.Yeah! Everybody must try it. It's so unbelievable. I gave a 4 because it doesn't have universal appeal. It's ugly, and stinky. But the taste...WOW!!! If I had to describe it, it would be vanilla, banana, onions, and spices all mixed in such a perfect proportion, it's unbelievable!Buy it, try it, and love it."
5,"This CD Gives an Accurate ""Feeling"" of One of Her Concerts","I had the pleasure of attending Damaris Carbaugh's concert on February 18 at my church, and this CD recreates that experience.Ms. Carbaugh is a committed Christian, who gives a running commentary on Jesus Christ's influence in her life between her songs.Every song on this CD is special, but ""He Has Forgiven Me"" and ""I Am Not Ashamed of the Gospel"" are great and had the audience at the concert in tears. When asked to give a benediction after her last song, our rector had to stop time and again to regain his composure.If you love Gospel and Christian music and if you love a tremendous mezzo soprano singer, buy this CD. You will not be disappointed!"
4,"Good, but...","I'm a fan of this book and it really does break down the swing very nicely. There are some points, however, that quite align with ""modern"" practices. The grip, for instance, is a little weak compared to what Mr. Leadbetter professes in his more current instruction books. It's a good read, but if you're only going to get one Leadbetter book I'd go for Leadbetter's 100% Golf. It's a little more reader-friendly and covers not only the swing but the short game and putting as well."
2,a very dangerous book,"Yes, the ideas propagated in this book worked for Nick Faldo, but he was already a heck of a player before meeting the author, as well as a six foot four inch world class athlete. Adult improvers are warned that Ledbetter's method works best for tall long legged athletes for whom distance is not a problem. Faldo himself became a relatively short although devastatingly accurate hitter. There is far too much twisting of the body to make this method entirely safe for the average back. That said, the book is artfully done and has lovely pictures. Put this one on the coffee table and read the one John Jacobs wrote in 1977."
2,ONLY FOR THE LAYMAN!!!!,"I was disappointed. I mean Feynman is Feynman, and it is great listening to him, but this particular lecture was over simplified. If you are looking for any type of deep insight, you will be disappointed as well."
1,hardly sophisticated!!,"A very trite, thin story with a leading man who is so infantile and boring I could toss the book against a wall! Witty? I suppose if ""wit"" is him constantly laughing at dumb remarks. It is just too much to believe that all of Venice's [good looking] women would find him even worth bothering with much less irresistable. With the exception of the commissario and the princess (who are at least two dimensional)all the characters in this book are so shallow and repellent! The ""mystery"" degrades into a silly contrived mess. If you are looking for a truly sophisticated, intelligent and TRULY witty set of Venice mysteries read Donna Leon's commissario Brunetti series. From a previous review I had hoped for a similar quality of novel, but alas....NOT!!! Also, the punctuation and writing style seem amateur. Save your precious reading time for anything else."
4,Another very good Kapena album!,"Kapena does the best version of Maui Girl I've ever heard. I've memorized the words and often sing along to Talimaia, which is Samoan and a most excellent song. Kapena has a talent for playing the music of many different Pacific Islands, not just Hawai'i. These guys are great!"
1,Self-Serving Tripe,"This little book is nothing but self-serving tripe.A little book from a little man. Save your money. He will be a footnote in history, and you can read that for free."
2,Self-defeating Vermont gets what it deserves,"As others have said, this book is nothing more than self-serving drivel. But, even more than that, subsequent national events have shown Jeffords's move not only to be trivial, but self-deceiving and self-defeating as well......Allegedly, Jeffords split the GOP to get more funding for special education, but the year passed without any special ed funding passing in the congress, even with Dem control of the Senate. More hilariously, the Dems were unable to even pass dairy price supports, which the GOP always had, to benefit Vermont's dairy farms!So Vermont, enjoy your increased farm layoffs!"
1,A Declaration?,"Amazing story: after campaigning as a Republican, taking Republican campaign funds, and being elected as a Republican, Jim Jeffords ""declared"" he was no longer a Republican. Mind you, Jim had been a Republican for years before. His party's direction was clear--and he remained. Until six months after the election, that is.His book is generally just a re-hash of his ""speech"" where he betrayed all the Republicans who supported him. If you feel the need to read it, check it out at the library. Spending hard-earned money on the tome would be frivolous.The ""declaration"" looks even dimmer in the light of the 2002 congressional elections...Jeffords is now relegated to a mere footnote in the 21st century."
1,Testimony to a Traitor,"My expectation of a well documented explanation of this senator's betrayal of his party and constituents was quickly dashed in the 1st couple of pages. Having read his compendium of lame excuses and tripe, I believe he did the Republican party a service. There are more holes in his arguments for bolting his party than in a sieve. Perhaps he will conjure excuses to re-up with the party again when he realizes his errors in his judgment just like he reconsidered his marriage/divorce with his wife. His fickleness is apparent in politics just as it exists in his life and throughout this empty book."
1,Lacks credibility,"The book seems to lack some elements of truth. It seems to be missing details and lacks continuity in certain places. Details don't seem to match. For what was a very short period, the author's seems unbeleivable. Based on the Jeffords seen on tv, it does not appear to be his voice. There was probably lots of editing to sell this book to slam the Republicans. The reality painted seems to be through rose colored glasses with Jeffords having no responsibility for anything - the Republicans were the bad guys always. Also unbelievable is the Democrats being so acomodating. Consequently, it is quite difficult to believe that this one-sided view of the events reflects anykind of reality. It is impossible to believe this perception of the story has any serious grounding inthe truth. The account rather than being a realistic account of an important political story reflects a fairy tale."
1,Power monger,This man took the right of the people to decide the balance of the senate into his own hands. His self righteous reasoning was an interesting commentary on modern day politics but a disgrace.
5,A True Hero,"A masterful piece of work! Jeffords guides the reader through the months leading up to his historic decision that toppled the three legged stool of the GOP. A great read for history buffs, political scientists, or those who are searching for an everyday hero!"
5,The Truth,"We all know that the Bushes (Governor and current president), five members of the Supreme Court, and Kathleen Harris STOLE the presidential election from the American people.... but in one swoop Jeffords took a piece of it back for us... now he tells us how and why."
1,...96 pages were more than enough.,To say that Jim Jeffords is not a very articulate speaker would be understating the obvious - 96 pages were more than enough.
1,This Book is a total waste of money. This man is delusional.,Useless vanity from a useless person.Don't bother.
5,A candid and thorough telling of an important story,"Speaking may not be Sen. Jeffords' forte, but he has managed to lay out a compelling story of a decision which changed the American political landscape as much as any election could. Political figures come to life in his account. His generosity of spirit also shines through the text. He's very different from those who ultimately drove him away from a party which has become quite strident in its conservatism and lacking in its compassion in recent years.Kudos to the Senator (and to his aide Mark Powden, who doubtless had a big role in bringing this project to completion) for his courage and for sharing the inside scoop so completely. A must-read for those who care about the future of American politics."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this thinking it would be a good nanny cam. Turns out it is pretty useless. Sound quality is aweful. The picture is fuzzy and only works in really bright light. If it gets even remotely dark, all you see is a green screen. Save your money and buy something that works"
3,"Good info, but D-R-Y W-R-I-T-I-N-G!","Pretty good overall, it covers the principles involved in appraisal in-depth. However, the writing style was horrible. The authors could definitely use a writing class or two. I found myself at the end of most paragraphs having no idea what I had just read. It was incredibly painful to finish this book, but worth it in the end."
3,well written,"The book itself is quite good. It is well written and I enjoyed reading it.However, It is not appropriate for what I intended to read it. So far I do not have any comparison but I am defenitely not able to do an own appraisal now. Many (to me important) things are just mentioned but not discussed in detail.Additionally, (at least in the 9th. edition) there are a lot of mistakes in the exercises. Since the tasks are really easy, you will see this mistakes very fast but it is nontheless very annoying.Bottomline, it gives a great insight into the field of real estate appraisal and shows some basic techniques for very simple tasks. Unfortunately, that's it!"
2,Short on helpful advice,If you're looking to learn how to appraise a home than this isn't the best book to get. As a beginner it was hard to get a grasp of appraising.
4,working well,We put this up at our medical office. It seems to be sturdy and was easy to install . . . just needed some concrete.
5,"Architectural Mailboxes Oasis In-ground Post, Black","This is a heavy duty post that will not be moved, unless you own a tank, once it's been properly set."
1,Indefinitely backordered,This item has been on order for over a month and has not yet been delivered.
2,Warning!,"While the steel post itself is a great post, the pre-drilled holes DO NOT match the mailbox that it is pair/sold with. Further, the bolts that come with it to attach to the mailbox are too big for the mail box. Unless you want to pay extra for someone to re-drill the holes in the box to match the post, BUY SOMETHING MADE IN JAPAN INSTEAD! AMERICANS CLEARLY CAN'T COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH TO BUILD A MAILBOX AND POST!"
5,Functional & Usable Information,I purchased this book as a graduation gift for a friend in film schooland then I bought myself a copy. I've been using it in productionmeetings to discuss equipment options with my crew and I plan to add itto the list of required reading for all of my production interns.This book really covers an incredible spectrum of production toolsavailable to filmmakers and video users alike.
5,Great Gadgets!,This book is full of toys that I didn't even knew existed. I was really impressed with the depth of product and information that they gathered in this book. There is some great gear in this book that I have to get. It contained things that I never would have imagined. And they will help speed up and drastically improve my next film shoot. Good find.
1,I Am a Genius: Please Read My Review,I just threw this book off my balcony while screaming about how profoundly ridiculous it is. Now how do I apply for an NEA grant?
3,Good Color,"Easy to assemble and appears good. But I question about the quality of the material. The Door knobs came off on the first day, but since I had some spare knobs, I substituted it."
3,its informative...,ive read like 10 guides in this vien. this one should b read with other guides. its not the only guide u need.
1,a joke of a book of poetry from a joke publisher,"I reviewed another book from this publisher which I also found equally dull and lacking art. Both, in fact, I found in a bargain barrel of sorts, most likely thrown away by someone who found as equally painful to read as I. Harrison's work wants to be inventive, ingenious and artful, but in the end he doesn't really offer up much of a challenge to his work and simply falls into very unmemorable prose brokwn into lines."
3,Works OK but not fabulous,"I bought this receiver to pair with an Archos 70 Internet tablet (which runs Android 2.2 currently) for use with CoPilot Live USA (GPS program which includes full off-line maps).I live in New York City, and the receiver generally cannot find the satellites when I'm walking amongst the tall buildings (even though I have an open view to the sky). It works better if I can find a clearing. It's not as good at initial acquisition as my Garmin Nuvi dedicated GPS unit.Pros:- small size- holds a charge for a long time (just did a roadtrip to Boston and back over the course of a week plus local driving in Boston, total usage time 8-10 hours on a single charge)- paired easily via Bluetooth with my tabletCons:- issues finding satellites described aboveSummary:I got this unit when they were running a sub-$20 deal on it. At that price, I consider it to be a pretty good bargain. At full price, I don't think I'd be satisfied with it."
5,Great Little Piece of Tech!,"Does what it says, and well. Works great on my jailbroken iPod Touch 4g when paired with programs like TomTom and Navigon. Way cheaper than buying a separate device for me since I had the Touch already. Extra plus: no need to download/pay for map updates or worry about my gps loosing support. Highly recommended."
1,Used came with no charger,"Bought it used, didn't have charger so I have no idea if it even works. Be careful buying used. The end"
2,"Works, but not worth the money","Once you have powered this on it works well enough. When it loses bluetooth connection to whatever it is talking to it shuts off. When the client comes back this unit has to be manually powered on again. It is also very expensive for an older tech receiver. Look for a modern SIRF III, or better, receiver that stays on so long as it is powered."
1,NO SUPPORT - USELESS FOR MY SMARTPHONE,"I tried this device with my Samsung Galaxy S class smartphone and was unable to use the item due to the unavailability of support and software for my device. In all fairness, there may be devices it might work with but in my case it was useless. I was extremely disappointed with TomTom support. It took (literally) days to get through to their telephone support, then when I did reach someone they seemed unaware of this product. They further advised that ""it is discontinued.""I would recommend avoiding this product due to lack of support - both software support and technical support."
2,"Didn't care for it at all, she pursued the guy the entire book","Shesh, the heroine kept throwing herself at the guy the entire time, sending him gifts and slept with him, but he hated her family (and her). I realize it was the love of her life and all, but she shoulda had more self respect."
4,Wicked indeed!!,"At times, it seems that Jo Beverley LIVED that era! Such is her mastery of the details of everything.. She writes the way an artists composes a masterpiece.. all the details make sense, all the strokes add something. Everything is one unit, beautiful, exciting, charming, addictive, and consuming.I didn't know that this book was part of a serie when I bought it.. I'm dying to read about the rest of them.. Rothgar especially.. This is excellent reading. Different, refreshing, unexpected and never boring."
2,Disappointing...,"Something wicked is something not worth reading. It started out OK but then got ridiculous, then got better, even quite exciting, but then it just went staedily downhill from there. I tried to like Elf and Fort (WHERE did she pull out these names though??) but the characters seemed shallow and see-through. I did not feel any of Fort's pain nor did I think Elf was a compassionate, soft-hearted lady. She was just a ditz, mostly a pushy ditz. Pass on this one. Read Beverley's outstanding LORD OF MIDNIGHT and FORBIDDEN MAGIC instead."
5,"""Something Wicked"" is Something Special....","Beverley's ""Something Wicked"" is something special in romance fiction. As always, her heroines delight, and her heroes entice. And this book, yet another in the Malloren series, is full of all the exciting plot twists and intriguing characters those books are known for. But this time, the Malloren in question is a girl...And such a girl. Elfled Malloren, a likeable girl with much to recommend her, finds herself unaccountably drawn to a man who holds her entire family in abject contempt. Just how does she woo and win her man, against such obstacles? Well, I'd love to tell you but I'd hate to spoil the surprises for you!"
4,My gosh,"This is one of the raciest Regency books I've ever read, and I've read a lot! Beware, this is definitely not for those faint-hearted readers :-) I liked the characters and found it interesting that the heroine, Elf, sometimes had more power than the hero, especially towards the end.Again, this is a very wicked book and the wickedness really suits the characters and the situation so it's not there for the sake of sensationalism. I don't give it a 5, though, because at times I wanted to strangle one particular character for his stubbornness."
3,I don't use it anymore,"I found this item to be too bulky - if you insist on having a retractable leash, go with the flexi products. For the price though it seemed okay. Anyway, I don't use it anymore because we've gone to using a regular utility leash, after getting rope burn a few times when my dog would go crazy and start running around in circles. Fun for him (since he has all that freedom that a 15ft leash can give him) but no fun for me."
4,as simple as is,"It's a step up ring, ment to use with 67mm filter on 62mm lens. As a ring nothing wrong with it. The only problem I run in to, the hood doesn't fit, if you instal it."
5,Jackson Browne Going Home.,"Going Home 1994 Dir Janice Engel. Feat.Jackson Browne , and Scott Thurston Special appearances-David Lindley,David Crosby,Graham Nash,Jennifer Warnes Don Henley,Bonnie Raitt .90 minutes. A autobiographical documentary on this humble man.Featuring rare footage,interveiws,and melodic performances. Highlights include, I'm Alive (93),Doctor My Eyes (71),Birds of St. Marks written about Nico,singer of Velvet Underground (never released) World In Motion (89),about Appartheid in South Africa,Lives in the Balance (86) a favorite, often featured in Miami Vice,Nash and Crosby make a memorable appearance.Originally aired in August of 1994, thanks to the Disney Channel , it is a definite must for any JB fan. Mark Phillip Stassen."
5,MUST HAVE if you are a fan.....,"Well if you really enjoy Jackson or even if you are a casual fan of his, this is a MUST own for you. Right now only out in VHS, the DVD version (coming real soon) will be that much more worth owning. The feature not only includes live performances of Jackson ,,, but more importantly provides a history and gets into his mind and you will actually witness his evolution from the early years through the polital era of his to the present. Don't think about this one .. buy it."
5,Delightful Children's Story!,"A lovely lunch fixed by Mrs. Fish for Mr. Fish, Walter, Arabella and baby Clarissa is rudely crashed by a rubber boot, which falls off the little boy ""Upstairs"" who's fishing with his sister. Even the youngest child will understand the big joke that the Fish family plays on the boy and girl. The illustrations of the Fish family are what make this book special, especially baby Clarissa, wearing a white bonnet and dress, in a bassinet. I loved it as a child, my daughter enjoyed it, and my four year old granddaughter laughed out loud at the ending."
2,Omega 369 has forula changed?,Have used these pills only 3 dogs for 3 years. Never any problems. This batch I got from you are a different color much lighter in color than the ones I had from before and my dogs began to have the runs one of the bottles had a crooked label. Hope these are the real thing? We found that we can give it to them every other day without issues have they changed the formula? Omega 369 for dogs
4,soft gel dog omega 3,"Recieve it today in a good condition. Don't have chance to try it yet, but think the product is really good. Smell the bottle, the odor is not stinky like another brand."
3,Allergic Reaction,"This product is probably o.k. for most dogs but not for mine. I'm writing to caution others who have small dogs. I have a Yorkie and after taking one capsule prescribed every other day by our Vet for dry skin, she had a severe allergic reaction last night after taking only one pill. She's on benadryl now and I hope that works. My guess (and it's only a guess) is that she is just too small (11 lbs) to take an entire capsule. To make sure, I won't be giving her anymore Omega 3, 6, 9."
3,"Soft and comfy, but too thin","These socks are soft and comfy and seem well made, but are too thin. I got used to my other Gold toe thick terry socks."
4,Soft!,Very nice socks - plenty of cushion & wearing well so far. The real test will be this winter when I wear socks all the time.
2,You do get what you pay for...,"These socks feel kind of cheap to me, and thin. They do stay up well but...not so cushioned in the toe as described. My own fault. I will go and purchase others that cost a bit more but have that softer, not grainy, if you know what I mean, feeling."
3,Good Everyday Sock,I have worn these socks for years. They are good for everyday use around home. I wouldn't recommend them for sports as they tend to stretch out after a while and bunch up in your shoes.
5,Excellent product,Nice thick sock for winter. Well made. Wears and washes well so far. Pull up or fold down is nice versatility.I'm planning on buying another set.
1,Not Recommended,"Although this book does portray chores associated with farming accurately, this Barney book has the worst photography I have seen. Apparently some of the photos were taken very late in the day, by the length of the shadows, which makes the pictures light-deprived. Also, many of the photos are simply extremely dark, even those inside the barn, losing details to muddiness - certainly not a child-friendly picture book.Factually, the ""cow"" pictured is really a heifer, and not capable of being milked.I also think value of the phrase ""Aye yie yie!"" used by BJ two times is questionable; why not easily read phrases like ""Wow"", ""Gosh"", ""Golly"", ""My Goodness"", or ""Jeepers""?There are many good books for preschoolers about life on a farm - this is not one of them."
2,Not the Best of Barney,"We love Barney and have lots of Barney materials in our home. This book however has never been a favorite and I am not exactly sure why. Perhaps it has something to do with the pictures. As someone noted previously some of them are darkish. In addition, I would also say that some have parts that are out of focus, while others just have a strange color contrast to them.That said, this Barney book covers a *typical* farm day with activities such as milking, feeding the animals, and picking vegetables. It covers familiar farm places and animals: home, barn, rooster, horse, hay, cows, hens and eggs, tractor, corn, scarecrow, and vegetables. It just doesn't do it in Barney style and I would suggest that you just give this one a pass.Pam T~mom and reviewer at BooksforKids-reviews"

1,Worst of the Barney books I've seen,"The last reviewer is absolutely right. The pictures are too dark. Vivid descriptions of the sun are given, but not even a picture of the sun. Don't even get this one at the library."
3,Consciousness?,"given the author and his research interests for the last 15 years, I expected a direct evaluation/presentation of a theory of consciousness. Instead, one gets a review of visual neuroscience. Of course, he and Kotch have made it clear they will use the visual system as a starter to finding the neural correlates of consciousness. But even so, one must be disappointed. Crick reviews his ""searchlight hypothesis"", which actually received some support at the end of the nineties. He also proposes the Gamma band ocillation theory, and that too has suport (in a way), importantly through the work of LLinas and W. Singer. Synchronization and temporal binding is a hot and promissing field. The book is an interesting read, despite my negative comments. A consciousness studies must, alongside Edelman and Damasios work."
5,Should be required reading for high school...,"This is an excellent book by a working scientist. It shows a scientist at work, looking for answers. It demonstrates what answers are and how to find them. It addresses a topic that everyone is interested in, but few actually know anything about. I highly recommend it. It is a bit dry and technical, but after all the nonsense and fluff written on this subject, the change is delightful."
4,rich and interesting,"This book is important for people who wants to know more about current progresses in neuroscience. I especially like chapter 12 where Crick provides a lot of examples on how patients with brain injuries would behave differently from normal. I think these evidences make his ""hypothesis"" much more convincing. However, his treatment on nonlinear dynamics, neural network and learning mechanism is too brief and insufficient. Perhaps he does not want his book becomes too technical, but I think these topics are important for readers to understand the richness of information patterns in human brains."
1,He sees only what his worldview allows him to see,"The evidence that his arguments are littered with fallacious arguments is overwhelming, just in the first few pages - which is admittedly all I read. If you are an atheist, Darwinian, naturalist, guess what!? We don't have any souls! Imagine that! The only thing astonishing is that this was published, but I forget, he won a Nobel prize, so he could write ""poop"" on a piece of toilet paper and get it published. At least that would be less harmful to the public's opinion of the interaction of science and God."
2,Movie is Good But DVD is Bad,"One of the better made for TV movies, but the DVD copy I got is of a poor quality (although watchable)!If your a Val Fan its worth the low end price! Otherwise if you want a better than VHS quality recording then pass on this one and wait for the 2nd generation print!"
3,The Promise Of Love,"I thought this movie was pretty good considering it was a made for TV movie. I am a big Valerie Bertinelli fan so, I enjoyed viewing this film and giving a positive review on it. Her acting skills were excellent and it was her first TV movie while still appearing on One Day At A Time.I highly recommend this film to any Valerie Bertinelli fan. You won't be disappointed."
2,LAURA MERCER LIP SILK,THE PRODUCT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SQUEEZE FROM THE TUBE. I ALSO AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE RESULTS. THE QUANTITY IS ALSO DISAPPOINTING.
3,GangBusters,"This is a very good for the begining roleplayer. Easy to follow rules and quick action. This game is also advanced enough to keep an expaenced roleplayer in hours of fun, without haveing to stress about rules"
2,Need a magnifying glass to see the cards,"Although this game is very inexpensive, you get what you pay for in this case. Even though it has a ""password"" feature, it doesn't save your ""bank"" and the cards are so small in the GMA version, you need a magnifying glass to see them in some of the games. If you like slot machines or video poker and don't care if you have to start from scratch each time you play, and don't have trouble seeing really small numbers, then it's worth the money."
1,disappointing,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It is pretty much a general ""how to succeed in life"" book ubiquitous in book stores everywhere with the pretext of apologizing for non-moral behavior( i.e.worship of status and reputation) in justifying the ends, a supposed more Christian nation. This book does not state anything new nor does it challenge or inspire. Let me save you some money and offer you alternative advice: Work ridiculously hard, put Christ the King above all, and success will come to you."
2,Ehhhh.....,"I am on my 3rd X427. For the past 4 months, I have had nothing but problems. My first the phone would freeze up, and the buttons would be pressed randomly. My second phone, when I was on GRPS, it turned off and when I turned it back on it said ""Phone Locked, Return for Servicing"" and The 3rd time, the phone turned off, and even when I held the power button down, it would not turn on. After changing the battery 2 times, and having it work for only a few days, I said enough, and brought it back to the cingular store.SAMSUNG MAKE BETTER PHONES!"
2,Avoid this phone - you get what you pay for,I agree that the microphone is a bit sensative. It is hard to talk with one hand on phone - hard to hear especially if you have a slip-on case that covers the microphone/ear piece. I have alot of dropped calls (Metro Atlanta area) and widely/almost constantly varying signal strength. Avoid this phone - when I asked Cingular for warranty repair/exchange they were quick to offer a telephone upgrade !!!
4,Solid phone,"I have had this phone for about 3 months and have been very happy. I love the light weight and compact size of it, even though it didn't come with an exterior caller ID screen(wanted that but not a camera). I've always been pleased with Samsung phones and this is no exception. Aside form a couple minor things, like a lack of plain, audible ringtones and some menu options, this is a solid, reliable phone. I get great battery life and good reception, in areas that Sprint PCS couldn't. Customer service hasn't been a problem, other than wait times. Overall this is a great phone. As an aside, I would add that the customer who complained about the visibility of the screen in sunlight, probably had not adjusted the contrast, which is an option under the phone settings menu."
2,Wouldn't Recommend,"I bought this phone last June and have had nothing but problems with it. I tried returning it to the store which I bought it from the very next day and that was a whole other fiasco. I had Motorola phones up until this point and was very satisfied with my cell phone carrier and the phones I had. This phone bittered my experience with both. Unfortunately, I am now stuck in a cell phone contract for another year and a half with a phone which doesn't work majority of the places I am."
1,Cannot see screen in sunlight,We updated our phone but went the wrong way. Do not try to see the phone book outside in bright sunlight. You cannot see the screen. This is a terrible phone for use outside in the sun. I never had this problem with my Motorola. I do not recommend this for outside use. It is cute but not functional.
1,Poor Product!!!,"I am currently on my second X427, and I am greatly disappointed with the product. I haven't done anything to cause the phone to malfunction, yet both phones have provided me with poor service and far more headaches than any other phone I've used before (including several Nokias and a Motorola). I do not recommend this phone, and the number of phones in my home state that have been returned to Cingular stores outnumbers the number of phones originally purchased. I believe that this speaks volumes about the product."
1,Don't Even Think About It!,"This phone is trash, pure & simple. The screen on mine began to bleed 2 days after purchase. Cingular's response - ABUSE - nothing we can do, blah, blah, blah. Anyone who's been with Cingular knows the drill here, worst customer service in the industry, but that's another review. My wife & daughter both had the same phone on Cingular's Family Plan. I say HAD even though I'm still under contract because my daughter's doesn't work at all & my wife's won't disconnect for up to 5 minutes after the call has ended. 3 Samsung X427's, none working properly (or at all) after a year. My other daughter's LG, which we got at the same time, from the same horrible provider, works great.Avoid this phone, or for that matter any Samsung phone, and Cingular Wireless, like the plague!"
2,Don't even THINK of trying to read your screen outside...,It's like many notepads - your screen is invisible in the sun.
3,Not as great as I thought,"Have had this phone for a year now.Pros: It's cute and light-weight.Con: If you download ringtones they play at a really low volume.The vibrating alert can't be felt unless it's up against your bare skin almost (don't even think about putting it in the pocket of your tightest pair of jeans).Keep the charger handy at all times.After a while the dialing is delayed (you dial a number, it takes up to 40 seconds before the numbers actually pop up on the screen and dial).When you open the case, the screen display can be delayed also, but up to as much as 1 minute."
2,not so good compared to others,"I had this phone for a while with my company thru Cingular and I hated it. Constantly dropped calls, couldn't get a good signal. I switched to a Sony-Ericsson for my personal account and couldn't be happier. In the SAME coverage area, I never lose a signal or call on my Sony-Ericsson phone."
2,Hands-free doesn't work....,"I purchased this phone as an upgrade and had nothing but problems with the hands-free device. We tried three different phones and seven ear pieces. Either I couldn't hear who I was calling, they couldn't hear me or the phone would indiscriminately dial a number or disconnect a call. I am back to searching for a phone I can live with!"
3,Why!,"Why wasn't three little bears on the south saturn delta release. It is an excellent tune. this would have been better if there were more tunes on this release like the studio version of star spangled banner. anyway, we now have a good copy of three little bears. One question though, where is In the West and the Berkley concerts?"
5,MERRY X-MAS & HAPPY YEAR CD,WORTH THE MONEY A MUST HAVE FOR THE COLLECTOR AND HARDCORE FAN LIKE ME I HAVE THE 45 RECORD OF THIS VERSION AND JUST ORDERED THIS ONE JIMI HENDRIX IS THE BEST NOW AND FOREVER.
3,Short and not so great,"I am the biggest Hendrix fan on earth, but I was somewhat disappointed in this CD. For one thing it was 16 minutes long with basically two takes of the same three songs (Little Drummer Boy, Silent Night, and Auld Lang Syne). They also threw in the most God-Awful Hendrix tune of all time: Three Little Bears. I get depressed hearing the song, because you can tell halfway through that Jimi is wanting to trash the song, but evidently someone is coaxing him to finish his lyrics. He basically talks through the last few lines. I hate that song. I guess if you down a couple of drinks and sit back and just play the two takes of the above mentioned 3 songs, it is okay."
2,Not much bang for the buck,"I bought this CD when I spotted it Christmas shopping one day because I wanted to kind of ""stir things up"" a bit and add some novelty and variety to the usual repetitive selection of Christmas songs that get played in my family around this time of year.But I was highly disappointed to find that this so-called ""Hendrix Christmas Album"" that the store had a big sign up promoting actually only consists of 3 songs, 2 of which are in fact the exact same medley played twice in different takes, and with the remaining song having absolutely nothing to do with Christmas.I feel very ripped off and feel like I payed the price of an album just to get one so-so song.Don't be as dumb as me.'Nuff said."
3,Mis-understood Man,"The problem with alot of Jimi's later songs is that they were works in progress. In reference to Three Little Bears, he didn't dislike the song; it more than likely was that one verse in the song that was bothering him."
1,WORST HENDRIX CD EVER!!!!!!!,This Merry Christmas CD is a waste of my time. I dont know why this was released. Hendrix is on this CD and I will not reject him and say he sucks but the way they made this CD sucks. I was very disapointed believe me I own every Hendrix CD and this one is not worth buying others may like it but I dont!! I encourage you not to buy this for its just a short CD. The jamming still is cool on it but I can not give it more than a 1 its an below average CD. This should not have been released so if you want to buy this think again.
3,"Silent Night, Holy Night, All Is Cool, Man!",Not bad. I would say that this item is for hard-core Jimi fans like myself. An interesting oddity - nice to have on CD. I have the original on vinyl but don't dare play it for fear of scratching it - now I can pop in the CD whenever I want.
4,Mine came without a cover,"This CD features two versions of Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsies jamming on Christmas songs. It is a loose jam session where they play instrumental versions of ""Little Drummer Boy"", ""Silent Night"", ""Auld Lang Syne"" and ""Taps"" (although ""Taps"" is not listed on the CD). The extended version here features more of ""Silent Night"" tacked on the end, that seems to be grafted from a different take. If you are a fan of Jimi's feedback drenched guitar playing, you should get a kick out of this. The other song here is theElectric Ladylandouttake ""Three Little Bears"". As Jimi himself says during the song, it has silly lyrics, but his guitar playing is great. It is an inconsequential, but fun song."
4,i dug this,it's not for everybody but the feeling&vibe that Jimi&the crew hit here is tight for me.it's mainly for folks wanting to collect any released music from Jimi.it's another CHapter into the Great Mind of Jimi Hendrix.
3,"Poorly written, but the only game in town","This is the only book I've found so far that's just about the CSET single subject English test, which is why I didn't return it to the book store. Not only were there a number of typos, but some of the advice they give about grammar is just plain wrong. For example, they want you to write ""If Johnny (or whoever) were responsible, then he should pay."" In fact, the way their sentence is written, it's quite likely that Johnny was responsible, so it shouldn't be subjunctive mode.The other sections, such as the section about historic literary periods, are informative if hard to read. Use your Strunk and White to brush up on grammar and punctuation, and let me know if you find another study guide for this."
1,Misleading Title,"This is the only book I've found so far that claims to help you prepare for the CSET English--and I still returned it, because I need time to study seriously, not wonder why the information given in this book is so broad, or whether or not it is really accurate. I compared it to the sample test and English Subject Matter Requirements provided by the official CSET website and was disappointed to find that it did not quite match up."
1,EXTREME Waste of time-Regressive!,"This book is not only incompetent, it is racist, homophobic, andhas creepy religious undertones. Furthermore, Amazon deleted my review saying so, and not only my review, but that of another reviewer who protested the book's sexist language. Well, the book's sloppy organization, bad punctuation, and horrific spelling mistakes should be enough to scare any reader away."
5,Baby duck is great,"Baby Duck is an everyman (everyduck?) who, without expecting it, finds himself led into a great adventure. Kind of like Frodo in Lord of the Rings (well, maybe not exactly). Anyway, the book is very engaging. The text is well-written and literate, and the illustrations are gorgeous. At first glance they appear a little cartoonish, but on closer examination you can easily see many subtle features, including Baby Duck's facial expressions and those of the other characters (except for the new friend, who is rubber!). I gave this book to several young friends this Christmas and it was very enthusiastically received. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Wonderful movie,This movie is for all baseball fans and especially people who know something about ultra orthodox jewish sects. It was a very good movie with somewhat of a twist ending.
4,My four year old lover its.,"This excavator is a pretty good replication of the real excavator. All the levers are pretty strong, so it appears it will last for a while. I'll update this comment in 6 months to let you know if the toy survived."
4,Caterpiller Excavator,My grandson has had a lot of fun with this excavator and he's pretty rough with his toys.I'd recommend this to others.
5,Grandson's Favorite,I gave our 2 year old grandson the Caterpillar small Excavator and it quickly became his favorite toy! It is durable and very like the actual excavator working on a project near our home. Amazon delivered my purchase very quickly much to my satisfaction.
5,A HUGE hit!,We bought this truck for our grandson's third birthday and it was a HUGE hit! He carried it everywhere with him for several days and even insisted on taking it to bed. Like most young boys he can be pretty rough on his toys and this seems very sturdy for inside or outside play. I was concerned about the pinched fingers that other reviewers mentioned but this has not been a problem. I think three and up is a good guideline because younger toddlers might not have the coordination yet to operate it with the handle.
1,OUCH!!!,"When I purchased this for Christmas, I dismissed the other review that mentioned pinched fingers, thinking to myself that their child must be too young for the toy, or it was an isolated incident. Well, my 3 yr. old just ran into the den screaming and holding out his pinched finger. It is pinched so badly that the skin is blue and protruding (sticking out) in the pinched position even a few minutes after it happened. He immediately pointed to this toy and is now reluctant to play with it again. Money wasted."
