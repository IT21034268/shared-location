3,A little dry,"I don't know if mine were old or what, but they are not very moist, and you need moist. Nice price and this is a lot of wipes for sure, I guess I am stuck with them for the next year."
3,Not as good as the unscented,"I have always used the unscented wipes from pampers and decided to try the scented ones for a change. I use a wipes warmer which works very well with all kinds of wipes except this one. The scented ones seem to dry up very very quickly. I, almost always, had to discard the top wipe and use the next one so it would be moist. Would not recommend it if you are planning to use with a wipes warmer."
2,Majesty flex Wafers,I'm not doubting that this is a good product but my horse won't touch these things with a ten foot pole. Even if I crumble them into apple sauce he won't eat it. I thought I'd try them because in the summer my horse is mainly on pasture with no grain and I didn't want to have to mix different supplements each day. Could be just my horse...but he REALLY likes applesauce and it surprised me that he still wouldn't eat the crumbled wafer. The wafers are a great concept...just not for my horse!Majesty's Flex Wafers Joint therapy for horses 60 count bag
3,My horse spits it out.,"These wafers look like they would be delicious, but my horse doesn't seem to like them. I'm actually using them to break him of his nibbling/biting habit because he's always looking to be hand fed. I gave it three stars because I think that the ingredients are good, but I have to crumble the wafer and mix it in with his grain in order to get him to eat it. I think next time I'll buy a supplement that you measure and add to the food."
2,Not for beginner,"These three DVD's are great for an accomplished guitar player. I am a high intermediate and love the music, but definitely difficult to play."
3,"They only changed the title and the cover!,","_This is not so much a review as it is a warning. If you are expecting this to be the possible second book of synchronicity stories that is mentioned at the back of the author's first collection (_Soul Moments_,1997) then you will be disappointed. This is exactly the same book, only with a different title and cover. Even the author's dedication is the same._Don't get me wrong, it is an exellent book on synchronicity- one of the best that I've read, but it is highly deceiving to repackage it again like this so soon. In fact, I can only assume that this was done to fool people into paying for the same book twice- I know that I did...."
2,Does not fit IS300,"The manufacturer states that this exhaust will fit a Lexus IS300, but when I had it installed, it was about 3 to 4 inches too long and had to be cut and welded. Also, the angles of the pipe flanges were a bit off to be a direct replacement for the Lexus OEM part. Not the easy replacement I was expecting it to be."
1,"Problematic, Offensive Film","Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously problematic in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to hit every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer."
2,Pass the Soap,"This wasn't a bad bit of film-making. It is a foreign film and it has a somewhat under-developed plot. The acting is slightly better than daytime soaps, but it is kinda cute in its own way. I wouldn't recommend it to someone seeking a good film on trans-related topics or drama. It is what it purports to be, a soap-opera."
2,broken...,"bad choice...2d film would not play at all. i have a new dvd player even...no other disks had probs.tip riding good ..endless malibu,just...endless."
4,A Viewer,"I strongly disagree with the common perception of people's opinion with this film. To me, this about a psychological side to the ""Rambos,"" and other one man army type soldiers of war. It shows how deeply troubled they are with the world, and other dilemmas that have occurred with their private lives. I think this story is more of a tale between a son with a father who is mentally ill. I think the Vietnam War is just a story that occurred and had a part of the drama. It's something that just makes this man more interesting in his character. The fact that he was a former Navy Seal unfortunately makes him much more dangerous to the rest of societyI think people dislike films like this the most because they feel uncomfortable being in the face of mental illness. I assume it's much more comfortable for them to turn their back."
2,Distant Thunder,"I watched the movie because I am a Ralph Macchio fan as well as a fan of John Lithgow. The scenery was good, the story line was the same old thing about a vet returning to civilian life. Nothing new here."
2,Lithgow is great the film... is not,John Lithgow gives a good performance in this highly rehashed film. It is not new or refreshing.. it is a typical 'nam movie. If you are a die hard Lithgow fan I would suggest watching some third rock from the sun re runs no one should be subjected to this schlock/
1,Run From This Title!,"I was severely disappointed in this 5 set series. I was hoping to introduce my son to the pleasures of the Three Stooges that I had as a kid, but instead found myself having to cut it off before I soured him on the stooges. The bulk of the segments have ""Curly Joe"", not ""Curly"" and are from the 60s. To compound the offense, GoodTimes Video elected to present the collection on EP mode to save a few cents of tape.In its defense, there are several esoteric clips that the Stoogephile will want in their collection. But you most certainly will not want to use this to introduce your kids to the stooges.Personally, I would like to see any manufacturer that sells video on anything but SP mode taken out and shot(or at least given a 2 finger eye-poke). I was thinking tonight that at least this will be behind us with DVD, but then I realized that they'll just increase the compression ratio to get whatever they want on the disk."
4,A very entertaining and well made album,"I first heard this album when I was stationed in Germany in 1974. It was the first time I had even heard of the band. As soon as I heard it I fell in love with it. I think that the reason I like it so much is that it doesn't sound so polished, but is still forceful. I want this CD!"
4,Great Heavy Rock from early 1970's,"As others have mentioned this is indeed a great proto-metal band from the early 1970's.As such, you'll hear the usual bluesy touches found pretty much on all releases from that time period.Of their two releases this one is known as their ""heavier"" one,and i'd agree with that for the most part.They are both great,though,and I cant see having one and not the other as they're both solid examples of the genre.One point of reference i'd give,and oddly enough hadnt seen before,would be Kiss - not saying they sound like 'em but they were coming from the same place: New York,street-level,heavy ""no frills"" rock N roll played LOUD.No fan of Hard Rock should be without both Dust releases!"
1,Dont waste your money,"It seems to protect my computer alright. However I constantly have problems when I startup. It has problems updating, and constantly says my user ID is incorrect. However when I restart several times this gets straight. Also I have to turn off the firewall each time I log on to Hotmail and some other webpages since I still havent figured out how to allow them. Also the parental controls are total crap. It would be nice if it would block what it says it does and if you could put in whatever addresses you wanted."
3,very very shady,I gave them a 3 because of something shady they pulled in an email to me.they told me it was time to renew and i would receieve a very great discount if i renewed for another year.so i said sure went to they're website.and entered the client code and guess what.NO discount at all the we going to charge me full price FULL PRICE and that includes no cd and no book and no box.so why the hell should i renew with them when i can buy the oem version of they're product at much bigger discount and get the cd???
2,don't download,"I bought the CD last year and had no trouble at all. The product was absolutely wonderful. Then, I downloaded the update from the website this year and had nothing but trouble until I uninstalled it. They did issue a full refund. I may try the physical product again."
2,Slows down computer,Not as good as McAfee or Norton. Slows down computer tremendously. Hard to remove from computer.
1,WARNING,"After being unable to successfully install this software on our computer (for some reason, the software thinks our computer has less than the required minimum 128 megabytes of RAM, when it has 2.5 GIGABYTES of RAM), we called Panda Software. Please note: THERE IS NO TOLL FREE NUMBER FOR THIS COMPANY IN THEIR PACKAGE INSERTS. The representative we spoke with informed us that the software WILL NOT WORK on systems with more than two gigabytes of RAM. Personally, I would recommend buying a different antivirus program."
5,The Best,"This software was recommended by the man who fixed my computer. He said this was the BEST!I have tried them all, and this one is the BEST! It catches everything, and takes care of it, and lets you know what it was!Love it! Recommend it to everyone."
3,A decent quality import,"Fairly good sound quality for an imported live CD; lots of instrumentals, but a few choice tracks that are excellent. Great cover of Kansas City."
5,A diamond that wants to stay coal,"Diogenes is Tom's lawn-jockey. He proves himself, again, an honest man. Any popster would have taken 10 or 12 years to over-produce this collection into at least 8 albums. ""Orphans"" is a diamond that wants to stay coal."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I like the content of this set, but not its organization. I enjoy Tom's ballads as much as anybody, but I like them interspersed with other things for contrast. An entire disc full of nothing but ballads lacks any sort of tension/release progression and is difficult for even the most hardcore fan to get through in one sitting. I assume most kids these days will simply rip all three discs to their iPod and put it on shuffle mode anyway, but I think this release could have benefitted greatly from a a little less forced homogenization."
1,Whatever happened to the Troubadour,"Ever since Tom went into the barn to make his music, he's been painful to listen to. I understand his need to pursue improvisational meanderings, using anything available to bang on, but I miss the old Tom. I guess he thinks of it as progress, but to my pedestrian ears, it just hurts. I want him to go back into the Heart of Saturday Night."
2,For Confirmed Waits Fans only.,"Look, I'm a Tom Waits fan, but most of this album was pretty inaccessible to me. When you get to a certain level as a musician and song writer you get to do an album like this because your recording label probably has to let you. Tom has probably wanted to do this for a long time, but I think he is mostly talking (muttering actually) to himself here. If you are really, really, really into his work this may be signature stuff, but I think most people will not be able to get much from this.I don't regret buying it, because I like to look into his pretty amazing head, and if you have a copy it will no doubt be a collector's item in 20 years---but it will be because you will be one of only a few dozen owners."
1,sounds like a mean old drunk,"I feel that these songs are simply not musical enough. Raw and real yes, but that's the best I can say about it."
1,"It sucks,but then again what do you expect?","Tom Waits is the most overrated,undertalented jerk in the history of music.Every time my husband listens to this,I almost go into seizures,it sucks so much.I'm thinking about leaving him over this garbage."
4,Latest Waits,"This latest release for Tom Waits is a 3 disc set. Disc 3 is the one that really makes the set shine. It contains songs with similar sound to tracks from ""Real Gone"". They are raw, juicy, and warped. Disc 2 is mellow and works well when a mellow sound is called for. Disc 1 is a little hit or miss. Listen to the samples."
5,Another Masterpiece from Mr Waits,What else can you say except WOW! This guy has got to be the most underated song writer/musician/artist et al of all time. Every thing he has put out since Closing time has been a four or five star album and this is no exception. This is THE BEST ALBUM OF 2006.
3,Just can't get too wound up over this one,"It's got to be pretty clear to anyone with objectivity that amazon reviews are largely written by the choir. I don't care whether it's trash from the likes of J. Timberlake or genius from an artist like Tom Waits. As for this latest offering, I can only say that it could have been a classic 1 disc set (containing only the best songs, of course) or a pretty good 2 disc set. The disc entitled ""Bastards"" is on the lean and forgettable side, with the other two having their moments in the sun. Given the price, I'm hard pressed to think that it's really worth it. As Frank Zappa once said, ""all an artist has to do is fart and drop a drumstick and the audience will go wild""....or something close to that."
5,Estranho e bom,"Adorei! Um disco de jazz como de costume flertando bem de perto com o blues, Tom Waits interpreta antigos clássicos de um jeito que só ele poderia. Os arranjos so incríveis."
5,Great Retrospective,"This is a must have for any die hard Tom Waits fan. COvers the many sides of this unique man and his music. As all great artist, Tom is often misunderstood, but there is no denying what an amzing talent this man possesses."
3,Tom Waits for no one,"Let's be clear, I have the greatest respect and admiration for Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan's songwriting. This is a patchy collection with many excellent songs and many not so. It doesn't engage the way Waits better albums have done. Nuff said."
3,Tom Waits Review,"The first disc is absolutely outstanding! Love the bluesy Louis Armstrong voice and the taunting lyrics. I Iisten to it all the time and I'm getting to know the words. These are classics! They should be out in the world. However disc 2 and 3, is this the same artist? They are sentimental, slow songs. My mother, age 83, loved those songs on dics 2 and 3. I bought the album because I had heard disc 1 playing at a coffee shop in Bodega Bay,Ca. and I asked who was that artist? And they told me it was Tom Waits, his latest album, and that he was a local. So I bought it!"
5,Orphans,Kind of like riding a horse drunk. My boss borrowed it last week and has been trying to sound like Tom Waits ever since. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this album. Even deaf people can find comfort in the reverberations that his voice gives off.
5,This is the best album of the year.,"We've had some great albums this year - Bob Dylan's Modern Times is definitely in my top five and the new release by The Beatles named Love is superb. But it is Waits' three-disc album of rarities and oddities that is my personal favorite. This is an amazing collection. It's some of the best stuff Waits has released in decades. It has something for everyone - classics for the purists, experimental stuff for the Mule Variations crowds, and general rarities for enthusiasts. Superb, beautiful, moving, bitter, emotional: a real standout. Love it."
4,something for everyone,"after listening to this for a while now i have to say that some of the music on this disc is some of the best tom has written and some of the worst. but of course with this much music you're bound to disagree a little bit. but the big plus of this one is it has something for everyone whether you like the ruff stuff disc 1, the ballads disc 2, or his experimental stuff disc 3, the thing most of even the hardcore waits fans dont like all 3 and when your paying 30 to 40 dollars for the cd thats a big deal. so i would reccomend this one after buying a few other waits albums."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"Absolutely Amazing! Mr. Waits' talents are demonstrated completely on all 3 discs. Granted, not all of these tracks are something that you'd play for someone who has never heard of Tom Waits, but together, the set flows like very few box-sets/compilations do. Most are hits packages with b-sides and/or demos thrown in, whereas Orphans sounds just like a Waits album should, with all of the musical beauty and surprises, and a scruffy voice to keep it from getting the least bit pretentious. As for the lack of printed lyrics, it is a shame, but I would contend that it will make the listener listen that much harder, to get the full effect. The only thing I dislike about this set is that I'm now REALLY dying to see Mr. Waits play a show here in Syracuse."
4,Other seller,This was my 1st time using another seller for a used item (CD box set) and even if one of the cd is showing finger prints they are playing ok. Shipping was not as fast as an Amazon purchase.
3,Quantity over quality,"A bit disappointing. As usual with Tom Waits, some of the tracks are great -- Lucinda and Goodnight Irene are standouts. But too many, while not bad, are kinda ho-hum. With editing, this would have made a better 2-disc set, or a really good single CD."
5,excellent desk chair,"I love this chair! My 2 year old does, too. So do all her friends and relatives! Also, when toys go missing in our house, this is the best place to look. Our daughter loves to secret her older siblings' Pokemon under her seat!"
1,toy was never received for Christmas even when I ordered it in November,"I never got to see the toy. I ordered this product for my God-daughter as a Christmas gift and she never received it. I contacted Amazon and learned that although I had placed this order a month ago, no one took the time to let me know it was not available. Should Amazon had contacted me I could have ordered something in time for Christmas. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon. I am not so sure I would ever order anymore gifts from this website."
2,Over states what it can do!,"I bought this program hoping to print pages for my day timer. It has very few layouts, most of which are not designed for day timers! If you want a scheduling program, you can do better. If you want something that will print pages for your day timer, look elsewhere. I wish I knew where. I'm still using the Delrina Daily Planner that was designed 10 years ago, it at least prints double-sided pages that work in my daytimer!"
1,Uncooperative and Annoying,"I bought Anytime because I already had version 2.0. I liked the earlier version, but many of the things the older version had were either missing or less user friendly in 8.0. I couldn't load the files from version 2.0 directly into the new, (fortunately the old computer is still running so I could manually copy one to the other.) The entry process had a lot of unecessary steps which slowed down the process. Version 2.0 reminds you of missed date entries, the new one doesn't.The version 8.0 has a lot of bells and whistles, like fax/cell/watts numbers, direct connection to e-mail, and a few others. The technical assist to Anytime is non-existant, either by 3 no-responce e-mails or 45 minutes on the phone. I'd stick with version 2.0 if you can load it into your computer, otherwise stick with Outlook."
1,Do not buy if you want support,"Anytime Deluxe 9.0 sounds good for the money. Mine quit working on WinXP after 2 days, and tech support did not reply to my complaint for over a week, when I was given the address to their FAQ page. It contained no helpful information. After calling them, the tech support person admitted there was a problem, and had me modify my registry. The software ran for about 2-3 days, and then stopped working again. I have called and written emails and tech support has not responded in over a week. Even at its best, the software is mediocre - so save your money and buy some software that works and that the company will support."
5,This software is very good for the price,"I have looked all over for some good organizer software. Places like IBM want 80 bucks for lotus organizer. This software is only 30 bucks and does everything i need, sets alarms for appointments, keeps track of my to do list, and keeps addresses. If you want some good organizational software that wont break your piggybank but has a nice looking easy to use interface, this software is great."
2,Short of expectations,"As a musher and adventurer myself, I've been excited for a while to read Norman's book. I was sorely disappointed. In fact, I feel like I lost some respect for Norman in the process. While I respect his accomplishments and admire his youthful spirit, his attitude towards other people bothered me. It seemed like everywhere there was someone battling against him and cutting him down. While this may be the truth, him condemning others through out the whole book was a let down. Overall, I wouldn't reccomend it."
4,Attitude--The Only Thing That Matters--Young or Old,"I read this book on the strong recommendation of Iditarod champion Jeff King, and it was well worth the read, well worth it. Norman Vaughan truly lived a life of adventure in a time the likes of which we are not likely to see again. He did what most people dream of doing, but the difference was attitude and determination. He often comes across as confident, cocky, perhaps, a bit arrogant and pushy, but overall he is a likeable, even admirable guy, especially in his later years. Attitude. That what makes the difference at any age, especially old age. Norman Vaughan qualifies as a great American adventurer. He had the Spirit that made America great, even into his later years. At age 89, to climb a mountain named for you, now that's something. Good read, quick, easy read, and, in the end, quite inspirational and motivating. Ought to be required reading for the AARP crowd!"
5,My 2012 Camaro 6-speed loves this stuff..,"Bought it new and have 4,000 miles now. My first manual tranny in 20 years. I was rusty, but I seemed to be having a hard time finding the right combination of cluch release and gas for 1st and 2nd gear. My skills have improved, but shifting still seemed rough. I changed the fluid to this and wow what a difference. Vastly improved shifting. This is how it shold be! Wish I'd done it sooner.."
4,Power Tool Woodworking for Everyone,A good basic instruction manual with some tips for everyone regardless of their knowledge level. A good addition to my library on the subject.
5,Power Tool Woodworking for Everyone,"This is an owners/users manual for the ""Shopsmith"" woodworking machine itself. Also the power tool attachments that can be used in conjunction w/it. Although this is a 4th edition, and being published in 1989. It pretty much covers all the basics. With lots of valuable tips, suggestions, ideas,pictures, diagrams and even jigs and thoughts for following through on the different attachment functions,and their uses. The book itself was in pretty good shape.(Don't pay $30.00 full price) $3.50 & $4.00 sh&h?!!"
4,Power tool wood working for everyone,This Book is written for ShopSmith owners But the math and formulas can be adjusted to regular woodworking equipment. A great Basic Book to have in your library.
4,Great pre-amp for little money,"I can only assume that the previous reviewer didn't know how to set this thing up. It can be a bit tricky to find the ""sweet spot"" but I prefer this pre-amp to some I have that cost three times the price. The noise-gate seems just about useless to me, but used as a mic pre-amp with a little compression (around 10 dB seems to work best for me) it sounds great."
1,Small form factor piece of useless crapsicle,"Roaring piece of crap for its price, does not work well with condenserate mics either, front end over loads sutpid easy and you have to power reset to get it working again100% mono- my fault for not looking closer - seller was great - no problems at"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is an awful piece of garbage machine. The day I got it I took it out of the box and plugged it in, and I made the most horroundes sound I've ever heard. I tried changing all of my other cables, turning the phantom power off, and many other things, but nothing worked. You should not buy this equipment, even if you are a beginner in recording. It will get you nowhere, only waste a whole lot of time and money."
5,Possibly the Best Album of the Year,"Plaid's ""Not For Threes"" is probably the best album of 1998. Why? Each track has a somewhat unique sound-yet all the tracks flow together to make one album for one great from-the-beginning-to-end listening. I was looking forward to ""Lilith"" the track with Bjork as a guest vocalist the most, but it was Nicholette's vocals on ""Extork"" that surprised me (for the better) the most. The album may take a few listenings to really get into, but once you're into it there's no escape and it was well worth you're time. The first and last tracks are among the best, sounding as if Aphex Twin, Classical music, the Orb, and synth-piano-pop were thrown into a pot and boiled together."
3,"Overrated, but it's easy to listen to","Plaid (aka The Black Dog) are a band that makes techno music palatable for pop fans, and some of their earlier albums like ""Bytes"" were the embodiment of the Warp label's ""Artificial Intelligence"" series. However, ""Not for threes"" shows only little progress, and for the most part, this album is a rather dull affair. All the tracks just lack the pioneering and exciting character of works from similar artists like Autechre and Aphex Twin. It's a bit like easy listening. Not a bad album, but probably I've listened too much too highly experimental techno so I can't appreciate it..."
3,"Nice start, sluggish finish","This was my first experience with Plaid, formerly Black Dog. I procured this album during the midst of my electronica blowout after orienting myself to the genre's landmarks--Autechre, Download, Amon Tobin (too sweet for my tastes) Uziq, etc . . .This album began auspiciously. The first track, abla eedio, harnesses hip-hop techno into a groovy tune. Thereafter, the album gains momentum with ambient funk and engaging soundscrapes. But sadly, the album devolves into a vapid, overzealous menage-- what is Bjork doing on this album? I wish it was more hard-core. Too bad Plaid opted to soften the latter songs, which ruins a worthy effort.For the best electroninca on the market, look into Autechre. Amber and Chiastic Slide is a good place to start."
3,getting real,"Kelly worked her butt off to get into the Italian exchange program. Now that she's there, she isn't sure why. Instead of the glamorous, romantic Roman holiday she was expecting, she finds herself crammed into a small, hot room with 3 other girls. She actually has school assignments to do, and she isn't exactly lucking out in the new friends department. Then she meets Joe. Joe is wild, crazy, uninhibited, and trouble. He shows Kelly the wild side of Rome. She loves it, but it doesn't love her. Soon she is slacking off, skipping assignments, and getting in trouble with the authorities. Can Kelly get a grip on herself, and remember why she came to Rome, or will she mess up again and get booted out of the program?"
4,Wicked cool!,"I enjoyed this book because I learned a lot about Italy by reading it. Kelly spends all summer in Italy, touring Rome, Florence, the Vatican, and other smaller towns. She learns about Italy's culture, food, art, and history by sightseeing, talking with locals, and painting. However, the characterization in this book is a little cheesy and stereotypical. Think typical high-school characters: there is a cheerleader, a gothic girl, and a crazy vegan/' activist. Still, I enjoyed reading about Kelly's adventures. This book changed my life and it was wicked cool! Read it or die!!"
1,HRT - SYNTHETIC OR NATURAL IS NOT SAFE OR NECESSARY!,"I had alot to say about this book and Suzanne Sommers's belief system about menopause but Jonathan Raymond, Washington D.C. March 16, 2004 beat me to the punch. He said it all most beautifully and accurately. All I will add is that I and the women in my family have opted for natural alternatives such as diet, exercise, vitamins, herbs, good skin care and a very positive attitude. We are all healthier and happier than before the change and are not falling apart or shriveling up. Please do not buy into the belief that menopause must be treated as if it were a disease - it is not. It is just another life phase. HRT is not safe whether it be synthetic or natural.I recommend that you instead read ""No Hormones No Fear"" by Trisha Posner."
3,It changed my life,"I tried to follow the advice of this book and ended up in the hospital for a week with near fatal blood clots. The blood clots were not hereditary; they were due to an increase in Estrogen according to my blood tests. While I believe that for a number of woman this book is right on track, it does not do nearly a good enough job of warning women about potentially life ending or life threatening side effects. If you follow the advice of this book, you should research the downside and monitor your health constantly. In my case, my calves hurt (and not much); fortunately, my traditional doctor caught that this was a sign of blood clots whereas my new doctor didn't."
2,Sexy Years for Who?,"Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like "" no wonder men leave us for younger woman"". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy. Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Judy"
3,Valid Effort,I hate it when some reviewers say just get a better attitude to deal with perimenopause or menopause. Or there are other medications to use and then not mention them (maybe because they also get negative reviews). You can't assume that other women can just function normally when they go through these hormonal changes. You certainly can't be a man and have a judgemental attitude about it and make any sense. It's not you and we need acceptance for others to try these alternatives. Some cannot function properly when these changes come about but society doesn't allow it to be called a disability. But it is when it interferes in the way you function. Who cares if your taking a risk if you have to so you can function? Everything is a risk. Suzanne made a valid effort with this book and people without conceit appreciate it.
5,"No Horses, No Beans","Fido's review below is right on! We don't want horse derived hormones and we don't want those from the soybean either. I think Suzanne's solution is a good one, that she's taken the time to get her advice from some top doctors and, she is one sexy mature woman. What's she's got, I want."
4,"She's not a doctor, but brings the best to you.","Don't hold it against Suzanne that she's a celebrity, not a doctor. She has rounded up the best west coast doctors and interviewed them so you can find out the truth about bioidentical hormones. She recommends using a compounding pharmacist, and that's the best idea, but on pages 79 and 80, Dr. Schwartzbein tells how to get standard products from your regular pharmacy to get good results. Learn the difference between the junky, scary hormones in the news and the good ones that can help you."
1,Did not receive the book,I did not receive the book. I emailed the bookstore to let them know but they did not reply.
1,horgnome conection,This was not very helpful for me.Maybe it is because I am pushin 70.But I have found that Cinnamon does the trick.Just eat it on every other meal.Francis
4,DON'T MISS READING IT!,"EVERY WOMAN OVER 40 SHOULD READ IT, BOTH FOR HER SAKE AND THAT OF HER HUSBAND OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER. CONFIRM WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW BUT HAVE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT SERIOUSLY. THE BOOK IS VERY THOROUGH, FACTUAL, CONVINCING, ENABLING US WOMEN TO MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION."
3,Risk of taking hormones as a breast cancer survivor,"Although I love the concept of taking bioidentical hormones for the promise of postmenopausal health and vitality, I am very concerned about the signal Suzanne sends to breast cancer survivors and those at high risk for the disease. I think Suzanne may be sending a dangerous signal by leading people to believe that hormones are safe as long as they are natural. I don't think there is any confirmation of that for those at high risk or for those who have had breast or ovarian cancer. As for myself, I have the BRCA gene and am at very high risk. (...) IT IS VERY SEDUCTIVE TO THINK BIOIDENTICAL HORMONES ARE SAFE ELIXERS. I STILL FEAR THERE IS RISK. AND WHERE ARE THE STUDIES THAT COMPARE CONVENTIONAL HRT WITH BIOIDENTICAL HRT?"
2,"Some value, but don't blindly follow it's recommendations","An interesting insight into the mind of a menopausal woman, but Sommers's ""one size fits all"" approach to hormone therapy can be dangerous. Estrogen is estrogen, whether from a wild yam or a chemical. One is natural, but it still can cause blood clots and other dangerous side effects. Find an understanding and progressive endocrinologist and work out your therapy together. Does Prozac work for every person who feels a bit sad? Well, same with these ""miracle"" hormones."
2,not the best advice,"While Ms. Somers should be commended for trying to offer women advice regarding their health, the information in this book is sorely lacking some VERY important information.First of all, any woman with breast cancer who chooses to use estrogen should not be writing a book about women's wellbeing.Secondly, the ""cutting edge"" doctors of today do no use the estridiol hormone alone any longer, they use another estrogen which is breast protective.There are many other tests, aside from hormone levels, which need to be done and supplements that ""cutting edge"" and mainstream doctors are suggesting to prevent estrogen from causing estrogen related cancers.You just don't take hormones so you can feel ""sexy"" and young and I just think this book missed the mark."
2,GOOD IDEAS BUT NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION,This book is more about her life than what I wanted to hear. Not enough information about the natural hormones she is raving about.I was disappointed.
5,Love,By far the best book Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!
1,"Clarification of ""Spiral Bound""","This book is described as ""spiral bound"" ... to be more exact, it's a ""spiral bound notebook with lined writing paper pages and a few funny pictures"". Perhaps it's to be used as a diary? I really don't know why it's full of lined paper. There are only 9 photos with witty captions which appear over and over and over throughout the book. Whereas the photos/captions are very funny, they are hard to see/read because they're not color photos, not even black and white photos - they're pale blue/green and white photos, the same color as the lines on the pages. I really didn't expect, or need, a ""notebook"". This one's going back."
3,not for novices,"I have been very frustrated in making a quilt from this book. You have to flip between several different chapters to make the blocks, and too many steps are taken for granted. I have made several quilts from other books which were much easier to piece together, although they were rated as intermediate or difficult. The other reviews must be written by people who have been quilting for so many years that they know without being told what to do. The ideas for quilts are great- just find a different book to get the instructions from."
1,This is not The Sweet!,"These are not the classic cuts by the Glam Rock band The Sweet. This is a rip-off band, seemingly formed by Brian Connelly after he left the original band. The production qualities are poor, and this simply is not what you're looking for if you are a fan of the original Sweet."
2,Disappointed with Clifford,"I bought this for my four year old daughter and I am quite disappointed. Although the story that goes on around the games is engaging, the actual interface is clumsy and complicated. For example in one matching game you must first click on one item. Then you click on the item that matches and then you go back to the original and click again. In another game, where the dog is supposed to hit the ball with his nose, I just could not make it happen. THe dog would not connect with the ball no matter what I did. We tried it with a mouse and with the touch pad. If I can't manage it there is no way a four year old who is just learning to manipulate a computer is going to manage. We had it on easy mode. If this is meant for the ""four to six"" age range, as the package says, then they need to do some more work to make it simpler to manage."
1,Will not run for parental controlled used on Mac OS X 10.6.5,This software will not run when installed on a Mac with OS X 10.6.5 and for user under parental control. Rating of a one is too high.
5,Fantastic game!,"I'm a Special Education teacher for preschoolers, and this is one of the most useful and popular toys that I have! It has the social skills of turn-taking, cognitive such as color identification, counting, and comparing more/less, fine motor as they squeeze the scooper, and really, it's just darn good fun! I use it as a motivator, a fun reward after other learning activities, and children respond very well to this. I would recommend this game for the parents of all young children!"
2,OVER PRICED<UNDER POWERED,"will not hold bose souround spkrs, will not mount for key hole speakers, also i paid $11.99 for these on amazon, the saw them in wal-mart for $7.78 good for a cheap system, but if your speakers weigh more than 5 lbs. step up"
5,Comforting,I really liked this book. It really helped answer some questions surrounding a loved one choice to commit suicide. I would recommend this book for any survivor of suicide.
5,ultimate sadness,"I read a number of books and articles after my brother took his life a year ago. Though it is impossible to rationalize such a choice, Dying to Be Free came the closest to helping me understand the pain he was feeling at the time of his death and for many months before. It is an honest and direct look at suicide and I highly recommend it to all survivors."
3,OK,Very quick read. Although I did not find it overly informative. It does outline the greiving process but I didn't feel like it helped me know how to deal with the feelings associated with grieving. I'm sure there are better books available.
4,A need to knoow book,"This would be a good book for those that do not have any indication that there might be a family member or friend who is near committing suicide and a very good book for those who have had someone close to them do suicide. ""Dying to be Free"" is very informative and easy to read book. It will be a help to all.RICHARD"
2,Just O.K.,"This was a good basic book. My problem with it is the large amount (nearly last 1/3) of the book that talked about warning signs. To be honest, dealing with the suicide of my father, I found so much on ""warning signs"" a slap in the face. Sure, I see them now, but I wouldn't have bought a book that is supposed to help me heal when so much made me feel like ""Why didn't I see this coming?"" The first two-thirds and last chapter were fine though and I found myself making a lot of notes in the margins and highlighting. If you're like me though you'll end up skipping the last 30% of the book and it's a short book already."
4,Speed is the key,"This is hands down the fastest MacLean i've ever read, and i've readquite a few. There's no slackening of the pace anywhere - it's relentless.You just keep turning the pages, and before you know, you've run outof pages to turn !!The plot is fairly unpredictable, just full of twists and turns thatkeep one guessing, which is half the fun in such books. To begin with,the chief protagonist is on the run, having escaped from the law, andtakes a young woman as hostage. All that, however changes pretty soon,as each succeeding set of circumstances is rapidly replaced with anew scenario, building up to an interesting climax.All in all, ideal for a real quick read, eg in a journey or over a weekend."
3,An exciting thriller,"In May 1958, Talbot, owner of ""Trans Carib Air Charter Co"" was grounded at Belize in British Honduras. He was in radio contact with one of his DCs on its way to Tampa when he heard that his plane was being attacked by a US Army Air Force plane. This resulted in the death of Talbot's son, wife Elizabeth and brother Peter.Who could have wanted to destroy the plane? Who could have known that it carried more than ten billion dollars worth of gold species, emeralds and uncut diamonds? For Talbot, a long and dangerous quest for the answers to his questions is about to begin. - A very good adventure story very much in the author's vein."
5,Lally is Vyland's son,Very well written thriller by Maclean. There is one fatal flaw in the story though: A multimillionaire whose personal wealth amounts to 250 million dollars is blackmailed by a gangster who holds his family for ransom. The gangster wants to force the millionaire to allow him to use his oil rig in order to salvage a treasure worth 10 million dollars. THis doesn't make sense. Couldn't the gangster have asked the millionaire to hand him 10 million in cash for the return of his family rather than go through the tortuously silly plan of salvaging the sunken treasure?But it was a fun read regardless.
5,Don't quit,"When reading this book pay particular attention to the opening chapter. I don't think I did and when I finished I went back and reread that chapter, and the book was more meaningful. Sure, there is much improbable in the book, but I found when I finished the book it was a satisfying and worthwhile story. I have only read five of Maclean's books, to wit:2231 H.M.S. Ulysses, by Alistair MacLean (read 8 Sep 1989)2380 Where Eagles Dare, by Alistair MacLean (read 3 May 1991)2775 The Guns of Navarone, by Alistair MacLean (read 14 Aug 1995)3298 When Eight Bells Toll, by Alistair MacLean (read 14 Mar 2000)4258 Fear Is the Key, by Alistair MacLean (read 14 Jan 2007)and this book ranks with Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone--two I have good memories of."
2,A lesser work by MacLean,"At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance. ""Fear"", a story of revenge, misses the mark. I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying. Other MacLean books such as ""Dusty Death"" and ""Caravan"" better display his true abilities."
2,Don't get this flavor!,"The nutrition facts are great, just protein..no carbs no fat. I absolutely loved the graham-cracker flavor. And decided to risk it and try the strawberry kiwi. Bad move. This stuff is tough to mix. And you shake it for a second and it foams up like crazy and you have to wait like 10 minutes for the foam to go down, then when u get to actually drink it the flavor is really tart. I have tried so many proteins and am not usually a critic but had to warn people against this flavor."
3,It is what it is.,"It is whey protein powder, chocolate flavor. hard to mix unless you use a blender, and has a nasty after taste. But then again what protein powder doesn't ?"
4,Real customer,Builds muscle fast works great and taste good. Use with fat free milk for better results. I love to drink mines right before bed.
3,High Quality Protein,"Can't beat the quality of protein in this product. Great low carb protein mix to use post-workout and right when you get up in the morning. Not the greatest flavor. The chocolate flavor is VERY sweet and can be overwhelming at times. There are definitely better tasting products out in the market, but none at this quality or price."
1,Sickeningly sweet,"This product, and others by VPX, have so much artificial sweetener in it that it tastes disgusting. I tried cutting it with coco power and coffee to add some bitterness to try and reduce the overwhelming sweetness, and it was still way too sweet. Is it a protein powder or a candy replacement product? Tastes like pure sugar and I feel sick after drinking it. After a week I can't stand it anymore, it's going in the trash.On the label it states no aspartame or acesulfame K, that's great. But instead they use Sucralose which is another artificial sweetener that has safety concerns."
4,Beautiful watch with not-so-great band,"This watch is really beautiful, but the clasp is bracelet style and pretty poor quality. It would never stay clasped, and the metal piece constantly dug into my wrist and left red marks. I bought a traditional style watch band and replaced the bracelet band, and I like it much better. It would be nice if they mentioned the style of the band, or used a higher quality band, but the actual timepiece is nice looking and seems to be good quality."
3,Comes in below expectations,"I'd say 2.5 stars instead of 3. This CD is okay. That's about it though. The best cd's in my opinion are the ones that you don't ""get"" right away. The ones you have to continually listen to. The ones that still sound fresh after years. The ones that twist your mind so to speak.I ""got"" this cd immediately. Not that it is awful music, but it is not music that will have any kind of impact on me or will challenge me as a listener. It's formulaic without any surprises. I had expected more because I believe Creed is capable of doing better, of taking more time to expand their music.If you are looking for brilliant music, get Tool's CD Lateralus. After experiencing ""Lateralus"", you will see what I mean. I guess it is not fair to compare any band to Tool but it is impossible not to use Tool as a frame of reference for how much of an impact music can truly have."
2,ugh,This is some of the most pretentiously derivative crud I've ever made the mistake of exposing my ears to. Just because it's not the Backstreet Boys or Slipknot doesn't mean it's good music.This CD is just downright BAD.Don't get it. Please. For the sake of rock. For your brain cells. For the future of personkind.Don't listen to Creed
1,Sellout,"I bought My Own Prison in January of 1998 before anyone had heard of them. They rocked - they weren't afraid to play hard music. Now it seems all they want to do is please MTV and pop radio. Bullets is one of the only songs that shows they can still play hard, old style Creed. Maybe someday they'll realize they should play the music they started with instead of what MTV wants them to play"
3,Lacking in substance,"I can't believe the way people are throwing out 5-star ratings like they are completely meaningless. Just because you ""like"" the CD after one listen does not warrant a 5-star rating. This is a somewhat solid album, yes, but nothing to drool over. Creed is one of my more favored bands...I own all of their albums, and I've seen them live. But this album brings absolutely nothing new to the table.Many of the slower songs sound exactly like Human Clay. The harder songs rock with too much speed and too little musicality to truly fit the album. They've written their first epic piece in ""Who's Got My Back."" It clocks in at 8 1/2 minutes with some of it taking the form of a Cherokee chant. This song really is an interesting addition, but really doesn't hold enough power to pull this album from what it really is. ""My Sacrifice"" is all over the radio, but I think Creed will have a hard time backing this song up. There is little substance to this album. Lacking. I'm disappointed."
2,Poor follow up to two excellent albums,"I was not impressed at all with this new release. In my opinion, Human Clay is Creed's best work by far and I was expecting this album to at least equal or better Human Clay. Unfortunately, this album is a disappointment. The songwriting is very generic and not very creative and Mark Tremonti's guitar playing is very boring. Nothing creative like on Human Clay and My Own Prison. It seems like the band ran out of good ideas and just threw something together just to put an album out which is what I feared would happen from a band which has set the bar so high for itself."
1,You can thank creed...,"...for inspiring people to give up on listening to the radio. Because of Creed, someone just stomped his radio to splinters and decided to seek out some decent music. He'll be a better person for it. I read an interview with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age where he said something along the lines of ""If you like heavy music and hate Creed, you need somewhere to go,"" referring to his band. I sort of feel sorry for Creed. They're the perfect scapegoat for what is wrong with music today and take more verbal abuse than any other band, and now they are taking it from one more person. At least they can console themselves with the fact that they are one of the biggest-selling acts in music right now. Don't know how long that will last, though."
2,Snore....,"I thought the last Creed disc had some interesting material but this one just bores me-REALLY bores me. The first time I heard this disc at a bookstore I could actually guess the direction of the coming chord progressions. So nothing really surprised me, and while I liked a couple of songs, it is very clear that Creed has a formula that they use every time. That formula is showing diminishing returns here. Not worth the $."
4,Good Album,"First, i'm not a fan of melody kind of stuff, but i have given 4 stars, mainly for the lyrics. It's amazing and i should give full credit not only to Scott for his part of play, but to Tremonti, who's been doing an excellent job since My Own Prison.In a way i was bit dissappointed with the slow kind of music included here, but Bullets, Freedom Fighter and Who's Got My Back fills the gap.comparing with the previous albums, this stays far behind the first and the second. i took this album as an indication of melting the pace and reputation which creed had over the years, which is visible with the crappy, melody tunes included here.In that way, it's good that Creed split up, saving their reputation without harming the great memories we have of their music.. if not , they would have ended up their way where most of the rock/metal bands ended up,... singing melodies.overall, this is good album(despite the lullby's), something you can keep on listening."
4,"Solid, but not there best effort.","Out of Creeds three albums this is the weakest, but still overall a solid album. I believe they were missing a good bass player. Mark's guitar parts were good but I felt they weren't as talented as the other albums. I hope they improve from this one, on there next effort."
1,A hate crime on my ears!,"In these troubling times one must wonder if the continual success of this band does or does not indicate some sort of epicdegredation in American culture. This music is beyond bad, it actually chokes the U.S. with it's own shallow blandness and mediocrity. It is said that art can strengthen and enrich a culture, but this might be a sort of anti-art that does the opposite, much like waht Journey did in the late 70's."
1,Some cheese with your whine?,"I remember first hearing ""My Own Prison"" 4 or so years ago. My jaw dropped as I realized it wasn't Pearl Jam. Last week I went to my friend's bachelor party and watched an alpha-male jock get a lapdance to Scott Stapp bleating ""My Sacrifice"". This style of lukewarm grunge is as dated-sounding as hair-metal was in the early 90's. Actually, it's worse because even Winger had decent guitar solos. That makes Creed, and its army of sound-alikes (Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Incubus, Default, etc., etc., etc.) possibly the most boring and unimaginative music made since the first animal-skin was ever stretched on a log to create the world's first instrument. Tacky cover art, too."
2,all aboard the grunge train...oops we missed it.,"who's sacrafice? i think it was mine, by virtue of spending fifteen dollars and one hour of my life, in a feeble attempt to grow respect for this band. unfortuantely, it was a waste of time for both them and i. as a fair music critic, i can safely say, a music aficionado would be better off purchasing either a Pearl Jam cd or Dan Defeo's Greatest Hits, both of which prominantly dispaly musical mastery and extensive vocal capabilities. I would rather hear Vedders 'Better Man' or DeFeo's 'I Wanna Die' anyday. Those are classics, which 'My Sacrafice' will never measure up to. but that is just my opinion."
1,A hideous trend in contemporary music continues...,"Creed are the ultimate statement on the watering down of the ""grunge"" aesthetic that swept the world roughly 10 years back. Nirvana actually had some ""cred"" and were a breath of fresh air for those in the mainstream (and perhaps a different matter for those in the independent scene), but then came Pearl Jam...then Bush... then Live... then along comes Creed. And to make matters worse, now there's a whole slew of ""post-Creed"" bands like Nickelback and Default. Someone get me a gun!An intelligent fellow remarked that Creed are today's answer to '70s Journey. Whilst you're at it, you might as well add in the likes of Foreigner, Boston, Kansas and all that other turgid pap that ruled the airwaves back in the day. Creed and their ilk are safe, cliched, formulaic, humourless drivel that sap the life out of music as we know it. If you seriously think this is what rock'n'roll is all about, then you just ain't looking hard enough."
1,They've finally made it...,"Creed's new single, ""Don't Stop Dancing,"" echoes the similar cheesy ballad message of ""When the Children Cry"" from the 80's. Creed has officially become the White Lion of the 2000's."
2,Pretentious Piece of Yuck,"Gawd, this album is terrible.To say much else would be to put more work into it than the band did, but the words lackluster, bloated, and, um, oh yeah, terrible, spring to mind.I'm giving it two stars instead of one because although I played it once all the way through I couldn't hack the painful monotony and fled to an adjoining room, and it's possible that some good bit didn't make it through the wall. Yeah. Right."
4,Good Stuff,"I have heard the previous two albums from Creed, and to top them is hard. This album tries to do that but fails even though it has it's moments. It would be in par with ""My own prison"" in terms of sound rather than ""human clay"". It is an album which would satisfy anybody's daily rock dosage. I would rate ""Human clay"" as the best, followed by ""Weathered"" and ""My own Prison"" sharing second best."
4,No surprises but not a let down....,"This album is a mix of the first two. The first album was on the heavy side, the second more subtle and this is a good combination. The lyrics are meaningful which is a refreshing change from many current doom and gloom themes out there. Creed has kept the same basic formula but it seems to work for them. I would like to hear a little more melody and also the lack of backing vocals or harmonies gives them less depth. So this is not an album that amazed me, but I will enjoy listening to it a lot - Basically, if you are ALREADY a Creed fan, you will NOT be disappointed!"
5,Muy Bueno.,"Better than Human Clay. Who's Got My Back kinda puts you into a coma before it gets going, but once it does, it rocks. Bullets gives an adrenaline rush opening and keeps it throughout the whole song. Freedom Fighter is good, Stand Here With Me and Weathered are excellent, and obviously My Sacrifice and One Last Breath are great,otherwise the radio wouldnt be so OCD about them. This CD never leaves my discman, it's just that good."
4,Creed...a power trio!,"I would like to say to the first 12 year old reviewer on this page...AC/DC? They don't sound the same? Sit down youngster! I have been a Creed fan since the first time I heard My Own Prison and they have literally grown into a powerhouse! I was a little worried when they lost Brian Marshall, because I didn't want that messing up their chemistry, but it didn't! The first two tracks, Bullets and Freedom Fighter, absolutley rock! There is not another modern rock band out right now laying tracks down that heavy! They could make an entire album that heavy and aggresive and I would be happy! I would like to see Creed go more into a heavy/technical direction for the future, and not just plateau with tracks like Higher and My Sacrifice. If you know the bands history they list some very heavy influences, so I believe they have the potential to experiment and to put out great songs for years to come."
3,"overrated, but okay album","Why is everyone going crazy about this new album of Creed? I don't know. I was about to give this 2 stars, but realizing that they were Creed, decided to make it three. Compare this to the five stars I gave My Own Prison. This is much too radio- friendly. I must've heard ""my sacrifice"" a thousand times within a week of the release. Its a good song, but not that good. Anyway, the standout tracks are ""bullets"", ""one last breath"", and the title track."
5,"Very, Very Good Rock & Roll","Creed's third album is a hard rocking expierence. The 11 songs on here are loud, emotional, and thought-provoking. ""My Sacrifice"" is defintely the high-light with ""One Last Breath"" and ""Weathered"" backing it up. Buy this CD now! You won't regret it."
4,a good album that continues in the vain of human clay,"This is not creeds best album but it's not there worst.from aliyiclal stand point it's not that good, but from a musial standpoint it's great. marks guitar tone is more higher than human clay. but weathered has songs in it for every body. structuredfrom hard to medeocre to soft. but it's not as bad as peoplewould like to make you think it is. but really anything creeddoes will always be slagged off by the majority no matter whatthey do."
3,Sounds like Creed!,"Well, if you absolutely loved Human Clay, then just skip my review and go buy the CD, becuase it sounds pretty much the same. Same Scott Stapp screaming borderline Christian songs with monumental guitars thundering and drums beating away. Highlights include My Sacrifice, Dont Stop Dancing, Freedom Fighter and One Last Breath. I might like Signs a little better if I could understand the Indian chanting, and Who's got my Back is kind of annoying. This band seems to believe that they are the center of the universe, and their songs reflect that. All their songs are about ""the big picture"" and that is OK, but they go on overkill mode sometimes. Overall, lots of soft intro riffs, followed by Stapps mediocre voice singing about mortality and the such. Good for a few listens, but not a keeper."
3,Big OK,"i just got it and its pretty good but not awesome ( like my own prison.) its more in the vein of human caly, but with really weird chanting or talking at the beginning of the songs, which is really annoying. but other than that its pretty good, with some really good songs (bullets and my sacrifice) so i would recommend buying it if you really like creed but if you dont stay away."
2,heard this before,"well, if you own human clay, you have already heard this cd. it just has different lyrics. thats about it. so it boils down to this: if you like creeds post-grunge-pearl-jam-wanna-be-rock, buy it. if you dont like creed, dont buy it, this cd wont change your mind. i thinks its okay. nowhere near alien ant farm, lifehouse, incubus, or system of a down, but ok."
1,"A WOEFUL, lame, Christian version of P.J.","Pearl Jam - Talent + Pat Robertson's 700 Club + VH1 - Behind the Music and Legends + Joey Lawrence + Michael Bolton + bushel-loads of hype + Grand Funk Railroad - Talent = Creed...Buy the real thing. Buy Pearl Jam. Or NIN, or the late, great, Soundgarden, or KMFDM, or Ministry, or Tool... Hell, even Bush, even System of a Down or Limp Bizkit is better than this. I'll relish the day when, after the 15 minutes have long-expired, Scott Stapp (or whatever his crummy name is), will pump gas into my car whenever I'm in the vicinity of the trailer park he'll be living in."
1,This music makes me want to rip my face off,"I never have been terribly fond of Creed....their first two albums were mediocre and ""With Arms Wide Open"" and its ensuing video were absolutely obnoxious. However, this is the last straw. How ""spiritual"" dreck like this is popular, I'll never know. Most likely, it's because the public needs someone to be Pearl Jam, and Pearl Jam decided they didn't want to do that a long time ago. Actually, Weathered doesn't sound as much like Pearl Jam....it sounds more like Tool. Really, really bad Tool. Funny, before this CD I had no idea what really bad Tool could sound like.....better luck next time Stapp. Or not."
1,Creed is brain-washing our youth,"Creed is not about God, love, respect or anything that most christians might believe their music is about. Creed is trying to brain-wash everyone with their particular brand of annoying music. The song ""My Sacrifice"" makes references to Creed being the second coming of Jesus Christ. The lyrics are riddled with satanistic ideology. DO NOT buy this CD. You will never be the same."
3,Why do I dislike this band?,"The guitarist is more than competant, the guy's voice is quite strong and pretty. Maybe it's because their music is derivative? Nah, I won't hold that against them as everyone is influenced by what they've heard to an unavoidable extent. It's probably because they are as fake and plasticky as their computer-generated album covers and videos. ""One Last Breath"" is a good example. The singing seems to stem from emotion, but for what? Six feet down really ISN'T that deep. This song makes no sense and reeks pretention.Nice power chord vibes on the album, but ultimately they're hollow and occasionally pretentious. Maybe they'll get better after Scott Stapp figures out exactly what he believes finds something worthwhile to sing about."
5,BEST CREED CD YET,"I first started liking Creed when they came out with Human Clay. I had no idea their 3rd album would be this good. Every single song is great. If I had to pick a favorite, it would have to be ""Freedom Fighter"", but all of the songs rock. I personally recommend this CD to any rock fan. You won't regret it..."
3,OK.,"Creed's latest release, ""Weathered"" is not really all that great, but it's not too bad either. Songs like ""My Sacrifice"", ""One Last Breath"", and ""Who's got my Back?"" are the best ones on here. ""Lullaby"", ""Freedom Fighter"", and ""Signs"" are the worst. Not exactly worth buying."
3,"Some killer, some filler","I have no doubt that Scott Stapp and the rest of Creed have had their share of difficulties in life, but breaking out of the mold they have cast must be high on their list.Surprisingly, they seem to do it for the first half of the record. Several ""nu metal"" songs, in the ""A Perfect Circle""-esque 6/8 time signature, and a fair amount of experimentation. Lullabye is also interesting--leaving out the weakest member of the band (Scott Phillips).But the rest of the album is filler. Even with lyrics supposing to be spiritual and deep, they come off pretentious, and the sound is direclty off of ""Human Clay.""Ultimately, this album shows that Creed have the possibility of breaking the mold, but it will take an album or two to complete what seems to be a crack--albeit sizable--on this one."
1,AIRHEADS,"Okay, I've finally figured out where these guys came from. But for the life of me, I can't figure out which one is Adam Sandler."
2,very disappointing,"there is not much to say, except that i expected so much more from what i got on this album. i brought it after hearing ""my sacrifice"", but unfortunately this ended up to be the only song worth listening to on the album. i really enjoyed ""human clay"", creed's previous offering, but i think they are moving in a dangerous direction with ""weathered"". all the songs sound alike: like the band is trying too hard to prove something, and that they are stronger than whatever it is that they have gone through. gone is the earnest tone from ""arms wide open"", replaced by an in your face, here i am like it or not 'tude from scott stapp. this is just my opinion, but creed doesn't wear this suit well."
2,"Same ol, Same ol","This isn't a bad album. ""My Own Prison"" and ""Human Clay"" were different albums in their own right, exploring different areas of music and showing Creed's development as a band. ""Weathered"" might as well have been called ""Human Clay II"", except not nearly as good. I'm not sure what they were trying to do, or if some record executive weasel had some input into the album. But this album just doesn't get it right.Oh yeah and LAY OFF THE RELIGION! You say you aren't pushing religion on anyone or a christian band, so drop it already. Or is there money to be made there..."
5,Creed Is 4 Real! A+++++++,"Well contrary to all the hate mongors wishes, this cd rocks in the best way possible.Creed ""puts up"" with Weathered release, now the rest should ""shut up"".I absolutely love the intensity of this cd, it won't disappoint."
2,Very disappointing!,"This album is weak! Usually you find a couple of great songs on an album, and the rest are just ok. This album is no different, except it is missing the couple of really great songs. If you want to listen to a whole album of B-sides by Creed, this is the one for you!"
5,GREAT MUSIC--Their BEST CD,"Other people write that this CD is crappy, and sounds like a knock-off of Pearl Jam. I'll tell you what it sounds like, it sounds like CREED. This CD was great. After Creed started out soft, they went on to hard rock to get their fans jumpin. GREAT MUSIC. GREAT GROUP. GREAT CD!!!"
1,Creed is horrible,"Creed have become the poster boys for hard rock. Too bad, it's nothing but bland, soft, wimpy, whiny, generic rock. No, Weathered is not a musical masterpiece and no, Creed didn't go downhill on this release. They stayed exactly where they were. The only difference is now they have no bass player. That is horribly retarted. ""Bullets"" is not heavy. It's dumb. Scott Stapp is not capable of making heavy vocals. He is capable of making whiny,... hick-like vocals and wearing gay tight leather pants and making dumb hand motions on the videos...The only song they've ever made that is even SOMEWHAT tolerable is ""My Own Prison"". This is just as dumb as all that nu-metal garbage."
1,Where's the 0 star option?,"Wow...I can't believe I'm wastin my time on reviewing a Creed album. I'll cut this short. They had nothing to say, they had nothing new to bring to the music world and that's exactly why they didn't have any reason to exist as a band. I bless the day they FINALLY broke up...too bad that stupid singer is going to go solo...they won't stop annoy me with this pre-chewed, seen-a-thousand-billion-times-before, made-for-radio type of music."
1,Jesus Hates Creed,"I recently saw a VH1 special on the struggles of Creed. Now, I'm sure the guys in Creed are all very nice--and I'm sure they 've all faced tough times in life like the rest of us--but that is no reason for anyone to listen to their horrible music. Creed is every cliche in the rock star manual pushed to the point of absurdity. This band makes me cry for the state of contemporary music. It is worse than if Nirvana or Pearl Jam had never existed. All the vitality of early 90s hard rock has been gutted, repackaged with some creepy ""spiritual' message (i.e., not punk rebellion but messianic posturing), and sold as authentic rock to a public whose taste has been gradually poisoned by boy bands and Lolita knock-offs."
1,"HAHA, NOW THATS FUNNY!","You want to know whats funny? BOTH CREED AND PEARL JAM SUCK! That being said ON TO MY CREED REVIEW!!I despise creed, it sounds to christian rock to me, granted the lead singer can do a decent job i'm sorry but I can't rally behind this band, don't buy it, buy Dead Kennedy's stuff"
1,Creed Gets Wussified,"Say what you will about baritone signer Scott Stapp's religious views or his overzealous attitude, Creed's first two records rocked(Yes, even ""With Arms Wide Open."")This record though takes their arena rock ambitions way too far. ""Bullets"" is one of the heaviest songs they've ever done, but that's all you get. ""Don't Stop Dancing"" and ""One Last Breath"" sound so corny that you think it's the 80's all over again. Wicked guitarist Mark Tremonti tries his best to rescue things with the cool Zeppelin-esque riffs of ""My Sacrifice"" and the title track, but he can't do it alone. The anger and agression of previous records is gone from Stapp's signature voice. Here he makes impassioned pleas for unity ""Stand Here With Me,"" that fall on deaf ears. This record is too slick and shows a big rock band pandering to the middle of the road."
1,Still trying to sound like Pearl Jam,"This CD is not worth the money. It is a waste of space on a disc. Every song is trash and has no chords that you can follow. It's ok if you only know 3 chords, but please put them in the right order. Mark Tremonti plays like he has his fingers stuck in between the strings. I honestly can't see how they are a Christian rock band. There is nothing Christian about them at all and Scott Stapp's God imitations don't help. Whoever coined them as ""The NEW LED ZEPPELIN"" should be struck down by the mighty Robert Plant himself. I would avoid this CD at all costs and look elsewhere. Pearl Jam would be a good start."
1,The gayest band ever!,"Creed really SUCKS! They are the biggest Pearl Jam rip-off ever! They claim to be Christian, but they still suck.Scott Stapp has the biggest rip-off voice of Ediie Vedder of all time! Creed sucks sucks sucks! Listen to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Tad, Mother Love Bone, Mudhoney, Temple of the Dog, and Green Water for grunge and Living Sacrifice, Crimson Thorn, Zao, Extol, As I Lay Dying, and Vomitorial Corpulance for goos Christian music!"
2,Beatiful Melodies - Nasty Voice,"First of all, I don't understand how they can sell 847,000 copies in the first week, the melodies are great in this album, but HIS VOICE is so nasty!, he sounds like he's mumbling. But, pop music is pop music and they are extremely overplayed and I really don't think that the lead singer has any talent, but the band is better...maybe they need to get the band players to sing. But, I give it 2 stars because they deserve some sort of recognition, but this album is just being over-played. This album will be going to the used CD store. Sorry, guys, maybe their next album will be better."
1,Transimition of pop,"No!!!!!!!!Not another Nu-metal dummies acting as a great musicnans and fantastic composers.after releasing ""Human Clay"" (a great post-grunge album) they made some little nightmare with songs simmilar one after another..."
1,Generic rock,"Creed is just another overhyped generic ""new"" rock band thier songs are all the same and lack rock n roll attitude , Heck they have the attitude of , well , Hanson . Anyway if you want real rock with attitude and TALENT avoid this and get yourself some Zeppelin , AC/DC , or GNR ."
1,MUSIC?!?,"How can people fall for these idiotic fakes that can't write music that true music-lovers can actually listen to? EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME AND IS ABOUT THE SAME THING: HOW HORRIBLE MY LIFE IS. It should take a little more depth and thought to write lyrics that enlighten, not depress, the band's fans. So when I see people with their stupid little candles, thinking that this will save their lives (just like Bono will save the world :), I think to myself: Has music really gotten that bad? Do artists now sing what their fans want them to sing? If that's the case, then music has now reached an all time low point. And this album doesn't help much."
2,Come on...Really Come ON!,"I think the more melodic songs like one last breath are good, in the other case i really despise the horrible harder songs like Bullets and Freedom Fighter which i can barely listen to due to Mark Tremonti's so called headbanging music. I thought this was a very terrible effort put forth by this musician i thought had talent now he just disgusts me. Everything else on the album was ""decent."" I would think Creed would put forth a better effort than this. It sounds like they banged this album out in about a month. Very very dissapointing. Try some other good bands and musicians such as Stevie Ray Vaughan or Nirvana. This is my opinion choose what fits your fancy. I suggest you dont buy this because its just another corporate machine."
3,CREED IS OVER...,Mark Tremonti and Scott Phillips kicked Scott Stapp's ass out of the band. That equals no more Creed. I like their first 2 cd's this one was ok....My own prison is great...this one could use a little work. They are a rock band...i hate how they geared some songs to the women and the radio. Thats why you have gay bands like nsync and backdoor boys
2,uh.................,"I bought this album about a year ago, and i sadly admit that i liked it at first. But now that I have expanded my cd collection by a large quantity, this cd just seems lame. Bullets is the only half decent track on the cd, and the lyrics are just bad on it also. The rest are just the same musical structure, same lyrics, over and over again. My Own Prison was a great album, some of the stuff on human clay was decent (definitely not arms wide open or higher though), but this cd just conveys that they have fully sold out. Also, the fact that every other rock band is copying creed's style ticks me off, they are just trying to make money and not real music. I'm not going to buy creed's next cd because this one is proof that they have sold out for good."
4,After a few more listens....,"I originally gave this cd 2 stars on first listen, but since then it has grown on me and I have to say it is pretty good. Some of the songs get better with repeated listens. ""Children Don't Stop Dancing"" is an awesome song. It's nice to hear a rock cd that features inspiring lyrics. If you hate this cd, try listening again...you may have to admit you were wrong like I did."
4,Beautiful songs,"Creed throughout this album experimented and met with success. They fused their fast paced strong deep songs like Bullets and Signs with soft almost lullaby radio friendly tunes like Don't Stop Dancing, Lullaby, Who's Got my Back?.I enjoyed this album for two of the three favourite songs were on this album, Signs and Who's Got My Back. My other is Illusion on Creed's platinum album My Own Prison. The last track is perfectly suited to end the album and as we found out later it also closed their career as a band when Scott Stapp went his own way.Each song on this album is beautiful and reveals a side to the nature of Creed that has impacted on the huge fan base and the band's critics."
2,a few good songs,"Signs and Bullets are my favs on this cd...but even so, I hardly listen to this cd. I bought it when it first came out and afer a few listens, I put it on the back shelf.If you want a good Creed CD, check out My Own Prison."
1,BAN HAND-HOLDING ROCK!!,"Please, if you love this band, ALWAYS USE HEADPHONES! Nobody else wants to hear this shlop."
2,Not so Fantastic,"I really like Creed and I heard this was a great CD, so caught up in the hype I just went out and bought it without listening to anything more than what I heard on the radio. Never again. The best of it was what I heard on the radio, and I should have just downloaded the stuff I liked and saved my money. I thought the majority of the CD had muddled sound and murky lyrics. I believe that 70% of this CD is beneath what Creed is capable of doing. They should have waited to release this until they could match the excellence of the 30% that was good."
2,Formulaic And UNBELIEVABLY Derivative,"Anyone who claims this CD is in any way ""original"", ""profound"", or even ""releasable"" should be forced to undergo psychiatric evaluation. Why? Let's take a look:1. This is an EXACT copy of Creed's previous album, Human Clay. Want proof? Listen to ""My Sacrifice"" and ""Higher"" in sequence. They're the SAME song; same hook, same bridge, same voice, same quasi-religious lyrical bent.2. They're Matchbox 20 with a harder edge.3. The lyrics are facile and certainly not ""profound""; a grade four might have written ""My Sacrifice"", for example.4. If you have ANY knowledge of music history, you'll know where their roots and influences lie, and how they blatantly ripped off all of their roots and influences (ex: The Grateful Dead).In Brief: The Creed Formula As Follows:Lyrics With Religious Undertones + Lots Of Guitar Thumping + Gravelly Voice = Human Clay, Weathered, My Own Prison."
3,Good Production and Sound,First of all Creed is an good band that features excellent performers. The thing is that today everybody sounds like them or Creed sounds like every modern rock band in the market.Creed has some good points like the excellent guitar work and impressive vocals but I find it hard to tell the difference from one album to the other. Overall I find the tracks on this CD to be well played and produced and one thing for sure is that it rocks my stereo but they lack a clear and defined personality.
4,Tight CD,"The lead singer, Scott, truly does have one of the best set of vocals in the pop field as he comfortably sings the music and it sounds nice. The instruments played on the disc are great as they greatly help the songs in their essential sounding better. There is a mix of rock here from the kinda hard rock of some of the songs to the ballads or slower songs such as the hits MY SACRIFICE and ONE LAST BREATH which are some great songs. LULLABY is another great rock ballad. Overall, a cohesive and wellworth it CD by a great band."
3,Weathered:Hmmm.............it's ok,Weathered from Creed is not so good.It didn't really like the songs.They range from being pretty good to being pretty bad.Here are my track ratings:Song: Track Rating:1.Bullets 9.5/102.Freedom Fighter 7/103.Who's got My Back 6.5/104.Signs 8/105.One Last Breath 9/106.My Sacrifice 7/107.Stand Here With Me 6.5/108.Weathered 7.5/109.Hide 9.5/1010.Don't Stop Dancing 7/1011.Lullaby 5.5/10I don't recommend buying this album.If you buy it you will SURELYregret it.
3,Promotion is everything,"I never got into Creed until Weathered was loaned to me - it was enjoyable, but not groundbeaking. Geez, this band sounds a lot like Canada's under-promoted ""The Tea Party"".The Tea Party's later stuff is only available as imports in the U.S. With the right promotion, they could have been huge.Creed is okay, you could do worse. Expand your horizons!"
4,Creed certainly is NOT under the weather,"Creed's third release Weathered is sure to follow in the steps of their previous two albums, My Own Prison and Human Clay. From the popular hit My Sacrifice, to the indian chanted introduction of Who's Got My Back the album displays Creed's many talents both musically and vocally. Any Creed fan would be crazy not to go out and purchase this excellent new release. I highly recommend it as a devoted Scott Stapp fan and a general fan of music. This is one CD you won't regret buying."
4,Creed is back and better than ever!,"Creed's third album ""Weathered"" is the follow up to 10 X Platinum ""Humna Clay"" but reminds me more of ""My own prison"", with it's first single ""My Sacrafice"" Creed shows they still know how to rock. ""Bullets"" starts the album off with a hard rocker and a personl favorite with songs such as ""Signs"" and ""Who's got my back"" to softer ballads such as ""Lullaby"" and ""Don't stop dancing"" this epic album is a most have."
5,A band that is perfecting their art,"I have listened to Creed since their debut album. I was so happy to see them performing at the Thanksgving NFL Classic in Dallas this year. This halftime show was timely to what was going on in our country. Children harmonized with Scott Stapp in giving a chorus to ""Don't Stop Dancing."" Their show gave me a few peeks to songs on the new album,the third Release album. Now since I have purchased the album my expectations have been met with good melodies and good rock that I have thoroughly enjoyed on their previous albums, the album did not dissappoint me. Wish I could have said that about some of my old girlfriends, but oh well!"
3,ANOTHER ONE WITH SOME GOOD SONGS....,"WEATHERED is a good HEAVY ROCK album...Like HUMAN CLAY and MY OWN PRISON, WEATHERED show HUGE influences from SOUNDGARDEN(Freedom fighter, WEATHERED )PEARL JAM ( LAST BREATH, SACRIFICE) and STONE TEMPLE PILOTS (SIGNS)...CREED is a big mix of the GRUNGE scene...in a WAY MORE POP way...."
2,Big disappointment,"Listen to the samples and buy the 1-2 good songs. Creed had two great albums, but this one shows why some bands should break up."
3,Just not there...,"I tried to like this album I really did but it just does not have it for me. The music just doesn't move me on this album like ""My Own Prison"" nothing new or fresh. It feels the same other than ""Bullets"" which really is in your face and gets your attention. Maybe the next album will be different unfortunately with most music in mainstream you have to ride the tide and enjoy the ride while it lasts. I just hope this isn't the sign that its coming down and won't get any better. So better than some but not great."
1,0 stars if it was an option,"Typical sycophantic teeniebopper oriented emasculated corporate rock with worthless intellectually incompetent ""suck-up-to-authority"" lyrics sung in a pathetically effeminate deep throated whine by a black haired florida boy with the mind of a neolithic troglodyte. Creed has one message and one message only: ""conforming is cool!"" I can easily picture these guys ""partying down"" with your local pastor at one of your church's frequent youth group parties. Warning: listening to this valueless hogwash is bound to lower IQ scores by 60%. Please avoid at all costs. Sitting in a 1rst grade math class is more intriguing."
1,Creed,"I think Eddie Vedder and the rest of Pearl Jam sounded better before they called themselves Creed. I'll take Pearl Jam's old stuff like ""Ten"" over their new stuff any day."
1,Right............,"Yes, Creed is the weakest band to ever be on the face of the planet. They have tried thier best to sum up but they just cant do it. Scott Stapp is such a [bad] song writer. My Own Prison at least didnt aim for high school girls as fans. I mean come on.....The only thing this band has going for them is the guitarist he writes a few good riffs every once and awhile. I recommend not buying this cd if you are a real rock fan."
1,I've converted to Christianity,"After hearing the powerful words preaching corruption and impurity in the opening track Bullets, I was captivated throughout the whole album. After hearing the nonstop wall of distortion and prayer, I decided to call in a Jehova's Witness and discuss the importance of Jesus in our lives. Creed embodies all that is good in Jesus and is another tool of God to bring us out of the darkness and to Him. Creed's potent message is brought forth in the language of the common man so that he may understand His Word. Scott Stapp's vision is unlike any I've ever seen... he can redirect the lives of even the heathen souls like me to the Light. Creed is the voice of God!Yeah..."
1,don't waste your time,"trite music for the masses, 3rd generationderivatives of the early nineties grunge bandswho were themselves derivative."
2,Deja Vu?,"I loved Creed's first album. I guess they did too... so much that they re-recorded 2 more times. I'm still waiting to hear new riffs... I think several of their songs could have the lyrics switched and still work with the melodies and tempos. I'll play My Own Prison over and over, but I'm not rushing to the stores to buy any others."
1,utter toss...,"I hate creed,they're yet another commercial rock band thats polluting our music-ways.The singer sounds like hes constipated all the time,the music is predictable and boring,very radio friendly,and their film clips have the lead singer splashing around in water with his top off..dont waste your hard earn cash everyone..and even if its not hard earned,i still wouldnt buy this.....i think thats enough said.P.S .Tool are the best band in the world"
1,a sellout again,"Chris Heckmann needs to watch MTV and see how Creed HAS changed, he probably just heard Creed yesterday, bought all 3 CD's, and claims they haven't changed over the past 4 years. Do you know about the BAND themselves? Not just the type of songs?I saw them live in April 1999, and they PLAYED hard and great. They didn't care about being on MTV or on 'Scream' soundtracks, or whatever. They cared about pleasing ROCK fans. Scott Stapp must be giving in to all the teenage girls listening to Top 40."
1,This is an awful CD........,"A couple reasons why not to buy this awful CD.1. Scott Stapp, the lead singer, sounds like everyboy else out today.2. Every song on the CD sounds the same.3. They copied all the metal bands out their today.Their videos are also so lame, I don't know what the record company was taking when they signed Creed to a record deal."
5,Good Rock,"Creed's heaviest.Bullets is the best song on the cd and Freddom Fighther and Wheathered are also good too. What else can i say,its good rock so if you like good rock buy this cd."
2,wish i didn't get this (as a gift),"first off...let me say that i do not like Creed as much as i used to...i first liked Human Clay when it came out, and then i became interested in other (more talented) bands. So when i heard Creed was coming out with a CD, i was not planning on getting it. In fact, i tried to avoid it. A good friend of mine called me afew days ago and said he got me a new CD for my B-day, and i had hopes that maybe it was one i actually wanted, but then he told me he got me this CD, and i was SO disappointed. The only songs i even listen to on it are Bullets and Who's Got my Back; the others (are) pretty (bad) . And they probably don't even deserve credit for those songs, the way people are talking about them ripping off other artists (i don't listen to Pearl Jam or Led Zeppelin so i wouldn't know). I would sell it to someone at skool, but i don't want to offend my friend who bought it for me.....sorry, i'll just stick to Deftones and A Perfect Circle...."
3,Average,"This album is what I thought it would be, average. My Own Prison is their best work and I doubt we will ever hear better from Creed. Yes, I do think the band makes music to sell. I think Stapp wants to be Jim Morrison also. But, I think they are alright anyway. I bet if they were to sit around an old dirty apartment and write songs and not have an image to live up to, deadlines to meet, or the pressures of beings rock stars, I think they would be a very good band. Anyway, glad I bought the c.d., I will listen to it for a few weeks than throw it in a drawer, it isn't going to change my life, know what I mean? 25 years from now, we will be lying in bed watching late night T.V. and there will be an informercial selling a c.d. of 'Turn of the Century Greats', Creed will have a song or two on there and you will think, ""oh yeah, I remember them"". Sorry to say, they aren't going to make music history or anything. Tremonti is a great guitarist though! Thanks."
5,A new fan,"WOW! This album blew me away. I was not a Creed fan before but a friend gave me the album for my birthday yesterday. I shrugged and gave it a listen...and decided I need to upgrade my stereo system. This album RAWKS! My favorites are Bullets, Freedom Fighter, Who's Got My Back?, One Last Breath and Stand Here With Me; although I can't say there's a song on it I don't like. If this is the Creed of the two earlier albums, I'm buying them!"
3,"Still great music, but with a different sound","Being a huge creed fan, i was very critical of their 3rd album. After all, it isn't easy to improve on a ten-time platinum CD. The first time i went through the trakes i was disappointed with half of the songs. But then all of the songs began to grow on me as i listened to them more. I would definately give this album five stars, even though it isn't as good as the previous albums they have released.The first four songs took me the longest to enjoy, but as for the rest of the album, it is great. I enjoy the more laid back songs like ""one last breath"". The radio-friendly song ""my sacrifice"" is the only song like that on the cd, so don't expect all of the songs to have this same sound.This is a great cd. Afterall, this is Creed we are talking about. They have provided us with great music for several years now, and i hope will continue to do so for many years to come."
5,Creed Fills the Void,"With crunching guitars, great drum fills, and lyrics deeper than the usual radio-ready pop drivel, Creed's ""Weathered"" fills the void for those longing for some artistic hard rock. While singing of subject matter quite depressing, the melodies are uplifting simultaneously and tend to end on a positive note. It's quite amazing that such a dark band could be a positive force in the hard rock scene. Whether decrying the political correctness of modern America (""Signs"") or seeking a way out of past mistakes (""One Last Breath""), Creed rocks. This album is full of sing along anthems, especially the song dedicated to a positive role model entitled ""Stand Here with Me."" A must have!"
3,Just mediocre!,"I had real reservations about buying this album. Human Clay was all right but wasn't great. I guess that I would have to say the same about Weathered. It is not great, not bad either. I would like to add that Creed isn't as good as they like to think they are. I know my music (have been a big fan and musician for a long time) and they should cool their jets just a little. I do have to say that the best song on the album is My Sacrifice. Actually it is a very good song. Creed should be proud of it. Other than that all of the other songs are just fillers, with some fillers being better than others. Save your money unless you're a big Creed fan."
4,Just give it a try!,"If you are a creed fan who likes their two previous albums- I TOTALLY recommend this! Why haven't you gotten this already??If you haven't heard anything from them except what is on the radio, give it a try. There is a nice range of hard to soft songs on the CD- some like those that you might hear on the radio, but others that are different. And I LOVE the artwork on the cover of the CD, and inside. Put aside what you might think of creed, and give it a whirl."
1,don't buy this,"These guys are way too full of themselves. In my opinion, Creed is on the same lowley level as Limp Bizkit. Don't buy this if you're looking for spiritual music, don't buy this if you're looking for hardcore. If you want spiritual buy Bjork. If you want Hardcore, buy Zeke,The Dwarves, or MDC (I also recomend the Back From The Grave series). The only reason you'd buy this is if you're an MTV (yeech) teenybopper who wants to fit in."
1,about this,"This CD seems awfully more referential to 80s hair metal, than Pearl Jam. This guys seem to pretend they are in pain too much (as many DO), but don't make anything more of it. So what is it there to think but that they are asking to be consolated, with millions and crowds, for having something that absolutely everyone has, PAIN. The result is dull, unchallenging."
1,only God can save us from Creed,Arguably the worst band of the past 15 years. I'd rather be stuck in a locked room with Laurence Welk piped in for eternity than have to be subjected to one of Creed's songs again. The part of the 'My Sacrifice' video where Staph pulls himself out of the water into the boat has to be the most sickening and self-absorbed moment in video history. Don't compare them to Pearl Jam - it's an insult to that great and risk taking Seattle band.
5,WHAT IS THAT GUY TALKING ABOUT?,"I'VE RECENTLY READ A REVIEW BY ""A MUSIC LOVER FROM U.S"" AND HE SAID CREED SUX, HE CAN'T REALLY LOVE MUSIC AS MUCH AS HE MAKESOUT IF HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE WEATHERED BY CREED. OH IT'S TRUE, IT'S DAMN TRUE!!!!(FOR ALL WHO ARE INTO WWF!)"
3,Not nearly as good as their debut album...,"Unfortunately this cd is not even in the same league as their previous album Human Clay or the impressive debut My Own Prison. This album lacks the character and creativity of the previous works. Out of their three discs, My Own Prison still remains as my favorite one because it is both musically and lyrically satisfying. Although this cd contains a few really good tunes, it isn't enough to make this album as satisfying as its predecessors.Also, some of the lyrics seem a little corny...(ex. ""Children don't stop dancing / Believe you can fly away...away"" or ""Lets give love to all""). I don't know, maybe it's just me.It still deserves 3 stars, though. And on a more positive note, I really enjoyed the following songs: ""Bullets"", ""One Last Breath"", ""My Sacrifice"", ""Hide"" and ""Lullaby"".If you wish to listen to more great rock music with great lyrics, check out a Canadian band The Tea Party, especially the album Tangents: The Tea Party Collection (great CD)."
2,ugh.,"This was painful to listen. The album is one of the worst I have ever listened to and I have listened to some bad albums in my life. Everything about it is so bad. The lyrics are corny and cheesy, muscially it is the same thing you hear all the time. no originality, overproduced, glossy, boring, cliched and corny. The lead singers voice is annoying ( I don't think he sounds like Eddie Wedder that much. I like Pear Jam by the way). Not just that but the band members especially the lead singer is so egotistical and self-absored and indulgient that it gets so annoying by the minute. It is a shame because the other band members know how to play but they surely do not know how to write songs and the singer could easily sing differently and make something good out of his voice.I give them 2 stars because they obviously spent a lot of time in the studio making this sad exscuse for an album."
1,Creed is ...,"I'm not just given this album a bad review because I dislike Scott Stapp, it's because this cd was absolutey horrible. Sure, their 1st cd was not all that bad, and then their 2nd ""Human Clay"", wasn't either, but now it seems to me that all of their music sounds the same. After 3 albums,The only song I can listen to without me turning off the radio is one of their first big hits ""One"". If you're super religious, and like religious music, you might like this album, but you can count me out."
1,Creed is just plain boring,"Okay. When Creed first came out they were pretty good. Their CD was metal, and not lame at all. But as time went by, they became such sellouts. ""Sacrifice"" and ""Higher"" are pretty much the same tune, the same lyrics, same everything. Scott Stapp's prettyboy, looking for some love in this world, lyrics are getting so old, he might as well join a boy band. I mean, come on. You can just tell that they're sellouts by their music videos, and the cover of this album! Their music has been done before, but more uniquely. They're trying to be Led Zepplin or Pearl Jam, but not successfully. Sooner or later, you won't hear any new music from Creed since they do the same old same old.If you like Grunge, buy some early Smashing Pumpkins or Soundgarden. Not Creed."
1,What is this garbage?,"Creed has got to be the most pathetic band I've ever heard. They are imitating every popular grunge band, and not doing a very good job of it. They sound a little too much like Pearl Jam. Scott Stapp is a generic lyricist. There is absolutely no talent in this band whatsoever. I'd rather listen to Yanni than this garbage. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Not a very sucessful album,"Creed's album has not been very sucessful.Human Clay and My Own Prision have suceeded much farther.Here are my track ratings:Bullets 9.5/10 Weathered 8.5/10Freedom Fighter 8.5/10 hide 8.5/10Who's got my back 7.5/10 Don't stop dancing 8.5/10signs 8.5/10 Lullaby 8.5/10One last breath 8.5/10My sacrfice 8.5/10Stand here with me 8.5/10Creed has much better stuff,so I don't suggest you buy this album."
4,Finally! A Creed Album Where the Songs Aren't All the Same!,"I was definitely impressed with Higher and Arms Wide Open, but come on, most of the songs on Human Clay were so similar that after listening to one you'd listened to them all! I was hopeful that Creed had grown past this for Weathered and was surprised to find that they have. Weathered, while nothing phenomenal, is a good album with great heavy riffs and a variety of different styles. This shouldn't be at the top of your new music purchases, but it's definitely one to consider"
4,"""Weathered"" Creed still stands strong","I eagerly anticipated this album, and bought it the day after it came out. I hated it the first time through. It was at first so unlike Creed I wanted to puke. The first five songs have a much harder edge than any previous Creed song had. It is these songs that define a new, edgier Creed that we'll probably see again. In general, these first five are good, but none are stellar. The next five are the meat of the album; these'll be the singles. My Sacrifice is the masterpiece of Weathered, and it's followed by four more equally good tracks. Lullaby, the album's clousure, is slow, and pointless, and WILL put you to sleep. I much prefer the harder Creed, or the radio-friendly Creed. Now if only they could blend the two together..."
3,This album doesn't live up to Human Clay's standards...,"The main problem with producing a great overall album: You set your fans' expectations very high for the follow up album. Weathered is an average album. (Read: two or three hits, along with seven or eight songs that range from tripe to mediocracy.)Unless you're a die-hard Creed fan (in which case, what do you care what I think?), this album isn't worth the money. Go find your nearest friend who's a Creed fan and have them burn you copies of ""One Last Breath,"" ""My Sacrifice,"" and ""Stand Here With Me."" (""Stand Here With Me"" isn't as good as the other two, but is still worth a listen or two, no?)Stick with ""Human Clay""--a far superior album."
3,Pop-metal has never mixed well,"Poison,Warrent,Winger.....and on their way to joining that club CREED. If this is the new Joshua Tree, then we are hurting. Maybe we'll get the next ""nevermind"" from oh lets say.. Backstreet Boys. The cd does have its good moments. Like Weathered(although it is a little bit of a Bon Jovi ""wanted dead or alive"" (...)). And Hide is pretty good. Don't Stop Dancing and Lullaby made me want to puke. But really the only saving grace of this album the only reason i give it 3 stars, is Marks incredible guitar work. He is amazing."
1,Rock don't get much more dead than this,"rock is so dead. and it's been dead for quite some time... why won't it stay dead? every bad review here hit the nail on the head, especially the guy who called this anti-art. he is absolutely right that art can enrich culture and society. he/she is so right, i would love to shake your hand. creed is the pinnacle of everything that is wrong with today's music and entertainment(though i hate staind almost as much). creed tears down our culture(as do many other bands like staind, nu-metal, anything mainstream put out in the last five or six years). there is a drought of creativity. no one cares about substance, conviction, or meaning anymore. what happened to people that actually cared about the stuff they created, like RATM, kurt cobain, smashing pumpkins, and all the old great rock legends?what more can you say? thank God there's an underground music scene..."
2,"More safe, predictable music from Creed","On their first album My Own Prison, Creed's raw, unpolished sound was a great compliment to their lyrics. They were really saying something and looked like they were going on to a great music career. However, after they found out what kind of rock music sells the most copies they latched on to that sound and won't let go.On Weathered, Creed's over-produced music is combined with simplistic lyrics. For example, on Stand Here By Me Stapp sings, ""your my daily dose of reality."" It sounds like he got the line from a tv commercial. Other lyrics aren't much better and they are just too preachy on this album.So, if your looking for great music steer clear of Weathered. But if you love by the numbers music from a band that's trying their best to sound like Pearl Jam, any recent Creed, Godsmack, or Nickelback album will be perfect."
4,Thoughtful.,"I find Creed's music thoughtful. The lyrics are never ingenious or overly well-constructed, but they are thoughtful, intriguing, and most of the time inspirational. I do not feel you have to have technically perfect lyrics in order to move people.I am a bit disappointed that they geared so much of this CD toward radio airplay, but the messages in the music are still good. I also believe that they represent a movement away from the bands that feel that the only way to be artistic is to shock people more than the previous bands. As my musical tastes mature, I find that the most distasteful music is no longer the most fun to hear.All-in-all, a good offering."
5,A masterpiece,I liked Creeds first two album but their were only a few songs I really loved. But with this cd I listen to every song.This album gets you pumped up!This band is so talented.If you have taste for good musical arrangements and good lyrics buy this album
5,Impressed,"Who is this Creed? I was watching music videos one rainy weekend afternoon, a video came on that caught my eye. The song played throughout the weekend in my mind and thoughts. I purchased the CD the following Monday. Before Wednesday I memorized all the songs on the CD. I do not easily impress. The lead singer is very arresting in a tragic way. Creed is classic. One of my favorites is Hide and Don't Stop Dancing - superb!"
2,Its almost over,"TRACK 1:Lame.TRACK 2:Zilch.TRACK 3:Embarrassing faux Arabian chant and sound effects.TRACK 4:Revved up guitars.Still weak.TRACK 5:Wannabe ballad.More spiel.TRACK 6:A duet with Ed Vedder.Wait a minute.It's only Scott Stapp!TRACK 7:Tries too hard to be earnest and fails.TRACK 8:Not half bad,but still derivative.(Do these guys have one original idea?)TRACK 9:Awful singing.More failed earnestness.TRACK 10:O.K.Mellow.Nothing special.TRACK 11:Sweet but sappy.With a singer who over emotes every word of every song,a lead guitarist who has yet to come up with an original or interesting riff, or a band that as a whole has not improved one bit,you have little here besides a formulaic,totally derivative nonentity.I don't doubt Scott Stapp's sincerity but musicwise this band is the definition of mediocrity."
1,"You are NOT ""The New Led Zeppelin"", SHUTUP!","Ignore my review for ""My Own Prison"", saying that I still like that cd now & then... NO, I've officially decided that I am OFFICIALLY DONE WITH CREED- Yes, I liked My Own Prison for a while, but now they have just become too corny, bland, and annoying for me to listen to. Scott Stapp deserves a big punch in the face from Eddie Vedder or Jimmy Page, or maybe Jim Morrison should come down from heaven and give him a slap.....If I want this type of sound, two words: PEARL JAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I must confess...,"I must confess I have a soft spot for a lot of bad music, but this is really ridiculous. I mean the lead singer has good hair, but a nice 'do don't make good music. Just ask Flock of Seagulls. Anyway, I'm really tired of this fake, spiritual music that is as empty as most new-age mush. If you want really emotional and spiritual music, then I suggest you look elsewhere. However, Creed gets points on the album cover. It's really funny. Ha-ha, tree-people and they aren't even Druids."
5,Fabulous!,"This CD along with a few cups of Community New Orleans Blend Coffee with Chicory gets me wide awake and to work every day. I love every butt-kicking song on this awesome CD. Keep up the good work, guys!!!!"
3,It wasn't great,"My older brother loves creed, I listened to it because he listens to it a lot cause that's all he listens to. Their guitar and drummer are good. But he talks about himself too much and he sounds too country like. So I only give it a 3. It's ok though."
1,And this is music?,"Huh. A few bashing reviews in here. Well, let me add my own. The more people start to realize how terrible this band is the better. I have their first two albums, I'll admit that. But I will never *ever* buy this one. And who is actually buying this? I've never actually met someone with a copy of this disc. Well, if you like your metal bland, self-indulgent, over-grandizing, holier-than-thou, and just one big cliche, here you go. This is the band for you. I find Scott to be one of the most laughable front men in the music business, besides his nemesis Fred Durst. Why does that man think he's God? He needs serious ego-deflating ASAP. If you're going to listen to nu metal, pick a better band...even though I seriously advise against listening to nu metal anyway."
5,Mark Tremonti is awesome,"I read some other reviews and they did not do this cd justice. Weathered is twice as good as Human Clay. Much heavier and more meaningful. If you liked Human Clay, I think you'll like this cd! Mark Tremonti is incredably talented, and along with Stapp's lyrics and vocals, they are rocking!"
5,"great album, for 9$ or 139.99","this is classic bucket, i like that its on his heavy side. and as always, with the exeption of bucketheadland one, this is still availible at tdrs music, ran by the great travis dickerson, bucketheads longtime keyboardist and producer, i just got the mp3 album today for 9$ i do understand certian albums long out of print being sold so pricy, but here you could buy the album from the people who made it, and thats what it should be about!travis webstore is awesome, with many other artist including bill laswell, mp3s are avaible instantly, and he also ships very very fast;"
1,terrible-definitely not bucketheads best work,"this is a terrible album! There is very little buckethead, and what IS there sounds heavily sampled. This is a dj album, NOT a buckethead album. All of the songs are similar, and 2 or 3 of the 5 songs even start out the same way! This CD is representative of bucketheads more annoying side. Only a few times does buckethead actually play rhythm, and when he does its boring (think of a steady 16th note rhythm on E.) His mindless shredding is cool, but at least preface it with a good groove or riff!PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CD, ITS REALLLY BAD. Get GIANT ROBOT or MONSTERS AND ROBOTS if you want good buckethead"
5,"Loads of material. You""ll be inspired for months.","I've been using the Emedia Guitar CD-ROM for almost five months now and my progress is remarkable. Each newly taught guitar skill is backed up with songs and exercises to practice and refine that technique. My only problem with this product is the recorder is no better than the one included with most computers. The other built-in features (tuner, metronome and chord dictionary) are all very helpful. I've been going to a lot of free guitar tab sites and the chord dictionary is a great help for all those chords I haven't learned yet and are rarely written out. There is also a way to slow down any song on the program, which is very helpful now that I'm working on some more difficult stuff.I highly recommend this for anyone serious about learning."
2,If you just want to learn to play songs quickly,"If your looking to learn the guitar, and acquire skills where you can play it with some degree of proficency, I would suggest you also look at GuitarCoach. I purchased both eMedia as well as Guitar Coach, and now find myself learning primarily from Guitar Coach. Its very well structured for learning where you acquire real skills in a very interactive way. Guitar Method, on the other hand is designed more for those just want to play songs quickly (like I once did), but skips on teaching you the fundamental skills that you will soon be handicaped without."
5,Excellent Tool,I haven't played in about 10 years. This helped as a refresher course. Great presentation of the material.
4,"not as good as the 1st, but still worth a read","i liked the 1st book better, but this one was still good. An easy summer read!!!"
4,This novel is lots of fun!,"Set in new york, with lots of fashion and gossip, how it could it not be?"
4,Entertaining but Predictable,"I liked the ""Bergdorf Blondes"" more, but I also found this book entertaining. It is an easy read and I loved the ending even though it was predictable. I would love to see the author write more books about the ""Bergdorf Blondes""."
2,Quick but Unsatisfying Read,"I enjoyed Bergdorf Blondes -- obviously fluff, but a funny, lighted hearted chronicle of the pursuits of heiresses. Debutante Divorcees is flat -- an unending recitation of designer names, beauty treatments, party throwing, etc. -- with no characters or decent plot lines to relieve the tedium. In Debutante Divorcees, the author doesn't have any fun with her insanely shallow characters -- so it's difficult for a reader to have any fun with the book."
4,Fun book!,"I know a lot of people have trashed this book, but I thought it was a fun read. Bergdorf Blondes and Debutante Divorcee are SATIRICAL, and not meant to be taken seriously. I liked the premise of the book and the characters too. I read this book a few years ago, and now I am listening to it on a CD audiobook read by Sonya Walger, and I would highly recommend her narration."
2,I couldn't even finish it.,"I'm all about fluff and I love a good chick lit book, but I just could NOT get into this one to save my life. I tried, I really did, but it just could not grab my attention."
2,"Ugh, ugh, ugh","I first heard of this book in Vogue, the magazine for which Plum Sykes is a contributor, through a first serial (ie, an excerpt from the book printed in a magazine before it is published) that was reprinted there. Thinking I would like The Debutante Divorcee (because I thought Bergdorf Blondes was excellent), I went out and bought Sykes's new novel.I hated it; I think I'm being generous with my two stars. As a previous reviewer wrote, Plum Sykes makes Paula Abdul look intelligent.The characters are shallow and vapid and lack substance, especially the narrator, who I couldn't stand. The women who appear in The Debutante Divorcee are completely and utterly forgettable. I know that Plum Sykes's connection to one of the most widely-read women's magazines in the world is what got her books published in the first place; but someone should give Sykes a reality check as soon as possible and tell her that writing is simply NOT the career she should be persuing."
1,for the brain dead,"I enjoy a quick and easy read as much as the next girl, but this is just lazy and to put it plainly, dumb. I thought this would be a light read while I am 8 months pregnant and on bed rest, but I would have rather been forced to watch Baywatch re-runs."
1,Terrible,"Even though Syke's first book, Bergdorf Blondes was obviously no literary masterpiece, I still enjoyed it. It was quite funny and delicously, unapologetically shallow. However, The Debutante Divorcee was utter dribble. The characters were boring and one-dimensional, there was no plot to speak of, and the book's attempts to be ""funny"" fell flat, almost to the point where I felt sorry for the author, who is undoubtably going to be ridiculed for having actually written this. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Just Absurd,","Oh, poor Plume Sykes. She just cannot string a sentence together to save her life. This was an horrifying example of what passes for fiction today. Don't waste your time with this tripe. Thank Goodness, mine came from the library.Oh it's hilarious the author below me says this is no Davinci Code as if Davinci Code was some super serious book. NOT! However, this book makes Davinci Code look like War and Peace.If you want a good plot compared to this, try another book I read, called,The SAS Self-Defense Handbook: A Complete Guide to Unarmed Combat Techniques by John ""Lofty"" Wiseman. I am serious even that had a better plot than this one. (Actually that is a pretty good self defense book)Please Miss Sykes, stop writing and go get your hair done.I gave Miss Sykes a star to prove that she seems to know how to correctly punctuate a sentence here and there."
1,SO DULL!!!,"HORRIBLE!!! couldn't even finish it...not even beach-worthy...i think 100 chimps at typewriters could've written a better book...just a sham...not witty, not funny, not anything...a big, fat bore......DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A Waste of Time,It only got the 2 stars from me because 1. The cute title and 2. The cover. The book took forever to peak and was focused more on dropping designer names than giving us a plot.
1,Dropped it after 5 pages of reading.,"This book felt like a mindless chatter to me. I picked this book up after reading rave reviews about it. The first few pages talks about rich girls being divorced, it failed very terribly to hold my attention. I know I am being very critical here, but it just didn't do it for me."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have read the reviews of this book, and I have to say that I disagree with most of them. I really enjoyed this book, and had a hard time putting it down. While the characters may be shallow, they are entertaining and funny. The plot is quick and actually kept me guessing up until the end. I would recommend this book to others who are looking for a fun summer read."
1,Terrible,"Don't bother. Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller. Maybe it was just pure luck."
1,Trash,"This book was so incredibly vapid. The plot was contrived, and there were no likeable characters whatsoever. Sykes tries for social satire but this is as bad as sitting next to an person at a dinner party who claims to know the society you are in, but is instead an unlikable elitist. It is obvious she got this book published on her name alone which may be more shameful than the book itself."
4,Absolute FUN,"What can I say, I like a little fluffy chick lit... This book is just that. As with Bergdorff Blondes, the main character is a little more grounded than the rest of her friends, but the outrageousness of their riches just makes it a fun, fantastastical, escapist read. Don't we all sometimes wish that the biggest decision in our life was what dress to wear?!"
2,Completely Underwhelmed,"I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite. I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling. Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes. Methinks PS could do better."
2,Totally ridiculous... and not in a good way.,"I agree with every review I've read above. The characters aren't developed, the plotline went in circles, and the conclusion is totally implausible. The ending comes out of nowhere, as if the author was trying to wrap things up quickly. Don't waste your time, it's not funny or fabulous."
3,Vapid Paris Hilton Wannabees without much pizazz,"I found this book really disappointing. After Plum Sykes debut novel I expected better. The characters in this were vapid, Paris Hilton-esque types. I found it difficult to bother, or even care about their whims, and fancies.The premise was that every NY girl has their divorce celebration and goes off on holiday happy. Frankly the whole idea stunk from the start and got no better after that."
2,Another vapid novel,"I agree with those reviewers who said this novel is little more than an endless parade of the young and fabulous, who care more about clothing than their own happiness, and who think that marriage is more about finding the man with the most money than finding love. It does a disservice to women who look for more in life than the next party or couture designer. I do enjoy chick lit, but this novel is a sad representation of that genre. I am only glad I borrowed this book instead of wasting money on it!"
4,A Delicious Souffle,Breezey light summer reading. A Field Guide to designer labels and fashion icons woven inside a bubbly look at young New York society. One caveat is that readers unfamiliar with the jet set world in which it takes place may not get some of the humour. A definite must for this summer's (designer) beach bag.
1,Don't waste your time,I was told that if I liked Sex in the City then I would love this book. Not true. The characters are so plastic it's amazing and the writing is so simplistic. I wrote a story similar to this when I was in high school. I wish I had known that I could publish it and make lots of money....maybe I should pull that old story out of the closet.
2,Predictable and light beach read,"The characters are one-dimensional at best. The storyline was completely predictable (you'll see the not-so-suprise ending coming a mile away). And the writing is, well, just not that good (dialogue and description are not this author's strong suit). But it was a light, somewhat fun beach read. Totally forgettable, but a guilty indulgence that wasn't entirely regrettable."
1,This book is now serving as my doorstop.,"If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep."
4,Cute,"Not a lot of substance, but this is still a very cute read about shallow NYC women. I enjoyed it, though it was easy to see the ending coming at you. I borrowed this from the library, maybe that's why I can be so generous in my review...."
2,rediculous and hard to believe,"This story is just as ridiculous and hard to believe, which also just makes it another funny book that's easy to read at the beach. Don't expect anything too serious, you can finish this in a day or two."
5,A Wonderful Book,"I got this book for Christmas one year and before reading it, I didn't think it was going to be good. (Just by the tittle) I read this book and it was awesome! This book was funny and I liked the characters in it. I was surprised to see bad words in it though. I finished it and will read it again some day."
1,Has this woman ever even talked to another real person?,"I have a hard time believing the author is serious with this book. It's like she's trying to give us some biting social satire, but instead comes off as a pretentious, shallow egoist.I hated how the main character always pretends to express horror or disapproval at the things her new friends do, but then she goes headlong right along with them and is just as bad as anyone. The character don't always make sense, and I think that some of them exist just so that Sykes can talk about the stuff they're wearing.I like Sykes' editorial work sometimes, but this novel is crap and I feel like a fool for spending money on it, even in paperback. USED."
2,No where near as good as Bergdorf Blondes,"If you have read Bergdorf Blondes and are thinking that this will be right up there with it, it isn't. I has character's that are whiney and believe they are entitled. It took me awhile to finish it because of how horribly written it truly was. This is a leave it at the store but if you must read it borrow it from the library book. The only reason i finished it was because i don't ever not finish a book, but this was one i seriously considered not finishing."
3,Check your Brain and Enjoy a Shallow Swim in Fantasyland,"Funny, silly, stupid, vain...yep, but it gives you a distraction from whatever is going on. Sort of like those crazy 50 year old soap operas where the same guy has died 14 times and yet digs himself out of the grave... You know it isn't true yet you still watch. This is the same. It is just fun. I think if more people bothered to just think of entertainment as fun and not as something they have to pull apart and put under a microscope and determine if it even is possible there would be more silly, crazy, and goofy books written.Get the book on CD and listen to the lady read it with her English accent... Maybe you'd love it. :-)"
4,entertaining,"i dont understand why so many people have been so hard on this book. if you read bergdorf blondes you should have known what to expect and i thought that this book was a lot of fun and gave us a look at another high end lifestyle that most of us dont live in. it is funny and yes it is light and shallow, but i think it is still very enjoyable.not as good as bergdorf blondes but a great summer book anyway. if you are looking for a fun and glamorous book, then you should really get this!"
1,Worse than awful,"Insufferable characters, idiotic plot, boring story, terrible writing... Plum Sykes needs to find a new job, preferably one that doesn't involve her using a word processor. Whoever told this woman she could write is an idiot."
2,A Disappointing Follow-Up,"Where Bergdorf Blondes was delightfully witty and tongue-in-cheek, The Debutante Divorcee picks up with a character who never quite develops a sympathetic narrative ""voice."" At times cheesy and painfully laden with cliches, this novel fails to be fun. Half the time, I wondered if Plum Sykes actually had authored this novel-- it was so different from her debut! I hope she can find the delicious character ""Moi"" she invented for Bergdorf Blondes so her 3rd novel will actually live up to the hype!"
2,Not what I expected,"I adored Bergdorf Blondes, and was anxiously awaiting this book. I thought the premise was interesting, and thought it would be funny, but after reading a few pages I found it it wasn't. The characters in BB were shallow AND interesting. The charactters of DD were shallow and not interesting at all. The plot (if you could call it that) was flimsy and, while it's a very fast read, it had none of the charm that BB had. It was a fast read, but unlike BB, I was actually glad to be done with it. Definitely didn't live up to my expectations."
1,It's not what you know,"Oh, I had been looking forward to this. Does Miramax get the advance back - it's pretty awful."
1,Worst Book,"This is the worst book I've read in my life (and I read A LOT). If I were Plum Sykes, I'd be so mortified by it, I would buy every copy in stock and burn them."
2,Not a Plum choice!,"Ugh! I picked this book up thinking it would be as much fun as Bergdorf Blondes and was sadly disappointed. The main character is completely paranoid by the thought of her new husband cheating on her and the paranoia is only made worse by her new best friend - the Divorcee in the title. I suffered through the book hoping it would get better, but it never did. The characters are horrible, self centered, shallow women with no redeeming qualities. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,easy read,"I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as Sykes first novel ""Blondes"". However shallow and forgettable the characters may be, the book is an easy, don't have to think about it, read. It also did enough site dropping to encourage some internet searches. Easy, good, beach read."
2,Buyers: Take Note!,"Just want to point out to buyers that the Publisher as SOCIETY OF ILLUSTRATORS and Published Year as 1974 stated here on Product Information page is INCORRECT; the stated Title though IS accurate. I bought this USED expecting it to be the SOCIETY OF ILLUSTRATORS volume (#15) published in 1974 (as Products page detail states), but instead received a volume published in 1996 from a different Society altogether - AMERICAN ILLUSTRATION, on West 19th St, in NYC. So, if, like me, you wanted the 1974 Society of Illustrators volume, please NOTE the two used volumes still linked herewith are NOT it. * I did give the volume 2 stars because I'm not saying it's not also a quality volume of American Illustration, it's just misleading as described and want to save another from possible disappointment in purchasing."
1,Blah...,I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched. Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American. Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood. So I thought I would give this one a try.I really wanted to like this movie. It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick. I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop). Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it. Way too thick for me.
3,This film was ok,"I read up on what this DVD is all about, but as I was viewing the movie several times I could not understand what was going on. I think this movie has some merit, but I would not recommend buying it.I did not have a problem with it being a silent movie and the sub-titles did help somewhat, but over all nothing I can see watching."
2,Impressionist Revolutioon,"Eisenstein's Tenth Anniversary recreation of the October Uprising certainly isn't designed to educate about the event, it is meant to stir the passions of remembrance. Someone unfamiliar with the events will be pretty lost as far as understanding how the events unfold. Eisenstein's montage style reaches nearly impressionistic levels as the sense of story, which was strong, if undeveloped, in ""Strike"", and faded a bit in his second film,Battleship Potemkin, is nearly abandoned for ""October"" in favor of impressionistic intercutting. The film montage technique which was used in service of story inStrikeandBattleship Potemkinhad become technique in service of itself."
1,"NOISY, no the NOISIEST!","This regulator works on my 1975 Ford Courier, but it is so noisy. And this noise comes at random times when the engine is running.Since it is mounted on the firewall the vibrations travel through to the interior and it is NOISY>>>Is there a replacement available that doesn't make noise???"
5,No place to be a child,"With children and violence a hot issue in America, this book focuses on the effects war has on children. Of course, injury and loss of loved ones are at the top of the list, but so are less obvious detriments like barriers to education and health care. It also discusses the mental impact that war and violence has on children for years to come. Final section transforms discussion from international wars to similar impacts for American children in violent inner cities.Would like to see an update with new case studies like Sierra Leone, Iraq and Columbine. But, regardless, the book is still quite an eye-opener which can convince even the most hawkish warmonger that the ""collateral"" damage to youth from war/violence is long-term and potentially irreversible."
2,Riot - Fire Down Under,"Two out of five stars for the music ONLY! My vinyl transfer sounds better than the CD version. The mix seems to feature a lead hi-hat. Very little low end. A spectrun analysis revealed how bably this thing was ""remixed"". I still like the music though. Brings back a lot of memories."
5,What A Great Period It Was In Rock Music,"Riot was an outstanding rock band. Their first four albums were some of the best heavy metal of the time, but their second & third albums ""Narita"" and ""Fire Down Under"" were landmark recordings. If you want to experience some extraordinary hard rock, pick up these two albums.This was a great era in rock history: the late 70's/early 80's hard rock. Before we had all digital effects and before the studio engineers destroyed albums with extreme reverb and loud drums drowning out the rest of the band, there was this short period of just plain great hard rock, not too over-produced. Riot was one of the best in that genre. Seems like they were only known in certain circles, and I would have never heard of them had it not been for a guitarist I knew back then who had their albums. They were such an underrated band and deserved a lot more recognition.This is a review of the material, not a review of the CD quality."
5,Quality example of early Eighties rock/metal,"Growing up in the early Eighties and rocking to bands comprising the NWOBHM and the emerging metal scene in the U.S., you'd think that one would be familiar with RIOT. I had never heard of them until two weeks ago when I happened to stumble across a review of them here on Amazon. I'm blown away. I am obsessed with this album. It rocks front to back (with the possible exception of the two bonus tracks at the end - depends on your taste). Definitely one of the top 100 metal albums of all time. They have a sound all their own. In my opinion, the guitar solo during the final two minutes of 'Feel The Same' is the highlight of the album. Anyone obsessed with early Eighties metal, or a fan of good rock guitar solos, should definitely add this masterpiece to their collection. 'Fire Down Under' is solid and will not dissapointe. It's heavy, melodic, and motivating and the musicianship and vocals are first rate. A superb effort from RIOT."
5,One of Hard Rock's Finest Packages EVER !,"Riot is one of the few bands I still listen to from the early days. Mark's guitar melodies are amazing, and Guy's vocals are addictive even today. Just one of those rare bands that were made to make music together, and FIRE DOWN UNDER is one of their finest pieces. Check out their album just before this called NARITA (if you can find it). Riot is still a secret to many Rock fans. Buy this, and you too will see that this is what its all about !"
5,Late 70's/Early 80's Heavy Metal at its BEST!!,"FIRE DOWN UNDER is one awesome CD. The guitar work, drums, and overall songs are second to none. Fast (and I mean FAST) paced songs that have you taking a breath in between songs. Songs like ""Run For Your Life"", ""No Lies"", and the title track will bring big smiles to those fans of early Iron Maiden (like the first Iron Maiden album). FIRE DOWN UNDER was orignally released on LP in 1981, and the CD was remastered and released in 1997. The CD has a heavier ""base guitar"" and ""drum"" mix than the original LP (in my opinion), so the excellent guitar work of Reale and Ventura is somewhat masked, but considering the alternative (i.e. not owning this excellent musical production), I still highly recommend it's purchase. You won't regret it. FIRE DOWN UNDER is a true 5-Star Heavy Metal CD. NOW GO ON AND BUY IT!!"
5,The Ultimate Metal CD,"Riot's ""Fire Down Under"" is the ultimate metal CD. Every song is killer. I've listened to it a zillion times since 81 and it never gets old. These guys deserve a spot in the Metal Hall of Fame."
5,Metal the way it should be!!!!!,"In a world that has lost touch with the greatest genre of music of all time, Riot with Guy Sperenza at the healm was the fastest and most honorable band to represent heavy metal. After purchasing ""Fire Down Under"" I was so happy to be reintroduced to the band that I wore out both my cassette tapes listening to in my high school years. Those were the best years of my life and Riot will not be forgotten. This is their definitive collection of hard rock and should never be forgotten. Long live the Riot of the 80's. Check it out!!!!!!!"
4,"Terrific, Melodic Driving Metal","One of better metal albums of the early 80's. Consistently good songs: fast, catchy, with great vocals. Standouts include ""Swords and Tequila"", ""Outlaw"" and ""Run For Your Life"". In terms of straight metal, right up there with The Rods, Manowar, Priest, Maiden and Dio....plus you have to laugh at the horrible cover art."
3,Hiking trail book,"I do a lot of hiking in the Southern Sierra's. I purchased this book for a trail guide. It is a bit dated and some of the trails the book mentions no longer exist. They have been blocked buy individuals who have purchased the property and have fenced off the trails.No tresspassing signs up. After talking with local Rangers one of the trails has been ""Off the list"" for some time. The book is a great tool however for the Southern Sierra's."
4,In A Zone That Was On The Move,"An Edgar Froese solo project billed as Tangerine Dream - he is the composer, producer, co-engineer and is responsible for all the instruments - the 13-track video soundtrack was released on January 25, 1996.Jerome Froese is listed as a co-composer on two numbers - The Conspiracy and Missing Link - and a saxophone is featured throughout, though the sound is probably programmed on a synthesizer. Each track is complete, with the clockings between 3:08 and 5:56, which is a plus, considering the abbreviated numbers that appear on other TD soundtracks.Tangerine Dream was in a transition period as Edgar Froese was moving the group to its own label. The soundtrack may be lost in the mix, but it is solid electronica that does not diminish the legacy of group."
2,Tasty but still somewhat stale...What a Babe!!!,"I share some of the feelings of similar reviewers - I wish there were more photos in here not previously published. Still this book is a great collection of some of her best photos - including the outstanding Demarchelier nudes. It's also spiced up with some great comments by Laetitia herself, although I was rather disappointed by the comments on her love life: darnit, and I hoped she was saving herself for me! But THE BIGGEST LETDOWN was the low quality paper it was printed on, and they certainly could have included a lot more great photos. I realize they probably wanted to keep the price low, but I'm sure that with as many devoted fans as she has they could have produced a $60 product a still made a mint. DIS-LUI BIENDES CHOSES AMOUR"
3,"Good, but it could have been so much better.","This book falls somewhere between the PG-rated Claudia Schiffer ""Memories"" book and the all out skin-fests of the Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss titles. Most of the photos have already been seen in such places as Vogue, Sports Illustrated, Photo (the French edition of American Photo magazine), Rolling Stone, Victoria's Secret, Guess? ads, etc. Sadly, no behind-the-scenes shots of the Ritts Rolling Stone or Pirelli calendar sessions are included, nor are any from the Demarchelier sessions (the 2 that are included are from his book ""Forms""). In fact, many Laetita fans will have the bulk of these photos already. On the plus side, there are a few previously unseen shots and a lot of Laetitia quotes, and it does collect some prime photos in one handy hardcover book. One last thing: her quote on page 111 is the most devastating news I've heard this month."
4,somewhat disappointing,"i find it somewhat disappointing that the whole book is a mere collection of casta's previous works. needless to say, the 4-stars represent the attractiveness of casta."
3,"""Laetitia"" is like a great beauty with spinach on her teeth.","Laetitia Casta is, of course, a spectacularly beautiful and shapely model, and the photographers represented in the eponymous book are among the best and most fashionable in the world. Alas, the photos are vandalized by the worst reproduction and printing quality in a photo book in recent years. Previews of the book in ""Photo"" and other magazines carry greatly superior reproductions of the images which here are out of focus and muddy. ""Forms"", by Patrick Demarchelier, carries several of the same images and a comparison of the two books is utterly humiliating for the dreadful Laetitia. As for the color images -- well, only the mini poster glued to the back cover offers anything worth viewing. Don't buy the book without seeing it first, so you can be sure of what you are -- and are not -- getting."
3,Not the best they could have done with stunning beauty,"This book is sort of like an extended puff piece magazine article, with many glossy vogue-style photos. Laetitia is gorgeous, though these are not necessarily the best or sexiest photos of her by any means. A kind of collector's item tribute to a model of our time."
4,I Spy : Treasure Hunt and Fantasy..,"I bought these games for my nieces and nephew.. Somehow, ended up playing them all night... Why was that?... There were five of us big kids and a half a case of beer... LOL...."
4,Can't finish the map!,"My children, ages 7, enjoyed the Spooky Mansion much better. There seemed to be an easier navigation than the Treasure Hunt. They were also raised to like monsters and such so the Spooky Mansion fit right in. I rated this 4 stars because of the harder task of navigating. I do like that it is just like the books which I am a huge fan of. Overall, it's fun and great in teaching kids to read and understand what they are reading."
2,The sound skips with the sentences and I can't even finish the map whatsover!,"I'm stupendously disappointed in I SPY Treasure Hunt deeply! I have I SPY Treasure Hunt book, I SPY Fantasy PC, and I SPY Treasure Hunt PC. I liked the book better than the computer game for too many reasons to think up. First off, when I hear the sound when the girl or boy says the item to find it just skips! Secondly, I've never been able to complete the map findings because there's no item to find that I'm looking for! The third one, there isn't any fun or exciting music in the background when you find an object whatsoever. No offense to any I SPY fans here!"
5,Excellent game for all ages,I hesitated buying this because I had read several reviews concerning the sound problem. There was a sound fix inluded in the copy I purchased and since we installed it the game has been used each week for several months. This game is one of the few things my 7 and 16 year old will sit and do together. I even get caught up in the process and soon we have a crowd gathered around the computer screen trying to find the 5th boat! This is simply a fun and exciting game for all ages.
5,time well spent,"I first downloaded I Spy Game for my grandson, and we just loved it but then the time ran out and he was very sad, so I went looking for one that I could buy and play any time that we wanted and we found this one and it is great, you can spend time together learning and finding wonderful things in so many different rooms. The time goes by so fast because you are having a wonderful time playing this game. I highly recommend this for all ages."
4,A game for all ages...,"This game is really fun for the whole family. Even my parents enjoyed playing this game, even if it says ages 6-10 on the cover.It is just like the I spy books, except after you have solved all the riddles you get to find the hidden tresure. There is only one bad thing about this game. You can only play it once or twice because after a while you know where all the objects are. It is still worth it. Parents, if you get this for your child, I suggest you try it too. It is really fun!"
4,Great game for everyone.,"My pre-schooler son asked for this game. He loves it, and so do we. It lets us spend a lot of quality family time together searching for small hidden items. It also gives us an opportunity to teach him new words.Only problem was that its sound quality. Sometimes last portions of a sentence are lost."
1,Mac Users Beware!,"The product description is wrong, this is NOT OSX software. It's OS9 and can only be run in ""Classic"" environment. Any Mac purchased in the last two years, at least, does not come with OS9. You would need to have OS9 installed on your computer in addition to OSX. This will definitely affect the performance of the software and your machine in general.I contacted the company - great_deals_software - and received a very unsatisfactory response. You'd think a company selling computer software would understand the differences between operating systems and be willing to correct the product description.As far as the game itself, I'm sorry I have to leave 1 star, but I was unable to run it."
3,average game,My children have had this CD for about a year and they've used it only a few times the first few weeks. It has not held their interest as long as some of their other computer games.
4,Good educational game,I bought this for a boy of 12 who goes to school in German. He speaks English at home with his mother. I think that this game will help him with his English.
2,Sound problems,"My son loves I Spy Fantasy and Haunted House. We were very excited about Treasure Hunt. But much to our dismay, the program has a sound problem. The voice over cuts off before the end of the sentence or discription. Fortunately, my son already had experience with the other programs so he wasn't totally frustrated."
5,Good for kids and Adults,"Let's face it... most children's software gets boring after awhile, especially for the adults who have to help. This one does not....I bought this for my five year old daughter three months ago, and she is still playing it. What is interesting is that a week after we purchased the game, her father and I stayed up until 2am looking for items we had trouble finding while attempting to help her."
2,A disapointment: short on details,"I purchased this book expecting a detailed look at the workings of the F-16 and was disappointed.The book provides little in terms of technical details on the F-16 and serves more as a general history of the aircraft. There isn't even a detailed listing of the aircraft's dimensions.The book does cover a bit of the F-16s combat record with an account of an Israeli pilot's air-to-air combat kill in an F-16. The account itself however isn't very riveting.If I had looked through this book at a a bookstore, I would have passed on it."
2,Not that great!,"This program is basically good for learning except that it is almost impossible to get to the lessons you want, especially if you want to review. It kept giving me tests on letters I hadn't learned. It is frustrating and I wouldn't recommend it."
5,exactly what I expected,"This product was exactly as advertised, a replacement charger for my camera battery. It arrived promptly, and I was happy with the service."
5,A very good small gun,"Although this is a small gun, it is very good for water fights. i have one and i am going to buy another! I think everone should buy one. just don't tell my friends were to buy one, i would like to stay dry!"
3,Too much Elvis not enough plot,Very Disappointing. So different from the previous books in this series. Way too much Elvis trivia not enough of the cast of characters I have grown to love. The only reason I made it to the end of this book was the hope that the next one will be better and I will need to know what went before. My advise... borrow it from the library. But don't give up on the series yet.
3,Good story- too much trivia,"enjoyed the book, but it was so wordy and loaded with trivia that I found myself skimming and skipping a lot just to get to the plot."
2,Least favorite in the series,"I have read all the books in the Midnite Louie series, and this one was definitely my least favorite. Maybe because I was never an Elvis fan, but I just didn't find all the Elvis trivia and impersonator stuff interesting. Like several other readers, finishing the book was a chore, not really a pleasure like usual. I hope the next book gets back on track."
2,"Love the series, but this is the weakest link","The author substituted Elvis trivia for character development and made EVERY major character spout said trivia at the drop of a hat. Maybe having one avid fan pop in with some tidbits now and again would have been bearable, but this felt almost like a lecture with a few murders thrown in. The lack of susbtance shows."
5,Best Holy Modal Rounders Album,"This has always been my favorite album by the HMR. Why it isn't available as a CD at a normal price from Rounder Records is a mystery to me. I understand that there's some kind of squabble about the royalties, but Rounder should suck it up and make nice with Stampfel and Weber. The Holy Modal Rounders are the namesake of Rounder Records after all. Everybody that's a fan should get a hold of Rounder Records and ask them what's up with this?"
4,A great workout but requires a lot of equipment,"This is a really great workout. Like the product summary says, exercises are done one set to failure with heavy weights. She tells you what weights she uses for each exercise, but you can use whatever is appropriate for your fitness level. This is purely a gym style weightlifting workout, it doesn't have a cardio element like ""The Firm"" style workouts. It has a lot of exercises you won't find in other DVDs, which is a great way to keep your workouts fresh and effective. (I love the wrist curls for grip strength, you don't see that in other DVDs!)However, a few criticisms: She works the same muscle groups several times (there are at least 3 or 4 tricepts exercises), and that doesn't make sense to me since she is trying to fit so many different exercises in one workout. Also she uses a lot of equipment. If you don't have a weight bench there are a couple of exercises you can modify but a couple of them you'd just have to skip."
1,didn't like!,I bought this a few days ago and I usually like this colone for my son and it smelled old like it had expired it didn't have a date on the bottle but didn't smell like it use to.
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this cologne and I received a 1/4 bottle of it. Now I want everybody knows that you are a whole bunch of crap trying to fool honest people
5,I use this book all the time!,"This book is a great resource for anyone with a cutting garden, a love of flowers, or a romantic husband. It's full of great tips for all different types of flowers and has allowed me to increase the longevity of the bouquets I receive.I liked it so much that I bought one for mother's day.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it shows flowers being cut in air when they should always be cut underwater!"
3,pretty pictures.,"This is a beautiful book, but I was looking for more information about cut flowers used in floral design. It is a good book for general reference."
4,Great book!,"I was very pleased with this purchase. Flowers are sort of a hobby of mine and I've purchased several flower guides and floral arranging books throughout the years... often finding that only a small fraction of the pages in these provide any practical guidance. This book was a refreshing surprise. It is fantastic for referencing different types of flowers... although it would be nice if the flower dictionary was a bit longer (hence my one-star deduction). Each flower in the dictionary gives you a wealth of information including; meaning, origin, season and availability, cost, and meaning.This book also offers plenty on caring for cut flowers, tools and arranging. Just a lot of useful information."
4,Red Line Shokproof In WRX Transmission,"This gear oil is very protective against gear to gear wear. it is pretty thick, and it seems to have made a positive difference in my transmissions feel and performance. i would recommend it to anyone who is replacing transmission or rear differential fluid."
5,Red Line gear oil,Works great! Gears last longer and the price is just a bit higher than other lesser products. Shipped and packed properly a god deal.
5,You Probably Won't Find a Better Value,I take a couple tablespoons in the morning and then anytime my blood sugar seems to drop to keep my hunger and cravings at bay. My gut feels much better too. This Jarrow brand is great.
4,glutamine,the price was fair delivery was fast and the product is performing well i would recommend this product and seller to others and will be purchasing more products in the future.
1,Do NOT trust this author!!!!,"This man has just settled ANOTHER law suit with a former patient!! A few years back a former ""patient"" received 4.5 million, a few months ago another one received 6.5. His record of abuse and neglect of adolescents is frightening...if you are truly looking for help with a troubled teen...look elsewhere. His methods are based on brainwashing techniques used on OUR KOREAN WAR POWs and treatment modalities developed by SYNANON - A KNOWN CULT!!!!!"
1,MILLER NEWTON IS A CHILD ABUSER,DO NOT READ THIS DO NOT TRUST MILLER NEWTON DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD HE WRITES GO TO WWW.FORNITS.COM AND WWW.THESTRAIGHTS.COM FOR ALL THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS ON MILLER NEWTON DO NOT TRUST THIS MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Please do your homework first,Please investigate this author. He has a very shocking past dealing with teens.
2,Guiding youth to Behavior Modification Facilities,Dr. Phil recenlty send a 15-year old girl to a reportedly abusive behavior modification program - Provo Canyon School. The punitive measures used at this particular program would be considered torture by many. This is not the way to guide youth to be productive and caring adults. Tough behavior modification programs like Provo Canyon School have recently been under fire as professional organizations have recently determined that their methods are ineffective and brutal. His recomendations for this type of intervention makes one question his professionalism.
3,"Not bad, diverting","I got this after I picked up Gothic on sale and found it was playable.Gothic 2 is better, a bit plodding sometimes but you generally get your money's worth.My computer, a 1.4 Ghz Dell, .75 Gigs mem running W2K with a 32MB GeForce would freeze on occasion, the only cure being a reboot.Even so, the game design is good, graphics are interesting. But I found the ending a tad disappointing."
4,Pretty Good,"This has to be the best game I've seen since Morrowind III. I have to give kudos to the developers for the excellent graphics & sound. However, the game is not THAT addictive, and the plot is a bit cliche'. Also, the lack of turn-based fighting drives me up the wall. Still, it's pretty darn good."
1,Unbelievable bugs,"As many of the reviewers of this game have mentioned, the story and gameplay of gothic 2 is outstanding. However, the bugs and crashes that occur with this game are as bad as they get. If you have ever played ""Temple of Elemental Evil"" and screamed at all the hours you wasted when the game crashed, you have a small taste of what you are in for in gothic 2. These are not subtle crashes, either. These are shut-down-your-computer bugs. Worst of all, there is NO english language patch available. I would never consider buying another game from JoWood studios again if this is how they support their products."
1,TRASH,"This game sucks Big Time!I have played tons of RPG's, and I never put down a game unless it absolutely deserves it and this one certainly does.As many stated already, the controls are horrible. You have to like push the up arrow key and then click the left mouse botton while trying to keep yourself in line with the enemie(s) to even stike a blow, and God forbid you have more than one enemy after you at a time.The graphics, sound and realism is nice but what good is that if you cannot fight your enemies effectively.Honestly, I think any game is better than this garbage dump.Save your cash and pass on this one."
4,"Looks good, but why all the delays?","Gothic was a good game. Gothic 2 should be a better game. I've been waiting for this game for months, why all the delays. According to Gothic2.com the only thing left to do is translate the script from German to English. This can also be logically deduced, as the game is already out in Germany. Is Gothic 2 really that long, or are the translaters braindead? I'm also hoping that Gothic 2 will have some better graphics and fewer bugs than Gothic. If Gothic 2 lives up to be all it's hyped up to be, it should be a great game."
5,utterly original and astonishing,"This has become my all-time favorite film. It is truly hard to express how breathtaking, awe-inspiring and joyful this film is once it sinks into you. It must be watched numerous times. This is the only film I have watched back to back on two separate occasions. It utterly lacks traditional characters and plot; its lulling rhythm distracts the viewer from how revolutionary a film it is. There is no other film remotely like Playtime. It has to be one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century in any genre.The Criterion print is for the most part great. Do not watch this on full-screen video under any circumstances."
5,Du grand Tati,"J'ai vu ce film de Tati pendant la periode des Fetes 2003a la tele de Radio-Canada. Pour moi,Jacques Tati est un grandmaitre du cinema.Il a un style bien particulier. J'ai eu la joie de lui serrer la main il y a plusieurs annees lors d'une rencontre de presse au Chateau Frontenac a Quebec.De bien beaux souvenirs.Je constate que Playtime est disponible moyennant 100 dollars US sur Amazon.com mais je ne vois aucun prix sur Amazon.ca. Dommage..."
2,Not Original Letterbox,"Terry Jones, who in a Special Feature introduces PLAYTIME, reminds us that it was originally released in 70 mm. Illustrations to his talk show us clips from the film at a 2.35:1 ratio, which is usual for 70 mm. BUT the movie itself, as shown in the Criterion Collection, has a different ratio: 1.85:1 or less, which is closer to the Standard Format. The true letterbox clips shown in the Terry Jones intro look much better than the film on this DVD. Criterion claims to restore the original letterbox, but it doesn't. Unless people like me, who want the 2.35:1 ratio of the original, object, companies like Criterion will continue to hoodwink us."
3,Not what it seems,"Both the introduction (by Terry Jones) and the blurb on this DVD talk about Tati's ""70mm"" epic. The original (1967) was in 70mm (aspect ration 2.2:1) and had stereo sound, but what has been restored here is the American version (which Tati authorised in 1972) which is in mono and widescreen (aspect ratio 1.85:1).This not made at all clear on the packaging."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCTION,This DVD is useless. It is poorly produced with a mismatch between speech and action on the screen and the content is very poor. I do not recommend.It will not tech you anything that you cannot learn from the manual or the website of Steinberg. If I could I would claim my money back.
1,Not a good buy!,"I would not recommend buying this bicycle for everyday use. The components are very cheap and the bicycle is too heavy to lug around every day. The brake pads wore out after about a week, the chain is too long, the derailer is too noisy and jerky even after calibrating, the wheels must be trued as they come very unbalanced, the brakes are plastic and feel very cheap. If you live in a hilly area, this bike is going to be a nightmare. Weighing in at almost 50 pounds, this solid steel bike will wear out your legs even before you make it up the hill. Overall, I would recommend spending a little more money and buying a quality bike with quality components with a light frame."
4,Not a bad bike for the price,"Not a bad bike for the price. Took about 20 minutes to assemble it. It does have some issues, such as very noisy brakes. But I think that is from the brake pad material contacting the steel wheel rims. I also had to take the front wheel to the bike shop to have it 'trued up' as it had a definate 'wow' in it. So, all in all, not bad for an entry level bike."
5,Hot!Hotter!Fuji!,"As I only knew Juju-Music before,it was hitting me like a knockout-punch when I first heard this CD! Fuji is all I was waiting for and King Wasiu has made me a fan for life.This thriving beat is going to the body to rise you from any chair and it is not letting go. I have this CD for some time now and it is one of the most frequently played ones, it never fails to lift me up. A must for anybody even remotly interested in African or Nigerian music!"
3,Don the Dragon returns,"This was an average movie with the one true standout being that Paulo Tocha(Paco the Tai fighter from Bloodsport, Born to defence ect.) is here to be the for hide tough guy who doesn't get to display any of his Tai fighting skill and gets his neck snapped. Bad use of talent if you ask me. Don the dragon offers his standard fare as usual."
5,Bunn 12 Cup Standard Decanter,I am using this with my standard $20 coffee maker. The pots that come with the $20 maker all dribble when you pour a cup of coffee or if you're filling the reservoir. The Bunn decanter does not drip at all and this works great for me.....
1,Does not ship,"Ordered from Amazon/Shoplet, credit card was charged, waited 2 weeks no shipment. When I followed up they canceled the order saying it was no longer available, however it's still listed as in stock. don't order this one, use another vendor."
3,"OK - but no ""stopper"" supplied","OK, everyone knows...Bunn decanters have a planned obsolescence. The glass ones separate from the plastic top, and the plastic ones have a seam down the middle where you pour so it has the maximum chance of failure. However, you pays your money and takes your chances. That being said...why no stopper for the top? There must be 15 models of decanters and each has a different opening size. Just charge $1.99 more and give me a stopper so that the fluid that passes as coffee from these systems can at least stay warm"
5,Basic homemaking for an observant Jewish woman.,"This book gives the basic ideas about scheduling,meal planning,storage,housecleaning,and time management,geared for an observant Jewish woman.And the first piece of advice is something very to the point - pray for help!It has parts about preparing for the Jewish holidays and Shabbos,with regards to cleaning,scheduling,and cooking.Good general info;but if you want only hints,get something else in addition.This book,while giving hints,gives more of a general ideas and attitudes.Useful."
5,Great game,"This is a great game. It has a whole bunch of scenarios to play so it doesn't go stale in a week. The best part is that you can edit and create units and buildings yourself! There are tons of units and buildings online to download that have been made by other gamers so you aren't stuck doing the same thing over and over again. For the price, I think it is a must have!"
1,Tries to access non-existing websites all the time,"I haven't been able to use it. It tries to access non-existing websites and crashes. I have spend just about 30 minutes on it, and do not think I am going to waste any more of my time on it."
3,I don't know,"I never played this game, but got it cause it's free after rebate. It'll be a good frisbee."
5,Great sweat band,"light weight and works well! I use it very often when I ride. It was easy to find too, I just typed in headsweats and there it was."
2,Riding Blind,"Avid cyclist looking for a solution to sweat in the eyes during those warm days. Ordered this and after one ride I can say that it's not going to cut it. The weather was only in the low 80's and I was sweating very little, but the headband was saturated in a very short time. Once saturated, it's worse then not having a headband because it started to drip on to my glasses. I do not recommend this product to any cyclist who sweats more then a hummingbird because you'll find yourself unsatisfied and riding blind."
3,Headsweats Headband,Purchased this Headband on Amazon & I am Fairly unimpressed. The day I wore it in Ohio it was not that hot or humid low 80's & about 72% & I am not a Runner who Sweats Heavily. Soaked it through & had sweat running down my Nose. About an hour later it still was not dry and it had been laying on the Kitchen table & the AC was on in the house. Will stick with my Ratty Nike Featherlite Visor.
4,Simply Red and the Best!,"Simply Red was truly a British band of the 1980s. They were introduced to me by Music Television or MTV as it was known to release first with the single ""Holding Back The Years,"" or was it ""If you Don't Know Me By Now."" ""Stars"" is also a classic from their heyday. There are other songs that I am not too familiar with like ""Money's Too Tight To Mention,"" ""The Right Thing,"" ""It's Only Love,"" ""A New Flame,"" ""You've Got It,"" ""Something Got Me Started,"" ""Thrill Me,"" ""Your Mirror,"" ""For Your Babies,"" ""So Beautiful,"" ""Angel,"" and ""Fairground."" Simply Red like most of the bands of the 1980s had their own sound and style. Love the red hair color on the singer and always wondered if it was natural."
5,Simply Red - Greatest Hits,"This CD is one of my very best CDs; period. An outstanding assortment of outstaanding music from an outstanding artist. If you don't like this CD, you don't have an ear for excellent music. This is a must have album."
3,Simply Strong,"Simply Red is one band I enjoyed in the late 1990's. This collection delivers great pop songs like It's Only Love, and Your Mirror. Although the popularity of the band vanished in the 1990's, Simply Red remains a driving force that people still think of as an '80's band."
5,My favorite powder,"I have been using this powder for the last 20 years. Sadly, it has suddenly been disappearing off the shelves of my local cvs/walgreens/walmart. I now have to seek it out on the internet and that can be a pain sometimes.Any who, this is a great product. Has very smooth finish. I recommend the translucent/no color, allowing your natural coloring to shine through.**a note to the manufacturer- PLEASE PUT IT BACK IN THE STORES**"
5,WAY better than expensive department store powders,"I've used this powder since I was in high school 20 years ago. Recently I cannot find it in my drugstores, so I've found it on line - make sure you do a search for it for the best price. I prefer loose powder for many reasons and the matte, no color, is the most versatile. The translucent has a bit of a sparkle to it and can make you look shiny. This powder is light weight, medium coverage and has an overall smoothing effect, evening out skin tones and large pores. I have combination skin and it works great absorbing extra oil without drying out the rest of my skin. I am a devout Clinique user, but I PREFER CORNSILK for my face powder."
4,Not too bad.,His thesis is far more convoluted than the title would suggest. Still it is relatively readable and not overly complex.
2,Desepcionado,"Despues de seguir la carrera, del poeta urbano, me duele admitir que esta recopilacion de exitos, es de baja calidad. Ojala y no sea que el animal nocturno, puso su fuego de libertad en refrijeradora. De un amigo! eMarco~~{~(@"
4,Pretty Good service,"The book arrived very quickly which I was very happy about. However I thought that I remember the book being classified as ""Like New"". If I were to describe the book it would have been ""Very Used"". But it was only for school, so looks don't ultimately matter. But the service overall was very good."
4,A good book from someone who was there.,"This is a medium to smallish sized war memoir written by a Navy Chaplain who was attached to a section of Marines at the beginning of Gulf War 2. It is well written and relatively easy to read. The conclusion may leave you wanting to ask, ""What happened next?"" Of course, the war is still being waged at this time. I met the author and he is what you would expect of an officer, gentleman, and man of God. I enjoyed it and got another copy for my dad. Enjoy!"
5,Recommend for every one....,"We need to know this stuff. My son was 1/5 on this invasion. It took me four years to be able to read what he went through. He said it was nothing compared to the next two tours but I enjoyed the book, and was glad to know the guys had such a great chaplain. I've bought more copies and am loaning them to friends and family. It's hard to read about Iraq or any war, but Americans should respect and appreciate every freedom we have. VOTE!"
5,"Just Like its Author, A Godsend!!!","As a wife of a former marine of First Battallion Fifth Marines who served during Operation Iraqi Freedom, I can speak from my heart and with complete assurance when I say that Chaplain Carey Cash is a true Godsend. He and his wonderful wife Charity are true blessings from God himself. Carey was not only able to minister to the marines and sailors of 1/5 during his tour with 1/5, but he is now able to further his ministry by reaching out even now through his book to touch even more lives.... as you read the book you may question or think the things he describes couldn't be possible, but all you'd have to do is ask any one of the approximate 1200 marines and sailors of First Battallion Fifth Marines who served in 2003 OIF and they'd be able to tell you of the many,many truly miraculous events that occurred where the hand of God himself was there protecting the men of 1/5. If you've ever questioned ""is there a God?""... this book answers that question..thank you Carey"
3,Bleak tale of the homeless in Seattle,"Poverty Bay is a solid enough mystery wrapped in a depressing ambiance. In this second book in the series, Thomas Black is hired to locate a missing man, Lance. Lance failed to meet his black girlfriend at the marriage license bureau. It turns out that Lance is the sole heir to a 15 million dollar fortune who has lived as a street person for the last few years. Hence, Thomas follows a trail through both the homeless life of Seattle and the black sub-culture as he seeks Lance.This was a pretty good read. The clues, while sometimes pretty improbable, turn up regularly. Still, there's no glamour in this tale or humor."
3,Lots of holes from the very beginning of this one,"Very tiresome reading of this one since it got so many holes from the very beginning without any appropriate logic and explanation. Trying very hard to create a cool p.i. sometimes might only left bad taste for a thinking reader. Gulping up blindly without thinking while reading a detective story would not good for your health, at least not for your brain."
5,I am giving credit to the background soprano on Wimoweh.,"I would like to give credit to the hair-raising background soprano that contributed to the success of the song (Wimoweh) The Lion Sleeps Tonight. Her name is Dolores Boswell a.k.a. Dee Tigue. She is a critically acclaimed, internationally known coloratura soprano. She is my vocal coach, piano teacher and mentor as well. She is a wonderful lady with a heart of gold, and deserves to be given credit for her awesome performance on the Wimoweh track."
4,Hooky Die Hardish sequel...,"I actually really liked Bloodfist IV and V as the stories were decent along with the action, so in turn I had higher expecations for Bloodfist VI. BF VI jus comes off being another hooky Die Hard rip-off with some terrorists breaking into a nuclear missle base and threatening to explode one. Now its up to Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson to stop them. If you found the other B-action entries into this series enjoyable, you might find some enjoyment in this entry. I basically own it to complete my Bloodfist collection."
3,Is it a Belkin or not?,I received this from Amazon in a plain plastic bag. The cable part of it says Belkin but it looks like someone pressed on the ends in their basement.
5,Good cable,"Really hard to say if its better than any other cabe,but seems to work as well as any others and was cheaper."
3,shoes,"they look and feel good, but it's good if you see and try them before you buy. i couldn't guess the size from 2 tries. they seem to run large. you better try them in some store first."
1,Save your money or spend it better elsewhere,"The majority of the entries in this book are for loans, not grants. I think that Mr. Lesko should entitle his books more honestly, such as ingredient labels for foods must be written, with the largest amount first, and in descending order. People would then realize that grants, or other ""free money"" entries, are last on the list.I'm sure there are better, more honest books out there that truly do list a multitude of grants for entrepreneurs -- or for anyone else, for that matter.One thing I will say that I think is great about this book is that there are plenty of educational sources for those who wish to go into business for themselves but have no background or knowledge of it."
2,Obscure Information Overload!,"I've seen ads for Lesko's books for years. When I opened a coffee house and needed some financing, I figured I'd give this book a shot and really find out what was available to me.The book is certainly full of information on loans, grants, government assistance, etc.... unfortunately, only a small fraction of that info pertains to any one particular person. All of the info is broken down by what's available by state and city. Some states have a lot of programs available while others have a few.I live in California and most of the programs listed were either things I had already tried or wasn't eligible for.Unfortunately for me, this book was a waste of money. Fortunately, it wasn't expensive.This book, as advertised is just a one stop place for all that's available. Some of the data wasn't quite up to date, but if you don't want to do any research on the Internet about what's available to you, then this book could be useful."
2,A little more than a directory,"The book has some hints however, it is more of a directory which is outdated."
2,Not impressed,"Would not recommend, i didnt find it very useful, some of the information is very specific and if you do not fit it, its of no use to you."
4,"Pretty good Shampoo, Scent isn't too strong though.","It definitely makes her coat super smooth and airy, I love feeling my dogs coat after I clean her with this shampoo. I wish the scent was a little stronger though, but I guess that's a personal preference."
4,Does the job,"Great shampoo. Both of my dogs had been scratching for several weeks after messing with poison ivy. Used this shampoo and the scratching slowed significantly, Make their hair very soft, too. I would recommend this."
4,"Gentle, Moisturizing Shampoo","Our dog's skin seems better conditioned and moisturized since we've been using this product. Also, it doesn't bother his eyes when I wash his face. Not sure if there's a correlation, but our pup now seems to enjoy bath time!"
3,Go Easy Shampoo,This shampoo has a pleasant scent and seems to lather well and rinse easily. You have to squeeze gentle because it is very thin. I found that I needed to add additional conditioner/detangler to comb through with more ease. Overall it's ok.
2,not as good as the reviews said,"I bought this shampoo because it was reasonably priced and I wanted to see if it really worked as good as the reviews said it would.The product shipped really fast and the packaging was great, which made me happy, but when I used the shampoo on my Pomeranian it didn't really work. While it did leave her coat soft and shiny like some of the reviews boasted it also made her smell really bad like a wet dog. Honestly, I wanted to leave a good review on this product but I can't because while it leaves your dog soft it makes them smell so bad you have to mask the odor with a pet cologne."
5,"Smells good, cleans well!","I have a Golden retriever. Luckily he is not prone to allergies, but purchased this shampoo because I read that it leaves the hair feeling soft. It definitely did that and he smells good too. It lathers and rinses easily. Good product."
2,Well written but overwrought.,"This would have been better as a novella or a short story. Evocatively written, Falconer nevertheless overwhelms the reader with fanciful yet strangely cold prose. The writing is all too clearly the product of intense labour, earnestly wrought, then wrought again and again and again. Clarity and simplicity are abandoned in the pursuit of hyperbole and in the end, the book is as insubstantial as fairy floss. Falconer could do better than this. Good writing should make the heart sing with pleasure at the apt word, the well chosen single phrase. This attenuated whimsy substitutes an infatuation with words for real meaning."
3,Not so exciting,"Having read the actual stories, this is a shadow compared to the orginal; but this is a graphic novel so I guess you can't get too detailed. The art work makes sense compared to manga publications where you can't tell what is going on. Overall, ok if you are browsing for something to ""read"" but it's not a keeper."
2,Fun but fragile,"My 10 year old son really loves this game being able to add characters during battle. I read the instructions and the quality of care this toy requires is not for a ""rowdy"" child or a young one. It is a delicate machine."
3,It's OK,"My kids really wanted, but spend more time on the PS2. I also got the Ben 10 expansion, but think they need a disk? Was not clear when purchased. Honestly, for the money, if Santa didn't bring it, it would go back."
3,Price is good! but its just an ok game,I bought this for my son but he quickly lost interest playing it. The graphics are not that great. I bought an extra controller and the more game packs. This is good for kids 6-8 years old.
1,don't spend any money on a hyperscan,"you will find that most of the positive reviews are from 1) people that have no personal experience with video games and bought it for their young children, or 2) young children. the only reason i can think of is that young children are fascinated with collecting and trading the scan cards. they can't possibly like the game system, as everything about it is horrible. super long load times, repetitive gameplay, and a slow scanning gimmick that becomes a chore very very fast. it is a total failure of a video game system, and underperforms even if considered its own category of entertainment. not worth any price higher than free."
1,even worse than the Virtual Boy,"I bought this system knowing full well how crappy it is. This is nice find for video game collectors, as it will be extinct soon. The games themselves are a real chore to play. The single speed cd-drive makes for constant delays."
1,Avoid this clock!!!,"Let me first say this review has nothing to do with this retailer. This clock is horribly overpriced. Not only that the alarm function didn't work on mine. One might say I got a bad apple, but $150 for an alarm clock made in China!!! That's right, the famous Swiss company makes these in China. I have a Mondaine watch and am completely happy, which is why I took a chance on this one. Don't make the same mistake, unless you don't need the alarm function and are rich. Thank you."
2,Mondaine Train Alarm Clock,Agree with previous reviewer. It's simply a piece of chinese plastic glued into a nice metal case. Broke in a few months. Not swiss by any means.
1,too short,This rosary is very detailed nice gold color that is attractive. Now the down size is that it is so small and thin and 17 lengh around the neck will choke you and makes so short it looks like it belongs only to a small child.If i payed more attention i would not have bought this product is so tight around the so hope you have a skinny neck....................
4,WORDS TO LIVE BY,"The title track, Russians and Americans was a rather passionate call to these people during a most intense moment in history. Rivaled only by Sting's Russians, Stewart's lyrics do not cry out but rather scold: ""Russians and Americans maybe you ought to see into the heart of the world not its head."" Now, my cassette of this album has been long worn away. I haven't heard the album in over ten years! So I may not be as accurate in my quote of the its lyrics. However, the message of the song remains richly intact. Such words to live by!"
1,"AL, WHAT HAPPENED?","We last heard Al three years earlier doing what he did best on ""Indian Summer"". All I can say is that something went wrong or somebody screwed up. Al sounds so....not like Al Stewart of YEAR OF THE CAT, MODERN TIMES or even 24 CARROTS. There are two high points to this album, it is not without slight redemption. ""Accident on 4th Street"" and the title track are worth spinning."
1,"You Should have Listened to Al, Al","Oh my, how depressing. It's been twenty years since I was first shocked by how trendy this cd was. I still wince when I hear the synthesizers, the moronic beat of the drum machine, the thumping bass lines. I'm all for trying new things, but when it comes to following trends just to make money, that's when I say ""enough."" Al Stewart is one of the most talented singer songwriters around, and to hear him - like so many others - try to prove he was hip in the 80's is just plain disheartening. A few of the songs are acoustic-based and therefore not too jarring, but most of this is drudgery to try to listen to. Even the lyrics - always a Stewart strongpoint - are lackluster. Maybe he can do ""Russians and Americans: Naked"" and strip away most of the layers of sheen and fluff. Here's hoping."
3,"O.K., BUT OTHER STEWART ALBUMS ARE FAR BETTER","Although I enjoy almost all of the Al Stewart albums, this one is a little too ""poppy"" for my taste. I think this is because it was released during the 80's (the dancing decade)and it shows. Instead of concentrating on great melodies and lyrics as he normally does, Stewart appears to mostly worry about making rhythmic, danceable music here. However, there are a few good ones in there for the true Stewart fan."
4,Buy this for Cafe Society,This is one of the best songs Al ever wrote! Worth the price of the disc by itself. The guitar and sax just scream. If I want to impress someone with one Al Stewart tune I put this on and crank it up. The rest of the disc is very good to good but maybe a little dated in spots. Buy it for Cafe Society.
5,More twists and turns than a two-lane highway!,"Rosenberg wraps up the ""Not Musketeers"" trilogy in fine style with 'Zenda,' which continues his story of characters at once broadly drawn and yet detailed enough to be endearing. A mixture of one part military/action novel, one part suspense thriller, and one part mystery, Rosenberg also adds just enough political intrigue to satisfy any reader of Clancy or Fleming, though the genre is quite different.Readers of previous entries in the series may see this trilogy as an unwanted departure from the earlier story lines of ""Guardians,"" but they stand alone quite well. 'Zenda' maintains the standard of quality set in the first two, and surpasses them in terms of surprises. Highly recommended to any Rosenberg fan!"
4,"It's Soft-softcore, but fun","Justine's a cute private schoolgirl who's got the hots for her archeology professor, who she often accompanies on his trips. Who cares? Pretty women in sexy situations (not a lot of below the belt detail, though). The acting's bad but that's fixed by turning down the volume. Non-offensive couples viewing."
3,"For those who don't want the complete season 1, 3, & 4(if it gets released).","This DVD collects episodes from seasons 1, 3, & 4.LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER (season 3) 4/13/58 - already on the season 3 set. The Police Chief is murdered & his wife offers a lamb dinner to the investigating detectives.CASE OF MR. PELHAM (season 1) 12/4/55 - already on the season 1 set - Mr. Pelham is slowly being replaced by a double.BANQUO'S CHAIR (season 4) 5/3/59 - new to DVD - Scotland Yard pulls a little hoax to get a suspect to confess to murder.BACK FOR CHRISTMAS (season 1) 3/4/56 - already on the season 1 set - A man, tired of his overbearing wife, plans to get rid of her.Most of these are on these sets:Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season OneAlfred Hitchcock Presents - Season TwoAlfred Hitchcock Presents - Season Three"
5,A Gift To Us From Them,"Grinding guitars,cool vocals and lyrics,a CD that sets you up high with it's power,intelligence, funkiness and emotion. These ladies have it all, I've seen them twice,believe me. Get this music, put on some headphones in a dark room and you will understand too."
3,"Some good, some so-so","In my opinion, Bricks was, and still is, their best! This album is decent, maybe their second best, but doesn't surpass Bricks. ""Freeway"" is a pretty catchy tune with some cool sounding riffs. This song is the closest to Bricks material they've had in years. The other tunes are ok but really don't stick in your head like ""Freeway"". For l7 fans, this is a must album. For others, I'd recommend this CD but would say to go buy Bricks after listening to it to hear L7 at it's best!"
3,Wallenstein - 'Blitzkrieg' (Ohr),"Originally released in 1971, this was their debut. Looks like they put out eventually eight(8) albums. Many site this artist as krautrock, but I thought they were more in the direction of German progressive. Track listing: ""Lunetic"" (11:55), ""The Theme"" (9:37), ""Manhattan Project"" (13:47) and ""Audiences"" (7:38). Each cut serves it purpose decently well. Line-up: Bill Barone - guitar & vocals, Jerry Berkers - bass & vocals, Jurgen Dollase- keyboards & vocals and Harold Grosskopf - drums. Just might appeal to fans of Siddhartha, Eloy, Focus and some Amon Duul II. Enjoy."
1,"A long way from ""K"" Music","PEOPLE!! PEOPLE!! No way is this to be confused with music that has been coined the rather obnoxious term ""Krautrock"". I've worked with one of the founding members of the legendary band CAN, Holger Czukay which was one of the more widely known K bands. This sound is Prog Rock, not in the style of bands like Can, Guru Guru, Kraftwerk, Neu, Amond Duul.... It's crappy Prog Rock ta boot!"
1,Prog not Kraut,"If this is Krautrock then I'll eat my hat. Just being a German band that happened to be around in the early 70's does not make you ""Krautrock"". This is standard issue Prog Rock nonsense, some way short of the British and American progenitors in terms of production and technique - you know, those sort of things prog rock fans set great store by - this is so dated it might need carbon dating. What it is in fact is garbage - listen to the incredibly feeble electric piano on the first track, you'll die laughing..."
4,Looking up at the stars,"Honestly I have no idea if these work. I put in a whole new filter system and the chem-stars are part of it. Using a Filstar xp3.Pros:- They are neat- CheapCons:- Don't come in a pack the right size for an xp3, need to build multiple packs"
5,Fish filter stars,Love these for my tank. We have to have these to keep something in order. Idk. They came with the tank so I renew them when they suggest to. Thanks!
4,"Better than bio-balls, but expensive.","I have a large wet/dry filter that is filled with about 500 stars. I've had it up and running for 12 years now. It's hard to determine how effective these are, compared to other forms of bio-media, without conducting a controlled scientific experiment. My only complaint is the high cost and the fact that after 12 years many of them are starting to breakdown. They slowly turn grey around the edges and break apart."
1,"I could believe, if there was substance!","If you are a true believer of holy scripture, word for word, than this book is for you. I thought this book was going to give me something more regarding alternative sources to draw from. It does have ""some"" sources that were interesting, but not enough for a book. Plain and simple: This book rides on ""You can believe because see, it is written in the Bible""."
4,Markevitch DGG Symphonie Fantastique,"I was happy to find this on Amazon. Yet another Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique to add to my collection! This one arrived very quickly, and was in mint condition. It's in good mono sound, and I've wanted to hear it for a long time. I love Markevitch's conducting, but I was possibly a shade disappointed by him this time; it's the precision and balance that are ""fantastic"" here.This is not as wildly daring and exciting as Markevitch often is, and as I always expect this symphony to be. The Sabbath is a mite subdued. I have a feeling, though, that I'll appreciate this version more as time goes on. It's always interesting to hear a different take on a familiar work. Come to think of it, I'll put it on right now and see how it strikes me on a second go!"
1,Leather Sole Way Too Soft!,"I was looking for quality slippers, no matter the cost. I bought a pair from H.S. Trask for about $150 and used them exclusively indoor. But they didn't last even 3 years, ending up having holes in their leather sole which is way too soft to make it durable. Very unhappy!!!"
4,Not as bad as everyone said....,"I bought this item 1) because I'm a huge Fushigi Yugi fan and 2) I wanted to see if it was as bad as people said. Having read people's reviews before, I had low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! It is different and it can seem a bit convoluted, but if you pay close attention you will be able to find out what's going on quickly and realize where the plot is going. The ending is a bit weak, and Taka is a bit emo, but these little slights can be overlooked. Tasuki undergoes a change but that is because he realizes he has feelings for Miaka and becomes possessed by an evil spirit (he manages to exorcise it with Taka and Miaka's help). And also, alot of people will notice this part of the series is mainly about Taka recovering his memories even though Miaka is still a major part of the plot. Overall, it's still a worthy addition to your Fushigi Yugi collection (even with the minor flaws in it)."
2,Anime,"This wasn't my favorite series. It gets a little long and confusing. Also, some of the characters get really annoying."
2,not as faithful,"while the previous two boxed sets followed the manga faithfully, this ova series did not. i bought it in hopes of it helping me understand the ending (i read the manga in chinese. in the last few scences, the chinese got too complicated for me) the ova series does a really job of making confusing the parts that were perfectly clear in the manga. unless you're really faithful fan or really desparate to find out what happens after (now that u know there is an after), i wouldn't suggest buying it."
3,works but too fat,"the battery does work in my camera and charger (unlike similar products bought in BMS) but is a little too fat/wide. i goes in ok, but is a bit difficult to take out of the camera. the original battery slides out w/o any trouble at all, whereas this one has to be pulled out w considerable difficulty."
5,"Not really a review, just some info .... NOT 1 pound weight?????","I own two of these batteries myself. One apparently just went bad and will not hold a charge anymore.The camera the Konica-Minolta X-50 is amazing and has lasted years and years ... a really good buy,very small and convenient.The batter is just a tad larger than a AA battery ... there is no way this battery weighs one pound, andthe shipping should about $2.00 or so. I wonder why all these shippers are pricing their shippingcosts at almost $5.00 for an item that is very light and non-fragile .. that is, does not require heavyprotective padding or packaging?Maybe there is a reason, but where do they get these weights from, and does Amazon or anyonenot check up on this?The battery itself ... I give 4 1/2 stars for ... they perform very well and charge quickly."
4,Huey's High Point,"The price on this is a little steep, but it's the one must-own album in the Huey Lewis & the News catalog. Say what you will about all the inoffensive, catchy, and forgettable hits these guys churned out in the mid to late 80's. On this album, a collection of covers of 50's and 60's rock standards, they were tight and sharp and in their best form. The recent ""Soulsville"" is along similar lines, but doesn't seem to have quite the same energy as this recording. ""Stagger Lee,"" ""(She's) Some Kind of Wonderful,"" and ""Better to Have and Not Need"" are standouts, but the whole thing is great for lovers of old-fashioned rock 'n' roll."
1,"Great product, horrible seller","The Ben-Nye line is great, but don't buy this product from THIS seller.. look elsewhere. You'll be much better off and save yourself a lot of hassle. IF you even receive the item, more than likely it will something different. Buy this Ben-Nye product, but buy it from another seller."
3,not right away- this is pretty academic,"I purchased this book after a dear cousin committed suicide. I used the Amazon reviews to make my choice from all of the books on suicide that are out there. I have to say, it really didn't do that much for me emotionally. The book is mostly Joiner's defense of his theory of why suicide happens, and hardly at all about what we the survivors can do to get through it. Of course it's helpful to understand the theory, but I think it would have been more helpful down the road of healing, and not right after the fact, when guidance and coping skills would be of greater comfort."
3,A Difficult Read,This book would probably be great for anyone studying the psychology of suicide and is interested in a detailed look at past and current research on the subject. I personally did not find it helpful for someone who is grieving. It reads like a text book.
3,3.5 Stars,"This is not a five star book, it simply lacks the depth and breadth that is required to earn five stars. It does however provide what appears to be a reasonably solid theory of suicide risk.I was surprised that Joiner does not make the connection between his theory and Deci & Ryan's Self-Determination Theory (SDT). I am sure that the author is aware of the connection, so it is surprising that the idea of suicide as de-motivation wasn't explored. I think that factoring SDT into Joiner's existing model would provide a more comprehensive theory.The book would have benefited from tighter editing as it is occasionally repetitive. However there were few actual errors or typos in the text.I have ordered Joiner's ""Myths"" book and look forward to reading it."
4,Sensitive book,I thought this book was very scientific with a very personal side. It was helpful to me as my sister recently committed suicide and I have a medical background to understand his writing. Someone without psychiatric/medical/psychology background might have difficulty with the technical aspects. Plan to pass it on to my family.
4,Wow!,"I saw a bootlegged screener here in L.A. This movie was awsome! Where did they get those babes?!?! I thought the climactic action sequence was really, really good, particulary for a Richard Grieco film -- since he's usually pretty lame.Good directing and acting. Nicely made."
4,Joyce Jimenez is a babe!,"Too bad Joyce Jimenez had to be killed towards the end. Wish there were more scenes of her. She is soooo hot! As far as the movie goes, acting is bad and the body parts story line is old. If you're into the story lines, don't buy this one. But if you're into Joyce Jimenez, this one is a keeper since this is one of the very few American made movies with her in it. Most of her movies are the low budget ones made in the Philippines, which are hard to come by unless you live there."
5,Birkenstock soft footbed,"Very comfortable stylish clog.I've worn Birkenstock clogs for years, and I've never been disaopointed inthe feel,look and comfort. They last for ever."
1,Uncomfortable Clog Drop,A great manufacturer and the world's leader when it comes to clogs. The reason for my poor review is this particular clog features a heel that is lower than the toe. Granted it's probably designed to help your posture but I couldn't get passed the feeling of falling back out of my shoes. You will also realize how flimsy the leather is on these as well. Sent them back.
4,the smallest Birkenstocks,"A well made shoe, with Birkenstock comfort and support. Be advised that if your feet are wide...that is, anything more than a B, these shoes slightly narrower in the midfoot than you might expect from Birks. The real issue, though is sizing. Anyone who is a size 8 1/2 is well aware that because Birks don't come in half sizes...the 38's are usually slightly short and the 39's are always a little roomy. However, if you order a size 39R and expect a roomy fit, forget it. This style is half a size shorter in length. I've tried on several pairs. They're all the same. Short.Just so you know."
2,Squeaky?,"I've worn Birkenstocks for years and love them. After wearing this pair for 30 minutes, both shoes developed an annoying squeak. After the 2nd day of embarrasing squeaks with every step, I'm putting them on the shelf for awhile. I contacted the company and they suggested baby powder or leather conditioner/oil near the straps. I'll give it a try, but right now, I'm just extremely disappointed."
1,bad company,"If you get this item from computer brain BUYER BEWARE. I fought these people for 3 months because they sent me the wrong item and refused to refund me. The product may be good but the company you deal with is a complete nightmare.If you have any problems you can expect to get a serious run around getting anything done. If you get a refund, prepare to fight for it. I got the refund 3 times and each time they recharged for it until my credit card company put a final stop to it and had to actually play escrow company also. I ended up sending the product to discover card company to get my refund.Discover did a great job but Computer Brain is a company I deeply advise against doing any business with. Check out their BBB info and ripoffreports info. It will change your mind in dealing with this company. I am shocked that amazon is working with them knowing thier history."
5,The Perfect Mullet,"There are many mullet wigs out there right now to help 30-somethings relive their high-school days. This one isn't punked up or feathered like some of the more expensive wigs seen at party supply stores. It is inexpensive and has that classic ""stoner"" look ... just what I was looking for. My wig has served me well. I first put it into service for a Halloween party: mullet wig, NASCAR hat, Lynyrd Skynyrd tee-shirt; and my costume was complete."
3,Colorful Doors,"What you see on the cover is basically what you get throughout the book. Colorful, rustic, old doors. Seems like most of the doors are of certain taste or region. Mostly southwestern or old latin american villages. Personally I was looking for a book to give me ideas for interesting, welcoming doors and entryways for more traditional homes in the northeast. This book is not for me."
2,you have to be a practitioner,"There is so much garbage and misunderstanding when intellectuals write something about an spiritual movement. You have to be a practitioner in order to understand fully what Radhasoami is all about. It was a trick/ploy employed by a would be Saviour but it had nothing to do with Bhagwan Krishna and His favorite Radha. Radha in Radhasoami corresponds to the soul of the disciple/initiate. Soami corresponds to the Satguru. Like the Ramasita movement of Ramananda, the teacher of Kabir Sahib, it has nothing to do with Rama and Sita; Rama corresponds to the Guru and Sita corresponds to the soul of the disciple/initiate. It is much easier to understand if one knows the 'Mother and Child Luminosity' of Tibetan Buddhism. I hope that I did not insulted anyone."
2,A Vengeful Deception -- An Appropriate Title,"Never have I had such strong feelings toward a Harlequin romance before. When I finished this book I was so angry I threw it across the room. The premise was great. The characters were well developed and I like Lee Wilkinson's writing style, but the ending was atrocious. Gideon, our leading man, systematically destroys Anna's life. He is seeking revenge for her past crimes. Naturally it's a case of mistaken identity, but when Anna finds out what he has done she all too easily falls back into Gideon's arms. I have a hard time believing Anna, or ANY woman for that matter, would fall back into a mans arms so easily after he has ruined her life. Ms. Wilkinson should have written a few more chapters and really made Gideon work to win Anna back."
4,Maybe the Best of the Three Earthworks Albums,A logical third (and final studio) installment of the original Earthworks. Much better sound than the first album. The tunes are longer with great improvisation on Forget-Me-Not and wonderful composed harmonies from Bates and Ballamy on the last track. Walter Quintus and David Torn did a great job mixing the electronic drums and the acoustic horns. Splashing Out takes house music and turns it sideways in a deliciously twisted jaunt.
3,It's okay but...,"...The Super NES Version is better.Gameplay 2/5-/- It's a little more complicated. not much more to sayMusic 3/5-/- They took out the original stuff [that got a 2 disc soundtrack] and put new stuff in. It's okay and all but, the other stuff is better.Graphics 3/50-/- We all know that Gameboy graphics aren't as good as the SNES, but they did they're best.Overall 3/5-/- eh, I don't like it that much."
3,Wish it would have been better,"I liked this game boy game, but not nearly as much as DKC or DKC2. The game was fun but towards the end, it is almost impossible to win because you have to get EVERY SINGLE COIN to get to the last world. There is no plot, and it is really confusing to get to some of the levels. You definately have to know what you are doing to get to them..... (if you are lucky). It took me a VERY LONG time to figure it all out. It was definately a let-down compared to DKC and DKC2. I wish they would have made it better."
4,someone help,this game was awesome until i got to the boss: squirts showdown. i cant figure out how to suck up water on this level. the elephant tries when i hold b but it wont let me suck any water. someone please post a review with help!
1,Play The Super NES Version instead of the Game Boy Advance Version!,"Ever since I got this game for christmas, It only took me 2 days to beat and the music was not the same as the Super NES version. Ever since I played the Super NES Version it only took me 2 weeks to beat and I was happy about it, But not with this version. plus ever since last year when I got Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros 3 it only took me 3 days to beat. So if you guys want a game for your game boy do not buy this Game!"
5,If you like rancheras you gotta have this!!!,"Esperanza OsunaThis cd has various old and new songs which make it versatil because either young as old people will like to have it. This cd can be used in parties as well as just to remember old times. The songs are beautiful and there are songs you will never forget and will never get bored with. I suggest that if you like rancheras you buy this cd, its a classic, you will not regret it and the money you spend on it will be a good investment you will have various artist in one cd at once. I'm glad I had the opportunity to hear this music, now If you ask me I can seriously tell you that I will not buy any other cd if I want to hear rancheras."
5,Stimulating stories from a different side of Japan,"This collection of magazine articles, translated and re-written in English come from the Mainichi Daily News, who have sourced them from Japan's weekly tabloid magazines. Each article exposes a truth about Japan that most would be surprised to hear. Stories about old age people and their sex lives, schoolgirls and their ""compensated dating,"" or selling their used underwear. About Tax Officials and exclusive hostess clubs, stay at home loners and bored housewives, of corruption, perversion and down right weirdness.This is the real Japan. Not the Japan of Kyoto, Geisha or high-tech, but of real people and their perversions. It is a highly entertaining read.Although now a little dated, they all ring true and are all still happening somewhere in the Land of the Rising Sun."
5,Wonderful Day!,"I am probably not your intented demographic, but spending my Saturday immersed in your book was awesome. It made me ravenous, I drank red wine, laughed with the girls discussing marriage (woof), and even looked @ the man in the mirror ( and my not so perfect exterior ""picture""). Congratulations! Your writing mastery is entertaining and inspiring. Thank you for providing such a wonderful experience."
3,N'klabe are no betting men... they play it safe,"This new group does show that it has potential. The brass is good, and the voices hit at the right times. It will be no secret to those that listen to this album that N'klabe are not only proud of their puertorican heritage, but also display many of the stylistic nuances associated with salsa music from the island.The problem is that it makes them sound somewhat dated. If this same album had come out five years ago I would have rated it one star higher. And what's funny is I also recently bought packete salsera by Tabaco y Ron, a group with a focus for redoing old songs, and found that group more modern, innovative, and willing to take risks.Maybe I am judging them a bit too harshly, and I really doubt any salsa fan will find them lacking. So if you like that good old puertorican salsa, you will like this album. But if you want a little more excitement like me(and I am puertorican), get the Tabaco y Ron CD."
5,!! I LOVE SALSA !!,"The first time I heard of these guys was when they opened for Victor Manuelle at a show that I saw in Miami. They did there thing. They got the crowd going with their vocals and there dance moves. The Groups is up by Hector, Felix, and Ricky. Not only is NKLABE 3 talented singers but their band is made up of a bunch young talented musicians. After I saw the show I had to buy the CD and it's great. The best tracks on the CD are I Love Salsa, Evitare, Quizas, Amor de Una Noche, and Tiempo. This CD has great tracks to dance to and they sound awesome. Check out the CD, you won't be disappointed =) I LOVE SALSA!!!!"
3,Lookout for this Group!,"Finally, a new salsa group worth listening to. I love reggaeton, but you can't forget salsa. These guys remind me a lot of The Adolescent's Orchestra.1.) I Love Salsa (Bangin song)2.) Evitare (my favorite song)6.) Amor de Una Noche7.) Tiempo"
2,music luver,I'm not to happy with this buy the one track on the radio is good however the rest of the album does not have great tracks usually the case when you buy a CD like this one hit wonder still have to inpress me not a must to buy.
1,Good only as a fire starter.,"If you're getting this to help you understand the text book, look else where. This guide expects you to hunt for certain keywords in the text book and fill in the blank. It is formated exactly as the book and it is useless. None of them sample problems in this guide is solved, so you're left with wondering if you did the problems right."
2,"Just ""backup explanations"".","Students and teachers need to know this is NOT a solution manual.This book seems to be superfluous and unnecessary. In fact, if this kind of review is truly necessary, this material should have been put in the book."
1,unplayable,crash all the time cant fly and plains unflyable .shuld be able to use joystick.to many keys needed to play.game to comlacaded!!!! Truth is its a wast of good money.
3,not great,"really small, hard to cook well, won't buy again really prefer the bigger bags, more like poop secret"
4,Good Cold Fun,"I enjoyed reading the Rifles quite a bit. That being said, it was not quite up to par with the Ice Shirt. The plight of the native people of Northern Canada (it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves) is not something one usually reads about. While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the ""great white explorers"" and have little to do with those living there. I enjoy how Vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters, leaving them to become real humans. I will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment."
2,Depends on what you're looking for,"Personally I found this book tiresome, repetitious, self-righteous, incoherent, and boring. What worked well for me in Ice Shirt didn't work at all for me here.I recommend this book for people who are interested in experimental literature for its own sake, who find their entertainment value in reading as an abstract intellectual exercise.If you like the inchoate disconnect of cyberpunk you'll like this, and it's very good for what it is. Just don't expect to be engaged, entertained, informed, or enlightened."
1,Frustrating,"Have to agree with the review of The Ace of Knaves,but can only give this clumsy effort one star. That Kindle does not even list a category as PHILOSOPHY (but lots of trivial pop stuff such as ""Teens"" and ""Romance"" and ""Sports and Outdoors"")is indicative of the adolescent mentality which seems to dominate their editorial staff. That such a central philosophical work is ignored and mishandled is another sign that the ongoing effort to dumb down the American readership is still ongoing."
5,"A wonderful, engaging mother-daughter story packed w/ spirit","First, the writing is brilliant. Rosenfeld is so skillful at capturing the voice of a 12-year-old girl at the edge of the cliff called adolescence, that it feels almost autobiographical. Many readers may feel she is telling their story.Second, the plot is heartwrenching, with the sadness tempered by humor. Readers can't help but root for Justine as they laugh and cry with her. The diary is an ingenious plot device that adds another dimension to the main story.This book brought me back to my own childhood, and I could not put it down even when the tears began to flow. This is a *much* better story than The Center of Everything, which is due out later this summer. I hope word of mouth brings Rosenfeld the audience she so deserves. Go Justine!"
4,"Love the idea, a little disappointed with the coloring","I grew up with The Picture Bible and really enjoyed it as a child. It's a great way for children who might not be quite ready to read the Bible to get a good grasp of the stories. I was delighted to be able to order a copy, but a little disappointed to find that although the artwork is as fantastic as I remember, it looks like they've redone the coloring using a soft brush in Photoshop; consequently almost all the edges of the colors are blurred and run into each other a bit. Maybe it was this way when I was a kid and I've just forgotten, but it's a little distracting for me now."
5,Great Bible for an 8 year old.,Wonderful detailed pictures. He spends long lengths of time pondering the pictures. Very great read for adults to any age children. Accurate text
5,Picture Bible,This picture Bible is written in the comic strip method. It is true to the Bible and does not include any denomination's creed. I have bought several and given them mostly to children about 10 or older. It will be fine for younger children but I feel those above 10 will benefit very much.
4,Excellent Home School Tool,We used an earlier print of this picture bible when we homeschooled our children K-8th. My daughter remembers more details of the Bible (especially O.T.) than I do! Great resource. The pictures help the print and help to differentiate similar events.I was pleased to find that this printing uses a better quality and color of paper than our first Picture Bible.JFR
5,Kids love the Picture Bible,"What a great way to be able to interpet the Bible. My children love this!Not only my children, but parents and grandparents have enjoyed this book."
4,Good for children who don't like to read or adults,"I bought this for myself since I had one as a kid. I learned a lot from it. The author has a few parts where he portrays things as he thinks they happened, but for the most part this is accurate. The pictures aren't the best quality but to me it makes it seem like an old time comic book.I also lent this out to a child (he is about 9 years old) and he really liked it, and then he suggested it to another boy who lent it, and then an other, and so on..."
5,Brings back wonderful memories,"It was over 20 years ago when I discovered this gem as a pre-adolescent and it greatly enhanced my desire for the Word of God. I am currently undergoing a Bible-in-one-year study plan and am currently in the Old Testament. As I go through the Biblical stories of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Ruth, David,etc, my mind is constantly thinking back to the visualizations in the Picture Bible. The Picture Bible made the Word of God palatable for my young mind and accelerated my understanding of its concepts and precepts. My wife is expecting twins and when they come of age, I hope to expose them to this wonderful gift."
4,This is how I still picture Bible characters.,"Throughout our elementary school years, my sister and I did our nightly ""devotions"" using this comic book Bible. Though I'm now 29 years old, I still imagine all the events in the Bible just the way this comic book portrays them.My own young children have been given many Bible story books, but most of them focus only on the cute, feel-good stories such as Noah's ark, baby Moses floating in the reed basket, and baby Jesus in the manger. The Picture Bible, on the other hand, contains a much broader story selection, even some more graphic drawings, such as Goliath being slain by David. (Don't worry, it's not TOO graphic.)There's only one problem with this ""Bible:"" The characters look quite caucasian. The drawings are probably not ethnically accurate."
5,Excellent tool for understanding the Bible,"As a child I picked up the PictureBible one summer day and could not put it down until I finished reading it in the evening. I had read the entire Bible, but was not until I read the PictureBible that I saw the whole ""picture."" I starting reading the PictureBible to my daughter when she was only two. When friends of ours got together for Bible Trivia, my husband and I were winning. I attributed this win to PictureBible and how it is easy to read, understand and accurate. I recommend this book highly to any child or adult."
5,Best Children's Bible,"This is the best Bible for a child... or for an adult who has difficulty reading. It is a comprehensive account of the Bible, compared to others which don't include much of the complete Bible translation. It enables the user to quickly obtain an overview of God's Word. It makes a great gift. I have given this Bible to many people over the years, with great feedback!"
5,The Best Bible for Kids,"If you want your kids to grow up reading the Bible, you can't do better than giving them this picture bible. It really is like a comic book and it will keep their attention glued."
2,Action Bible better than Picture Bible,"This book is excellent, but not as good as a newer edition. The Action Bible is an updated version of the Picture Bible. The text is extremely similar, but the drawings are not. The illustrations in the Action Bible were drawn by Sergio Cariello who has worked for Marvel Comics and DC Comics. I have a copy of both books. The illustrations in the Action Bible are far superior to the Picture Bible. There is no comparision. Buy the Action Bible. It is awesome. My 9 year old daughter will testify to such."
3,Why only white people?,"The content of the book is very good. I just wonder why nearly everyone in the book has peach colored skin and straight stringy hair. The book of revelation says Jesus' hair was as lamb's wool, which is not straight at all!!! Many statues from the ancient world have curly hair designs. I would have enjoyed the book much better if the authors and illustrators took more time to use earth colored people which is a better reflection of all of creation. Great art work, just not very reflective of the multi-colors of human skin which God created."
5,More than excellent !,"I really love this pictrue bible. It is very easy to read and understand. I finished reading it in just 2 days! I just could not help it to read futhrer for I did not realize that the Bible stories could be so intersting in comics!Though I went to a Christian school and got a quite solid training for the scriptures, I often felt frustrated to get into the wordy studies of the Old Testament events.Now, I see the whole picture of the Bible after reading this comic book. When I find something new and exciting in the picture bible, I would return to scriptures for more details.This book is certainly a very helpful tool for all ages to get an overall view of the Bible."
5,Brings the Bible to life for young readers,"My daughter (now 8) wore out the paperback version(at 6), and then we bought her the hardcover(at 7), which I have had to tape up because she reads it so much (and I suspect the binding is not the greatest)."
5,A Great Bible for my 7yr old!,"My daughter started first grade at a private Christian School and was asked to purchase the Picture Bible to keep in class. I searched other vendors and found this vendor through Amazon to offer one of the most reasonable prices for the Delux Hardcover Edition. It arrived in super shape and quickly too. The Bible has beautiful color illistrations for each story. It really is a great book for helping young children understand the Bible stories and not get bored while an adult reads to them. I highly reccommend the ""Picture Bible"" for anyone with young children. Older children, teens, and adults will also enjoy this Bible since it is beautifully illistrated, not cartoonish. The hardcover,delux edition will be a cherished heirloom to pass on to my daughter and her children someday."
2,Wartime Whiffs,"I was disappointed with this book. There isn't enough Sratch'n'Sniff in the book. I think there are a total of 5. I thought every page would have a smell. My boys seem to have read the book, but they too were not happy with the lack of smelly pictures. It's a great idea; kids will enjoy reading books about history with gross stuff, but...it needs more of what it says it is...Smelly Old History!"
2,Concerned,"The fan works, however, when I first start up the computer the fan is a little noisy. I'm concerned about how long the fan will function."
1,No Puck - soft porn pretends to be Shakespeare!,"What a disappointment! I am a great fan of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", and have many different film versions of it. This version sounded like a combination of the classic comedy tale by William S. and a bit of the old naughty. Well, it did have some naughty - simulated sex with a small bit of T and A. But where the Puck was Shakespeare?This type of adult movie is pretty much out-of-date. It is soft porn, or R-rated, with a few OK-looking women topless. The ONLY reference I could find to ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was that Justine SLEPT, and had sexy DREAMS.Plus the movie made no sense. There was no continuity of the various scenes. It was just a crappy script created as an excuse to film naked women."
3,Revision does no service to Nick and Honey,"I was shocked to see that the new revision omits the end of Act II, ""Walpurgisnacht"". George and Honey have a key confrontation. George says ""How to you make your secret little murders stud-boy doesn't know about, hunh? Pills? PILLS? You got a secret supply of pills? Or what? Apple-jelly? WILL POWER?""Several pages are omitted; perhaps Albee wanted to decrease the run-time of the play. I have no idea. The shortening and the omission of key speeches are not worth the addition of the ""F"" word. Honey and Nick become a less complex and nuanced couple; her participation in secrets and her ambivalence about child-birth and motherhood are, essentially, removed from the text.It's an unkind cut."
5,grand American drama...,"If you ever get the chance to see a live production of this classic American drama, run and get your tickets. You will not be disappointed. Edward Albee's drama stands the test of time. George and Martha are in the throes of marriage abyss where the lies, unhappiness and frustration rules the relationship. Theirs is a game not to be played by amateurs, enter Nick and Honey, a young married couple about to get stuck in the web of deceit. The booze flows, the barbs fly and the game is on. This is above all else one of the great dramas of American theatre. I was in a production of this great play a few years back, playing Nick. It was probaly the most challenging play I was ever a part of. To totally divest yourself in it by night's end I was wiped out, emotionally and physically. Awesome experience."
5,The torturous love of a forlorn marriage,"Albee presents with a facade of a very simple play from the start. There are only four characters and the solitary setting is a mere room. As the story unwinds and each character is plunged into the depths of analysis, the game continues. A cruel game is fought incessently and without any rules. Each character is shockingly unique, yet equally essential to the display of inhumane cruelty. Albee is a master of words- his dialogue flows with captivating intensity and unrelenting brilliance. His style is beyond clever- often disturbingly immoral, yet shockingly humane. The rollercoaster ride that he straps the reader to is odorned with the fullness of human emotions- distress, humiliation. love, and hate. I read this play in a single sitting.. and yes my heart was racing until and far beyond the last word."
3,"confusing, and overrated play...","""Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf"" is supposed to be a modern masterpiece, but instead I find a confusing plot, annoyingly minimalistic characterization, and the annoying banter between Geroge and Martha. They may or may not have a son, he may have died recently or a long time ago, and I sort of feel for the boring young couple trapped by these two lunatics. A tired take on those ""Punch and Judy"" plays."
1,This is the most atrocious play ever created,Do anything you can to avoid reading or seeing this play seeing as it is the most horrible thing ever written.It is not a masterful play in the slightest. It is just arguing and yelling. Constantly. It does not come close to exploring the meaning of the American marriage or any other B.S. such as that.It is terrible. Do not buy. Death is better.
1,This is the worst.,"This is the worst,boring book I've ever read. I don't like it at all... and the title doesn't fit to the book. I hate this book."
5,"Sad Story, Witty Dialogue","This play explores the loneliness and desperation of a couple that, like it or not, may typify marriage in our society (well...an extreme example). Although the outcome of the book is heartbreaking, it is honest. In addition to the psycological and sociological aspects of the drama, readers will also appreciate the witty dialogue of the characters. For an intriguing dramatic experience, buy this book."
4,Nothing specially wrong,The product is still o.k. but my personally Thinking about has nothing to do with the product. so i have nothing negativ to say!
5,My introduction to short stories,"My mom gave me this book to read when I was in high school, and I have read every book of hers since."
2,Disappointing stories,"Each of the short stories in VICTORY OVER JAPAN is broken into shorter segments, which makes the book easy to put down. Trouble is, you might not bother to pick it up again.In the first story, 3rd-grader Rhoda chooses as her partner for the war defense paper drive, a classmate who has been bitten by a rabid squirrel. The second story is about a young woman who, unable to find the lover she came to California to join, robs a bookstore and finds adventure. Another story, told by a maid, is of her mistress's revenge on her brother. Unfortunately, all the stories are disjointed, dull and senseless. It's a shame -- this author has done better. Much better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book will only be useful to you if you already know about lattices and complementarity. It will not be useful to you at all if you are trying to learn about them. Most of the proofs are unclear and often are incorrectly referenced. There are also many questionable steps in the proofs as well as some typos. If you can't find anything better to learn from, I guess you have to buy this book. But avoid it if you can."
5,La Bouche? They still are keeping the party going....,"Even after almost 5 years of listening to this cd it is still great. Be My Love is one of my all time favorite club songs. It just makes you want to get up and dance. My 66 year old grandmom even loves La Bouche! I can listen to this whole cd over and over again. Sweet Dreams is also good. Tonight is the Night, I Love to Love, Where Do You Go etc.. they are all great. IF you haven't heard this cd yet, and you love club music or like to dance then check this one out now."
3,Club Ready>>,"This German duo combine synth-pop, house, hip-hop, and funk, all in one package. Sweet soulful female vocals highlight a CD filled with upbeat bass driven club tracks with a few smooth ballads thrown in for GP...Cool Tracks: ""Be My Lover""/""Sweet Dreams""/""I'll Be There""/""Do You Still Need Me""/""I Love To Love."""
4,A brilliant dance CD,"This CD provides a brilliant mix of Dance music, but prefering this style, I am biased towards La Bouche. The Title track ""Sweet Dreams"" and their other hits ""Be my lover"", ""I Love to love"" and ""Tonight is the night"" are by far the better songs. The vocals are superb, and are a credit to Melanie."
2,"Where is ""Fallin' in Love '96 Remix"" ?","Why didn't you release the 1996 U.S. radio remix for ""Fallin in Love?"" It was AMAZING!!! I first heard it on Halloween of 1996. It was played on B96 Chicago in the fall of 1996, reaching #63 for the end-of-year chart (NOT BAD! for only 2 months) But where is the mp3 release?? It is a winner!"
2,Not as good as I recalled it,"Recently I decided to buy a few old techno discs (nothing better than techno to keep you going on the treadmill). Only about four tracks are fit for that in my opinion. I suppose the disc is not so bad, but not to my liking."
4,a book about the loves and evils of growing up,"This book takes you through a young girls tale and growing up and discovering herself. You see how easy it is to hate your family when you're young, and how it's even easier to adopt another one. The beginning is a bit hard to get through with lots of character development, but it's worth it to stick in there. As Paiges life unravels with the woman in the skylark, you start to remember and feel the naivety of being a teenager and the pure guilt and desire you experience when turing into a woman."
3,could have been better,i love Silva's novels but this one lacked something. First the title is wrong for this book..... dont understand why that tile was chosen. secondly after reading his other books you expect as a reader to be given a decent fast paced ending in my mind he missed the mark.Lastly the realationships between Gabriel and Anna and gabriel and christopher were only lightly touched upon in the book. As a reader i wanted more depth.overall the plot was good but the flaws in the novel bring it down to just and average read.
4,All of Daniel Silva's books,I have most of (gabriel allon)books and I like them all very much. I also lend them to my invalid friends and they like them too.
4,Daughter of God's Assassin?,"An excellent read, twists and turns more than the roads leading from Zurich to the Matterhorn.But it seems a bit derivative of another excellent book, Daughter of God by Lewis Perdue: Stolen art, Zurich, Nazis etc."
2,"A rather tedious read with small, infrequent bursts of action","This is my second Daniel Silva reading, having read The Marching Season first. This book spends far too much time and energy on character development and overly-detailed visuals. There's way too much ""atmosphere."" I'm halfway through it, and it is truly trying my patience. I've checked out A Death in Vienna and Prince of Fire from the library, and have better hopes for them. Marching Season was more action-packed than this one..."
5,The further adventures of Gabriel Allon,"The English Assassin is the first in the trilogy of Allon books revolving around events related to the Holocaust. This book provides all the thrills and angst one expects from the series, while informing the reader about the complicity of the Swiss regarding art thefts during the Nazi era. Ironically, the title character is the least interesting character in the novel."
5,Silva's a Five-Star,"I got hooked on Daniel Silva's writing with his latest book - The Secret Servant. I've done a lot of research into the politics and history of the Jewish people, Israel, Europe and the Middle East, and Silva's research is impeccable. His writing, too, is delicious - he has a way of painting a brilliant, detailed visual scene without bogging down his narrative, and that's a gift I wish more writers had. I haven't finished the English Assassin yet, but it delves into some of the most embarrassing truths about even ""neutral"" European nations' involvement in the theft of Jewish treasures during the Nazi era. The historical detail, woven into a tightly paced international thriller, makes for a fascinating read!"
4,"Surprising plot, good characters","Very worthy espionage/thriller. I very much enjoyed this book! I read it in two days. Originally I let it sit on my nightstand for months because I thought it would be another novel about stolen Jewish money stashed by nazis in Swiss bank accounts. But it turned out to be so much more. The assassin angle was not overdone, in fact it was light on details which can bore me anyway. Yet the assassins were interesting characters both. This definitely makes me want to read more Daniel Silva. I also enjoy David Lindsey's writing, and Aaron Elkins writes a good forensic mystery."
4,An Improvement over The Kill Artist,"Art restorer and occasional Israeli spy Gabriel Allon is back. He was introduced in The Kill Artist and it is one of the most interesting characters in recent literature.The English Assassin brings him back in a new; better story and we continue to discover new layers in this complex character. Also, many of the secondaries introduced in Kill Artist are back. The book can be read on it's own, but be advised that it is the beginning of a trilogy dealing with Nazis and the Holocaust. The other two books of the trilogy are ""The Confessor"" and ""A Death in Vienna"". It is advisable; but not necessary to read them in order for better enjoyment and the sake of continuity.If you are looking for a thriller, not too heavy in the action scenes and with a better character development and plot than the average this should be your choice. You will be back to visit with Gabriel Allon."
3,"A good spy, adventure novel","My second Silva novel and certainly not my last. Also, not quite as good as the confessor, this was fun, educational, fast moving...."
3,Wayward narration; Abrupt Ending,Generally Daniel Silva has running prose and descriptive narration. But it looks that this book was written intermittently so the narration is sometimes wayward. The ending is abrupt and not believable and so is the escape of Allon.
4,The English Assassiin,"This is my first Daniel Silva book. I liked his characters, thought it moved along fairly well. Would buy another of his books"
5,Another great Gabriel Allon story,"I have not read all of the Allon books in order, but again I loved this one. It was the first one I have read where Islamic terrorism is not involved, so that made it a little more interesting for a change. I learned a great deal about the German/Swiss relationship during WWII. I would have liked to learn more about the relationship between Anna Rolfe and Gabriel. Overall another outstanding International Spy novel!"
2,Average thriller,"If you like real spy novels like Le Carre or Littel skip this novel. It is fast moving, but very predictable and reads as if it was written for an 8th grade reader. Read only if you want and quick and easy thriller."
3,Audio version,"After having read all of these 4 and 5 stars reviews of the book, I felt a little cheated after having listened to the audio version via Audible (commuter thing), and not having read the book. Maybe this is due to the fact that the only audio version available is abridged. I don't know if the abridgement was poorly done, but the audio adaptation left me feeling that The English Assassin's ending was rushed and brought many unanswered questions. Now I have to wonder what was left out from the full version.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the 6 hours listen. Campbell Scott's narration was very good, clearly distinguishing different characters. I will surely listen to some of Silva's other novels, hopefully unabridged versions."
3,If you like spy novels...,"you'll probably enjoy this book. I found that I actually enjoyed some of Silva's other works a bit more. English Assassin not an earth shattering read, but was enjoyable nonetheless."
5,The English Assasian,Dan Silva's rich writing style and well researched topics are evident in this exciting thriller with protagonist Gabriel Allon.
2,Fooled Again,"I have real hot/cold feelings about Silva's work, either really enjoying (""Unlikely Spy"", ""Kill Artist"") or hating (""The Marching Season"", ""Mark of the Assassin"") each of his books. But I really believed in the potential of the new cast of characters introduced in ""The Kill Artist"", which was a very enjoyable quick read.Unfortunately, the author was unable to keep momentum with this by-the-numbers sequel, where this interesting cast is forced to sleepwalk through the same old throwaway spy novel plot conventions. The entire book feels forced, either by the publisher's desire to pump out a quick follow-up or by the author's zeal to expose what an awful world neighbor Switzerland really is.Whatever the motivation, I found myself sleepwalking through to the end of this one as quickly as possible."
2,Bummer!!,"I've read Silva's later books and they are exceptional, esp. Moscow Rules and The Defector. The earlier books were also excellent, too. This book, however, just died about 3/4 of the way through--and the last chapter??? What the heck???? How'd the Englishman bypass all the security? Why didn't his boss do more than chew him out, and have him killed, for not completing his assignment? What a disappointment.Although this book is a let down, please read his later books. What a difference."
3,The Ending was a Big Disappointment,"Good beginning and was somewhat interesting until the last 70 pages, then it went downhill and stayed there all the way thru the last page. If you like an ending where you can close the book and smile, then this is not the book for you. This was one of his earlier books written in 2002 and I guess he had not yet developed his ability to put it all together as he did inThe Messengerwritten in 2006. It seemed like he was pressed for time and just decided to end it. Certainly not one of his best thrillers, just a mundane spy story."
5,Drawn In to Suspense,Gabriel never fails to impress; just when I think he will not make it back to finish that Bellini but he does but not without a lot of suspense and drama.
3,GOOD BUT NOT HIS BEST,"Daniel Silva is a terrific writer, and I've read nearly every one of his Gabriel Allon books; but I didn't find this to be one of his best.."
3,Very entertaining thriller. Shame about the ending,"I read this book in one day, it was that exciting. Silva is expert at adding atmosphere and history that make him more pleasurable to read than the barely literate Dan Brown and like Brown, his research and sence of history give the book an extra weight.The only disappointment was the ending, without wanting to add any spoliers, I will see that it seems Silva simply ran out of time and patience and just ended it."
4,A Better Than Average Action Novel,"My first Silva book, The English Assasin was recommended by a friend. The concept of an Israeli hit man doubling as an art restorer was intriguing, and the book lived up to my expectations. The story moved quickly, there was plenty of action and at least a little to be learned about Swiss banking and its role in WWII. It was also believable and generally well written. Based on this experience, I am sure I will tackle another Silva offering in the not far distant future."
2,Not That Thrilling,"I expect at least a few edge-of-the-seat moments from this type of book, but there were none. It isn't particularly well-written, there's no engagement with the characters, and the plot just drags."
3,first silva novel,This is an author I hadn't read. It was interesting but far from thrilling. There were too many characters and a great number of very foreign words. This at times made it difficult to follow. I'll read another Silva but probably not a Gabriel Allon.
2,Simplistic,"I bought this book because a talk radio show host said they were awesome and he had the author on his show. I read the reviews and everyone had high marks but I thought the book was a little dimensionally limited in that the story was very simple with no twists and the back stories which were part of the characterizations were somewhat shallow. The book is filled with action and if you like that stuff, this is a good read. I think I am more inclined towards long adventure or historical novels so I may not be the best reviewer of this type of book. Overall, it was ok but I will not get another of these."
5,Fantastic!!!,"This is the second time around that I am reading Daniel Silva's books, the Gabriel Allon series. I can only say that re-reading the books it's just as great as when I read them the first time!"
4,Compelling Historical Novel,Silva writes a gripping novel that also makes a case against the neutrality of Switzerland during WWII. The plot twists around art masterpieces stolen from Jews by the Nazi's and delivered and now kept in Switzerland by rich and powerful Swiss bankers. Silva's intriguing Israeli agent and art restorer Gabrial Allon defies death to uncover the truth and culprits behind the plundering of Jewish homes and galleries by the Nazi's. He uses all of his skills and resources to get to the bottom of the truth and get out alive.
5,another great read,"a great read by Daniel Silva. The best, most filled in characters to date. Really looking forward to reading more in the series."
3,"It's Better Than No Bare at All, I Guess","I recall a pair of sisters, lovely girls without dates, playing ""Shame on Me"" over and over on the jukebox, but Mr. Bare has never emphasized his 1962 successes (including a much underrated ""To Whom It May Concern""). He was playing a small country bar in Chicago just two years later when I saw him doing those songs, medley style, including ""Dear Wastebasket"" and ""I Don't Believe I'll Fall in Love Today"". Not long afterwards came ""Detroit City"" and he was in the big time. Pity that all of the songs here couldn't be the originals (like ""To Whom it May Concern""). Go for the CD that has those originals if you want to be stirred by memories. This isn't it."
1,Absolutely Awful,"Did not sound at all like the original, I have old 45rpms of these and believe me, do not waste your money if you know anything at all about Bobby Bare's singing. This CD sounded like it was recorded from some practice session of a Bobby Bare wantabe."
1,Introduction to Scholarship,"Crammed with jargon and literary psychobabble. If you like postmodernism, Foucault, and woolly, unreadable prose, this book is for you. If not, the dumpster is the perfect place for it."
4,Great Dance Remix,"I brought this CD single just for track # 2.This is a great remix that gets you pumped up. It has abeat that makes you want to hit the floor and sweat.The Dance Floor Anthem mix is about 9 minutes long. However, it goes by quickly since you get caught up in the great vocals and beats.This Remix has Rainbow Club Anthem all over it!"
2,we belong together part 2,this song is pretty basic&I don't get the hype it is getting.it doesn't add nothing to what she has released so far.Her Vocal Runs sound like she has been listening to R.kelly&also some of Usher.the Production is lite&just kinda there.not alot to this song&it's basically We belong together part 2.
2,"Decent, but not great","After being assigned this book for an applied psychology course, we all agreed that it included some pretty basic information but was insufficient in content. This text treats the distinction between basic and applied research in a much too black-and-white fashion, free from the various nuances that actually exist in real applications. Instead, we mostly learned from The Handbook of Applied Cognition (edited by Durso) and found it to be much more adequate and cover each of the chapters from this book and then some. However, this book came with a much greater price tag (around $200).Bottom line: If you want a basic broad brush covering of some topics that you will find in any basic cognitive book, with some sprinklings of application to the real world, then this book is probably sufficient. However, if you are wanting an in-depth coverage of these topics with a wide variety of perspectives from people in applied fields, then you need to seek greener pastures."
1,Q-Link SRT3,"Tried the product for 90 days, felt no difference. Asked to return bracelet, company rep talked me into to trying it for 30 more days. Still no diffrence. Sent bracelet back almost 2 months ago and still no credit. Always the usual answer. Credit will be issued shortly. I would stay away from Q-Link."
5,Very Effective for Several Years,"I began with the basic pendant (the black plastic one), graduated to the silver one, and am now wearing the stainless steel bracelet. I have noticed a major difference in my energy levels since wearing a q-link. I used to find long-distance driving exhausting. I would get out my car light-headed and staggering. With the Q-link I don't have the problem any more. It also reduces my jet lag. Moreover, I don't get tired working on my computer for hours. I have a had very good success with my Q-link and wouldn't be without it."
4,"Great plot, flabby ending","This is a paramount plot, one of a kind for smart guys, where the reader is forced to think deeply in order to medidate about all the offered scattered events so as to understand how the situations unfold and relateCharacters are very well created and developed and some of them relate to RNP other books.As we approach the ending, we expect Judge Masters ruling with total anxiety, however this is solved fast paced in just one chapter leaving a bitter taste after 500 pages of legal wranglingMr. Patterson, if you could made such a great plot you could have worked better not in the outcome but in the way the ending reveals in this book, I did not like it and that is why I take one star away. Next time do a step by step approach instead of letting loose the whole stuff in the nick of time"
4,Paget's personal struggles make plot pop,"Christopher Paget is living a perfectly happy life: he is a successful lawyer with a son who loves him. Then he is called on to defend his son's mother on the charges of murder and to wage a war to keep his family together and his private life private.This book is a courtroom thriller, with the reader turning the pages to find out what happens to Mary Carelli, Christopher's client, former lover and the mother of his son.But what makes the reader care so much is the vibrant, real characters of Christopher and Carlo Paget, and of Terresa Peralta, Chrstopher's co-cousel on the case. These are real people, with real joys and hurts and confusion. As readers, we care about them.At it's apex, the story shows us a man fighting to keep his family and his reality together in a case that is spinning out of control.While the plot and the court action keep our interest, it is the characters and our interest in them that keep the pages turning."
5,Most shocking and suspenseful book yet!,Degree of Guilt is one of Richard North Patterson's best books yet. It keeps you hanging on until the last page........and more!
5,On par with Silent witness,"Degree of Guilt and Silent Witness are Patterson's two best novels, though Turow's Presumed Innocent is the best legal thriller ever written. All better than Grisham."
2,One word: OBVIOUS,"I liked RP's book, Against all Enemies and would HIGHLY recommend it...But I really do NOT recommend this one. There was no suspense, nothing to keep you reading...Have you ever got so bored with a book that you began to skip pages to see if it got any more interesting? That is what I did here!"
2,Read one? Well don't bother with aother.,"Oh dear. I have just discovered RNP......and have discovered that he writes the same book over and over. Half way through my third...I ground to a halt......great beach summer reading but really, why pay for the same book over and over again?"
3,spoiler alert!,The book was well written and a compelling story but the accused was an unsympathetic lying creep who got away with murder. Sure the murder victim was a creep too but he didn't deserve to be killed without consequences.
2,kind of slow,"I was captivated when I read Silent Witness, however this book was not as riveting as the other There were so many details that sometimes was difficult to follow."
2,Not my type,"I found this book boring. The plot developed too slowly and it felt as if Richard North Patterson has/had a lot of ideas which he though would work with the book. The sudden apperance of tapes....Really.....They just appeared out of the blue! He had a good beginning but towards the end it began to drop. The ending just didn't fit with the rest of the book, too warm and happy, I guess."
3,"It's no ""Presumed Innocent""","I found this book hard to get through for a few reasons: I didn't particularly like any of the characters too much. Paget seemed too buttoned-up and stoic to be real, Mary is an all-out frozen witch, and the other female characters were, to a greater or lesser degree, just victims of various sorts. Also the story is incredibly sleazy -- bottom of the barrel, supermarket tabloid stuff. Patterson is a talented writer but this material leaves a lot to be desired. I prefer my mysteries with a little more civility and sophistication."
2,degree of guilt,This book started out with enough mystery to draw you in. I did like the book but felt the relationship of Teri and her husband was not believable and her relationship with Paget was completely predictable
1,"Not only light, but erroneous. Negative stars.","Not only does the author carpet bomb with buzz phrases, he does not understand the difference between classical and Keynesian economics. He cites Keynesianism quite incorrectly, attributing to it concepts from classical and neoclassical economics. Scary to think that colleges pass this blunderation on to students."
2,This would be a great shorter article,This is a good treatment of the rules of the new economy although the author tends to let enthusiasm get in the way of a careful writing style. I wish there were a few less cliches. The rules are changing for internet based providers and therefore for all economic units in society. The author may believe that the rules are changing more rapidly than other observers. I tend to think that Michael Murphy's book on technology based stock analysis covers a lot of the same ground and in a more effective manner.
1,Frictive Thinking Ruins Friction-Free Book,"I was very unimpressed with this book. From the factual errors about what particular companies do, to the report of rumour as fact (e.g., the author's suggesting that a legendary story about a guy in Hawaii selling 250,000 to an A-Limerick-A-Day services for $1 a year -- which the author says he doesn't know is true -- proves his theories about the electronic economy), and his repeated references to John Maynard Keynes as *Maynard Keynes*, Lewis repeatedly demonstrated that he didn't know his subject and had not done research. Instead he seems to rely on platitudes dispensed during consulting gigs. The book starts going downhill from the beginning. A definite don't read. I give it a ""2"" for the attractive cover design, not what's between those covers."
1,Author plagiarized content,"I was quoted in the book - yet I've never talked to the author. What he quoted was misquoted and to say the least, he took serious liberties. He lifted everything myself and a coworker said from a San Jose Mercury Newspaper article about the opening of an In-N-Out Burger, nowhere does he credit the Mercury News. What he plagiarized was twisted for his own use and not accurate to the newspaper article. He goes as far as to imply that I was standing in line with him and sitting with him eating a burger and having a chat with him. What a crock - I wasn't even in the same place he claims he is at.I have not read the rest of his book. Knowing he plagiarized the Mercury News with zero credit, twisted those quotes and implied he and I knew each other in the space of a paragraph and a half convinced me I have no reason to read this book. In my opinion the author was out to make a fast buck by regurgitating other people's work. In a nutshell this is grammatical vomit."
5,Insights from a high-tech grifter,"A high-tech grifter presents a half baked collection of buzzwords, techno babble, and plausible sounding nonsense. Its AWESOME!"
5,"SUPERB! A must-have! More practical than ""the bat""","Based on the TOC, I've been anxiously awaiting this book (so I can figure out a bunch of sendmail problems I have). Well, it's even better than I anticipated! The initial chapters on concepts are clear; the discussion of the .cf is very useful & complete. In the real world env., I suspect this might even supplant the ""bat"" book! (agree? comments?)"
3,Very Scary,"A vigilante film of only medium level quality, despite the presence of the renowned and impressive Michael Caine. Actually, Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood have done this type of role in much more effective ways in the past. Nonetheless, the theme of justified revenge is always an appealing one (even to those who won't admit it), and there is enough entertainment value in this film to warrant it's purchase (when it comes out on Region I DVD). The presence of very scary looking amoral criminals definitely gives added value."
2,Caine Lone Saving Grace In Dismal Vigilante Film,"""Harry Brown"" is the worst kind of movie. It's not very good and it's not truly bad enough to be memorable. It encapsulates the mediocrity of a fast food meal. This vigilante tale wallows in the predicatable and the villains are cliched. It's not boring but a sense of ennui permeates your subconscious as you watch the events unfold. Michael Caine as the title character, a retired Royal Marine who takes a stand against the marauders of his housing estate, breathes life into this inert exercise. What was he thinking when he took on this project? Was he thinking that he was doing a British redux of ""Gran Torino""? Alas, what he is left with are the sad sequels to ""Death Wish"". Caine would make reading the phone book interesting and darned if ""Harry Brown"" isn't the cinematic equivalent of that."
2,Death Wish (very light),This movie was overhyped and overrated. Despite the superb acting by the renoun Michael Caine I thought the movie was quite dull and boring. The storyline was silly and the screenplay was not well written and didn't make sense with the events that transpired like why was the victim being targeted in the first place? The pace was plodding and there was very little action which made it overall a big disapointment.
2,"Good Caine, Routine Crime Drama","It is a routine film about an old pensioner dusted off his old gunto revenge his old mate's brutal death.If you are interested in gritty social drama about troubled familiesliving in low-income housing estate in UK, watch Andrea Arnold'sRed Road or Fish Tank.The only redeeming value in this film is Michael Caine."
3,dvd,Was ok but not as good as I was expecting. Arrived before the date giving.packaging was good. Would hav liked to hav seen a little more action in the movie.
2,Clint Eastwood on qualuudes.,"Imagine Clint on qualuudes. You will have it then.Okay movie. Caine is great as usual. The female detective is good. The rest is not very good cliche. This movie is slow. As in real SLOW. Not bad what is there, you just think it takes forever for anything to happen, and when it does it doesn't amount to much.Simply, don't waste your time. There is more to life than this dribble. Even staring at a wall or looking out a window. Go out in the evening and stare at the night sky, much more interesting and enjoyable."
5,Worth the wait,"No synopsis or noteworthy review here - just my recommendation that you watch the film. I've been waiting for months to see it - mostly because Michael Cain has never disappointed me. It was worth the wait. This story was emotionally gut wrenching and the violence was brutal, but the saddest part was that this the reality that too many people are living with throughout the world. I don't need to drive more than 20 minutes away from my little farm town to find a neighborhood that is overcome with drugs, rape, murder, gangs and a total disregard for innocent bystanders and law enforcement."
3,"DANIEL BARBER, OPUS ONE","Vigilante movie. I'm not usually fond of this kind of films that demand some psychological maturity in order not to be misunderstood. This being so, Michael Caine's character is well observed and credible and I really had the feeling to be immersed for two hours in this neighborhood. Recommended to tolerant movie lovers. Only."
3,Good acting-Death Wish remake,"Michael Cane is always compelling. That is the main reason for watching. The vigilante plot is predictable but enjoyable. I really like lone wolf justice dating way back to ""Billy Jack"". Fun to watch, shallow characters."
1,The Worst Movie. Ever.,"Horrible, horrible movie. If you like watching Michael Caine bumble around like Mr. Magoo (with guns and drug dealers and ""hoodies"" - oh, my) then watching him cry, A LOT (in his living room, in the shower, on the street), you should own this movie. Otherwise you should buy it only to burn it. What was Michael Caine thinking??"
4,exciting movie,Very exciting look at gangs drugs and how they can affect retired people. How these kids have nothing to do but to try to hurt people for drugs.
4,An old man's vengeance,"This makes me think of Gran Turino. The stories and characters are very different, but the feel is comparable. Both leading characters were old men angry and disgusted with escalating violence in their neighborhood.Harry Brown gets raw, but it is well-deserved. I certainly wouldn't mind if more people like him took matters in their hands, gangsters and punks are getting away with too much nowadays. :|"
4,You Will Go Blind Reading The Opening Credits - Excellent Film,"Michael Caine's Harry Brown is a retired Special Forces soldier living a quiet life in a London apartment. His life is changed when one of his last few living friends is brutally murdered shortly after his ailing wife dies. He becomes a soft-spoken vigilante, hunting down the gang that killed his friend and is terrorizing his nieghborhood.This is a great movie, and Michael Caine is perfect as Harry Brown. It is surprisingly violent for a British crime drama, but the story, the acting and the subdued pacing of this film make it a must-see.Buy if you must, but Harr Brown is a very positive movie-watching experience."
4,Surprising--Did Not Disappoint,"I got this on a whim because Michael Caine is one of my top three serious actors along with Alec Guinness and Anthony Hopkins, and my assumption was that he would not stoop to a simple Death Wish kind of film. This is a uniquely British film that melds themes well-described by other reviewers.My primary purpose here is to flag this at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog as one of 117 DVDs for smart people that don't like run of the mill movies. This is worth watching and the ending is especially surprising and alone worth the wait.A few other crime-related action films I recommend:From Paris with LoveBrooklyn's FinestRighteous KillThe Departed (Widescreen Edition)Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)Human Target: The Complete First SeasonFive Minutes of HeavenBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New OrleansThe Limits of ControlTwisted (Special Collector's Edition)"
3,Oops! An Amazon error,"Amazon has listed the action film ""Harry Brown"" starring Michael Caine as the chess instructional video by Harry Brown the chess player and teacher. I haven't seen the instructional video but the action film is pretty good. Michael Caine is a former Royal Marine turned vigilante in a crime ridden neighborhood."
4,Vengeance requires patience and maturity,Brutal vengeance tale with heart set in the dystopian present. This really shows why vengeance is not a young person's game; it requires patience and maturity.
3,Dark but interesting,"This is a very tense tale, one where the good guys rarely win and get hurt a lot. But it's an interesting take on a lot of things, particularly the supernatural. The author puts forth the questions without getting soppy."
5,Perfect summer reading. Takes the heat out of your 'summer'.,"I don't want this book to end! But you'll not be able to keep it out of your hands. Krueger's IRON LAKE takes you to a virtual reality blizzard in Aurora; his own Wobegone on the edge of the virtual wilderness. If you've visited Minnesota, get the book!"
4,A must-read suspense novel,"William Kent Krueger has the unusual capability to create a suspense novel that will satisfy all of your senses. You don't simply read this novel -- you feel, tastes, and hear the characters and the suspense in Iron Lake. It's a great read, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next Cork O'Connor mystery."
4,Very surprised,"I started this book several months ago and did not get past the prologue. I had just finished a very good but intense book at that time and in retrospect was not ready for another one. I am glad I gave this book a second chance. Krueger weaves a great tale of suspense and intrigue. I had some ideas as to what was going on and who the bad guys were, but did get some fun surprises. If you have not read this book, then stop here. I was very sad that he killed off Molly, or appeared too anyway. I have not read his next book yet but read the blurb in the back of Iron Lake and am hoping that Molly survived. I am sure she did not but I thought that would have been a good avenue to pursue. His interactions between his characters are very real and the reactions he has them portray are realistic and emotional. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
1,Dissapointing,This is the first book I read by Mr. Krueger and after a superb start I had to abandon it a third of the way through. He has all the potential to be amongst the best but find that he gets eternally bogged down in details that have nothing to do with the novel. On the one hand he goes on an on about Native American politics but what I found most unnerving was an endless digression when the main character finds out his wife is cheating on him - really has nothing to do with the core story yet the author prattles endlessly about his self pity and immature behavior. If I was interested in reading about a silly man's pouting about his wife's infidelity I would go to the romance section!
4,Good read,"Kept me interested and wanting to continue on...First time reading this author, I finished this and purchased 2 more of his books."
4,A compelling thriller set in the iron range of Minnesota.,"If you like James Lee Burke and Tony Hillerman, you will find ""Iron Lake"" to your liking. Deeply intricate plot, good local color, plot twists and good characterization. Add Cork O'Connor to your list of favorite characters along side of Dave Robichaux, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn."
3,A little Predictable,"This is first in the Corcoran O'Connor series. Since I've read some of the books out of order, I was a little confused or bewildered about how things are different in Cork's life. A good read, good character twists, a little predictable at times which kept it from getting more stars. If you like Hillerman mysteries, you should like this series also."
2,Iron Lake- OK but kinda rusty,"The book was OK but long... it needed editing and the characters seemed predictable and shallow- especially Jo and the native American references seem contrived. Krueger would do well to got to school on Hillerman's work. At the end I ended up flipping pages to get through seemingly endless verbiage. But as it's Krueger's first and I've not read his subsequent work, I'll give him another try. For me, this is a book better checked out from the library than purchased. Others will disagree."
4,Iron Lake takes Iron Man,"I feel as though Krueger's hero, Cork, has nine lives. He seems impervious to many things that would bring other men to their knees. Perhaps his connection to the Indian tribes in the region gives him this extra power, but I felt he was a bit too superhuman for my taste. It's a good read, but not great. Good escapist fiction for sure."
4,A good mystery...,"It's my first read from author Cork O'Connor. He will be added to my list of mystery authors who I enjoy such as Robert Crais, Jonathan Kellerman, Lisa Gardner, James Coben, Michael Connelly, Michael Prescott, Linda Castillo, Jeffery Deaver, Karin Slaughter, Tess Gerritsen, John Lescroart."
5,Stunning Mystery!,"The author wrote a beautiful mystery set in the chill of winter and the warmth of the Christmas season. With great characters and a plot that never stops, this story should be read by everyone that loves a great mystery!"
3,Good start in an obviously projected series.,"Good characters, especially the hero Cork O'Connor. Plot moves along quickly with a few surprises, though pretty much a predictable solution. A great change of pace to have a setting for a crime novel in an area other than NYC or LA."
2,A bit too much conditioning,"I've noticed my dog Max gets dirty faster when I use this. He has very fine hair, so maybe that's why. I finally went back to using a shampoo/conditioner product.Maybe it works better on some dogs than others."
2,"Synergy Groomer's Blend Oatmeal Protein Conditioner, 17.3 Ounce",if you want to treat your dog with chemical this is what you need does its job but its all chemical
5,Helps with tangles & scratching...,"Our vet recommended oatmeal shampoo because our shih-tzu always scratched after his baths. It worked...he stopped scratching when we started using Groomer's Blend Oatmeal Protein Shampoo and the Groomer's Blend Oatmeal Conditioner; we also stopped blowing his hair dry. According to a book I recently purchased on Amazon,Everything Dog Grooming Book: All you need to help your pet look and feel great! (Everything Series), dog shampoo and conditioner can be diluted 1/2 with water. That's what I did for my shih-tzu's last bath and his hair came out silky smooth & he didn't itch.This conditioner is not overly perfumey & doesn't leave much of a scent on my dog's hair."
4,Good moisturizing conditioner,"I use this condiitoner in conjunction with other products by Synergy Labs. After rinsing out her shampoo I put this on her fur and give her a nice massage. This gives the conditioner time to work. After rinsing, drying, brushing out, etc. you can really feel the difference. This product makes my poochons fur sooooo soft and she smells great too! It has really helped with her itching. It is dry where we live and the moisturizer really helps her skin.This is another Groomer's Blend product I would highly recommend."
4,TESTED BY A MALTESE,"REALLY WORKS GREAT, KEEPING TANGLES OUT LONGER.........REALLY IMPORTANT ON A LONG HAIRED DOG.THE SHAMPOO FOR WHITENING WHITE BREEDS REALLY WORKS TOO"
5,loyal customer,"I m tryed to different one before , so far the Synergy groomer is the best ....try one time for dog ...and u know what I mean"
4,Smells good!,"I think this does what it's supposed to do; however, you have to use a lot each time to get it evenly on your dog's coat so a bottle will not last that long if you bathe weekly like I do. The smell is nice and makes my dog's coat very soft."
5,Nice!,"This conditioner smells GREAT and it makes my akita's fur nice and soft!!!! In the winter, when I take him to the groomer's, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner (both ordered from here on Amazon) instead of having them use their own."
2,Too general for my tastes,"All the information that is pertinent within this book can be found online, including the diagrams in the index. If you want a translation of a historic document then it is a fine purchase. I was hoping for something more detailed than the rudimentary description which this book provides."
1,"Scanned book, low quality print","Those guys didn't even bother to re-edit the book, they simply scanned it so it has all the spots and imperfections of the old edition (which is REALLY OLD). For whatever lousy job they did(n't), the book is heavily over-priced."
4,Brad Whitford lays it out!,"This is a great cd! Too bad they issued only 58 minutes on this pressing. Perhaps in a second printing we'll get 80 minutes. Still a great show! These guys ""can still kick it out"". Makes me wonder why they issued a 2002 show in 2005? Since this is indeed the case, why not go back through the Aero Archives and offer the longtime fans some juicy shows from the 1970's, kinda like what The Allman Brothers and The Grateful dead are doing. Having said this, Brad Whitford is great both on rhythm and lead here, as the two guitarists interchange solos. Joe Perry is great, but he is outshone on this particular night. Maybe that's why they retreived this 2002 performance? 5 stars if Aerosmith issued 80 minutes on a disc. Only one power ballad on this cd - which is good. ""AeroRock""."
4,Almost a great CD,"I would have given this a 5 star rating but I cannot stand the Just Push Play songs and I Don't Want to Miss a Thing. This album is also missing song selections from the best Aerosmith album of all time...Rocks. Get rid of Miss a Thing and add Rats in the Cellar, Back in the Saddle, or Nobody's Fault. Or how about Sick as a Dog? Get rid of the Just Push Play songs and add in some Rocks and this album would have been a masterpiece.But I am happy to see some of the other rare songs like Seasons of Wither and No More No More. But this album is in bad need of some Rocks."
3,"Not there best, but I won't send it back.",Good to have in your collection. I have others and this is one my 3rd favorite DVD of Aero. live.
3,"Good Album, Recommended","I'm a hardcore fan of JP & Aero. I like ALL JP's solo albums including this one. I'm a bit disappointed by the mediocre lyrics. The Guitar part is excellent to say the less and it makes this an excellent album. JP is NOT a singer ( but...he's one of the best guitar players ever) and it shows, nevertheless I would recommend this album to anyone, the guitar work is VERY GOOD. The album as a whole is not as good as I expected it to be but it's not a complete disappointment as some reviewers state."
2,WHAT A YAWN,"Like the new live Queen and Cream packages, this too comes across as a MONEY thing...a big stinky business deal. In the case of Areosmith, it's play the old covers for the ""old"" fans. Yuck! Maybe, I'd feel different if this was to promote something new or original, but it's all just nostalgia-marketing.But my other favorite ""classic rock"" band Deep Purple, do have a new album, ""Rapture of the Deep"" and it truly kicks arse! Live ""in studio"" recordings from a band on fire. With a new album of NEW material selling close to a million copies worldwide already, ""Rapture of the Deep"" is one of the finest albums of 2005. Bravo DP!Now wake up Areosmith and start making some relevant music please.What will sadden me is that the media will promote this recycled rubbish from Areosmith, Cream and Queen, but completely ignore the innovative and NEW Deep Purple album. Go figure. Talk about the state of the ""art"""
5,Fabulous Paper Dolls,"Tomer Heymann's documentary Paper Dolls is fabulous! Entertaining and moving at the same time, thoughtful, political and intimate. The film follows the filmmaker as he learns more about the Dolls, and his affection for them is palpable. The film is hilarious, but also touches on the legal, political, religious and social challenges faced by the Dolls. I adore the Dolls, and I adore this film."
2,A disappointment!,I found this work to be a superficial treatment of a very complex topic. The study of Muslims in the West has been studied in great detail by Dr. Sami Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh. This work pales by comparison.
4,"A fair examination of Walt Disney, the man","Mosley presents Walt Disney's life story in a fair, human (foibles and all) account of the man behind the corporate icon. Filled with detailed personal accounts of Walt's involvement with various productions.I have no problem with this ""unofficial"" biography, one which portrays a less-than-stellar account of Disney's attitudes, while giving full credit for his creative achievements, but I tend to question Mosley's tendency to parphrase conversations and qoute them as verbatim. More explicit citings of his sources (who told him what stories) would lend more credence to Mosley's ""story-telling"" narrative."
4,Informative.,"I found ""Disney's World: A Biography"" very informative. New little known facts that I did not know. Leonard Mosley humanized Walt Disney, which isn't bad. Did not change my opinion of the great Walt Disney at all. His legacy will always be with us. A great man."
5,A Treasure,I saw Mr. Woodson in a stage play a few years back and heard him sing. His voice gave me 'chills'. He was a gifted man. This album does the same thing. It is a beautiful remembrance of Ollie Woodson you will treasure forever.
3,to be continued....,"for a debut album,underwhelming... as i respect/admire ollie as the ONLY worthy successor to the inimitable david ruffin, whom i knew, worked with and admired, with the exception of carole king's "" will you still love me tommorrow "", this endeavor did not showcase his extraordinary vocal/arranging/producing abilities... his "" drama in the bedroom "", a very inventive resurrection of the floater's "" float on "" was amusing and, i admit, entertaining, but... i think i can speak for all temptation/woodson afficianados, we were expecting so much more.... ollie, take a little more time, secure a few more investors ( if necessary ) and do it like you know it should be done - the "" sweet muffin "" would want it that way ... and by the way, dedicate one to him - you owe it to him... and.. he'd appreciate it..."
4,media version,"I would like to find out if you have a CD-ROM or on-line of the newest version ""Principles of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology""?Thank you in advance for your response."
5,As described and On Time,"This item is pretty basic,but everything was as described, and good package. No more to say, very good service."
5,Wonderful historical reference for the Bill of Rights,"Well written and interesting. This book gives a wonderful historical perspective of the laws, practices, and history that led up to the framing of the Bill of Rights. With careful study, Levy has built a window into the politics, thoughts, and fears that led to the inclusion of the BOR and includes many examples of the reasons that they were included. Well written and entertaining, this lesson in American history reads like series of short stories."
3,Not a classic lozenge,"After three weeks in which I caught and recovered from three colds, I was looking for a generic version ofCold-Eezezinc lozenges, and saw these. These aren't the same thing, even though they have many of the same ingredients. Cold-Eeze comes in individually wrapped lozenges, which are like cough drops or hard candies. You suck on them for 20-30 minutes, and they coat the throat with zinc gluconate glycine. This has been clinically shown to prevent and reduce the severity of colds. These Sunkist lozenges are more like breath mints than cough drops. They look and feel like Alka-Seltzer tablets, they are not individually wrapped, and they dissolve in your mouth in half the time. That said, I've taken them in the same situations as I take Cold-Eeze, i.e., when I feel a cold coming on, and the colds haven't materialized."
2,Buy the Author's other book...more bang for your buck,"If you enjoy Persian cuisine, you should buy Najmieh Batmaglij's other book called ""New Food of Life"" it has all of the recipes of this book and MORE. I've had the ""New Food of Life"" for 8+ years and its one book I use A LOT. Her measurements and explanations are great and easy to understand in both books. Enjoy or as Batmaglij ends her recipes Nush-e Jan!"
3,expiration date too short... but still good,it was good but the expiration date is way too short i still think it could be mabey a half a year or a full year but it was only 2 months!i also bought the cheese and breadsticks those were only 1 and a half month date! very disappointed with the expiration date if you plan on getting this or any other handi-snacks brand dont expect it to last more than 2 months!
5,perfect treat for after school,"I thought this would be a great idea for having in the treat drawer for the kids after school. Little did I know that the grown-ups would enjoy them just as much! And mommy (me),maybe even more than the kids. perfect sweet fix when I'm stressed! I got the subscribe & save price, so it ended up being a better buy than getting these at the local grocery store. And free 2day shipping on top of that....I have no complaints! Great job, Kraft! They're a hit!!"
4,Decent snack,"well, here's what happens when you mix Handi-Snacks and Oreo - you get a snack that is actually pretty tasty and fun to eat!"
4,Good product...not sure if dishWasher safe,This is a good food container...keeps the food for 5 hrs.But the product dishwasher does NOT mention whether it's dishwasher safe or not..
4,"yep, the bureaucrats can do something right!","I used an earlier edition of this excellent book while I was learning to fly the Piper Cub. I found it very helpful, especially when I was sitting down in the evening and trying to figure out what I'd been doing wrong that morning (or less often, what I'd done right). I was using Wolfgang Langeweisch's fabled ""Stick and Rudder"" at the same time and for the same purpose, and believe me, the FAA did it better! I found it especially helpful when it came to grasping the ideas of pattern work, final approach, and short-field and soft-field takeoffs and landings. I recommend it highly to the new student pilot."
5,"HTML Goodies, 2nd Edition, by Joe Burns.","Ms. LeeJai Cook, Roaring Springs TEXAS USA.The book arrived promptly and in very good condition. I like the format he uses to present the information. Thus far, his instructions are very understandable. His book contains an enormous amount of useful information.I am very pleased with the book."
3,"Good Source, needs to be updated","I ordered this book for a online course that I am taking. The tips, and codes are good, and the author knows his stuff. It just needs to be brought into the Window's XP, Vista, and 7 age. It stills talks Windows 98. I would recommend this book if learning for the first time about creating Web Pages. You always need some HTML."
3,Good for Beginner only,This is a great book for beginners but not for specialized or advanced html stuff.I found this book too simple for me. So it's in the junk pile. There are better books on Amazon than this one for advance stuff.Will
3,"OK, but not a great place to start","This book has quite a bit of information although I would not recommend this as a beginners guide.I did find a few flaws in the book which became quite troublesome whereas I had to refer elsewhere. I had to look elsewhere for a few other things as well.Don't get me wrong, the book is informative and Mr. Burns has a way of speaking as if you were having a one on one conversation. If you know what you are doing, this book is pretty good to have on hand. There is a nice section of resources, a very handy color chart, some pictures and a few helpful sections of HTML.As an intermediate, I refer to it often, but do not like it as a tutorial. There is also too much referencing for the reader to go to the website. Speaking for myself, I am not ""always"" on-line to see what was supposed to be explained in the book.In conclusion, I do not mean to imply this book is not worthy. Just not for a beginner."
1,It's a Shame They Killed Trees to Print This,"This is one of the worst books I have ever bought. It is utterly useless along with the JavaScript Goodies book. I hope they used recycled paper on both of them, because they were both horrible."
4,This can be a helpful book,"This book is full of HTML tips and hints, but you can find the same tutorials at the website of the same name. This book is a great thing to have sitting next to you when you're working on a website, because it will help you understand what kind of HTML to use and when. Of course, it also stresses that you shouldn't over do it with different kind of HTML goodies, because that can create annoying website.This book is definitely a must-have for those of us who like to sit around and make websites."
4,Very good HTML tutorial and reference. Covers java and cgi.,"Joe Burns has an excellent teaching style and writes well but the book suffers from little or no editing. The politically correct writing style is very distracting and should not be used in tex books. HTML, java script, java, forms, cgi is all there with clear explanations and clarifying detail. It aslo includes many examples and frequently references his teaching website. A very good book, well worth the money!"
5,This man knows how to communicate & teach !,"Thanks Joe. Within 1 hour after cracking your book and using your website I was cranking out honest to goodness HTML code that WORKED. My brand new 12 page site is up and running perfectly thanks to you. You have the obvious gifts of being able to communicate and teach. Your answers to FAQs in your book/website closely paralleled my own questions. I wish more people knew their first website was no more than 8-10 hours of pleasureable coding away. Thanks again for a superior product and please take good care. By the way, when is ""JavaGoodies"" scheduled for publication ? ;)"
5,"The best plain english ""how to"" books on site design ever!","I cannot say enough about this Joe Burns books. I discovered his website back in the 90's and the book -- HTML Goodies -- came soon thereafter. I am a person who has no formal training in website design, computers, anything technical. With Dr. Burns' tutorials, I learned html, website design, adding graphics, javascript, getting my site online, and everything else I needed to know to design and get my (20+ page) business website active and making money. The best part of all is that Dr. Burns' books and tutorials are written in PLAIN ENGLISH -- no tech degree needed to understand them. If you use this book to learn html, you'll never use any of the quicky code writing software kits. I highly recommend this book, as well as Dr. Burns' books: Beyond HTML Goodies and Javascript Goodies. You'll find these books are worth far more than their current price."
5,This book is second only to having the teacher at your side.,"A clear presentation of web page design especially suited to beginners (not that intermediates wouldn't benefit, too). Joe Burns writes in an easily understood manner, the chapters follow a logical progression, and point you to on-line tutorials to help with practice and understanding.I reviewed a number of books on basic web page design and maintenance. This is by far the easiest to follow. No particular programs are ""pushed"", no disks are attached. You won't need them.Great book! Thanks, Joe, from someone who didn't know where to begin."
1,"This is the best band in the world. However, do not start with this album.","I love industrial, and Skinny Puppy is my favorite band. I love experimental music, noise, etc...including the song ""Download"" by Skinny Puppy. However, I'm sorry to say, this jam with Throbbing Gristle is a bunch of boring racket. Not everything Puppy touches turns to gold. There needs to be more sweeping synths and ambience to break up the static-y parts. It's all about dynamics, and this is nearly 40 minutes of static. Listen for yourself."
1,Boring,"This ""jam session"" that SP and TG put togother some time ago is only notable since these two bands are so drasticaly different, as well as being notable pioneers in the world of electronic/industrial music. Other than that, Puppy Gristle does not do much to really elevate the listner. Featuring about 45+ minutes of boring synthasizer manipulations and OgRe wailing ala Spham Dirge, this is a track that only a hardcore Puppy fan will love. It comes off as pretentious, boring and cumbersome, rather than being interesting and finding 'new bounds in the realm of electronic music'. Do not buy this unless you are trying to complete your Skinny Puppy collection."
4,Carpenters As Time Goes By,"This is a very good CD, but the music isn't quite what I expected. Only for a very true Carpenters fan."
2,"a few interesting moments,but not a classic","""as time goes by"" has a few interesting moments,but overall this album could best be described as a sampler of the approximately 7 albums worth of unreleased tracks sitting in the A & M vaults up to this point.listening to this album just once,it is easy to realize that most of these tracks were not designed for a studio album.Comprised mostly of duets,medleys and instrumental tracks,the highlights on this release would undoubtably be the jazz standards karen recorded for MUSIC,MUSIC,MUSIC- my funny valentine,someone to watch over me,as time goes by.unfortunately,only small portions of these songs were recorded in a short medley with ella fitzgerald.it would have been great if karen continued in this jazz format,instead of returning to pop for her lackluster 1981 ""MADE IN AMERICA"" release(for which 25 tracks were recorded).If this album doesnt satisfy,I would highly recommend HORIZON,CHRISTMAS COLLECTION AND LOVELINES."
1,"Give It Up, Richard!","I love the Carpenters and was suckered into buying this brand new CD. What a dog! It is clearly all of the music that was turned down by record producers everywhere for years. It's very heavy on Richard (yuck!) and light on Karen. A lot of instumentals with no vocals. It's a dog, folks. Not even a Carpenters fan, like me, could take this ""Ode to Richard."" Give it up, Richard. Sadly, the best half of the group is gone."
5,OUTSTANDING,"For any Carpenters fan who already has it all, this collection has several tracks from television specials and a few previously unreleased album outtakes. The best of the lot being ""Leave Yesterday Behind"" and ""The Rainbow Connection"". The famous medley of Karen Carpenter and Ella Fitzgerald alone is worth the purchase of this album. Also equally delightful is the short but entertaining ""Dancing In The Street""."
5,My Idol,AS Time Goes by is wonderful but I see it as Richard trying to make money off his dead sister.I can't not respect HIM for it but for Karen get the CD it's worth it for a REALLY BIG FAN.
5,New Music From An Old Friend,"My copy of ""As Time Goes By"" arrived yesterday. Listening to it, I had memories of watching the TV specials in the late 1970's and continued disbelief that Karen has been gone for 18 years. Most of all, though, I felt at home with the incredible voice that sang through so many moments in my life. Clearly, the gem here is ""Leave Yesterday Behind,"" which soars on its own merits and not as a derivative of ""For All We Know."" In light of the NY, DC, and Pennsylvania tragedies of the last few weeks, I found the song comforting and forward-looking. I've missed Karen's voice singing new songs, and I miss the innocent days when I heard many of these songs for the first time."
3,OK but dispensable,"Lots of the songs (taken from TV shows) were also recorded in studio and I must say that I prefer the studio versions. The other songs are light-weight and do not make a great addition to the Carpenters' discography.Finally, I really don't see why the ""Close Encounters/Star Wars"" medley needs to feature on this CD."
5,EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF RARITIES!,"I was so very happy when the Carpenters' ""As Time Goes By"" was released, although it should really be released in the U.S. also. As a long time fan it is nice to finally hear some new tunes by The Carpenters. I really enjoy Karen & Richards excellent percussion and keyboard work on ""I Got Rhythm"". ""Leave Yesterday Behind"" displays a more somber Karen singing with a melancholic yearning in her voice. On the other end it's nice to hear Karen with a slightly more aggressive nature on ""California Dreamin'"". My favorite song on this set is ""Rainbow Connection"", it's a beautiful song with a powerful message of love and hope. To our delight the hidden track ""And When He Smiles"" is the album's true highlight. This 1971 track recorded live for the BBC features an interesting rhythmic musical texture.On the whole ""As Time Goes By"" is a strong collection of rarities, and displays Karen and Richard's versatility and ability quite well."
5,Excellent - its good to hear 'new' material,"Buy this album! Its excellent, I love every track and have played it continuously since buying it. 'Rainbow Connection' is brilliant - it should be released as a single in the UK/US too. This album was well worth the wait and Richard has done an excellent of job of what sounds like a technical nightmare. If your an avid fan, this is the best release since the 'from the top' collection - lots of new material."
5,Better with age.,"I remember seeing this when it was just out. I thought Glenda was a little old for a leading lady. Now, I think she's quite charming. The movie has a mellow air to it. No violence or vulgarity; pleasant viewing. Open up a bottle of wine and start the movie."
5,So funny and well done!,"This movie is so much fun and cleaver! This may be an older movie, but even the kids loved it. Payback is just great the way Walter Matthau does it. For an evening of pure enjoyment, this one will fit the bill for sure."
4,Hopscotch - Criterion Collection,We are delighted with this movie. The DVD version is a replacement for a VHS tape we've had for years. It's simply one of the best and most enjoyable movies we've had.The DVD version is surperb!
5,Best movie ever,"This is a Classic. Laid back, funny and plenty of action. Loved it, it is one of my top ten lifetime favorites. We had it on tape and finally wore that out. I was thrilled to find a new more modern copy. It was exactly as i remembered it!"
5,A great caper movie -- but watch the language,"You know the plot already if you're looking at these reviews so I want to mention two things. First, Though ostensibly a thriller/spy movie, at heart it's a caper movie where a master ""outlaw"" (Matheau"", playing a rogue agent) outwits the police (the CIA, in this case). For it's wit, it's outstanding cast and it's wry humor I give it 5 stars.Second, the language can be a problem with plenty of four letter words uttered, as one of the reviewers makes note of. So what would otherwise be a very suitable family movie may not be in your case. The version I saw (not this DVD) had the bad language dubbed out which was actually somewhat jarring."
1,Hopscotch,We were very disappointed in this movie. It was rated as PG on Amazon but had very offensive language in it. We only got through about 10 minutes of it. It should have been rated differently. We thought we were receiving a family comedy mystery movie but that was not the case. We had to discard the movie because it was opened and could not be returned. Waste of money....:(
4,mature adventure/romance,"this is that rarety among movies in which the principles though older do not in any way become buffoon-like in their behaviour.though there it has a comic flavor;it respects mr matthau and ms jackson.the chase is so broad, that it runs like an adventure.this movie likes its characters for the most part (with one notable exception)think spy vs. spy vs. spy with an 80's look."
4,"If a spy movie could be light and fun, then this is it!","Walter Matthau plays a Miles Kendig, a CIA agent pushed out of the field into a desk job by a CIA youth movement. The story follows Kendig as he exacts revenge upon those in the agency who are responsible for is ""emasculation"".Matthau's performance is vintage Matthau and he is supported by an excellent cast (Julie Christie, Ned Beatty, Sam Waterston and Herbert Lom). Special effects and stunts are minimal, good dialogue and story are plentiful.This movie is a fun and entertaining romp through Europe as the cagey Kendig stays one step ahead of his pursuers."
5,was looking for a good video of this title,loved the movie. This was to replace a vhs tape that had flaws. I wanted a good viewing movie. I loved Mathau
5,one of the best Mathou movies released,Entertaining video by one of the classic actors. Should definitely be part of anyone's collection especially if they are a Mathou fan. Why can't this and other movies made starring Mathou be re-released. Another great is First Monday in October. Let's get the movie companies to make these available once again.
4,CIA? KGB? No problem!,"Miles Kendig (Matthau), a much-respected and veteran field agent is suddenly demoted. His smarmy boss (Ned Beatty) wants him out of the picture and reassigns Kendig as nothing more than a glorified clerk.Not to be outdone, Kendig sets out to even the score by revealing the dirty deeds of his career and those of his colleagues. Panic? You bet!Our hero settles the score more than once. With craft and guile, Kendig eludes his captors left and right. Sometimes, right under their very noses! The delight in this film comes from the ingenious twists and turns that Kendig invents.Glenda Jackson, in a supporting role, complements Matthau's droll manner superbly as does Sam Waterston as Kendig's protege and heir apparent.Like all good films, the enjoyment is in the watching and wondering what's going to happen next. ""HOPSCOTCH"" is all that and so much more."
1,Disappointed,"This DVD did not play on any of my devices! At the time of my order, I did not know it was being shipped from Europe!"
5,One of Walter Matthau's Best,"I finally found it - thanks to Amazon! Have been looking for ""Hopscotch"" for years - one of the best movies ever! Thanks, again."
5,"Fast, easy, and great tasting","My family (me, wife, and four kids) love this product. We use it to make muffins and pancakes. It is ""just add water"" easy to make muffins, and there is a simple recipe for pancakes on the back. We sometimes make chocolcate-chocolate chip muffins by adding a tablespoon of cocoa powder to the mix before adding the water. We usually use a mini-muffin pan to cook the muffins and the kids love to eat them for breakfast and for snacks. All of the muffins and pancakes we make come out tasting delicious. This product was hard to find in our local grocery stores, so we were delighted to see Amazon carry it and we use the subscribe&save to make sure we don't run out. Twelve thumbs up from our family!"
5,cryskittys,"Tastes great! This is my kind of product...""Just add water"".....can't beat that! This is the easiest way to make muffins or a loaf. I've even used the mix in my breadmaker on the quick bake setting and made two packages at the same time with great results. Allows you to have cake any time and especially nice for unexpected company (don't need anything but water).Bakes in less than 25 minutes even in my convection oven. The choc chip is delicious and there are 4 or 5 other flavors. Impossible to get in the grocery stores. I hope Amazon keeps offering these."
2,2 Chocolate Chips???,"I made 2 packs of this muffin mix, and made mini muffins. When I mixed it up, I noticed there were hardly any chocolate chips in the packages.We've eaten 15 of the 30 mini muffins, and only found TWO chocolate chips. It doesn't look like there are any in the remaining ones either. I will be calling Better Crocker in the morning to voice this complaint. My children were very disappointed"
2,Not as good as expected. Taste has diffrent.,"I found them first time at target and like very much and ordered it on Amazon (bulk quantity). I received them quickly but when I tried, it was not the same taste. I do not know what was missing but did not like it at all."
2,Expensive and Badly Designed Measuring Cap,"The measuring cap on the detergent is hard to read and not well designed. This may be in PG advantage, because some people will add too much soap rather than too little. And there is no indication of how many ounces that should be used. So a good detergent is expensive and the measuring cap is badly designed. I'll try something cheaper."
4,"Tide is the best, no Contest!","I love Tide, it gets everything squeaky-clean! We have five kids under the age of 11 years old, and they tend to stain everything (mud, grass, ketchup, jelly, etc). With Tide, I know I don't have to worry about pre-treating a stain, Tide will just get it clean! Clean Breeze scent is nice, but I like the Febreeze scent better. Won't buy from Amazon again though, even with Amazon's free shipping, I can still find it cheaper at wholesale clubs."
3,"great product, way overpriced on amazon","this is by far my favorite soap, however it runs about $13 a bottle at the grocery store."
5,Tide... always a good bet,I don't know why I am reviewing this since this product is no longer available. I got these at a great price. I love Tide. I love free shipping with my Prime membership! I love not having to lug heavy bottles of detergent home from the grocery store. It smells clean and gets out most stains well. I use it in my front loader HE machine. I will definitely buy more Tide when I run out.
3,I liked it...,"While this wasn't the best thriller/mystery I've ever read, it was a pretty good one. John has a secret life that he'd prefer stay uncovered. He has a good marriage, a daughter he adores and a successful business. Unfortunately for John, someone wants to change all that.After leaving for a short business trip, John comes home a wanted man after someone tried to commit a murder and it was blamed on him. From that point on, he's on the run trying to stay alive and figure out who is trying to kill him.The plot was good and had a nice twist to it. The character development was decent -- sufficient for the story, and the motives were feasible. While the book will keep your interest, it's no real page-turner. In other words, I didn't miss any sleep from trying to stay up and read more, but on the other hand, I was interested in finding out what would happen next. In sum, I liked it and give it 3.5 stars."
3,"educational but flimsy ""toy"" design","This book has good content and my 2- and 3-yr-olds have already learned from it (for example, ""this is India"" and ""this is how you spell Africa""). But my complaint is with the book design: the rocket magnifier is stored inside a clear plastic compartment in the book's cover. My children tore this plastic compartment off the book while trying to figure out how to open and close it to get the magnifier out/in. The magnifier is attached by a plastic spiral cord, and it's pretty hard to put the cord back inside the plastic compartment so that the plastic compartment will close properly. I wish the magnifier were attached with a string and I wish it clipped onto the front of the book (like many ""activity"" books that come with pens or other things attached); I just think that would have been more durable and easy for young preschoolers to handle. That said, my children love LE and are still excited about using the book!"
4,great book,"This is a good book and story, I do not like the little ""ship"" attached to the book. Very comberson. Still a good story though. My 4 year old loved it."
2,Ups and Downs,"It's a good book if you love Garfield, but don't come to expect it to be like the regular comic strips. The comedy is limited, and the book is short and thin, but at least it's color :)"
3,like a romance novel,"Definitely not up to my expectations after having read Replay. It's basically about a woman who seems to stop aging and her various experiences with husbands and lovers throughout a few centuries. There were some interesting thoughts, like would you really want to remain youthful forever? But, in general, it was more of a romance novel. Some books are ""quality books,"" this was more just a junky entertaining book. A good thing is that it's a quick read and relatively entertaining. If you want a quick read to fill up time, but if you're a Replay fan, it will surely disappoint. I would read Replay again, but I would not read Elise again."
4,"Amusing book, annoying Kindle glitches","I've read several of this author's books and enjoyed them all. This is the first one I've read on my Kindle, however, and though the Kindle glitches don't spoil it for me, they ARE distracting. Mainly there's a frequent odd-ball division of words. E.g. ""hierar chical""--twice! ""finish ed"" ""embarrass ment"" ""irri tant"" It's very irri tating. Once again, as I so often must, I ask myself ""are there no proofreaders left in the world?"" But answer comes there none."
4,"Gret book, poor reprint","An extremely clever and funny book. But if you can read it in the earlier edition, do so; the original prologue was a highlight for me and is sadly missing in this reprint - replaced by a prologue from another book. To lose the gorgeous exchange between the Burser and Amiss in favour of an unfunny conversation between Amiss and the uninteresting cipher character, Rachel, is a mistake I hope no-one made deliberately. But anyway, read the book - it's marvellous."
5,Sacajawea,"I first read this book when I was merely a girl. I can remember feeling transported, as though walking the same path as Sacajawea as we journeyed together. I had a well-worn copy that got lost in a move, and when I discovered it missing, I mourned it like the passing of a close friend. Rarely do you read a book and become so intertwined with the characters that you wish for a moment you were them. You will ache when she does, you will risk a smile when she does. You can read more reviews, but you are better off just buying the book and experiencing it for yourself. You will not be sorry. Your only regret will be that the story ends."
5,Sacajawea.....Excellent....I have read it twice,"I have read this twice, once to myself and the second time to my daughter. It has taken me three years now to read it to my daughter. A couple of pages every night before bed and now my daughter is an expert on ""Bird Woman"". Still after all these years, she still remembers all the story. We loved it"
3,"Good Reading, more fiction than history","The problem I had with this book is that is completely misrepresents the history of Sacajawea and the Lewis and Clark Expidition. The footnotes are mostly irrelevant, the dialougue between Lewis and Clark is laughable (imagine Clark calling Lewis ""you son of a gun""!) and the part about the Mandans descending from the Welsh is more fantasy than history.It is decent reading, but to actually think that you have gotten any insight to the time period from reading this book is wrong.Sacajaweas story is interesting enough in itself without having to make up goofy subplots about a love affair with Clark and a situation where Sacajawea is almost a leader in the L and C party. Also, Charbonneau couldnt have been the idiot and coward she portrays, considering his impressive background as a wilderness trader.Ugh. This book frustrated me more than anything."
5,Wonderful,"This is the book that got me interested in this time period. Lush, colorful words and great characters with a plot one can only think is a piece of fiction. Although some poetic license is taken to move the plot along, the book is very close to what really happen. This is the adventure that made our country sea to shining sea. Everyone should read this. It is just the best."
5,Sacajawea,It was a replacement for a borrowed book as the cover on the borrowed book got bent. My friend was very pleased with the replacement!
3,Bought it for a friend,"I have not read so can't comment on this book. A friend had read it many years ago and lost her copy after Hurricane Katrina. I bought this as replacement, and she is happy to have it again."
5,Love!,"A wonderful historical novel well written by ms. Waldo..alot of details of the travels, lives, emotions of our founders of the westward trails..a novel I will never forget and will read again. I have learned alot from this book!"
5,Sacajawea and her times.,"This is probably one of the greatest historical fictions that I have ever read. I would recommend it without reservation.A wonderful and colorful representation of one of the greatest women heroes of our American Past.Crossing cultural lines. Living as slave, wife and scout her story paints a magnificient picture of this exciting piece of American History.Not only does the story depict Sacajawea but also presents an colorful and very interesting view of what the world was like at that time for both Native Americans and the Euro American population of our young country.READ THIS BOOK!!! You will not regret it."
5,One of my favorite books,"I can reinforce the reviews of the other readers; this is a facinating story and written so well that the length is not an issue. A year or so after I read this book, I was on a family vacation. We happened to be driving through the Wind River reservation in Wyoming, and stopped to read one of those historical markers, which indicated that the grave of Sacajewea was nearby. I became quite emotional at finding her grave in the old cemetery. I felt very attached; in the presence of the real story of Sacajewea."
2,print is too small,"I gave this book a 2 star rating, not because of the story but unfortunately, the print is too small and I wasn't able to finish reading this wonderful classic (which I read when the book first came out)."
5,Sacajawea,This was a repurchase of a much enjoyed book from many years ago. I wanted my granddaughter to experience the journey I took in reading Sacajawea. My expectations are high that she will love it. I was very pleased to find it was still available through Amazon.
5,One of my favorite books,"I have had this book for at least 10 years, and it is one of the few I reread every few years. It is rich with detail, well written, and historically fascinating. I love that it is long, because it is a book I hate to finish. If you like historical fiction, this title is well worth it."
5,Sacajawea,I read the book while travelling in our Motor Home along the Lewis & Clark trail and I found it to be most adventurous book I have ever read and I can hardly wait to read it again. It was wonderful and I rate it in the top 5 of all books I have read.
5,BEST EVER!!!!,"I saw the series, I bought the videos that were available and the CD, and never forgot it! I still play it and cry over it. I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH ALL HERE WHO GAVE IT A FIVE STAR RATING!!! Ron recites the poetry perfectly- with meaning, and the beautiful music accompanies it also perfectly. Brings back the wonderful memories of the Series, which I thought was BEST SHOW EVER ON TV!!! IMO"
3,"Edited version is a real bummer, man.","I know Psych-Out pretty well, so I was very happy when it was released on DVD. Unfortunatly, scene after scene on this disk has been edited, or cut short, so they could fit two movies on one disk, I guess. Max Julian's excellent acid trip is practically cut out of the movie. You miss him paint 'love' over the stop sign as he babbles ""beautiful... really beautiful."" You might notice that 'Incense and Peppermints' ends abruptly early. This is really awful. I'm sorry to say it, because I've wanted this movie on disk for so long. What more can I say? A fun movie, but you don't get all of it on this disk. I haven't been able to bring myself to see if they left The Trip intact, it's a weaker movie though. These movies are worth adding to your collection. It's just too bad you don't get the whole movie. Why did they do this?"
3,Half-baked brownies?,"Was there nothing that modern technology could do to make the soundtrack to ""The Trip"" listenable? It sounds muffled and dialogue is sometimes hard to follow - I don't recall having this problem when I saw the film theatrically. Maybe they were trying to re-create the drive-in speaker experience. And why on earth edit ""Psych-Out,"" truthfully the better of the two films? Extras are okay, and thanks for the letterboxing, but this should have been a four-star reissue, at least."
1,Cropped version,"This version of Psych-Out was made from a full screen version, where the left and right sides had been cropped. Then to make this version, they cropped the top and bottom so the image would fit a modern 16:9 monitor. What you see when you watch the version on this DVD is a small rectangle that was cut from the center of the original movie.The full screen version showed up recently on broadcast TV, and I wanted to see the parts that had been cropped off the sides, so I got hold of a copy of this DVD. Although this DVD is labeled ""widescreen"" in the description on Amazon, it actually shows less of the original movie than the cropped full screen version. I'd say anyone who buys this on Amazon is entitled to a refund because the term ""widescreen"" implies, incorrectly in this case, that you are getting the entire original image."
1,A TRAVESTY!,We've been waiting for this on DVD for how long? And someone butchers it? PSYCH-OUT is a fun movie...if anything extra/cut footage should have been ADDED! Along with BONUS features.Shameful.
5,CAPTAIN TRIPS,This was truly a vivid reality check into the world of the 60's drug den and it's effects!
3,I was so excited when I saw Psych-Out was on dvd,"It is such a fun movie, and has the best cheese that a 60s psychedelic flick can bring. But reading the reviews, and finding that the movie has been cut, is disappointing. Why would they do that?? Can someone post how much is cut from it, and what scenes? I'm still debating whether or not to buy it anyway.""The Trip"" is pretty boring, but still worth watching once if you're into these kinds of movies."
5,Magical Music,"If want to get into other universes without drugs, just buy this CD. Pieter Nooten (Clan of Xymox) with Micheal Brook (some works with B. Eno and many more) made The Perfect 4AD Sound Album. Just turn off the light, eat cinnamon chocolate and listen.It's not music for relaxation. It's music for stimulating mind and imagination. It takes listeners far beyond known emotions.Marcin Mastykarz"
4,Old School Xymox,"If you like the sound of the first two albums of Clan of Xymox, you should like this album. In fact, several of the tracks here are re-arrangements of one's on those albums. Nooten's hauntingly off-key vocals and melodies really took me back to the days when I first discovered Xymox. In fact, many of these tracks would sound excellent fitting in between any of early Xymox's more up-beat pieces. Get it while you can!"
1,this makes me sleep with the fishes and even the sharks,"This whole album is a rip off copy of David Sylvian , you know the bloke dreesed in white who used to sing in Japan.The fact that Brook & Nooten had to re record clan of xymox songs is also beyond me, one recording is more than enuff.Truth is that the album is beautiful in its own way but with all the little snippets all over the place , some songs recorded 3 times over as they could not make up their mind which 1 to take is a bit much.Also, why did these guys never made a follow up? Or did everyone fell asleep not to notice?I give it 1 star because I heard Nootens terrible techno crap with First Contact and Brooks Albino Crocodile ( or Aligator-whatever)!"
3,Interesting and helpful overviews only,"I really wanted a book I could go to as a source of instruction in how to improve both my knowledge of and my spinning itself. This is exactly what it says in the title... an encyclopedia... each entry is only sentences long and from sheep to tools does not give the wealth of information I thought it might from the other reviews. Each entry leaves unanswered most of the questions I wanted answered. It is also a bit outdated as several of the fibers I am spinning are not even in it, ect. Over-all an interesting overview. I would not buy it at anything higher than the original cover price as you can get this information elsewhere, but if you just want a touch on most spinning fiber things this may be exactly what you are looking for, just remember it is an encyclopedia only."
4,great first cd!,"this fusion of techno and hardcore is great! this band only got better with their second cd, but their first cd has some winners as well! check it out for sure!"
1,Defective and off by 2 degrees,"Strangely, this thermometer read two degrees higher than a good old fashioned made in USA mercury thermometer; checked it against another digital thermometer with the same result."
1,Horrible unreliable product,This has to be the worst product for taking a temperature on the market :(It is unreliable and doesnt work well at all
2,Inaccurate,I have been using this thermometer for a week now with reading around 97.7 - 97.9 during the morning hours. I thought this was low so tried my temp later on in the day getting readings anywhere from 96.6 - 97.1. I bought a new thermometer today and my temperature reads just fine. This is a nice thermometer for what it does but I need accuracy to track my cycles.
5,Works as advertised,Product seems to be a good quality product. Accurate with and without using a thermometer cover. Happy with my purchase!
3,Good for price,"This thermometer is not perfect, but useful. It provides relatively accurate and consistent readings. However display is too small and beep is not loud enough."
1,Trah,"Tried and tried to get it to read Fahrenheit, but could never do it, wasn't worth the money that I spent"
4,Seems to work great,"I was looking for a decent-priced thermometer to keep in the medicine cabinet and this one fit the bill. Good price, quality is as expected, it's basic and it works. It does come with a few plastic tip covers if that makes a difference to you."
1,Not consistent,"I have taken my temp back to back and I get a different reading each time. Doesn't beep either, so u have to take it out and look at the gauge to see if it's done. Does not work!"
5,great! but....,"I'm a big GK fan.This album is magic but hey, don't mess with 'Hotel california'-thats eagles and eagles alone!!!!"
5,added to tool set,Just wanted to add to my tool set looked good price good Lisle are good tools I would recommend it
4,All around good product!,"Fishfinder works as it should, temp is very accurate and shows fish well. This fishfinder works as well as any other that I have had.My $1600.00 one on 26' boat does not work any better."
3,Garmin 400c Review,"The Garmin is a good unit. I replaced a non functioning Lowrance unit with the Garmin. It does not have the detail or sensitivity the Lowrance unit had, but I needed a quick cheap replacement. I would wait and spend the extra money for a good Lowrance Sonar."
2,Headache inducing,"Try as I might, I don't appreciate these songs. Sometimes the beat is clever and sometimes one of the three members of this trio displays a more than adequate voice, but there is no real meat to any of these tracks. Leave the dance music to Madonna or Cher (or even Lauper in remix mode), but this CD will bring on a headache in no time flat."
1,BEYONCE IS A TOTAL JOKE !!!,This girl we like to call BEYONCE is so untalented it isn't funny!!! Their latest release from this album which was supposed to benefit children or whatever is another sorry excuse to try to get their last Publicity Time before they go out of date . Beyonce even has a song on here where she is the only one singing . She is not very respectful to the rest of the group and I think she thinks she is better than the other two girls who actually sing better at the lame songs they sing anyways . BEYONCE MAKES THE CD UNBEARABLE !!! NOT A GOOD BUY !!!
1,Vastly overrated,"while Beyonce is a Decent Vocalist I still ain't herd one song by her with DC or Solo that merits even half the hype She gets. most of these Songs are a dime a dozen to me.I give them Hustle Dap for lasting longer than I thought they would.but most of these songs could have easily been sung by any of the other Vocal Female groups.Beyonce does have that showbiz ""IT"",but these songs don't move me enough to get wowed.I don't care how many Records DC sells they ain't no Supremes or a Emotions.Heck they ain't even TLC for my money.a few catchy songs&alot of filler,but hey it worked."
1,BAW-RING !,"DC IS overrated. Compared to other girl-groups who have had more meaningful hits, and distinctive sounds, DC's commercial success eclipses what lacklustre material they've released. The only song that I've ever liked was Jumpin' Jumpin'. Inde Women was quite good, but honestly, Survivor was so bad when I first heard it, I just laughed. It was just so cheesy, and the melody, well, there wasn't one. Comparisons to earlier groups like En Vogue, TLC, SWV and Xscape are just not in order!!! Given the same kind of publicity these days, those groups would have outdone DC easily. Oh yes, and it's painful to always just hear, and see, Beyonce as the lead."
4,Checking on it,The personification of drive is ever present. This is another great CD to add to their collective output. They continue to enthrall and amaze. As Inspector Clouseau would say: Good one!
3,Destiny not so fulfilled...,"After four excellent studio albums, one could have expected much more from the one-time foursome turned trio, in the shape of an exhaustive and exciting greatest hits collection.Unfortunately #1s is a patchwork that lacks cohesion and consistency. For one thing, some of DC's funkier and more obscure singles were unfortunately left out - namely With Me, Get on the bus, and Nasty Girl. The opening track from the album, although pleasant, provides us with a sound that DC had not served us before, and which stands out as an inapropriate ballad opening to an up-tempo rnb cd.These two arguments are enough to keep your hands off the compilation and reach towards all 4 of DC's studio LPs - which offer much more excitement and stand out as solid projects.As for this compilation, it is a little sad for the girls to bid their fans farewell with such an average collection."
3,OK NOT MY FAVORITE,"I LIKE DESTINYS CHILD ENOUGH TO TOLORATE THEM. THEY HAVE A FEW GOOD SONGS. IVE NEVER SEEN A BAND GO THRU SO MANY MEMBERS AS DESTINYS CHILD. MY FAVORITE DESTINYS CHILD SONG IS ""SAY MY NAME"". I LIKE THIS SONG BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD BEAT AND IT CATCHES THE GUY CHEATING. IF YOU ONLY LIKE A FEW DESTINYS CHILD SONGS THIS ISNT THE CD FOR YOU. IF YOURE A DIE HARD FAN GET IT."
4,Not really the greatest!!!,"I know this album brings huge hits from DC3 (""Survivor"", ""Say My Name"", ""Lose My Breath"" and more...), my favorite song on it is ""Bootylicious"", but I really missed ""Get On The Bus"" and ""Nasty Girl"")...I don't understand the reason why a group includes 3 brand new songs if only one will become a radio and TV hit...!"
3,Conflicted,"I love about half the tracks, like most the rest, and can do without a few. The Long Black Line really speaks to post Katrina N.O."
5,Loving these spatulas!,"This is the second Calphalon spatula I have bought. I love these because they are so easy to clean and the handles don't heat up. The tips won't melt either. I'm very satisfied, but be sure to buy them on sale!"
4,A stimulating insight in animal (and human) behaviour,"A well balanced, unique mix of ethology and sociobiology, with strong emphasis on the biologic and evolutionary sides of behaviour. It is concise but is easy reading. A must have, for those seriously interested in the field."
4,Good Textbook,"I didn't have a choice what book to purchase as this is a required text for a class, but it is a good book. It has great examples and details, and offers additional reading suggestions at the end of each chapter. It is actually a textbook that enhances learning/understanding instead of another textbook that confuses students and sits unread on a bookshelf."
3,One Curious Cat,"Henry wants to fly. Meow! Hot Air Henry, by Mary Calhoun (William Morrow, 1981), is the purrfect story of a willful Siamese cat who wants to take his feline talents one step further. While his owner isn't looking Henry leaps up into the basket of a hot air balloon that sends him soaring into a blue winter sky. Fear isn't an option for Henry, as he quickly learns how the balloon works.With Henry as the narrator and Erick Ingraham's images cleverly positioned, the reader is able to experience the hot air balloon through Henry's eyes. When Henry looks down on the world below or rushes to catch a crew of blackbirds, so does the reader. Although the images are mildly unclear, they are skillfully contrasted against a snowy white landscape. Still, while the story's pace is quick and suspenseful, the obstacles and finale are expected. The book aligns with a child's introduction to spirit and perseverance in the face of all odds."
5,Great author. Great book!,My daughter and I love the Henry books. Each one of this author's books are fun and enjoyable for both the parent and the child. We also love the artwork in the books. Henry the Cat is a fun character for all children to enjoy.
3,Disappointing mechanism,"Got this for my grandson who loves to watch the forklifts at Home Depot and was initially thrilled with it. Then, found the mechanism for the ""tilt"" does not work ---- sent for another thinking it was defective ------ still won't work properly. My son called Tonka and found out they do not even make it, but it just has their name on it and they had no solution. I would avoid this!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"The Tonka Forklift and truck was one of my 4 year old son's big gifts for Christmas this year. It was a disaster! One of the 3 control functions did not work. He was still able to play with the other two controls, but the ""heavy"" boxes to lift were made of cardboard and did not have enough weight to stay on the forklift with any kind of movement. They kept falling off. It was very frustrating for him. We also bought him Tonka Crane which was another bad toy. The arm from the crane would not stay up, so we won't be purchasing any Tonka products in the near future!"
2,Funrise toys are lame,"All of the Funrise ""Tonka"" Mighty Motorized, Hands-On, trucks are cheaply constructed. They will not last and eat batteries like crazy! I recommend non motorized, especially Little Tikes. They are bullet proof!"
3,"ARK : ""ARK"" - Debut Release","*** - THREE STARS==================This, Ark's debut, isn't nearly as polished, or as impressive as their follow-up ""Burn The Sun"". It's an interesting mixture of Metal, and has it's momments, but the production hold it back in my opinion....This is an excellent group of musicians, and on ""Brun The Sun"", they totally blow you away, this however isn't as good as advertised. It's worth 3 stars based on originality and overall execusion, but it's missing something...Regardless, a decent purchace. If you have ""BTS"", and like it as much as I do, you should probably add this to your collection..."
2,Buy Burn the Sun instead of this one,"I'm a big fan of prog/metal and neo-classical. I found out about ARK by accident surfing around. I listened to the bytes of Burn The Sun and bought it. It really rocks and the musicianship on it is fantastic. So I figured their debut to be at least as good. I find that typically bands debut's are their best albums, since the all want to come out kicking butt. Not so with ARK. The production horrible and the playing is disappointing, with the exception of the drum work. In short, dont waste your money on this one, get Burn the Sun."
1,WHY MAKE A 2ND CD BUT I'M GLAD THEY DID,I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RECORDING ON THIS CD BECAUSE IT REALLY SUCKS BAD.I HAVE A PRETTY DECENT STEREO SYSTEM IN MY TRUCK & I CAN'T MAKE THIS CD SOUND WORTH A CRAP..ON THE OTHER HAND BURN THE SUN IS KICKIN SOME SERIOUS BUT..DON'T BUY THE 1ST CD WHAT EVER YOU DO BUT DEFFENETLY BUY THE 2ND........P.SI SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN GIVEN THIS A 1 STAR....
5,Kingdom Hearts forever!!!!,"This is a very good cd. But be careful when buying, because this one is the Japanese version. Here's how you can tell: If you look at the top of the case you see a Mickey Mouse head if it's the English version; You won't see it if it's the Japanese version though. My parents bought me the Japanese version by accident. & I really wanted the English one because it had Simple & Clean. But if you get this one it'll be the Japanese version of Simple & Clean."
5,Just like mama used to make,"Bakesale is not only filled with wonderful, accessible, easy to make recipes, it is fun to read. Sampson has taken recipes from friends, relatives and friends of friends and turned them into just the kind of desserts I like to make. So far I have made Aunt Suzy's Chocolate chip gooey bars, engagement brownies, strawberry rhubarb pie and sour cream poppy seed cake. They were as promised, excellent. She also does not use any hard to get ingredients: every thing i made was made primarily from ingredients i already had and those things i was missing were easy to find. Like her previous book The Fifty Dollar Dinner Party, I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and will buy more to give as gifts."
5,"Fun, inspiring, makes you want to bake!",A totally fun book to read! I've marked page after page of cookies and bars and cakes I just HAVE to make -- and I am not a baker -- but this book just makes you want to get in the kitchen and start flouring pans! Plus a lot of recipes can be done with your kids. Your school bake sale will be a gourmet feast.
4,Baking for Everyone!,"Sally Sampson has compiled an excellent selection of recipes that you want to bake, and actually work - a combination that's hard to come by.The Banana bread is absolutely the best I've ever made, and I highly recommend the Lemon Glazed Pecan and Coconut Squares.Some other delicious sounding recipes include; Fresh Ginger Gingerbread, Classic Butter Cake, and Three Layer Mint Brownies.Ms. Sampson has included helful hints about where not to overbeat, how recipes were developed and option add ins or variations to some of the basic recipes.What is missing is storage information with each recipe - how long it will keep- fridge, freezer or room temp and even pacakging for selling at bakesales would have been nice since that is THE premise of the book. Still it's a keeper and all the recipes I've tried have been successful!"
1,not a real bake sale book,"The author may be a great cook, but she is obviously neither an expert baker nor a frequent contributor to bake sales. Other than the blurb on the back of the book, there is no discussion within the book on those factors that make for a good bake sale item. But what concerns me more than anything else is a fundamental problem with the book and the recipes: bake sale items do not have their contents labeled--thus the use of nuts within an item (a frequent occurence in this book) presents a potential problem for consumers. The author does not even suggest how this problem might be overcome.If you want 100 recipes for baked goods, this cookbook is as good as any other. If you want recipes for bake sale goods, look elsewhere."
2,not fool proof,"I have never written an on-line review for a book before, but this one has compelled me to do so. I have been cooking for years, with much success, until this book. I have made 3 recipes, and so far, not one has turned out.The book itself is well written with many interesting (albeit not innovative) recipes. She has different chocolate chip cookie, brownie, cake, and bread recipes. I tried the chocolate chip cookies, which spread out thinly, all over the cookie sheet. Ok, no big deal, try again. Ha! The other two didn't turn out either!I can't recommend this book because it's very doubtful that there is a recipe in here you don't already have in your collection. In addition, the recipes are NOT fool proof. Proceed with caution."
1,You'll never learn grammar from this book.,"I bought this book after doing a brief review on-line and after reading the five-start comments and it turned out to be a big disappointment. It claims to be in plain English but, what it really is, is a very poorly organized book explaining grammar in a different vocabulary than what most of those who study languages know. Good luck finding rules, exceptions, etc. in this book. If you are a foreign student learning English, forget it, it will be completely useless to you. This is definetely going to be returned and replaced by a better book."
4,Did It's Job,"Took some elbow grease and a couple of applications, but the dark blue section of my Bryant boat that had faded by Sun exposure was restored to match the boat's unfaded areas. I then applied two coats of Starbrite boat polish and finish looks like new. Too soon to tell how well it will hold up.I did notice when I was applying polish that some blue was still showing up on the rag which makes me fearful that sun damage may not ever be completely repaired. Probably will need to maintain a good coat of wax/polish to prevent rapid fading of these areas."
5,This is a great novel,Get this novel at whatever cost. It's a great read! and even profound at times.
5,Excellent,Wonderful product. Exactly what I needed and wanted. I think it is better than other similar products. The one-handed use function is superb!
5,nice wine rack,this is perfect for our needs. It lives in a closet and holds plenty of wine. If you are in search of a decorative rack this is probably not what you want. If I decide to store more wine I will definately order another.
5,great product,"we love this wine rack, it was very easy to put together and it looks great in my kitchen. The delivery took a bit longer than expected, but it was free."
5,Gave this as a Christmas gift...they LOVED it!,"I had been looking for a nice, not too big, wine rack for my brother as a Christmas present this year. He was totally surprised and thought it was awesome! After he put it together, I asked to see pictures, and he posted some on Facebook... it look really nice! He is so happy with it. I'm glad I chose it. He liked the fact that there was a top to it, unlike most other wine racks. He set it up in his kitchen and it goes with everything."
4,"Sturdy, compact and just what is needed","This rack is easy to build and sturdy. The look of it is modern and clean. It fits in small spaces and the wood top is great for extra storage. I added sliders on the feet for easier moving on carpet but otherwise it is a great and value-priced rack. Definitely an improvement over my old ""rack"" which consisted of cardboard wine cases."
2,Poor Quality - However customer service corrected,"Although it is easy to put together, the wood is damaged & warped, leaving the wine rack less than sturdy.Update - 1/20/09 : Sent Winsome the parts request form to replace the warped wood on 12/31/08. Rec'd the new parts on 1/16/09. This increased stability to an acceptable level for the price. Based on finished product, customer service turn-around time, price, and overall experience, I would increase my rating from 2.0 stars to 3.5 stars."
2,Winsome Wood 28 bottle wine rack,Quality was not what I expected and price was a bit high for an assembly piece. Finish was dull and lacked appeal.
4,Good wine rack for the price,This is a really good wine rack for the price. The wood split a little bit when I was putting it together so be careful to not torque the wrench too hard. It feels a little light and not too sturdy but once you put the bottles in slots it gets weighted down and is much better.
5,"Wine,wine,wine","Christmas gift for my husband he loved it, a so did I. Friend can over for Christmas he loved it,so I will order another for him."
4,Good Value for the purpose,"We wanted a small, inexpensive wine rack to hold 20-25 bottles of wine and to be stored in our basement. Nothing fancy....just functional. We thought this might fill the bill....we even ordered two of them....and we are pleased with the purchase. Seems sturdy enough and actually has some ""look"" to it, if you are interested in placing it in a more attractive area."
5,Small apartment,"I have a small apartment and this fit just perfect, its very well built,Gives me room to add to my small wine collection."
4,Great wine rack for the price,"This rack is perfectly presentable wood, considering it's the least expensive rack I could find. I keep my bottles in my cool dark basement, so don't actually care about the look. Except for one flaw, I would not mind having this in my dining room. The wood is cheap pine, so I can't really quibble about the knothole they filled in with putty or whatever that fake wood stuff is.If you are going to keep the rack in a room that gets any traffic, you may not want to store burgundy-style bottles on it. The grooves that hold the bottles are best suited to bordeaux-style bottles with pronounced shoulders that will catch in the groove. The sloped shoulders of burgundy bottles could cause a jostled bottle to slip out of the rack. That could be tragic."
5,"Sturdy, straightforward to assemble","I bought this as a christmas gift for my mother. It assembled fairly easily with the included allen wrench, although I ended up using a rubber mallet for the little peg caps what cover the bolts. It feels pretty solid. It's not anything fancy, but I'm pretty sure she means to keep it in an unfinished basement, so that's not really a major concern. At any rate, my mother is happy with it."
5,As described and easy to assemble,Blonde hardwood (not veneer) and easy to assemble. Preserves and displays our small wine collection. I would recommend to any wine lover.
1,low quality,"I'm not sure if I received a bum unit, but the edges that hold the top of the wine rack to the bottom were basically stripped and falling off when I opened the box. I had to find 4 slightly larger screws to hold it together and assemble it.Once assembled this is an OK wine rack, though definitely not a high end, display item you would want in a nice cellar, living room etc. I'll put it in my closet to house any extra bottles of wine...simple storage at best. IKEA could do better than this...and probably does.Personally I would not order it looking back, but the question arises, do you go through the hassle of returning it, or just fix it.Made in Thailand."
3,a crack,"I was so excited to see that my item had arrived until I opened up the box where a crack, and chip, of the rack was visible. I had to immediately use a kit to restore the crack because you could see the crack from afar."
4,Amazon wine rack,"One side was a little hard to put together. I needed to use my own tools, but it is very sturdy and very nice looking. It was worth the effort"
4,"For the price, well worth it","The Winsome 28 bottle wine rack was a decent purchase, it came with natural varnish so no further finishing required. Assembled easily, although one of the pre-cut cross members had split in transit I presume, easily corrected with some wood glue. Once assembled, stands true and steady, and fits standard sized bottles (700-775ml) nicely. Would be good to see on of the bays hold a larger capacity bottle, such as a magnum size, even if it reduced the total carrying capacity. All in all a good purchase for the money, I'd recommend it to those with only a few bottles needed to store and on a budget."
5,Sweet little wine rack!,"Got my wine rack yesterday. I got home at about 9:30pm and couldn't wait to put it together so I did :) I had it up and stocked within the hour! With a bit of muscle power, I got it pieced and set up pretty quickly. My only complaint is the Allen wrench that comes with the hardware wasn't so great so I had to use my own but I love it! It's sturdy and beautiful. Excited to add another case of wine to it :)"
4,"good product, but prepare to need hand surgery after assembling it.","OK, let me start by saying that I like the wine rack. The finished product looks nice and, well, holds wine. But the assembly was TERRIBLE. They provide you very large allen-type screws (which is good because they are sturdy) and expect you to force them through tiny pre-drilled holes with a rinky-dink allen wrench they also give you (which is not good). It is NOT easy, and after the 3rd or 4th screw the wrench starts to disintegrate and become rounded off. I strongly recommend using your own (superior) allen wrench set or wearing gloves to protect your hands from their awful, evil, terrible wrench."
1,flimsy wood arrived broken,flimsy wood piece arrived cracked. Supplying a drill bit for the hex screws would have increased the rating by two stars. No need to buy this piece of junk
4,Solid for the price,The wood is surprisingly decent for such a cheap rack and it is pretty solid once it is put together. The only problem I had was it was slightly off from being perfectly level. I put a quarter under one of the legs and it is now stable. This rack is great if you live in an apartment or on a tight budget. If you have the money get a rack that's of better quality such as J.K. Adams or Architectural Designs.
5,excellent purchase,"Attractive to look at, easy to assemble. This wine rack is excellent, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a moderate sized rack."
5,Very good wine rack,I purchased one rack about a year ago and I am very happy with it. It was easy to assemble and is well made. I just purchased two more today.
4,Nice rack,This was exactly what my dad needed and fit the space perfectly. He wants a 2nd one for another narrow wall in the dining room. I was concerned it would be top heavy and wobble but it's very sturdy and was easy to put together. Looks nice and feels solid. My only issue is wine bottles with long slender necks don't fit well. Actually knocked one out and it busted all over the hardwood floor. Other than that it's perfect.
5,Perfect for our needs,We have used this several times since purchasing. We are a internet based bakery making custom cakes. This tool is perfect for rolling out fondant. The price is fantastic. A similar rolling pin in the stores is at least $15 - $20 more. I highly recommend it for bakers!
3,"Marble is nice, manufacture not so much","The rolling pin I received had a very nice finish, and the marble seems to be good quality. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the hole through the marble is not centered correctly. This means that you can feel a (pretty pronounced) wobble when you use the rolling pin."
4,Feel like a weight lifter weilding a rolling pin,"This is the most substantial rolling pin I have ever worked with! I have been using a pampered chef roller for several years. I thought I missd my mother's wooden rolling pin that I grew up with, but this one is awesome. It is so solid and heavy, I barely have to apply pressure. Before, it always felt like I was breaking a sweat getting pizza crusts and pie crusts to roll out. And the price is awesome!! My one issue is that we haven't found a place to store it, but it looks pretty on the counter! And the base is great so it doesn't roll off and hurt little ones."
1,off-center pin,"I upgraded from a ceramic rolling pin to this marble one. The marble is drilled off center in my pin, like in other reviews. I gave purchased it knowing there was a chance of this, but I had hoped the error had been corrected or perhaps only a few people received a defective product. My pin was nice and smooth, only one nick in it.The product packaging is just a cardboard box, with no paper, foam, or bubble wrap to protect the product; it arrived in a shipping box with paper to prevent breakage, but the product box itself (not the shipping box) was damaged. I was just going to through the box out, so I didn't care, but if you were giving it as a gift you might not receive a presentable item. The packaging is probably only designed for a shelf display rather than being purchased online then shipped.I would have kept it if the holes hadn't been off-center on both sides of the pin. At least I didn't have to pay for return shipping."
2,Poorly Manufactured...,"I just pulled this out of the box and it looks great, the finish of the stone is nice, the handles are comfortable, and the base is a nice little bonus... HOWEVER, the stone is not drilled straight through the center, so the pin rocks and wobbles as you roll with it... I hope that this is just a fluke, as it is otherwise a nice product..."
5,Purchasing my second one!,I purchased one of these 20 years ago when I was setting up my first kitchen. I LOVE THIS ROLLING PIN!! Not only does the added weight of the marble make rolling pastry a breeze but the marble holds a chill from the freezer making it virtually non-stick!! I'm ordering a new one because the wood handle finally broke off recently but the marble is just a beautiful as it was 20 years ago.
1,"Shipping a joke, Center Hole off center","Shipped to me with this heavy stone roller just thrown in a box. Edge was chipped. Then, as I tried to use it, I found the hole in the center drilled about 1/4"" off center. So as you roll it, your hands on each side oscillate up and down. Total crap.Amazon Customer Service refunded money and told me not to even return the worthless piece of rock. Kudos for the good service for this junk product."
5,"great product, cheap price","this marble rolling pin is heavy enough that you have a good grip for rolling your dough. I use it on a marble tray, it matches perfectly and it is not sticking.Pretty cheap for the quality!"
2,Marble Rolling Pin,"Bought two, the handle came off of one within 5 minutes of the first use. Looks like it's quality but doesn't seem well constructed."
2,"Off center handles, doesn't roll easy","I just opened the box and examined the rolling pin. The 'axle' is off-center so it wobbles when you spin/roll it. I can deal with that I guess, but I didn't expect that problem. The ""nylon ball bearings"" might have well been a wad of chewing gum -- it doesn't roll very nicely at all. I think I can also deal with that. I will have to use it a bit and decide if it is annoying enough to return."
5,Great Rolling Pin,"Warning - weighs a ""ton"", but a wonderful rolling pin - would recommend it to anyone. Great value"
5,rolling pin,this has to be the best rolling pin ever made!!! It really is a top quality product - should last just about forever. I would highly recommend this pin if you cook a lot.
4,Marble Rolling Pin,This was a great Christmas present for my daughter. She loves how the marble keeps the dough cold and doesnt break up the butter.
4,as if one living painting wasnt enough...,"mother likes making dangerous artwork! she sends one group of the remnants, miss blake, jobs, mo'steel, olga gonzalez and the forever-sleeping billy weir from the tower of babel to hell. meanwhile, wylson is under the impresssion that she could turn the tower of babel into a base or something when it disappears. and the secret of the eyeless-mutant-alien-baby-thing is finally told..."
4,Received quickly during the holiday rush!,I bought this item as a gift and the recipient received it quickly during the holiday rush. She loves it. Thank you!
3,"Fun game, but....","My son loved getting this game for Christmas, and couldn't wait to play it. He had a lot of fun with it. The reason for the 3 stars, however, is that he had the game for less than 2 weeks and fully beat it. And this is a child who is lucky to play video games once a week and admittedly not very good at them.If he was someone to play games a lot it would have been very disappointing to him. But, he enjoyed it, so I guess it was worth it for the 2 weeks since he hasn't touched it since."
3,The Powers That Be,"David Halberstam is an excellent, Pulitzer prize winning author. This is a 700+ page book so I'm only partially into it but it seems excellent once again."
2,Flat-out Dull,"The topic sounds good, and his books usually are great reads, but this one was dull city. I could not even finish it. Found myself skipping over many pages and finally gave up. This is one dry read and so it is a long, long book. When my mind was wandering about the gym, the grocery store, calling my sister, things like that, you know it is time to put the book down for good and move on."
2,Too many words,"While the story line is gripping and the characters full of promise, Shane Lester's overabundance of descriptive adverbs, adjectives, and superlatives make the first chapter a slow go. One feels trapped by the shear wordiness of his writing. _Clan of Cain_ shows promise, but soon leaves the reader with the feeling that they are immersed in a picture book done with words. If you like being able to paint a perfect picture in your mind of your characters' surroundings then you'll like this book. The first sentence is an excellent example of nearly every sentence in the opening pages: ""The hooves of the laggard, old, brown mule crushed the leaves lying gently on the autumn trail, which descended and stretched east into the thicket of dense trees outside Paris, Tennessee."""
4,outter-space music for sexy earthlings,"From what I've heard, this cd is the better of the two made by ""Trance"". I was first turned on to them by someone I know in the fetish scene. I know little about this artist except to say that this is what to buy if you want to put yourself or others into a way-out spacey mood. When played in the right environment under the right conditions, it is hauntingly seductive."
5,3/16 vinyl coated steel wire rope,"We bought this to use as deck railing. It worked perfectly, looks great. Very easy to handle. If you want a stylish deck railing this is the perfect solution. It also does not obstruct your view. Very good price, I checked around and couldn't find it for a better price."
5,great price great item,i'm using it to build a fence cheaply that my fence guy wanted a ton of money for. great deal
4,garnet earrings,They were a gift for my mother. I haven't heard back how she likes them. They came pretty quickly. Great service.
5,Great book for learning to tell time!,Both of our kids learned to tell time (correctly) from this book (before age 3)! It is an excellent tool and provides both a manual and digital clock for children to learn with. Highly recommend!
3,The lack of applications renders it weak for the modern student of abstract algebra,"The fundamental elements of abstract algebra have not changed in the fifty years since this book was published. Therefore, if your interest is in learning the fundamentals of groups, rings, ideals and fields, then this book will suffice. However, if you are interested in the applications of these structures, then you will be disappointed, as there is nothing in the area of applications. Exercises are included at the end of the chapters but no solutions are included.This book is not one that I would consider using in a course in abstract algebra. So many applications have developed since it was published and using those applications is a way to solidly reinforce the principles of abstract algebra."
1,Not a DVD audio disk,"This was misrepresented as a DVD audio disk. It it a 24/96 DAD, but will not work in DVD Audio players, such as teh Levinson Acura systems."
1,Probably not worth buying,"Some good information, but the idiosyncratic style really got in the way. It's like reading a book written for the author, not for readers."
1,thigh belt,"I was very unimpressed with these slimmer belts. It is actually two neoprene ""belts"" with velcro that you fasten around each leg. Exactly like the waist belt if you have used one of those, just smaller. The velcro rubs if you don't fasten it just so, and it is impossible to get them around the problem areas...saddlebags. Next time I will buy the whole short, should be much better."
3,This toy is made for kids,This popped up in a search for something else. I'm putting together a costume and thought these could be fun. The text says for kids but the model in the photo looks like an adult so I thought I would try them.These are for kids. The earpiece ends in front of my ear. I may still use them but I would not have purchased them if I realized how short they are.
2,Sounded better than actual,I was pretty disappointed in the quality of the planetarium toy. The comet laser is lame. The stars did not work very well in my child's bedroom maybe because of the strange shape of his ceiling.
1,Uncle Milton Star Theater,Please Read and believe in the previous reviews. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it's completely terrible Hunk of Plastic JUNK! We will be returning it to ToysRUs!!!
2,Disappointed,I expected this book to be a lot larger. Full of much more information. It's not. I would not recommend it. You can find much more information just surfing the net.
3,Diabetic Guide,"This is a great little book, BUT it is not what I specifically needed. I was looking for a different type of book that would count other things and not just have exchanges in it. I also don't use a lot of the foods listed and some that I do use are not in it. It just wasn't what I need, but I am sure to someone else, it would be a great asset."
5,The Official Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges,"Excellent guide, especially for a newly diagnosed diabetic who wants to follow the recommended diabetic diet. I highly recommend!"
4,EASY & HELPFUL,This little pocket book is a great help for someone who has recently been diagnosed with diabetes. It is easy to read and easy to keep close at hand when you need help to make good choices.
5,Very convenient reference,"This is a very handy little reference ASSUMING you are planning your meals around diabetic exchanges and don't already know how most foods are classified and what their serving sizes are. Yes, the information is on the internet and you can find it, copy it, reformat it, print it out, and carry around your own little wad of paper, or you can buy this tidy little booklet and move on to more important things."
1,Diabetic Pocket Guide,"Truthfully, this book is so thin that it is a waste of $5.95...Go to the library and check out something similar for free and photocopy what you need...I will never use the book I bought -- same info is readily available online and elsewhere."
1,not worth the money,This little booklet is not even worth the money or the time to read it. Should be given away for free as a gift for buying something else.
3,Helped some what,"Expected a much larger book for the price, but info was good to apply for reason I purchased it."
2,whatever,"This book is not very helpful. The information, once it has been learned---ELSEWHERE--or, far away, long ago, on a distant planet---I can't imagine anyone needing this kind of help to do these conversions."
1,"diabetic help, not","I have to say that I was a bit set back when I received this booklet,The Official Pocket Guide for Diabetics. I was expecting something a bit more helpful for someone who had just been diagnosed with Diabetes.I suppose that it is ok, but would not recommend paying more than a couple of dollars for this product.I wound up going to another bookstore and purchasing a much more concise and helpful book."
4,Nods to the past,"This is a terrific new Entombed album. Apparently its a concept album with the main theme being deceit. It has a lot of leanings toward different types of metal and some of the old school fans will appreciate it, but its not Left Hand Path.Listen to it a few times and you'll hear some death and roll, some black metal and some old school death metal. Less rock and punk than some of the recent past, it is the best since Wolverine Blues. Check it out. I love it like you love Jesus."
3,Old and new.,"This album sounds like the old Entombed that I've been missing since the singer went Christian. Wolverine Blues is the greatest thing they'll ever create. It's evil, loud, and yes, rocks. It's Death Metal whether you want to admit it or not. What you should be buying is Death Breath. The drummer from Entombed other band. They'll show you how to die old school.Stinking Up the NightLet It Stink"
4,Welcome back Entombed,"In the early 90's Entombed was one of death metal's most promising new acts. Their debut LP ""Left Hand Path"" is a landmark record for the 90's and one of death metal's most powerful debut. Their sophomore release ""Clandestine"" was even stronger than the previous. It was faster, heavier, and just all around better. After that came one of the most disappointing releases in metal history ""Wolverine Blues"" which featured a Marvel Wolverine Comic in the original LP. This was an experimental album in which Entombed incorperated a more rock 'n' roll element in their songs and thus dubbed it ""death 'n' roll"". The album was a big disgrace, and Entombed stayed in this direction for all of their albums, until Serpent Saints. This album is not Clandestine, but its getting there. It has a lot of the early Left Hand Path riffs, as well as some of the death 'n' roll. Entombed finally made a metal record after all these years, and it is definitely worth a listen."
5,Safe way for toddlers to get on the potty by themselves,"Our daughter could not get on the potty by herself before we bought this. We have the Baby Bjorn step stool but she is not coordinated enough to get on it, turn around and sit down. The potty stool is great because it is stable and has handles for her to hold on to while she turns around. It is pricey but I think worth it."
2,"Too bulky and heavy, ok for daycares","This is a great stool for a daycare, but it is large and a little too heavy for a home environment. It is difficult to store and heavy to move from one location to the next despite that it is hollow insite. I love that it had handles, but still returned it because it just was too much. It also has the name written ""potty stool"" written across the stool where everyone can see it. In the return I wasted only 7 dollars, but overall they compensated me the rest and that was good."
3,"Too big, had to return it","This idea and concept is totally awesome. However, the item is just way too bulky and big. I would love to have found one that is smaller and can fit in a smaller toilet area. We did return it and the company was helpful in our return process. Of course, we had to pay for shipping which was $50. This item is expensive but totally worth it if it wasn't so big. We were disappointed."
4,Excellent product,"The only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is the price. I do think it is overpriced. That being said, I have had mine for 3 years with no issues. It cleans easily, is very heavy and sturdy, easy to assemble, and I don't have to move it to use the toilet. I just wish the price would come down as I would like to add a second one to another bathroom."
4,Makes the potty possible...,"We bought this for my younger son who has some limited movement and needed extra help and security at the potty. For us, this was the best kid-sized stool out there for the bathroom."
5,"Just Buy It! Really, it's worth it.","I've had mine for 2 years. Both kids potty trained by the time they were 2, a boy and a girl. Not only has it saved us $$$ in diapers but we are paying the ""potty-trained 3yr old"" rate at her preschool instead of the ""diapered 2yr"" rate because she doesn't require diapers. That alone is a $85 savings a month! The school director asked me what my secret was...this potty stool and a 3-in-1 potty seat made by Bemis. Just bite the bullet and buy it. Bonus...you won't have to wash a single toy potty if you just go this route!"
5,Safe & Sturdy,"This product is well worth its price. It's safe, sturdy and easy to clean. While it is large it does tuck nicely into the toilet and if you're of average size/weight you don't have to worry about removing the handles to sit on the toilet as an adult."
3,Misleading description,"I was searching for a book on introducing numbers in SPANISH to my child. The online description reads as though this is an English-Spanish book, however, to my surprise, it is FRENCH and English! If I were looking to teach French to my child this would be a fine intro, but I was misled and disappointed."
4,Overall good purchase,"1) Stylish2) Tad fragile.. although aluminum but if dropped on hard surface it may dent.3) The actual capacity is around 950ml not 1000 ml (1.0 litre). You cannot fill up to the brim.4) If you fill up water from one of those water fountains at ur work, the bottle becomes too cold to hold. I always need to fill up hot water from the coffee maker machine to neutralize the chilled effect."
2,***2.5 STARS......HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.....***********,"Hard to believe that the same person who penned the amazingly successful and entertaining Shopaholic series also wrote this staggeringly boring piece. The story revolves around a family who have vacated their beloved home to pursue their dreams of running a tutorial college....only to find themselves drowning under a mountain of debt. And while Liz and Jonathan struggle with how to keep their heads above water, Liz strikes a friendship with a successful--and handsome--real estate agent. One thing leads to another and soon the viability of the entire business falls to the seemingly timid and clueless Jonathan. Meanwhile, their daughter Alice develops a relationship with the renters that have moved into her old house....once they've discovered her lurking about. Lives become inextricably intertwined, and betrayals surface as the story heads to a dry, anti-climactic conclusion."
1,Disappointing,"I always enjoy Madeleine Wickham's writing but this was fell quite shirt of my expectations. It was dull, uninteresting and predictable."
1,Boring Book,"I have read only one other Madeleine Wickham book, The Gatecrasher, and I enjoyed it. This one was absolutely awful. By chapter 4, I just put it down. There were too many main characters and nothing going on. No drama, no conflict, no humor, just people going about their day. Not my kind of book at all."
3,Easy to put down,"Let's just say I've been reading ""A Desireable Residence"" for months. The book has yet to really entice me to finish it. I've gotten other books and easily put this one away to read later.I really wanted to love this book, the premise is so good... but it just hasn't held my attention. I think my least favorite character is the teen child Alice who is so boring to read, I find myself just putting the book down and going to sleep. I wish I could give it a better review, but I just don't feel compelled or even interested enough to finish."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I downloaded the audio version of this book about a month ago and have yet to finish it. I have restarted it several times because I feel like with the positive reviews I've been reading, there is something I am missing. I have read all of Wickham/Kinsella's books and have never been as disappointed as I am with this one. It jumps around from one character to another without allowing the reader to get ""to know"" each one. I just don't get it."
1,Horribly Depressing,"I am a fan of Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Every storyline was extremely depressing and most of the characters seemed to have a lot of hatred, especially the children. I don't mind reading a depressing book if it seems to serve a purpose, but if there is a purpose to this particular book, I didn't see it. The only reason I continued reading till the end was because I love the author and I thought this book would have to turn around at some point, but it just ended, without any of the characters having any type of closer. I am extremely disappointed to say the least."
1,I'll stick to the Shopaholic Series,"With the success of the Shopaholic Series, the books that Sophie Kinsella wrote previously are being reprinted. In this case, that's not a very good thing. I was disappointed in this book, I found the characters to be recycled and the plot unrealistic. To re-affirm what other readers have been saying - this was truly an undesirable residence!"
1,Worst Wickham Book,"I have read all the Shopaholic series books and most of the other Wickham books and I am huge fan of Madeline Wickham. I love her writing style and her witty humor in her other books. This was not like any of her other books; This book is not funny, not witty, and has no likeable characters. I kept on reading thinking that the characters would grow more likeable, or at least more humorous; I was wrong on both counts. The characters were not likeable and their actions only made them more deplorable and/or boring."
3,"Not bad, not great","If you're looking for a little chic lit or a break from heavy reading, this is the book for you. Like her other stuff, it's got a lot of frolic and fun, with a very thin layer of dark, serious undertoning. I liked it, but I wouldn't bother going to see the movie."
2,Major disappointment,"I am a huge fan of all Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella books, but I have to say that this was one of the dumbest books I have ever read. The characters were all boring and frankly, I couldn't wait for it to end!"
3,Not Wickham's best work,"This book was a fun read. However, I've read many of her books and this wasn't her best. The ending could have used a lot more development. It's as if she was up against a deadline and just decided to stop writing. That was disappointing, but overall, if you are a fan of her work, I would definately still read it."
3,M Wickham fan,This book was not one of her best. I had to push myself to read this one. The characters were not as interesting as characters in her other books.
4,"A good, but not a NEW book...","I was so excited when I thought that Madeleine Wickham (Sophie Kinsella) had a new book coming out! I've read all of her books and am a big fan. That's why I was SO confused as to why they claimed that this was a new book published in 2010 when it was actually published in 2006! Besides the initial letdown of already having read this book, it is a good read...quite perfect for the summer. I like Wickham's books over Kinsella's (I know it's the same person), however the characters are a lot more flawed in the books she writes as Wickham, rather than the saccharine sweet characters in her Shopaholic series. If you didn't read it back in '06 I would definitely give it a read this time a round!"
3,A slice of life.,"This book was fun but had a bit of a gloomy aftertaste. The main characters, Liz and Jonathan, were a middle-aged married English couple. They had recently made a sudden change of life by buying a tutorial school and moving into the tiny flat above the school. Their teenage daughter, Alice, was bereft at the loss of the only home she had ever known. Thus, Alice took to smoking cigarettes in the garage of her former home. She continued sneaking into the garage even after the house was rented out until she was discovered by the new occupants. This discovery further connected the lives of the house's owners, the new occupants, the real estate agent and his family. Throughout the book, everyone had some incredible connection to everyone else. Everyone was sneaking around somewhere, too.While the characters were complicated and colorful, the story itself seemed forced and contrived."
3,"Light, Fun, Excellent Beach Reading","I had previously only read Wickham as Sophie Kinsella, and I've enjoyed most of those books. I've previously found Kinsella/Wickham to be humorous and capable of telling a fun and fast-moving story. I found those things to be true of this book. The story centers on a house in a suburban English town, rented by its owners to a glamorous London couple. It's very important to recognize what this book is, and what it is not. This is chick lit, a light and fun read. One should not expect deep layers of meaning, or transcendent messages about the nature of humanity. What this is is a fast read that will keep the reader in light entertainment for a few hours. I wouldn't want my reading list to consist entirely of books like this, but every now and then such books are a nice diversion."
1,a wonderful CD of music,"Parade magazine recommended this CD. It is so fabulous! 5 little monkeys is our favorite song- my daughter (almost 2) always requests ""monkey song""- and is elated every time she hears it. My husband and I also enjoy listening to it. I highly recommend it to anyone! We also bought the sing-a long CD- that's wonderful too."
5,Stays in the CD player,"Like the other reviewers, we LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD. Nice variety, fun lyrics, great tempo, and the songs don't drive adults insane on the nine hundredth playing. Probably our favorite ""kid"" CD - even among the other Putumayo albums. Top choice for gift to new parents, kids birthday, etc. You really can't go wrong buying it."
4,Won't Drive You Crazy!!,"I work at a place that plays kids music on loop all...day...long. There are many, many CDs which are ridiculously annoying, and that I would happily snap in half and never listen to another minute of. When its my turn to push play, I always, without exception, turn to Putumayo Kids, and Animal Playground is my new favorite. These songs are clever, fun, and a few tracks sound like things I might listen to myself on my off hours, like selections from the Be Good Tanyas (The Littlest Birds) and Terri Hendrix (Eagles).If you would like to expose the children in your life to something quality, fun and entertaining, while keeping your precious sanity intact, I would recommend this CD especially. Also try Sing Along With Putumayo."
5,Animal Playground is sure to delight young animal lovers,"The latest in the award-winning Playground music CD series, Animal Playground: Playful Music Tracks from Around the World is an album offering a multilingual collection of animal-themed songs from around the world. Filled with hootin', hollerin', family-friendly musical fun, the songs are by a wide variety of artists and include call-and-response music, folklore from around the globe, and energizing beats young people will want to jump, hop, and sing to. The tracks are Animal Crackers, No More Monkeys, Nella Vecchia Fattoria, Aves, The Littlest Birds, The Three Bears, Cantiga do Sapo, L'Otorhinoceros, Bigi Kaiman, Don't Ever Step on a Snake, Eagles, If a Dinosaur Was My Friend, and Mbube. Drawing on musical traditions from nations as diverse as Trinidad, France, Netherlands, Brazil, South Africa, and much more, Animal Playground is sure to delight young animal lovers and is the perfect souvenir of a trip to the zoo."
5,Our favorite cd for our 9-month old,"I purchased several copies of this cd at Costco (sorry Amazon) while pregnant one year ago. I gave two cd's to my nephews and saved the third cd for our baby due March 2010. I had not heard any of the music on the cd prior to my purchase, but had high hopes since I already owned several of the Putomayo music cd's for adults (from Amazon :). I am SO glad that I hung on to that third cd for our future baby because ever since the first time that we listened to the cd while building our baby's crib, my husband and I were completely hooked from the very first song. Our baby is now 9 months old and clearly recognizes all of the songs because he claps and smiles whenever we turn on this music. There is only one warning and that is that pretty much all the songs on the cd are addictive and you'll find yourselves singing them to yourself often. (Our nephews love the cd too.)"
1,Disappointing,"This is a low quality, uninspired book. The dishes are obvious & bland, considering the subject matter. Not even the black bean recipe is useful . . . Go elsewhere for cuban cuisine."
2,A little disappointed.,"After reading the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with this product. The padding isn't all that thick, and the straps are a little short to go around the seat of my Old Towne. My butt still goes numb after a while in me canoe, but not as fast as without it.I have molded seats, so it doesn't work as well probably as it would with flat cane seats."
2,pain in the backside,Come on ryobi can't you engineer a table saw that is easier to repair? If not then you should at least have more repair facilities in the markets that you sell this product. Shipping a table saw for repair 300 miles is not an option. One must take the whole thing apart just to replace the v belts(plural). Why are there 2 belts when 1 wide one would do the trick? And lastly the price is outrageous. After 5 hours of disassembley and reassembly the unit now works perfectly. Not sure it was worth the effort. Next time I will be looking at the Dewalt.
5,"Readable, concise, enjoyable - and it works!","Dr. Tom Amberry and Philip Reed have provided us with the key to success at free throw shooting. This book is easy to read - I provided it to middle and junior high school boys at my basketball camp. The text is concise and enjoyable, filled with important lessons that can help in basketball and in life. Dr. Amberry teaches us how to focus and concentrate on the process not the results. This is something that is important to players, coaches, and to each of us in our lives. For those that need additional support, Dr. Amberry's video ""Make Every Free Throw"" provides his lessons in an excellent visual format. As a coach and teacher, I would and do highly recommend ""Free Throw"" to everyone. It is the most influential book in my coaching career. Not only do his ideas make sense- they work!"

4,Magic Treehouse on Steroids,"My son read this book for a book report at school in the 3rd grade. He loved it. It's the next step for readers who enjoyed the Magic Treehouse series, but need more description and action. His book report was a map report. It was amazing how much he remembered and in the order it happened. We originally found the 3rd book in the series and started to read it....but realized we really needed to start at the beginning. It was hard to find...we had to get a major bookstore to order the 4 book series for us......it's an interesting book written by an Italian author about three children in England."
4,The Mystery Door,"a)A person that would enjoy this book is a person who loves to explore and loves mystery.b)I thought that the protagonist was very infantile. Jason acts before he think. He plays around with dangerous things and jumps in an unknown place.c)I thought that the book was okay. It would been great if the book had more action. If it did, then I would have taken care of it like a new born baby."
1,Stay Away!,"I would like to give this publication a Zero but it won't allow me to. This is one of those books that really did not need to be written. It is utterly featureless. It is comprised of bland writing, recycled source material, and lackluster illustrations. I didn't learn anything from reading this page-turner.lol Anyone with half of an imagination and slightly familiar with America in the 1920's should not buy this book. It offers nothing new to the Cthulhu Mythos."
3,Pretty Cute!,"A stuffed animal doesn't have much value other than in the eyes of his beholder. But my 8-year old granddaughter thought he was pretty cute! He is smaller than we imagined, but sits nicely on a toy shelf with his ""girlfriend"" Tiptoes Touche Starlet Shimmerella. They are well finished, have some nice extra touches (like soft, feathery tails) and are loaded with personality. These two are stars who are never asked to perform -- all they have to do is sit there and look great!"
1,low quality components,"I bought this bike for my son for his commute between his dorm and his classes on campus. I was looking for something inexpensive, since bikes get stolen all the time on the campus. I was very disappointed with the quality of the components on this bike. Granted that I was not expecting a top quality bike for around $120, however, I was expecting at least the wheels would be true! The front wheel was so out of true, that the brake pads would grab the wheel. After trying to true the front wheel, I tried adjusting the cable on the front brake, but it was no use. Got to a point that I had to pay 10% price of the bike and buy a pair of descent brake pads to replace the existing ones. I would say, the price on this bike should be $40 since the components are all lowest possible quality."
1,real comment,This was a great seller. But the product didn't do anything. You have to take 12 pills for a dosage. I would pass on this product. It just didn't do anything.
2,Hype,"Despite the generous humour found within, this is probably NOT the book you want to get if you need to find out particular data on your Jeep. The book seems to focus on common sense issues related to 4X4's in general, so it leaves much to be desired in terms of identifying axles, transmissions, transfer cases and the like. Oh yeah, there aren't any wiring diagrams included. I suppose the book was written on the premise that the reader should already know what s/he has in and around their Jeep...which, in a sense, kinda relegates the book to owner's manual status rather than being a bible on the subject. The Haynes manuals are much better."
3,It's like talking to a crusty old guy,"I'm new to Jeeps and am rebuilding a thrashed 79 CJ 7. This book was helpful at first with some things I would not have thought of. But pretty quickly I was opening it up and not finding anything helpful. I couldn't find any insight into my current axle issue, in fact nothing on my Dana 44's out of an 86 CJ.So what do you get? A lot of common sense rambling from a guy who has been working on Jeeps since 1944. It's a good story with some interesting advice but in my opinion, not worth the money or the time."
5,best pans I ever used,"I have been a Chef for about 13years now and to this day I still love these pans, I makes cooking so much easier when you have such even heat source. I have read other reviews and the biggest complaint was they are hard to clean up. My opinion is simple, Love Them and Treat them well and They will do the same for you"
1,Owned Calphalon for nearly 7 years - Own All-Clad now,"I began purchasing Calphalon cookware the year before I got married, and we have used it as our primary cookware for nearly 7 years for our now family of 4. However, over time my most used pots no longer have the anondized exterior but now have a shiny silver interior. After all of the expense invested in the cookware we are very disappointed. I love to cook and cook a lot and have decided to rid my kitchen of the calphalon and we now own the All-Clad stainless set which as an extra bonus is dishwasher safe. Hopefully, the All-Clad will perform better than the Calphalon did. I will never purchase anything other than stainless in the future."
2,Short Changed,"I think the cookware is good, however, I ordered it for a gift and when it was opened it was missing the 1 1/2 qt. sauce pan. I have made several attempts to get this corrrected and as of today 3-15-04 no response from Amazon.com."
1,"stay away, not worth $10","I really wanted these pots for xmas and was happy when I received them but now I wish I had chosen something else.Simply, these pots look like crap after less than a year.I have to one day return 2 of them and demand they are replaced, and to return them I have to UPS them off to the middle of no where. These pots aren't light so I'm sure the UPS bill will be as heafty as the pots.I've seen better results with $10 pots from Sears.Go with someone else like AClad."
2,Markings too distracting,"It was difficult to read because every page was heavily underlined, with inane comments in the margins. ( for example,""Euuuw"" or ""Groooossss"") I found this to be very distracting."
4,Excellent Reading,"The daunting effort of reading books for school was put to an end when I read House of the Spirits. It is a terrific book, that can appeal to those both young and old. Usually a reader of mostly crime and investigative novels, I found Isabelle Allende to be a great and powerful writer, and I have used her as an inspiration to continue and further my own writing skills. House of the Spirits, spans across four generations and is much better than the movie, and it is amazing how a story of political hardship could also involve a love story. Isabelle Allende was able to show me the harshness of the political revolt and in complete contrast, the magic and surrealism that can happen throughout the worst of times."
3,A for effort...,"The story is worth telling, but the style is awkward. Allende is much too enamored with her characters for the reader to take them seriously. The House of the Spirits is a good read for school aged or (very) occasional adult readers. It is certainly not for anyone who has read (and liked) any Gabriel Garcia Marquez books. Allende's grip on magical realism is tenuous. When employed correctly, magical realism has an otherworldly effect on the reader: it forces the reader out of his/her reality and thrusts him/her into the depths of the tale. Everything else becomes irrelevant and the reader is completely engrossed. Bumpy transitions and insipid descriptions prevent Allende from casting a magical spell. This is unfortunate. Allende seems to have great vision for the story in her mind, but she is unable to project it on paper."
4,Great Book for Literature Lovers,"My first reaction after reading the first chapter of this book is that it felt very similar (in style) to Gabriel Garcia Marquez.I wanted to say it is full myth and Latin America history but then when I thought about the story I realized that myth and magic is part of Latin America which is one of the points that Allende repeats throughout her great story. This explains the similarity in style with Marquez since he also portrays Latin America.I like Allende's style, she keeps the reader engaged throughout the book and leaves something to the imagination by not dwelling too much on the details.The story is great and it is basically the history of Chile through the life of one family that never sees a dull moment.I highly recommend this book.Note: There is a movie based on this book (it has the same title). I would recommend reading the book first then watching the movie just to see how your imagination fairs next to the director's."
3,Not Allende's best,"Entertaining and great plot and characters, but not Allende's best. I preferred Luna for the spirituality and mysticism, and Daughters of Fortune for the characters and plot. Still, it's worth reading and I would recommend it. Just don't judge her by this book alone. If this is the only one of her books you've read, I highly recommend picking up Daughters of Fortune. That's a must-read-book."
1,Not Worth It,"A friend suggested I read this book before leaving for Chile, where the story takes place. While the story is okay, despite the supernatural aspects, the accuracy is off. Allende's very socialist views are prominent throughout the story, leaving some misinformation for the reader. To really find out what went on during this important time during Chilean period, read an unbiased book of this history. All in all, not a horrible story, but a bad perception."
3,The House of Spirits,"I was required to read this book for my english class, and personally, I did not like it. Originally, I thought that the book was going to be about a house full of spirits, but before I read the novel, my teacher explained that it is a novel about class struggle and politics in Chile. However, after reading the book I have come to disagree. The book is really a flash back into the lives of its characters and is full of their personal stories and adventures. To me, these stories due to their graphic nature overshadow the class issues and the politics. It is not that they are not apparent, but that they are overshadowed by the gruesome acts of rape and other digusting things that should have been left out of the book. Also, to me the book becomes very monotonous. At certain parts I felt like the book was going to end, and yet I still had more than 100 pages to go. In the end I find that the rape and violence in this book overshadow its original purpose and thus degrade its value."
1,Don't read this book,"This book was not only the most disgusting book I have ever read, but also the most plot less uninteresting story. Any issues this story displays can be found in many much better books."
2,Bad Philosophy,This book has a vein of communism coarsing through it that was so repugnant that it was difficult to finish.
1,An Escape from Real Life,"I thought this book was truly an escape from real life, and I do not mean this positively. I do not understand what goes through the minds of people to write like this. The entire book is very unrealistic and cynical of life."
2,"A parade of strong, passionate, beautiful women","How many can you take?! And they all do the same thing. An in depth look at one of them would be enough. I don't care which, they were all essentially the same character. The repetitive cyclical nature of this plot got so tedious. I didn't care enough about any of the characters and the political struggle was dull and depressing. The use of the supernatural was interesting, though, and the novel is certainly ambitious although i would say its reach exceeds its grasp. This book is a long and exhausting load of ideas that should have been shortened and refined."
4,Complex,"This is a great book. Definitely for those who are into emotional stories. You get tears at the romances that could never be. However, has anybody noticed that Alba, Blanca's child, spent her childhood reading at the age of five, and could read her Uncle Marco's book? Then she grows up and becomes close to her grandmother. Her grandmother(Clara) tells Alba the stories that Clara had learned from Uncle Marco's book. Pretty ironic isn't it? Only read the book one time and it hit me. For those new readers, see if you can spot it."
4,My thoughts on the house of spirits,"I thought that Isabel Allende's book The House of Spirits was a pretty good book to read. Im not a fan of reading much, but when I was given the assignment of reading this novel by my english teacher, I couldn't stop reading it . It's the story of a woman with supernatural powers, her male tart of a husband, and their stuggles with each other, their daughter, sister in law, and political issues. I really thought that this novel was worth reading and maybe you will enjoy it too!"
5,house of Spirits,Great book which I had read many years ago. it was great to see the evolution of a revolution considering the current situation in the Middle East
1,uggghhhh,"I had to read this book for IB english as apart of our program. The book started out very interesting with dynamic characters whom I had never read any close to. (Meaning the characters were unique). The problem is THEY NEVER CHANGED. There was no character development or any lessons learned (Except on the VERY last page). The worst part is, characters just died. Their deaths would just stick ou like a sore thumb, as if allende were trying to get rid of old characters to make room for new ones. Another problem: TOO MANY CHARACTERS TO KEEP TRACK OF. There were WAAAY more characters in this novel than what I deemed ""necessary"" most held no link to the plot at all (also: NO PLOT).I felt as if this book was a biography of a family that had been fictionalized.Needless to say: Awful book that only intellectuals would enjoy to read."
1,Derivative Chick Lit Slop,"I judge this smarmy mash to be about 75% Garcia Marquez and 25% Jorge Amado.Summary-Man bad. Man dumb. Man favorite profession- likable but stupid father, unlikable rapist fascist father, parasite, pedophile, one dimensional campasino, crazed priest...Woman good. Woman smart. Woman nurturing. Woman magical, deep, loving, tolerant, ...ad nauseam.Subplot-Capitalism evil.Socialism good.The only thing more depressing than contemplating the popularity of this novel is thinking about all the money Allende made from this."
1,ew,"This was probably one of the worst books I have read thus far in my existence. Wow. There was ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT. Many of the people I collaborated with while reading this book said, ""well life is a plot, isn't it?"" NO IT'S NOT. LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE. Why does anyone need to waste their time with this travesty of a story? Magical realism is the worst writing style I can imagine. One of the main principles of magical realism is that time is nothing. But I doubt you would say that as in the time that you can read this book, which is quite a while considering there is random rambling for around 400 pages, you could have done every chore imaginable that you need done in your house, and saved the world three times. Either something was lost in translation from spanish to english, or this was the most poorly written book in the history of fiction...or anything."
1,Abhorrent,"This book is:A) Poorly writtenB) Poorly TranslatedC) Poorly devisedD) Poor over allThe ""plot"" is reminiscent of something seen on ""Televido"" at four in the afternoon. The whole thing is violently politically scewed, being based around the evil of anyone not a socialist.Allende never once mentions the thousands of atrocities and mass murders perpetrated by the socialist government, and also fails to point out the fact that Chile blossomed into a technologically advanced country competetitive in the world market under its facist dictatorship.It's grotesque, as well. I don't think any of the characters survive the book without being raped at some point, and homosexuality is encouraged as being noble.The characters are all horribly sterotypical archetypes. The idea that this sort of literary musak is considered ""classic literature"" and forced upon impressionable students in high school.My advice to all students out there: Refuse to read this book en masse. Your teacher won't fail all of you."
5,"""House of Spirits"" captures heart and mind","""House of the Spirits"" is a poignant, enterprising story that challenges the reader's concept of love, power and struggle. With the presence of the clairovayant nature of the book's most influential female characters, the issue of feminism and the differences in power sources are explored. However, many of the situations can be applied to anyone's life and compared to the surprising, sometimes difficult to swallow reactions of the characters, such as the magnitude of forgiveness. Even rather crude situations that are described reveal basic qualities of the human soul. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to divulge themselves into a quality literary work that transports the reader into a world of tribulations that leads to an ultimate triumph."
5,Fantastic.,"I also had to read this book as part of the IB curriculm, and I had heard it's reputation and was not looking forward to it. But when I got into it I discovered a depth in the characters, a fluid transition from one generation to another, and a political debate that was intriguing. This does not mention the internal debate as to whether the sexual material was required. I believe it was to give the book the truth of human nature."
3,"good, but not great","I liked this book, but I didn't know whether it was an exercise in magical realism or a social commentary. If it was the latter, it was pretty good, but if it was the latter, there are half a dozen authors writing now who do it much better (like Garcia Marquez)."
5,"True classic, rich with South American culture.","Since this book signifies what all Latin American countries have gone through it prejects it's people and the strength they get through it. The book gives you an idea that it could be Chile, yet it felt like Peru me being from there."
1,Two Hundred Years of Solitude,"Could ""The House of the Spirits"" be the greatest rip-off in the history of literature?It's like Allende read ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" one day and thought, ""You know, I really like this story and the way that it's written, except that there's not enough socialism and female empowerment in it. Hmmm...I KNOW, I think I'll REWRITE IT to include more of these aspects and change the characters' and places' names and the title so people will think it's my own book."" Well, she did it. It's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" all over again, more politically-correct and less well-written.And now this book is studied in the prestigious International Baccalaureate English program by the smartest and most motivated high school students. It's a sign of the times, where books like this and ""Mother to Mother"" by Sindiwe Magona are studied over genuine classics in the name of political correctness."
4,Danielle's Opinion on this book,I think that this book was a different look at a different culture. It taught you how life was back then and at the same time it it kept your interest by putting a love story in with it. I would recomend this book to anyone in high school or older because of some graphic parts.
5,Excellent Work,"I just wanted to clarify that the United States CIA was behind the death of President Salvador Allende and that he did not commit suicide. He was murdered. He was also democratically elected. As a result of US involvement, the Coup was successful and is why Pinochet was able to assume power and commit mass murders from 1973 until 1990. Thanks to the United States government and military, millions of people died at the hands of the ruthless Pinochet. When the book ends, it is Pinochet who is beginning his reign of terror that would later be described by historians as the Dirty War. While Pinochet is responsible for his actions, the United States is also responsible for this by facilitating the process of the Coup and subsequently supporting and recognizing the dictatorship as the official government of Chile. Based on this and many other instances of US intervention, I am ashamed to be a citizen of the United States."
4,An Entertaining Novel,"I thought that the story was quite entertaining. Allende provided a great vivid description of South America. I thought that at points the mystical part of the book went overboard, however I do believe that over all it was a great story. I highly recommend it."
4,"Love, Revenge and Magic","I read this book as a required text when I studied in Madrid, Spain and was so intrigued that I read it twice, once in spanish. This outstanding novel brings together the realism of the turmoil in Chile with the mysticism of Allende's imagination. This novel follows a wealthy Chilean family through three generations with underlying themes of love and revenge with an added twist of magic. The setting changes form their urban mansion to the serene home in the country, where the main man constructed a village over a number of years and generations. Basically, love conquers all, end of story. The downside: it can get a bit confusing at times becasue several of the characters have the same names, and there are many spanish words in the english version. Overall, this was a beautifully written book. By far, Allende's best novel."
2,Just a copycat of Garcia Marquez,"Was Isabel Allende intention to write another ""One hundred years of solitude""? It happened to me that I read those two books back to back. Allende changed a little bit the plot, the names and some characters and voila, the other big novel of the Spanish American literature. Not a big deal, in my opinion. Still, the work is captivating and sometimes original, but not as a whole."
5,Good book,"This is the first book I've read by this author. It's really good, very descriptive, very well-written. It was in good shape and arrived quickly, too."
4,Allende spins colorful web,I found Isabel Allende's House of the Spirits to be a colorful depiction of a not-so-typical family in a place that strongly resembles but is not referred to as Chile. Allende's entertaining inclusion of magical realism weaves a colorful web that both capture's the reader's attetion and proves thematically significant. I especially applaud Allende in her usage of feminism and Marxism as side-plots. They tickle the reader's fancy without becoming to overbearing. Overall I found this book to be a racing car through the fantasy of the mind.
4,Allende does it again,"When an author is able to take a far-fetched idea and pull it together into a plausible story, I'm usually smitten. Call me smitten. Isabel Allende builds a beautiful, dramatic tale of spirits, powers, family and love into The House of Spirits. She chronicles the life of her ancestors and their mystical powers in a tale that's heartbreaking as well as uplifting. Only Allende has been able to carry off this combination, in my opinion.The story is strong, if not a tad too long. In typical Allende style, the book is wrapped in beautiful, poetic description. It's a strong showing by a strong author."
4,great book Erin D.,The House of Spirits is such a great book. The more you read the book the more you feel like you are right there watching everything as it takes place. this is a well written book and i would reconmend it to others.
4,Great Book!,"Love the book and would recommend it to anyone. Not as good as the Daughter of Fortune book, because it does get a little stale in middle with the descriptions of each generation character, but definitly worth the read. I can't wait to compare it to the movie."
5,House of Spirits,"House of spirits is a great book. It shows the value of haveing a family. The book is very descriptive and easy to understand. My favorite part of the book is that their is many narrators in the story which makes you wonder who the narrator is at that time. I would recomend this book to anyone, House of Spirits is one of the best books I have ever read."
3,Morgan King's review,The House of Spirits is a well written book that gave you alook at the world in a different light. It actually discuses the stateof certain countries in the world. It was well writen but somewhat long. Isabella does a wonderful job at keeping the reader intrigued.
3,Have I read this before?,"This book is a very good read. I enjoyed it from start to finish. I have just one problem with it. It follows the basic line of 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Márquez only varied with twists that could have been taken from a ""What modern feminine Latin authors need to succeed"" brochure. The book offers nothing new for the development of Latin Identity. If you are looking for an entertaining, well-written book this book will work well. If you would like to explore why many claim that Latin America is producing some of the the most innovative and thought provoking works of our times, look to Márquez, Borges or Cortázar and others."
4,* I would like to give this 4.5 stars,"Allende has created a marvelouse book with a style quite different from most other authors. The story takes the reader through three generations of a single family. The wonderful and beautiful way Allende has composed this culturally enhancing and ""unable to put down"" book is really marvelouse. The one downfall is ""Clara the Clairvoyant"" sometimes turns dissapointingly unrealistic as well as her mothers ability to contact the spirtual world (which is only one aspect of the book and should not be viewed as a turn-off). If you're simply looking for a good book and if you're not too skeptical of a person - I suggest reading ""House of Spirits"". ~15 yrs."
5,the house of spirits,"this book is eye opening and amazing. it bridges the gap between past and preset, fantasy and reality."
2,Characters with geat potential yet plot unfulfilled,"I was somewhat disappointed with Allende's 'The House of Spirits'. Everything about the book seemed to evoke a sense of great things will come from this writer, but unfortunately I was left wanting. So much untapped potential was made of the characters and yet after reading a while in to the book I realised that this is as far as Allende is going to take them. Why? I was left wondering. This is the first book I've read by this author but I'm not going to let it put me off reading more of her stuff. Perhaps my expectations of the author were too great but I don't think so some how."
2,Hard to understand,I believe this book was hard to understand. I read it in my english class and I could hardly follow along. There is too much description and my least favorite part of the book is with the Civil War. It wasn't very interesting the way Alba disobeyed her father. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
4,A lush exploration of the world of spirits in South America.,"This woman can write! Even translated, her talent blazes. The strength of this work, and others, (particularly Paula), is the wonderful women that it showcases. Exploring these women and their adventures is a joy, just in and of itself. Allende's characters are wonderfully mysterious and lush, and her vision and imagination combine to produce a work that is fresh, inviting, and courageous in scope. This was the first experience with this extremely talented woman, and her later books prove she is certainly not a one-book wonder. This book is about magic and spirits who weave spells, and in masterfully writing about this subject, the author will certainly magically weave her own spell as the pages are read. Savor the experience of being led on an etherial journey, and think about the subject matter. Highly, highly recommended!!"
1,Was I glad when I was finished!,I read this book because it was on a list of the 150 best books of the century picked in a poll run by Library Journal. and I have now read 115 of the 150. This one was a real struggle to get thru. I simply could not get interested in the grotesque and weird characters in this book. I kept hoping the book would get better but I cared as little about the chracters on the last page as when I started. This book was a complete waste for me.
4,interesting,"This is a great book. not only does it teach you about life but about love. this is a interesting book, never a dull moment. i would reconmend this book to others."
2,Another voice heard from,"I am afraid that I must register another opinion. I am aware that I read a book that would be considered ""art"". I am aware that I read a book that attempted to personalize the recent history of a very turbulent country (Chile). Initially I thought of it as something like a popup book that you opened to see many wonders, then closed it and put it back on the shelf with no particular effect on the reader. Lately I have begun to think of it as a Latin American soap opera. I can almost watch it in my mind, the characters running in and out, panting with lust, pantomiming when they were in their silent period, whipping peons, riding horses, flying balloons, crashing cars, having sex in marriage and out, being born, dying, arguing with everyone, pots flying, people flying, curses given, etc. I know two movies, at least, were attempted from this material. I think a conventional Spanish Language Soap Opera would be a more appropriate medium. Not my cup of tea."
2,disappointed second time around,"Read this when first published and was enchanted. Many years later, just couldn't get into it. Passed it along to my niece who wanted a book to read on airplane!"
2,not what I was hoping for,"I brought this book home certain that I was going to fall in love with it. I didn't.I found the characters difficult to like. I found the events from one generation to the next to be repetitive. I was annoyed by the right-left politics of the book. At the end, I found myself liking Esteban better than Alba.I wish I bought something else."
4,Recommended for those who like South American historical fiction,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I read other reviews and many people were disgusted by the mention of certain events in characters' lives, but given the setting and time period of the story, those things occurred. I would recommend this book to others."
4,Wonderful historical fiction,"Isabel Allende's books are all very realistic, but include some elements of magical realism. This book has a little more graphic violence than the others that I have read, but it sticks very closely to the realities of the period in which it is based in history. I highly recommend this book."
3,Adequate,"This seems to be an adequate biography. It highlights key events is Sagan's personal and professional life. Sometimes it seems to digress into other persons and topics, or to be a summary of events in the ""life and times"" of Carl Sagan. On the whole I would say readers would be neither overwhelmed nor ""underwhelmed"" by it."
2,Very disapointing,"For a book that claims to be a biography about Sagan, it contains very little information about the person Carl Sagan. The pages are filled with details about persons that worked with him, and quite a bit about the science he did, but very little about Sagan himself. One cannot avoid the conclusion that Moser and Spangenburg just could not dig up any information on Sagan, except for material they got from the Poundstone biography, to which they frequently refer. I could not finish this book. One gets the impression that they wrote it one afternoon (which is how long it will take you to read this short book). What a disapointment!"
1,A good primer for new Sagan fans.,How is this 31 dollars?!?!?!?!?! Not even the hardcover costs this much! What kind of crazy premium is being charged for this kindle version!?!UPDATE: 6.14.09The price has dropped to a more reasonable 10 dollars. I found the Biography to be very brief and not as in depth as I would like a biography of Carl Sagan to be. Hopefully one day Ann Druyan will remedy this and write a real in depth biography of Carl.
3,Picked the wrong one,"I picked the Fireman because the exact tool set up I wanted was not offered, the Fireman was close, but I did not really want the seatbelt blade.The seatbelt blade adds thickness and weight that I did not want.Both blades were a bit dull out of the box, but took a very good edge.If not for the extra thickness of the ""extra"" blade I would give this knife at least 4 maybe 5 stars.Its just pushing the limits of pocket carry, it would be best to use a belt sheath setup with this one.Its not fast to open or close, but it is a ""one hand knife"" I think this is a knife you should handle in peron before buying, but its a good knife."
1,Poor facsimile,THis is a grand book but the edition was illegible with no indication in the advertisement. I am still looking for a usable copy for research. Fine if you want to see 17th century printing and don't care about the text. Not good indication of this fault.
4,Puny Pirate costume,"Great costume for a toddler. The fit depends on the size of your child. My 16-month old has a long torso with broad shoulders, so the crotch (plastic snaps along the inseams) comes up a bit high and it can be a struggle to get her arms in the sleeves, but it looks great on her. It's comfortable and easy to move in, but it can get hot since its 100% polyester. The booties can stretch but don't expect them to fit over most shoes. The little hat has elastic on the back so it stretches easily. Mom stuff aside, this is such a cute costume!! I liken this to what a pirate captain would wear -- no tears or frayed edges, but some velvet touches, leather shoulder ""epaulettes"" and a nice frilly collar. Great playtime piece."
5,CUTEST PIRATE EVER!!,This is a very cute costume! It was almost too small for my 12 month old. I bought a 12-18mo. size. It was fine for the amount of time he was actually wearing it. He was a cute pirate and we had fun!
4,Very cute but may be irritating,"This costume was adorable on our son but when we first put it on him, he complained for a while about the sleeves. He kept saying ""off, off"". He didn't like the feeling of the stiff satin sleeves and the elastic around the wrist. Otherwise, it worked out fine and he did get over it when he joined the party! It was really cute."
1,This is NOT Complete!,"Avoid this release like the plague-- it skips out over 15 minutes of music to fit on one CD! The track listing for the two volume shsould be:Volume 11 Truth is Marching In2 Our Prayer3 BellsVolume 21 Ghost2 InitiationMy advice is to wait for the ESP-Disk reissue that's supposed to be forthcoming with all the material. If you can't wait, there's another double on Amazon that looks complete."
1,relya sdrawkcab!,"Whoever produced this reissue simply did not notice that, the tape is played backwards for two minutes on track two! This elevates it to a party record status or for use as a listening test. Better to get a 2 cd set from Italy having the entire concert."
5,A classic acoustic folk album,I agree with the two earlier reviews. My favorite folk CD. Plains of Kildare also a great song
5,sublime,"I have seen this CD described on the internet as the best folk album ever recorded, and if I were recommending one celtic CD, this would be it. Brady and Irvine are known for their ability to resurrect fine old songs, and all the songs on this album are about soldiering, arranged with great intelligence and taste. The interplay between Brady's guitar and Irvine's bazouki is terrific, but it is the songs and voices that make this album the standout it is."
2,"Highly repetitive story of magic, swordfighting and politics","Modesitt's style has never been his strong point, but his storytelling skills are impressive. Unfortunately, while full of his usual elements--arguments, force, tense battles, exhausting travels, told at a fast pace--the individual stories have all been told before. The young Secca could just as easily be Anna of the earlier books, and her ever-multiplying enemies seem no different than Anna's in first three books. The male chauvinists still doubt a sorceress's deadliness, and countless enemies are characterized only by their enmity and ambition.There is a minor but unexciting romantic subplot, and a more intersting moral opposition to using magic in warfare--where it can escalate to mass-destruction levels.On the whole, if you've read the earlier Spellsong books, you'll find little new here. If not, start with _The Soprano Sorceress_."
3,"Lather, Rinse, Repeat","I am a long-term fan of Modesitt, having read his material from his earlist days. Unfortunately, this novel, while professionally written, is lacking on so many levels that it is difficult to finish.Yes, Secca is developed as a character... Who is just like the character she replaces, only without the anguish of separation and the difficulty of adaptation.And the world is still nominally the world that we left in Book 3, advanced somewhat in time, but it has broken down as an independent milieu and vaguely resembles Recluce down to the white ships of Sea-Priests, the building of a steam engine and some editorial errors referencing Recluce...And we have the obligatory dull romance... Just like the dull romances found in most of Modesitt's books... Only this time, without a central character I cared for, I found it duller and more obviously contrived than in other series'.If you're a fan of the series, good luck. But don't expect to blown away. This is far from his best work."
2,boring,this book was very interesting. i fell asleep. if you like these kind of book then its a good book.
2,Nothing is Sacred,"I was surprised at the way the author describes her parent's divorce. Since both are still alive, I would imagine that they might regard the telling as too personal and intrusive. Why does the reader need to know, for example, that her mother used the personal ads in a magazine to find a successor for the husband she wanted to leave? Moreover, I wonder why this is even in her book when it has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying theme."
1,Shallow book,"I just want to warn prospective buyers - this book is shallow and not worth the read. My bookgroup and I read this as one of our selections. All of us were excited at first - because several of us had heard the author interviewed on the radio and the interview was very interesting - however, the book itself was disappointing. We came away with no deeper understanding of how someone deals with the very natural feelings of revenge. There was too much information shared about her family conflicts - dialogues with her parents. And it just wasn't interesting. As I said earlier, I was shocked at how shallow this book is considering her subject."
4,I will tell all my family and friends about this one,"This is a wonderful book! The author takes what she (and most readers) would consider a relatively black-and-white concept (revenge) and brings all of us along on her amazing journey, both literally and figuratively. The ultimate realization is that revenge is anything but simple, may not even bring satisfaction, and might not even come about in the form we want it to. If anyone from Hollywood had tried to write that astonishing courtroom scene, they would have flubbed it badly. A terrific read."
1,they CHANGED the packaging !,"They RUINED the product! its now 18.4 oz uses 1 egg and less oil , its made for an 8x8 pan....... HORRIBLE !This USED to be a great product and now it is ruined by some bean counter in corporate no doubt ...... goodbye to this mix."
5,#1 Record fans beware!,"Critical ambivalence to Like Flies on Sherbert often stems from people paying attention to the 60s pop nostalgia of Big Star's #1 Record, and not following Chilton through Radio City's visionary half-collapsing pop (think Pavement), or 3rd's absolute avant-garde disarray (like nothing else). Like Flies on Sherbert is in the same spirit as 3rd, as Chilton becomes fascinated with studio ambience and sloppy amateurism, thus exposing the constituents of rock and pop. It's difficult postmodern rock and roll predating Royal Trux/Pussy Galore's more visceral efforts, but Like Flies on Sherbert affectingly showcases Chilton's personal problems at the time more than any hipster indifference or deconstructionist tendencies. In that way, it's sorta like Neil Young's Tonight's the Night or On the Beach. Intentionally sloppy and incredibly bold.Provided you know what to expect (sloppy amateurism), Like Flies on Sherbert is a fascinating, cathartic avant-garde punk record"
3,A decent effort but was expecting more,"When I first listened to the album, I have to admit I had secondthoughts. The more I listened to it, it kind of grew on me. Chilton takes an idea or concept like ""My Rival"" and gives itan early rock n'roll sound. I mean he even sounds like Buddy Holly in one song. He sings like the singer in the band ""TheClash"" in the song ""Should I stay or should I go."" He combinesstyles that I wasn't expecting. I think his guitar riffs havea recklessness about them; yet they are still entertaining.Chilton is a different kind of rocking. It's like he's mellowwith a rockin' undercurrent."
2,"Scattered, messy production tries to capture spirit of punk","Clearly Chilton was trying to get as far away from the Big Star and Box Tops sounds as possible. With Like Flies he plunged into the netherworld of raw r&b, rock and punk. While his effort is admirable (particularly after such a long silence), Like Flies sounds like an album of rehearsals and outtakes.The originals are fairly weak and the covers, while eccentric and interesting, add nothing new to the original intrepetations. It's not surprising that Chilton chose to do a 180 turn after the commerical failure of Big Star and his rejection by the major record companies. What is surprising is that this dark, murky sounding record has so little of the creative spark that defines his best work. Chilton may consider this his masterpiece but history has shown that you should never trust the artist to judge their own material."
2,Okay but problems,"The phone was a great purchase for the price. The one big glitch is that the phone is so small and the ""off"" button is the wrong place. When I move by head to my shoulder to hold the phone, I disconnect the person I am on with!M. Shoemaker is right on in saying there is a glitch with the ""1"" not being available on caller ID. Luckily, I don't make many long distant calls from this phone!"
1,Broken within 12 months,"After twelve months of normal household use, two of the three handsets no longer work. Specifically, the 'dial'/'answer' button is almost impossible to depress. So I'm left with one functional phone and the answering machine. I don't think that $70 for one year's use is good value."
3,Good instruction and demos for the most part,"The title of the DVD is misleading. It is not a total body workout as it excludes calves, feet, most of the arm. A more correct title would be Total Torso Body Workout. Before rushing out and ordering the expensive Yamuna Balls and ball pump, try the body backball [...] or the j/fit 7"" ball. They are a fraction of the price and available on Amazon.com. If this kind of work is not for you you will not have wasted $$$$$. I do like that Yamuna demonstrated the movements on a model before having her students do it for the camera. I like the concept of body rolling and it seems it could be very beneficial. I am disappointed that (in my opinion)the Yamuna DVD's and balls are overpriced."
4,This stuff just works,"For the hard to get to clogs, like shower and tub bottoms, this is the best way of removing the clogs. I would give it five starts except that the title is misleading. This is just a refill kit for the Power plumber, meaning you are really only getting an aerosol can for this price."
5,Impressed,"Despite the rave reviews I didn't have very high hopes for this, but I was soooo wrong. Quick, easy, effective....AWESOME!"
4,power plumber,this item seems pretty nice. I think for regular clogs it would work great. Don't know what's wrong with my sink.
3,"Sink still slow draining, need a kit","My house is almost 50 years old with original cast iron plumbing. Bought this to help unclog the tub after hearing rave reviews on this site. Tried it in the sink first and it did work but water still slow moving, but twice the rate. Was hoping to unclog the tub but unfortunately the cap is not the right size, smaller than the drain opening. It might have worked better if I got the kit. Perhaps this house drains need enzyme as well since there might be more than hair down there."
5,FINALLY something that really works!,"I'd buy this product again in a heartbeat. After spending numerous $$$ on drain cleaners that did little or nothing, this product solved my chronic slow bathtub drain problem in a flash. Try it; you won't be disappointed. I plan to use one blast periodically to maintain the free flow, and I am quite confident I will never have to put up with a drain problem again. Just do it!"
3,Easy Reading/Philosophical Discussions,"Edited by Robert Lawrence who owns all rights to the book (translation belongs to editor) according to the book's jacket...The allegory(with refers continually about philosophical thought & ideology) ends on Pg 147 with the death of the king* and Zabiba*,with the 3rd country beside Iraq*(Saddam & its people) and the USA being Russia and proceeds on other philosophical ""essay""...Editors Notes are many(Pgs IX,X) as well as Pgs 1,2,5,10,16,20,30,31,66,87,122,123,124,127,132,133,134,143,148,154,155,174."
3,"not memorable, not bad","LONG descriptions, and lots of them. If you don't mind that style you are fine, if you do this will be a long slog. I may take a look at another book by these guys, but only if its in paperback and I can't find anything else. I think the over descriptiveness gets in the way of the actual plot."
5,"Briacoil, Mark","I've waited a long time for this book to come to fruition, and the wait was not in vain...I enjoyed every word! The research, the imagination, the characterization and the quality of writing are rivetting and well worth the investment of time expended in reading ""The Stoneholding"". And as with any good trilogy, one is left at the end of this one heaving a sigh of relief, and yet feeling anxious for what is yet to come. Briacoil, Mark!"
4,An enchanting world,"When you read the Stoneholding, you discover the world of Arvon. The richly detailed history of its people and culture create a storyboard or a background for the compelling narrative to unfold. The characters draw us into their world and their adventure keeps us captivated. The end is but a well-earned breathing space for our friends before their next head-long rush into danger. Bring it on!"
4,A great start,"My only complaint, and it's a big one for me, is that I thought the authors should have switched the storytelling viewpoint back to the Ferabek/Enbarr faction i.e. the bad guy's point of view, rather than always reading about Kal/Wilum/the Lammermorn Clansfolk. This, to my mind, was the single, biggest flaw of this First Book of the Talamadh. Other than that, ""The Stoneholding"" is a strong beginning for Mark & James. The authors have really laid out a world rich in history, culture, and legend, and I believe have really set the reader up for serious story development in those areas later on in this series. I look forward to reading the Second Book of the Talamadh."
1,pass this one up,"I think mostly everyone's already said it - pass this one up. If you're a lover of high fantasy, ""The Stoneholding"" is just going to make you cry (and not in a good way). Wordy, characters that are dull and not engaging, and a plot that's bogged down by bad writing. If you want to read this one... just don't. Get it from the library if you must waste your time on it."
5,Should Be a Bestseller Cookbook! Homecooked Delicious Meals,"This cookbook is great!! The recipes involve the basic ingredients found at most any grocery store and most involve about 6-10 ingredients. A womens hospital auxillary developed this book as a fundraiser. These are fairly easy recipes, but they all sound delicious... example: Coffee Toffee Ice Cream Pie, Pork Polynesian, Pork Chops and Apples, Broccoli Casserole I, II, and III, Egg Yolk Butter Cake, Lobster Newburg, Scallops in Cream and Mustard Sauce, Nutted Rice Torta, Marinated Vegetables... its one good one after another and the nice part is that they are almost all pretty simple to make. Its a keeper."
4,"Good product, a little pricey","The foot file does a really good job but it's definitely over-priced. I am a nut about keeping my feet nice and wasted lots of money on files that did not get the job done. However, I have found files on the market for $5-$10 that do just as well as this one. The problem with those is that they do not last for more than a few months. So, I won't feel too bad about buying this one as long as it lasts the rest of my life. We shall see..."
3,diamancel customer review,I thought the product was not as impressive as all the reviews and would rate it as just okay in terms of effectiveness. Mostly I was greatly dissapointed when a request from the Royal Mail arrived in place of my package for a fee of 12. 50. I had already paid a $17.00 shipping fee . When I complained to Diamencel they said said it was not their responsibility!! I was not impressed and would definately not recommend this product to anyone I know.
1,A feeble attempt to rewrite history.,"The millions of working class Americans who immediately felt the relief of FDR's new deal policies don't need a ""conservative perspective"" on the subject. This is a dry and compromised narrative that was written only to supply a contrary viewpoint with little regard to actual fact."
4,"Close to Season 1, better than Season 2","Though Season 1 of WKUK is prolly they funniest yet. Season 3 is a near 2nd, season 2 was a huge let down but the guys came back with this pretty funny compilation of ridiculous shorts."
4,Excellent book,"I am 17, and bought this book to learn more about growing into a beautiful (spiritually speaking) healthy woman, inside and out. I've learned a great deal from this brilliant book, and would recommend it to anyone, male or female, who wants to learn more about themselves or the women around them. It's a wonderful learning expierience."
4,A review of Melting Snow,"For anyone who's ever had a fascination with Russia and all things Russian as I have, this is an all-too-rare look inside Russian life, and the character of the Russian people, and it made me even more resolved to go there as soon as I can. Interesting facts and anecdotes about life in Siberia stood out for me when reading this book, and how people overcome obstacles and hardships, and still managed to be witty, fun people . Conor Clery writes very well, and is a very observant and compassionate writer."
5,Great guide book,"I spent two weeks in the Canadian Rockies hiking and used this book as one of my guides. I did several of the ""Premier"" and ""Outstanding"" hikes found in this book.I am a day hiker and do not backpack. I liked the organization of the book by levels of Worthiness due to the panoramic payoff at the end of the hike as related to the effort to get there. I agree with the authors and do not want to spend hours in the woods only to get a glimpse at the very end of a majestic viw. I found the descriptions of hikes accurate. I highly recommend this book. One note is the book fell apart from the binding soon after I purchased it but Amazon replaced it."
2,Don't Waste Your Time... With This Book,"I suppose if you want a relatively inexpensive ""North Cascades"" trail guide it's OK, but listen to their advice and you'll end up missing some great hikes."
3,"Good information, but TOO opinionated","This is a good guidebook for what they choose to cover. I have hiked the North Cascades for more than 25 years, and know the region well. While the authors are entitled to their opinions, and are up front about their prejudices, they dismiss offhand many wonderful destinations. I realize that they are attempting to only ""hit the high points,"" but can't always agree with their appraisals. That being said, it is still a good resource for hikers interested in exploring the exquisite and sublime scenery of the North Cascades."
2,Less Than Impressed,"The idea of this book is amazing. The editing of this book is not. I found so many mistakes that it was often hard to read. One sentence had 6 commas and was five lines long. Poor writing and poor editing, I'm sure there is a better book out there."
5,wonderful read - great book for content and book design,"""Your Time Has Come"" is a really special work. On my first read, I jumped around the pages. On my second read, I read it from front to back. It was on my second read I realized that my time had come to really feel the narrative. The book weaves vignettes that project movement, emotion and time. There is a lot of humor and more irony than a blue hotel.The other distinguishing feature of the book is the design -- it is sparse with clean, modern typeography, There are no page numbers. The minimalism properly reflects the tone.Highly Recommended."
1,What is going on?,"Up until this album I have like every Sugar Ray album. Even though they went from bad asses to more contemporary rock, the self-titled and 14:59 were still good. In fact I think they showed the most talent on 14:59 and the Self-Titled was a good feel good album. Now to this album, ""the new one"". You know your careers over when you've been a rock band forever and then include a rap/rock song on your album. What the hell was going on? Did Sugar Ray really even write that Bartender song? Were they offered a barrel of cash to write crappy songs? I don't know, I just hope the next CD has some meaning to it. Go back to any other style you want to or don't, just stop getting pussified...please!!! Anyone who reads this, DON'T buy this CD."
3,"Nice cover this Sugar Ray CD,, buttt....","first of all...,if you lay yourhands {just agrab:;{on this i.p.o.l CD} kind of a light chunky..man,}..just want to say this wek!!! is just don't put that ""OK"" enough effort to it,,{.the content}Lazy... But some songs is nice to listen to:>> especially.'Is She Really Going Out With Him""'and the one featuring that funny-to dead,creative..[what!}SHAGGY.whateever it is, the CD title..,""In the persuit of Leisure"";so it DOES like..leisurrrre ya know!perhaps they just too ""Leisureee and it is damn ""lazzieee.Here'..buy if you have 50 bucks spare and YOU want to HEAR it for yourself ...just buy this impulsely lahh:; for MARk mc grath ...like""that..,,Ya right"
5,~~~~~~~~SPEECHLESS~~~~~~~~~~~,"what should i tell u?!i'm SPEECHLESS because i just listened to this great sugar ray album!!!it's just grandiosely and awesome!!! i'm really NOT kidding!simply listen to it and u HAVE TO believe me!because if u hear it u must love it!! and if u have it u want another one!!so if u don't have all sugar ray albums... buy them, too and u will never forget to smile!!because their good mood vibe is unpayable!!!the WHOLE world should hear about that great sound!! because it lets u forget allyour sorrows and even if u don't want to it lets your body dance!!however, ""IN THE PURSUIT OF LEISURE"" is worth every cent!!ENJOY it!! i'm glad to have it.... hehe ;)"
1,"Very, Very Dissapointed","""In the Pursuit of Leisure"" might be better titled ""In the Pursuit of another Paycheck."" Fans of the Lemonade and Brownies CD, the classic self titled CD, or any of their hard rock should save their money and not even give this a chance. I tried, I really did, to like this CD but you know what? the songs are repetetive with no real idea to hold interest. Maybe they're after an older, not so likely to headbang crowd this time around... but for those of us who still like RPM and other heavy music... this album is just too leisurly."
4,Best Yet,"Sugar Ray's CD ""In The Pursuit Of Leisure"" I think is probably the best CD they have made yet. Although they have many great hits from their other CD's, ""Mr. Bartender"" is the best, because it has a different and exciting beat. On their other CD's the beat and rhythm is fast and energized, whereas on this CD the music is calm and not as jumpy. It's all great music because it was contemplated by a great band, but this CD seemed as if they were actually ""in the pursuit of leisure"", and found it with relaxing music. And adding Shaggy was great it added the right touch to ""56 Hope Road"". This CD made a huge impact all over America and, I think I speak for a lot of people, we greatly anticipate the release of their next CD."
1,Pathetic,This album is just sad.Sugar ray have always been a guilty pleasure of mine and i'v had no problem admitting I liked them...until now.This album is a big joke piriod.It lacks the maturity of the self titeld and the catchy pop rock of 14:59.Sugar ray tryed to sell out and make bubbelgum pop with this release and faid misurably.
2,The Last Straw for Sugar Ray?,I have been a long time loyal fan of Sugar ray for over 8 years. I stood strong during 14:59 and the self titled. I stood beside them and told myself everyone has got to grow up and accepted their major change from Floored and Lemonade and Brownies. This album has weak lyrics and is a pathetic attempt at an album. I know this band has a few more good songs in them and I just hope they stick it out and make another album.... b/c this sucks!!
3,Too much slow music,"I have always loved sugar ray, right from their first cd ""Lemonade and Brownies"". Just about every song they have made is good. On all of their cd's they have only had a few but good slow songs....On this cd there are way too many slow songs. I like mr. Bartender, the only fast song on the cd...Dont miunderstand me, I think that all of the songs on the cd are good, but they are too slow and too much alike... Hope that their next cd will have the style that songs like ""Fly"", ""every morning"", ""Words to me"", ""disasterpiece"" and ""personal spaceinvaders"" have and maybe some of their old rock too.... I really loved ""Sweet home California"""
5,Mr. Bartender by Sugar Ray,"I rate this album 5 stars from just what I have heard of the latest song released because I live in a very rural area, no Wal-Marts, sorry. I have heard Mr. Bartender off of the In The Pursuit Of Leisure CD only 2 times from the radio and 1 time from the MTV station. I hope this rating doesn't detour anyone from listening to the CD. I would really encourage anyone to listen to the CD. If there was a record store close by I would be there to purchase this Sugar Ray CD. Mr. Bartender, I believe will go to decent numbers on the charts."
5,Heaven!!!!,"This CD will Take you to ""Heaven"". I love the new CD it's a grat CD for everone that want to have fun this summer. Produced by David Kahne and mixed by Michael H.Brauel that done a great job on this CD ""Word"". Sugar Ray Another 15 years of summer music!!!!Mark,Rodney,Stan,Murpgy and Craig ""ROCK ON"""
4,Sugar Ray's 4th album!,"Following their self-titled album, the boys at Sugar Ray have yet again blessed us with some great music. The style in In Purusit of Leisure is similar to their self-titles album, which differs greatly from their first releases (Lemonade and Brownies, which was punk rock at its best; and Floored, which was slightly more softcore with the addition of ""Fly""). 14:59, symbolizing that their 15 minutes of fame were almost up, was an absolute smash, and was more of an alternative style of music more than it was punk or pop. In Pursuit of Leisure is pure gold, with maybe the slight exception of the ""pause 'n play"" style they incorporated into ""Chasin' you around"", ""photograph of you"", ""can't start"" and ""in through the doggie door"". It worked for ""photograph"" due to the somberness and loneliness of the song, but it was a bit of overkill for the other three!But all in all, check out Mr Bartender, Spinning Away, Snug Harbour and Heaven! Keep up the work, boys, and give us another album!"
3,"Unlike Clemente, not a Hall of Fame work,","I loved Bruce Markusen's Baseball's Last Dynasty on the Moustache Gang era Oakland A's. This one despite my love of the '70s Pittsburgh Pirates was kind of dull, to be honest.It read too much like a rote reworking of the game stories from that 1971 World Series season. I wanted more on the personalities of the players from Roberto Clemente to Willie Stargell to Steve Blass.Why did the author choose this approach? It's like he scooped all this stuff off newspaper microfiche and slapped in together in chronological order.I still read it from cover to cover but it's not a keeper and that's sad.Then again the Pirates yesterday clinching their 18th straight losing season (a North American pro sports record) here in 2010 is sadder."
4,Integration in Major League Baseball,"I lived in Pittsburgh in 1971 in an integrated neighborhood, watched the Pirates play but did not realize what was happening with the 1971 Pirates. This book taught me about Roberto Clemente's struggle throughout his career, particularly in spring training in the south. It also taught me about the Pirates' management and how they ignored the color line and created history in 1971."
4,Nice product,"The tester works well. Nice that it tests both ways, red or green light. I use it on 24 volt systems and it has no problem, many of the 12 volt testers burn out the bulb."
3,An odd title,"If nothing else, this book is a great example of a readily available piece of material where John McCain himself describes himself as a ""maverick"". As of late, he's been saying he's never used that phrase for himself."
2,Merely adequate,"The player is cheaply constructed.More importantly, DVD-R discs of various type play, but there are firmware problems prohibiting accurate chapter forward and backward movement using the skip button. I found several DVD-R discs that play on other players that will not play on this unit.The remote control is large and has a strange and non-intuitive key layout.Some of the LCD displays must be in Chinese, since they make no sense in English!The front panel so-called 'jog' is a joke...again unintuitive layout and incomplete buttons for control.There are better inexpensive players out there!"
3,Not multiregional!,"As far as I can tell this DVD does not read DVD's from europe. I have them, and I get a message stating 'wrong region'. You can take this to Europe and watch North American DVD's with the PAL output. If anyone has read european DVD's with this product please let me know.Otherwise, for the price it's a fine unit."
3,Great deal for the price,"Well, I've only watched a few DVDs on the 302V, but I have to say I am pretty happy. The player does all that was advertised and more! As to playing different region DVDs, it actually has a remote button to switch among NTSC, PAL, and multi-region. No hacks needed! I WILL say that I am slightly disappointed in some artifacts on the screen, primarily bleeding of color into white letters when the credits roll. But this may be more my composite video connections. I'll likely get a Monster Cable S-video hookup. Also, I have to confirm others' comments on the remote. It does a lot, and the buttons are well-spaced, but it is confusing as hell to use and there appears little logic to how it is laid out. It also would be nice to have Power On/Off on the remote."
2,Directions are impossible,"I bought this bike based on recommendations from several friends. After working on it for over 2 hours yesterday, we finally got it together but it's not really together.The directions are simply the worst directions I've ever seen. I would have read the directions cover to cover first (I always do that) but there are no written directions. There are pictures--and they don't always make sense. For example, it will have a drawing of a screw and it will say ""actual size"" but there is no screw that looks exactly like the drawing.I'm giving this 2 stars because after I have someone else fix it, it looks like it will hold up. My son likes the seat and the parental steering is pretty easy to use--we just need the handle bars to stay on.I'm dreading the idea of returning this item, but if we can't get the handle bars to stay on it's going back to Amazon."
1,A messy toy,"It looks good, but a nightmare to put together, and once put togetther, 's just a mess. The handle bars pop off, the steering is off and just very difficult for my 3 year old. He wanted to ride it but I didn't feel it safe and just sent it back."
4,Great bike with some minor issues,"I'll start off my saying I really like this bike and my 12 month old can't get enough of it! It's durable and I love the colors. Having the stationary pedals is great. Also, the ability to either lock the front steering and/or the real wheel's turing ability is a nice bonus. Assembly is a bit of a pain. Also, for the price I really wished it came with the seatbelt. If you are planning on installing the seatbelt make sure you do it DURING regular assembly as it is a hassle to get the seat off so you can get the seatbelt on. The steering doesn't work as well as some of the others that I have tried, but it's still easy enough."
2,Free spin pedals are an issue for learning and fun,"I bought this tricycle based on the great reviews and pushbar capability. I had read one review about the free spin pedals being an issue but didn't realize how big the problem it would be before I bought it. My 2 year old son could not easily learn that pedaling forward would make the trike move and would just wait to be pushed. When I stopped pushing and encouraging him to paddle, it just stopped being fun for him. On hindsight, I would never purchase a tricycle with free spin pedals."
5,Almost 9 years already?,I bought this in a dollar bin one day and was amazed. Awesome album and I wish this group did more. I know nothing about them outside this cd.
5,Inspirational and Practical,"This book took my breath away with its honest portrayal of the everyday lives of children. The reader takes a privileged ringside seat in a special classroom where author/master teacher Mona Halaby makes it possible for children to understand and respect themselves and eachother. In the current frenzy about raising test scores in our schools, it's easy to forget that real learning occurs only when students feel safe and accepted. The nuts and bolts chapter on running class meetings Halaby-style is a bonus for teachers, but this book is for anyone (parents, coaches, camp counselors, therapists . . . ) who want to learn how to talk with young people about issues of belonging/exclusion, taking responsibility for learning and behavior, and being a good friend."
1,unreliable seller,"seller posts items that they do not have to sell or have posted to sell for more in other sites. I ordered two books from this seller that they did not have to ship me. don't waste your time dealing with them, buy elsewhere and save the time and hastle of having to find another product to buy when they cancel the order."
1,"Reading this is a waste of time, buying it, a waste of money","This book is a waste of time unless you only read the Appendix--""Postscript for Teachers: The Nuts and Bolts"" This section is about 15 pages and frankly isn't worth the time either! The rest of the book contains many stories that are too long, boring and simply not needed. Was the author paid by the word? Plus, the reading level of this book -- Ugh! -- did she write it for educators, or for 3rd graders?Spend the money on something else! Or check it out at a library!"
5,Just read this book and see if it doesn't change your life!!,"Rick Warrens book has inspired chritians like me to once again get my focus back to where it belongs. As a christian you can easily slip back to your selfish world and find yourself deprressed and unhappy, the way you were before you became a christian. The book will open your heart and mind and get you to think about the BIGGER picture. Its all about Jesus in the end. The sooner we all realize that truth the easier we will start living a more meanignful life -- A life filled with purpose."
1,Warren has a Narrow View,"I found this book to be offensive and narrow-minded. There was a generous sprinkling of bible verses throughout, unfortunately many of them were used out of context and without regard to historical and cultural significance.It's pretty typical of the kind of garbage you'd expect from fundamentalists who have cornered the market on the word ""Christian""."
1,"So bad, I want to warn other parents!","We got this at the library, and if you are looking for insipid lyrics, trite music, and poor animation, this is the DVD for you. It's marked for ages three and up, but unless your preschooler doesn't yet know that a cow goes ""moo"" and an owl lives in a tree, I don't think they will learn anything new! It's truly one of the worst children's DVDs I've ever seen."
5,electronic-downtempo music at it's best,"WHAT AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM!!!it's just amazing hearing these singles compilation from AIR, one of my best bands in this genre, the music is so groovy and chill...is excellent to getting relax at work or home or even for a background music for a social gather with friends or even for getting intimate with your couple!!Very nice ambient music, it's really a jewel, an electronic masterpiece, must get your copy if you're in this kind of electronic music (kinda trip-hop)...these french dudes from AIR really rules!"
5,Excellent Lounge music,"I don't know what to say about this cd that hasn't already been said. But I do know that I agree with every person who said this cd was defenitely worth getting. I think it is better than ""Moon Safari""-Their other cd- and is frankly, in my opinion better than a lot of electronica artists out there. it's simply so unique, it's jazzy and funky, yet tranquil, trancey and loungey. Well anyways, I strongly recomend this cd!"
4,"good, but...","This is a patchy rerelease. The two bonus tracks are average (originally b-sides of other releases) and not in keeping with the spirit of the original release. And why isn't Amazon offering the enhanced version, complete with video? I discovered I can easily purchase both pressings at my local."
1,"Scratched, skips on the best song.","I bought this cd for a specific song, the 5th track. The cd had a scratch when I opened it and the first time I played it in my car, it skipped through the entire track 5. Every other song plays fine, but this one is the best of them all, and I was(and am) pretty pissed."
4,great study music,"this cd is one of my favorites to study to. its has complex rythms, beautiful melodic lines, funky sounds, yet it is easy to listen to and is not distracting."
3,Not As Complete As the First But Best We Can Do For Now,"A nice complement to the first album ""Moon Safari"" which was easily the best of 1998 and one the decades best too. Although it was released later ""premiere"" is earlier AIR tracks and as such are not as developed as Moon's nor is the album as complete. But then again Moon is just about impossible to live up to. This will do before Moon II comes out."
5,Laid Back Groove,"A little different from Moon Safari, but equally listenable. Definitely nocturnal groove music, shades of the seventies French space rock scene and still very romantic with horns and strings. I keep waiting for Petula Clark to break in----oh dear I.m dating myself, (yaya twist). Can't wait for their next entry!"
5,Incredible,"If you like Air, this is a must. One of the best singles I had ever bought. The sounds are eclectic and interesting. This is a great example of just how talented Air is. A definite must have!"
5,A magical journey into an undiscovered land of electronica.,"This cd may prove to be the definitive in 90s contemporary ""mood music"". Mesmerising analogue synthesisers, perfect chord progressions and innovative combinations of acoustic and electronic instruments characterise this dreamy and evocative masterpiece. Best moment: the bridge in 'Brakes On' featuring lucid fingerpicked guitar and floating synthesiser. Best track: Le Soleil Est Pres De Mois."
4,Porn Soundtrack,"Call me a freak, but i love this album and it reminds me of the soundtrack for any generic 70s porn flick. That, by the way, makes it good mood music."
3,"War, war, WAR!","This game is a war game. Not a civilization game but a good old fashion, build the armies, insult the neighbors and invade the enemy cities, war game. And it is fun to play. You can pick your troops, select your tactics and build up you supplies. Some trade and politics polish it off but in the end, you build up your numbers, try to balance your units out. You know, get some spear men, some bow men, some cavalry, go for that combined arms thing, and don't let the enemy sneak into your nation without a fight.In the end the only problem is that fighting the computer is too easy and boring. You need human enemies. So you need other people who own this game. Ooops, outside of me, it seems that everybody else who has ever written a review on this game on the web hates it. So that's not going to happen unless you buy two copies and give one to your friend."
4,Excellent Resource,After reading and using this great book I gained the confidence I needed to write more professional business documents and e-mails. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to communicate clearly within the workplace and with clients. Great easy-to-use tips and guidelines made it easy.
5,"Fantastic depiction of early 1900's in North Park, Colo.","Excellent writing of life of the cattle rancher in early 1900's. Much knowledge and research went into these writings. Very accurate as to the life of the rancher during these times (and certainly applicable to today in many areas!). For those who enjoy romance (young Kelsey leaves Scotland and his girl to begin new life in America), intrigue (just where is this land of plenty and cattle that just grow themselves?), history (Scotland, North Park and the ""roots"" of a special ""breed"" of people) and a dose of ""bar-room type brawl"", you will find this a most enjoyable book"
4,golf ball case,My husband bought me this case for a present and it displays all my favorite golf balls perfectly. The brown paper took awhile to get off but don't use anything sharp as it is acrylic and will scratch. Loved it!
2,Golf Ball Case,"This product was a huge disappointment to me. I literally had to throw it away as I would not display it in my home. The outside and wood were fine. However, during the packaging and shipping, the company put a large brown paper product on all the acrylic. When I opened the box from shipping, I had to use a razor blade and Goo Gone to even attempt to get rid of the brown paper. In doing so, the acrylic scratched so much that the case was unusable. It was not worth, at all , the money and shipping I paid for it. Unless the seller can get the brown stuff off first, don't even bother to order. You will be unhappy. Anyone who plays golf at a country club knows you do not put sub-standard item in your home, ESPECIALLY to show off your prize golf balls!"
4,Thai~nee Bubbles,"As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand during the mid-80's, never heard Dr. & Mrs. Holmes mentioned as former PC trainers nor the approaches per se. After living in Thailand almost 3 years & marrried to a Thai for 25+, I can truly appreciate this work. The technology 'computer class' refs are definitely outdated. The thought bubbles are pithy & poignant. So after some time, the central themes are tragic and truthful, as evident by the recent transecting of Thai society, ie yw v. red.. still trying to sort the caste-like system corroding like an old battery. Voting rights, English media, tech devices & Thai migrant laborers abroad are transforming this generation. Future decisions are carbonizing an effervescent culture. The definition of being 'a Thai' may be changing. I truly hope the good things remain which can be appreciated by all who value the uniqueness of such a culture."
1,This gun is outta bullets,"The gun in Knotts' hand wasn't the only thing shaking after watching this junk. My whole body was, from anger! I put my 97 year old mommy through this and at the end of it she could not stop throwing up! My 109 year old grandmother cried that after this she had nothing to live for! Thanks, Barney, for breaking up my family! END"
3,Better than taking a sleeping pill.,"If you liked Don Knotts inThe Incredible Mr. Limpet (Keepcase)(1964),The Ghost and Mr. Chicken(1966),The Reluctant Astronaut(1967), you might like him in this silly western-comedy. A Philadelphia man graduates from dentistry and tries to head out to California. He ends up in the wild west, in Big Spring.The idea in this town is how are the Indians getting the guns. Barbara Rhodes (NBC past serial, Generations) is just a scamp who tries to make the goodies on Don Knotts. He's on his way west and she intends to go along with him to get there as well. Even if it means forcing the man to marry her.Not the best of Don Knotts films, but might be better than taking a sleeping pill.Also in the cast: Ruth McDevitt, Pat Morita and William Christopher."
4,Good and Safe!,"Now I'm not going to say this is a great movie! But it is exactly what I think one would expect. He gets in over his head and comes out smelling like a rose. In between the two, it's funny and entertaining. Will never compete with many of today's comedies, but you don't have to worry if your children walk in the room. To me that's a plus!"
3,forbidden beach,"I found the movie a little over the top. Boys tend to care for their mother than their father. The oldest son here is so upset that his mother has found a new boy friend that murder is more than on his mind. He chooses to light him afire in his sleep. In the end the boy wins outs, sheltered and unpunished. The only thing good to be seen is the boys good looks and his butt, if you like such a view."
3,A little hard to believe.,I found the story line a bit hard to believe. The engineer's (pursuer of the boy's mother) tolerance of the boy's hostile actions was inexplicable. Any intelligent man would have removed himself from the situation.
1,not worth it,"I figured there must be something good about this film if it was so hard to get and so high a cost. But it was really bad. low quality, lame premise. Kids were the highlight of the film, cute and funny."
3,Not really good,"Ok, i admit, im one of those ones that didnt have an mp3 player till like 4 days ago, i know im weird. Well i thought i should start off by buying a good small beginner mp3 player just so i dont have to spend alot of money. Well i picked this, i was happy at first, then it went downhill.....Pros:+ Good size, i love the size better than the ipod+ Has a backlit screen+ Has a radio+ Comes with all the stuff u need+ Good MenusCons:- Freezes ALOT!!!- Get alot of errors- Sometimes the comp. wont read that its plugged in- Not alot of songs can go on it- It is VERY slow- Battery charges take along timeIN THE END: It isnt a very good mp3 player even for a beginner, just disaster after disaster after disaster, i bought this off of ebay for $130 new, and now im goin to sell it off of ebay for a good price and get an ipod, u see what i mean? you'll know if you buy this"
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought my philips HDD070 about a year ago and now the thing is dead. When it did work, file transfers were incredibly slow. Also, the software that accompanied this ridiculous excuse of an MP3 player was awful. Every time I put an audio cd into my computer, the program would launch itself, often taking 2 minutes to simply open. I have a brand new lap top, so I doubt it was my computer. I have lost my faith in Philips - Never again will I have anything to do with them as far as MP3 players go."
3,It's was a good purchase a couple years ago but there's A LOT better today!,"I purchased it back 04/09/05 and today January 15th 2008 , it's crapped up on me but could have a lot sooner since I haven't really used it the past year or so. The software is very difficult to work with. I only rate it a three star because it did last a while, just wish it was still under warranty! After reviewing their troubleshooting section on their website for this product, my memory is somehow corrupted which requires me to contact them to get it repaired...it would probably lead to costing me more then buying a new one. :( arggggg."
2,Not for the price tag...,"I purchased this device two days ago from a local retailer, and let's just say I'm headed to take it back today.The pros are that it's a neat little device in terms of size, weight, and ease of using the buttons.The problem is that (keep in mind I'm not the most tech-savvy person) I could only get it to hold 25 songs equaling 106MB of space. So much for the advertised 2.0 GB. I called Philips customer service, and asked what I was doing wrong. I was told that 25 is an average number. The representative said that I could compress the files so that I could fit more songs onto the player, however he said that typically the device will begin to freeze or malfunction in other ways once you get to 50 songs or so. He also informed me that 50% of his calls are people like me asking the same question.I also found the bass boost to be disappointing. Overall, it's not a bad player, but not worth the price paid."
4,Works great with Music Match!,"If you purchase this device, don't install the software that comes with the device. Just use Music Match 9.0. All you need to do is download the free plug-in for this device. The best way to send tracks to your portable device is to just send all of your tracks to a playlist and click ""send to"" portable device. That's all there is to it."
3,The product was ok,"I did recieve the product in a timely manner but, im not sure that it is actually 2GB like it was promised to be. but other then that the quality of the product is good. I would buy from him again."
1,Waste of my time and money,"I bought this item thinking that being a computer savy person, I wouldn't struggle with some of the issues some people said they had. WRONG. Sometimes it doesn't turn off. Sometimes it doesn't know it's connected to computer. I've been able to load only one song onto it - and it's one I already had. How many times do I want to hear one song. I used the musicmatch software that was ""highly recommended."" Then the helpline person at PHilips told me he wouldn't advise using it! None of the music would load onto my player, never has and apparently never will. Wasted $10 to find out the software that came with it doesn't actually work with it, and so far I can't find download music software that will work with it. I try to email company - no response until I got nasty. They email me to call helpline again - not good - I only use a prepaid cell phone. Getting more expensive. Planning to buy iPod. Save your money and frustration, buy anything else."
3,Definitely has its flaws,"I purchased this MP3 Player and was excited when I received it. My excitement almost immediately turned to frustration when it recognized only about 33% of my MP3s (I have about 12 GB). The software that comes with the player will only reasonably recognize your MP3s if they have ID tags (ie Title, Artist, Genre, Track). I found (based on another review) the dbPoweramp to be very useful to place the appropriate tags on all the albums in my library. This takes a tremendous amount of time to appropriately title songs to get recognized, however, once you get past that the player is great. The only drawback, definitely, is the software. Its a cool little player otherwise. I hope this helps."
2,Problems!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this product on Feb. 28 first they gave me a corrupt disc that wouldnt load on my computer, so i had to download the online version of the installation cd which took about 4 drooling hours. IT doesnt have good battery life at all in the morning its full at night its low. And the bad news is i set it down and tried to turn it on and it would not power on. SO now i think this is broken. And i will never spend 170.00 on this piece of crap again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Suggestions:Get an Ipodor something else its worth your money"
2,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed in this book. It was too short for one thing. It just wasn't what I expected it to be.
1,Terrible.,The only disc this game came with was the second one of Burning Crusade. CD keys were not included nor were install discs. This is completely worthless.
5,Great Game,The Game is Awesome. it's really cool. If you're on the border get it. Have a great day guys.
1,Swindled,I love the game and all but Durabest played me...played me bad! I bought the game used just because it would be cheaper knowing that the disks were going to be used and the books. Durabest never explained that the game key was used and now I can't upgrade my game at all. It's the Battle Chest edition and I can only play on the trial mode...Thanks Durabest.
2,This game would have been great...,Well I played Wow for a while on a friends account before I decided to buy it. And once I did I figured to get the Battlechest... I bought it through amazon and SURPRISE none of my keys work. Blizzard is giving me the run around and it's really getting annoying.Be careful. If your gonna buy this I suggest you use a retailer who doesn't allow returns on this product. So no one can steal your key like mine.
1,didnt ship all items!!!,my concern is that i didnt get all the items! i am missing the disk #1 and its manditory that i get it! because now im stuck with something i cant use!!!! and i bought the world of warcraft battle chest but i need the first disc to use it.
4,Was worried but now I'm good.,The picture of the battle chest is misleading because for a moment I thought I hadn't gotten wrath of the lich king but once you register it with blizzard it is all good.
1,Does not work,Game arrived to destination fine but the game code does not work. Found out that it is a European code and will not work for US clients.
4,Suprisingly addictive,"I got this after doing a free 10 day trial from Blizzard. After about 3-4 days of the trial I was pretty hooked and decided it was worth the money to get the full version of the game. (Very limited differences in the trial version so it's definitely worth testing out before you buy the full version.)I'm not usually into long play games like this, but after seeing a bunch of different things about the game (including a very funny South Park episode) I decided to check into it a bit further.I will say the game is much more fun if you can play with people you know, but you don't have to. I've found almost every person I've met in the game to be very helpful and understanding to new players so it makes it easy to get into the game and get what you want out of it.I'd encourage people to definitely do the trial software and see how you like it, but I'm confident most people that play video games will find some portion of this entertaining."
5,Awesome gift set!,This is the best deal if you want to get someone started on WoW as a gift for any occasion! I love the idea that it has 2 of the strategy guides and both sets of the game. I just wished they threw in an extra dungeon guide or pre-paid game card. :P
4,great starter set for new wow fans.,this is a great package for the new wow player.not only do you get the first 2 installments of the wow game but the 2 game guides are great for referancing even while playing the game.yes almost all this is avaialble online but there is something great about having the info in written form at your fingertips.2 discs 3 books and a 10 free trial (if you get the sealed product).not much for the more experienced wow player.well worth the cost if your starting out.
4,War Crack: Wrath of the ex-Wife,"The single most addictive and fun game ever conceived. I've been playing games since pong (yes, i'm what most the kids who play this would call ""old""), yelling to the ""voice activated"" atari consol, Nintendo, Playstation, XBox played em all. What i've always really loved were the Dungeons and Dragons games. Where DnD jumped the shark, WOW has excelled. Finally, in the last two expansions, you don't have to get divorced to have nice gear. I've had the games, but new computer, new continent, had to get the games because the internet in Iraq is, well suspect. Anyways, hours and hours ad infinum of fun. Buy this, you gotta get Lich King too. Excellent graphics, interesting quests and dungeons (called instances in WOW). And you like PvP, this is the game for you. Old or young, you won't be dissappointed."
3,Fun Fun Fun!,"Benn seriously addicted to this game for over 2 years. except for recent (and now solved ""additional instances cannot be launched"") problems, this game has been fun. I can't wait for expansion pack 3 to finally come out."
5,WoW,"I have had one friend beg me to play this game online for years. Then my brother started playing. I finally caved and tried out the trial. I'm hooked. Not only is this a fun game, but w/ voice chat I get to talk friends and family for free while we play together. I can honestly say it's helped me bond with my brother and we now have a better relationship because of it."
5,good expansion pack,i thought the expansion was pretty fun to play.kept me hooked the entire length of the expansion and the dungeons and raids were challenging.
4,World of Warcraft is great but tough to install.,"A fantastic game - easily played and graphically beautiful. Patience will be needed during the install as it does not actually install from the box as it is supposed to. Patches are available on the website and tech help is 12-48 hours of lagtime. That said, I am playing it and having fun, but on the free trial version as I have not yet figured out how to get the full install completed and this is a week after receipt of box."
4,WOW game review,"I have played Guild Wars for 2 1/2 years and am not trying World of Warcraft to see what the buzz is all about. To date it seems to be a more refined,robust and challanging game. WOW does require more interaction and game play with other persons, which open a whole new world of friendship and networking. Not to mention good waring buddies."
1,Waste of money!!,"I recently purchased this game so that I could play along with my boyfriend. First of all the box was slightly beat up, but I didn't pay much attention to that. I opened the box and tried to load the games. It was successful until I went to sign in. It turns out that these games are the European version, so not only can I not play with my boyfriend, but my computer saw the games as ""foreign"", freaked out, and now I am having some major problems. Nowhere on the box does it say that this is a ""European version"", so unless you read the itty bitty print on the back of the CD, or your computer freaks out like mine did, you would never know. I would recommend that no one buy these games from Amazon, either someone messed up, or they obviously don't know what they're doing. I am VERY unhappy and wish that I hadn't wasted my time, money, effort, and computer."
1,Friends don't let friends play World of Warcraft,"This game is really, really addictive. The sad thing is it's only moderatly fun because it get's very repetitive. You will find yourself wasting tons of time on this game, and when you're not playing and you're at school or work, you will be thinking about playing it as soon as you get home. Buyer beware this game is worse than nicotine and crack combined. . . friends don't let friends play WoW . . ."
1,this game is for retards,this games needs to destroyed its way to easy and takes no skill at all to beat it. ffxi is far more difficult then wow
1,Cookie cutter MMO. Stale & Boring,"If you're looking for a good single player game, or enjoy sitting aorund for hours talking to people you don't know on the internet, WoW might be right for you. Otherwise steer clear and save yourself a boatload of cash.Leveling up to 70 can be fun, there is enough to do to avoid grinding at least with your first character. Once you're there though, the game screeches to a bloody halt.PvP is lackluster, pointless, and wholly unenjoyable.Raids are enjoyable if you like sitting around for hours.Every character in late game is identical both in equipment and abilities for a given class.Blizzard also decided to completely ruin Warcraft's back story too.Play something else."
2,Parents Be Aware of Torture!,"At one point in Warcraft characters are asked to use a device on a prisoner until the prisoner releases a certain location. You are told it's OK for your character to torture as you are not bound by restrictions. The item you use to torture (as stated in game), ""inflicts incredible pain"". The human character you torture pleads for the player to stop. Just something to think about."
4,Great game,"I recommend this game for anyone who loves MMORPG's. I did get a bit mad when, a couple of weeks after purchasing the product, it went on sale for $10 (opposed to the $40 that I paid)."
5,Too much fun,"I was conned into playing this again by a friend of mine...I didn't think I would like it as much as I do!! Hours of fun, more fun playing with friends of course"
5,Best Deal,"Battlechest is the way to go if you've tried the trial and are interested in WoW.You save money and get decent info about The Buring Crusade content.Until Wrath of the Litch King comes out,this is what you should be buying.Now as an aside I don't approve of the way Blizzard handles many things,but they do have a stable game that doesn't do strange things like wipe out your OS(as another company has done,CCP.Don't buy into their junk.)Try the trial first to see if you like the game.If you do buy this and upgrade your account.Try different realms at first until you find one suitable to your gameplay.Then have fun,because frankly that is what this game is all about...fun."
3,wow!,"well, world of warcraft is its own addictive, dangerous, manipulative, sick and twisted. . . thing. that aside, this is a better deal than the blizzard website offers for the same product, and definitely cheaper than buying the two games separate. as for the guides that come with it, they're not very helpful to anyone who's been playing for awhile. they mostly just cover the basics."
1,Angry as hell,Wasted my money on this because the author sent a EU version instead of US. Why would you sell a EU version on US website?If you want US version don't waste your money on this.
5,I love WoW,"World of warcraft is an awesome game. Be aware that since it is an online game the world and features are at their most recent incarnation which is cataclysm, two expansions ahead of the battle chest. This makes the guides slightly obsolete in talking about the maps and missions within older sectors of the game. The basic and advanced game core info is still very useful though and the guides are fun and interesting to read. Also be aware that you can get the game client and upgrades through downloading and never deal with the actual game CD's although if you ever have problems and lose your client having the CD's to recover the game is a lot faster and easier than redownloading the client. If you are interested in getting started in WoW I would recommend the battle chest to get you started."
3,Oldies juke box music,"Fairly good album. Few 1 hit wonder type of songs, but still over all good cd."
2,Woulda Shoulda Coulda,"There's no question about it. This book is yet another example of Diane Disalvo Ryan's great writing and wonderful illustrations, but there's a spirit missing. Sadly, that special something that inspired her to write books like Uncle Willie and the Soup Kitchen and City Green is gone. It is evident to this writer that her heart and soul just isn't in it anymore.I used to be a fan of this writer/illustrator but, I feel let down and very disappointed by her recent offerings. I won't be reading anymore of Mrs. Ryan's books. The thrill is gone."
3,Need a supplier,The book gave a lot of great information for me as a first time chicken raiser but I am not a builder and have been unable to find someone to build the chicken tractor because the plan is so vague. I would love to know of a supplier that I could by a kit from with complete instructions for us who need more help
