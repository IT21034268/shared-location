2,How Many Lies?,"I really wanted to like this book. I searched & searched for it . . . (I am a cheapskate so I wanted to find a good price). After reading the first in the series I was so excited!These two lead characters have no chemistry together. Viviana & Quin did not even get together until the very end of the book (after being together as mistress/patron in the first few pages). Even the ""coming together"" was very bland. I forced myself to get to the end. I really did not like her at all. Two Lies? Just about everything Viviana did was a lie."
1,Can the Hero/Heroine say I- M- A- T- U- R- E ?,"And will they ever grow up? Apparently 10 years changed absolutely nothing between these two protagonists, so, I see no hope for any future between them. I'd rather watch the WWF and I abhor wrestling or at least that brand of it. I do appreciate the non-pro school versions of it. Liz, I am not sure what happened here but you are a better writer than this. I loved the 1st in this trilogy and I am hoping the last is better than this one. Don't waste your money, read one of her older books over again."
3,"Great Music, but sound quality is fair at best","The music on this cd is excellent. However this compilation is inferior to the now out of print Anthology (not to be confused with the one billboard is selling) that has ALL the hits in GLORIOUS TRUE STEREO. I also did not care for this cd's liner notes, which implied all the Supremes fans were black, but neither I or many others are. Basically this compilation is a waste & they should bring the old one back."
1,"""Re-mastering"" murders songs","I echo the above statement. I live in eternal regret because I can't buy the ""Supremes 25th Anniversary"" anthology (it seems to be out of print - maybe forever?). So, after buying the ""Supremes' Greatest Hits"" CDs, I bought this. For all their ability with music, Mowtown techs or the people they hire seem at times to not have a clue what they're doing... and it's not the first time or the first record I've found this!""Re-mastering""!?!? It seems as if somebody had set out to take these pop gems and try to make them sound as bad as possible - an incomprehensible travesty. I guess all I can do is get the ""Anthology""..."
1,Danger - Poor sound quality will hurt your ears!,"Motown CD's are among the worst for sound quality and this so-called ""remastered"" disc is no exception. I'm from Detroit. I love this music. But the CD sound is worse than the original 1960's records. There are less expensive Supreme's collections available -- the sound quality of those is also mediocre but at least they cost a few dollars less!"
2,Didn't like the sound.,A very poor version of upgrade. I did'nt like the sound quality at all. I was searching for the original sound
5,"Still better than ""The #1s"" collection","It's called 'The Ultimate Collection' and that ain't braggin'. And it's in glorious mono, not like the thinned out stereo versions on 'The #1s' set (do you get the feeling I really don't care for that ripoff?).David Lee Roth once described VanHalen's music as being ""shot from cannons"". Well, I can think of no better way to describe this disc. All 25 tracks are nothing less than explosive. And that's because they're in mono. The sound is so in your face it cannot be denied. This is one of the most thrilling discs you will ever hear.We all know the songs. My favorite one turned out to be not one of their biggest hits, but I think it's their best, ""Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart"". This may well be the most out of control Diana Ross has ever been. She sings within an inch of her life, she growls(!), she lives the song. Remarkable.So, put aside all the Dreamgirl drama you've heard and pick up this set... and skip 'The #1s'!"
2,BEWARE...IN THE NAME OF LOVE!,"This CD looks like a bootleg job. The artwork features the original Supremes but the recordings are not by Diana, Mary and Flo. These are the same recordings made by Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence many moons ago which keep creeping in all kinds of compilations from many different countries. Don't get me wrong. I think Scherrie and Lynda are fabulous singers and they have every right to bill themselves as Supremes but it is fraudulent to try to pass these cover tracks for originals. If you are looking for the classic recordings stick with Motown fare."
2,Poor sound quality on various tracks,"When they recorded the originals on this CD, many of the songs only reflect one of side of the stereo track. For example, if vocals were isolated on one track, then the song as recorded on this CD either contains the music side or the vocal side. I could have done a better job recording an LP to a cassette."
3,Shirley Valentine - Longman Edition,"This is the SCREENPLAY - not the stage version. Beware! I thought I was ordering the stage play. It's still a nice book though, with lots of notes and background info."
5,best microfiber cloth,"is thin but feels thick and is really good, since im waiting for a iphone 4s case meanwhile i just wrap my phone with it, just awesome! i wear glasses and use this every day on gadgets too.i have one in posted yellow, going to get a nother for the car."
3,"CONVERSATIONS, COUNTRY SYLE","So what is Dolly really like? And is she really that big? Those looking for such titillating tidbits should turn elsewhere. This collection of interviews with some of country's biggest names (Wynette, Judd, Jones, McEntire, Acuff, Pearl, Monroe) focuses more on the ""real"" side of the perfomer and person ... in other words, there's more talk of music and radio play than wigs and full figures and rhinestone cowboys. Nash, a veteran country music journalist, uses her comfortable, conversational style to get the people to open up. This reissue (the tome was first unleashed in 1988) doesn't offer anything we don't already know, but it's handy to keep on the shelf just in case you really want to know Emmylou's take on overdubs."
3,"""Phoney, but great...""","Indeed, an intriguing film, with some unexpected ""touching"" performances... to fit with the violence. Bordering on the edge of purely""possible conjecture and outright fantasy,"" it still makes for an engaging, interesting tale... based on skewered facts, and under-the-cover gossip. JFK (Oliver Stone) did it best. But this is not too far behind in the same race on a mythical track. It was an enjoyable surprise, nonetheless."
1,"[One and a half out of four] Poor followup to 'JFK', done to smear JFK!","Italian-American Danny Aiello givesheartfelt performance, but those ofus who have done any research intoJack Ruby, JFK, et, al know, he wasnowhere near like man portrayed inhere! And Aiello is about 6'2"", 260lbs., and the real Jakob Rubensteinwas about 5'8"" and 185! Also, thismovie and publishers squib on backcover make out like Oswald REALLYDID kill JFK, which anybody knowsDIDN'T happen! Plus, there is nosuch person as 'stripper' CandyKane! Movie made by HollywoodKhazars to exonerate Zionistand Masonic connection to JFK'skilling, with willing dupes play-ing supporting roles. This Revis-ionist Reviewer was not fooled!"
2,I am curious Rubenstein,"since one-half of my lineage is undoubtedly related to Jack, I am curious about all things Rubenstein, and this just came on The Box so I'm cking it out...but I have a beef...why does Hollywood persist in casting non-Jewish actors as Jewish characters, esp. Danny Aiello (in this and at least one other, which title I dis-remember, it's about Jewish widows in Pittsburgh(?)) are there NO jewish actors available to do this schlock and who can bring to the role, at the very least, an authentic rendering of ""schmuck"" and ""schlmiel""? Aw schucks, this whole thing schux! Aiello is just not believable when he says ""I'm Jewish""!zei gesundt, mit latkes, Shalom, Alex"
3,Miracle Worker DVD,"I was so happy to see this version of the movie out on DVD so I could show sections of it to my students as we read the book. The movie itself is great; however, the first half of it has narration dubbed in that the students found annoying, and I do agree with them. I didn't see the narration mentioned in the movie description, but I think it should be noted. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase and would purchase it again."
5,Nicely made movie,I rented this for my home schooled kids to watch after reading Helen Keller's biography. They really enjoyed it and I think the move really captures the reality of Helen's childhood and the amazing transformation she went through with Annie.
4,"Good, But Not the Best","The Miracle Worker with Melissa Gilbert was a good rendition of the story, but I prefer the other two versions to this one. Melissa Gilbert was greatly overshadowed by Patty Duke as Ann Sullivan, and she was really too old to be playing the part. All three versions were pretty much identical, except for the individuals playing the parts. In my opinion, the Miracle worker with Hallie Eisenberg was the best of the three. If you are interested in it because of Melissa Gilbert, don't expect too much. This version is all Patty Duke.It is a good movie, but not the best rendition."
2,Not the original,"Watch the original. Melissa Gilbert was way too old,big to play this role. Also, not including the opening scene of Helen as a baby, makes it a different story. I still cried at end but there was a lot of willing suspension of disbelief employed."
1,THE MIRACLE WORKER,MOVIE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE NEW AND WAS UNABLE TO WATCH COMPLETLY DUE TO IT QUIT PLAYING. VERY DISAPPOINTED. HAD BOUGHT FOR GRANDDAUGHTER WHO WAS DOING A REPORT ON HELEN KELLAR AND SHE WAS UNABLE TO VIEW INTIRE MOVIE DUE TO LOW QUALITY.
4,Very slept on artist,"Ronnie's CD was decent. He has a very versatile voice, however due to bad marketing and contract/ label disputes - he never had the chance to shine the way he should have. This CD has a great remake of Rose Royce's ""Next to you"" plus the only single to be released, ""What are we gonna do"" about teenage pregnancy. Give this CD a listen and I'm sure you'll be hooked and begin searching for more music from this kid. He wrote ""2000 Watts"" on Michael Jackson's INVINCIBLE CD. The song isn't that good but Ronnie's vocals are in the background. If you can find this CD, pick it up - you'll be glad you did."
4,3 of Hearts- Has a Great Writer,"Rarely does a new pop group come aboard with such a fine song that fits them like a glove. LOVE IS ENOUGH, written by Jim Varsos (Alaskas Hobo Jim) is the perfect ditdy to start these girls off to cyber-stardom. They still have a long way to go from shopping centers to Carnegie Hall. Still, with great writers like Jim Varsos behind them, they will continue to climb to Billboard heaven. The best thing 3 of Hearts could do is sign up Jim and a couple of other top notch writers and let them produce the material while the girls concentrate on doing what girls do best..."
2,This Is Enough,"With this CD, you can easily tell that all three of the girls are vocally very talented but the song writer is not. These girls could have deserved a better song to sing.""Love Is Enough"" is basically a sweet, innocent, upbeat song thats very country influenced. Though with one listen, you can tell these girls are very talented, this isn't a very good debut single. If they're hoping to make an impression in the music buisness, they should have came out with a strong tune.Its too early to tell though. This is just their first single and I'm sure there are many more to come along with their album. Hopefully, they would have better songs on their album."
5,Classy lady,"One of the golden girls of the 20's,I have all these recordings on lps but I just had to have them on a cd, I am glad someone took the time to put it together and it is great but I hope the next one includes some of her less known songs. If you are into unique voices and great sounds of American music from the 1920's this is a must."
4,Actually Pretty Good,"When this group came out, it seemed as that they had a promising future with their first single ""Tell Me ( I'll Be Around), but after their second single ""Serenade"" you didn't hear from them again. I purchase the album last year out of curiosity, and it was pretty good for the time that it came out. If they had better marketing then they probably still be around."
5,Make this your next buy,It is a great cd full of great songs and is truely a great buy. I can not stop listening to it. I can't till they come out with another cd. Can you please make the picture bigger or an option to make it bigger because I try to print out the cover 4 my friend to buy it but it is really small and my friend can not see what the cover looks like.
5,The bishops wife,such a beautiful story. david niven and loretta young and of course cary grant were fantastic in it as always.I truly loved it.it was a message inside of the movie in the movie. which I thought I got.
1,"The cost, the horror!","Asking $38.60 for this DVD is outrageous, ridiculous and borders on usury, theft and highway robbery! When it has collected enough dust on your shelf and you lower the price to a realisxtic one, let me know.As good and enjoyable as this film is that price is insane!"
1,The bishop's wife,"I had to return this movie due to the sound not matching the movement of the actor's mouths when they were talking. I'm not sure what the deal was, very annoying"
3,Don't miss the remake also!,"I liked this remake even more than the original and I love old movies best! Check out ""The Preachers Wife""."
2,Disappointing Christmas Fare,"I'd heard about this movie all my life, so on a whim I purchased it from Amazon and settled down with my eggnog for a holiday treat. Was I disappointed! I'd expected something on the caliber of It's a Wonderful Life. Instead, I thought this movie was shallow and contrived. It's an insipid story line about how a nice angel improves everyone's attitude by doing a few parlor tricks like straightening files and providing a never-ending bottle of whiskey. Loretta Young's character wallowed in subservient self-pity. David Niven's cold portrayal of her bishop husband didn't warm up much, even after the angel's visit. I didn't really care for any of the characters, and found myself yawning. The film was nominated for Best Picture after its 1940s release, so I'm sure there's a host of Americans who disagree with me, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
4,Christmas Lover's Triangle?,"What to do? You're an Episcopal Bishop who feels an angel is movin' in on your wife... and you've been overburdened trying to get a cathedral built! This is a nice 'old' classic for middle-agers and above to watch together (nothing here to keep the interest of children or teens). Fine performances by Cary Grant, David Niven and Loretta Young. It an enjoyable movie, though I find the ice-skating sequence too long and drawn out."
4,Choice Role For Cary Grant,"Like ""Life With Father,"" also issued in 1947, this is an old-fashioned ""nice"" film. Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven make up an impressive trio of stars, but Grant has the best role. He makes the best of it, too, with expressions on his face that are funnier than most of the lines he delivers.One not-so-family oriented thing he does, however, as the ""angel,"" is go out on dates with the bishop's wife (Young). No respectable married woman, especially back then, would ever do that. At least the two of them recognize this fact later. Niven plays the bishop and, as usual in the film world, is portrayed as a weak clergyman.Nonetheless, it is a charming, feel-good movie that entertains through most of it. There are a few special-effects in here, too, that are good even by today's standards. One example would be the Christmas tree lighting scene.This would make a good Christmas movie for people looking for suitable films during that holiday."
1,Only for sentimental junkies,"This holiday classic is about a suave, miracle-making angel who mends the relationship between a bishop and his wife. However, his methods are quite unorthodox. He makes subtle moves on the wife and incites jealousy in the bishop. The bishop then realizes how much he loves his wife and wants to spend more time with her. How ridiculous is that? The bishop is not motivated by a love of his values. Instead, he is motivated by the fear of losing his values. Unless you've been brainwashed by Christian ethics, don't waste your time watching this movie."
4,Christmas Classic,"A great movie at Christmas or year round for that matter. Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven, and Monty Woolley are fantastic. The mix of drama and comedy are prefect.Anyone that enjoys Cary Grant of David Niven will love this movie. The director does a great job of keeping us enchanted with just enough reality and a hint of heavenly powers. The sets, music, and supporting cast are excellent.I hope we will see another classic movie with Monty Woolley put on DVD, The Pied Piper (1942), which has him rescuing children from occupied France during WWII. I can't even find it on VHS.The quality of this movie is excellent. They did a great job of restoring it and transferring it to DVD. There are a few extras included, but the movie alone is worth the price."
1,Good Movie; Really poor quality DVD,Don't buy this copy! It is a great Movie but MGM printed it with 2 burn spots that ruin the movie.My VHS copy is in better shape than that!!
3,"""not so impressed""","i recently purchased this undertail and i wasn't too impressed, because the brake light assy cant be mounted like it could on its original undertail.It's held in place with a double sided foam tape that can come off over time. I had to stuff the space with a piece of rubber just to make sure if the sticker(double sided tape)does come off the brake light stay in place.I wasn't too impress with the mounting bracket it came with and the drilling you have to do to mount it. I also think its too pricy!!"
2,I like my books to be edited first.,"This book is captivating if you're browsing, but it's virtually useless as a research tool. The writing is full of flaws--sentences are mangled, thoughts are buried under odd syntax, typos are everywhere. Greenwood needs to take their time and stop churning out this stuff without SERIOUS pre-publishing revisions."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED,"Trust me, you will not get a ""Pack of 6"" boxes of N'ICE Cherry lozenges. You will get a single box.N'ICE Cherry lozenges are great, but you should not place an order under this false listing."
4,First one,"The first one of Coelho's saga of mystical books.Great book. Teaching useful things in life as expected.Just like magic, you won't be able to stop reading it. Paulo Coelho, in a very sweet way of writing, involves you in his journey in Santiago de Compostela. Also, invites you to know that beautiful journey by yourself. You 'll feel encouraged."
5,Good book for the personal visionquest!,Follow coelho and his adventures in Spain. Good exercises follow each section to help you develop along life's journey. What would it be like to have committment? What would it be like to learn about yourself in a whole new way? This is a good book for the personal visionquest.
4,"Interesting, but need to try harder...","I found this CD after watching ""Collateral"". The music sounds very interesting when classic melodies blended with swing and jazz. But they sticked to the originial notes too much. I wish they could have created more variations and improvisation. Also, in this ""Classic Meets Cuba"" CD, the Cuba part needs to be emphasized more (putting them into a central stage in some tracks; the solo in the Fur Elise track is a good example) rather than treating the percussion beats as peripheral background. Taking the advantage of these vivid beats could further set the musicians free from the original notes. Overall, this is a good CD and is perfect for smooth jazz lover. Hope they can try harder and do more in their up-coming new release-Jazz Meets Cuba."
3,the first part is good but...,"the first part of the video is classic wrestling from the 60s featuring Bobo Brazil, antonio rocca, gorgeous george, etc. but the second part featuring wrestling from 70s and 80s was not impressive although they were in color. i thought that the whole video was from the 60s as seen on the cover but they mixed it with something else as a filler i guess."
5,Give me the music!,"I don't want the gossip, I want the music. Nelson George gives that to us in this excellent book. Yeah, there are some cool insider/gossip tales here, but it doesn't overwhelm the reader.We hear in detail about how Berry Gordy rose up from a humble existence to create the greatest recording company in the history of music. We read how Holland-Dozier-Holland crafted some of the greatest songs ever, and how the finest backup band, The Funk Brothers, put it all together behind some elite singers. George breaks it all down very well, doesn't pull punches, yet doesn't overreach. No bias here for against artists, producers, musicians, and singers: It's written like evenly across the board.A must-read for not just soul music fans, but anyone interested in a great American story."
1,first spaceship on venus,"the movie is a great movie, but this version was not good. the vocals start talking 5 seconds before there lips move. this movie was not meant for wide screen. alot of it was caught off on top & bottom. thank you! JESUS LOVES YOU!"
5,Fantastic book!!,"It is funny how different people can have so many conflicting opinions about the same book. The author interviewed some of the most famous and successful investors in the country. You have to be out of your mind not to come away with something useful. The lessons are not obvious, at least to this humble long-term investor. Maybe if you know everything about the stock market, then devising a strategy, creating rules, cutting your losses, holding winners, minimizing risk by using dollar cost averaging, avoiding trading options and futures and 101 other lessons might be common-sense, but not to me.Bottom line: One of the best books I have read on investing in the stock market."
4,Very good for a beginner.,This book was the first book I read about the stock market and I found it an easy read and it opened up my mind for the stock market. Acctually it gave me a different view. Much more relaxed view if you like. At the same time I found the author repeting himself too often. You will need further reading but this book is a good beginner and it also plays a role as a guide for further reading.
5,Awesome,The book is written in an easy to read interview format. Sincere delves into the minds of some of the brightest and best on Wall Street.This belongs on every investor's shelf.
5,Great Interviews,This book is simply a delight to read. I would rank his interviews up there with Jack Schwager and the Market Wizards.
1,Hackneyed Cliches and One Liners,"Do you think you'll really get rich reading a book of hackneyed investment cliches and one liners written by an academic????? If yes, this is the book for you. But if you live in the real world like the rest of us, and think you need more help and information before investing real money, then pass on this on. I read half the book in the store and decided not to waste any more time or money, so I didn't buy the book."
1,Worthless,"Printed about 1/2 of a page before it ran out. it feels heavy as if it has ink in it, but it wont print. it's cheap, but dont bother.EDIT: They (vision supplies) did issue a refund even though it was out the return period."
5,Great customer service!,"The first cartridge we got didn't work. Based on the lights on the printer, it didn't recognize it as the correct cartridge. The company not only sent us a new one, but they were quick about it too!"
3,Ink Cartridge dried up or empty,I ordered two of the same item. First one worked great. Put in second one less than a month later and it is dry as a bone. Because the return window has expired it is more costly for me to return the item and pay for additional shipping than to just toss it in the trash.
1,HERE'S THE FIX! maybe,I got this. It was printing poorly from the start.It had clogged inkjets.>Boil cup of water>Add small about of rubbing alcohol>Submerse bottom half of cartridge with the ink jets>Wait 2 minutes.>Then it works perfect.(edit) worked great for 1 day. i can not recommend this cartridge
5,hp FAX black ink cartridge HP 15,Ordered two HP 15 black re-manufactured cartridges from OC.Cartridges arrived fast and were very inexpensive!My hp 950 FAX/printer/scanner/etc. is working very well.
5,Cheap and works,"I've been skeptical of rebuilt ink cartridges but this one was so cheap I decided to take a chance on it.Well it came quick, and so far has worked fine so I'm happy."
2,Frozen Cartridge??,"Got it in winter, I think it froze.Ink was dripping out of it inside the sealed bag.What a mess to open and take out, and stinks too!Probably will buy local next time."
5,Way cheaper then new ink.,"I bought this for my HP Deskjet 842C, it's an ancient printer lol. Our main Canon printer ran out of ink and the prices for one of those inks we're like $30-40!! There was nothing wrong with my old printer, it was just old. Boys like to play with new toys so we neglected the old printer. I did a comparison of the two printer's inks and to re-arm the newer printer it would cost between $50-60. So I bought the colour/black ink off Amazon for.. $18 lol. Much better option.Tested it on a coupon and it works perfectly. No problems thus far, will update if problem arises."
1,Used it ONCE before it evidently ran out of ink,"I don't know if I was duped into buying an inferior product, or I was the victim of an oversight on the company's part, but I am definitely not happy with this cartridge. I literally used my printer ONCE after installing it, (and printed only a few pages.) I don't know what the deal is, but a major thumbs down to this company."
5,Must Have Diabetic Product,"I purchased this item with prior Item experience , This is the best product I have ever used.It is a must have for controlling blood sugar spikes IT WORKS GREAT my blood sugar stabilized after use of the Extend Bar!"
4,Peanut butter chocolate delight,I really like this flavor of the ExtendBar. First time I have tried them. I eat 1/2 of the bar before bedtime and my sugars are great in the morning. Definitely recommend this product.
5,Great Tasting,"Compare to other nutritional bars out there you'll find these are one of the few that are low in calories (150) and pack a good amount of protein (11 grams), and they taste great! I love these bars."
2,Not so good,"This product may help with your blood sugar but I really did not like the taste . I tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter, Peanut Butter, Apple Cinamon and their Berry flavor. Did not like any of them!"
1,Inedible,"They taste dusty. Mdh, the original garage disposer, took one bite, made an ugly face, and threw the rest away. Just because it's diabetic, doesn't mean it can't taste good."
5,Diabetic,With so many products claiming to help with Blood sugars this is the first that actually does. I use them before excercise and if I need a little boost to get me through the night. Morning blood sugars have remained consistant and my last A1C was a 6.5. Not bad for a 25 year Type 1 diabetic. Great product
3,"Tasty, Healthy, but over-priced","I've tried some of these bars, both getting a sampler from the manufacturer, and this box. I like the bars, and they work for me as a diabetic. I'm very glad that there are companies making products like this. Unlike some others I do genuinely enjoy the taste. But in the end I feel that at nearly $2/ea, they are pretty over-priced. There are other products, like from Atkins and South Beach that are just as tasty and healthy, but much less expensive."
3,crunchy?,why is it crunchy? It doesnt say cruchy like some of their other products so I thought it would be creamy.
5,Amazing Gift Book: A True Golfing Revery,Durrance has struck gold with his poignant look at the people of golf. His hallmark photography is stunning but only a step ahead of the funny and touching description of his brief time with each subject. He is to be commended for such stellar work completed in such a short period - three months. The range of characters - from professionals to the most rank amateurs - presents a sweeping view of the golf world that will find resonance in anyone who enjoys the game. This book is the perfect gift for any or all of the golfers in your life.
5,cute book,"I bought this book for my niece, who loves it! I have a pug so my niece feels connected to the book a lot more. The pictures are great too."
4,For the love of a Pug,"This is a very cute book. Our toddler has a pet Pug, so the book is pretty entertaining. I love the artwork, and the verse is cute."
5,teaching my little one to read,"My 3 year old loves this book. It is very simple with sentences such as, ""Pug tugs and tugs. No, Pug, no"" for example. It has words with similar phonics, and sounds. Pug, hug, rug, tug are the first words my daughter can read! The story is not engaging, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be repetitive. I hope to find more of this series. If you're looking for early readers with engaging stories and pics, try the Mercy Watson series.Mercy Watson to the Rescue"
2,Pass.,"Picked this up at our local library's book sale and glad I got this c h e a p. Not much to it. It's a primer (as the title reflects) and, outside of the ""Pug's Hugs"" rhyme, lacks adorability that belongs to the Pug. It might be a very good phonics teacher for some children, I just can't tell. Our two children weren't really interested in it and our little boy just loves his two real, live Pugs and our other assorted Pugabilia so it didn't float his boat either."
2,alittle too generic,"The book on a whole covers a vast amount of information. As a text book however, it is very generic in giving clear answers to questions that might be seen on an exam. This can be difficult when taking a test and you are asked for a specific answer. Most of the information covered deals directly with OHSHA, which can be obtained on- line for free. It is a very thick book though and some might possibly think it worth the value just for the mere impressive size."
5,Classic,I love The Early November. I think Ace has done an wonderful job with creating lyrics that bring up emotions. If anyone needs to hear a terrific band please buy this album..better yet buy this one and then buy The Rooms Too Cold. You will be in love
5,**********Best Album they Made************,"This album is true Early November. When they all enjoyed the same music and they all had the same idea of their style. Hands down, this is the best album they ever put out. Period. For all of this is amazing."
3,Take time and find,"This EP from The Early November is a good set of modern rock songs inspired by probably anything that is ""Emo"". They sound quite similar from the other bands of Drive-thru records and for that it's hard to say if they can stand out and become anything. I think they have the potential if they find themselves as an individual band. I'm not trying to bad mouth the band for being well, what they are, it's just that their music doesn't stand out lets say like Dashboard Confessional or Jimmy eat World of today's modern rock crowd. 'I Want To Hear You Sad' and 'Take Time and Find' are good songs though, I wish this band luck. It's not like I have a band so rock on boys."
5,"Awesome EP, look forward to hearing from them in the future","The Early November is a band with which I have been very pleasantly surprised. Being a big fan of Drive-Thru's artists, especially Something Corporate, this is by far one of the best DTR albums put out in a while. If you like this EP by TEN, then I highly recommend you purchase the acoustic EP that is put out exclusively on the DTR website. Their songs were made for the acoustic guitar, and they are definitely a band I look forward to hearing more from in the future."
5,THE EARLY NOVEMEBER is GREAT,"This is a new band on the drivethru label that I love so much. this CD is amazing. These guys are going to blow up for sure, so you should get this CD as soon as possible, so you can be the first one out of everyone you know to have it. You should also check out their awesome acoustic CD availiable at the drivethru site..."
3,To much terminology,"To my opinion the second part of the book it goes too deep into Buddhist terminology and into theories beyond the apprehension of a western reader.The theory of emptiness and complicated issues of high level Buddhist philosophy shouldn't have been a part of a book with the title ""healing anger""!"
5,Best Soap on the Market,"I have sensitve skin, I've tried using expensive products (name brands - you know what that are), but once I was introduced to this soap, this is the best. This soap clears any irritations that the other products causes, and does not dry out your skin. This soap is the only soap I use on my face now and it leaves my face flawless. Most of the times, I grab this soap to clear my face from other products (and is about $100.00 cheaper) which breaks my face out. So when I want a smooth, flawless face, I will go to Grandpa Old Fashioned Oatmeal Soap. The Oatmeal in this soap does not scratch your skin like other products does. This soap clears your face better than any top brand or expensive product on the market. Truth me, I've tried nearly all of them, thats why I'm glad to be using this Grandpa's soap for the other products irritated my skin. I normally purchased this soap from another vendor, but found it $1.00 less through Amazon."
4,Classic Milt Jackson,"I have owned a vinyl copy of this album for many years and it has long been a favorite. It has a mostly bright and cheerful sound - very much in keeping with the ""samba"" theme - without compromising the jazz feeling and virtuosity that Milt Jackson brings to all his work. Personnel varies slightly between some of the tracks, three of which comprise vocals. Amongst the main participants are tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath, the ever-reliable Tommy Flanagan on piano and Connie Kay on drums. The CD case reproduces the original record covers, including Leonard Feather's liner notes and the technical quality of the recording is amazingly good, considering that it was recorded in 1964. Fine jazz for a summer night ! Highly recommended."
4,Music from one more Paradise Lost,"These recordings were made 'in the field', mic in hand, by Unesco in the 1950's and are an absolutely unique report of a world forever lost, before being butchered by the atrocities of the Rwanda genocide, while 'civilization' looked the other way.Music qualities range from intense drumming, which will sent any rock/jazz afficianado straight to heaven, to the tenderest of singing by for instance a young girl, recorded with the wind sizzling audibly around her in the bushes, and a blind singer evoking from a one-string instrument a gamut of inflexions and feelings.I still have the LP I once purchased in the late 1970's and was overjoyed to find this unique material re-recorded on this cd.If you wanna travel the river upstream to find one of the main sources of our musical history, here is where to begin."
3,cute!!,"I love this tea cup. I'm going to use as a small mug for water or tea. But when I opened the box, I was so surprised that one cup was not wraped at all.(I ordered 6) Fortunately, there was no damage in the cup."
4,nice boots.,"These are really handsome boots. Comfortable too. they are a bit heavy, but they are also quite stout. my only complaint is that it appears that the leather lower is separating from the upper sole. Now, there are no holes or tears.. it just looks like its separating. so far they are holding up, but I am concerned that they could separate completely with hard use. I don't use these as work boots. just casual shoes. I would venture to say that these may not be the most reliable durable boot out there for the working man. If you want a boot for hard working to make a living on, check out wesco boots or whites.for the money, they are good for me."
1,Expensive and Ineffective,"I have been using the Princereign Ingrown Hair and Razor Bump Gel every day for over a month now and while I wasn't expecting miraculous results, I can't see any difference whatsoever in the bumps and ingrown hairs on my bikini line. It didn't irritate my skin or anything, and it wasn't drying or stinky, it just didn't do anything at all."
5,Best stuff Ever!,I've used this for over a month now and see fantastic results!More effective than tend skin for me. I have less ingrown hairs and I don't think I'll use anything else!Great product.
5,Loved it But Packaging could have been better,The Item was exactly what I wanted and needed but when it was shipped to me the bottles were not completely sealed and leaked into the box Not too much. My suggestion would be double check the lids before sealing.
2,Is it working???,"I've gotten it twice, but honestly don't know if it works... can't tell the difference when using vs not using."
2,How many times a day?,"I get waxed monthly because shaving causes me so much irritation. I get ingrown hairs pretty often though and got this product on a recommendation from my waxer. I was so hopeful this would solve all my problems, but I have not seen very much change since beginning to use the product. First of all, I exfoliate frequently and used this product (you are supposed to use it 2 times a day- that's a pain!). Other than a slightly reduced (very slight) amount of ingrowns, I can not say this has done a single thing for me. I am off to try another similar product and am hopeful about better results."
3,"Too Pricey, Not enough results",Ive been using this product for a couple of weeks and already the bottle is half gone. It did help my ingrowns but I still had to go with my tweezers and pulls the hair out. This product wasn't as good as i had imagined and for the price and size of the bottle I will not be buying this again.
1,No Relief,I bought this after doing a lot of research and hearing such great reviews. I have used it twice a day for over two months hoping that with more use I would start to see some effect. I have had horrible ingrown hairs on my bikini line for as long as I can remember. I was hoping that this product would provide me with some small relief but it did not have any effect whatsoever. Perhaps this product is designed to relieve razor bumps more so than ingrown hairs-although I till experienced the terribly painful irritation that corresponds with ingrown hairs. I realize this has worked for many but did nothing for me. I am extremely disappointed and am now on the hunt for a new miracle. Any suggestions?
2,Hasn't worked yet,"While the gel was shipped to me promptly, and is easy to use, I haven't really seen any results yet - granted, I haven't been using it strictly twice a day, so that could be the reason. The directions say to apply morning and night to clean dry skin after shaving - does that mean they want me to shave twice a day?"
3,Prince Reign's review,"I really wanted to like this product because of the previous reviews i'd read. Unfortunately, I wouldn't exactly recommend it to people with razor bumps. I think the product is mainly marketing hype. I do like the scent of the gel but if you are looking for a product that will show results I can't say this is it. At the very best it works a little bit but thats not saying much"
4,"Not perfect, but better than anything else","Works pretty well, but I still get bumps that don't go away. The key is exfoliating in addition to using a product like this, but I still haven't found anything that keeps me bump-free. This stuff at least smells good; I just wish it weren't so expensive. It also takes forever for the package to arrive (though it always does eventually).I found something at Duane Reade, while I was waiting for my latest shipment, called Bikini Zone, that smells a little harsh, but works about as well as Princereigns."
5,Great Help,"I have not received a product yet...but I just got off the phone with Princereign rep...for the first time in my life I got actually helpful tips on how to deal with my problem of ingrown hair. I've had this problem forever, and for the first time ever I was actullaly given suggestions an valid explanations on how to deal with my problem. If these guys are this helpful before I even tried their product...OK now I have tried the product for about a week, no the results are not instantaneous, but the improvement is amazing, the deeply embeded ingrowns are beginning to come out, I am extremly pleased.:)"
3,Princereings Gel,"I must say I was a little skeptical at first with this product, but it turned out to be pretty good. It works slow but it does work. You'll need more than one bottle if you really want to get the full benefit of this treatment."
3,Wishes,"Although I found Tin City to be an interesting read, I was really put off by the snide digs at religion, conservatives and Fox News. Why is it that some authors insist on dragging their uber-liberal viewpoints into otherwise good novels? Why is it that Housewright insists on insulting at least half of his readers? Probably his background in the 'progressive' swamps of academia and journalism makes him believe that everyone is of the same stripe. I sure hope he realizes sooner rather than later that many of us are religious, conservative Fox News viewers."
4,This is LOCO!!! [in a good way],Itz amazing how they sound like they've been speaking spanish since birth....absolutely lovely....if u want to get into a romantic mood....this cd's for you. As always BoyzIImen hit that note...oh so rite!!! Ensoy!
1,cat off deodorizer,"I did not like this product....and will not use....it said it was unscented....but I found it VERY perfumed and noxious.....when I called to return, they said there would be a 20% restocking fee....that plus the shipping didn't seem worth it....so....it was a waste"
4,Good for Day Trips,"I debated between the small and the medium bag because the medium bag was enormous on my small frame (5'2""). After many trips to the city, I found the small bag to hold up nicely. However, now that I am going on an international trip, I feel like I should have gotten the medium sized bag. Also, with a larger lens (Nikon D60 with 18-200mm lens), I found that I had to reconfigure the inside compartments so the camera lays from left to right rather than top to bottom. This forces me to configure the rest of the compartments oddly so I lost one of the four additional squares I had.The construction of the bag is very high quality and the added rain bag is a plus. It's made of a soft canvas with heavy duty straps for carrying larger items outside of the pack. Unless you have a netbook, don't count on a real computer fitting in the back. I couldn't even get my work laptop (15"") to fit.Overall, I love the bag. I just wish it was a bit bigger but not as bulky as the medium one."
5,More than Expectation,"I bought this backpack for my Sony SLT-A55V Camera, It stores my Camera with 18-250 lens attached to it. It also stores lens filters. Also it carries my Sony Camcorder with all accesories.It has more pockets than needed, so keep more of your accessories.The best part it, It fits in my Sony Vaio 14.5"" screen Laptop comfortably with charger.I have travelled with this to Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam and this product did come in HandyAll in one, I would definately recommend this to anybody who has to store more than a Camera."
3,"Great bag, but not for me...","I didn't know if I wanted the small or the medium, so I ordered both. First off, awesome bags. Well made, with the exception of the Velcro not lining up with the pocket. I really, really, really wanted to love this bag, but it just looks sooooo HUGE and unattractive on my back. I tried to pat it down so it wasn't as bulky, but even empty it was huge. I would have used this bag everywhere I go when I've got my camera, and I would have thought people were giving nerdy looks at all the places.Give it a try... you may love it. Excellent bag, but wasn't for me."
3,Small!,"Extremely useful backpack, fit for Canon Rebel with lens plus 2 other lenses, room for iPad, but there is not much space left. NeXT time I Will buy the medium one. Very small on my back, it looks like I am carrying a child's backpack."
5,Excellent Choice,"A wonderful choice for advanced amateurs, especially those who already have EOS lenses and flashes. The resolution is high enough for any consumer application, and the firmware updates from Canon solve many earlier glitches."
4,Great learning tool!,"This camera was the best investment in my photography that I could have imagined. Without the cost and concern of film and processing, I was free to make as many photos as I wanted, and to adjust the settings to learn about the effect of such control. With my EOS lenses, my existing investment was prolonged. I have printed and posted much of my work, and the quality has met or exceeded local labs."
3,Canon D 30 nice but a couple of problems,"I consider myself an advanced amateur. Just got a new D 30 and found two issues: a 128MB Microtech card, formatted in the camera, would take 10 photos and then freeze the camera. I have to take out the camera battery to ""reboot"" the camera. This is very disturbing, the same card has been working with no problems on another camera and a Microtech reader.I tried a smaller capacity San Disk card (32MB) and had no problems.Continuing the same tradition as in other Canon products, the small print limited warranty card does not mention any extended service agreements for sale (as other manufacturers offer), so I have to assume that if the camera breaks down after a year, I am facing high repair costs.The camera takes nice photos, but I now regret I didn't wait until Nikon comes out with a competitive (price and features) model."
3,Expensive,"I used it at my school once, but I did not find it worth the steep price tag. I would reccommend sticking with a cheaper megapixel camera which has the same photo quality, though it may lack the bells and whistles."
1,awful writing by insecure desperate for attention author,"Desperately insecure author trying to be ""edgy"" and ""out there."" This is the the kind of silliness an 8th grader would write and his friends would call it ""freaky."" They would giggle over the ""naughty words.""I can just hear Butthead: ""Huh, huh, huh....he said f--k.""I am so very sorry that I bought this book. The sexual themes and terminology were NOT offensive at all. Rather, they were tedious and boring. It was the author's way of jumping up and down, ""Hey look at me!! See, I am shocking. I am hip. I break rules and defy convention. I am a rebel.""Yeah, yeah, yeah Carlton, we get it. You are ""different.""If you want something ""creepy"" that is well crafted and has soul, try Hubert Selby Jr."
5,Don't believe the Bad reviews!,"I don't know what the bad reviews regarding this book are about. After reading a couple of the bad reviews I have come to the conclusion that these negative reviews are of a personal nature; an attack on the author, not the book itself. Anyway, regardless, this book has more creative images and situations than many of the books I've read. I read this book in a single sitting and I have to say it was well worth the time. This is a book that will stick in your head for weeks after you've put it down. Buy this book. Buy all of Carlton Mellick's books. You will not regret it!"
2,Maybe it's me...,"Let me first start by saying that I like reading many different types of books and picked this one as an introduction to a genre and author that is new to me. Okay, now I can say that I was not impressed. I felt this book was gross for the sake of being gross. I was not offended by the disgustingness of it, but found it gratuitous. If the writing had been more lyrical I would have liked it more. That being said, after reading one particularly good previous review (by J.R. Uder) I think I can safely say that I just don't get it. Maybe you have to be a man to enjoy this book or maybe I simply just can't see the world from this particular perspective. So my opinion remains that I just was not impressed."
5,Classic Bizarro,"I think of this as a companion piece to CM3's The Baby Jesus Butt Plug, but this one's a bit more adult (which, I suppose, you can take a number of different ways - and they all apply). It's disturbing, it's funny, and it's oddly touching (I suppose you could take that a couple different ways too. And THAT too!). Anyway, this is classic Bizarro. There's a lot going on here, and the ride is a lot of fun."
3,"well, hello there","Man this one is weird. I mean, holy moly.It's about a man who is a sex toy. The whole book reads like one long sex scene. It's not that arousing. Well, sometimes it is, but it shouldn't be read as porn. It's way too surreal.The endings very poetic. And Mellicks writing style in this one reminded me of Burroughs.Still, a must read for Mellick fans."
3,X-rated bizarro,"This is probably Carlton Mellick III's most erotic story. I won't bother going over the plot as it was explained in many other reviews in details. But I will say this, if you're relatively new to the bizarro genre, I suggest you wait before reading this one. It's quite experimental (even for bizarro) and unless you realy like hardcore erotic stories, you'll probably find it quite repulsing.But if that's your kind of thing, this story will fascinate you. CM3 has a unique imagination it shows with this one."
3,Great background information,"This is a great companion volume to The Fourteen Friends Guide to Eldercaring. I bought them both, and reading this book helped undertand some of the issues I was facing, with the Fourteen Friends helped me with more practical things. I recommend them both."
4,This book aids in better understanding between generations,"I am a retiree who appreciated the style and content of this helpful book. I agree with the author that we who grew up in the Depression were influenced by having to be frugal, living with cast-offs, making our own way in life. Those of us who were in the services in WWII learned how to be separated from family and loved ones and to survive. After we became parents we found that family structure and expectations changed drastically. Major adjustments came with affluence, new roles for the sexes, and new technology. ""Another World"" is a guide book for both older and younger people. I bought the book to give to my adult children."
5,excellent - informative and a must read,This book reminds us all to be a kinder and gentler person - we are missing the front porches and piazzas of other days and other generations. The supportive web of relationships has weakened for us all - and particularly for the older generation which has lost many of its contemporaries. It is not necessary to read in detail the case histories; I think the value of the book lies in its overall impact and should be a mandatory text in human development courses.
1,Unfortunately Mary Phiper misses the point.,"While I have found Mary Phiper's other books very informative unfortunately she misses the point in our countries dealings with older people. She seems to hold on to many stereotypes of older people that, according to current research are simply not true. For example, I got the impression from reading her book that this country does not take care of their elderly and other countries do a better job. If one reviews the current research in this area one would find this is not the case. Families do care about their parents, grandparents and assist them in many ways. At least one child lives within 10 minutes and other family members do stay close dispite the distance. Her writings seem to be based on her observations with a limited number of people, while she avoids the current research on the topic. Please read with a critical eye otherwise you too will fall into believing the old stereotypes of the elderly."
4,"Insightful, useful look at aging","In ""Another Country,"" the acclaimed Mary Pipher of ""Reviving Ophelia"" discusses the issues surrounding caring for the aged, and aging itself. Her explanations surrounding the cultural gap between the baby boomers and their aged parents are interesting, as are the case studies, which are just grim enough to be realistic.A minor flaw is that the book is very much focused on the boomers and *their* aging parents, which makes its appeal to the non-boomer audience limited. Added to which, she does not cover the poor, destitute, or those who have no one to support them. A good book, if not as complete as it might have been."
4,Small Consolation.,"WITH DEEPEST SYMPATHY is a small and simple book that is written for those who have recently lost a loved one. The book is filled with scripture and various quotes, arranged in such a way to help lift one's spirit and prevent depression from taking a stonghold. I recently gave this book to a close friend of mine who lost a parent and she really enjoyed it."
4,interesting but kinda dragged a bit too far and too long,"kinda fun still. pls read michael moore's two non-fictions 'downsize this', 'dude, where's my country?' and then read donald westlake's 'the ax', to get a more realistic picture of america's corporates downsizing process started from the 90s, then you have to read some other books about america's 'outsourcing' problem in 21st century. i just don't know how long america could survive the prosperity, if all the working class simply can't find jobs anymore in this country."
1,At least i didn't waste the time watching reality tv.,"This book was trash. Shallow, implausible, moronic plotlines and a writing style that is simulatiously glib and overwritten. The characters were heavy-handed and one-sided. A waste of three hours. And somebody please tell this guy to quit using the phrase ""fait accompli""--once is enough."
2,Dinosaur Club will benefit from Harrison Ford,"Warner Bros. reportedly paid a million bucks for this, and it will undoubtedly benefit from Harrison Ford in the tailor-made lead role of a still gorgeous and fit 50-something executive who takes on the snotty 30-something preppies (Xander Berkeley, Jay Mohr) who try to downsize a big company, bedding a younger female lawyer (Elizabeth Shue) along the way. As a thriller with something to say, though, it doesn't make a particularly satisfying experience-- that rock-hard hero is straight out of Tom Clancy, which only tends to remind you that this ISN'T how it would all work out in real life. And the humor is often crude (there's a fat foulmouthed yenta who really drives home the point that the author is NOT a woman), while the revenge the dinosaurs get on the yupposaurs is more vicious than ingenious. Still, none of these are problems that Hollywood won't be able to fix..."
5,Quick delivery. Great price.,"I have had this necklace for years and it is still in good condition. I do wish it was a bit more sparkly but I didn't buy real diamonds so... I have gotten a lot of compliments and I mentioned I had gotten it on Amazon and the seller's name. Hopefully, others have purchased due to the recommendation."
3,Well... you get what you pay for,"I purchased this recently, and I found that the pendant is actually quite pretty. The chain, however, was disappointing. I am inclined to agree with others when they claimed that the chain does look flimsy and/or cheap-looking (which, in retrospect may have been the intended effect because you do pay more attention to the pendant with that type of chain.) I would have been ok with it if it wasn't way too short (certainly not 18 inches). At least the chain fits my Teddy Bear nicely! But for ten bucks, I really shouldn't complain. My suggestion - buy the pendant, ditch the chain and you'll be satisfied with this purchase."
4,They Deserved More Attention,"A quote from Gladys herself - ""Diana & the Supremes, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye were given all the hits while we took the leftovers."" That was on her A&E; biography, and she had a point, her group deserved more. They had some great hits though, her version of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" is one I still listen to, sometimes more than I listen to Marivn Gaye's version. ""Neither One of Us"" is just a wonderful song, and their version of ""I Wish It Would Rain"" is just as great as the Temptations' version. ""If I Were Your Woman"" is a Gladys classic. They had a great sound and Motown should have treated them better.This CD doesn't really deserve five stars though. Maybe if ""Every Beat of My Heart"", ""Midnight Train to Georgia"", ""Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me"", etc. were on here, you'd see five stars instead of four."
3,Mejor en dos volúmenes,"André Castelot escribió una biografía de Napoleón en dos volúmenes. El primero, ""Bonaparte"", abarcaba desde su nacimiento hasta la Coronación en 1804, mientras que el segundo, ""Napoleón"", se ocupaba del resto de su biografía. Después de esta edición se publicó un solo volumen, ""Napoleón Bonaparte"", que no reúne el texto completo de la edición anterior. La editorial Espasa-Calpe publicó en español la edición original en los años sesenta y no ha vuelto a imprimirse desde entonces."
3,English or Spanish,I hope that there is an English version of this book. The version I received was in Spanish.
3,Short life,"I thought the coating on these bits would make them stay sharp longer. It didn't. After using the round edge bit on 20 feet of plywood, the bit was dull. I wish I had bought the Dremel brand bits."
5,Excellent,"A very large microfiber cloth. Excellent for cleaning LCD screens, glasses or anything precious. I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to be liberated from tiny microfiber cloth."
5,"Get The Larger One, You Will Be Glad You Did","I almost ordered the smaller version,Adorama Microfiber Deluxe Cleaning Cloth, Small, 7.5"" x 10"". But at the last minute, I changed my mind and ordered this larger version. Very glad with this purchase, microdear lives up to all the other reviews. It is very thick and durable, no obnoxious case is attached, and it can actually clean camera lenses. The one I received was pink, not green. No problem for me, just a question of color consistency. If you too are thinking of getting the smaller one, stop! This larger one can clean much more and is great with a variety of cleaners. I am using the1 oz. Formula MC Lens Cleaner, a great combination."
5,Best lens cloth I have used,"I started to use Microdear cloth for my camera lens after reading the review from Popular Photography a couple of years ago. It is thick, soft and dustless. It cleans the lens very well without scratching the lens. You do need to wash it once a while to keep it clean."
4,good,Good story and you can almost beleive it was true but it is only a very good story and it makes your own life not so bad
4,Amazing Stuff,"Really great pop stuff, in the truest sense of the word. Loved all the tracks, really loved ""Kay"" and ""Sugary"". Fans of super melodic stuff should run and pick this one up, they don't make 'em like this any more. Short, catchy 3 min tunes that bring to mind a modern version of AM radio's hayday. Fans of Fountains of Wayne and They Might Be Giants should give this a spin."
3,Tired of Jesus and the Mary Chain?,"I really wanted to say someting positive about this EP, as it is the first I have heard from one of the founding members of Jesus and The Mary Chain in over 10 years, but I must confess that I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. Actually, it was recorded back in 1997. Clearly there are a few moments of William's genius, but mainly it sounds like he's just rehearsing alone with his guitar. The other instruments were probably overdubbed afterwards. Lucibelle comes closest to the JMC sound and could be an early outtake. The rest of the EP is a bit of an uninspired effort. Only for completists."
5,One of Aussie's Best,"For those who don't know, Beccy is one of Australia's 'A' List, modern country artists. Beccy is buxom and brash in person but she also has a softer more serious side (most recently shown with her song ""Poster Girl""). Both attitudes shine on these albums.I would probably compare her to 'Martina McBride' with a bit of 'Gretchen Wilson' thrown in.You won't find any 'Patsy [Whine] Cline' here, Beccy's voice is full and rich, has an undoubtedly Aussie inflection and is a pleasure to listen to. Lyrically, she ranges from sweet to down right cheeky. Songs about life that almost everyone can relate to. Highlights for me were, 'Sorry I Asked', 'Little Victories', 'Too Strong To Break' and 'Wild At Heart.If you are a fan of modern country and you are looking for something a little different from the American artists then you couldn't go wrong with this."
5,Wonderful Horse Book!,"If you love horses, or the Paso Fino especially you'll love this book! It's the story of a boy who falls in love with a very special Paso stallion named Danza. He and Danza become, oh, I'm not going to spoil it for you, read this book!"
4,transactions costs and property rights,"I'm using Barzel's book , along with a number of other books and professional journal articles, to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the current back-door privatization of a massiv e portion of New Zealand's South Isalnd High Country. I suspect only economists with a strong interest in property rights theory analyzed from the perspective of modern institutional economics will like this book. It's not for the average reader who isn't willing to do some hard slogging to understand key theoretical ideas. But there are few who can match Barzel's understanding of the development of ""enforcement"" or ""governance"" institutions that both facilitate - and limit - the potential gains for specialization and exchange that neoclassical economics takes for granted.Dr John FountainSenior lecturer in economicsUniversity of Cantebrury, New Zealand"
2,Looks cool...,"Nice looking knife, well machined parts. Now the bad. Knife is WAY too stiff to even think about one-handing it. It's too stiff period. Apparently, Gerber used the permanent type of Locktite on the axis screw, because it stripped before loosening. Also, the frame lock barely overlaps the blade in the open position, making my digits very nervous. It's all academic though, since this blade will occupy my junk drawer until needed for a nasty job. I'm glad the other reviewers had better luck..."
2,Not what I was expecting,The pic showed a nice shiny color but it came as a dull gray color. It looked plastic. I didn't open the package so I can't say how it feels but I don't know. I was expecting something better despite the price due to all the good reviews.
5,Good pocket knife,I got this knife for my friend for his birthday. At first i was sceptical he collects knives and last time i got him one he didn't like it. this time he was excited. he carrys it everywhere. Gerber has a good product line and this knife proved they even put craftsmanship in lower priced goods.
5,UNBELIEVABLE ENDURANCE OF THESE MEN!,KIND OF IRONIC THE NAME OF THE SHIP WOULD BECOME THEIR ULTIMATE MOTO OF SURVIVAL IN THIS DOCUMENTARY. ONE OF THE VERY BEST DOCUMENTARY'S THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN! I SURE DID APPRECIATE MY LIFE AFTER WATCHING THIS. WHO DID THE MUSIC IN THIS? IT WAS SOME VERY RIVETING GUT WRENCHING MUSIC THAT MADE ME SHIVER WHEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE. I HAVE NEVER LOOKED AT LIFE THE SAME AFTER WATCHING THIS. WE THINK WE HAVE PROBLEMS............NOT!
5,Emotional!,I love documentaries of real life situations and this has to be one of the best I've seen. I could'nt take my eye's off this dvd until It was finished. I'ts not really just one story (their ship getting caught in the ice) but about numerous hardships and stories within stories. And best of all it really happened! Also Liam Neeson did a great job narrating.
4,Fantastic True Story on human will,"The story of Shakelton's antarctic expedition is a fantastic look at human nature and what can be accomplished with strong teamwork and leadership. In a nutshell, a bad situation turned worse and a expedition to cross the antarctic turns into a battle for survival.This version of the Shakelton Story starts out a little slow, but is well organized and keeps your interest. The fight for survival is thrilling and just gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. For those interested in human psychology, sociology, and human interaction this would be for you. I consider it a must watch.The one thing I wish it had more of was information on what the crew did on elephant island. A PBS documentary was stronger in that regard over ""The Endurance"".I highly recommend."
5,"Excellent, but $55 for the video/$17 for DVD?",Outstanding movie/outrageous price for a VHS version of a movie available for $17 as a DVD. This has rip-off written all over it!!
5,A Story that deserves to be told and to be heard,"Oh! the age of discovery. Where did it go to? What happened to men of long ago who were adventurers. The Endurance is the name of Earnest Shackleton's vessel. As it turned out, the name would be proven true to significant proportions. This story will teach about the determination of the human spirit. In order for this to be so, it starts with a collection of persons who were extremely skilled in all facets of sea travel. Including the initial construction of seaworthy boats, navigating course direction in adverse conditions, and maintaining a hierarchy of organizational structure. By doing so a platform was put in to place to acheive great things. This story is about acheiving great things.I like the way the dvd is done documetary style. For most of us, this will be the first time we have encountered this compelling story. It is fitting that as we do we see the actual faces of the persons behind it.The story deserves to be told and to be heard."
5,"review of ""the endureance""","i caught a portion of this documentary while at a friend's house, and i just HAD to buy it and watch the whole thing. far and away, one of the best documentaries i have ever seen! the fact that it covers one of the greatest survival stories ever doesn't hurt either. original expedition photos, modern HD video shot on site, excellent voice-over from liam neeson, a plethora of extra features . . . . what more could one ask for? shakleton was a MAN in every sense of the word."
1,Shackleto's DVD,"DVD was damaged, and could not be viewed. It got stuck a few times, until I gave up. I still need this item, but I did not have the time to deal with returning/replacing it. Maybe you could do something about it. Sorry."
4,"The Endurance, by Liam Neeson","This book was easy to read and offered great insight on Shakleton's experience. It provided great insight, based on notes kept by the crew, on the reason many decisions were made and how they affected Shackleton. A great book on how the mind of a great leader thinks."
4,"Look at it for breakfast, suck it for lunch, eat it for dinner",The best film on this topic. A documentry without the stale aftertaste
5,Just Like going back to Antarctica!,"Antarctica.. one of the things i can say.. ""BEEN THERE DONT THAT"" it was almost like going back, One of the best films on Antarctica.. If you like this, check out 90 South.. The film about Capt Scotts Exp."
5,KUDOS FOR LEONARD B. SCOTT,"Scott, who was there truly captures the essence of what being an Army soldier during the Viet Nam Era was like. I have never read anyone offer a more complete and thorough description of Army Basic Training during those days. Scott also does an excellent job in building his characters by reflecting on their varied backgrounds and then integrating them to produce a suberb book. Excellent and must reading for all Army veterans of the Viet Nam Era."
1,Highly disappointed,"When I received this tape it was not Bobby Vee & the Shirelles. It was a tape of singers I was not too familiar with. In 2007, I saw Bobby Vee in concert along with one of the original Shirelles and really wanted to see a tape of early performances. The vendor did apologize and stated that the ID number showed the name as Bobby Vee and the Shirelles and offered to either take back the tape (I would have to pay return postage) or give me a discount on another tape. I kept the tape because the cost of my time and postage to return wasn't worth the effort. This is the first time I was disappointed with Amazon."
4,It held my attention in a depressing way.,"This author is amazing at verbalizing the feelings of a particularly under-evaluated age group. I found myself drawn to the highly-depressed character of 28-year-old Mayan, who knows she has ""issues"" but cannot get past them. The reader is caught in Mayan's whirlpool of unresolved feelings for both parents while she gives up her very self to do what scares her the most - finding her father. Her obsession with her past is heart-rending but familiar."
1,Very dull,"I enjoyed both ""Anywhere but Here"" and ""A Regular Guy,"" so I looked forward to reading ""The Lost Father,"" which is the sequel to ""Anywhere but Here."" However, I found it boring and irritating. I absolutely could not identify with Mayan and couldn't understand why she was so obsessed. Really silly. Don't waste your time."
1,Is This Supposed to be a Sequel?,"I thought that this was a sequel to Anywhere But Here, but while the story lines parallel, the author (and editor)very annoying changed the characters names, as well as the the main characters hometown. The names are close--Ann August becomes Ann Stevenson, the hometown is changed from Bay City, WI to Racine...but my question is--why???? What was the purpose of it? They are obviously the same characters, and for readers who want to follow the story, it is extremely annoying.But at any rate, changed names or not, this story was far too long. About a third at least could've been clipped, maybe more. And it was just boring. Ann is dull, whiny, obsessed with finding this father of hers. And you wonder, why didn't she start with something simple, like look in the phone book in Los Angeles where he used to live. That's where she ends up finding him. All in all, a waste of time."
1,Boooooring,"Loved A Regular Guy and Anywhere But Here. This one is a complete snoozer. Couldn't get past page 90. I skipped ahead several times looking for some glimmer of hope that the story might get better, but it droned on and on and on an and on...."
5,Emotionally brilliant,"M. Simpson is one of the most intelligent, lyrical and emotionally-profound writers working today. This book is about an obsession that drives a young woman's life, an obsession as powerful and heartbreaking and life-destroying as alcoholism or gambling. Once she opens those yellow pages, she's sunk. While I may have wanted Mayan, at times, to do things differently, she simply could not, and her inability to derail her obsession introduces a suspenseful, dark curiosity: just how far she will go? Simpson tells Mayan's story with an acute eye for detail and such fresh, imagistic, musical prose that there are pleasures on every page. While reading this book, I lived and moved in a different consciousness--not always a safe place, sometimes a frustrating one, but invariably compelling, revelatory, and emotionally resonant."
1,"Buy the book, don't buy the cd's","Just a word of advice, buy the book, not the cd's. I wish I would have bought the book because the author's voice is so annoying that I can't bear to listen to the cd's. In fact if I could have gotten my money back for it, I would have. I thought the problem might be mine, but I let other family members and friends borrow it without telling them my feelings. They both gave the cd's back to me, with the same message ""her way of speaking and her inflections were painful to listen to"". They never finished listening to the cd's either. I'm sure she has a message, but I just can't subject myself to her way of speaking."
5,My favorite old wwf tape;,"I love this tape.I was so happy that The Undertaker interfered and didnt let Diesel beat Bret in an cage match thus Bret winning.That all started back at the 96 Royal Rumble when Taker had Bret beat for the Federation title and Diesel stuck his nose where it didnt belong and interfered in the match costing the Deadman a chance to win the Federation title.So Big Daddy Cool got what was coming to him because of what he did.Anyway the best matches are as follow;Razor Ramon vs the 123 Kid(XPac)in an crybaby matchGoldust vs The Undertaker for the I.C titleShawn Michaels vs Owen Hart(R.I.P)Bret Hart vs ""Big Daddy Cool"" Diesel in an cage match for the WWF title"
5,Rio S10,This is an excellent product to introduce someone to portable MP3 players at half the price of $200 ipod. Easy to use with outstanding sound and clarity.
4,Good fantasy book for children,"Meet the world of Furkens - the race of Elves that has forgotten how to turn invisible. This book is like ""The Hobbit"" for kids. It is well written, imaginative and fun. The book left my child and I wanting to know more. We're eager to read the next book about their adventures."
2,Won't hold onto a station,"The tuner seems to drift too much. Also, there's no way to lock the button, so if you are working out and happen to hit the button, the turn will seek the next station, causing you to have to reset to the lowest frequently and work back up. There's also no manual tune, only seek, so if it doesn't think your desired station is strong enough it will skip it and you have no way to get to it. Buy hey, it was cheap."
1,Junk,This little radio is junk. Not even worth buying if it were in the dollar store. It is NOT stereo and the sound quality is hollow. The tuner does its own thing and does not even stop on strong stations. DO NOT BUY THIS RADIO. JWIN does not even respond to emails. Another example of imported garbage that reaches our shores everyday.
3,"cute, like it, however...","It's cute, like it, however... the spoon is too fragile, breaks easily. Recommend using a metal or wooden spoon when you actualy use it, I have had two spoons break."
2,Too small to be useful.,"This bowl looks really cute, but it holds the equivalent of about one avocado. We love our guacamole and this bowl just isn't practical for serving it because we'd just have to get up every two minutes to refill it. Plus as soon as you remove the lid, it no longer looks like an avocado...it just looks like a green bowl that's way too small!"
4,Guac?,"I might be kinda weird but I love putting food in a container that looks like the food. I have this one and another for salsa that looks like a chili pepper. This one looks nice for serving and the guac can be stored in it for a short time as well. Handle with care, it is porcelain and can chip."
4,Good Offering,"I haven't had time to really peruse it, yet, but it appears it is a nice book with different offerings. It goes from Easy to Experienced. Each is a special offering in design and color. I believe it will be a great addition to my other books and info on Afghans. I purchased it on Amazon."
3,"So, I just don't get it","I've owned several band saws and have always added the Stabilizer. It is well worth the investment. Only drawback I currently have is that I bought a used Jet 12 inch band saw and added the model DEL1. I haven't been able to figure out how to put the blade guard back onto the saw as the bolt that held the guard in place is part of the guide assembly removed and replaced. Installation instructions are pretty generic, but in this case I think additional info is warranted.Update: Per Carter, the blade guard does not fit the Jet 12 inch band saw when the Stabilzer is in place. So, don't sneeze while scroll cutting :-)"
2,Wildly Overrated!,"The fact that as of this writing 20+ copies are available new and used at big discounts might be a warning sign. The big-concept selling point here is that on this album PWR was finally freed to be his highly original self,and played tunes by Ornette Coleman,Coltrane,and Monk (along with his more standard fare). However,on these supposed epochal encounters with the ultra-moderns,he does little more than state the themes as written,with no improvisation at all on two and minimal improvisation on the third. Critics whom I trust praised this highly,and I bought it on their recommendation--my mistake; don't make it!"
3,NEITHER BLUE or HIGH PERFORMANCE,disappointing product. it is neither blue in color and it is not a high performance bulb -- at least that I can see. and nobody has noticed or said a word that my headlights look any different.
2,Dead inside of a year,OK light output. Not blue just a nice white color. One bulb dead just about a year old. Dissapointing. Wont buy again.
2,Duds,"I purchased these bulbes in June 2011. As my lenses are quite cloudy, I didn't pay much attention to how dim they appeared. I don't drive that much, so expected these bulbs to work for a few years. 18 months later, one is already dead and Amazon won't replace it. 12 month warranty only. Boo."
3,Not Blue,"I bought these figuring that they would have that cool blue look. They are white. Not a bad bulb, still bright. But do not mistake these for a blue looking bulb."
3,Wrestling,If you love to watch the old style wrestling as I do then you will enjoy this DVD It is worth the money you pay for it.
4,Kim's best project to date.,Kim has recorded a number of fine and very mellow smooth jazz sax albums that are interesting but sometimes lacklustre. This CD is his best to date and has many good songs and very strong production values.
4,Sax Man at his best,"One of best friends got me hooked on Kim Waters after letting me hear his Someone To Love CD. With his 2001 From The Heart CD release, Kim offered up more of the sensual jazz sounds his fan love. Kim Waters is accompanied by Jazz from Dru Hill on a cover of The Spinner's classic Love Don't Love Nobody which is one of the best songs on the album. Other noteable selections include Until Dawn and Sweet Desire."
1,Unlisted boot review,I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time. The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable. The material is so hard and did not give. I even wore socks and that did not help. I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort.
5,Exceptional Campbell Interviews,"If you were introduced to Campbell by his interviews with Bill Moyers and ""The Power of Myth,"" then these audio cassettes are a very good next step.I like Campbell's work very much: his books, his videos, his lectures, etc. But I think that he shines most when being interviewed - it is in his interviews (be they with Bill Moyers or these) that he shines the most.Michael Toms (the interviewer on these tapes) obviously has a background in myth - hence, he is a little more informed than Bill Moyers was and his relationship with Joseph Campbell is different. ""The Power of Myth"" is a great starting point, but I would say that I may have even taken more from these interviews with Michael Toms than I did those with Moyers.I recommend these tapes highly."
2,"If you're looking for great Campbell stuff, look elsewhere","I love Joseph Campbell, but these tapes are more about the interviewer, Michael Toms. I was really disappointed at the questions he asked and the way the whole thing seemed to be edited together.Look for the tapes of Campbell's lectures instead!"
4,The sad state of America,"Obviously there is no ""conspiracy theory"" being inferred in this excellent rant, that is not the Point!! ""Dudley Do Rights, and Do Gooders"" who operate at tax payer expense, forcibly collected at the end of a gun, who really have never been needed in the course of history, at least not at the extent the system has them operating, is. The focus is on why do We The People allow the outrageous teaching practices and murderous law enforcement to continue? Answer? We love our tv.s and taxes more than real freedom. Democracy is three wolves and a sheep deciding what is for dinner, Liberty (A Constitutional Republic) is a well armed sheep contesting the menu. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"
1,Skip this one,A third-grader could write a better book than this. It's more like a blog rant from Glen Beck than a well-reasoned argument.
3,Very Piano-y But Good,"I'm a big fan of this period film which explored the controversial issue of whether there is any overlap between racism and homophobia. There are some obvious differences: gay men can 'pass'; blacks generally cannot. But the film suggests that the issue is not so simple. Julianne Moore is wonderful as the woman forced to confront both forms of discrimination simultaneously.This is one of Elmer Bernstein's last film scores. He scored many films and I'm not in a position to say how this one ranks in comparison to the others. I must say it is very piano-y, but if you're prepared for that I think you will not be displeased."
2,Bland,"I haven't seen the movie. The music that Mr. Bernstein wrote for it amy work very well in that context. But listening to it as a work unto itself is a somewhat dry and unrewarding experience. The tracks sound more like ""musical doodling"" by a skilled craftsman than anything else. Better representations of Mr. Bernstein at his best would be the soundtracks for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""The Magnificent Seven."""
2,What a disappointment,"What a disappointment to buy this CD in advance of the movie, anticipating a return to the powerful, lush and sweeping scores of Elmer Bernstein of the 50's and 60's. Week themes and bland solo work makes this one a bore. The movie was slightly more powerful in its delivery, but the music does not appreciably add to the emotion of the film. Try finding some of Bernstein's earlier work to relive the magic."
3,A Town in Black and White,"This is about history and a town where the present inhabitants want to make the past live on. They have created a living museum to preserve part of Australia's heritage. The celebration of the gold rush and, therefore, the reason for the town to exist could not be more apparent from the text.Then there are pages of black and white photographs which emphasise the preservation of the town as a living historical document. At a time when there is a world wide interest in finding one's roots, family trees and family history research being the second greatest use to which the Internet is put, this town has ensured it will be remembered.Elsewhere in Australia new seems to be everything and properties of relatively modern vintage are demolished to make way for something more in vogue. Not the case in Maldon, as anyone who obtains this delightful book will be bound to agree."
4,Cute,Not bad. Could have been shorter. Cute idea for a story. But not the best time traveling romance either...probably won't read it again.
2,not as good as her others,"When I got this book, and its sequel, Touch of Enchantment, I was sure I would really love them. I didn't at all. The book just really fell flat. To the reader who said she would not try anything by her, I wanted to say please don't give up on her ! I recommend A Whisper of Roses very highly, I would never give that book up, never!"
1,awful,"I sent for this book after reading the reviews (at Amazon), and found it to be unbelievably awful. The ""hero"" was one-dimensional, and the fantasy was too great of a reach. Ugh! I feel like I wasted my money."
3,More like a breath of boredom,"I actually read the second book of this story, ""Touch of Enchantment"", first and I'm very glad I did. Otherwise, just going by this book I might not have picked up any of her other books. ""Touch"" was the first time I had read any of her books and she has definitely earned herself a new fan. The problem with ""Breath of Magic"" seems to be really getting the engine going. She sets everything up, all the elements are there, but ""something"" just doesn't connect. But don't be discouraged, there are some cute moments and you should read this if nothing else just to set the history for ""Touch"". But I do enjoy her writing and so will be scouring the shelves for more of her work."
3,You have got to be kidding!,"Although I found the story idea interesting , the characters were extremely flat (no substance, what-so-ever). You never feel anything for anybody in the novel....alright, maybe a very mild irriation at Sven for being the typical brawns-without-a-brain character. The humor at most made me smile but never truly touched any chord. I gave this novel three stars because it was a good attempt at....well...something. Hopefully Ms. Medeiros's other novels will be more interesting."
3,Works great but......,The blower motor and fan work great. I had to modify the mounting bracket because the holes were slightly off from the factory bracket. It was a pain in the butt since at first glance they look the same. After about 1 1/2 hrs of trial and error I finally figured out the problem. What should have been a 10 min. job took almost 2 hrs. OEM my a#$.
5,"Good price, correct part.","Plug and play, good quality and better price than some of the cheaper aftermarket options. Has been working well since install."
5,Awesome,It works great. It's in an annoying location so install was a pain on my vehicle. I would recommend this brand.
5,A life changer,"This book changed my life. I can now ""see"". As a begining art student, I was having difficulty ""seeing"". I read this book 3 times in a row when I first got it. It changed the way I look at everything. People, places, life. Such a passion for life, drawing and humanity comes through Frederick Franck's drawings and words. Frederick Franck is an amazing conduit. I'm grateful he wrote this book. Highly, highly recommended."
2,An interesting collection of thoughts.,"If you are looking for a book about Zen, then Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind is a better bet.If you are looking for a book about drawing, then Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a better bet.This book is a collection of thoughts on Zen, meditation, and drawing. It is an interesting juxtaposition of several drawings and a description of the processes (physical, mental, and spiritual) that lead to such drawings. It is a diary, not an instruction manual."
5,N. Pourpourakis,"I met Nick Pourpourakis, the composer of the last song on this CD, ""The Sultan"", 15 years ago. In his heyday he was one of the most talented and most popular of Greek Musicians here in the United States. His speciality is ""Rembetiko"" style music which is the theme of this CD. He is still active and performs in a local restaurant in Sherman Oaks, California and was recently on television. He composed ""The Sultan"" in New York in the 50's in his late teens and he has actually worked with some of the musicians who are featured on the album (who of course were quite a bit older). ""The Sultan"" was also chosen as background music for an episode of a very popular Soap Opera in Greece ""Lampsi."" This CD ""MOURMOURIKA"" is an excellent collection of a style of music that was in a world of its own, back in the 1900's to about the late 1950's. I recommend it highly, especially to music historians. Here's to you Nick."
4,Parallels works great for me,I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it works as advertised. I have XP running easily and it saves my last session everytime. I haven't given it 5 stars because I'd like it to work with windows-based games (like MMO's) seamlessly and it doesn't...yet.
5,Worth It,"I am a new owner of a Mac but was still unsure about stepping away from the PC. The Parallels program eased that transition. Now I have the best of both worlds. I have Windows for all my work applications and the Mac for my movie and photo editing programs. If you are like me, and afraid of taking the leap into the Apple world then Parallels will help with your PC fix."
2,Your worst nightmare!,"Hard to get going intially, all upgrades have caused the program to crash. Most recent crash led to massive data loss. Support section available at company website but they don't respond to email requests. No phone number provided--you must pay them via credit and then they claim they will call you back--they never called me back! They just took my money! Apple considers this third party software & therefore they do not support it. Keep in mind the following summary: hard to install, upgrades crash the program, risk of massive data loss, no email support, no telephone support. This is your worst nightmare; caveat emptor (buyer beware)!!"
2,XP aborts,"I had parallels working just fine for about two weeks, running Windows XP.It was great.Around November 11, I received an update to parallels which may or may not have installed (who knows?).Subsequently when I tried to run my VM, windows XP attempts ot boot up and then immediately stops.Even in safe mode, it aborts, and returns to the VM.As others have experienced the ""support"" provided by parallels is a one-way street. My email went unanswered.This is a great idea missing something in the execution."
2,Parallels Program,This is a very powerful program backed by one of the weakest technical support crews in the world. Their offices are constantly closed and the FAQ online is rivaled only by Apple's lack of actual help topics. Don't be in a hurry to use this product and you will find that it does work very well. You will not be up and running in minutes. Plus you must go buy Microsoft XP or Vista to run on this. It would be nice if they were packaged together or at the very least disclosed on the product itself before purchase.
1,Too many bugs and glitches,"Installation went OK on my new iMac 2.8 Core2 Duo. Basic functions looked working fine. Internet connection had no problem. However, as soon as you try to do something more sophisticated, it doesn't work at all. Often times it hangs without any obvious reason and only way to get out of the status is reboot. Seamless mode never worked as advertised. No customer support. Forget about drag and drop between Mac and Windows - it will crash. It cannot detect external hard drive that is connected via USB. It cannot even handle Windows automatic update. Can't believe I paid $79 for this piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Their version should be 0.1.7 or something. Not even close to 1.0."
3,Clarification on Parallels 3.0/Leopard/XP Home OEM version,"Only one review has said that one must have a full retail, not new OEM, version of Windows XP to work with Parallels. Of course, I have just bought 2 copies of OEM XP, one for me and one for my daughter, whose Macbook has 1G ram (my MBP has 2G).Could someone please confirm whether I'm sunk before I start - I think I can at least use it for Bootcamp....Many thanks!"
4,Everything should run this smoothly!,"Parallels installs quickly and easily. For the XP installation, I followed the booklet step-by-step, since it's not as intuitive as the usual Mac install. It is, however, easier than installing XP on a PC.XP runs inside a separate window, which you can use full-screen if you prefer. The 5 or 6 applications I need that are PC only have installed and worked without a hitch. I was even able to set up a network print server (Buffalo Technologies) via WIndows, then got it to work on the Mac. Tivo fans, it will run the Tivo Desktop, too.Overall, I'm thrilled with this fast, smooth virtual machine."
5,"Great Product, perfect solution","I recently purchased an iMac 24"" with 4GB RAM to replace my Windows home computer. However, there were three programs I use regularly that had no MAC equivalent: Quicken 2009 Premium, Wordsearch 8, and Legacy 7. I installed Parallels, a new (full) copy of Windows XP, got all the updates, and installed the aforementioned three programs as well as Norton AV 2009, Word, Excel, and Outlook. Parallels works flawlessly. In three weeks of use, I have never had a problem. I can save files to a USB hard drive connected to my Mac and print from a network printer connected to my Time Capsule backup storage device. I highly, highly recommend this program."
1,Parallels 3.0 not so hot,"Parallels installed without difficulty on my iMac Leopard, but after that, the trouble began. Peripherals and downloads proved difficult, if not impossible. I was so turned off, I uninstalled it and went back to Boot Camp. My Windows xp works fine now, and so does my Leopard."
1,Terrible - ton of problems and bugs - Appalling customer support,"I have had nothing but problems with Parallels, both in version 2 and version 3. Always crashing, slow, problems with USB ports.The customer support is appalling. The application cost $59.00 and if you want to speak to tech support (even within 30 days of purchase) they charge you $29.00. Their free tech support is via email which they will get back to you within 3 DAYS. Once they get back and their solution does not work (which is usually the case) you have to email them back again and wait.Other colleagues using Parallels have had major problems with Parallels as well. Perhaps if it worked and you did not have to constantly seek tech support it wouldn't be that bad.DO NOT BUY!"
2,not happy,The product was installed by a professional computer store and has been working intermittently since. Half the time it won't start which is very annoying. I am considering replacing it with Fusion.
3,The previous version was more stable,"From my good experience with a previous version of Parallels, I decided to upgrade to 3.0. It seems like it was released a little too early as it is crashing at least once a day. Parallels is good and should be nicer once this current version stabilized, but I just can't get my work done with this product in it's current state.Instead of reverting to the previous version of Parallels, I decided to try a competing product by downloading the 30 day trial of VMWare Fusion. It has the stability that I need to get my work done. It can also utilize multiple processors/cores and supports x64 guest OSes. With Fusion, the virtual machine seems to be a bit faster than the one I had running in Parallels, probably because of the multiprocessor feature. The x64 feature is also a serious plus for me as I need to test/troubleshoot software under x64 Windows.Parallels is nice, when it is working, but VMWare Fusion is really nice and gets my recommendation.VMware Fusion Mac"
2,"works, kinda","Does work but installation is a nightmare ! No, repeat no, support so you are on your own. What they do pass as support is just an email of code text only a geek would appreciate. Never have been able to figure out web access from the Windows side. Hopefully something better and more user friendly will be available soon."
1,Easily the worst software I have ever bought in my entire life,"All I need is a simple virtualization software for my Mac Core 2 Duo. I used to use Parallels before I got a new computer.Now it no longer works, it just gives me a gray screen of death. Customer service is an absolute nightmare. No one ever responds to my requests. ""Ivan"" wanted my build # and screenshots. I tried explaining to Ivan that I can't take a screenshot when my screen freezes.moreover, EVERYONE is having this same problem, and rather than fixing it or coming out with a public statement about it, they just act like it's not a problem and deny people service.It is not my life's sole purpose to prevent anyone from ever purchasing parallels desktop for mac. I'm making the switch to VMWare Fusion now."
4,Great when it works,"Easy installation and it runs better than my old Windows machine. However, I have a brand new Mac and it is quriky about opening, sometimes refusing for several tries. Overall, it makes the Windows on Mac experience just great."
4,Parallels Works,"I am a dentist and I have this running my office managment softward on my Mac and it works great. It took some effort to install the Practice Management into Parallels-as a Mac user, I didn't realize how difficult it is to get set up on a Windows network. I had to get our IT guy to come in and take care of that. However, now that he has, it runs great. Just as I hoped."
4,Two operating system in one,"I really like to be able to run some Windows programs in my Mac. The only con I find is that sometimes it falls, so you have to force quit Parallels. I hope they solve this soon."
1,Product 5 Stars Help 0 Stars.,THis is a good product and it works as advertised. However you are on your own if you need help. Support is non existent. I had a question and needed some help with the initial install. Two weeks later I received an email saying my help request had been assigned a support number and to use that number in all future correspondence for assistance.
1,NON-EXISTENT TECHNICAL SUPPORT,"Unless you're particularly computer saavy, you may be a lot better off using boot camp.There is virtually NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT.If you have any problems with this program, and I've had several, you're basically on your own.I bought this program to be able to run some 3rd party software on my new mac pro. When I had trouble with one of the programs, I contacted technical support by e-mail. They responded a week later. (They claim to respond within 3 days). They told me that parallels doesn't work with that particular program.I contacted them again about a problem I had with running a webcam with windows and they advised me to upgrade to a newer version of parallels. Once I did that, I've lost all ability to access the internet with windows through parallels. I've contacted them twice to resolve this problem and still no response....a week later!!"
5,"5-star from website, 1-star from disk","I bought the disk with my Mac, but the disk was out-of-date for Leopard, and wouldn't run. So I went to the Parallels website & downloaded the trial version which worked perfectly. Then I went ahead & paid for it again bc Mac said it was a Parallels problem & Parallels charges $30 to talk to them on the phone. Anyhow, for all you Vista/MS haters, trash your PC and enjoy the quality of Mac with Windows XP too! (XP runs better on my Mac than it did on my PC)."
4,NIce but limited support,"Some USB devices don't work. Also, games that require CD-ROM to be inserted all the times, Parallels fails to read it."
1,no support,"I bought this from Amazon not realizing that Parallels Desktop 3.0 was an old version. I wanted to run DOS 6.0 on my macbook but could not install it from floppy disks and could not get advice on how to achieve the installation with CD-ROMs or floppies. No response from the company. Now I have to buy a complete version of Windows XP, install it and run DOS under the command prompt. I could have done this without Parallels. It was a total waste of money for me."
1,Parallels Constantly Crashes my MAC/NO tech support for their product,"I've had Parallels 3.0 for about a year now. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.Not only does running my Win XP virtual machine constantly crash my MacBook Pro (I have to do a hard reboot), but I also frequently get out of virtual memory Monitor PE error messages. I have 4GB of RAM!!!! I have to reboot my MacBook and restart Parallels to get it going again. I emailed Parallels' tech support when I first got the product and NEVER heard back from them. Finally, various manufacturers' drivers CD auto installers will not run in Parallels. I had to manually load printer drivers, etc.I got so sick and tired of Paralles crashing that I finally tried VMWare Fusion 2 for the past couple of weeks and so far, so good. I've been able to use CDs' auto installers, and so far, I've had no errors - that's after loading 3 VMs (XP, server 2008, and Ubuntu)."
2,Far inferior to VMWare Fusion,"I have used all types of virtualization products for a long time now, and was very disappointed by this product. I was continuously getting BSODs with 98 and 2000 under Parallels. At that time I switched to the beta of Fusion and had no stability issues after that.One terrific thing about Parallels though is that, even though I bought the product through Amazon and was at the 30 day mark, the company cheerfully and promptly refunded my money, honoring their guarantee. Bravo!"
4,Great performance!,Have been very please with the VM performance of Parallels on my MacBook Pro. Run Windows 2000 and Fedora Linux in VMs. Truly the best of all worlds.
4,For Mac Lovers when you need Windows,"I am a Mac lover but I had no choice but to get a program that is only Windows compatible. The solution is Parallels. The installation is simple and when I entered the WinXP disc the installation was easy. I can start Windows while working in OSX, no need for rebooting and I can shift from on to another easily. If however you are a gamer (and some games are only Windows or Vista) then I am not sure that Parallels is the best idea. It is a great product and I recommend it."
4,If you must use Windows ...,"Every once in while, there is just no choice for dedicated MAC users but to use some antiquated ""windows only"" app. When that happens, Parallels Desktop is an excellent solution on any Intel MAC. The desktop loads easily and makes loading Windows a snap. Running Windows Vista as a window in OSX works great. (Of course all of the quirkiness of Windows is still there.) The desktop does not require dedicated hard drive space, it starts and shut down quickly and switching between OSX and WIN is a snap - which means you can easily limit WIN to only those times its really necessary. The only glitch that I found is that the internet connection must be ""connected"" each time WIN starts up, which probably protects WIN from infestation when not in use - its just a pain to remember to connect it every time. Overall, this is a good product that works as advertised."
2,Parallels is a necessary evil,Too slow if you're doing anything of consequence. You're better off buying a cheap PC.
5,Great virtualization software for Mac,"I have been using parallels on a mac mini with windows 2000 for about two weeks. When the mac mini had only 512MB of ram, parallels slowed down the mini so that it could not really run very well. Only Parallels could run under that circumstance. But when I got maxed out the Mini to 2 GB of Ram, well, it stops at nothing and even Parallels cannot slow it down. In fact, parallels runs windows and its programs very well and very fast. It is easy to set up, run and connect peripherals to.This is a great program for those of us who still want/need to run a few older windows programs. I use it to run some Logos/Libronix bible/theological software which is not written for Macs. Do not want to lose my investment or the ability to use and search these volumes. Logos promises that they are working on writing for a Mac, but it seems to be taking forever.In any case, GREAT program. Easy to use and fast."
3,This is NOT the latest version!!! Don't Buy Here!,"Amazon has a little graphic next to the product that says this is the ""latest version."" It is NOT 3.0. They are dumping inventory on the 2.0 version. Yes, you can upgrade by faxing in your receipt and waiting for an email so you can download the new version... If I wanted to do that, I would have purchased an online download directly. Very maddening."
4,Parallels Desktop for Intel MacOS X,"After using Virtual PC for years, my first thought is FAST, freaky fast! In a 2.0GHz Core Duo iMac, it is easily the fastest Windows system I've ever used. Windows XP reboots in less than 10 seconds. I also installed NetBSD, FreeBSD, and Fedora Core linux. All work very well.The only downside is that the Parallels features and interface is not quite as mature as VPC was. But recent updates are improving it and there's nothing like FAST."
2,Not too thrilled!,Parallels has been a bit disappointing for me. I installed it on a brand new mac powerbook and it has been very buggy and slow. Nothing I have tried has seemed to improve the performance.
1,Does Not Work As Advertised,"With new iMac, we bought Parallels and XP software. It would install, but would not either not run or not load older Windows programs. This are primarily older 2 dimensional games, regardless of how simple they are. Furthermore buyer should be aware that technical support is virtually non existent. Many attempts to email or contact them were never answered."
2,This product is flaky,I'm really disappointed by the quality of this product on my Macbook Pro. It does not run well on Leopard (actually it sometimes does NOT run at all) and seems to be quite buggy.My experience with VMWare (on much slower hardware) was much better than Parallels but to be fair I've never used VMWare on Macs.The support is also not all that good.
1,Does not work with new Mac OS,Good product but does not work with the latest MAC OS so don't waste your time and money.The new versions STINK!
5,Amazing,"I now do all my work on Mac, and no longer need Parallels, but when I used it, it was WONDERFUL! It's like having two computers running on the same screen! Really user friendly, really convenient..."
4,Gives me the Windows Access I need,"I don't do anything complicated, but I need Windows access on my Intel Mac so I bought this when I upgraded to Leopard. I'd had the prior version. Works fine - and I've found that their support forums are pretty good AND are monitored by the vendor's technical staff, which is a practice more companies should adopt."
3,Better than Bootcamp,"This product offers a better Windows in Mac experience than bootcamp does. I did have some trouble getting it setup properly though.1) It blue-screened during installation every time until I finally resorted to writing the Windows Vista disk to my hard-drive as an ISO.2) I upgraded the RAM after installation and it wouldn't boot Vista anymore until I reinstalled Windows.3) Even after doing that, Windows sometimes blue-screens. This is likely due to bugs in the drivers for the fake devices that Parallels uses because it never crashed when I ran Windows in Bootcamp on the same machine.All in all though, I like this setup because I can use Windows in Mac without rebooting."
3,slow!,"parallels desktop itself works fine, but it makes my Mac system so slow. If I want to use the Mac applications and have to click places besides the parallels desktop window, the ""loading sign"" of the mouse appears and I have to wait for few minutes. when it gets really slow, I have to wait for like 10-30 min. So I only use one system at a time. Either the Windows (parallels desktop) or the Mac. I wish the transition was faster. isn't parallels desktop for using both systems together, switching back and forth conveniently? Better than nothing though... I tried the Virtual PC but it didn't work at all on my laptop so I had no choice.anyway, if you are buying any of those virtual machine programs,DON'T FORGET TO BUY THE WINDOWS INSTALLATION CD since it doesn't come with the packet.you will need it for the license."
1,"Non existent tech support, unstable software, save your data in a shared file","This product is dangerous because it seems to work fine and gain your trust, then bam... complete shutdown. I don't know whether Microsoft or Parallels is to blame but I was running Outlook which crashed the XP I was running in Parallels and then when I restarted, an XP prompt said a system 32 file was missing.So now any data that was in there is trapped and gone forever. If you use this definitley keep your data, like working docs or your Outlook pst database in the shared files on the mac side. I assume that any data tat is in the virtual machine cannot be recovered if it crashes.I don't know that for sure because after pating $30 for ""Priority Tech Support"" on a Friday afternoon and it's now Tuesday next week and I cannot get through or have any of messages returned.Wait until they stabilize this product and get thier tech support team up to a reasonable response level."
2,Sort of works,"I installed Parallels Desktop as best I could considering the instructions given with the product were not accurate. I sent a question to customer service by EMail and did not get a response. So far I can run windows XP but can not connect to internet when in windows mode. Since I can not connect to the interent from windows I am unable to validate my copy of windows and it will probably stop running soon. Probably good for a real techie but if your average or slightly above average in your knowledge, don't bother."
1,A DISASTER,"This ""software"" is extremely slow, even on a new iMac with 4GB of RAM. Trying to turn it off causes the ""pinwheel of death"" to spin until the system is rebooted. The interface is unbelievably clumsy, and the documentation is a joke. I would give this product zero stars if I could. Stick with Bootcamp or else try a vastly superior product, VMWare Fusion."
1,Where's the tech support?,"I followed all of the instructions in the Quick Start guide to the letter. Generally I got the same response from my MacBook Pro that they showed in the guide. Then, I got to a point where it just stopped doing anything. I took the same steps as the first time making sure that I hadn't screwed something up. Low and behold, the same problem arose. I went to the publisher's website, registered, and sent an email to tech support about my issue. The response I got back was something to the effect of ""we value your feedback"" not ""we'll get back within 24 hours."" Of course, I've never heard ""boo"" from tech support dudes at Nova in several days. I'm stuck with software that won't install (but can be returned) and the one thing I never wanted to own (and cannot be returned)--my own personal copy of Windows XP. Steer clear of this program."
1,If only I could get it to work....,"Hard to review since I've never been able to get it to load properly. Waste of my money.Maybe if you're an Apple tech this will work for you, but speaking as someone who's had a computer since my first Apple II in '79, this is NOT a good solution if you aren't super apple-savvy. I'm going back to an XP machine because this just won't load on my mac so I can be productive."
1,Parallels Desktop for Apple,"I find this product very difficult to use. The instructions are poorly written and hard to follow. I would not recommend purchasing an Apple if you need to run any windows programs or hardware...printers, scanners, external hard drives, etc.Kenneth Watson"
1,Warning! Does not work on Mac Pro w/o some workarounds,"I was all excited about this program until I tried to load the shareware program. Apparently, this software is not usable on MacPro yet. No where did I find that written until trying to download the shareware program and running into problems which led me to do a search for fixes. Found some information after a search on a meta search engine that sent me to http://forum.parallels.com/ , which BTW is not under Support on the Parallels website. AAHHHH! The aggravation! It may work great on other machines but not on the Mac Pro. So far I've been able to configure a virtual machine but everytime I go to ""power"" it I get an error message - no communication with hypervisor. Currently trying the workaround mentioned in the forum. Jury is still out on that."
3,Didn't know I would have to purchase Windows too!,"When I purchased Parallels I was not aware that you needed a full purchase of Windows also. All I have is what came with my computer, therefore, I cannot use Paralles! I haven't even taken it out of the box. After the purchase of an Apple, warranty, Parallels, I'm broke. Plus, I would have never purchased knowing what I know now. Expensive just to run Windows on a Mac. The reason I went to a Mac is its better. I'm not putting the product down, from what I hear and read its great."
2,This is still in Beta,"They have no business using you as their venture capitalist and making you pay to be a beta tester. It's chocky full of bugs. i.e. You can't use a USB printer in Windows XP., many more known bugs"
2,"Great concept, but too buggy for regular use.","This program is the reason I bought my Mac. I was thinking it would make the transition from my PC software painless. When it works, it works great. In theory, the Mac & PC are integrated almost seamlessly. The problem is that the installation keeps breaking. Parallels makes my late model Leopard based iMac just as buggy as my PC. It's capable of freezing up the Mac and forcing me to do a power-off to get the thing to reset. It also does not integrate well with my USB printer. After using it for two months I've finally given up on it and purchased the Mac versions of all my must have software."
4,Parallels on my Mac mini,"Overall I am quite happy with this product. It installed easily with no fuss what so ever. I am using this with Windows Vista Business edition. It is somewhat slow to boot, but is probably due to the amount of memory I have in my Mini which is 1 gb. If you use the Windows side of this more frequently than OS X, just let it ""sleep"" in this mode. I have found that not all Windows software will load with this package. Ulead Movie Factory 6, and Audio Magix would not work. All the usual Microsoft suspects such as Office, Money, Visio, Project etc, run fine. I can't seem to utilize some of the Mac's built-in features such as the bluetooth, or firewire port, but maybe they will be fine in time. A worthwhile product for the money!"
4,good product,"It works really well. Just know you need a valid copy of windows OS to install, that has not been used before, or you have to buy another windows license for the OS to use it on the MAC"
4,"Love Parallels, more glitches with upgrade/Leopard","I love Parallels. It allows me to separate my work life (Windows) and personal life (Mac), while maintaining easy access to both on the same computer. I recently upgraded my mac OS to Leopard, which is why I upgraded to Parallels 3.0. I did not experience a single problem running OSX Tiger with the older version of Parallels, but the virtual machine has frozen up on me a couple of times using the new versions. I imagine that both Leopard and Parallels will be upgraded shortly to fix these operating glitches.Other than that, I can not imagine life before Parallels. It was easy to install. The new snapshot feature has worked seamlessly, although an IT person told me that I should copy any important files on the virtual machine onto the mac side or onto an external drive. I highly recommend this product."
2,Guest OS's are limited...,"I was very impressed with the ease of installation of Parallels. I easily had Fedora and Vista RC1 going quickly. No problems on the Macbook (2GHz / 2GB RAM).However, Parallels only allows for light use of the guest operating system. In other words, works great for internet browsing. I expected to be able to drag files from one desktop to the other in which Parallels doesn't support. You have to transfer through the virtual network Parallels sets up between Mac OSX and the guest operating system. Even 2GB of RAM and 768MB of RAM for Vista wasn't enough for Vista to play an mp3 or movie.I would expect this program to be more valuable to a programmer than an everyday user. I expected to be able to work with some of the media programs available to Windows users (movie editing, music, dvd rippers, whatever), but found that none of this would be possible.Give the trial some good time before purchasing Parallels."
4,Good Product but damaged,"I looked forward to receiving this software for installation on my new Apple computer, howver it would'nt install sucessfully. I took it to the Apple store who found the CD to be scratched and replaced it free of charge. I did not return to Amazon because the software package had been opened. I am now sucessfully using the program but not due to Amazon"
5,The only solution for tight Mac/Windows integration,"I ordered Parallels after first using VMWare Fusion. While Fusion was stable for me on an Intel iMac 2.4GHz, it didn't feel like there was really well thought-out integration between the two OS's.After installing and using Parallels, I would not recommend the current version of Fusion to anyone who needs seamless access to both Windows & Mac programs in real-time. The single most compelling feature of Parallels (that Fusion lacks) is called SmartSelect. It allows you to assign either a Windows or Mac program to any file type. So, if you use Apple Mail and receive a .exe file, it will open in Windows. If you use Outlook Express and receive a .pdf file, you can have it open in Preview (on the Mac side).What Parallels claims is true... you really can use the best program for the job, regardless if it's Mac or Windows. SmartSelect makes this possible."
2,Crashed with not support.,"After 6 weeks of infrequent use the system crashed, I tried to reinstall several times with no success. The was no support available to assist. I have given up. When it worked, it did not function fully as a Windows software should. I am very disappointed and would not recommend it."
3,Version 3.0 to be released soon,Bought my copy of Parallels Desktop for Mac 13 days before the May 1 deadline. No free upgrade for me (to version 3 -- coming June 2007). Version 3 has lots of great new features. 3D Graphics. and Coherence being real improvements. Wait. It's a hassle to install it.. wait for the new one
4,Parallels for Mac,"This is a GREAT program for your Mac if you need to run lots of PC software on your computer. Once Windows is installed, it is super easy to navigate. Parallels itself is so easy to install, a monkey with two fingers could do it. I did, however, have some trouble getting Windows onto my computer...I finally had to take it to work and have one of the IT guys do it (it took him the entire morning). That's the only reason this product didn't get 5 stars."
4,"Fast, fantastic software",Enables you to run windows on your mac. All the software that I've tried has worked. It runs FAST on my Macbook Pro 2.4 Core 2 Duo. SO much better than Virtual PC.
1,Stay away,This is a disaster....get fusion instead. I have had nothing but difficulties getting it to load and function.
4,Does what it says and makes it easy,I was going back and forth over whether to buy Parallels or VM Fusion and just tried the free download. The product worked so well I didn't even bother with a comparison test when the free demo expired; I just bought it.
5,Pure beauty.,"If you've ever been in love, the songs on this Cd will rip your heart out. Perhaps one of the most beautiful Cd's I've ever heard. The arrangements are lush andMarvin Gaye's voice along with his emotional treatment of the standards, Why Did I Choose You and the Shadow of Your Smile are works of art that will bring you to tears. There was only one Marvin Gaye and this CD makes you painfully aware of how much the world lost with his passing."
5,i got this for fathers day last year,i got this for fathers day last year and it is a gem.this man had so many styles that it would take 9 lives to understand his depth.his voice fits the material like a glove.i hear what goes for light jazz or easy listening and what would you call the arrangements and textures of this album? records like this show you what's missing today in music.most artist today can't even do a half a style less more dream of what Marvin Gaye achieves here.
5,Marvelous Marvin,"I have this CD for about 5 years and everytime/anytime i listen to the songs Marvin's music hits me so deep inside. No other artists work have touched me the way Marvin's music has. This CD is up there, in my opinion, with Whats going on and Lets get it on.Classic times 100"
4,"Fine sequel to ""Juggling the Stars""","Tim Parks continues the sordid, yet comic, misadventures of Morris Duckworth. The sequel didn't grab me into it as much as the first, but still was a very enjoyable read. Dig in to this series and enjoy."
3,Up to your navel in bodies,"Morris Duckworth left England and now lives in Italy where his name does not sound so awful. As the book begins, he has murdered three people. As the book ends, he has killed three more and is aching for a fourth. His steering committee is ghostly Mimi, victim number three, who directs him via a cellular phone or from the picture of the Virgin. Clearly, Morris is off his rocker. The author finds this very funny. I don't.Will the cops ever catch up with Morris? I won't tell, because it would take the last bit of fun out of it."
3,Hmm,"Lemme tell you, I LOVED Distorted Lullabies, Ours' first album. Jimmy Gnecco's voice was so awesome, and the lyrics were dark. I dunno, but I am very dissappointed in this album. Jimmy's voice doesn't seem as good as it did before. The songs are okay, and I'm sure I'll listen to the album, and enjoy it, but I think Ours' took a step backward with this album."
5,Shattering glass,"This album has been in my collection for awhile and rightfully so. This man has an incredible voice. Even if its not your cup of tea, you gotta give the man his dues. Very good songwriter also."
3,"jimmy ""jeff buckley"" gnecco","It's nice someone is copying the late great Jeff buckley. But that's all Ours is, a 2nd rate Jeff Buckley. Jimmy Gnecco is a dead ringer in vocal style and looks to Jeff. He has amazing talent but needs to find his own identity before people start to catch on. I recommend you go and buy Buckley's ""Grace"" first, it's the just thing to do."
5,A vital addition to any music collection,"With the raging passions of a genuine poet, complimented by an unyielding soulful melody, The Ours could capture the hearts of any music lover. Roaring on to the mainstream scene in 2000, with their strangely beautiful album Distorted Lullabies, they truly established themselves as a notable rock act. It is now 2 years later and they have done it again! With the long awaited release of their new album, Precious, Ours fans new and old will undoubtedly be overcome by the brilliance of their latest creations. Vocalist, Jimmy Gnecco bursts with a spiritual intensity seen in few modern front men, adding further vigour to their already remarkable songs. Their first single, Leaves has ruptured music stations all over North America, leaving many listeners entranced and wanting more. Fulfillment and total bliss can only be found in the purchase and incessant listening of this spectacular record."
5,lovely lovely album,"i can't say too many good things about 'precious'. i love every single song but especially 'places', 'chapter 2' and 'broken'. jimmy gnecco's screaming in the last two songs is amazing and unreal. this album is somewhat different from 'distorted lullabies' but still has the same dark, gorgeous sound. i don't know how to classify ours' sound but i very strongly recommend both this album and 'distorted lullabies' for anyone who likes metal, alternative, goth or anyone who's looking to expand their tastes."
5,like buckley? U2? radiohead?,"this cd is AMAZING. jimmy gnecco has an amazing vocal range and great very unique songs. Realize is an especially good song. I luv this cd...i would recommend it to anyone who likes real, honest music."
5,Marvelous: as good as Distorted Lullabies if not better,"Ours is, to put it simply, unbelievable. Their first CD, Distorted Lullabies, was amazing, and this new release is just as marvelous. This CD is one of the best out there. Ours is not only a unique band, but one that gives relief (to me and many other fans) from the songs that you hear every day on the radio...songs that all sound the same. Jimmy Gnecco's voice has a quality that cannot be found anywhere else; the intensity and feeling with which he sings is amazing...unable to be described. Precious is perfect; that's all that can be said."
2,Disappointing Lullabies,"""Precious"" was a complete disappointment... the music and lyrics seem to be meaningless. I felt absolutely nothing when listening to this album. All I could do was shake my head in utter horror after hearing such songs as ""Kill The Band"" and ""In A Minute"" which wasted Gnecco's potentially beautiful voice. There are a few songs in ""Precious"" that remind one of Gnecco's vocal talent but the emotion is flat and the lyrics are dull..."
3,Hmmm...,"Well, I'm a BIG fan of distorted Lullabies, and I have only given this album a listen once through. It has a much more pop sound, and I can't say the vocals are as good as the last record, but it's definitely solid. This album is recommended, but not a 5 star album like the previous project. The recording style is much different, they use a lot less musicians, and they have a grittier sound quality to the recording."
2,too sticky and too salty,"This product is simply okay ... definitely not great or very tasty. It is a bit too sticky, even for a risotto. Also, they added WAY TOO much salt. I cooked it exactly according to the directions so maybe next package (it came in a case of 6) I'll have to add more water than it calls for and see how that works. I don't recommend this product unless you like your risotto really sticky and really salty. I'm going to stick with Trader Joe's version in the future."
1,Great! (when it WORKS),"This was a great game. For about a month. Then the controls quit working on our keyboard. As you can see, our keyboard works quite nicely. However when we put the controls on the keyboard, they only respond for about a minute. Customer service is a joke- Hasbro sold their software division to another company and this other company still hasn't responded to the support e-mail I wrote a month ago. If you want a hassle free interactive game that has the same higher order thinking and problem solving GO BUY the Thomas the Train game, we've had no problems with it."
2,Buyer Beware!,"We love this game....when it works. The graphics are great and Tonka Joe is a nice addition to help kids navigate through all the different tasks. I have tried this game on three different computers I own; a generic, a Gateway, and a brand new Dell. I have also tried this game under three different o/s; Win 95, 98se, and XP. It has never worked well on any of them. You are more likely to arrange a meeting with the Pope on Easter than you are to reach any customer support people that are helpful. My son shed tears three different times while trying to get this game to work. I have spent untold hours trying different tactics and downloading updates to run this game error free. I have requested a new cd three times only to be told to try some other fix first. Unfortunately, we have the controls for the game, but no game. We have put the controls and the cd to good use. My son likes to pretend he is playing the game with the controls, and the cd has become our new indoor frisbee."
5,Hours of entertainment,My three year old son loves this. He operates it all on his own with no problem. This offers many different activities so that they never tire of it. You have to have it!
5,"As a hand me down, it still works....","I've read several of the bad reviews about broken software and controls. We received this game and controls as a hand me down from a neighbor who's child has out grown it. It is now running quite nicely on my Gateway XP box and the controls have now gone thru 2 kids and haven't shown any signs of wearing. The controls do come off the keyboard sometimes when my daughter pulls or twists the wheel too hard, but that is easily fixed.I guess with any product you can expect to find a few bad versions, but mine has worked like a charm. She'll sit and play for an hour before I have to pull her off the computer, most often crying cuz she has to stop."
5,2+ Years Of Fun,My 4-year old has loved this game since before he was 2. He still can play it for hours and has learned to play it together with his friends. They'll take turns driving or will divide up the controls and work together as a team. Now he's introducing his younger sister to it (19 months) and she loves it as well.Our controller has stood up to over 2 years of use.
5,"A ""Must Have"" Game",I bought this game for my 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old sons for Christmas. They absolutely love it.It has several different Tonka trucks for them to drive thru town and stop in many different places. Each Truck has a mission at each stop. The instructions are easy for the children to follow and fun for them to play.The set does sometimes slip off the keys on my curved keyboard. The kids had to learn to move it gently (Not a necessarily a bad thing).I also have Windows XP. Several programs that I have purchased do not work on XP. But the Dig N Rig does. The only bad part is that I would like to have my computer w/out arguing with my boys.A Must Have!!!
3,fustrated,The playset does not fit on key boards that are not rectangle very good. My son gets upset because in the middle of playing the playset moves just enough that I have to reset it up for him. Our key board is curved on the bottom alittle. I think the key boards that are staight on the bottom would work better.
4,Great Fun!!,"We bought this game for our 3 year old for his birthday and it is great. He can operate the game himself. The game tells you which gear to pull (by telling its color). We have a new baby at home so it is nice to have a game that he can operate himself so that he doesn't need constant assistance sitting next to him. Hooking this game up is SO easy. There are no wires for the keyboard. It just sits on top of the keyboard and when the levers are pulled it presses down on the keyboard button.This is perfect for a young child who always seems to be too little for the big kid computer games. However, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone younger than 3. My nephew is 6 and he has this same game and loves it."
4,My son loves this toy.,My son has just turned 3 and he really enjoys playing this game. The dashboard fits nicely over a standard keyboard and the strap holds it in place nicely. The only thing that is a down side is the keyboard does move around a little when he uses the controls. There is one activity that is too difficult for him to master and that is the activity at the gas station. That is just a small part of this game. My son loves the 4 vehicles used and has a couple favorite activities he likes to do in the game. He loves feeding the animals with the end-loader and loves knocking down buildings with the crane and wrecking ball. I would highly recommend this game for any child that enjoys computer games.
5,GREAT,I bought this for my son (4 years old) last year for Christmas. I can tell you he loves it. My daughter is three and really enjoys it also. We have 23 kids on our block alone. So we have children over all the time. They always want to play Tonka's Dig'n Rigs when they come over. We have to have a timer so everyone gets a turn.
5,The best toy ever!,"My son who is 2.5 loves this game, and it is excellent in developing hand and eye coordination. He also has learn skills that involve left and right movement! Far better than watching TeleTubbies."
5,Squeals with Delight!,"I unknowingly bought this product for my four year old son at Christmas, 2001. He was able to handle all the instruction himself. The drive attachment enables him to do everything and doesn't need to know which is the ""k"" or ""j"" on the keyboard to get the tasks done. It teaches him to do one step at a time, therefore, he cannot jump ahead. He can relate to the different scenaries offered and squeals with delight while playing it. Now, his 2 yr old sister also joins in the fun! They both love the big rigs and easily have hours of fun playing."
2,Customer Service...,"I suppose the Tonka Dig'n Rigs game might be good if our disk would have worked properly. As it is, our disk appears to be defective and it has been a continuing nightmare trying to contact anyone at ""Hasbro Interactive"" to get any service (and this is while it is still under warranty). First they don't have an 800 number, and then, while you are racking up long distance charges you get to sit through an endless amount of automative messages. I would say just pray that you don't have a problem with the product as the customer service [STINKS]!"
2,A huge disappointment!,"We bought this set and my 3 boys just loved playing with it. However, it the midst of playing, a part that controls the steering wheel as it moves to the right broke off inside the playset and therefore, they cannot play the game anymore. I contacted Atari, which currently owns the game, and was disappointed when they told me I would have to purchase an entirely new game! I don't think I want to spend another $100 on this game that might just break again."
5,great product,this switch works great. Have to use it with a maestro master dimmer which is a lot more exspensive but well worth it. You can add several of these to the circuit and it allows you to dim the lights from multiple switches. Very practical.
1,Don't buy... it's junk,"I bought two of these junky dimmer switches within a month at Lowe's and both fell apart within two weeks of installation. I have a third in a second bathroom and I'm holding my breath waiting for it to fall apart. The switch plate tends to fall right off. At the $30 a piece I paid, you would think the quality would be better."
4,If Spanish Train is a five...,"I waited for this cd with great anticipation as I am agreat fan of Chris de Burgh, have been since Spanish Train. Chris is at his best singing stories (like St Peters Gate on this cd) and of course his melodic ballads and love songs.Is this cd worth having? Absolutely! He experiments more (Natasha Dance is like a Russian folk song, When I think Of You runs verse into chorus in an interesting way)and his melodies are still excellent. And his voice? Still pure and still capable of changing from haunting to edgy in the same line."
3,Lord Will and Her Grace,"Lord Will and Her Grace,Easy read, but predictable. Ccharacters were too shallow. But, entertaining. Still enjoyed any historical aspect"
4,I like it,"I like it. I will definitely buy more of this author's books. I love a good storyline, that credits the heroine with a little intelligence."
1,Short Life Span,I learned my lesson the hard way. I purchased this case based on my computer technician's recommendation and shortly afterwords the door on the front fell off. It is 100% plastic and cannot tolerate much use. I purchased a second case to replace the first in my office. Again in a matter of months the front door plastic hinges gave way and the the door fell off. If they had made the door and hinges out of metal it would have been a good case. Do NOT purchase this case. If you want a GREAT case get a Cooler Master caseCooler Master HAF X Full Tower w/ SuperSpeed USB 3.0 w/ Window w/ Black Interior ATX Case (RC-942-KKN1). That is what I did. I love it and it is nothing short of phenomenal.
5,Looking forward to reading this,"I have just recently inquired with Mr. Doty about ordering this book directly from him as I hear he will sign them. I have a rather unique perspective as my Grandfather was captain (master) of the Cape Greig, the Merchant Marine cargo ship which picked the author out of the sea when his plane was forced to ditch when it ran out of fuel. I have a letter from the commander of the 19th bombardment group (you can see the text of it here at the bottom of the page: http://www.usmm.org/rescue.html ) , thanking his ship for the rescue and listing the four airmen who were rescued including Mr. Doty. I have read a little about the book and Mr. Doty online and it seems that up to eight of the crew were saved so I'll be interested to read his account and see if another ship was involved in the rescue."
4,Perfect match,"Difficult to find this kind of photo book. I had one for my dad and needed a similar one for my father-in-law. Now thanks to Godinger, I have a good match. I even went back and purchased a second one just to have on hand."
3,"Why is this series called the ""Ultimate Collection""?","What it should be called is the ""We Forgot They Invented STEREO Collection"". The entire CD is in mono."
5,a great vocal group,hearing them sing is a wonderful feeling for the human ears.their songs are timeless.they are very underrated.the voices&the arrangements&the music hold up to this day.a great collection of songs from one of musics most important Female groups of all-time.
1,Wish I was able to sample first or read more about this item,"For some reason I thought this was some kind of remix by The Sundays. It's not. The band Tin Tin Out covered the song, and I could not get through 20 seconds of listening to it. My bad, and I take responsibility for that.Sample the music before you buy if you have not already heard it."
2,Cleo's Mood:A Combo Of Bands,"On the track,""Cleo's Mood"",it sounds like something that BookerT.And The MG's,along with the Mar-Key Horns would've cut.It sounds Like Steve Cropper on the guitar,and Booker T.Jones on the keyboards.The sax style is definately Jr.It's a soothing piece."
5,Motown's gritty-soul sax man!,"Junior Walker, as was stated in the liner notes, never considered himself to be a star. Humility gets you places and with a wailing saxophone sound like this; mmm, man! To Motown fans, Junior Walker rarely gets the full spotlight. This completely flawless 25-track set shows you what this guy could do. Not only with that sax but the rest of the band delivering that hot, gritty, get-down sound! ""Shake and Fingerpop"", for oneexample, is a dance classic that deserves more attention. Opening with drums and a prolonged high-pitched vibrato note. The beat, the rhythm and the bass just makes you ""get out on the floor and dance like you never could before."" Another hot example, ""(I'm A) Road Runner""; that's right up there with ""Shotgun."" This wasn't your typical, stylized Motown soul; this was soul to the nth degree. I hope it won't be too hot for those expecting typical Motown sounds. You've just found one of the most satisfying of the Motown Ultimate Collections."
3,Sound quality is only fair,"I'm replacing a beat LP that's been played to death. I love Jr. Walker and this is a great collection, so I got it, but the sound quality is not nearly as good as the original Motown LP. I'm listening with headphones and right from the beginning, Shotgun sounds like it's coming from over a distance and the sound's all in a lump (it's mono). I'm so disappointed, but then I listen to samples of the Definitive Collection CD and it's more immediate and warmer, more of a live sound; and the shot at the beginning of Shotgun goes from the right ear to the left, in stereo just like on the LP. So I break down and download that CD too (like I said I love Jr. Walker's music). The Definitive Collection's a superior recording, and I recommend it over the Ultimate Collection. 5 stars for Jr. Walker's music, but only 3 for this CD."
2,lacking,"When I saw that the run time was over an hour I thought that would make for a relatively comprehensive presentation. It's anything but. Vast regions of the United Kingdom are presented in twenty five minute segments, and of that entire region, a couple little eateries and a historical land mark will be picked at random, quickly glossed over and sandwiched between random images that receive no explanation. Overall, you won't see or learn much from the presentation, and there's not even enough substance for it to be useful as a travel guide. It's plays like a short preview for what could have been something much bigger and better. I guess I've been spoiled by Rick Steves' more thorough product, but sadly, Rick Steves' series is not offered in bluray. I had looked forward to buying this series, but I must stop at just this one. The video is sharp but the lack of content relative to the run time is too disappointing to get past."
1,Very Poor Quality Video,"Too much of the video is washed out. With film you would say it was overexposed, but this was surely shot with an HD camera. Can not understand why anyone would release material of such poor quality. Interesting, but they ruined it with very poor video."
5,Dreamworks is crazy!!!,"To begin with, i'd like to say that the soundtrack is one of the very best i have ever listened to. Unfortunately, I can only listen to it from playing the game, which is hard. I havent been able to find that soundtrack anywhere, for a reasonable price. I have found ones for $60 and above, which is crazy and obsurd. My main point is saying that this soundtrack deserves to be sold by Dreamworks in stores again for a longer period of time. If they did, it would be a great moneymaker for them."
5,P,"Michael Giacchino has really out done himself on this album. Starting out with sustained strings and a lone trumpet, he sets the the mood for honor. Soon, he takes that same theme and produces a heroic march that calls you into action. In the 2Track, Locating Enemy Positions, he produces the suspense and a relentless driving beat that makes you determined to be victorious on you mission. I love music that stands on its own and you can let your imagination run wild. I have not played this game, so I can envision many different scenes in my mind where this music could be used. For those, that have a good imagination, create a scene where a Jedi knight and a Sith are using the force to find each other; Then in Track 3, they find each other and begin their duel. This whole album is one that will give you endless hours of enjoyment. Enjoy!"
3,Wolf Wing,"The previous books were very exciting and I'd expected the final one to be too. I just finished reading it and it was exciting but not as much as the first three books. In the middle it had lots of details with made it kind of boring because it practically took up half the book! The other parts were good though. If they make a new one, hopefully is more interesting and amusing to make up for the fourth one. Wolf Wing is a good book despite some of the minor parts."
2,Ehh...,"It wasn't as good as the other books... Perhaps it's because I read the others as a group years before, but this seems to just be tagged on the end."
3,Not as good as the first three,"I was really looking forward to this book because I liked the first 3 so much. Once I read it, I was a little disappointed. Kind of boring...."
2,A bad ending to a series with a great start,"The first book of this series was definitely the best, in my opinion. As the series continues, the plot twists get infinitely more confusing, and you find yourself lost in the happenings. This last book was such a disappointment - the reasons for everything were almost too complicated to understand, and I had to cross reference all the other books in order to remember what exactly was going on and what had happened.If you're looking for a great read, read the first book. If you want to continue into a series that you will eventually extremely dislike, keep reading."
4,great book yet too slow,this book was great.The one thing that really bothered me was that at times the detailes were being dragged out and making it very frustrating to read. I was quite satisfied with the ending although i am usually very specific about endings. i hope that if tanith lee writes a fifth book it will end any further questions and not be quite as confusing
4,Some of the Best,"""A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day)"" is THE best song from the girl groups; it alone is worth the price of this album. And there are so many more. Martha is a national treasure.This is great music, the only drawback is the sound quality: seems it could have been remastered for clarity."
5,The Ultimate-And Best-Collection!,"There is not a single bad song on this CD. It contains all the favorite titles that made Martha and the Vandellas such a fantastic girl group. The clarity is first rate. I pop it into my CD player whenever I feel the need to groove along to some of the best music around.If anything, this CD brings home the fact that Martha and the Vandellas, along with other top female groups like the Shangri-Las and the Supremes showed the world that the gals could provide all-male groups with some stiff competition.If you like Martha and company at all, you cannot go wrong by purchasing this fine and truly Ultimate Collection."
3,Lots of potential,"Musically, this is a very solid album. Lyrically, however, it was somewhat weak. I look forward to future releases, but I would not reccomend picking this one up."
3,yech,This one only gets 3 stars because the single Normal Life is a fantastic song. The rest.....garbage. If you wanna check these guys out just buy the cd single or Normal Life and save urself some bucks.
5,Loved It,I got this CD because I had heard Normal Life a few times on the radio and really liked JFK's unique sound. I have played the Cd non stop and am still not sick of it. I would definitely recommend this Cd to anyoone who wants a change of pace and some genuinely good lyrics.
2,not a lot of sympathy for rigid religious beliefs,"Although because of their number the Amish aren't considered a cult,their behavior lands in that category.Here the shape of a barn roof causes big problemsand they almost get some ""English' intodeep trouble. Religious freedom is a ""fiction"" in the United States:that became clear with the sending of Islamic fundamentalists toCuba in the Bush administration. Quakers and Amish and Latter Day Saints( Mormons)are a few of the people who have been persecuted long term for being different.WASP and Catholic are the ""norm"" that is tolerated.Except for not using modern machines the Amish arevery like a lot of other Protestant sects;more like Hasidic fundamentalist Jews than Christians maybe?I don't think that hating people for their religion is good, butsome religions are actually damaging to the people involvedlong term.I don't think we should encourage people to think suchbehavior is all right. The results are a very thornycivil rights problem."
4,Sorthern Rock Still alive and GREAT!!,"This isn't the best LP, but is still good, Little Piece of Dixie is ONE GREAT CD. Still waiting for the next CD form these guys. The bootlegs CD is also a good CD with some great songs, but by far the Little Piece of Dixie is thier best so far. So guys we are waiting for the next Great CD form You, Don't lets us down!GREAT SOUTHERN ROCK & ROLL!!!"
4,Good product,"This is the second one of these that we purchased. I like the heated option, it makes all the difference when you need to dry boots or shoes quickly. The problem that we experienced was with the knob on the product, it was poorly constructed and broke prematurely."
4,"Good Dryer, Although Noisy","We use this for heating ski boots and gloves, for drying damp gloves, and our son dries his damp athletic shoes. The fan is noisy, but it works well and I haven't seen a better device for this purpose. You can heat or dry two pair of shoes or two pair of gloves at once. We've had it a couple of years now, no problems with it. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of the fan noise and the fact that drying takes rather a long time. I'm not sure the drying time could actually be improved since a lot of heat probably can't be used. You can turn it in with or without heat, and the fan time just comes from how far you turn the knob (no way of knowing how long it will run...you just have to note where you set the knob and see how long it takes, to get an idea)."
5,Warm and Dry,This is a must-have product for those of us that live in snowy regions and even more so if you have children. I love the auto shut-off feature. The unit does not get too hot so you can use it with confidence.
3,"Adequate, but . . .","I bought this last year for ski boots. It worked ok, but the biggest problem is that it tends to tip over if the load is not balanced. So I end up loading it back-left, front-right, back-right, then front-left. It works, but a little awkward.Also, for some ski boots & buckles, the posts are too close together, so it required ADDITIONAL planning to load it so that everything fits.Also, my recollection is that the air is not really WARM, just adequate.Bottom line: I will probably continue to use this. But I will be buying a similar item as a present this Christmas, and am looking for a different brand/model, that may not have these issues."
4,Does what I expected of it,"Very satisfied so far with this Boot/Glove Dryer.If you need to dry Heavy Boots, all youneed to do is make sure they are balanced left-right/front-back, and the unit will not tipover."
5,Had to have it!,"I saw this at a friend's home and we had to have it. It is great for drying hockey gear, wet sledding stuff or warming up gloves before heading out to shovel snow. We love it and cannot imagine what we did before we had it. We know other people who use it for lacrosse equipment and drying out hiking boots. Who knows what other stinking sports stuff can be dried out with this great machine!"
5,big enough to hold size 184E,"Really surprised to find that the product could hold a size 18 work boot, and still be so compact. I was also surprised to find the noise level was not annoying too. Fabulous product. Has saved me a ton of money too. Not having to replace nasty boots. The reviews are real. This product really does work, just like they say."
1,Not enough power,There wasn't enough power to dry the boots and gloves. I plan on returning it because it was a gift for my husband for Christmas and he isn't happy at all with it!
4,DryGuy Boot Dryer a little spendy but works great,"We use the DryGuy Boot Dryer nearly every day. Although it is a little spendy it works great for drying boots, shoes, gloves and other things. It would be even better if it was a little heavier so that it wouldn't require careful balancing of heavy boots to prevent it from toppling over and if it had air vents further down on the drying posts for more thorough drying of items open at the top (like knee braces). And while most items dried just fine in three hours using the heat setting, it would be nice if it had an ""on"" setting for things needing a longer drying time (such as when drying thick items without heat)."
4,DryGuy,"Great at drying boots. I am a size 11, my ski boots flip the base over if i dont put another pair of boots on it . I am concerned about the drying wands as they seriously flex when i put my ski boots on. I hope they continue to hold up as they are supposed to."
1,Flimsy build. Doesn't blow air into the toe. Not worth the $$$,"I expected a much more solid build for EIGHTY BUCKS!!!It's very flimsy. If you bend the boot support posts inward the plastic starts pulling apart. You must balance the boots or the unit tips over since it's SO SMALL and a footprint and light weight. It's MUCH smaller than it looks in the photos.The air doesn't blow in the direction of the toe which is where most people sweat the most. The toe doesn't get warm after a long drying time, the air blows out every direction and pitifully weak.Also, the drying posts are not TALL ENOUGH, so in my boots (size 9 1/2) the top doesn't reach the sole of the boot, another reason the air doesn't seem to reach the toe.I think I will return this, not worth $80, maybe worth $40.SmittyNYUSA"
2,DryGuy,"While this works fine, note that it is much smaller than you would think, and is not really large enough for ski boots and gloves at the same time. Also, becuase it is so small, if you have it loaded with boots, it tends to tip over."
5,As advertised,"This is the one item that gets used in our house everyday, all winter. Especially if you have kids, you will not be disappointed. The large, sturdy base and timer is what separates this dryer from others."
5,Fabulous for drying kids mittens/gloves!!,"We've had this for about a month and love it! It works great for drying out the inside of mittens and gloves. In the past, we have tried to dry waterproof mittens in the dryer, but the insides stayed wet. Now, we when the kids come inside from playing in the snow, we put the mittens on this for 60-90 minutes and the insides are dry!! (Works for adult gloves and mittens too!). We have also used to dry boot linings that have gotten soaked in deep snow...worked great."
4,Great dryer for hockey---may stop heating,"I have two of these (as well as two Thermanators) and they work well; however, after about a year of use, the heat on one unit no longer operates---it still blows air (and we still use it) but it's not hot anymore (yes, the heat switch is on.)Our kids play ice hockey and DryGuy was made for wet hockey gear; I highly recommend both this item and their Thermanator, which works well when you're not in a rush (and is a great place to hang their skates, gloves, and helmet, between games and practices after drying.)"
3,Dries fast if you don't mind the gym locker smell,"This product does as it says - dries shoes/boots and dries them quite fast. Unfortunately, I was not able to get past the side effect of the gym locker smell that the warm air produces. If smell is of concern I would recommend the Thermanator as it uses passive radiant heat rather than fan blown hot air."
1,Complete piece of crap!!!,"I bought the my first Dryguy for a Christmas present for my son (a hockey player). He was excited to get it on Christmas morning until I opened the box. I was not factory wrapped and look like it was a return. Thanks Amazon for selling returned products. We plugged it in, turned it on and there was hardly any air coming out of the arms. Not even enough to blow out a match held right next to it. I emailed Amazon and they sent another one right away. I just opened the box, plugged it in and same thing. No heat comes out. It makes no difference if you turn on the heat switch or not. Avoid this product at all costs and will not give them another chance."
1,DryGuy Breaks down,I recently purchased 2 DryGuy Wide Body Boot and Glove Dryers. One out of two works great. The second shorted out after a few uses.DryGuy Wide-Body Boot and Glove Dryer. Amazon was great about replacing the broken one and we will see how long it lasts.
1,Dryguy motor problems,"I got a dryguy DG1 and after two seasons the motor went out, the one year warrenty is useless. and to hae it repaired would cost $40. or more and then what is going to fail next.For a $90. unit you would think it would last longer."
5,Excellent Gift For Skiers,"I gave this to my husband but it's for both of us. We have sports that entail wet clothes, mountain biking and skiing. We dry everything like gloves, shoes, boots on this heater and it works great. It's so helpful when you needs things for your next day's ride to be dry."
1,Piece of junk,"The first unit I was shipped didn't work at all. The very first time I tried to use it, the smell of a burning electric motor filled the room, along with a light gray smoke. Beyond that, it's really just a cheaply made item. The controls are poorly designed, making you guess how much time you are setting it to run for; the physical setup of the boot holders is awkward and not adjustable; and the whole unit is made of flimsy plastic that one or two accidentally dropped ski boots will break. For the price, I would expect a MUCH better product."
3,DryGuy boot & glove dryer,"While it works great for gloves, heavy work boots that are soakedtake a few (8) cycles to dry completely. To be fair the boots were saturated. The size is perfect and stores easily. It's very easy to use without reading the instructions (for Men). Still a good value for the money."
5,Great product,"I bought this from Amazon a couple of years ago and it has worked great. Although made out of that cheap China plastic, it really does pump out some heat and will dry the insides of your boots and gloves like no household dryer can. If I only had one pair of boots or gloves to dry, I just put some masking tape over the other outlets and it worked great."
4,wet feet in Seattle,"Husband here...writing on behalf of SeattleMama. i commute by bike in the rain most days here in Seattle. my wife got me one for the office and one for home and, frankly, it's been awesome! it's nice not to have to put wet shoes on for the ride home and to have dry shoes available for the next morning. I really would give it a 4.5 if that rating were available. I think my only ""gripe"" is that I have size 13 shoes and i just can't see this thing holding two pairs of ski boots that size, although admittedly I haven't tried it. Maybe I'm sore that this is such a simple, effective device and I didn't design it first."
4,cool drier,I got this very quickly and it seems to work properly. It's for my boots & gloves in the winter. I like it because its small and compact.
4,Handy Item,"Nice product. I especially like the no-heat feature for items that only need a little drying. The timer is a bit awkward as you have to turn it all the way to maximum time, then set it back to the desired time. This can create an issue with the timer not actually turning off. I've had it run all night a couple of times due to this."
4,Good product,Easy to use. Like the dual glove/boot drying ability. Not terribly attractive but function is what is important. Price was almost $50.00 higher through a popular catalogue and at a local outfitter.
4,Continued greatness,"Based on my enjoyment and constant playing of Ghetto Love, I purchased Still Ghetto. Honestly I was prepared to be disappointed because I believe Ghetto Love is one of the all-time great R&B/Soul albums, comparing favorably with What's Going On, arguably the greatest R&B album. On the first listen I was not impressed because he did not appear to have moved very far from Still Ghetto. On subsequent hearings, I became mesmerized and now play this CD at least once every other day just to hear Jaheim update Teddy's sound. My only complaint is Jaheim sharing the vocal load with background singers. Someone should tell the record company the fans want to hear pure Jaheim and to keep that voice up front and center at all times. Suggest real fans catch Jaheim sing the words to one of 50 cent's raps in the making of the Backtight video. What a great voice."
4,A cross between Luther and Teddy P................,Jaheim's old school vibe continues on this joint from 2002. Pretty good album. Check it out.Top Joints:Fabulous - (featuring Tha Rayne)Put That Woman FirstMe And My B*tchBacktightTight JeansBeauty And A Thug - (featuring Mary J. Blige)
5,I LoveThis Man's Voice!!!!!,"Let me first start by saying that I am a smooth jazz lover, long since given up the cheap sound of hip-hop/R & B(new school) that is until I saw Jaheim in concert twice as an opening act for a couple of true blue old school groups. I have to say that I was absolutely taken aback by the voice!!! Then I went out an bought both of his albums (and not from the corner hustler!). This young man can really sing and without the help of machines to enhance his voice. He is truly talented and I just want to give him the props he deserves. ""Do the D**m thang Jah""! You the man and with a voice like that along with good business sense, you will be around crooning to us for a long, long, time."
4,Hot to def and STILL GHETTO,The joint is off the hook Jaheim uses his skills to the utmost with a smooth ballard to a talked over phat beat only the way Jahiem knows how. go cop this cause the looped MP3s are just unfair to what this sounds like on CD quaility. HOLLA
2,I guess I have a change of heart,I beg to differ but this sophmore album is not as good as the first.It really lack the the hunger of the first.I was glad to see that he was not a one hit wonder but I am not happy with the work of this CD.It seems that the songs Drag on and on from start to finish.Maybe next time
5,Best R&B/Soul Album in Ten Years,"You looking for love? You looking for realness? You looking for soul? You looking for Teddy P and Luther, but dont wanna turn out the lights in your house thats not a home? Then recognize that Jaheim is ""Still Ghetto"" in this release of a lifetime. This will be a signature album for the up and coming R&B/Soul prince of the new millenium. If you wanna know the realness that is Ghetto and Love combined, you gotta copp this one!Peace Unto Yall!Polytyshan a.k.a Kreap"
4,Good 2nd album,"I am not 13 years old, I was just lazy to enter in correctly, however, I like this album alot especially ""Fabulous"" ""diamond in da ruff"" ""Backtight."" However everyone says Jaheim sound like Teddy, but I differ. I am old school and I believe he delivers like Miles Jaye instead. How many remember Miles Jaye? Jaheim is smoother than TP. TP sand with more gut and sexuality. Jaheim also finishes more like Luther, but he reminds me alot of Miles Jaye, and how I wish Miles would come back on the scene. Miles knew how to REALLY sing to the women without all the profanity, and he knew how to make the guys listen and want to listen even more to let them know actually what to tell the ladies."
2,Not my cup of tea....,"I usually like off-beat and stange books. But I just didn't enjoy this one much. First let me say this book is EXTREMELY short. Its listed at 92 pages but several of those are adds and other filler. It also has illustrations and HUGE type. I honestly think with a normal type setting this would be about a 10 page short story. I read it in 20 minutes.Its very original and strange, which is good. But I didn't find it humorous other than the joke of the title itself. After you get over the shock of two people sticking the baby Jesus where the sun don't shine the joke wears thin.I guess its worth buying if you don't mind paying 10 bucks for such a short book."
4,I always knew there was something odd about that Jesus guy,"This was my second foray into not only Mellick's work, but the genre of Bizarro in general. This is one of those stories that to me, gets better with age. The first time I read this, I was in awe of the things I was reading - now I'm a very jaded fellow - but never before have I read a book from a publisher that was like the most delicious burrito for my brain. It contains everything my mind finds scrumptious: a smorgasbord of gratuitous sex, surreal office buildings, viscous violence, religious allusions, genetic modification, and zombies. Yes, you can find them all here in is quick read. The incorporation of randomly place oddities like doorknob growths and ballerina brains are like finding a Skittle in a bowl of Life cinnamon cereal,a very welcome addition. If you are new to Bizarro, this is avoid place to start and if you are a Bizarro vet, give it read again and revisit a tale that will assuredly make your cheeks swell with grins."
4,Vertigo Conducive,"You know that feeling you get when you walk to the edge of a skyscraper window 100 stories up and put your forehead against the glass (and just for a second you feel like the glass might give and you'll go toppling head over heels to the pavement) and your belly starts to swirl and rise towards your throat and you get light headed?That's the feeling of this book, from page one. There's some nasty business, some big laughs, and an overall sensation of things being wrong in the best way. But what you might not expect (amidst the melting clones, abstract sex, and zombie carnage) is the strange poignancy of the final pages that make this more than a surreal jerk-around.This is a headsquisher of a book."
3,Um.... I made a mistake.,"Yeah, turns out that this is a book.... I didn't know that when I originally made the purchase. I should really moderate my impulse control.Color me embarrassed."
3,Suddently zombies,"This was my second ever bizarro book. It was the only thing I asked my best friend to get me for my 17th birthday. Of course no book stores around here carry books like this so she had to ask them to special order it. What a good friend she was.It's written and styled like a children's book with large text, simple dialogue, and cute pictures.A couple adopt a baby jesus butt plug...a living butt plug. They name it Bobby and it likes them. Everything is going well and then the butt plug crucifies itself and becomes a music box? Whoa. Then suddenly zombies and closet sex.I'm not sure I can think of a better way to explain it. So you're just going to have to read it yourself and then when you're drunk and/or trying to out-weird or impress friends/acquaintances you can proudly tell them that on your bookshelf lives a book called Baby Jesus Butt Plug. Not saying I've done this but I totally have and it totally works."
5,A Bizarro Masterpiece,"Ignore the low star reviews, if your reading this and thinking about buying the book; do it. You will not be disappointed with this very rich adult fairy tale. Mellick uses the premises of cloned Baby Jesuss being used for butt plugs to explore the nature of religion and what it does to a person. The strange set pieces of the book work as wonderful metaphors, for the emptiness that being ""filled"" with Christ brings. Highly Recommended."
1,CMIII aka Jackass Von Jackass,"I am absolutely pissed that I paid $9 for this book and even more pissed that I read half of it. What a piece of sh#t of a book! Mr. Mellick is swimming in a sea of retarded adlib sexuality. I'm making this short; the book doesn't even deserve this much of a review. Save yourself the $9 and buy something else, anything else."
4,"Strange, yet fascinating","Another winner from surrealist author Carlton Mellick III. This a strange, bleak, and utterly weird tale has everything you would expect from the master....psuedo-horror, sci-fi, twisted religion, and dark satire. Throw in some dirty humor, and you have one crazy ride! Recommended."
4,A Warped Bizarro Classic,"Y'know, I'm not going to summarize the plot of this book, because you're either going to be on board for a fairy tale about cloned Jesuses used as marital aids (and the zombie offspring they produce) or you're not. If you are, you'll enjoy this warped little fable about corporate dehumanization and familial yearnings, and the way Mellick simply yet colorfully spins his tale.Yes, BJBP is fundamentally a short story with large typeface and illustrations to just barely justify a book-length page count, but it's also highly entertaining and holds up to repeat readings. And in the canon of Bizarro lit (has it really been around long enough to have one?), it's an important part of the genre's infancy."
5,Copper handled Whip.,I really do not use this item. It is in the Cady on my cupboards. I find all the other copper items I have purchased work great.
5,Awesome whisk,"Great price, great whisk. A must for someone who likes to beat things :) Nice copper handle also, matches your copper bowl. You have one of those too, right?"
4,Interesting look at days gone by.,Mammy Jane is related distantly to some of my cousins. Interesting look back at an early way of life and how hard life was.
5,Mammy Jane Review,"This book is fantastic. Sibyl Jarvis Pischke is my uncles neice. My grandparents and family were mentioned in the book. If you liked this book, there is another one book called ""Ashes of Roses and War"". The characters in this book are Thomas's sister Jane and his grandfather. It takes place at the same time and they are a Doctor and Nurse during the Civil War. These books are well worth the reading."
1,Binding Ungluing,Just received this book and the binding is about 80% un-glued. Poor quality and Very disappointed. The content of the book is excellent... I have the First Edition.I have no idea if it is worth sending back... or how to even go about doing so. :(
5,Cowgirls at best,"As a historian and teacher, I often find original articles and photographs as the best teaching aids possible. Although traveling photographers often staged photos, they also used items of clothing and props associated with the times, thus providing a visual study of articles. Oral history is also at times incorrect since memories & viewpoints often aren't completely correct. But, once again the visual item helps determining truth from fiction. This book is an excellect and colorfull collection of garments, photos, postcards, etc. spanding many years of the cowgirl. Items are stated to be unknown if the author is in question of its actual origin. The photos are very clear and are an easy study and the information is very informative."
3,hard to install,I may install this later. The problem is the tiny hose that gets kinked easily in the gravel. Perhaps this was meant to be installed in fine substrate!!!
2,"Not the best, but still good for a few kicks",I have seen worse Bass fishing games but this one still deserves some credit. Nice action but bad graffix.
4,Buen telefono,"Este ha sido el mejor telefono que he tenido. NO es de gama alta pero todas las funciones están adecuadamente organizadas. Lo mejor es su diseño, su peso liviano, la resistencia a los golpes es altisima. La pantalla LCD de 16 millones de colores es muy buena. Las fotos que he tomado de dia son de buena resolucion. Para escuchar musica es agradable. No lo dudes, compralo.CONTRAS: Solo acepta tarjetas microSD de hasta 2 GB, si le pones una tarjeta de mayor capacidad el telefono se bloquea. La camara no tiene flash. El sonido que registra cuando graba un video es malo."
3,Elegant and complete,I bought it and I was surprised that it is elegant and complete his cell.It has everything anyone could ask for.Not good is the USB cable is sold separately.Need more strength in speakers.Need a little more sound to the headset.No battery lasts a long time as the manual says.But the price is purchase again.
4,Simple yet Brilliant,"I am very pleased with this phone. While it lacks the bells and whistles of the N Series, it does what a phone should do, and perfectly might I add. The display, the ease of use, the simplicity of the interface, the reception, etc, make up for the lack of gadgets and buttons.Furthermore, it feels incredibly sturdy and solid, with brushed aluminium components and such a detailed, clear screen.My only reservations are in regards to it's non phone components, namely the lack of mirror and flash in the camera. While well lit day shots come out very well, indoor low light situations leave a little to wish for.I would recommend this phone without reservations if you are seeking a good, elegant and simple phone."
4,Great value for the price,"For the $30 price, this is a great value. It is sturdy. It looks nice. So far, I'm very happy. I have had this closet for only a week, but given that the last one I bought (made by Honey-Can-Do) collapsed when I put clothes in it, I am very happy with this closet. The only thing I wish for is rolling casters on the bottom."
4,"Fast, reliable and exceptionally easy","I bought this hard drive four months ago. So far, it has worked perfectly. I just plugged in the USB cable into my Windows XP laptop and, in ten seconds, it automatically recognized everything and I had 120 gb more! It was great, so simple! I used it to backup many files from a number of computers and, every time, in ten seconds, it was perfectly working.It is also fast (8 GB in 8 minutes), and it always works without problems and without overwarming. The only small difect: it is effectively a little bit noisy, but not too much.Overall, I am very satisfied of this product."
2,Three Times as Loud as my Dell PC,"I'm really disappointed that SimpleTech couldn't find a quiet fan to keep this drive cool. Some of the other products out there don't even use a fan, just a well designed casing with ventilation. This unit hums and whirs at a somewhat high pitch, which can get quite annoying VERY quickly. I tried to hide it in a back corner of my small office, but the noise is not acceptable in my opinion. So far the drive itself works just fine and seems very quick to store and retrieve data. But the out of the box experience is SimpleDisappointing.I had previously tried out the Western Digital external USB drive, and that crashed my computer (blue screen) several times before I returned it. WD claimed I shouldn't plug it into a surge protector which seemed crazy. It was whisper quiet though. I'm tired of returing these products so I guess I'll keep it for now and look to replace it next year. Good luck on finding an external hard drive that will meet your needs."
3,Good Value,"Out of the box plug-n-play works seamlessly with my Mac. Huge backup drive. My only complaint--surface of outer shell looked a little ""scuffed up"" even though this is new. Comes with USb and firewire cables. But it works great. No frills hard drive, not much else to say."
3,I didn't buy these,"I didn't buy this item, I have several other brands and don't need one. It was placed on my review cue by mistake."
1,"Noisy Hard Drive, etc.","I should have taken the other customer reviews to heart before ordering the external hard drive and especially those reviews that described the drive as noisy, which indeed it was. So much so that I returned the item for a refund. Also I could not get the instruction manual to open from the supplied CD-ROM to complete the installation process. Simpletech's web site did not list the specific model for troubleshooting and advice. The cumulative impact of these issues causes me not to recommend this item."
1,"too slow, not like a USB 2.0","Just bought it two weeks ago to back up data on my laptop, but it runs so slowly, after I update my laptop with a USB 2.0 cardbus card, it is still slow, only copying date at about 2MB/s.it is noisy, too.Don't know why, want to return it.I bought it on buy.com, return processing is kind of hassle."
3,reasonable,"This is the 'pocket' version of the Schwartz textbook of surgery. I think this is a reasonable manual that is certainly much easier to transport than the actual textbook. However, it really doesn't fit easily into normal pockets. These days most textbooks offer on-line versions when you buy the actual textbook that can be accessed anywhere, which is probably a better option (I am not sure if Schwartz offers this with the main text, but they probably do)."
4,a bit chilly,"Although a good listen, it's surpassed a bit by the other Vintage Chill albums. Still, I will listen to it on a cold winter's day and enjoy."
1,"NO! As bad as original! Get ""Prep"" book instead.","I was SHOCKED to find it looks just like the original (by Giles a couple years ago), which had bad ratings. SOOOOO much obscure THEORY that it would take 100 lifetimes to read. And it looks like it has NO Cisco commands at all (like the orig.). I can't understand why the publishers learned NOTHING from all the complaints about the original. NO WAY would I even pay $1 for this!"
2,"Why dig a 10,000 foot hole when you only need 10 feet?","I kept hoping the author would stay focused on CCIE written materials, but time and time again, I found myself joining him on a journey into the technical details of the technical details.The fact is, if you want to pass the written, you have to study specifically for it. Why else would you be spending hours and hours reading about RIF's? There are much better topics to focus on. This book doesn't keep that in mind. It sways into territory that you just don't want to explore.I passed the Written Exam today. I can say it was hardly due to this book. I suggest the CCIE book by Swartz.I want to leave it on a good note. The text is very detailed and I will always keep it as a reference. It's obvious a lot of work was put into this book, it should just be renamed."
1,"Far cry of ""all-in-one""","I bought the original edition and didn't get through the first 100 pages before I found enough errors to cause me to return it. I waited for the lastest edition only to find there are still enough errors to make me wonder who, if anyone, reviewed the material. It is particularly frustrating when you can't even depend upon the answers to the questions being correct, let alone that many of the answers are not provided in the text. It does contain some useful information, but it is a far cry from the ""all-in-one"" CCIE study guide it claims to be."
2,"Good Information, Terrible Editing","I like this book from the perspective that it is very intense material and covers subjects a couple of different times to get you used to them. But, having said that:This is the driest book I have ever read. The subject matter is not organized well, sections and sub-sections have the same type, so you never know if you are in a thread, or starting a new subject.Did I mention the errors? If the study question were the exam, the author would pass, but probably get an 85%. There are literally that many mistakes in the answer key. I'm just glad I wasn't the only one to notice this (how could you not!)"
3,Where are you going?,This book is a good resource to assist in your studies. It lacks in some areas and dives way to deep into others. It's not a balanced attack that we all want to get the CCIE. I believe the Caslow book plus Cisco's Routing TCP/IP combined are the best 1..2..punch.
3,Good material but still needs work.,"Which certification has under 3,000 members? Which certification do many consider the hardest to get? Which certification is now covered completely in one book giving you the best chance? CCIE and the All-In-One guide is $80.00 well spent.In the 1,000 pages the author covers topics like Data Link Layer, Mac Layer Issues, 802 standards, LLC Layer issues, Bridging, NetBIOS, Appletalk, Novell, TCP/IP, RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, BGP, OSPF, Data Link Switching, ATM, Wan and Wan protocols.Extensive coverage of TCP/IP is most impressive, probably the best I have ever read or seen. Figures, tables, diagrams, actual router display code, exam questions, pictures and so much mores is included completely updated a revised work.Also included is a CD-ROM with actual router configurations for your use and review. Over 250 practice questions in both the standard and adaptive formats. While the price may seem a little high, you really can't afford to pass this one up."
5,Good choice,I really like this style. The medium is a little too small but was able to use. It is comfortable and I can wear all day.
4,Solid protection,"This is a solid knee brace its elastic so no sweaty neoprene, its good for say walking, working, but i wouldnt recomend for hard exercise or ma training but it is solid and have no complaints about it fits nice and snug but not to tight, I am sort of skinny and the Large fits perfect."
5,Helpful book,I bought this book for an agroecology class and it has really helped me understand some concepts. Plus the book explains things really well without going into erroneous detail. I have no gardening experience prior to this book but i am confident i could plant a successful garden.
5,Vegetable Gardener's Bible,"this is a great all around gardening book. Like it so well bought two more for my son in laws for Christmas, Like the Individual references to all the veggies."
5,The best vegetable gardening book I've seen,"I stumbled across this book at my local bookstore and even though I ended up paying the full retail price, it was well worth it. I knew nothing about gardening before I read the book but Ed Smith's detailed instructions and nuggets of wisdom gave me the know-how to grow vegetables that exceeded my expectations. I have an urban garden in CA (zone 9a) so I'm limited on space and have high clay content in my soil, but with three 4x6x12 raised beds I can grow fantastic organic vegetables. I've probably read the book cover to cover now several times over, but I still keep finding myself flipping to the back of the book where Ed has 1-2 pages dedicated to each of the most popular vegetables. Within these sections you can find useful information such as watering conditions, when to grow seedlings, seed longevity, most popular cultivars, and many tips for sowing, growing, and harvesting. The last part of the book alone is worth the price of the book."
5,One of the BEST Gardening books to reference,"This book is full of sustainable gardening information, from picking the garden site, to digging it up, to starting seeds, transplanting seeds, fertilzation, composting etc. It also includes garden bed pictures and graphs. The best part is that it is easy to understand and user friendly. Very comprehensive book. I am an experienced gardener but wanted to get away from the single row garden so I originally borrowed this book from the library for more information but after reading it will definately be purchasing it!"
5,Absolutely incredible information!,What an incredible person. Ed wrote an invaluable book. There is so much information and it is so detailed. He makes gardening easy. Read this book and it leaves the guess work out of managing your garden!
5,Vegetable Gardener...,I wish I would had bought this book long time ago. So much it is written out there but this book gives you a clear explanation and it is so well written.
4,This book is exactly what i expected,"I have to say,because i bought this as a gift, it was slightly embarassing that the spine of the book was ripped as if it had been dropped. The book itself is very informative and gives lots of great info. It really is a great book for anyone who is very into gardening or wants to get started.It has very reliable info."
4,gardening instruction,This is information on gardening I am glad to have. I always knew there was more than just putting plants in the dirt and waiting for it to appear as a vegetable. I have found with the right information you can grow many of the things you pay top dollar for at the grocery. I feel a bit empowered to try some new things.
4,Wonderfull Book!!!,I love the way the book is laid out so that beginners and experts can use this book. I have gleaned tons of great info from this book.
2,Meh..,"This book was pretty disappointing. It's got a lot of info, but it's all about growing in the ground, like 1900s farmers.. I'm trying to do square foot gardening and there is virtually nothing in here that can help me with that. I was expecting general veggie gardening tips, but it was lame"
2,TMI,"""Bible"" is a good word for this book because it is too much information with little explanation which means a lot of personal study time. If you’re a beginner gardener start with something much simpler, you just can’t dive off into this information and expect to understand it right off the bat. Another helpful tip is that this book is general information, it would be better to purchase info about your zone because otherwise, its just too overwhelming"
3,okay for basic radio,I installed this on my fiber glass dune buggy it works good for the basic stations but I noticed that it was having a hard time trying to keep the HD 2 & 3 stations linked on my HD radio.
5,AC/DC Power Supply Kit,This is a great little AC to DC Power Supply Kit for anyone needing regulated DC voltages. Hobbyists wanting to design and test their electronics projects will find this a very useful power supply.
4,Pretty Good,"I don't have a lot of experience soldering so I started with a couple of Elenco soldering practice kits. By the time I finished those I was convinced my soldering skills were good enough to tackle this power supply kit.All in all it took me about 4 hours total and that included lots of breaks from actual work to carefully review the instructions.Like others have said, it would have been better if the IC's were mounted on the PCB versus the heat sink. I also had a quite a bit of trouble attaching wires to the binding posts but I got it done eventually. It helps that I have small hands. Anyone with big hands could have a bit more difficulty.Curiously, I got -1.25 to -16.6 V on the negative variable output and +1.25 to +17 V on the positive variable output. Not really sure why. All other tests checked out perfectly.As long as I don't go shaking this thing like crazy I feel that it will last for a long time."
3,Not The Real Deal,"I just wanted to put something here so anyone considering purchasing this item is aware that this is NOT the actual Season 3 DVD of My Super Sweet Sixteen. This is just a BEST OF compilation of Season 3. Not only that, but it's just the second disc of a two disc set, so it only contains 4 episodes. (Amazon does sell Disc 1 as well, but separately.)This raises the question...how do I get my hands on the complete Season 3 of this show because I am not finding it here?"
3,SWEET 16/ SEASON 3,"No problems with Amazon or delivery. However, I already purchased Seasons 1 and 2, and there was a lot of repeats."
4,love this cd,heard a song on all songs considered (NPR) and decided to download the album glad i did its a great album
2,On okay lower-end priced badge,"The badges are fairly easy to work with, but they are not very durably even in an office environment. The lamenation comes apart and the peel and stick clip eventually comes off. If you only need the badges for an occasional dog and pony show, then these badges will work. If you will be wearing them every day, however, you will want to spend more and get something better."
2,Good material: Quality poor,"I liked the information but the quality of the CD was so bad that I could only listen to it on my computer. My regulard CD players did not work (car, radio/cd player, and stereo)--it just kept skipping and getting stuck. Also much of this is repeated on the other CD I purchased, Superior Male. Reading one of his books would have been a lot less frustrating."
2,Not sure about this guy,"Listened to about half of this before going down to Everett WA for a conference. Not really sure if I buy into Deida's shtick, though he's definitely a charismatic speaker. I guess if you live the Deida way you might feel more fulfilled, but then again I get a bigger kick out of old Frank Sinatra records."
3,Not easy to clean!,"I love the idea of cooking my rice in a clay pot and the rice was delicious. However, my rice cooker cooked at such a high temperature that a lot rice was burned and stuck to the bottom of the pot, and it was impossible to scrape it off. I had to soak the pot for quite a while before the stuck on rice loosened up enough to clean it and I probably threw away a cup of burnt rice. If you buy this rice cooker be sure to cook a little extra rice when you use it because you might have to throw some away when you clean the pot. Hopefully not all of these rice cookers are set to cook at such a high temperature and you will have better luck with it then I did. I had to return mine because it was defective."
1,Terrible rice cooker,"I have been eating rice since I was born. This rice cooker is the worst, very bad design. I have cooked 5 times and the rice never came out right once. The rice is half good, the other half totally wet after cooked, because moisture was strap in the cover, condensed and slid back down to the rice. This is a rice cooker which was made and designed from Chinese company, not from Japan. Stay away from this rice cooker."
5,Hilarious read!,"A light, funny read with too many close moments that were relatable!! Good for moms with young children!Highly recommend!"
3,Humorous Chic Lit,"I can't even count how many times I've been asked the question 'what do you do all day?'. It's a frustrating question for any SAHP. I think that Amy Scheibe is on the right track with her writing. For the most part I like the book. There were some parts of the book when Schiebe lost my interest, but quickly gained it back. This book was a good escape book. It was easy to pick up and put down as needed."
1,Great! If you love whining.,"There is nothing that will make the main character in this lousy book happy. She hates staying home with her kids so she goes back to work. Then she hates working because it takes her away from the little brats that she can't seem to stand being the mother of anyway. All this women does is blather on about how her life stinks, no matter what is going on at any given minute. I wanted to punch this woman in the face or better yet, give her a rope so that she could hang her miserable self and get it over with. If you want to read about a crybaby, spoiled brat, woman and her crybaby, spoiled brat family, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, just about anything is better than this crap."
4,A witty book,"Amy Scheibe's ""What Do You Do All Day?"" centered around Jennifer Bradley, a stay-at-home mom for her two children; Georgia, age four and baby Max. It was difficult for Jennifer to leave her career and her only contacts consisted mostly of other stay-at-home moms. On top of that, her husband, Thom, frequently travelled for business.There were not a whole lot of plot in this book as it dealt mostly with Jennifer staying at home, dealing with her kids' tantrums as well as their needs. This was definitely an interesting and witty book that dealt with the popular question that stay-at-home moms were frequently asked, ""What Do You Do All Day""?"
4,Almost too real to be funny,"I really enjoyed this book. It was fluffy reading -- a fast read -- which is all my mind has energy for after a day of chasing after a crawling baby. The story wasn't that great, but it was all of the little comments on motherhood that kept me reading. It's difficult for college-educated women to leave work and stay home while still feeling completely fulfilled. You miss the adult-interaction and being able to give a fancy title when you tell people what you do for a living. Our generation was raised to not be housewives, yet here we are, wanting to do the best we can for our children while taking care of ourselves.I loved that the protagonist is as conflicted as myself and every other college-educated SAHM I know. I laughed out loud in some sections, and I recommended it at my New Moms Support Group."
2,Yikes!,"This book is so far-fetched it became lame to read. I mean, really, the main character's world is just too neat, she loves herself a little too much, the children are also just so obedient. PLEASE! Where do these authors get their material?I got bored of it. And I agree with the reviewer who gave it one star - the humor isn't that great either. She's hardly witty."
3,Good for young mothers.,"Although I haven't finished this book. I really don't feel like it either. The writing is good, as is the humor. I see this book as age appropiate. Having been a professional and a stay at home mom, I look back at the younger years of child raising as a piece of cake. It's the teenager that really demand more attention and time. Although coping with young children can be stressful, humorous and downright tiring. I find I just can't relate at this stage of my life."
4,Mommies beware! She says what your really thinking!!,"As much as I liked this book, and gave it to my friends to read, I think the author could use a writing class or two. She wrote a story that I think all mommies would write. She told about all of our secret thought, desires, and she lets her character say what we all secretly want to say. The writing was very simple and undeveloped, but I still recommend it. Mommies need books like this."
4,"Good & Entertaining, but not what I expected","I enjoyed this book, and it touched on a lot of the feelings I often have as a SAHM, but it definitely wasn't what I expected. There was an entire plot that developed that I didn't expect, but it was interesting and fun. Definitely a good read, though!"
4,Great look into SAHMhood,This was a great book that really captured some of the feelings that I've had during my stint as a SAHM! I'm so happy that someone finally has acknowledge the struggles and challenges we face on a daily basis. I did however have a hard time relating to the character b/c of two main factors: I LOVE staying at home and have never once thought of returning to the working world and I joined a SAHM club when my son was 2 months old so I really never felt lonely.I have recommended this book to everyone and hope that they enjoy it!
2,Flimsy,"I admit it was a quick and entertaining read, and I enjoyed the first part of the book. Then it became pat, implausible and annoying. A better written book in Mommy lit category would be I don't know how she does it by Allison Pearson."
1,Another Alabama Rip-Off!!,"Just like the recently released CD of the same name, this DVD DOES NOT include any live material. It is a collection of 6 of their music videos which have been previously released elsewhere! Why they insist on labeling their mechandise with the ""Farewell Tour"" logo is beyond me. They should stop misleading their fans into thinking that it is actually LIVE material from their recent tour and label it for what it really is!!"
4,Alabama,"This is a great DVD even though it only has a handful of videos on it. The video and audio quality are great. Between this and the already released Alabama Greatest Video Hits DVD, there are still several videos missing. Pass It On Down, Song of the South, Tar Top, She & I, High Cotton, Angels Among Us, In The Mood, She's Got That Look In Her Eyes, & How Do You Fall In Love are just to name a few. Hopefully, this release is just to hold us over until a full Alabama Videography is released on DVD."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The American Farewell Tour consists of six videos. If you expect a concert, your as stupid as I feel. Very deceptive to call it a farewell tour, their fans got, shall we just say, ""misled""."
1,extremely disappointing,this was very disappoing...nothing here to review...not much to this video..I would not encourage anyone to purchase this
4,Exactly what I wanted,"This was a compromise, but it worked out very well. I definitely wanted a board with a ""blood groove"" all the way around it, and my wife wanted a board with a totally flat surface. this has both, so you can just turn it on the side you want. That's a big plus, in my house.I especially like the size of it. Big enough to carve a full size turkey on, yet small enough to fit in most any storage place.A very high quality cutting board, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Not as nice as I expected,"Considering how much we paid for this, and all the hype from celebs about it, I am disappointed with this product. Like a fine piece of wood furniture, I expected it to be smooth and soft to the touch. It is not. The edges are rounded but the grain is rough and it's rough around the ""handle"" grooves. Even after rubbing it down with their special protecting cream, I still wouldn't want to run my hand down it. We've just received it recently so I can't comment yet on the longevity. I also find it inconvenient that it is so large and heavy. When I'm just quickly chopping a few veggies, I still always reach for my smaller boards. They do produce one smaller board, but most of the reviews of it were very poor so I didn't bother with it. This one would be perfect if it was just cut in half (I'm actually considering having my husband do that but not sure if that would ruin the longevity?) Overall, I was expecting to be really wowed by this item and I was not."
2,Jphn Boos Cutting Board,"Item is impressive, I was going to insert into counter top as permanent piece of top, but it developed two end cracks...note I had not used but twice and carefully mineral-oiled every few weeks. Contacted Boos, and they ignored me."
1,Warped Wood is Bad,"I received two cutting boards for Christmas. The smaller one has already split and is badly warped. I hope the larger one does not suffer the same fate. Very disappointed. I had my previous cutting boards, from another manufacturer, for over 20 years without any splitting or warping."
5,Stout board,Very nice size for our kitchen. Recommed you cut out a template to ensure you order the correct size for your kitchen. Very substantial and we have cured it for 7 days. Looks great.
5,perfect for our purpose,"We have had two Boos cutting boards in our kitchen for two years and love them! I am a serious cook and there is no better board in my opinion! I finally decided I wanted a board for our RV and due to limited space we needed a dual purpose board -- one for my chopping and slicing, and one to carve cooked meat on (that would catch any juice run-off). This board was a perfect compromise! Not too big, not too small and we can easily flip it over for the appropriate purpose! Never disappointed in Boos boards and have converted many friends and family members!"
1,Don't buy a Walkblaster!,"I'm glad I didn't shell out over $70 for the DVD and 'walkblaster' incline, it's not worth it. You just tap your foot on the different colored spots on the incline, or put your foot on it and do squats, all of which can be done with just the DVD and either no incline, or with a simple, cheap step. There's not much to this video, not a very good workout aerobically, maybe I'll use it when I'm getting bored with one of the other 6 Leslie Sansone tapes I own."
1,Great Film - Lousy Soundtrack!,"This was the first mainstream Hollywood film to address gays in a non-threatening, humorous fashion. I never stopped laughing. I nearly did cry however, when I heard the soundtrack. There are two fair songs on this collection, while the rest are simply short symphonic clips from the movie. Who would buy this? What is the point? It is similiar to ""On Golden Pond"" soundtrack in this respect. Too many short witty sound bytes and not enough exhilerating music. Ouch!"
3,Do's and Don'ts,"This is a wonderful little book for people who have a friend who has lost a child but has not lost one themselves. It tells all the important do's and don'ts. One thing I would like to recommend is that you know your friend and don't take all this ""advice"" so literal. I have one friend that does not want to have other parents tell her how their children are doing in all their activities. It is still so painful for her to hear these things with it being so sudden after her son's death. Practice sensitivity and know that the pain of lossing a child is the greatest of all."
4,so worth the money,We are replacing the ceiling tiles in our basement. Initially I was using a box cutter to cut the tiles but it was time consuming and not always accurate with the type of tile we were installing. This tool made the job so much easier and definitely worth it considered it was inexpensive when looking at the time savings as well.
1,Shadowline Cutter,"I did not like the tool, but the service I got from this seller was the best or the greatest. I would buy from them agine."
5,"Brilliant, insightful, informative and thought provoking.",Peter does an outstanding job at explaining how the role of management has evolved and will continue to evolve. Each concept is followed by a anecdote which drives his point home.Take a look at the dates that some of the articles were originally published and compare it your own experiences. You'll see how insightful this man really is.His descriptions of our post-capitalist society serve to explain the many changes that organizations are experiencing. A large part of our work force has indeed evolved to the level of Knowledge Worker and will continue to do so. This shift requires a fundamental change in management.A must read for anyone who wishes to successfully manage in the next 10 years.
2,"Abstract, repetitive and dated","This is a collection of essays which theorize on business management. It is not a how-to manual for aspiring managers.While there are some interesting points scattered throughout the book it did not impress me overall. First, the essays are quite repetitive because they discuss only a few common topics. Second, the author is not a manager but an academic so the essays are rather vague, abstract and theoretical. Third, while the author gives many real-world business examples and outlines of world history, the 'analyses' are little more than rambling conjecture. Fourth, the author tries to predict the future in many of the essays, but even when he happens to be right, that future is actually Now, so the predictions are dated and irrelevant today.If you want inspiration for business management I would instead recommend autobiographies of some of the great business leaders. They often reveal the principles that made them successful."
5,Extra Credit,"If you teach business classes, have students read this book and apply it to situations. They will learn a lot! Reinforce the concepts and have them visit CGS."
2,Where's the chocolate cream?,"These candies were bought and sent as a gift to a family member who loves chocolate straws. When they were received by her, we realized that they were not ""filled"" with chocolate cream at all. There was a ""thread"" of chocolate cream in this very hard candy. Chocolate straws are crunchy and ""filled"" with chocolate. Terrible, feel embaressed that I sent them. Now as far as packaging and shipping, great! It was received when we were told it would be."
5,Great Old Timey Stuff.,I purchased these to see if they would be the same type of great candy Great Granma would keep on hand for all us kids. They were and more. Highly Recommended.
1,Poor quality,Contacted this order sender and stated that quality of product was poor and nothing would come of it - two others that had bad products immediately credit my account. To return this order would cost more than was feasible.
3,some great tales,"some great stories here. by machen, lovecraft, cram and hodgson. also an interesting one by blackwood. but basically, that's it. the non-supernatural and most of the weird fiction was completely uninteresting to me."
2,"Not as good as just plain ""Milton""","We received the original ""Milton"" as a gift and loved reading it to our child, so we ordered ""Milton Goes to the Vet"" (MGTTV). What a disappointment! The illustrations are cute but the ""story"" is not as engaging. Not that there's a ton of action in the original ""Milton,"" but it really offers a unique voice for the black-and-white hero. I thought my 2-year-old could have written MGTTV - it just didn't have the same cleverness, and Milton had lost his charming cat personality. We actually sent MGTTV back to Amazon b/c neither my husband nor I enjoyed reading it to our daughter. The original Milton, on the other hand, is a 5-star book!"
3,"Good, but not for a former meat-eater","This is probably the best vegetarian/vegan resource out there. The only problem, though is despite the books aim to be as objective as possible, it has only included about 2 or three examples of the nutrition in meat products. --In other words, if you're a meat eater and want to compare the nutrition in say, a steak against a plate of broccoli and tofu - it's not there. It seems to the authors, meat is just a deadly risky food, and they don't bother to show that it has any nutritional value whatsoever. Former meat-eaters should know what we were leaving behind."
4,Wonderful,It really brought back memories of watching Smokey Robinson and the Miracles back in the day.
2,disappointed,"most of the songs on this album i have never heard, but definitely not any that i would care to hear on other DVD's by this group. i ordered it because i wanted to exercise to Mickey's Monkey(i like that song pretty much)."
5,Excellent,Brought back the memories of the old days when musicians had talent&lyrics had real meaning. Today we have Rocjk that is ridiculous loud breaking of musical instruments&junkies screaminginto a microphone. Or Rap which is more like CRAP music where ex-cons and cons in training talk fast&curse into a microphone&brag about killing and raping and drug use. All the above proves the ENDING of America. America is a DEAD patient they forgot to bury.
4,Love Smokey more than his tenure with the Miracles,"The first time we listened to this alblum we were a bit dissapointed. I guess we are Smokey fans. We love his voice.The earlier songs on the alblum came from his days with the Miracles. It was good for us , but not great. The second half of the alblum highlighted Smokey and we really enjoyed it. Hey 25 songs for this price. Who can complain."
4,Smokin,"This is a good collection of Smokey Robinson tunes, a good Motown sound record. Smokey's voice is great. This is a long CD, over one hour, with 25 tunes, so fans will get their money's worth from this CD. For me the CD is an enjoyable listen. It's just not the genre I'm particularly into, so I gave it 4 stars. Fans of the 60s Motown stuff might consider it a 5 though. My favs:Second That EmotionTears of a ClownTracks of My Tears"
1,good film but ruined by the DVD Studio,"I have only one comment for this film which I feel should be grounds for boycotting the studio that produced it (EROS). They put their logo in the upper left hand corner at different points in the film. Really this is unacceptable and if we as consumers tolerate it, it will soon become the norm. This is a fine film but I suggest you get it some other way than from this studio."
3,Good general collection,Have tried several recipes with great success - have translated well with Australian ingredients. Love the double peanut butter crunch cookies and pistachio biscotti - nothing quite like them here in the Land of Oz! Have gotten great responses from friends and family and they sell extremely well at school fetes. Would have liked to have seen photos of finished results but the recipes are descriptive enough - excellent tips for general cookie baking included and certainly priced right!
1,Needlessy Neutered,Had hoped to see more sexual content with upbeat stories of older folks having regular sex and engaged in vigourous exercise. By and large there is just too much depressing content consistent with stereotypes. Use it or lose it? If youth only knew...and if age only could. Short on sexual success stories.
4,South Korean cinema,"This movie is for fans of the genre of Asian horror. It's got both psychological and paranormal aspects and, as is common with Asian film, it's a slow burner that takes time to develop the story line and draw you in with the characters. Once you are, you will have fun trying to tease out all the elements involved that draw you to the conclusion. I give it a 4/5."
1,"If this movie came from my country, I'd be a hikikomori too","This movie is a monumental pile of rubbish, the stinking offal of the broken dreams of better movies. The plot ammounts to nothing more than that same offal being thrown at a reel of film and whatever stuck being put into the movie. Even the subtitles suck. Thanks to this wretched movie, I'm going to become a Hikikomori now too."
4,"Great low priced TV/DVD ""big screen""","If you're looking for a larger screen in a portable LCD TV, this a great value, without even conisidering the built-in DVD. It is perfect for a kitchen or bath, and of course the dc supply is made for use in the car. It stands on a countertop or mounts to the wall with an optional mount. The DVD loads via slot, and plays great. The screen is standard format, not widescreen, so it's suitable for standard television without stretching the picture. The speakers provide a nice wide sound, not tinny like most built-ins, and are removable so you can listen via headphones. The case is custom-fitted to carry the unit as well as watch the unit without removing it from the case. I did not use the wireless headsets, but they would be ideal for the kids in the back seat or watching in bed while your partner sleeps.Bottom line: Not an HD set, but an excellent value for casual TV or movie watching in a small space or car."
5,Call of duty 3,An awesome game with fun and entertaining single player. Only problem is no co-op in multiplayer and the multiplayer is set up bad but once you get into it it you wont want to stop. The story in single player is firm and gameplay is cool.I HIGHLY!!!!! recomend this game.
3,The usual,"Not much is different with this FPS, but it's fun and the online gameplay is smooth. Tough to beat for only $30."
3,one of the best,this is one of the best on ps3 i love it online and the campaign is amazing please dont hate i just like this game but cod4 is my favorite still along with black ops
3,Average,"It's funny to me that this game is being glorified because of good graphics. It's the same tired game I have for PS2 (Call of Duty 2) with a serious graphic upgrade. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are fantastic, but the gameplay is tried and not true, and gets boring really fast. I didn't even finish it because like I said, it's the same old game."
2,poor graphics,the game is good and enjoyble but the graphics are poor it you're looking for eyecandy you'll dessapointed
1,"Call of Duty is a bunch of ""Duty""","I took a chance on buying this game and I was disappointed. First of all, I thought I would be getting a 1080i game, instead the game played at 720i (false advertisement on game cover). Also, the game made me a little nauseated, with all the moving visuals."
4,Good Game,"Good game overall, the single player missions are a little run-of-the-mill, nothing new or real exciting. I mostly play online multi-player. Fun game overall."
2,Call of Duty 3,"The game play was okay, but not the best in the world. Still like Call of Duty World at War the most out for Ps3 and Call of Duty 1 the most for PC."
2,COD 2 and 4 much better,"I enjoy the series, but this game feels like a drag compared to 2 and 4. I have a feeling this was designed for 360 and the port left something to be desired. I would like to be able to customize the controls- I like the button layout better on the 360 version of COD2 so if you have both consoles you might choose it. I replay the others and don't bother with this one."
4,call of duty 3,"the game in a whole is very fun i just wish i had the new one so that takes a lil bit out of it,other then that its great"
3,Another Great Game Ruined By Multiplayer Glitches,"Just yesterday I wrote a review for ""Resistance: Fall Of Man"" and this game falls victim to the same online issues! Most maps are open fields but on some maps I see players glitching their butts off! How are we suppose to enjoy the online multiplayer feature if the playing field is not equal ?The game is beautiful and all but that would be expected on this $ 600.00 system. If the battle field is not equal, the game is ruined. Once again, offline play is great - online play is ruined on some maps by glitchers flying over your head getting easy kills.Lastly, trying to get a multiplayer game going is a pain. I constantly get connection errors even though there is ample slots available to join a game in progress. However, when it does work - it works well! My only problem is all these weak gamers who resort to cheating and ruin a good thing!"
3,Fun...for a little while,I'm fairly new to the whole FPS genre but I am a big history buff and was excited to play this game. It was really fun at first and then became old very quickly. The missions all began to feel the same. The story was boring and the graphics were just okay. My OCD wouldn't let me move on to another game until I finished this one. I guess I also kept hoping it would get better. Nope. Even the ending of the game left something to be desired. Guess I'm happy I paid less than $10 for it on Amazon (used). I was thrilled to finally finish this game and move on. Thankfully I didn't give up on the COD WWII genre. World at War was MUCH better.
5,A Page Turner,This was one of the best Montana Mavericks books I've read. I can't wait for the series to continue. Duarte is a very talented author and does a great job explaining events of pasts books and giving hints about future books in the series.
3,Decent Historical Summary,"This book, although good in its use of terms and in its summary of Latin American History, for me personally does not do a terrific job of explaining everything that happened. This book is also difficult to read in some places, and often spends too much time dealing with a topic that in my opinion is relatively insiginficant to the history of Latin America. I used this book as a textbook for my I.B. History of the Americas course, and I do not feel like it is a good source for the Higher Level exam. If you just want a general summary of Latin American History, this is the book for you. However, for those like me who need a serious text for either a class or a test, I would find a source with more thorough notes."
3,Buena.,"Trabajando la teoría de la dependencia, los historiadores Keen y Hayes hacen un buen trabajo. Sin embargo, está muy caro."
4,Good quality historical/cultural analysis,"I needed this book for a class I was taking in college. It gives a pretty view into the world of Latin America, although I think there are better sources of material out there."
1,Not good at all,"This book is completely terrible because it is VERY VERY poorly written. Keen cannot fluidly narrate history at all. There are also frequently used high level vocab words which are unnecessarily used. The text can be very difficult to understand in some parts and in others is dictated in the passive voice which is unacceptable. It is also very dense and can be trimmed of many unnecessary facts needed for the understanding of Latin American History. Do not order this book! If you have this book throw it away, there are better ones out there including ""Born in Blood and Fire"" by Chasteen."
4,Good and Bad,"WHy this is good according to me? Because Every detailed topic had told step by step in this book. Why THis book is bad, because The examples in the book is not enough.On the other hand, you can buy this book."
1,best of Christophe,"Sorry, i know nothing about this album, because i don't knowany title. I don't buy a cd when i don't know the titles. Wy i'm gonna buy it? This is the reason why i wrote to you!How many persons do you think,they gonna buy it? How many songs?Which songs? Sorry mayby, you can tell me,what i want to know, and see later,for now it's really impossible to make a guess or rating that cd.Sorry."
1,This Program STINKS!,I bought this video to enjoy my home state of in 1080i HD. But the producers focused on Las Vegas alone! The producers obviously thought there wasn't anything outside of Clark County worth talking about! Don't waste your money on this worthless program!
2,Dreaming Nevada,"Living in the areas covered by this video, I bought it since I've yet to visit any of the scenic spots nearby, and after being here 7 years I doubt I ever will see these places. I thought ""Dreaming Nevada"" would be a good substitute. The photography was beautiful, a bit heavily saturated with color, but impressive. Running time is listed in Amazon's description as 52 minutes, somehow I have to find about 32 of those minutes as I seemed to only get about 20 minutes of play out of it. It's a nice DVD overall, but a bit expensive, I think, for what it delivered, appealing to a very limited audience."
2,Dreaming Nevada - Not much to dream about!,"Some great footage on this DVD, but unfortunately you are just getting into the beauty of Nevada when the DVD finishes. Much too brief IMHO.I purchased this at a reduced price, wouldn't have been very happy if I had paid full retail."
3,HD DVD moyen,Les couleurs ne sont pas toujours naturelles et le DVD est trop court; 20 minutes de vidéo seulement!
3,Not what I expected,"I love Nevada. I like to visit there as much as possible and I know a lot about the state having grown up there. I was hoping this was an HD documentary and would show highlights of the state. Instead, it is ONLY about the Las Vegas area! Another fault is that there is NO commentary whatsoever. The video quality is very good which is why I gave it three stars. A shame, as something more than ambient music, i.e. a narration, would have added immensely to the enjoyment of this presentation."
2,"Nice, but not full HD","Those looking for a demonstration disc to show off their new 1080p resolution projector or large screen flat panel should look elsewhere. The credits at the end say it was shot in ""High Definition 1080 x 720."" Unfortunately, 1080 x 720 is not an HD format. They may have meant 1280x720. But in any event, it is not full 1920x1080 resolution, as most HD DVD movies and demo discs are. So this disc will probably look great on a 42"" plasma TV, but if you blow it up to 100"" or larger, it will look a bit fuzzy compared to other HD DVD materials you may be used to seeing.Other than the compromise in HD video quality, the disc is a pleasant collection of helicopter views over Red Rock Canyon, Valley of Fire, Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, and of course Las Vegas. It is nicely edited and compiled. I just wish it were full high definition. I would not have purchased it had I known this ahead of time."
4,Works Great,I didn't have any trouble feeding this paper thru my HP Photosmart C4795 printer. The surface is matte so I'll probably laminate it for shine. Very happy with the price!
3,It's not very useful,"It's fine being a magnet by itself, but cannot hold heavier paper (such as a postcard) against the other surface like the fridge."
3,Not very strong,"I found the magnetic strength of these sheets to be lacking. When cut into smaller pieces, about 1/4 of a sheet, they could hardly hold up a piece of paper on the fridge. Any smaller than that and they were lucky to stick to the fridge at all. The printing quality was decent. Had to feed them individually, which was expected. Also easy to cut with normal scissors."
1,Save your money,These magnetic sheets from Avery are worthless. I used them to attach a bumper sticker on my car. In less than a week they were curled and lifting at the corners. In my opinion they are too thin.I will not recommend them for the application that I tried them for.
1,Not a strong magnet,Tried to use a strip cut from one of the sheets and it will not stick to my refrigerator I really don't know know how you would use these .
2,"Not very impressed, pretty flimsy, weak magnet","These are OK, and the print quality onto them was acceptable, it's just that, well, like my title says, I'm not very impressed, the sheets are pretty flimsy and the magnet is weak."
3,Weak magnet,"The magnetism on the sheets is very weak, barely sufficient for sticking on the refrigerator. I wanted the magnet for another purpose, and it won't work for that."
1,Thin and Weak,"Barely strong enough to hold themselves onto a refrigerator. If they get a little bent, they fall off all the time. Can't be used to hold photos or paper up. Too thin."
4,Pleased with purchase,I am pleased with purchase of magnet sheets use to make church magnets to give to visitors. Fit in my Canon Printer great and printed fine. Would recommend.
2,Not as expected for Save the Dates,"I had purchased this product for Save the Dates and I am returning the rest of the packets. It says they are ""matte coated for vivid color and photo printing"" and I completely disagree. I feel like it is the same as printing on a regular sheet of printer paper... I would definitely not use for photos. The design I printed was flowers and navy colored words over white background and when printed the edges of the ink were not smooth and looked almost like they were bleeding into the white background. Also, the ink bleeds as it would on regular printer paper. I do not recommend this product for Save the Dates, I would only recommend it for printing notes or important information you want on your fridge, but then again, the info might smear."
2,disappointed,sheets were too thin and magnets were weak so they did not work well for what i wanted - to make magnet dolls for my kids.
1,This product is garbage,"Please don't waste your money on these things; they are completely worthless. They don't have even enough strength to hold their own weight so if you intend to create magnets to be used for their intended purpose, to hold things up, this is not the product for you. I can't speak to how they look when printed upon because I didn't even get that far. If I could have given this product negative stars, I would have."
3,Magnet Sheets,"They seem to only work on appliances, but not for outdoor or on vehicles. But I'm able to still use them for whatever I can. Thank you."
1,Not for use on a automobile!,"They are literately pieces of paper stuck to a very thing magnet.They will not stick to an automobile at all, and the stick to a refrigerator is not very good either."
2,Magnets not strong enough,"I was intending to use this in my crafting, but the magnets are not strong enough. Not keeping. This is the first Avery product that I haven't been satisfied with."
2,These are fun! But...,"I don't use them for any heavy items I need to hold on the fridge. I just like making magnets for a good time, and as another reviewer mentioned, they make excellent ""save the date"" magnets. I like to make fun commemorative magnets for friends and family, and everyone loves them. The are very flimsy and weak, though. The last pack I ordered started curling the next day.Also, the only store in my town that carried them was an office supply store, and they were exactly twice the cost of these with my free shipping."
2,For a price is Cheap,Looks good but the edges will not stick into the surface. Trying to stick it to my car but the edges will not stick to the surface.
3,Magnet Sheets,"These sheets work okay, but I do wish they were a little thicker. They work well to print on, though."
4,inkjet magnets,"The end result is good, but sometimes they jam in the printer, and sometimes curl a bit. They could be easier to workwith if they were just slightly thinner I think."
3,Okay,"These are very thin, I guess to go through a printer. They seem to work for the purpose I wanted when attached to some card."
1,No good...Staples brand WAY better,"I bought these and was very disappointed. The finish is like printing pictures on regular copy paper...quality is severely lacking. In addition, they stick ok to sheet metal, but not as well to finished surfaces like refrigerators.Another comment mentioned Staples brand magnet sheets and they are far superior. They stick better and have a glossy, photo paper like finish. However, they do cost more...4 sheets for 10 dollars at my local store. IMO, well worth it because the picture/print quality was a hundred times better. Avery ended up being a waste of money because once I printed on the Staples brand, I threw out all the Avery prints."
1,These are terrible!,"I purchased these for storing my Spellbinders cutting dies. I thought I could save some money by buying these and cutting them to the size I required rather than buying the magnetic sheet offered with the storage system I did buy...what a waste of money!Although there were a couple of bad reviews (which can always be expected with any product), most were quite positive...I am VERY disappointed. One reviewer said these sheets would not support themselves...they are right! They are more flimsy than cheap, lightweight cardstock! In fact, they buckle under their own weight.I put these sheets in a clear plastic sleeve in a binder with my spellbinders dies (not really) stuck to them. My dies don't stay in place when I flip through the pages! Now, I am going to buck up and buy the magnetic sheets I should have bought originally!"
3,Works ok...,"I bought these to print out pictures, cut them up into puzzle pieces, and place them on a magnetic rectangle so they can be rearranged into the right places. The magnet they are placed on is pretty substantial (at least the thickness of all 5 sheets of this paper), and the puzzle pieces stick fine when the whole thing is lying on a table, but when I lift it up sometimes the pieces fall off!I tried sticking a piece on my fridge and it wouldn't stay--and the packaging says it will stick AND hold up a piece of paper on most metal surfaces. I couldn't get it to stick at all! And the magnetic paper just stuck on a good magnet doesn't even stay very well when it's lifted off the table so that gravity is affecting the pieces. Overall, it works fine for my purposes because the puzzles are meant to stay on a table, but I just can't see any use for them beyond that."
4,product received not as ordered,"I did not receive Avery Magnet sheets as advertised. Instead of 5 sheets of Avery Magnets, I received 16 sheets of another brand. They did work well. I WAS OFFERED A REFUND IF NOT SATISFIED. I chose to keep them. If I were to order again, I would contact the company and ask if I was going to recieve what was advertised or a similar product."
3,just ok,"This book had some good quotes, but it was only ok. There were many odd, not great quotes. I expected more."
1,Makit Products Inc.,"Makit Products Inc. - This once fine company has gone down hill fast since Robert Lignon of Houston, Texas bought the company a few years back. He fired key managers, ripped off suppliers and customers He has run the company down as he will do almost anything for a buck. See their D&B credit rating, it isn't good. Can't recommend Makit Products Inc. There are other companies that offer this make a plate service."
3,A Pretty Good Semi-Autobiography,"Hmm... Not bad. On the whole, this is how I would review this book. Torres' nostalgic trip down '80's lane makes a great companion piece to his present adult dilemma wherein he tries to make ends meet as a writer. The story recalls a time when Star Wars rocked, hair was big (and bad), and writing stories are fun and timeless. This was indeed a story about storytelling, and I suggest any aspiring writer to pick this up and give a good listen to your raging past; a past bursting with story. My only criticism about this book is that at times it could be a bit dragging. Especially at the end, where it all feels so open-ended and unsatisfying as a book. It didn't exactly give me the great accomplishment feeling when reading a book with a good ending (like WATCHMEN or even BOX OFFICE POISON). Otherwise, it's not bad."
4,people and times of Valazquez,The narrative throughout the book is overwhelming with details of the life and times of Valazquez. I expected more paintings by this master but was surprised to find too many details of his relationships to others in the ruling class as well as other relationships that were too detailed for me.I expected more details of his techniques and his approachas as he grew and matured into his supreme ability to render reality as he saw it.
5,Worked as expected,Bought this to replace another cable that I found out was a charging-only cable. This cable is a data cable and worked great.
5,i never thought i would hear smokey again,"the tracks of my tears is only second to me to i'll walk the waterfront oh and porgy. i mean, maybe not second to, but i adore this music. i just left it in my childhood as 45s and 33s and goodbye to all that. how delightful to rediscover it. great great stuff."
2,"Subject is interesting; The storytelling, not very.","Although the subject matter is very interestng, the storytelling lacked warmth and real soul revealing information.I actually thought the afterword by the husband was much more interesting and perhaps more helpful to unfaithful spouses.I think it boils down to Suzy coming off as being so good, who could believe this is a real person. You know, ""My biggest fault is I am too ...faithful, smart, organized"" that you would use in an interview to capture a job."
1,"minus five stars, actually",I find it fascinating that this woman continutes on her path of self-agrandizement and the disparagement of others....... This is nothing new as I knew her at Kingswood and she was the same then as she is now. I found her book a total waste of time and a total embarassment for her sons. I wonder how she likes being the subject of ridicule now as she has so often tried to do to others.
1,Two thumbs down,"Am I the only one who has noticed that if a negative review is left there is a onslaught of reviews that attack the negative ones? We are entitled to our opinions and without a doubt the ones coming to Suzy's rescue here are either her friends (?), on her payroll, or hey, maybe it's Suzy herself leaving the glowing reviews. Face it, this book is weak. I was very disappointed.Read it at the library if you can stomach it,but don't spend your cash on it. Suzy put this out there for everyone to read, now she needs to take the good with the bad. Not everyone is going to come to her rescue. I watched the Oprah episode with Suzy and her family and thought she held herself with dignity and grace, I was mortified for their sons to put them up for public display like that, I hated the book."
1,what a wimp !!!!,"After seeing the oprah show I couldn't wait to read this book ! It's like a fairy tale version of infidelity .Where's the real pain ? Where's the rage most women feel after this kind of betrayal ? Suzy is one giant wimp ! She looked the other way for years so as not to ruin her life style .I'd work on the marriage but first Burton would be on the couch for months and his riding clothes would probably be shredded .He's also understand that if he ever so much as thought about cheating again his belongings would be on the lawn and the locks would be changed .Suzy ""s book has about as much emotion in it as flat ginger ale .Maybe sometime she'll write a real book about the betrayal .Complete with spending days in bed crying ,screaming at Burton until she was hoarse and opening his mail to make sure this is not happening again .That's reality to most women who have dealt with infidelity .Not this fairytale !!!"
3,More specific advice needed,"Suzy's book does tell a moving story of an all too familiar story of infidelity and perhaps of sex addiction. Unfortunately, the book gives few specifics that can be helpful to readers who need more support than just their story retold in print. Some may have been seeking the book by Dr. Jennifer Schneider with same title Back From Betrayal. Dr. Schneider's Back From Betryal offers a user friendly guide through the very painful and difficult ordeal of infidelity, many practical tips for self care, support in communities when one has few financial resources, and ways to rebuild trust in oneself and the relationship. Both books would help anyone trying to survive the betrayal of infidelity."
1,Back from Boredom,"I was so excited to read this book... If Oprah thought it worthy of her show, surely it would help me through my situation. When I read a book life stops until I finish it. With this book, it was easy to put down. Suzy took more time to describe how the room was decorated, than she did on the crisis of her marriage. It read like a novel, a boring novel. It's hard to feel sorry for this couple when she never really let you get a glimpse into the true pain.For those of you seeking comfort from someone who has survived the PAINFUL aftermath of an affair, I wouldn't look in this book. It was very difficult for me to relate to Suzy's pain (she never really expressed it)."
3,Great for die hard fans,"Many argue that Bowie was at his creative peak with the Berlin trilogy (Low, Heroes, Dodger). This low-tech DVD examines the albums in depth, mostly with dry interviews about the circumstances around the albums.There's little in the way of old video and the sound is mediocre. It's mostly voiceovers with slow shots of album covers and academic style interviews with unfamiliar people.There is some interesing content. For example, who knew V2 Schneider was an ode to Kraftwerk?Sometimes it's hard to know where Bowie is coming from. The DVD clears up some of his motivations and has some interesting details about his life and music creation process.However, overall it's dull. If you love the Berlin trilogy and want to learn about Bowie in a dry, mildly academic way then this is the disc for you.If you want a movie that rocks with tons of classic video then look elsewhere."

2,Poor Filtration,The filter would have been perfectly fine if it were not for the exception that there was no sealing surface. I had to add weather striping to the outer edge to provide sealing. I could only assume that these are reject parts. May be vendor dependent
1,Doesn't replace 43611042,This filter is a panel-type filter. Hoover part number 43611042 is a cylindrical filter. Don't buy this filter if you need part number 43611042; go to google and check there (for instance http://www.google.com/search?q=43611042+hepa&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official).
2,Great Western TV Shows Review,"I understand that these are very old shows and, no doubt, were not preserved well, but I think that this should be pointed out in your advertising. It is disappointing when you expect the same quality that you remember and the picture is distorted, faded (almost bleached) and has poor sound. If this is acknowledged first, it would minimize the quality expectations. Old fans would still purchase the product.Derald Blackmore"

5,Will wake up the sleeping heart,"This relatively short treatise of Imam 'Alawi al-Haddad is a piercing reminder of where we are and where we are going. This book is both enlightening and terrifying (in a good way). The Shaykh guides us from the time before our conception all the way to our endpoint in the fire or the garden and reminds us of what is important in each phase of our life and what our responsibilities are.This book is not indepth in its topics, but that is not its point. If you want to study every hadith about the judgment day for example then you can do that somewhere else. A brief outline is given of every stage, both the seen and the unseen, to give a basic view of what has and is going to occur, but the focus is on the spiritual and what we can do to change our state.If you have a heart that is not dead this book will have a positive effect on you."
2,so sad,"This has got to be one of the saddest albums I've ever listened to and coming from Montell Jordan it was even more of a disappiointment. It seems he will not be reaching the heights of ""This is how we do it"" anytime soon."
4,Montell Proves There's Life After Def,"I've been a Montell Jordan fan since he debuted with ""This Is How We Do It"". He latest CD ""Life After Def"" is just as good as his previous work. With each CD Montell continues to shows his growth as an artist.When I first heard the single ""Supa Star"" I had to get ""Life After Def"" - I'm not disappointed. I like every track with the exception of the bonus ""We Ride Dem Thangs"". Along with the first single, some of my favorites include ""Aight"" (flirty club song), ""Questions"" (explanation of what's happened in his life), ""What If I Never"" (romance), and ""Yes"" featuring Tonex (inspiration). For R & B fans, this CD has a good balance of high energy and slow jams."
5,A Kind Of Magic,One word. Magic! Just a joy to read. It is not just a sc/fi novel. Works on a lot of different levels. Would appeal to just about any reader of any genre. It's bright. Clever. Interesting and a darn good yarn told rather well. It definatly gets a top ten place in my all time greats.
4,Educational Lecture,"Educational video targeted at exercise & health professionals. It is a fairly tecnical lecture on the multiple health benefits of & advice related to resistance exercise in elderly. The lecture is follows a series of information slides; there are no actual exercises demonstrated (i.e. this is not a ""workout video"")."
5,Excellent,"This downloadable series is great, I especially love the easy access. The video is very clear as well as the audio . I purchased both seasons and wait for the others.I will definitely recommend this videoVery Please in Brooklyn, NY"
2,Gruesome but nice shots of London,Maybe I'm a bit squeamish or I've lived in the US too long but I find the subject matter too harrowing to watch with the sound on. Also the story line is a bit contrived.
3,"There's good news, and there's bad news.","The good news is that Idris Elba was rewarded for his performance in ""The Wire"" with his own series. The bad news is that David Simon was not involved in this production. And that is a very diplomatic way of putting things.""Luther"" is a production of BBC America. But with production values, casting and acting that far exceed its writing, there is a lot more America than BBC in it. (SPOLIER ALERT!) What, for example, would a series be without a serial killer? We meet Luther's in Episode One. A smart, attractive young lady who - ta-da! - has a thing for Luther, and against whom he fails to make a case, thus insuring her presence in subsequent episodes. The plot never recovers - nor seriously tries to recover - from the implausibility of this. And why, judging from the glowing reviews, should the writers have made the effort?"
4,Awesome Show,"If you're fan of Idris Elba, then you'll love this series. It's very well scripted, it's got great characters and great actors. Don't miss this."
5,Finally a crime drama where the black guy doesn't get killed first.,"Great series, I'm looking forward to season two. Not only is the a very well written, directed and acted show it flips the typical Hollywood formula on it's head. Finally something on the screen with a black lead where he is not:A bumbling, fumbling idiotA side kick to a white guy to make the white guy more likableA cross dressed minstrel characterA great breath of fresh air. Thank you BBC. I'm hoping this show doesn't get canceled."
3,Won't be watching this show,"I loved Idris Elba in The Wire. In this show, however, the conversation appeared very contrived. Plus, the constant music/noise telling you how you should feel was a bit too much."
2,Not worth the time...,"I like Elba, but this show is not worth the time spent watching. Hopefully he'll have better scripts in the future.."
3,Well written entry in series,"As with all books in TOR's ""Conan"" series, any resemblance the main character has to Robert E. Howard's creation is purely coincidental. Despite that, however, this is a well-crafted sword & sorcery novel about a warrior whose mercenary band is betrayed by their employer. The band then strikes back against the traitor's army and pet wizard.The main problem with the book is the climax of the story. *** SPOILER *** Like many entries in this series, the author sets up a wizard as the main threat to Conan's plans and then builds towards Conan destroying the character. Unfortunately, Conan screws up only to be saved by a magical creature with little connection to the rest of the story.A good read if you like this series, though."
3,"Great looking, not very well made","We've played with these dozens of times. They work, they're fun but not sturdy. The boards bounce everytime a bag lands on it. The bottom posts holding the boards up move and fall often and are starting to chip. They're much nicer than the plastic and function well, just not the nicest. The labels and everything on the board look very cool. I would recommend these but not to a die hard cornhole player!"
3,Decent Boards,I love the boards. Being an avid Buckeyes fan the boards and design is amazing. The bags that were sent were ok looking but filled with sand that was in plastic bags. The box also stated string and instructions were included but nethier were present. One bag broke after 2 games I contacted the seller about the missing items and seperatly on the Broken bag. Was pretty much told they know nothing about the products they sell and there wharehouse eithe CANT READ or didnt bother to check the contents that should be in each box. This is not to much of a concern but the amount of time between replies from the seller was RIDICULOUS. I still dont have a response about the bag even though it is probably not going to be replaced. all in all for the price I would buy the boards again and trash everything else. I am getting these Set of 8 Regulation Cornhole Bags by BestCornBags
3,for the new gambler,This video will teach you the very basics of gambling nothing more. If you're new to gambling and want to learn the basics of the game this video can help you. But if you're an experienced gambling don't waste your time watching this video.
5,It Does Not Get Any Better Than This,"A long time fan of Ms. Crawford, I jumped at the chance to own a compilation of her songs. I listen to this CD practically every day. I listen to it when I am on the railroad; when I am relaxing; when I am doing things; on my way to resting at night. This CD takes me places that my soul needs to go at times and then brings me back. Thank you Ms. Crawford for having become a singer."
3,"Best of Collection falls short, though comprehensive.","What I the about Best of collections is that there are always hits that are left off. In this case ""Wrap U Up"" and ""I Don't Feel Much Like Crying"" are left off. Both made the top 20 on the R&B charts. Also, there are contributions from some of Randy's best cds that re also missing. Try ""Secret Combination,"" ""Windsong,"", ""Nightline,"" and her cd full of covers including the excellet ""Forget Me Nots"" and ""Come Into My Life."""
3,Not easy for beginner,I am a first time tent buyer and the directions that come with this are a lot less than a beginner needs. I tried for an hour to figure out how to put this tent up and still have not been able to. You definately need at least 2 adults and someone who has knowledge of putting tents up as the directions are very brief. I have not yet used it so I cannot atest to its durability.
5,Wenzel Tent,This was a gift for our son and he was impressed! It is made very well and the price was an added bonus. It rained and the tent did not leak and was amazingly large and roomy inside.
1,The 10 Year warranty sucks,"We received this tent This week, we set the tent up on Wed. come Thursday the tabs that hold the steaks where tearing and one riped a hole in the tent so I called to check on the warranty since the tent had only been up for 12 HOURS well they told me that I would have to sent the tent back to them WITH MY MONEY and if they seen that it was a defalt in the tent and not done by wind that they would replace it... 12 HOURS IS ALL THAT IT TOOK FOR THIS TO HAPPEN... So if you bought this tent because of the warranty then you got a bad deal..."

5,best 311 album,"311 has always been one of my favorate bands and this has to be there best work. the standout tracks of this cd are ''Transistor'', ''Electricity'', ''Beautiful Disaster''a must get for any 311 fan or any music fan looking for something fresh and new"
3,Liked the commentaries of a few in the series...,"Unfortunately, the show is a bit lacking in direction. Many who've read the manga knows that this has been the regular deal for the most.. but."
5,The Remixes Are Da Bomb,Irv Gotti Presents the Remixes Album Is So Cool That All The Murder I.N.C Crew Is On The Album And I Was The 50 Person At Tower Records To Get The Album And It Was Sold Out After About 10 person And I had Just Made It I Want After School To Go Get It And I Got So I Would Tell You Buy This Album Becuse It Is Da Bomb And It Rocks Da House Becuse It's Murder Baby
1,The remixes are full of Overplayed songs I don't care bout,"This CD is full of old news, after hearing the regular songs of the remixes ova and ova again, this CD wasn't worth the 16 bucks I spent on it. The inc's Ego has gotten outta control, and they startin' to realese one album after another, thinking they gettin bigger and bigger. Well they been gettain' wacker wacker and wacker. If I were u, later 4 dis and git Pac's better days or the murderers fist album than this garbage. Irv Gotti, think of something better than something that Any rap artist can do in 1 day"
5,A great Christmas story.,"This book could become a Christmas tradition. It's a wonderful story of love, sacrifice and giving. A good read for friends and family."
5,Another gem from Chumbawamba,"The packaging of the DVD with the Readymades LP makes for a perfect match. The original album was very strong, the DVD is very entertaining. Recommended for the Chumbawamba fan."
5,"If you're a fan, this must be in your collection!","Johnny is a great balladeer. I had to have this in my collection. It's all of my favorites on one CD. My all-time favorite is ""Quiet Time to Play"" and it is hard to pick out a favorite."
5,homeboy,"I've love J.G. since half crazy nobody knows about this song i wish i can get my hands on a copy of this song or the cd. In my book J.G. will always be #1, also i'am from D.C. he went to Sousa jr. high and i went to Eloit jr. high then J.G. went to Duke E."
2,Kathy M.,"I rate this book only ""average"" for a CLEP preparation text. I purchased the new edition, and compared it to a 1995 edition, and found the two versions to be almost identical -- with few updates. However, I did find the CLEP Preparation for the General Exams to be much more thorough than this text, and would strongly recommend purchasing that preparation guide, rather than this edition -- if you want to pass the Humanities Exam."
2,Not enough information to study for the exam.,"I used this book to study for the General Humanities test and found most of the information was NOT on the test. Only a few questions pertained to information covered in the book.The art portion was totally useless. None of the artists or paintings/sculptures that were on the test appeared in this book.The text went over in great detail literature - specifically poetry, and I did not have any questions on the exam that pertained to this information either."
4,GOT TO HAVE,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOK. IT GAVE ME A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TEXT AND EXAM. THIS BOOK, WITH SOME ELBOW GREASE MADE STUDYING A POSSITIVE EXPERENCE. IT USED CLEAR AND EVERYDAY WORDS, WHICH I FOUND VERY HELPFUL. IF U R TAKING THIS TEST, GET THE BOOK."
3,Humanities,"Delivery was slow, but within time promised. Book is ok..purchased as a quick review. It covers the basics but is an older published book so I wonder how applicable the information will be on the actual test. Overall, good value. Easy to read."
4,o'brien's brutal grace,"to explore the depths of desperation, john o'brien didn't have to look far beyond the bottle he was selling himself to; and in so doing, he linked himself with the only profession that requires selling yourself: prostitution. by joining a prostitute whose lost the capability to delude herself and an alcoholic whose done the same, o'brien made it impossible to write a book where any second of loftiness, fantasy, or anything less than pure gutsy wriing would have immediately destroyed the book. o'brien pulls it off masterfully; he never pulls any punches and manages to be endearing and hopeful at the same time. any writer whose emotional climax involves one of the characters ""masterbating furiously"" and can still make the moment tender and beautiful deserves an immense amount of credit."
3,The book overcomes its shortcomings,"John O'Brien wasn't a strong writer, and he frequently loses control of this narrative. For example, he does strange things like assumes the point of view of a refrigerator ... but doesn't do anything with that. He's not really in control of his language, either -- grabbing words that seem out of context, e.g., ""redolent of his prescience"" instead of a straightforward ""suggestive of his foresight,"" which would've fit better with his own rhetorical choices earlier in the novel. Some of the sex scenes with Sera also seem to betray a sexual aggression on the part of the narrator, which is weirdly blind for this narrator considering just how omniscient this narrator is in other places ... Nonetheless, these flaws may make the story easier to take. A perfect execution of this story may have been too dark. Instead, the flaws humanize the story (which is powerful) and the characters and make it a compelling read."
1,Elizabeth Shue - the only reason to see the movie -,"Love story? Hardly. This is a horrible, seedy novel glamorizing prostitution and alcoholism. Gosh, aren't protitutes and alcoholics so wonderful and clever? Graphic, grotesque sex, language, violence and totally unbelievable characters make it a sad, depressing story with no redeeming qualities for the characters or the novel. Will you be depressed after reading it - yes. Does that make it romantic or wonderful or even worth reading? No.I enjoyed the movie which was saved by the good looks and acting of Elizabeth Shue - at least in the movie one feels a smidgeon of sympathy for the characters as unrealistic as they are - sorry but alcoholics on the verge of death don't look like Cage. Only Hollywood could glamorize such tripe.One has to wonder about the author's state of mind who would write such trashy crap - and then again it's really no wonder to hear what ultimately became of him."
3,Not Live,"The cd itself does not say live, BUT, it IS advertised that way and the copy I bought, did have the additional sticker on the front that DID advertise it as LIVE. Good collection from a great band, but if you're a fan, you've probably got every single song on here, and were disappointed that it was not indeed live... Pretty shady marketing... probably no fault of the group, but still deceptive...."
1,Another Record Company Trick,"I was all excited when I heard about this release. I *thought* it was going to be a live recording of songs culled from their Farewell Tour. There is certainly no reason to believe otherwise from the title of the album. However, when I get to the store to purchase it, it had a large sticker on the front cover ""contains studio versions of songs Alabama is performing on their farewell tour."" What kind of garbage is that? How many compilations has this band put out?If I sound angry about this, it is because, plenty of people will order this from Amazon and other online CD stores and not know that they are getting the same studio versions that have been rehashed over and over again. I have lost all respect for this band and am glad they are hanging it up. Why would they call what is essentially another greatest hits album ""Farewell Tour?""Buyer beware. If you are looking for a decent hits package, get ""For the Record."" You get twice as many songs."
5,you are all wrong!,You are all wrong. It doesnt say it is a LIVE CD anywhere on the cd so why would you think it was LIVE. This isnt Alabama's fault. blame it on your teachers that were supposed to teach you to read. if you want to keep bashing the greatest country group ever then go ahead but they wont miss you bc you are not real fans.
1,UPSET,"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE THINKING OF RCA. FOR THE RECORD IS NUMBER ONE BECAUSE IT IS LIVE ALABAMA. IT IS NOT THE BOY'S FAULT THAT THIS HAPPENED. SOMEHOW, ALABAMA NEEDS TO REACH OUT TO THE FANS WITH A LIVE TV, CD OR DVD. THIS TOUR WAS HANDLED TOTALLY BY RCA. THEY SHOULD HAVE NOT STARTED THE CONCERTS AT 8:00 SINCE THEY HAVE SO MUCH MUSIC. THEY NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR THE FANS."
2,NOT MY FAVORITE,I chose this rating because the product does not work as good as the similar product I have ordered from the United Kingdom. I wanted a similar product to order here in the United States. This is the third similar I have tried but I always go back and order from the United Kingdom. Their product is much more effective in not letting garments move regardless of how much is applied. This Mediven Product does not last effectively throughout a day.
5,How the Record Store gets your Money,"I did not intend to buy this cd.I merely walked into a record store and decided I'd take advantage of their cd players that they allow customers to use for previewing purposes. I had already bought a cd that day, and I was certainly not going to buy another so soon. I put the head phones on, and was instantly blown away under 20 seconds. Jaw dropped, eyes full open, scrambling to check the interior of my wallet.2 minutes later I bought this cd.This is an excellent CD. A complete classic.Its probably not very accessable, but if you are a fan of Four tet, or Manitoba, you might find this a natural extension. I'm blown away.Damn you record store!!!"
3,Some great pages,"3 1/2Still a singularly spellbinding work of creative glitchtronica, this promising offering from the low key act may not have been the marker to take Books over the top as initially expected, but adeptly provides acoustic and sampled orchestrations to stimulating effect regardless, even if the approach does loose steam on its second side."
5,What Sounds Atonal At First Becomes Music To Your Ears,"The Books are a very delightful oddity, to many atonal garbage and to a collective few ingenious music. The Lemon of Pink is quite possibly one of my favorite albums available in the ever growing experimental/bizarre music field.Honestly I don't want people seeing a five star review and thinking It's worth purchasing as many will not appreciate. With a open mind and a few listens at that one can easily pull together the imagery this album lays. For the open minded people as many reviewers on here have noted, it is easily a great buy and a strong investment into ones collection.Clashing sounds and acoustic arrangements coupled with breaks for speech covers the turf here. The quality is great very crisp and worth mentioning. The Books have a modern classic at hands here!"
5,Uncategorizable,"If computer mixing and glitch techno had been around in the early days of folk, it might sound something like this."
4,Fun for all ages,"My 6 year old and I love to do art with these crayon-like pastels. Fun, easy, produces good pictures, feels more special then using crayons or markers."
5,Great !!,I was ready to purchase the expensive French dutch oven. I heard good things about the Lodge and took a chance and got it for about 1/2 the price of the other brand. I am 100% happy with it. It is ultra heavy and really a great looking piece of cookware.
5,Great and beautiful,"We researched which dutch oven was the best choice for us and are SO glad we chose this one ... Sturdy, beautiful ... the handle adds such grace ... design and function ... wow."
4,Solid reference,Solid reference for both beginners and experienced readers. Author provides great synonyms for readers from various backgrounds.
3,a little thin,"It is fine, but not chock full of anything new. Does give some useful ideas, that get the brain firing"
2,just ok,"I'm tired of Kayne West. He ain't that good Musically. a few alright cuts,but not worth no 8 grammy Nominations. this song is alright. true story about Gold Diggers which means it will never end sad to say,but this song is just alright. Jamie Foxx on the Hook still eating off Ray charles's plate.time for Jamie Foxx to get some new Dishes or get some Dixie paper Cups&Plates.Brother Man is wearing out Ray Charles's Plates,Knives,Forks,Spoons&paper towels with still mimicking him. I dug the Movie ""Ray"" but this is getting Old.He does it again for Luda for ""Georgia"". but anyway this song is just aight at best."
4,Kick Ass!,"Folks, I love Cracker. And I love alt-country music, like the recently disappeared Americana channel on DirecTV. Damn them! Why does all the good stuff disappear, while Rap and Easy Listening lives on forever? I dunno.Nevertheless, while Cracker is being seriously ironic, the music still kicks ass. Especially after four or five drinks. The only reason they don't get five stars for this disk is that they don't have ""Okie From Muskogee"" on the CD itself, only on the video, and then only part of it. Sorry, guys. It takes ""Okie From Muskogee"" to get five stars. ""Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down"" and ""Up Against The Wall Redneck Mothers"" is only worth four stars.But I loved ""It Ain't Gonna Suck Itself"" which is probably worth an extra 1/2 star, so we'll give you 4-1/2."
4,Classic Cracker But Not Really Country,"If you're a Cracker fan buy this record. It's got lots of tongue in cheek lyrics, up-tempo catchy tunes and classic Cracker wit. Perhaps the only negative is the length. Nine tracks is short even by old-school standards (I haven't yet watched the Ironic Mullets Quicktime - maybe this makes up for it).I'm a little confused because aside from the title, this album is no more ""country"" than anything else Cracker has produced. True, they cover and twist the lyrics around on a couple of country classics like ""Up Against the Wall Redneck Mothers"" and ""Family Tradition,"" but the Countrysides renditions don't sound anymore country than say ""Sweet Thistle Pie"" or ""Dixie Babylon"" off the Golden Age album.Buy this album because Cracker is a fantastic, underrated band that more people should enjoy. Just don't expect Hank Williams Jr. to look down with approval when you hit play."
5,"Could of been more twisted, but tasty nonetheless","As alt country goes, this is near the top. A forgotten band (by radio and sales standards) doing what they want without a label putting their hands in the pot. In conjunction with ""O Cracker Where Art Thou"" Cracker has reinvented themselves, with more emphasis on the country/bluegrass side of rock and roll. If David Lowery injected a little more Camper Van experimentation into his songs they could (and well may) find a much larger audience, and become revered for their innovations and longevity."
2,What happened to Cracker?!,I am a huge fan of Cracker. I love all of their other albums. This album is . . . VERY different from their last album. Check it out if you're a die-hard Cracker fanatic. Hopefully this album was just an experiment and they'll go back to their former selves for the next one.
4,i was surprised - but like it,"i always like cracker, especially their first two albums. i really liked this one and would heartily recommend it. i agree with a previous reviewer in that it is kind of country but not too country."
4,A top review,"TechTV (The Screensavers TV show) has rated this multi-format burner right in there with the more expensive Sony brands- It takes a few more seconds to burn a CD, but it is faster burning DVDs (it still takes about 15-20 minutes to burn 3.5GB). I may wait until these burners get a little faster, but if I were in the market for one now, this is the one I'd get!"
1,Good Reader bad Writer,"According to the review on www.tomshardware.com this DVDRW can read old and scratched DVDs and this is absolutely TRUE. But writing skills is amazingly poor. I already exchanged one because smoke was coming out from it. New one damaging during the recording process 40% of DVDs. Nero some times showing funny message. ""Focus Tracking Error ..."". Validation of recorded disks failing in 99%. It doesn't matter DVD is brand name or generic."
2,Not made in England,"This is described as made in England. It is not - it is made in Malaysia. Colors are lighter and not as rich as the dishes made in England. I would buy a different dish - one that is made in England instead of a ""knock off"" made in the far east. Does not have the workmanship of old time Spode."
1,Don't buy,The sticker or superglue they used to put the cover sheet on the pan is impossible to get. I tried soaking it and scraping with a knife and only succeded in scratching the pan up. I even tried using degreaser and it wouldn't even budge. TRUST ME DON'T BUY.
2,NOT for Toaster Ovens - Misleading size description,"I purchased this cookie sheet for use in my Krups 6 slice toaster oven. I measured to make sure a 9 by 12 inch would fit... it would. When my cookie sheet arrived I was REALLY disappointed to find that 9x12 was the INSIDE measurement - outide was closer to 10x13 and just a little too big to fit. (no where in the product description did I see the actual outside dimensions)I've given it 2 stars because I was pleased with the overall quality of the cookie sheet. If it fits your oven you won't be disappointed, as for me - I'm still looking."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"First, I would not call this heavy gauge in the least bit. I bought this to use in our RV oven since I needed something no more than 15x15 and that size cookie sheet is hard to find. I have the same sized pan by Pampered Chef and it's significantly heavier duty than the Norpro. I decided to go with the Norpro because I didn't want to pay double the price for something to go in the RV. As soon as the opportunity presents itself, I will replace this with the Pampered Chef version. Even foods that don't require a greased cookie sheet stick to this. Yes, it does come with a paper taped to the inside of the pan, and yes the tape is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove. I almost returned it simply because I couldn't get the tape off. Disappointing purchase........"
2,Sticky Label Can Be Removed,"Yes, the glue for the label is not acceptable, but it can be removed. Lighter fluid and a lot of elbow grease will remove the tacky adhesive. The supplier should use some other type of adhesive, no excuse. That being said, the cookie sheet is wonderful. I knew the label would be an issue, but I ordered the cookie sheet anyway, and it is of good quality and bakes evenly and well. Fits perfectly in the Breville oven.Alana"
4,Bakeware,"Some people seem to of had problems with these cooking sheets but my wife and I really like them so whatever they have found wrong with them has passed us by. Use them and clean them correctly and you will find a great product. Thank you over and over again Amazom for hitting the nail right on the head as always. I have come to the point where no matter what I want to buy I always research it on Amazon ""FIRST"" before I make any decision. Thank You Again"
5,Replaced pan that disappeared,I do not know why the pan that came with our toaster oven so I had to order one and new amazon would have it. Works great.
3,larger than advertised,"Good stainless steel baking pan, but the description did not make it clear that 9X12 was the inside dimension and that, since the sides slope up and out, the overall size is actually larger. Thus it did not fit into the toaster over I had intended it for."
2,Larger than described,"Great quality cookie pan, but it actually measures 9 1/2"" x 13"" - I bought it to use in a 12"" square toaster oven, and it sadly does not fit."
4,Excellent Pan - A little small,"I've alway liked aluminum pans, and these are worth the extra couple of dollars more than the ""non-stick"" pans that start to rust after several months of heavy use. The pans are a very thick aluminum and very sturdy. They are big enough to hold anything, clean up easily, and if anything does get baked on, I can scrub as hard as I want without damaging them.These pans might be a little small for some thing, but they are incredibly useful when a large pan isn't needed. The larger version of these are definitely the best general purpose baking pans that I own."
4,Very nice pan...does not fit a toaster oven,"I purchased this for my toaster oven that is supposed to fit a 12"" pizza. I thought this pan would fit since it is labeled as 12"". But it did not fit.That by no means makes this pan useless. It is a very nice pan! I am going to buy the larger size too. It does not warp in the oven like some of the thinner cookie sheets. It is nice and heavy but not too heavy. If you make smaller recipes this is a nice little item to buy!"
2,NOT 9 x 12,"This baking pan is made in China - a concern because of their lack of manufacturing standards. You never know what your items are going to be made of and while it says it is 9-Inch by 12-Inch in the item title, that is the inner part of the pan measurements. I made the mistake of assuming the product description was the true size and missed the overall dimensions listed in the product features section. Make sure you know what you are really getting before you buy."
4,"Great pan, Poor manufacturer packaging","This pan came with a label taped on with what appeared to be double-sided tape. I tried everything to get the label off of the pan. What I was left with was a new, unused pan that is scratched up in the middle from me trying to remove the label. I soaked it and tried for a very long time to get the tape off with no success. I finally used a plastic scrub pad, which scratched up the surface of the pan and still did not take the tape off. I finally had to take the advice of a relative and use acetone nail polish remover to get it off and even this took some elbow grease. I would have been very happy with the pan if not for this. The manufacturer needs to seriously re-think how they attach the labels."
2,"Quality pan, but not as a cookie sheet","These pans are good quality, thick aluminum (?), but are not good for use as a cookie sheet. I bought these because they were small enough to fit in our countertop oven, but had some reservations about the height of the sides. I was right. The sides come up way to far, which disrupts the heat distribution around cookies, resulting in crisp bottoms but raw middles. I meant to return it, but waited too long. I think this will make a decent brownie pan, though."
5,"Larry Young and Great, Late Lee Morgan","""Mother Ship,"" organist Larry Young's final recording for Blue Note, is also one of trumpeter Lee Morgan's last great appearances, along with his own ""Live at the Lighthouse"" and ""The Last Session"" (see my reviews). Recorded on February 7, 1969, Larry and Lee's quartet is rounded out by tenor-saxophonist Herbert Morgan (no relation to Lee) and drummer Eddie Gladden. After the multi-layered horn textures and exploration found on his three earlier albums (""Of Love and Peace,"" ""Contrasts"" and ""Heaven on Earth"" -- all out-of-print), in many ways ""Mother Ship"" revisits the classic ""Unity."" Of course once one goes ""out there,"" you never come back quite the same, and ""Mother Ship"" has a style and feel all its own. Since this title is a limited edition in the Connoisseur Series, get on the ""Mother Ship"" while you can."
4,Unique CD ny Larry Young,"Larry Young is more renowned for his earlier Blue Note album ""Unity"" and especially his duet with Elvin Jones on ""Monk's Dream"". However the album is also excellent, and is further down the free jazz road. For many (including myself) the words ""free jazz"" can send us running in the opposite direction but this CD is really worth checking out. Young's simple melodies range from the hauntingly beautiful to the down right catchy. ""Street Scene"" is probably my favourite. The uptempo latin tune ""Love Drops"" is a surprise, starting fairly straight ahead before introducing meter changes. Pity that the horns struggle with the melody at times. The album has a great groove with nice interplay between Young and drummer Eddie Gladden. I found this CD interesting the first time I heard it and it continues to entertain as I discover its many layers."
5,More than worthwhile,"Mother Ship isn't an overwhelming classic the way Unity was, but it does share something in common with the earlier album. It has great compositions, a strong ensemble, and convincing performances. Herbert Morgan plays MUCH better than on Of Love and Peace, and Lee Morgan was experiencing another creative rebirth during this period. Larry's playing is clearly much further along than it was on Unity, pushing toward the freedom that would characterize his playing on Lifetime. (Fortunately, he is much better recorded here than he would be on Emergency! or Turn It Over.) The ensemble is not super-tight, and there are occasional mild flubs, but the overall feeling is of players in tune with each other. There are also some forward-looking jazz-rock grooves.I find it difficult to imagine that any serious Larry Young fan would dislike this album. Out of the 4 Larry Young Blue Note albums I've heard, this is my second favorite."
4,Wow,It was a good book. I like how Joan Lowery Nixon wrote it. I enjoyed Samatha and the clues to find the treasure and it shocked me to find out who the murder was.
5,A book that you will never forget!!!,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I liked the way Samantha was a great detective. I loved trying to figure out who was the killer. I have also read Shadowmaker, but I loved this one the best. This is one book that you have to read!!!!"
5,A game I don't want to play!,"This book was breath taking and exciting. Normaly I would hate a book like this, but this one got me on a hook. It is a must read."
4,Awesome Murder Mystery!,"The Name of the Game was Murder is about a girl named Sam who goes off to visit her aunt and Uncle for 2 weeks. While she is there, she gets wrapped up in a murder, that leads to an somewhat unexpected end. I give this book 4 stars because the author gives away too much in the beginning of the books. Besides that, it is an awesome book for ages 10 and up!"
5,Very Saspecful,"This book had me jumping at the sound of my cat walking I almost was anable to sleep I could not put it dowm all I wanted to do was find out ""who done it"""
2,Not my favorite \ Rachele,"I read this book last year and I found it to be interesting, mysterious, but not near as good as Nixon's other books. The book keeps you guessing, but unlike Whisper's From The Dead, The Seance or Secret, Silent Screams, it has absolutely no interesting characters. I don't particularily like this book. If you want a good book with lots of suspense, try The Seance, or any of Joan Lowery Nixon's other books."
4,Best pre-teen mystery,"If you are between the ages of 9-12, this book is for you. It isn't to scary for those of you that are a scare easy and is a puzzle to find the killer. I reccomend it to any age/sex that enjoys a mystery (it's a fast read too!)"
5,Like new,The site said used but I couldn't find any signs of use. It even came with the screws and washers for mounting onto the body of the sander
4,Great inspiration for kids,"I bought this book to read to my grandkids, this true story is important to young people to learn you can do anything that you put your heart and mind to."
5,Very Cool Spider Book For All Ages!,"About the only point of contention is that the author feels as many people love spiders as hate them! (Does he really belive that?) Outside of that small complaint , this is among the best creepy crawly books out there! Starting out with the mythological birth of spiders in Lucretius's ""Metamorphosis"", you'll learn all about the truly weird creatures we have labelled ""Arachnids"". From the Tarantula dance to Darwin's comment on some very strange specimens, to gossamer skies, and various poisons, you can't miss with this one! Includes some nifty drawings, too! So if you have any interest in the huges Spider species, check this book out!"
5,Attention Arachnerds!,"If you love spiders, if you know a good deal about them, if you're new to the arachnid section of the invertibrate world, or even if you're afraid of spiders, this book is for you. Everything you could want to know about spiders is in here- from basic anatomy to behaviour to the history of Arachnology. Hillyard covers every spider myth from around the world- including variations on each one!I have to say, the references are one of the best features. I found several books and spider-oriented people I didn't know were out there and can now broaden my spider knowledge even further."
3,always look twice,this book was okay but still not as good as some books i've read it took me a while to finish it but i got there
1,"Vanity, thy name is business book writing ..............","The writers are illiterate. "" ... the first buying criteria is price."" (P 89)The content is built around the work of other writers (credited), and cobbled together very poorly.They've come up with a great title, but let themselves down badly inside the covers."
3,Cruise Ship Tycoon,This is a good basic beginner game for those that like to build different types of business's. I would recommend playing a game like this or mall tycoon before trying one of the more expensive games on the market.
3,fair game.,There were no instructions so its real hard to know what to do. otherwise its a good game with good graphics.
2,Missing 2 female 6an with barb adapters,Had this installe at the car dealer by a mechanic and discovered it was missing 2 fittings-6an fittings are not the easiest to find!
3,Female perspective,I think many of the exercises on this video are really tough for women...they require upper body strength to keep the flow smooth and to keep the rhythm. I wish there was a version more geared for women. I will use the video though. I like the run thru he does first.
3,"As always, a ""good read""","I have read 26 of Mr. Brett's books. This book, the second in his new series, is not up to his usual standards. Previousely his lead characters were well presented, warts and all. Carole is not as colorful a character as Charles Paris or Mrs. Pargeter although she is improving. I could do without Jude, she's rather boring, in fact the dog is more engaging. Ted has real possibilities and the addition of other villagers would help. With this said, I did enjoy the book although I'll probably wait for the paperback next time."
1,The Sexual Teachings of the White Tigress: Secrets of the,"I thought this book was rubbish, and I did not finish reading it."
2,New Age not Academic,"There is a fine line between new age thinking and academic information. I am one who enjoys a balanced mix of both. This book however tends to be on the new age side of things. While it does incorporate ancient bits of text, it interprets them in such a way that I feel it lacks legitimacy. Don't get me wrong, there are some interesting philosophies within the pages but over all, I was disappointed. Check out ""The Art of the Bedchamber"" by Douglas Wile instead."
5,mary wells is fabulus,"Mary Wells was practically the breaking ground for motown, wasn't she fabulus?"
2,Here we go again on the bandwagon,"This book, as is popular today is trying to blame all the native's problems on the white man. Oh come on! When do people start taking responibility for their own actions? I tried to read this book but it was a waste of time. Since this author is in jail for killing his own son... let me guess, did we the whites make him do what he did? It seems to me he is still trying NOT to take responibility for his actions and until that changes, nothing will change. I am white but I am not destroying my life or the people around me just because I was abused as I grew up and my kinsfolks were taken as slaves generations ago, do I allow that to effect me today. Wake up people! If you do not like your life, you have the power to change it. Stop the blame game. Life is hard, deal with it, get over it and start your life fresh. It is your decisions that determind your destiny."
1,Please For the Love of All That is Zombie!!!!,"Please, please, Don't buy this movie!! Read the other One star reviews and BELIEVE them. I am a big B-movie and low budget movie fan and if I can rate this at a -5 stars I would. It is really bad and I tried to give it a chance, I really did! All I can say is that go into a dark, cold, damp, disgusting space, spend two hours there and beat yourself with a stick the whole time, you will get the same feeling as watching this movie! To wrap it up, bad movie, bad, bad movie!"
1,Throw the makers of this film out of the nation!,"The zombies talk, the zombies look like slutty women with dark rings around their eyes.. There are only three or four zombies in the movie, more like a cheap hooker undead hang out, far from being a nation.. The story is poor, the budget is bad, I had to watch this movie in sections over a three day period.. I honestly couldn't take watching it in one sitting.. Twenty minutes of this movie felt like a long torturous week on the sofa.When people make zombie movies like this and you buy it, you're screwed.. were all screwed.. THE WHOLE BLASTED NATION IS SCREWED!!!! :)"
2,Even YOU could do better!,"If you had a few thousand dollars, some friends, and cursed every other word, you could make a film like this. The cover of the box is the only cool thing about this; why were there no zombies like it in the movie? I fast-forwarded through half of the movie."
1,Hardly a nation,"This movie runs about an hour and twenty minutes. You go 50 minutes without any mention, tease or appearance of any zombies. When the zombies did come, they were just women with too much eye shadow on, and there were only 5 of them. I don't have any problems with low budgets, and I actually rented it with the hopes that it would be comically bad (like Bloodz vs. Wolvez or The Gingerdead Man). It was bad alright, but it was almost intolerably bad. The cover and the trailer made it look like it would be really good, too, so its especially disappointing. This really isn't worth a rental, let alone a buy."
2,Eat Cheeseburgers Like Everybody Else,"I picked up my copy of ZOMBIE NATION at a pawn shop for two bucks, so I don't feel as bad about it as those reviewers who paid full price.The other reviews have covered the questionable plot very well. I just have to mention the only twist to the story: The Zombie Raccoon Women eat the Bad Cop alive. When they tell the Voodoo Priestesses what they have done, they are informed that they don't have to eat human flesh. ""What should we eat?"" says a ZRW. ""Eat what everybody else eats,"" replies a VP. ""Cheeseburgers.""If there is anything this movie has plenty of, it's cheese.Let me encourage you to watch some other well-done off-the-wall zombie flicks like ""Shatter Dead"" and ""Feeding the Masses."" Both will satisfy your blood lust and your quirk lust (if there is such a thing.)"
1,CRAP X GARBAGE/WASTE OF TIME=ZOMBIE NATION,Nothing else to say. My title says it all. Other reviewers sure hit the nail on the head for this one. I was peeved I spent $2.50 to rent it.
1,why would peopel waste money?,"hands down the worst zombie movie ever made, if not the worst movie ever made. DO NOT BUY THIS !!! i wont go in to detail, as there is none to go into. just know youve been warned. sucks on a scale of one to ten as a negative number."
1,Zombies?,I made the mistake of watching this. I kept watching HOPING it may eventually get better. It never did. Re-caulking my bathtub was more entertaining.
3,B for Bad but it's still entertaining.,"Zombie Nation seems like a movie that ran out of money early on in prodcution and the story was changed midway to secure the rest of the fianancing. I have to give some credit to Ulli Lommel. Instead of junking the movie, he decided to finish and release it. Is it bad? Yes, but it's funny and not to be taken seriously. A LAPD officer with a thick Baverian accent claiming to be from the south, a crazy shrink who thinks he's in the Marathon Man ""Is it safe?"" and Voodoo zombies? If you're expecting a slick CGI film filled with a multi-million dollar budget, then look elsewhere. But if you want to see something that's ""different"" and you want to be ""entertained"", then this movie's for you."
4,One of our favorites,"A cute, fun to read book which entertains the little ones and even gives the adults a chuckle at the end. Definately a favorite in our home."
5,Best of the Modern Kids Stories,"I stumbled on this book the first time at the local supermarket, and loved it instantly - as did my two kids (2 1/2 & 3 1/2). The story is simple, not too wordy. But it's also clever, so I can enjoy reading it, too. The art is fabulous, with clever drawings with a 50s-ish feel, but ultimately modern. This book will likely become a classic. I've given it as a present several times."
5,Cute story!,"This book had my very grumpy and hard to please three year old giggling, which is more than I expected. It's a cute story, and I personally love the vintage looking illustrations."
4,sweet,A very sweet book...easy to read over and over and over and over.Our 2 1/2 year old requests it.
2,Yawner,"While I have the utmost respect for the service of Mr. Delezen and the constant dangers that he and his teammates faced, I didn't really enjoy his writing style, which appeared to be very philosophical and lacked a great amount of detail. It almost seemed to be written in the third person with an effort to explain the emotional and psychological gyrations of a combat soldier."
2,Nursery Rhymes book w/ CD's,This was a birthday present for our little girl. It looked like a great gift until we started listening to the CD's. It sounds like an extremely gay guy (not judging his sexual preferences but there is A LOT of lisping and S'sss) singing with a older woman. Its actually so bad its fun to play and make fun of. The company needs a better talent scout.YUCK
3,Foot pump is retarded,"We bought this because we thought the foot pump sounded like a good idea. No batteries to die or recharge. The air mattress itself is good and fine, but the foot pump is a waste of time. Yeah it works..... after a while, but your foot might go numb in the process. We went camping and borrowed a friend's battery operated pump to inflate instead. It held the air and was comfy. Save your moula and buy one w/ a battery operated pump."
1,Deflated.,"Self pump didn't work, had to blow it up manually. that sucked big time. Can't count on this in the future."
3,pump sucks,"The matress is great. It stayed inflated and was very comfortable. The foot pump on it is basically worthless though so if you dont have a battery operated pump, you will be inflating this bed for a long time."
5,Love this CD,Lionel Ritchie is the man! I find myself singing to one song after another. Great listen for when I'm in a mellow mood...
5,Aways Awesome,"Well, Once again Mr Richie comes out with a great CD ! All you need to do is put it in your CD player kick back and relax . A+"
4,Oldies you can enjoy,"The clarity is good, the selection of songs were as well. Would recommend it.Rather have a DVD versus an MP3 download..."
1,Innacurate information,"We bought this edition because we really liked an older edition and wanted to have updated information for our trip. We went to at least three wineries looking for particular varietals that this book said they produced -- none of them had them. The wineries said they hadn't produced them in ""years."""
5,"Concise, accurate, extremely easy to use!","This is the ONLY book we use as a guide for accomodation, restaurants, and wineries because it is so concise, accurate, and easy to use."
4,Entropy Acceleration,"Fantasy super tech, mutations and cyberwear all geared to the service of a group chaotic outsiders whose goal is entropy. This book has a lot of goodies for DMs although a lot of what is in here is very, very powerful the price for this power can be quite steep. Designed to slipped rather seamlessly into virtually any campaign this little tool box is a treasure trove of toys that can be used for great effect by any DM for a good old fashioned scare or used as ""Things Man was not Meant to Know"""
1,Broken in Three Days,"The first night it worked great. I was so happy to have a warm bed to get into. Night two only half of the bed got warm, and by night three it didn't work at all. It's going back on Monday.There are several other reviews like mine where the mattress pad broke within a couple of nights or didn't work at all. What I'm wondering is: what is Amazon doing with all of these returned mattress pads? Are we all just buying each other's? And if so many people have a problem with this product, why does Amazon continue to carry it?"
5,Amazing!,"Heat rises, a simple concept put into good practice with this amazing product. There's not much else to say, if you're cold when you go to bed get this, it solves the problem."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"We first bought the queen size with dual controls that has worked well most of the time (sometimes it gets confused and all the lights blink - you unplug it and then plug it back in) so we got this model. It worked for a couple of weeks and now only one side of the bed heats up. This is a very basic, simple product. There is no excuse for a product like this to fail. It is more trouble than it is worth to try and return. The other problem on all of these is that when you adjust the temperature setting it clicks just loud enough it may wake a sleeping partner. We read the reviews of other buyers who had problems and thought they might be just flukes. BIG mistake! Design and / or quality control are a problem."
4,A good item for Cold Feet,"I bought this heated mattress pad for my dad for Christmas. It was reasonably priced and seems to work quite nicely. I didn't realize it got hotter in the foot area compared to the torso, so I wouldn't buy one for myself...but my father seems pleased. It's great for those who get ""cold feet""."
5,Total Warmth and Comfort,The good thing about having this heated mattress pad is that it also keeps the area at the head of the bed warm. While electic blankets only warm the covered parts of your body - the heated mattress pad allows your head to feel some warmth under the pillow. The heat is less intense at the head of the bed than it is toward the foot of the bed which makes it pleasant for sleeping.
1,Heated Mattress Pad,"If there is a power outage, the digital control for this mattress pad does not come back on when power is restored. I consider this to be a serious design flaw. Where I live there can be momentary or brief power interruptions or ""bumps"" in the line between three and five o'clock in the morning. The mattress pad warmth goes off and stays off when this happens. I wake up cold and have lost the benefit of a full night's sleep. I'm going to have to buy a universal power supply or battery back-up like you would use for your computer. This is going to in effect double the cost of owning the mattress pad."
3,OK for the price,"First of all, five starts for Amazon's customer service. Not a surprise: I have been spoiled over the years by Amazon, but it never hurts to repeat. The first item delivered was defective. Half of the bed was not heated. So, Amazon promptly delivered another bed warmer (without waiting for me to return the old one-yay!), which works like it's supposed to-which means, not so great. It warms the bed, but it takes a long time even at the highest setting, so if you forget to turn it on at least one hour before bed, your bed will be quite cool. I bought a bed warmer because I want to slip into a *warm* bed, not a bed that's only marginally warmer than my cold bedroom. However, for the price and the added convenience of its being machine washable, this product will do the trick, and without adding much to your electricity bill."
1,Not good!,"I purchased this full, heated mattress pad for the guest bedroom. On the second night of use the heated mattress pad stopped working! Also, it is quite large for the mattress even though I purchased the correct size for my mattress. I'd stay away from this one in the future."
5,Heated Mattress Pad,Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved. thank you
1,so very disappointed,"we had a heated pad for years that finally played out. it was wonderful. wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one, i bought this item. i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it. i was suspect when i opened it. poor quality material. poor bed fit. very very warm on the lowest setting. after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires, which are quite large, in my ribs--it had to come off. i had rather be cold and i hate being cold."
1,Stopped working after just a few weeks,"Felt guilty about having my own mattress pad heater (for years now!) and keeping the house cooler with my kids in their cold beds. Bought a Sunbeam for my son, and this one for my daughter. It worked for about two weeks, then the controller stopped working consistently. Now it won't stay on and heat the bed at all. Thank goodness Amazon realizes that although I bought it on the 9th, it was a Christmas gift and have allowed me to return it by Jan 31. Another brand for me!! I guess you can luck out with a good one, but we got a faulty one."
2,Heated Mattress pad,"I bought this for our daughter who's bedroom tends to be chilly.It warms slightly, and the pad itself is thin so you feel the coil more so than heated pads we've had in the past.I wish I'd taken the time to look up what brand of pad is on the other beds!"
2,should send back,"i bought this for my teenage daughter, she says that it takes a while to heat this up, & that it says it is on in the night but it cools down randomly, it is 2 weeks old, & i should have boxed it up & shipped it back."
3,Great idea - short lived product,"Wife loved the throwback model - but receiver is hardwired to phone so cord cannot be replaced and deterioriated rapidly. Receiver is very heavy, dropped twice, came apart, now superglued, but not as good as original. Replacement parts were not available. Buying new one impractical - life cycle too short."
3,Realistic Oil Painting Techniques by Kurt Anderson,"Realistic Oil Painting Techniques by Kurt AndersonIt's o.k. I've enjoyed leafing through it, though I've had more educational books."
4,Solid Release For The Goodie Mo.B,"After the backlash the group received from ""World Party"", Goodie Mob returns closer to form with this release. The powerful ""God I Wanna Live"" has Soul Food written all over it. The two thing that brought this album down was when the group ventures outside of their comfort zone (namely ""In da Streets"", ""Grindin"", & about 2 or 3 others) and the obvious void left by Mr. Ceelo Green. But if you compare this album to a lot of garbage that's out now, you can see the goodness (no pun intended) of the album. Nowadays, any album with more than 5 tolerable songs is considered a good album. Anyway, this is a pretty good album by my standards. Even without Ceelo, it could have been 4.5 stars by excluded the forementioned tracks and adding 4 Organized Noize tracks to replace them. Still worth listening to though."
2,Not impressed,"This one was a disappointment to me. Too many repetitive, boring beats. Not much to make it different from any other ""dirty south"" album you've heard lately. Like many, I miss the Soul Food days. The one standout on the album is the Play Your Flute song. I could listen to that one all day."
4,Its just the beginning,"This is an real solid effort even though cee-lo is missing. Honestly they did better than i thought they were, and the reason is because they did not try to fill his shoes. no its not a soul food or still standing, don't buy this expecting that or you will be disappointed. If u liked gipp album u will luv this one, the boys are spitting lyrics over some real good beats. Its not a soulful record as much as it is an dirty south record. They got a lot of backwood trap muzik on here that works because it makes u 4get cee-lo.I hope they get back 2gether, and practice what they preach. That ""we won't make without each other"". O.M.N.I."
3,Not My Favorite Goodie Mob Album,"Next to Timbaland & Magoo, Goodie Mob is my second favorite rap group. They have released many of great albums, but this is for sure not one of them. The beats on this album could have been better (mostly on Play Your Flute) same with the album's lyrics, and flows. If you want Goodie Mob's best, the just pick up Soul Food, and forget buying this album until you have there other albums. I hope there next album is better."
3,Sooo disrespectful!!!,"In HIP-HOP there are few things that gets bigger than BEEF. In HIP-HOP ""BEEF"" can make you (ie. 50 Cent) or break you (ie. Ja-Rule).This ""BEEF"" in the GOODIE MOB is a total waste of creative mind space. Just the title of the album is SUPER wrong. And would be hard for any member of any group to hold his/her head up, take the high road and rejoin a group after a very direct diss. As you can see from the album cover. I take it that ""CEE-LO"" is 2nd from the left. Now thats just ICE COLD. This album is like going to a concert and one of the main attractions not showing up and they just let the music play in his part...BBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!In this case the ""SUM"" is bigger than the ""PARTS"". GOODIE MOB = Cee-Lo, Khujo, T-Mo Goodie, and Big Gipp, which has been functioning since 1995. Saying that to say this........ IF THE 4 NAMES ABOVE ARE NOT TOGETHER............ITS NOT GOODIE MOB.And after listening to this album, I'm not sure what it is. I do know its not....Goodie."
1,The Goodie tree has fallen,"This album was a huge disappointment. I was a HUGE Goodie fan until this drivel came out. Cee-lo pulled the Goodie sound together and he is truly missed. The beats sound like they came out of one of Master P's late 90's ""lets make an album in 10 days"" efforts.I will forever remember Goodie as a two album group and wash this album from my memory."
1,Not powerful at all for the size;,"For the size of this thing (and the fact that it takes C-batteries) this thing is super weak. I had high hopes for it, but it only gets me about halfway there."
2,Cheap,"Very weak and loud, not worth the cost of c batteries! I have a slimline vibe from Doc Johnson that takes AA batteries and is much stronger"
4,First Time Using A Vibrator ^-^,"When I paid and received it, I was so happy to try it but sadly it didn't came with the batteries, so I ran to the store and bought the batteries, but that really doesn't bother me at all. What bothers me a bit is that it's kinda noisy and it's not waterproof, so you really can't use it in the shower. Though it has good vibrations and it's really strong as well. I like it very much! It was my first time purchasing a vibrator and I'm only 18 :) I'll be sure to be purchasing more of Doc Johnson's vibrators :D"
2,average,was not too impressed with video. children were a bit bored and i found this miss pattycake video a little sloppy.
4,Works well,This fork thermometer takes an accurate temp reading; and is a good deal for the price. It does have one quirk -it has a button to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit which I keep accidentally hitting when I hold the fork. So I end up reading the temperature wrong because it has inadvertently changed to Celcius. Just be aware of this and the fork will work fine for all sorts of cooking.
5,Awesome Meat Thermometer,This works great as a fork and a meat thermometer. It reads fast and accurate. The fork is quite strong and hold up great even when using it to flip large tri-tips. I use this as my primary BBQ fork now.
3,Slow but accurate,"Very...very.....slow....to read a temperature. The temperature goes up by about 3 degrees per second. This gets to be annoying when holding it over a 500 degree BBQ. The display is not back-lit, so had to read in the evening light. The temperature seems accurate, and it is easy to use. Construction is solid enough. Overall, good for the price but I would pay more for a faster one with a back light next time."
1,Too slow to be usable,I ordered this based upon the reviews and my experience with Taylor products in the past. Was I ever disappointed. It was soooo slow in measuring the temperature. I am standing there with the fork in the hamburger and watching the numbers slowly creep upwards. I had to stop before it was completed because my hand got too hot from the fire. Don't waste your money.
1,Ruined a fifty dollar steak,This thermometer said my three-inch thick dry-aged prime porterhouse was still blood rare when it was cooked to medium well. Total junk. Don't waste your money.
4,Cook Out made easier,This is great for people like me that are never sure when the steaks are done to the stage I want!
2,Not such a great thermometer,"I bought this based on the reviews here at Amazon but to be honest, there didn't seem to be a clear winner for this category no matter what the price is. I had a similar fork that died recently after about 8 years if service. Wish I knew who made that one because it was excellent. This one is not accurate. A steak reading of Rare at 140 degrees was actually cooked medium+. Another reading medium was cooked throughout and dry. This is the 3rd time using the fork and most likely the last."
2,Slow to read temp,"I bought this as a replacement for another temp fork that I had that quit working. This unit takes forever compared to the other one I had to read the temp. You have to ""preheat it"" before sticking it into what you're cooking to get a reading. I have quit using it to read the temp and now just use it as a fork."
2,Worked Well For A Year,The thermometer worked great for about a year. It was used year round but mostly in the summer time. After a year it would start beeping and not turn off. Had to pull the batteries each time to turn the unit off. Eventually it just died.
1,"Worked well twice, then dead","I bought this in June based on reviews on Amazon. I just pulled out the unit to use it for a late season BBQ and it's dead. 3 sets of brand-new, confirmed-working batteries, unit is dead. Amazon has no return policy for it and I'm now looking to get something from ""Taylor""."
4,Fine Collection and Commentary on Cuisine Influences,"Taking Chineese, Greek and Roman cooking influences, Smith ofTV fame brings forth an offering which resembles the James Beard books which provide not only great recipes but a running commentary on the culture which produces the food and some experience remembrances by the author.This is fun cooking and well done. Well representative of the cuisines and done with helpful hints on each.A workhorse for the cook willing to use it to branch out and experiement in these formative areas of food history. For openers, try Spareribs with Black Beans and Pepper Sauce, Halvah Cake or the Seafood Risotto.My humble opinion is that Roman cooking is slighted out of the three. See Malto Mario for some great Rome recipes."
5,Mom uses this all the time,"Although the author has a shady reputation, my mom loves this book, though I'm not thrilled with all the recipes."
5,Worked perfect!!,"We used the porta potty for the 1st time this past weekend weekend. We have 3 small children and wanted something to set up in our pop up camper at night so we wouldn't have to take them to the bathroom if they woke up in the middle of the night. Turns out the kids didn't use it at all but, I used it several times in the middle of the night! We lined the bucket with a trash bag so the mess would be contained! The next morning I just pulled the trash bag out and took it to the dumpster...there was no mess. It worked out perfect!!!!"
2,Sooooooo totally disappointed !!!!,"I've not been so disappointed/disillusioned on anything that I've bought on Amazon prior to this purchase. Sadly I wsn't able to ship it back within the return period.This product is so thin & flimsy, not to mention so low to the ground you almost fall trying to sit on it, if you dare.I bought this to take camping since at times you don't know how far away from the potty's you'll be. Needles to say (from above) it never made the trip.My opinion, unless you're going to use this for a male or a child, I wouldn't waste my money !!!I'll go to Lowes/Home Depot get one of their high buckets, put a bag in it, an old toilet seat from my basement & have a much better porta-potty then this. Which is what I'm going to do for my next trip."
3,emergency toilet,I bought this to add to my earthquake preparedness supplies. For that purpose is is too bulky and does not have storage space inside for much. It would probably work fine as a camping toilet but for my purpose a 5 gallon plastic bucket with a snap on seat takes up less storage room and can store other sanitary supplies.
3,ok for what it is,Has strong weight capacity. Basically a bucket with handle inside a brown larger bucket that acts as a seat. Brown outter container should be made with a standard bucket handle but it doesn't so get really comfortable carrying it with two hands like a pan of cookies. Would have rated higher if had a proper handle.
5,Porta Potty,"I love this potty!!! We just built a cabin with indoor plumbing, but have it winterized right now. So we aren't able to use the faucets or the toilet. I was using the woods, until it was extremely cold to do so. I bought this portable toilet and it's working out great!! I put it in the bathroom closet, which has a heater and a light. I am using 2 garbage bags in it, and when we leave the cabin, I just take the bags out of the toilet, and bring it with me to dispose of at home. By using the plastic bags inside the potty, it's never smelly. It's lightweight, and plenty sturdy for me. Once we turn the water back on in the cabin, I'll just put this potty up in the storage area. It really doesn't look like a potty, so we can store it anywhere. I love it and highly recommend it!! Great price and great quality. In fact, I just saw the exact potty at Gander Mountain for $10. more."
1,Poor Excuse for Materials and Workmanship,"I was really looking forward to receiving this product, but was extremely disappointed when I examined it. This product would not sit flat on the floor and would rock from side to side. The manufacturer did not finish trimming the interior wall after removing it from their mold. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"needs a BETTER LID, folks","My only problem with this potty (actually bought it at Academy) is that the lid that fits on it, and holds the toilet paper, does not become a lid that fits when you try to carry it . . across the campground to empty it . . and you run into people you talk to, at midnight, carrying an open bucket of waste. The lid simply needs notches in it so it will work with the handle when carrying. I guess I could have attempted that, but I was pretty irritated (I ran into people BOTH times when emptying, and I sure wasn't going to do that in the daylight, with no lid) so I just returned it. I will splurge and buy the flushing type, for my husband's needs, shall we say.Good idea, decent price, but ya gotta have a working lid for carrying it, for most applications I would say."
4,Convenient little toilet,"This little porta potty is convenient, and stable. I use it in my horse trailer for overnight stays at races for those late night trips. The one thing I would change is the seat part that just sits on the top. It's made out of light weight plastic. I'm not a very big person (5""2"" 135 lbs) and the seat gives me some concern about it sturdiness for a heavier person or wear and tear over time. I've only had this item for a month."
5,PORTABLE POTTIE,THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I AM HAPPY WITH IT BUT IT DOES NOT FIT UNDER MY BED IN THE POP UP CAMPER...ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS TOO HIGH BUT OTHERWISE IT IS GREAT.. IT CAN BE USED AS AN OUTSIDE SEAT TOO IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE IT AS A POTTIE SO IT HAS OTHER USES.. IT IS TOTALLY EASILY CLEANABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO RUN TO THE BATHROOM WHEN CAMPING OVERNIGHT.
5,Got these to add to my first aid kits,"I'm glad I purchased these, as I had a use for one of them a couple weeks back. I had one of my contacts roll up in my eye, and I couldn't get it out. 15 seconds with one of these and the contact rinsed out and ended up in the eye cup. Very handy to have in a pinch."
3,"""Love that Lodge""","Purchased the 7 quart model some months ago. Used it the day after it arrived. I noticed the pot had a hump in the center of the bottom. The high spot caused a hot spot and lent itself to burning no matter what I tried. I fired off an Email to Lodge, and explained my problem. Their reply was immediate, and said they would supply a UPS mailer so I could return it. (Glad I saved the original carton.) I had no problem with their customer service. My replacement came two weeks later, and this one had a flat bottom. After using it numerous times I've become a ""Lodge Fan"" I gave it 3 stars based on their quality control. Not on the pot's performance or their customer service which was superb. My inconvenience, and the cost of the replacement could have been avoided if quality assurance had been better. Especially when spending $[...] for this item or any tem of theirs for that matter."
2,This is not domestic cast iron. (edited),"Lodge is trying to sneak in Imported items and trade on the Lodge name.Yes, I own the pot. I give it a technical rating of 3 of 5: sufficient but not impressed. The competing Le Creuset 6-3/4-Quart Oval model performs better, and is the oven in my kitchen instead of the garage. The Lodge oven falls short of expectations in the areas of heating evenness(less than LC), lid handle design (metal, hot), pot handle size (too small, uncomfortable shape).When offered colors include ""patriot red"" and ""liberty white"", it seems pertinent to point out that this was built by exploited foreign workers while trading on patriotic brand recognition.Moreover, Lodge's foreign suppliers have not provided me the same high quality that Lodge used to. This lack of integrity loses the product another star. I'll look elsewhere in the future."
1,SO disappointed...!!!,"I flipped when I saw a cook on the food channel using this pot; it IS fabulous looking. Then I learned it is a cheap Chinese knock-off of my beloved French cast iron cookware. Am I glad I stayed with the Le Creuset!!! At least the French are free to compete with us. Shame on you, Lodge! I'll keep buying the good old American cast iron skillet (I have my GRANDMOTHER's Lodge skillet), but you can keep your made-in-China junk!Update: no wonder American manufacturing jobs are disappearing. If you buy these pans but can't find a good job, look in the mirror."
3,Check it carefully for defects,"Our pot had a lopsided bottom and would teeter back and forth on a burner or flat surface. I sent an eMail to Lodge and they replaced it at their cost. However the replacement is also defective. The bottom is flat but the top edge of the pot is not. Consequently the top rocks back and forth and leaves an open gap about the thickness of a round toothpick on one side or the other. The top also has blemishes in the enamel, like ""fish eyes"". We are tired of dealing with defective Made In China merchandise and haven't decided if we want to take a chance on another replacement or live with this one. Nevertheless, we only paid $74.99 for it on sale at Amazon so it is well worth the price but I would not pay full price for one."
5,Great pot with attractive looks,"I was looking to acquire an enamel cast iron pot that I could use to cook stews and soups with. I did not want to pay $300 + for the 7 quart Le Creuset pot, so I decided to go with the Lodge.Good cooking - I have made several stews and pot roasts, all tasting wonderful. My method is as follows: I brown the meat and then add vegetables. I cook the mix for 3 hours (or more) at very low heat before adding flavoring. The meat is always tender and falling off the bone. The dishes also has rich flavor.Easy cleanup - The pot is very easy to clean because of the enamel coating. I also have a cast iron pot (no enamel coating), and it is tricky to clean without damaging the pre-seasoning layer on the pot.Good looks - I really like the looks of the pot, especially the nice touches to the handles.So far the pot has worn well and I would highly recommend it."
4,product design,"This product description indicates ""Can be used on gas, electric and ceramic cooktops"". I have a ceramic cooktop and need to purchase flat bottom pots/pans as the manufacturer recommends. I had to assume this product was ""flat bottom"" since description covered this type of cooktop and because there were no photos for the underside(items should be photographed from all angles to assist customers buying online). Would you go into a store to purchase cookware and not turn it over?This is not a flat bottom pot. When you lay a ruler across the bottom, it does not touch the center as it should per ceramic cooktop manufacturer recommendations. I'm a little upset about that. I still have to test it out and will update later.12/12/06 I have now had a chance to try out this Dutch Oven. Used it once for Chicken Cacciatore, another time for homemade sauce and meatballs and another time for Chicken Noodle Soup. Each dish came out perfect.I give this two thumbs up for function and beauty."
5,Spirit Dance,This album is fantastic from start to finish. When the track Fields of Grace plays my spirit dances! Awesome album.
4,It's not my favorite by BDW,"I enjoy listening to this effort, but it's not my favorite Big Daddy Weave album. It deviates a little from their defined style, and not in a bad way, but it's just not my favorite because I prefer their style of going heavy with instruments besides just guitars."
2,Disappointingly Average,"As a big fan of James Carlos Blake's rough & ready characters, I was all set for a new adventure, but this one left me sorely disappointed. Like a few other readers here, I doubt if this was worth the time it took to read it. Extremely cliche, cartoonish. If I had to read any more inane dialogue like ""I'd like to take a bite of THAT apple. Yeah, a BIG bite."" I was going to scream. Where is the freshness in this same tired, worn out old story? None to be found here."
2,Not compelling,"I'm sorry but I just couldn't even finish the book. It reminds me of erotica I used to write when I was a teenager. The story isn't compelling, the characters are transparent and everything is highly boring. And I'm not a prude. I love sex drugs and rock and roll...and bank robbers make for a great story. But this isn't one of them."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"Every time I wear these shoes, I manage to fall down because of the lack of grip on the bottom soles. I gave the shoes a couple of chances and now I'm just going to have to part with them. It's a shame...they look good in the box but they are a pain just to walk and they make these ugly wrinkles on your ankles. Cheaply made, not leather. HORRIBLE will have to be more careful buying shoes I've never tried on before online."
3,Their okay.,Good for belt on belt but won't fit over any more such as in the front of a duty belt is you have excess belt curved through the buckle. I have had these get snagged and pop loose.
1,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a biography about Payne Stewart, this is not it. There is a great deal of information about his death, memorial service, and his faith but very little about Payne. Do we really need to know what body parts were recovered or how much mail the church received after the service? If you are not interested in how the writer thinks faith transformed Payne as a person, pass this one by."
5,Solid. Like the Man.,Very insightful. The author's relationship with Stewart really comes through. A great story about a great competitor and a great man.
1,fictional,an effort to make money from the tragedy of payne stewart's death. i would recommend the authorized biography by tracey stewart.
1,boooooring,"While Kevin Devine's thin and shaky voice sounded somewhat cute on 'circle gets the square' where all songs are very whiny and whimpy, the same voice is totally out of place on 'make the clocks move', an more adult album without any charme.The lyrics are a lot too everyday speech and lack any poetic elements. While his early song 'fingerprints and photographs' contains perfect moments like ""i'm looking at you through a wineglass"" in his new song 'marie' he suggests ""we can rent a movie or something"". It turns out to be a most boring description of a most boring relationship. boring is a good term to describe the whole record.People who liked 'circle gets the square' would be better off buying some Onlinedrawing or Bright Eyes instead. These guys have more to say and they can sing."
2,Half size to a whole size to big,"When you purchase these shoes purchase them at least a half size smaller. I love the look very cute shoe, but they are huge, I was swimming in them!"
3,good but small,does the job but was hard to find a reel that fit properly. The one I ordered and thought would work was way too big.
1,More fiction than fact.,"This book is based on the murderous actions of Mark Hoffman, and in this regard is fairly accurate. However, when it comes to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons), the Church's founding prophet Joseph Smith, and current Church leaders and doctrine, this book is slanted, twisted and just plain wrong. Its inaccuracies cause the book to end up being more fiction than fact. If you are really interested in learning the truth about the Mormon religion you should read The Book of Mormon, visit with some missionaries, and pray to know the truth. Reading this book is not the answer unless you wish to be misinformed."
4,Certainly worth the price for the mechanically inclined...,"It's been 6 years since this book was published, and I believe that many of the fundamental items identified by the author still apply. Most investors are looking for rules for identifying good stocks, and using these techniques offers someone a way to actually test the results they could expect - at least if you're willing to use a service like ValueLine. The only downside of the book was in the lack of exploring additional ideas - things like shorter holding periods, stop-loss strategies, diversification across industries, etc. For the price, buy it!"
2,O'Shaughnessy's Other Books Are Much Better,"I read this book many years ago. O'Shaughnessy's other books are much better when it comes to making money in the stock market. I doubt that 1% of the readers of this book ever analized a fund portfolio as prescribed by the author. If you want to make money, read ""What Works On Wall Street"", also by O'Shaughnessy. But you'll need to be VERY math oriented and you'll need to read the book two or three times; but it's worth your time."
3,"It is always good to be prepared for the worst, but","I love DP, but I thought that this episode illustrated how bad information can lead to unnecessary problems for individuals. The last segment about magnetic pole shift is a common misperception. There is currently magnetic pole drift. This is a fact known especially to pilots who witnessed a recent 10 degree change in runway designations. This drift is occurring at about 40 miles a year and is West to slightly Southwest. At the current rate of drift, there is no possibility of the scenario which the last family imagined. Moreover, even if the unlikely event of a complete sudden magnetic pole shift (the south pole becoming the north pole and vice versa), the axis of the planet would not change. For the axis to change, the best likely culprit would be a large external force hitting the planet. In that case, no one anywhere on planet Earth would stand a chance no matter how prepared they were for doomsday."
1,Deception,"Alot of people find this entertaining,and maybe puts a little fear in some folks.Theres people out there that watch this show and probally take it seriously too.Why do some people take it serious? Is it because of the whole ""Mayan thing""? Well,I can PROMISE that if these were Christian people getting ready for the return of Jesus Christ,then these born-again Christians who are in this show would be laughed at,and NOBODY would watch it,because of how ""crazy"" these people are.I wonder why that is.People will put more faith in some nonsense like this,when they really should be getting their lives right with the TRUE God of the Universe and get ready for what's REALLY coming.Believe in what the Holy Word Of God says and don't be decieved by Satan and his lies."
4,AWESOME!,"paranoia at it's finest! some of these people are crazy, but if you pay attention you will pick up some good pointers, as everyone should have some basics around for emergencies. will i start hiding food in my mattress?? NO!"
4,Not completely stupid like the current season,The people here are not a bunch of complete idiots like most in the newer shows. Also Nat Geo did a better job of showing more realistic prepping n
4,Enjoyed but not for everyday people,"We enjoy watching this show and getting ideas,But most of these people are either wealthy or using there bill money to prep.The common pay check to pay check person could not do what these people are doing.It does make you think though about some things you wouldn't normally think of."
5,Interesting people,"I like Doomsday Preppers, don't think I am anywhere near like them in terms of preparedness or fear level but I respect what they believe and that they are trying to provide for/protect their families."
4,Great Show,"Great show highlighting the extreme side of prepping, but also gives some good overall tips for the conservative prepper as well. Fun and informative."
5,Thought Provoking,"The information contained within this video series is both thought provoking and sad. While I understand and condone being safety conscious and prepared, some of the people are so far into the lifestyle that it appears they've forgotten to live in the here and now."
2,Just so so,"After watching a couple of episodes of this series, I stopped watching. I am all for being prepared, but some of these scenarios are not plausible, at least in my own imagination.Be as prepared as you are able to be. But also value community. Human relationships are perhaps the best way to prepare. After all, what good is it to have 5 years supply of food if you have to leave (bug out)? You can't bring it all with you. As far as danger to life is concerned, you can die from an abscessed tooth, left untreated.Some times I felt like the purpose of the series was to portray the subjects of the series as mental defectives.I was especially repulsed by the lady who said she would kill her pets if she had to bug out.Take it all with a grain of salt."
2,Gets repetitious after the 3rd show or so,"The first episode of this series was interesting to me - I found the couple a little quirky, but interesting to watch. As I got further into the series, I found myself less interested in the people . . .their fears of (insert apocalyptic event here) become somewhat laughable after a while. I think NG had to stretch this concept a little too thin to be compelling for a full season. Watch the first (and maybe the second) episode(s) - you'll get the gist of the show and the best material. After that point it becomes a bit repetitious and not particularly engaging."
3,"Good in parts, but poor characterisation and plot","Unlike another reviewer here, I didn't find this at all a *complicated* plot. However, like another Lane book I've read, it suffers from poor characterisation. While the heroine, Elizabeth, and Symington himself are well drawn, the rest of the cast seem like mere caricatures, especially Elizabeth's father, Fosdyke. I cannot understand why Symington maintained his masquerade when faced with such an appallingly il-mannered host. Cecilia is similarly unbelievable with her repulsive and incredible attempts to force Symington's friend (pretending to be Symington, remember) into marriage.The mistaken identities do get resolved in the end... somehow... and yet I can't even remember how, now! (not that I'd give it away for anyone who hasn't read the book).I can't recommend this; it pales in comparison with anything from Mary Balogh, Mary Jo Putney, Patricia Oliver or Carla Kelly."
1,How bad the monster brain really is,The monster brain can give you cheats for pokemon gold and silver only! You can't use it for any thing else! Once pokemon goes out of season you will hate yourself
1,14 year old boy Dominik pruss' review,It is the best gameboy assesorie I had you can edit any pokemon game and it won't ware out. It is extremely recomended!
1,Won't work,"I couldn't get it to work, it would only display turn off this game. I called and e-mailed Pelican, but got no response. The guys at the store couldn't help and said some accessories actually ruin the games. Can someone e-mail me, because I would really like to use this. Maybe it was defective."
5,The truth about pre-Romanized Europe and its history/,"Among the many things for people interested in the religious history of Europe is that ""Charlemagne"" wasn't so great after all. Absolutely contrary to what we were all taught in school..... even in college!One gets an idea about where customs still existing today arose from. It is a history student's book and a religious history students book as well.A wonderful read for those whose curiousities are not easily satisfied; who might ask, ""Where have we been and where are we going and why?"""
2,Serious Reservations about their presentation of the Balts,"I have serious reservations about the book, considering that their section on Lithuania has some glaring mistakes, one of which is where they claim that a Duke Sventaragis chose the site of Vilnius. Sventaragis was never a person, but a sacred site. Two, in the legends it is Gediminas, one of the major Grand Dukes who is credited with the founding of the capital city.The rest of the text is worth a read, but they should have done further research into the Balts."
1,Unable to snipe!,"I had so much fun with other Hitman games and love them so much, so it was the reason I bought this game without looking at reviews. To my disappointed that this game, you can't snipe. They don't have patch for it."
1,insufficient information on woodgrain rain barrel,Why is there no picture of this woodgrain rain barrel?Is it wooden?Is it a used whiskey barrel?Is it outfitted with downspout fittings and a cover?
3,"Phenomenal Music - Horrific ""Re""Master","I've been a fan of this CD (and Jules Shear) since the album first came out in the late '70's. I was lucky enough to get a copy of the original CD release from Columbia a few years ago, and picked this one up in order to get the extra tracks added to the release. For some reason, the new mastering on this version is miles behind the original Columbia CD release. Muddy, throbbing, compressed...while I've been a fan of some of the other Wounded Bird reissues (fanetiks is really a nice package), I'd avoid this one unless you want the extra tracks (which are, IMHO, worth the money, but I was expecting to be able to retire the original Columbia CD)."
5,NICE- Been waiting for this one...,"Welcome back to the world, hip hop-- this album is for all the fans that remember listening to Lyricist Lounge CDs years ago, and smiling every time they heard a De La Soul beat or listened to a Black Star line for the second or third time- only then figuring out the trick, the pun, the joke, or why it all sounded so damn good. One of the few hip hop releases in a long time whose lyrics and beats both match up to eachother on every track. Take a close look at the album cover graphics-- the #2 pencils, grid paper, calculators, but also dice, girls, and stereos-- and this'll give you a good idea of what to expect from a HUGELY satisfying debut: sharp, on-point lyrics worth multiple listenings (something you can't say about most hip-hop these days), mixed with crazy well-crafted rhythms and beats that could equally stand on their own as instrumental versions. When's the next album coming, cause i'm waiting..."
2,Lack of Parts,"I bought this plane in June of this year. It flew one time, lacking elevation. I discovered the prop shaft was bent. After contacting Parkzone I was told there would not be any available until 9-20-11. If I had known gettig parts would be so difficult I would not have purchased this item. Kenneth R Mushall"
4,Little Sandbox review,This was an ok set it didn't come with all the fencing in the picture. Not sure if it was suppose to. I was mostly dissapointed that the barn was cardboard. THe puppy's playset had a dog house that wasn't cardboard so I didn't expect the barn to be. THe rest of the set was nothing special but my 3 year old loved it.
1,Controversial book...,"I was really wanting to learn about spiritual warfare, and at first, this book was very informative and seemingly well put together. Then I read the chapter on demons. The author believes they are the souls of the unsaved dead. The evidence he gave for that definitely failed to convince me on it. Most of his backings were quotes of unsaved scholars from the past. I've read the entire bible through and have never came across a verse that hinted that you'd become a demon if you didn't get saved. There's a parable about a man dying and going to HELL, but definitely not transforing into a demon. I just didn't buy it..."
2,Just Okay,"I would rate this book as okay. It doesn't delve deep enough into the subject matter and he tells too many personal stories.Also, he says that evil spirits aren't fallen angels but the souls of the damned or the unsaved dead. I skipped most of that chapter.Overall I wouldn't recommend this book. A few parts are good but most of it is boring."
2,2 and 1/2 really..,"The good info. here is very good but there's so much more winded, no-where going storyline info that's so unneccessary."
4,Thrilling!,"This novel introduces an unusual approach to the plot ofmurder. Conceived by the twisted mind of an abused youthand carried to adulthood with an original weapon, plus theaddition of a background of boxing, it holds the reader'sattention start to finish. I highly recommend it to theavid reader with a penchant for gory and educationalinformation.John P"
5,The Cable Tie murders,"What I can't get over is how disturbed I felt reading this book.As a parent, I can't imagine the extreme cruelty that was inflicted on the child described by author Jef Lynch, but it was in this cruelty that gave me an insight on the development of a serial killer through the killers eyes. ""No remorse, no conscience"" would be a apt name for this book. I enjoyed the character depth of our hero detective and the low-key romance which kept me entertained. I was totally engrossed and recommend this book."
5,Great supergroup CD,"This is one of the few ""super group"" ska bands out there, and it really behooves anyone out there who is a fan of ska to pick this disc up. It's one CD you can listen to straight through over and over again.I have to say that, in general, this sounds like a ""lost"" Reel Big Fish album, i don't know if it's the production quality (which sounds a lot like a RBF album) or what. The other comparison that popped into my head was ""Toasters meets RBF"" (which doesn't really make sense since Toasters had nothing to do with this).Sorry for the rambling review. This CD is excellent, ska fan or not, if you like well written songs that make you feel good even when things are against you, this is the CD to get."
1,Not even a star,"One of the worst [piece of literature] I've ever read. If I knew better, I wouldn't have taken this book for free. What a waste of time."
4,Well done,"Mr. Davis's book fills in a much needed study of early Egyptian Christian leadership and theological disputes. What he does an excellent job in is not only informating the reader about the various popes and patriarchs, but he is also able to explain the theological disputes, such as the arguments regarding the nature of Christ, in terms that anyone can understand. I found the book interesting and easy to read, as well as well-researched.What I would have liked to have more of would have been less of a stress on the issue of colonialism and even nationalism that crept into the book on occasion. I found this discussion speculative and distracting. Although this may sound silly, I would have liked a few more plates in there regarding early Coptic art and architecture. These allow the reader to have a stronger connection to the places and people being discussed.Thank you for an interesting book and I am looking forward to the next book of the series."
3,"Good, but not definitive","I enjoyed reading this book to gain a perspective as to how outside academic circles view the Coptic Orthodox Church, but after finishing it, I must disagree with several of its premises. I believe the author took some liberties in inferences, especially when discussing Saint Mark's founding of the Coptic Church in Egypt and the Coptic papacy under persecution. I would read this book with a critical eye, remembering at all times that the author has his own view of things, which, of course, is perfectly okay, but not definitive when studying this ancient church."
2,one of my least favorite suess books,"I ADORE Dr. Seuss. In fact, I'm pretty sure that his work is the source of a sizeable chunk of my love for language in general, and for poetry. In fact, I think my love for Shakespeare started as a child, with Dr. Suess. This stuff was really profound for me.But I have to say, if Geisel really did write this one, he was NOT in top form. The music of his language is missing - some of the verses are downright clunky, and the usual depth is lost in horrific lines like ""... together we'll trot to some real cool spot and play a few video games.""Maybe he was trying to be contemporary. And some of the illustrations here really ARE wonderful, but I have to say, this Seuss lover (who now spends as much as an hour and a half a day reading the stuff to his own daughter, who love it) finds this one way off the mark."
3,It May Be a Classic...,"Dr. Suess books are classic's. I have never read this book before. As I was reading it with my 3 year old son before bedtime, several times in the book they used the word dumb and stupid. I am fully aware that those words are not ""bad"" words. However my son has picked up on those words (prior to the book) and uses them in a harsh tone of voice as bad words when he is upset that makes them sound worse then they are. So I just try to steer clear of those words in my daily language and also try to limit how much he hears those words in general. (which is a challenge all in it's self because once again they are not ""bad"" words). So I was kinda shocked when I was reading and came across those words (which I didn't read aloud) in a children's book. So I'm not telling you not to buy the book, just a little FYI that those words do appear in the book a couple of different times. I'm sure that in most children it is no big deal to hear those words, but for mine it is."
2,disappointed in Dr. Seuss's word choices...,"We love Dr. Seuss, and our goal is to slowly buy our kids his whole collection. His stories are so engaging and offer really worthwhile themes and lessons for parents to talk about with their children. So when it came time for Christmas, I started looking for the next book to buy, and unfortunately, settled on this one. I realize not everyone is particular about how they speak to their children and what words kids learn, but we try to avoid words like 'stupid' and 'dumb'. This book uses both; those are not concepts I want my three-year-old or one-year-old to learn. Besides the poor language choices, the book seems pointless compared to many of his other books. Definitely disappointed with this book and my hunch is to be more selective in choosing next time!"
5,Excellent,"Not too dark but good enough to work fine in direct sunlight, as you would hope. The frame plastic does not feel to sturdy but is not wobbly and I haven't had any cracks yet. I use the FF case though as I don't trust the plastic frames holding up while in my backpack.The frames look fine though and fit perfectly on my head, although I have a slightly smaller head.The lenses look sick and do a decent job of the ""mirror"" effect.I got these sunglasses because they had a sweet design and they have lived up to expectations in the style and effectiveness department, especially for the great price compared to ""aviators"" or a more expensive brand.5 stars for devilish looks, good sun block, and holding up."
4,feels cheap,they work. the only problem i had with them is that i didnt like the way they sat on my face. it felt like they were really far away especially the bottom part from my cheeks. and they are but its actually a bit of a benifit because you can read stuff easier when you look down. but they do feel cheap mainly because they are so light. i dont doubt that they are relativley easy to break at the bridge but as long as you arent stupid you shouldnt have problems. the lenses also arent a complete mirror finish but it is pretty good. i like the way they make things look.
4,"Great Glasses, didn't fit too well though.","I really have no complains about these glasses, except that they didn't fit me too way. I just have a big head or face or a combination of the two or something. I ended up giving them to a friend because they looked better on her. She said they are the best glasses she ever had for driving because there was no glare what so ever and she could see and it wasn't too dark or anything. She loves them. So yeah, if you have a big head or whatever, you may not want to get them, but they are super as my friend said."
3,small frame,seems like they are for kids small frame but other wise this is a good set amber not smoked so they were a bit bright
3,"I prefer the term ""sedate""","Honestly, this is a well-made game, rock solid gameplay, interesting intro, quality graphics, easy premise, but eventually you'll have to PLAY the game, and that's about the time that you'll be nodding off.It's similar to Crazy Taxi in that you have a certain amount of time to complete your task (collecting coins) and you get points for creatively slamming into other cars and various scenery. The cars handle like Midnight Club, which means ""not that well"" but eventually you will learn to simply brake going into the corners.The rest of the reviewers are right when they say there isn't a lot of slam-bang action and stunts. It's basically puttering around town collecting coins, clocks to extend your time, and nitro boosts. 4 different cities, multiple objectives within those cities, a bunch of different smaller cars, and that's the entire story.If you aren't expecting much, it's a winner."
2,Look elsewhere for speed and fun,"This was the 2nd PS2 game I'd purchased, and I bought it because it looked fun on the back. Unfortunately, it was incredibly boring and I haven't bothered with it much since the first day of getting it home. You start off with ONE car (though they boast of 20 something you can choose from), and it has no speed or handling whatsoever. You do have a free-roam choice so you can scope out the town, but even that becomes tedious after a while. With nothing to do but hit other cars or the occasional outdoor table and chairs, the game gets boring. Fortunately, I purchased Spy Hunter later so I could get a really good driving game. If you have a choice of driving games, then avoid this one at all costs...if someone gives it to you as a gift...well, just trade it in on a good game."
1,this game ...,I rented this game because they didn't have atv and i wanted a 2 player racing game. The graphics are average but the controls and the objectives are the worst i have ever seen in a video game. I swear the car absolutely will not turn until you're almost at a wall and by then its too late. If you try to brake and turn your car comes to a complete halt. And all you did is drive around and get coins. WHOOOPEEE!!!!!
2,...I'd rather be bowling,"First off...It was one of those, ""Looks interesting, I'll give it a shot..."" kinda game purchases. I really could have put that [money] to better use, because this game turned into an expensive coaster for my beer. Its got some nice graphics, but the game play is annoying as all hell. Good luck making a sharp turn in that British bug-looking auto...Certainly not worth the money. This game is a lost cause. Go buy Grand Theft Auto 3...if you already haven't =)"
1,Quite Possibly the Worst Racing Game Ever,"My friends and I recently rented this game, thinking it would be kinda fun. But we were definately let down. The silly little British cars were ok at first, but after awhile I was getting annoyed with driving them and looking at them. The graphics were pretty nice, but trying to control the cars was a nightmare! Even the first car, which is slow as hell, was sliding all over the place when I tried to turn corners. Also, the game is pretty pointless. You drive around picking up coins to unlock new cities to drive in and new cars, and there is absolutely no 'dare devil' aspect in this game at all! Hell, there's no 'top gear' aspect either, because the cars all maybe 50 MPH tops. The only cool thing was bashing through windows and stuff with the car, but that got old after about five times. This game is maybe decent enough for a rental, but is most certainly not worth the cost of purchasing it!"
1,Top Gear Daredevil,"Looks great, but plays like Pac Man without the blue meanies. Basically, you drive collecting coins. That is it. The cars are very slow and the lack of excitement is enhanced by the lame music. Save your money or buy Smugler's Run instead. You will thank me."
4,Great family fun!,"Maybe it's not Nascar Rumble or Gran Turismo 3...but, my kids and I had a great time with the multi-user games (coin grab & bomb grab). We had rented the game, but I will definately buy it. It was fun for the whole family."
2,OK!,This game was ok. The graphics were great But time ran out very fast.The game was not very fun with one car and one track. Don't buy it.
1,Horrible controls,"I think this game is the worst game ever. When I got this game I thought it was going to be awesome from the picture, DON'T BE FOOLED it is horrible the cars always bash into the walls and you go like 5 mph. I think this could be elligible to be the worst game for PS2. No cops chase you either I mean talk about false advertising. If you want a game ge Driver or Drive 2."
2,This Game is OK,When i first got this game i played it for about 60 seconds and said its no good... And put the game up for about two months.. Well i was board the other day so i got the game out and started to play it...Its boring at first but after you start playing the game its fun... You can unlock faster cars.. and earn new paint jobs... Its not the best racing game for the PS2 but its OK...
2,"Not bad, but not good either.","This game is not too bad. The cars are ok, but lame since they are not the real thing. The game play does take getting used to, but once you do, you can do alright. My church has a friday night teen thing, and we rent this for our PS2. I will play it, but I get bored quickly since the game has little change. Coins here, and coins there. I would not recommend you buy this, but if you are trying to kill some time. This will kill some for you."
2,Top Gear Dare Devil,"I think this game is not very exciting and the graphics are just like Playstation graphics. When you are taking the turn it barely even turns, you just hit all the things in your path. The whole game you just collect these coins and it is so boring after a while you just get frusterated and change the game This game is not worth the money and you should look into another game."
1,geez,"what can i say, it's TERRIBLE! all you can do is cruise around, no getting out. the graphics are terrible and so are the cars. i would rate this a 0 star but i had to give it something."
1,NOT WORTH EVEN $5,"If I were to have played this game at an arcade, I would have put in my 50 cents, and THAT would have been too much to spend on this horrible game. The car physics are nowhere near realistic, and makes having any fun nearly impossible. This game has taught me that an impulse buy based on cool cover art is something that should NEVER be done. I thought this was going to be similar to PS1's DRIVER game (which was awesome), but even an 8-year-old wouldn't enjoy this Top Gear Garbage."
1,"You're kidding me, right?","This has to be the worst game ever released for PS2. The graphics are ok, sometimes the tires sink into the pavement. This game is no fun!!! The cars are crappy, cheap, and slow cars. At least they could have included regular cars, you know, not ""Peanut"" or ""Froggy"" as names for cars. And top speed of these are about 45 mph. Honestly, you would have more fun waiting at an intersection of traffic for 30 minutes than playing this game for 30 minutes. Try ""Crazy Taxi"" and ""Need For Speed Underground Hot Pursuit"" if you want good racing andcar games."
1,The jerky controls made us dizzy,"When we first unwrapped this game, we were very excited because of the retro style cars and simplistic game play. Initially, we were very rough with the controls but hoped to improve our driving skills over time. However, after playing for 1/2 hour, we were still tail-spinning and ramming into walls. The controls are non-intuitive (joystick uses only left-right action with slow response times) and the cars are extraordinarily difficult to maneuver (the accelerator is either up or floored...and the car doesn't move forward unless the accelerator is depressed). After an hour or so, we closed our eyes to relieve the nausea and returned to SSX :-)"
3,Required Textbook for ESOL Class,"Even though this text is required for undergrad classes, I don't think it's the best text available. It offers good advice and useful activities, but it focuses mostly on becoming an author in the classroom and not much else. It also doesn't go by chapters, it's mostly divided into units (a little confusing). So I do consider this text helpful, but not the best one available."
3,Not enough of the animal figurines,"Good reference if you are looking to identify dolls, but very few of the dogs, mice, horses, and wildlife the company produced are listed, which included, unfortunately, none of the ones I was looking for. The pictures are very clear and the price guide is easy to follow, however."
2,Not relavent,"This book might be better for someone who is in local sale job or owns a small business. As a professional operations manager, I could not find a lot of use for most of the suggestions in this book. Not saying it is bad book, it just wasn't relevant to what I was looking for. It's not expensive, so if you want to give it a try, even if it doesn't work for you, you're not out a lot of money."
2,Could not get into this book,"I gave it a good try, but when 3/4 of the way through the novel, you aren't sure what the plot or message is, you have to put it down. There isn't a thing wrong wiht the writing - I rather enjoyed the author's voice at times - but good writing wasn't enough to support this one."
2,LONG.,"I really can't say I enjoyed this book. I read Ian Bank's ""The Wasp Factory"" and loved it, so I thought I'd check out ""The Crow Road."" The book seemed VERY long and drawn out... there didn't seem to be much plot at all... I kept wondering when he'd get to the point. I kept thinking it would get better in the next chapter, or the next, and it just never picked up. I also had trouble following some of the slang, but I noticed that the used copy I picked up was apparently a European copy, so that may (or may not) have had something to do with this. I let my mother borrow it (she generally blows through a novel in a day or two) and she couldn't even finish it. I'm not sure how I made it to the end, myself. It was just... dull, and lifeless. I was very disappointed. If you really want to read this book, pick it up at a library, or at a used book store for $1. It isn't worth as much as the shipping I paid for it."
3,"Good book, but it confused me","This book seems to me to be excellent in so many ways, yet it confused me. It reminded me of when a family gets together and everyone tells a story from different times, and somehow in some way it all meshes into family memories, even though it isn't linear or really coherent.The book starts with the really promising (to me) opening ""It was the day my grandmother exploded.."" Well, that just sounds really promising for an interesting read. But somehow, for me, as we learn about the protagonist Prentice, and the background of his family as he grew up, and his search for his missing Uncle Rory, it just didn't work for me. So many people have told me they just LOVE this book, however, that I can't bring myself to be negative. The flaw must be with me.So, I'll say the truth, which is that it was an interesting read, entertaining, not what one would expect, but not for the perhaps shallow reader that I sometimes can be."
2,drifting towards mediocrity,"After an explosion of great novels (Wasp Factory, Walking on Glass, the Bridge), Banks's non-SF fiction began to fade. First came the self-indulgent prog-rock fantasy Espedair Street, then the silly Canal Dreams. With The Crow Road, Banks really drifts into mediocrity. This is a plodding tale of an annoying family with a dark secret that really is too far-fetched to believe. I've been reading all of Banks's works chronologically, and it seems as though he saves all his best ideas for his SF books, leaving the cutesy drudgery to his mainstream fiction. If you are new to Banks, your best bet is to read his earlier works."
2,"It tries to be a lot of things, but fails at most of them.","Read the reviews of Iain Banks and you can't help getting excited to read his stuff. He's a great writer with strong characters, but it's hard to tell what the point of this book is. Is it a mystery? The mystery doesn't develop any suspense and is easily solved. Is it a love story? It's way too predictable and cute. Is it a dark existentialist treatise on the futility of mankind? Well, no, not if everybody who survives falls in love, inherits money and lives happily ever after. I just don't get it."
3,for aspiring Sherlock Holmeses with weak stomachs,"A fair offering from Banks, though The Wasp Factory it is not.A bit of murder mystery, a bit of post-adolescent incestuous romantic comedy while our protagonist wanders in and out of University trying to find himself.I enjoyed it. But not enough to ask Mark to give back my copy."
5,Writer on the Loose,"Stranger on the Loose, D. Harlan Wilson's follow-up to The Kafka Effekt, will cause a literary meltdown in your sanity-cortex if you don't read it with a decent amount of valium and good hit of milk plus. In this book, Wilson maps out the boundaries of a schizopolis, a freakified city in which pumped-up bodybuilders invade people's privacy and antagonize them with their poses; small, hobbitlike elephants pour out of manholes and ransack seemingly docile, sane neighborhoods; restaurant-goers bump off entire staffs of waiters, cooks, bartenders and busboys when they are served human tongues for dinner against their will; intellectual parrots teach frat boys and sorority girls how to read Freud; firemen replace the sirens on their fire engines with screaming yaks; flaneurs impersonating bowling pins search for people to impersonate bowling pins and knock them down. If you like dark comedy, check out the stories in this book - they won't disappoint you. Highly recommended!"
5,My fiance loves his.,"I bought this ring to replace a similar one that my fiance broke. He was really upset about it because I had bought it for him at a Medieval fair that we'd never get back to. Luckily, I found this on Amazon and ordered it. He was thrilled, and glad I didn't pay much for it, despite the original only costing a dollar. I may have a hard time getting him to exchange it for the gold wedding band I'm giving him!"
4,Great buy,"this is his girlfriend and I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. its really smooth, shiny, and great for a guy. it shiped very quickly, that was great. so i tottaly recommend this product to anybody. check it out."
5,Heated matress pad is awesome,"I have always disliked electric blankets, but my wife likes being ""cozy"". This gives much better local distribution of heat, without the possibility of the heated portion of the blanket ending up on me. Love it."
2,Controls poorly conceived - connecting cable barely length of bed,"There are several problems with the controls for this unit. First, the controls that came in our package do not match those in the picture. No big deal, but maybe that explains the problems. More importantly, however, the instructions are wrong. The control with the label on the back is NOT the one that controls the side of the bed with the label. In addition, the cable between the two controls has maybe 4 inches of play in it. Our end tables do not abut the bed -- they are about four inches away. The result is that the controls barely stay on the end tables and, in the event that someone bumps or tries to use one control, the other one necessarily falls on the floor, which in our house also usually takes a cordless phone and a couple of books with it."
1,Doesn't heat up,"I bought this item over a year ago as a gift for my daughter and unfortunately, didn't even take it out of the package until a week ago. She had just moved into a new house and it was the perfect time to put it on her bed. Unfortunately, there was no heat at all. The controls light up when they are plugged in but that is about all.Now I am out all of my money because I am obviously not within the 30 days returnable timeframe. I would not recommend even trying this item.This is the 2nd item I purchased from Amazon for ""warming up a bed"" that has been defective."
2,Lasted Less than a year,My husband bought me this heating blanket/pad for christmas this past year and it's only October and my side has burned out already. I'm not thrilled. I'm hoping I can turn it around and use his side until it burns out before buying a whole new one just for one side.
2,O.K....,"I bought this heated mattress pad to replace my previous one because I have a different size new mattress. I don't like this new one as much as my old one. It seems to take a long time to warm up the bed. Also, the heat is distributed unevenly (purposefully). The bottom of the bed, near the feet, is warmer than the rest. I am short (5'2"") and my feet don't reach the warmest zone.However, the bed does warm up and get cozy."
3,nice and warm,"Liked the pad way better than a ""heated blanket."" Minnesota winters get cold and it was so nice to climb in a warm bed. Didn't get the 5 stars for 2 reasons: We had to order a king size to fit our queen, and one controller broke after a few weeks. We were still able to use it but it would only allow me to set it to ""2"" and if I pushed the button to get warmer it would simply shut off."
1,Controls don't work,"I purchased this heated mattress pad in December for my spare bed...when my son came for Christmas break he used the bed, I noticed that the light would be blinking on the controls in the morning. I'd have to unplug and replug to reset it. At first I thought that it was the automatic shut-off after 10 hours....soon I found that it would quit heating after only an hour or so, and the controller lights would blink until unplugged. Very disappointing, I need to find where I can get replacement controls."
1,Mattress Pad Too Small,Late delivery due to the weather. The mattress pad did not fit king size Temperapedic mattress. The mattress is thicker than standard.
2,Tepid,Not exactly what we had in mind. It barely gets the chill off the sheet.Wouldn't recommend it.
3,Prefer Electric Blanket,"I bought this about 6 months ago. After a month, I decided it was not for me.It worked OK, but needed a heavy blanket to keep my body warm from the cool room air.I replaced it with an electric blanket and now am happy as a clam."
2,Not worth the money,"I've owned a few different mattress pad warmers in the past, but this is by far the lowest in quality. It only has 6 heat settings, and even on high it takes 15-20 minutes to warm up. There are other brands in the same price range that work much better."
5,Great choice,"We are very happy with this item! We turn it on about 5-10 minutes before going to bed and the sheets are nice and warm. It's not a burning heat, just a nice really warm."
5,Warm as Toast!,"We are delighted with our Restwarmer Mattress Pad, even though my husband said he didn't need it and purchased it for me...............I see the little red lights glowing on his side of the bed anyway. He said he is sleeping better and feels that he has less aches upon rising so we haven't even put our flannel sheets on the bed this winter. I just love getting into a warm bed. The quality of the mattress pad is great also."
2,not warm enough,For a bed warmer it is not very warm.....an electric blanket out does this by a long shot...u have to have it turned up to the max...would return it..but already threw out the package it came in.......
3,Merely adequate,"Unless both controls are set at their highest levels, the mattress pad does not warm up sufficiently. Using only one side does not seem to work very well. I would recommend a better pad."
3,Beware of brand,"On 9/26 I order this model/brand (Westpoint Stevens) of mattress pad warmer and was thrilled when it arrived earlier than anticapted. We have been enjoying the pad, so far so good, controls, temperature, etc... so much so that I told my mom I would order her one. I went to look at the mattress pad warmer to get the information off of the label: brand, model number etc. and there to my surprise was a Chatham label not a Westpoint Stevens label, which according to my Amazon order history is what I ordered. After looking into to things I realized Chatham recieved very poor ratings and I HAD ordered Westpoint Stevens...SO BEWARE OF WHAT ARRIVES. I called Amazon to see what I need to do, and I was told that I would be taken care of should something happen. I'll keep you posted should the need arise."
1,A Bad Experience,"Packaging was great. Item was shipped in a very timely manner. We have owned previous heated mattress pads. This one when put on the bed and hooked up didn't work. We tried several times to change the positions of the electric cords into the blanket, but nothing. We returned the item to Amazon."
1,Shorted out on first use...,I don't know who else bought this but I can't imagine what would have happened had we waited to actually get INTO the bed before we turned the thing on...IT FRIED. Then they tried to charge me the postage and handling when I returned the item. They did get that quickly straightened out but it was a very frightening purchase. Always test a product before you risk it on your self or others.
1,Defective from the start,"Purchased the Westpoint Stevens Rest Secure Restwarmer Dual Control Heated Mattress Pad, Queen size for a christmas present. Product was defective from the start. Right controller gives a flashing light indicating a problem. The left controller will only turn the temperature up but unable to turn it down. Have to unplug it to reset. Returning it for a refund as Amazon is out of stock and that is the only option. Very disappointed in this product."
2,"Poor Instructions, Unevenly heated","We bought this after using a similar one from another manufacturer's at our relative's house.First off the instruction does not match the dual zone queen sized pad that we purchased. It showed the controller in reverse orientation and it also recommended to have the connector face downward, if we had followed it to the word we would have sever burns.So the first night I was increasing the heat on my wife's side of the bed, while wondering why my side did not increase in heat.The second night, we figured out why my wife didn't complain about my increase in heat. The pad gets hotter towards the center of the mattress instead of uniformly warming the whole pad.I am not sure if I got a dud or if they are all like this. However if you keep it under the 2nd heat setting the pad works more uniformly. Once you pass the 3rd heating level the pad starts to warm towards the center of the pad."
4,Couldn't live without it!,"I wasnt sure if I should buy an electric blanket or an electric mattress pad, but I decided to try the Rest Secure Restwarmer Mattress Pad, and I'm very glad I did! The pad allows the bed to get toasty warm without being heavy or overly hot. The settings on the pad are easy to use, and there really is a big difference between the heat of the first setting and the fifth! I keep my side of the bed at 5 while my husband turns his down to 1 when he get's into bed. We're both happy! The material that the pad is made out of feels a little cheap and the other reviews about the pad not being very elatic are right, which is why the product didn't recieve 5 stars from me. I do, however, feel that the product is well worth the money and is a toe-saver for New England winters! Try it!"
2,too small for deep mattresses,"I purchased this for my out-of-state parents for the 2010 Christmas. This year (2011) they give it to me and said it never fit their mattress. Sure enough, I tried it on my older sons pillowtop mattress--it didn't fit. My younger sons cheap mattress--it works fine on. My parents had even purchased some sheet clips to help hold it in place, they didn't help! Just a word to the wise! For my Christmas present this year, my husband purchased a Sunbeam dual heat mattress pad for our extra deep king sized bed, and I slept the best last night that I had in years!"
3,Not enuf coils on top,"I got this warmer for my husband after he'd been using an electric blanket, which he, as other reviewers I saw here, said the blanket wasn't warm enuf. He'd used a mattress warmer in the past and loved it. When it went out, I bought him the electric blanket. Decided to go back to the mattress warmer and bought it for him for Christmas. He says it's OK, but not enuf heat at his shoulders and in this case, he thinks the blanket was warmer than the mattress heater. The coils are much further apart on the top and not as many as at the feet area. His feet, where he has the most problem, are very cozy and warm. He hasn't complained about the top part, but he did say they need to put more coils in that area so the entire body can be warm."
1,Bad product,Worked great for half of the season. One side quit completely and the other side will go to the lowest setting only. Between this and the sunbeam garbage I giving up on heating pads pr blankets.
3,dual control heated mattress pad,"The transaction was fine. I was a little disappointed with the item, in that it doesn't fit the mattress real well. Could use deeper corner pockets. Also the controls operate the opposite side of the pad than was stated."
2,Returned blanket - no heat.,"Won't buy the cheaper blanket anymore! Set up as instructions said, (Queen size) and both controllers work (lights) unfortunately there was no heat except warm almost where you plugged the cord into the pad, but did not heat up. Did product refund with Amazon and reordered another brand. This was my first electric blanket and I will pay attention to those product reviews and especially always read the one star reviews first, they were true for this product. Disappointed in Westpoint and poor customer service, did not answer my calls and hard to contact unless you like the answer machine. Amazon was great!"
4,"Pad has worked great for years, wish the controls had hooks","I've got the King size version of this and have happily used it for years.I wish the controls had pockets or hooks or clips so you can hang it on the headboard instead of needing a flat surface to rest them on.As others have pointed out, it's a tight fit vertically (around the edges). If I had a pillow-top mattress, this thing wouldn't stay put because the elastic fitting wouldn't get below the mattress.I found that it gets nice and toasty. I'll turn it to 5 (max) a couple of hours before bed, then leave it at 1 or 2 all night long, or 1 on one side and 2 on the other.The extra heat for your feet is a nice bonus.All in all I'm very happy with my unit, and am buying one for a girlfriend for the holidays."
1,Controlers get a reading of 1 and E. bed does not heat,"My controllers quit working after two days, it worked for one day on both sides, the second day on one side, now the controllers do not work. This thing is garbage."
2,Worked great - last year,"This is our second year using this heated mattress pad. Last year, we loved it. It kept our feet warm and was nice and toasty. This year, the heat output is lower by at least 50%. I do not recommend this product."
1,failure to last even 6 months,"We bought this in February, and by July it was turning itself off, with blinking light on controllers. Could unplug and plug in again to reset, but still malfunctions after an hour or three. I will not buy a Westpoint Stevens product again."
3,WIRES FOR THE BED WARMER,"We have night stands on each of the bed,(Queen size) the controls are only long enough to reach to the edge of the stand and also if don't have an outlet at the head of your bed to plug the cord in to, your going to be walking on the cord.My wife is always cold, so she sleeps all night with the control set on high, she complains that her side of the bed is not warmed up all the way in a half hour"
2,Doesn't Last,"We loved this product when it first arrived; it was delightful to climb into a warm bed on bitter nights. (We live in a 200 year old house with no heat upstairs.)We would turn it on about an hour before bedtime, and turn it off once we got under the covers. It warmed up evenly and never affected our electric bills that we noticed.The only problem that we had at first was that it did not fit tightly on the corners,so occasionally needed re-tucking - no big deal, but after about 10 months, it began heating unevenly. So, we adjusted the settings to compensate. The problem steadily worsened, and now one side barely warms up at all. It is a shame. If it had lasted well, I would consider it one of my favorite purchases."
1,Stopped Working,"The mattress pad started out great but after a couple of weeks, one of the controls started to fail. When it was turned up to full heat it automatically shut off. I thought I'd live with having one side not heating up to full capacity but then it failed completely. Called Amazon customer service knowing I had gone past the return/refund date and they were gracious enough to refund me 80% and free return shipping. I wouldn't chance buying this product again but will try something else through Amazon."
2,Rest Secure Dual heated Mattress Pad,"After unpacking and putting the mattress on our kings size bed, we found that the bottom heating element doesn't work. We only have heat around our knees, not at our feet or up above our knees. Would not recommend this heated mattress pad."
3,not bad but could be better,"prosHeats the feet nicely and I do feel warm with it kept at 1 or 2 all night.I can't feel the wires or the cord. The dual controls are great and they are very easy to use especially when you are half asleep.ConsTakes a long time to heat up, I put on 5 1 hour before bed and it is fine,but if I don't have time to do that I have to put up with a cold bed as it takes around 1 hour to get warm enough.Good for the price though but if you have extra money try and a different pad."
2,Heated Mattress Pad Cover,"It warms fine, however, it arrived with a 2"" x 1/2"" black mark near the head portion and is not large enough to tuck in under the mattress and therefore is constantly bunching up under the sheet."
1,Don't buy it!,This mattress cover did not heat up...only slightly..could very barely feel any heat. Not a martex either. I sent this right back. I do not recommend.
1,One control didn't work,Got the mattress pad and one control did not work after repeated attempts to re plug it in. Am returning it for another brand.
3,Dual Control Queen Mattress Pad,"This is the third electric mattress pad we've owned. The first one we bought from a department store and it lasted about 5 years before it broke (the electric coils on one side shorted out or broke a connection). Then we ordered one of these from Amazon, last January (January 2008). About 10 days ago one of the controls stopped working. So we ordered another one, which arrived yesterday and is now on the bed. It seems to be working fine but it is only a day old. We both love the pad but are disappointed that the heating coils and controls seem to be of poor quality. The last pad only had to work from late January to May, and we only just turned it on again about a week before the control stopped working, so it really hasn't had much use. I do plan to return it to the manufacturer and ask for a replacement; I do have another bed to use it on."
1,Almost no heat!,"The purpose of an electric blanket I thought, was to keep you warm. I ordered this blanket for my wife, she feels the cold and I don't so dual controls work out well. We got the Cal king size - it fits well. that's the positive.....My mistake was to ignore all of the other reviews which stated that this blanket puts out very little heat. ""Very little"" is an understatement. My wife puts it on about three or four HOURS before we go to bed on the maximum setting. Four hours later it has just about taken the chill off the bed. It is so weak, that the bed is cold in the gaps between the luke warm wires in the blanket! ""Luke warm"" is a huge compliment to this turkey.We've switched controllers and tried both sides of the blanket, it's not faulty just poorly designed. Our old Sunbeam could get the bed toasty in fifteen minutes. It's too much hassle to send it back so we'll keep it but if you are looking for a warm bed DO NOT buy this thing, it is useless."
3,Crossed wires,"The instructions were very clear: The controller with the label goes on the same side of the bed as the label on the electric mattress pad. Wrong. After a night of neither one of us being at all happy with this product, I ran a little test. One side off, the other on. Opposite sides of the mattress pad heated up. Once that got straightened out, at least we can enjoy the heat, although even then, the lowest setting is still too warm. If you like a lot of heat, this is the electric mattress pad for you."
5,Fantastic!,"This mattress pad has made us SO HAPPY! We feel great all night long, love having more heat near our feet than our heads, love the dual controls, love that we could turn off the space heater and the humidifier, and love the money we're saving (it uses just 70 watts - less than many light bulbs - instead of 750-1500 watts for even a small space heater)! Some reviewers have complained about feeling the wires; we don't, but maybe that's because we kept our previous (unheated) mattress pad and put it over this one - the result: super cushy AND toasty."
4,"Love it, just wish it had a timer","I have considered plugging it into a programmable outlet timer, but have yet to do so. It will turn itself off after some 10 hours or so, but that seems to be a lot of wasted energy. I just want to be warm for 30 minutes after I crawl into bed - just to take the chill off. My covers are suitable to keep me insulted once I warm up.It does take about 30 minutes to warm up after you turn it on, and keeping the sheet/covers on is the only way to retain the heat produced. Again, a timer would be great - set it to go on 30 min before you go to bed, and stay on for an hour - that would be ideal."
5,Great Value,"I have one, and this one was a gift for daughter-in-law and she loves it. For cold natured people this is a wonderful product - nothing like a toasty bed at nite!"
4,Peace and comfort,This mattress pad really works great. If you don't have a heated blanket this heated pad works just as good.
4,Works well,"The product is good, giving a warm feeling underneath you. It has only 5 settings, but that's enough for most people. Originally, when I put it on the bed, following the instructions, I found the controls were switched. This was because the controller with the label was the wrong one. Obviously switched at the factory. Once I switched the controllers, everything was fine. WE especially like it better than our old blanket, because it would wait for you to get in to start. This one warms the bed right away. I look forward to it next Winter(bought it in spring)."
5,You'll wish you'd done it years ago,"Not too hot, variable dual controls which really don't affect the other person and provides a fabulous night's sleep. I'm not able to sleep until I'm warmed through (but not too hot!) and this was the perfect solution. Good value for money."
1,POOR QUALITY,"This product is already broken as one of the controllers will not function properly. This does not help since it is a cheaper product than the one I ordered and paid for. Now, I have to package and send it somewhere to be fixed."
2,Doesn't fit a thick mattress,"I should have paid attention to the review that said that it does not fita thick mattress. Indeed, it truly does not."
2,Westpoint heated mattress pad.,This item arrived and I was very excited to get it on the bed. I used the pad for a week straight without any problems. I did take the pad off the bed to wash the mattress pad underneath and when I disconnected the cord the prongs came out with the plug. I was able to get a replacement through the company but two weeks later when I went to wash the bedding and the same thing happened again. If you get it don't unplug it but it is a good heating pad when it works.
4,Better design than other mattress pad,"I used to have a mattress pad from Sunbeam. The improvement I see in Rest Secure are: 1) the power cord connector is on the side, instead of on top of the mattress like Sunbeam, which is annoying when you sleep on it. 2) warmer heat zone for the feet, it does get colder that side. 3) the setting control has 2 buttons, 5 levels, Sunbeam has a rotational knob for 10 levels. I have to say buttons looked less sophisticated, but it is easier to manipulate, especially when you are half awake at night."
3,Size matters,"As a ""queen sized"" ""restwarmer"" mattress pad, this item barely fits a basic queen sized mattress of very normal height. Most Queen mattresses available today have a padding of some kind on top that extends the height to as much as 15 inches. This pad will only cover the top of that deeper mattress and, without something to hold it in place will pull off of the corners and not fit well after a few tosses and turns by a sleeper. Heat and setting are typical. Not recommended for the deeper Queen sized mattresses. Should work ok for a thin basic mattress."
4,Sleep warm,"Initially I thought there was something wrong with the warmer because it didn't heat up as quickly as I expected. However, I've learned that if I turn it on about 1/2 hour or so before I go to bed, it is delightful. Then I turn it off for sleeping.The heater doesn't get overly warm, even on the highest setting. It makes it just right to remove the chill and add a bit of warmth to winter beds. Even though my bedroom is quite cool during the winter, this does the job."
4,Wonderful product. Very helpful for a cold home.,"I love this - it keeps the bed toasty. I takes some time to warm up the bed. I turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour. When I get it, it's very nice and I turn it down to 1 or 2. I find if I keep it on 5 all night I roast. I do prefer this product to an electric blanket. It hasn't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills, and it was worth the purchase price.If you have a big pillowtop mattress, the pad doesn't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet. Otherwise, I would have given the product 5 stars."
4,A timely purchase,"When my bed warmer stopped working, it was still very cold in Colorado, and all the queen size warmers were sold. So, this plush bed warmer was purchased and used. I would have given it five stars, but it is a little less warm on the highest setting than I would like. Adequate though."
5,Love it!,I couldn't decide betwen a new electric blanket or a mattress pad. After reading reviews I decided on the Rest Secure mattress pad. Only to find out it was sold out at the web site I had done my research. After much searching I found it on Amazon and got free shipping! I am very happy with it and am glad for my decision. I think I prefer the warmth on my back and feet vs. an electric blanket having the warmth on top of me.
2,A Scam?,"I purchased this CD set for the studio chatter on ""These Eyes"" as mentioned on Amazon's Track Listing. However, this does not exist on CD. The time difference tells a tale between CD version and MP3 version. Maybe you must also buy the MP3 Download to obtain it. It's not a bad CD set, and the sound quality isn't bad. But, hey, Guess Who material wasn't the audiophiles choice. The CD set contains nothing that you haven't heard before."
3,"NOT THE BEST, AUDIO-WISE","I'm not sure what source material was used in this set, but the sound is definitely inferior to the audio on both the three studio Buddha re-release indivdual album CD's from 2000, and the (now defunct)""Ultimate Collection"" 3CD setfrom 1997.When A/B'd against either of the aforementioned discs, it sounds like a cloth is over the speakers, then removed. There is additional detail and clarity in every track on those other CD's that are just not present on this set.So, if you're a real GW fan, be quick: Grab up an ""Ultimate Collection"" set before they all disappear into private collections forever."
5,The whole history,"This is a great career overview, all the best stuff, rarities, 'single' versions of some of the hits, and a good remastering job."
4,Massive but rewarding,"This is a massive work, and some of the parts dealing with the minutiae of English parliamentary ministerial work was heavy-going. But the account of the years after 1930 is full of interest and the two chapters covering the years from 1937 to 1947 are very touching. This book is more defensive of Baldwin than is his authorized biographer, and makes a good case that Baldwin's course in those fateful years from 1933 to 1937 was understandable, tho not prophetic. I felt the way Baldwin was savaged after 1939 was repulsive, especially when one remembers that Labor in those years(1933 to 1937)was calling for disarmament and was rewarded for that extremely short-sighted course by its stunning electoral victory in 1945. I was glad I read this book, albeit it was not the easiest book to read. A momentous and worthwhile book."
4,Not greatest plot ever but pretty intense fighting.,Tony Jaa does it again with his amazing fighting talent. The movie is a little on the dark side but truly delivers action packed fight scenes. Be prepared for gore and blood as some scenes leave you drenched in it. Great fighting!
4,DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LOWER REVIEWS,"LISTEN, THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY LACKS THE CHARM OF THE FIRST MOVIE, HOWEVER, THE STORY AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE MARTIAL ARTS IS GREAT. VERY AUTHENTIC TO THE PERIOD. THE MARTIAL ART COMPETITION FEATURED BELIEVABLE PRACTITIONERS AND REAL MOVES.AS A SECOND GENERATION CERTIFIED BRUCE LEE INSTRUCTOR WHOM STUDIES THE ARTS OF THIS REGION, I CAN TELL YOU ITS A DECENT MOVIE. THE COSTUMING, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND TRAINING WERE VERY GOOD. ESPECIALLY AS A TIME PERIOD PIECE. THINK 300 AT SOME POINTS WITH THE FANTASY AND TONE AND IF YOU LIKED THE BATTLES, YOU WILL LIKE THIS.ONG BAK, THE ORIGINAL IS A CLASSIC, LIKE ""ENTER THE DRAGON"" OR ""36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN"". JUST A MODERN DAY CLASSIC. BUT, FOR VARIETY AND TO SEE TONY JAA'S VERSATILITY, NOT ONLY IN MARTIAL ARTS BUT IN A TIME PERIOD PIECE IT'S REALLY GOOD. PAUL AMATO"
2,Hordes of elephants?,"I was TOTALLY disappointed by this movie ... there were no hordes of elephants, some of the fighting sequences were SO long I found it kind of boring, & what the heck was up with the two ladies that were more animal than human? (perhaps if I had seen the first movie, I might understand what was up with that)There's O-N-E elephant, not hordes of them."
2,Too much violence. Not enough depth,"There is not enough plot to this movie. The writing is too shallow.On the other hand, it's way too much pointless fighting without meaning behind the fights. Therefore, it becomes purely violent and not artistic.Tony Jaa is a great fighter and athlete, but the screen writing needs a lot of work."
2,Ong Bak 2,This movie sucked so bad. I wasted my $19.95 on this movie. Tony Jaa just can't act. The fight scenes were bad too.
2,"Great action scenes, But terrible story and dialog","I became a fan of of Tony Jaa via his first movie, Ong Bak 1. His moves were very original, and is again reflected in Ong Bak 2. Tony's ability to change fighting styles fluidly was great to see, though one can detect that some of his hits didn't have the force/impact. However, if you are into fighting scenes, this would be a great movie.However, I felt disengaged as the story line and dialog was very choppy, and one didn't have a sense of the characters at all. I felt the story/dialog in Ong Bak 1 was much better. Net, while I appreciate fighting scenes (having grown up on kung fu movies during my youth), I felt I wasted time watching this movie."
5,tony jaa's best work yet!!,"this movie was everything i thought it would be and then some. it totally rocked! very well written, directed and acted and the fight choreography was insanely good. i can't wait to see the sequel! by far tony jaa has stepped up into the big game and i think he will be a long time player in the film industry. i highly recomend seeing this movie!!"
5,ONG BAK IS THE KING OF A$$ WHOOPINS.,"If you like to see a good butt kicking, Tony Jaa is the man. This movie is by far a step up in budget and mix martial arts. I LOVE IT."
1,Ugh! What happened to Ong Bak?,"I loved the first Ong Bak, it was amazing. This one was just.. I turned it off about 2/3 of the way through. It was very over-wrought and took itself WAY too seriously. The first one had some humor, and was pretty creative, this one just bored me to death. Ong Bak was like a more brutal version of early Jackie Chan movies in that they had some of that creativity in the fights and it was just entertaining to watch, this thing reminded me of a bad Steven Segal movie. I watched this on XBOX live when they had the before you can see it in theaters thing. Maybe they changed it after that? If so, then maybe I need to try it again."
2,Hollywood please call Tony!...,"This is clearly a Thai film! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line. Mainly at the end. It's like Rambo without the guns. Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses. The costumes were fantastic though. I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa's previous movie ""The Protector""! Now that was amazing. This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers. Perhaps 12-18 years of age? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony! That's gonna be good!..."
2,Yuck...,"I'm really disappointed in this recording. I thought I would enjoy contemporary artists singing hymns. I thought wrong. Here's what is on the CD: Contemporary artists singing hymns in such a stylized fashion that the tune becomes nearly unrecognizable OR contemporary artists singing hymns badly. Why does contemporary have to equal bad singing technique?The only redeeming quality (and the reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 star) about this CD is the song, ""O Lord of Hosts, How Lovely"" sung by Rochelle Hickman, which is GORGEOUS. However, I already own that tune on a Maranatha CD. So there isn't a point to keeping the CD. I'm giving it away in the hope that someone else will enjoy it. I certainly didn't."
4,Great family therapy book,"This book provides a great foundational approach to using play therapy with family counseling work. Beginners will find it especially helpful in navigating the road of integrating family therapy with play therapy.Creative Family Therapy Techniques: Play, Art, and Expressive Activities to Engage Children in Family Sessions"
1,Mighty Bright Replacement Bulbs/2/pkg.,These bulbs didn't last at all. They blew out minutes after I used them in the mighty bulb holder.
1,You dont need it,"I dont see the point in this, the Mighty bright LED light lasts a lifetime because it uses L.E.D. therefore you will not need replacement. Besides that the product photo of this ""replacement bulbs"" show ordinary light bulps, not LED !!!"
4,The Best of the Best,"For lovers of period furniture, this large book is like pressing your face against the candy store window. The Winterthur collection is the legacy of Henry Dupont. For those who haven't made the journey to Delaware, the Winterthur museum is the premier collection of colonial and early American furniture in existence. This exhaustive book focuses on the New England furniture, among the best in the collection. Each of the 225 pieces is shown in a photograph, often with several images of details. Unfortunately, the photographs are all in black and white (except the dust jacket). An average of 2-3 pages of text accompanies each piece. For the student of furniture design or the lover of fine furniture, this book is a treasure."
3,"Not bad, interesting interpretation","I agree with the two posted reviews. The descriptions of the individual flowers ('tracks' aside) are quite good. I'm not in total agreement with how he 'assigned' his 'tracks' - it is quite linear, but he does give you a different perspective that could be helpful when faced with a client to give further possibilities in explaining the nature and possible history to reveal the reasoning behind their behavior- as with everything, don't take his interpretation as law. Trust your own knowledge, experience and intuition.I too really enjoyed the astrology piece, the missing flower for Leo by process of elimination is Vervain.I am looking forward to reading Peter Damian's ""The Twelve Healers of the Zodiac""."
4,Good source for Bach Flower usage,"This book has a really easy way of explaining the usage of Bach Flowers, plus the advantage of including the ""tracts"" which improves the way we treat ourselves or our patients. Is really useful along with the ""Body Maps' book from the same author."
5,I'd give this tenor a tenner!,"As is so often the case with these reader reviews, upon perusing them I can't help but wonder if we were even reading the same book. In this slim but far-reaching volume, Skvorecky carries through his lifelong themes of freedom vs. conscription, will vs. compulsion, and the idea of humanity vs. the humans involved. The stories are short and almost deceptively witty -- because there is a depth of heartbreak beneath. If you favor writers like Klima, Hrabal, and Kundera (although Skvorecky thankfully lacks the latter's pomposity) you'll find ""The Tenor Saxophonist's Story"" well worth reading."
1,Beats No-Doze,High School assignments have been more enjoyable. The translator will also be known by posterity as the translator of the authorized bio of Vaclav Havel {out of print}. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
4,!,"This book was written by LEIGH GREENWOOD and not PAMELA.It's a very good, marriage of convenience---turning to romance--tale. We enjoyed it very much"
5,The Top Resource,"There have been several attempts (ie PT Wong) to put book out of this calibre but editors Reker(Trent Univ,Canada) and Chamberline(Massey Univ. NZ) have succeeded. The volume works because the theory, research and applied sections not only have most of the key people writing about what they know, but the focus is on the use in 'everyday people.' Topics are timely and boldly go where few researchers have gone before ie., aging, Alzheimers/AIDS and religiosity. The editors summarize and offer future directions to this much needed volume."
4,Worth a read,"[....]It is actually a good book and it tells both sides of the story, including the fact that most of the women liked the safety aspect of the ranch. Which required STD HIV testing and had great protection built into the rooms etc so that the women who were basically on contract could know that no jerk could get away with verbal or other types of abuse etc.And it talks about the women who got out of the business because they made the money they wanted, felt they provided a service and then wanted to move on be it to college or other non-sex related jobs.Prostitution is a multi-level industry. The streetwalkers are the junk food level and the call girls and ranch women are the fine dining level.And if anyone thinks the Mustang ranch rules were humiliating [...,the] sad fact is society sees humiliation as acceptable while some here, including myself see it as something that needs to be stopped."
4,"Good, Interesting Read","What began as a medical study on the usage of condoms turned into this book, a anthropological study of life at a brothel. Since pretty much everything in this book was new to me, it was an educational read. Albert tells about the human side of prostitution and makes a case for its legalization in the form of brothels. I'm not sure I buy her argument, but the prostitutes seemed like interesting people."
4,You have to read this book,"I read this book, and it is a very compelling read. One can't help but finish it in a day or two. After reading it, I can't understand how anyone could be in favor of legalizing prostitution. Read page 234 - it kind of sums it up- legalizing it doesn't really make it more palatable for the women, as proponets would suggest."
2,bkb,"This book is to clinical, where I was hoping to hear a wild ride with some crazy kinky things that some of these wemom run into!"
3,An interesting book but ....,"It was an interesting book an eye-opener but could be more intersting if Dr.Alberta would keep all those names and all those political county informations to herself and would write more about the background and characters of the prostitutes. Dr. Alberta sounds very pro-brothel and calles even Mustang ranch a family, which I find absurd!"
2,Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women,"I was disappointed in this book. It is over hyped.As a frequent visitor to Mustang over the years, I found misinformation in this book about the so-called *brothel association* (there really isn't one) and lack of real understanding of the women.Ms. Albert's intent was to study condom use and she never was a sex provider so I suppose I should not have expected her to understand how the women think and feel since she never *walked the walk* herself.I'm a Vietnam Vet and if one has not served in Nam - they simply can't understand or write about it with any authority. The same goes with this book. She should have stayed with a report on condom use instead of making money off the ladies through observation rather than experience and not knowing about something first-hand."
5,Learn What Goes On Behind Closed Doors,"This book is an indept look into the world of one of the most famous brothels of its time. It is a powerful statment of the humanitarian, political, and social aspects of prostitution. Because of the personal tone of the work, one feels as if they are a fly on the wall. The author never attempts to judge, but succeeds in finding a compassionate and understanding attitude. It is an exciting and interesting read, full of humor, irony, and, of course, sex. It is sometimes shocking, other times sad, but the reader is always entertained. You will not be disappointed."
5,A Chance to Enter Another World,"I got this book out of curiosity. Who hasn't wondered why a woman would choose to be a sex worker, what they do all day, and how it all works? This book answered all of my questions matter-of-factly. At the same time the author treated each person she wrote about as a human being."
4,Kam Returns On a Bankrupt Label,"Kam returned on Kamnesia which was a bankrupt label. Still managing to place his heart into the music. Many have not realized that Kam was banned by Nightclub owners, radio stations and some politicians. Since then he has regrouped and is expected to release a CD called the SELF. This CD has music industry insiders buzzing, claiming it to be the best since Tupac's All Eyes On Me. And from what I hear even more radio stations may ban his CD.He has a Website called: HereAfter-Records.com if you want to check out his upcoming movies and information. Kam promises to come back, from an article that I read on neva-again.cjb.net promises to take revenge against the Rap Game. His flaming lyrics will not be compromised - since he is on his OWN record label.Check it out Kam fans and suppoters!"
2,Disapponting,"I've been hearing Kam rap since the mid 90's and I was impressed so when I heard about this album coming out I had to get it. I did and I was not impressed at all. The production isn't that good (Wino does 4 songs, Jazze Pha does 3, and 5 people I never heard of each do 1 song) and he doesn't rap about his usual stuff. ""Wardance"" is the best track on here and a few others are alright (""Godbrotha"" & ""They Like Dat"" w/ Jayo Felony, Dresta, & 2 other cats) but other than that it mainly collects dust for me. I have respect for him and what he's done but he needs something better than this. I would not recommend this album but his ones from '93 & '95 especially, are much better.Watts Up!!!Check all my reviews"
2,Stock footage with New Age music.,"I too enjoy the sound of 50,000 pounds of thrust screaming with the afterburner lit. Unfortunately you will only hear one fly by during the intro of the DVD. The music, while well performed is almost too restful, especially when you see an aviator sitting in the cockpit of an aircraft capable of Mach 2.5. The video quality was a little grainy, mainly because a lot of the footage was shot a long time ago.While some shots were quite unique, most were right from Discover Wings. This is ""nice"" for your aviation collection but not the edge of your seat DVD you might be expecting."
5,one of the best,"Incredible book.One of the few romantic historical novels that you can never forget.Realistic and mesmerizing.The characters are real and you feel their pain, and love deeply."
4,Great research book,"This is not a book to read in a old fashion way. This is research material.There is a lot of important information and concepts in it to be lost if readed as a regular book. Teachers, students and marketing professionals should use them to imporve their work. Looking for some concept and performance measure.In a world that performance is the key for every thing, this book will help to develop the right group of indicators to measure your business or academic research.I always keep mine close."
4,50+ metrics every executive should master,this is very important book. every marketer must read and learn it very well.....
5,A great catalog of Metrics,"One of the problems with Marketing is that it typically has not spent any real time looking at measuring its successes, performance, etc. WhileMarketing Metrics: 50+ Metrics Every Executive Should Masteris a long way from such a holistic text, it does contain a great catalog of metrics, explanations of use an cautions such that a savvy manager could over time construct his own performance management system."
5,VERY COMPLETE,"This is a very complete book on Marketing Metrics. You need to know many marketing concepts from Business, Finance, Operations and other areas. It includes very interesting charts, tables, and figures. The introduction is vey short but interesting. It is hard to find a book on this subject as complete as this one....."
3,ok,"While most of these metrics are true, they are not always relevant. I guess if you use it as a reference, this is a good book and will do fine. But it is not necessarily something that will turn your world upside down with new knowledge."
5,Take a ride on the wilder side of Krynn!,"With 'Warrior's Journey,' Thompson and Cook return quality storytelling to the world of Krynn. The tale of Tol is such that it can be enjoyed by any audience- it does not rely on awkward machinations or convoluted prequels (as do so many current Dragonlance novels). And long-time fans of Dragonlance take heart! We get a glimpse into an oft-mentioned but little-described empire- ancient Ergoth, in all its primitive power."
3,Almost 4 star worthy,"This is a hard one to rate. It's like the first novel of the Kngpriest trilogy. It starts slow but builds steam as it goes along.There should've been parts in this novel to devide Tol's years. In one paragragh he's a kid, then in the next he's ten yrs. older. By the end, you're immersed in these characters' lives as with most DL novels & there's plenty of twists. Certainly good enough to make you want to read book 2."
4,A fascinating study,"Medieval legend conjures exotic images of high-walled castles, tournament fields choked with blazons, armored champions vying for the favor of chaste damsels, and courtly love celebrated by troubadours - not necessarily a pragmatic view if one seeks an accurate portrait of domestic relationships.This work ably exposes the realities of 10-12C marriage (arrangement, dowry, property and inheritance rights, infidelity, grounds for dissolution, spousal obligations, etc), as well as prelates who (not without self-interest) elevate it to a sacramental institution.Though some may lament romantic fantasy, the anecdotal account advanced by the author is even more appealing (the enumeration of penance is especially interesting).Also recommended: the author's `France in the Middle Ages 987-1460' (Hachette 1987; Blackwell 1991). Those seeking historical fiction may also want to try the work of Zoé Oldenbourg (`The World is not Enough,' `The Cornerstone,' `Destiny of Fire')."
4,Blackberry Pearl plastic holster,"Great product; has a slight design flaw that is easily remedied...when you clip your phone in, the control ball gets pushed in, thus selecting items inadvertently on your desktop. The plastic is thick enough that you can use a Dremmel tool or other file to shave a little indentation in it to keep the ball from being depressed when you clip it in. Other than that, it is a great product and I can't live w/out it."
5,Listen up!!!,"I have been a huge fan of the hardcore techno genre (i normally dig the european techno better, tho). Ive been to raves and this CD is THE ALBUM TO GET. I listen to it over and over again. Songs like ""La Galera"" Just blow you away with the deep bass, while songs like track 6 are pleasing and relaxing. This CD will astound you. Just picture thousands of people dancing to it...its perfect!!! A MUST GET"
3,AVeragely entertaining,"This was a pretty passible cd. I've been a techno/dance lover for several years, and I'm always been looking for good mixes, and this cd proved to contain some nice bassy beats. I also have to agree with others and say that the first and ""Galera"" track were amongst my favorite tracks, but after the fifth or sixth track, the quality seems to taper off,and the rest of the songs don't seem to deserve a second listening to. Though it wasn't a complete disappointment, I totally think vol.3 was much better, and after accidentally breaking this 4th volume, let's just say I wasn't too devastated."
1,The ledge is very flimsy.,"mine broke after 1.5 yrs of normal usage.replaced the broken xbrand with cool master R9-NBS-4UAK, and now I can't be happier."
1,Why too expensive?,"Well, I wanted to buy this one, but I look around for more options ... surprice! At Official Site this one cost 79.99USD .... why this cost a lot more ... I will buy from the product's site."
3,weird,"I read the first few pages & couldn't continue...idk, i'm an army wife & enjoy reading other stories, but this one, idk not my favorite"
3,The first Spur winner.,"This book won the 1953 Spur Award for best western novel of the year, the very first Spur Award ever presented. The story is centered on a sheriff in a small town in the West. He has the responsibility of seeing a convicted murderer hanged the following day but has to contend with farmers who are seeking vengence and ranchers who are trying to free the prisoner. In addition, the sheriff is trying to identify the man who had hired the killer. Unfortunately, the main suspect is the man who is engaged to his daughter. The exact time in which the story is set is unclear; but, it has to be after 1892 since the Johnson County War is mentioned. The State could be Wyoming, Nevada, Nebraska, or a few others. It really wasn't mentioned (or even necessary)."
3,ANOTHER SHOW...,"the truth is that TWO AND A HALF MEN without Charlie really turns into a new thing...this is one of the best series EVER, but i really miss Charlie...Alan became another person...Berta become another person...Walden is ok...it's impossible to fill Charlie's spot...Anyway, i hope for better episodes, and that the show don't end, because TWO AND A HALF MEN is undoubtly one of the best series EVER!!!"
1,Do you smell sharks?,I was just curious what they would do to address Charlie Sheen leaving and I missed it on TV so I bought the episode here. Plus I heard there were going to be guest spots by other actors from Chuck Lorre shows.
4,NICE!,"I thought the show was surprisingly good. A little rusty but it flew.I think Ashton proved HE meshes, just wait."
1,Don't blame Auston K....,"This show was amazing with Charlie Sheen and his charcter was important in every episode, but with him gone people are mad. I could only watch 3 episodes until I could bear it no more. I hated Auston's charcter soooooo much. Had does a complete mentally slow person become a millionare? Auston's character wasn't a replacement Charlie like it should have been but instead a new Allan. They didn't change one main character but everyone when Charlie was replaced. Now I don't blame Auston for his horrible character since he is only able to be as good as the charcter is...which is why people say he sucks. His character sucks NOT him, imagine how he feels being a mentally slow millionare who just replaced Charlie Sheen on a very popular sitcom. He has tried his best but the character would be horrible no matter who was playing him.In summary:Auston is trying his best with a horrible charcterThe show is dead without Charlie SheenFind a new TV show to look forward to now"
1,really bad!,"a short conclusion after the first two shows: stupid story, bad jokesi'll stop watching season nine. the real ""two and a half men"" sitcom ends with season eight."
1,STICK A FORK IN IT,"Its well done,turn off the oven.Season 8 is the REAL last season.I have nothing against Ashton but no one can replace Charlie Sheen in this role.He was actually acting out his real life pretty much.The chemistry between the actors are gone with out him too and no where near as funny.Charlies THE MAN and this would of been like taking Al Bundy out of Married with Children and replacing him.Just wouldnt of worked and either does this.At least I got seasons 1-8 on dvd to watch over."
1,Stinks,"What else is there to say. Was great, now stinks. This show would have been better without Walden. The other actors are great, Kutcher sucks."
1,"R.I.P. - ""TAAHM""","Where once stood a funny sitcom about single life, seduction and relationship, which was accompanied with brilliant black humor, sarcasm and funny puns,now stand a rubbish sitcom with a stoned teen, a billionaire without brain and balls ... and Alen, antisocial than ever, accompanied with cheap fart- and penisjokes.And if that does not work, then we show Ashton naked for the umpteenth time. Yes THIS is always funny. :/With the 9th Season ""Charlie Harper"" wasn't the only one who has died.Honestly your money is better spent if you take it, put it into a rocket and shoot it to space.All that's left to do now is to drink, until the part of the brain that creates mental pictures of this season is dead. ;)"
1,The show died with Charlie,"Charlie Sheen is the only reason the show lasted eight seasons. He was the show. Ashton Kutcher is a really bad actor. There is nothing funny about this show now. Its not worth buying or even watching it on TV when its on. I watch the first eight seasons on DVD, they are the best. Even though i have seen them several times, i never get tired of watching them over again. The producers should have Charlies death be a dream that Charlie had and have him wake up from his dream and continue on with the show. It will never be any good without him."
3,STUPID,"CRUDE TITLE, I mean really. Clearly NOT the same show BUT Aston & Jon deliver with what IT offeres THEM.Cant WE get cleaner TITLES PLEASE!"
1,Awful,"I am a big fan of the series and I was terribly disappointed with the recording of this DVD. It would play, stop and go back and start over again. It was a nightmare. Only the part one played straight through out without stopping and repeating itself"
1,"Would give ""ZERO"" if I could",They should have brought Charlie Sheen back as a ghost or something - it is not the same series with Charlie gone!!!
5,2.5 Men,Two and a half Men is agreat series and I love the comedy portrayed. Great prices received in great condition.
5,Great quality,The quality is great (as long as you have a good high speed connection). It was available when I needed it without commercial (this is key as I HATE commercials). I would rather pay (if my DVR missed it for some reason). Not a big fan of the Ashton Kutcher years.
4,"SORRY CHARLIE, ASHTON IS GOOD","No, Ashton Kutcher is not Charlie Sheen, which isn't entirely a bad thing. Still a great show with lots of laughs. Minus one star for turning Charlie & Alan's mother, Evelyn into a lesbian (with Lindsay's mother as her companion), and too many episodes with references to Jake & Eldridge smoking pot. Other than these two missteps, I enjoyed the entire season."
1,This show is dead,why all this nudity and sex content with the new actor !!!!This show is dead and it should be buried.
1,A poor story idea that's gone on far too long,"From season 1 to current, the show is a mess and just awful. Who watches this? I don't know a single person who'd admit to it. Maybe the show should have gone in a different direction to begin with. Two gay dads raising a son. That would have been far more interesting.Sheen is awful, but Kutcher is worse. Is this possible?"
3,Not the same without Sheen.,"The Jon Cryer as a leach/weasel story line has ""jumped the shark"". The show lost something when it lost Sheen, who was basically playing a toned down version of himself."
1,Don't bother,You just don't keep it going like that. Not funny and I hope they cancel it after this one. Ashton kUTCHER IS'nt bad it just does not work.
1,Season Nine starts out as pure Go....Crap,"I made the mistake of watching the first episode of season 10 first so perhaps I was tainted before I saw this episode. I downloaded this one because I was interested in finding out how easy it was to integrate Ashton into Charlie's shadow. The funeral scene seemed more like the writer's were intentionally slamming sheen himself, for revenge or spite because it sure wasn't for humor. Ashton's character is not sympathetic in the least. If I wanted to see pot humor I'd watch old Cheech and Chong movies, at least they're funny. So far, this show sucks but I suppose when you have as much money as a major network, you can throw away money on two or three seasons of pure crap before someone in management realizes the dog they've been feeding."
1,"Wow, this really takes me back","Remember the show Joanie Loves Chachi? Remember how every time Scott Baio came down the stairs wearing a tank-top all the girls in the audience would swoon and go ""Whooooooooooo!!!""? Well, when Kutcher the TV Show Butcher came down them stairs sans beard, all the girls in the audience swooned and went ""Whooooooooooo!!!""This show has officially become this generation's Joanie Loves Chachi. Congratulations America, the last good sit-com has jumped the shark and been Kutchered (I mean butchered). Long live Scott Baio."
4,"Season 9, 2 1/2 Men","I totally disagree with the first reviewer. I thought Ashton Kutcher breathed new life into this series. I liked the interplay between the characters and thought the humor was pretty good for someone stepping into such an established show. Not perfect, but far from deserving one star."
3,Two and a Half Men Has Lost its Sheen,"I confess that I've never been an Ashton Kutcher fan, and even more so. I watch this only because I like keeping up with Alan. The actor who portrays Jake has made comments that people should stop watching the show because of its influence. I don't think that's the real reason to stop watching it."
3,Good Show,I give all movies 3 stars unless they are stellar. You will enjoy watching this movie and it was worth the price paid.
5,Fits like a glove!,"I was such an idiot for not paying more attention to what I bought, I got 52mm filters for a 58mm lens. This little adapter ring did the trick in allowing me to have filters over my lens without getting all new 58mm filters!It also shipped fairly fast and the seller sent me a free lens cloth, hehe."
1,**WARNING-WARNING-WARNING: FAILURE AHEAD!!!***,"Worked fine when NEW..until it failed!!! Like sooooo many others, I thought this was a good value unit,UNTIL it failed Suddenly, it was not recognized by xp, After 3 days wasted researching any solution, I emailed WD. NO RESPONSE I thought all my data and backups were lost until I took case apart, found drive appeared normal, put it in a 3rd party sata-to-usb enclosure. VOILA!! Saved by the competition. Too bad WD paired a terrific drive with a faulty enclosure. Luckily, they have stopped making this train wreck. Avoid the headaches- Buy a good bare drive and a brand enclosure, you will live longer for only a few more bucks!! Should mention this is my 4th Western Digital product to fail..Consider Seagate instead."
4,Breath easy,Give your car or truck a breath of fresh air. These things really do what they say. Just allow about twice the amount of time for installing.
5,What a book,"The book is consie, straight to the ponit. It reliefs you of the need to search a huge vol for a simple information"
1,Not Funk!,"Had I done my due diligence, I would have known that ""Ridin Mighty High"" is a gospel based collection of songs. It does not reach back to the time when Pee Wee played along side the ""godfather"". Beware...this is not ""funk"" nor is the music even ""funky""."
4,"Excellent quality Blu-Ray, not terribly exciting overall","It is a good recording of famous, but in my opinion, second tier, classical ballet. Primely because the music is so low quality: composer Minkus composed music for Russian Imperial Ballet by yards, so the new productions could be made regularly. Also it was still the time when serious composers did not produce music for full length ballets e.g. before Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, etc., before Diaghilev and Balanchine started to use serious music for their productions. Dancing is great, but there is absolutely no chemistry between the stars. Good camera work though."
1,"Started it, blessedly forgot it and tried again.","Amazon doesn't like one word reviews, but this book deserves one. That one word is TRITE. I did not finish Pawn of Prophecy. The characters were one-dimensional and down right boring. If you are going to read a Tolkien pastiche, just read Tolkien."
1,"Once More, Into the Blech",This is just a series of contrivances mashed into a brick of paper.What on earth is everyone thinking? Go read Glen Cook or George R. R. Martin.
5,A door to a great fantasy series from a brilliant author.,Pawn of Prophecy shows that David eddings can build a complete world and set complete characters down in it. The series is never boring and I rushed to get each new book. A masterpiece.
5,I've read the WHOLE series until my books fall apart.,"Characterization is well-developed, no mysticism here, ""real world"" rules observed, a ""scholarly"" work in total, equal to any work P.D. James or Lord Peter Wimsey's creator ever wrote - and both of those writers were scholars in and of their own."
4,Boomer's Favorite,"The Begeraid is the best book I have read in a long while. I am a complete fantasy reader and was expecting this to be good book to begin with, but what I found just blew me away. This book is for everyone because it has adventure, romance, and comedy all in the same interesting and wild story. David Eddings has a way of keeping your attention even during parts that are supposed to be boring. This is still my favorite book, and I still enjoy reading it now. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a spicy story and just wants to escape from the normal predictability of daily life. Enjoy!!"
2,enjoyable but depressingly 1930s-ish female characters,"Ok, so i recently re-read the series and was surprised to see how incredibly weak all the female characters are. 90% of the references are about their looks... even Polgara the Sorceress is awfully prejudiced novel despite having been coauthored by Eddings' wife..Still it is a fun story so long as you don't take it seriously and treat it like a cheap romance novel for 14 year old boys (and their grown up counter parts)."
3,Love the story,"I love this series, but I am not liking the size of this book. It is too big and akward to hold when reading. The only good thing about it really was the price so I will live with it. I really wanted to get these on my kindle but apparently that is never going to happen so I gave up and bought the paper back version (again). Would not reccommend this to my friends."
5,great,love these books there one of the best series I have ever read would recommend to anyone that likes fantasy
4,Replacement copy,"I always liked this series and after losing the books in a move, I felt the need to replace them."
3,"Eddings could have made this good,but it came out cruddy.","The idea was good , it was just where he went with it that was the problem.When the adventure was just abou t getting somewhere , Eddings just had to make the questers go somwhere else ,somewhere that was pointless to go to .Eddings goal is not to make a story ,it's to give the reader a tour of his world."
5,I've read it a few times,"This is one of the better fantasy series I've ever read. The characters are full and believable, and by the end you feel like part of the 'team'. His stories are rich enough to keep you reading, but not bogged down in detail minutia. An excellent series-highly recommended!Durk Simmonsauthor ""Strings of Connection: Book 1 of the Witches in America Series"""
2,poorly written and ultimately uninteresting,"A friend recommended the Belgariad and gave me all five books to check out. He warned me that the writing wasn't great, but that the structure of the particular fantasy world that Eddings created was novel and interesting. Perhaps it is, but I found the writing pretty dull and ended up skimming it pretty quickly after getting about one-third of the way through the book. So, I can't really say much on the coolness of the way the gods work in the Belgariad. I just finished Pawn of Prophecy, and wasn't motivated to spend my time on the rest. I checked out the summaries on Wikipedia to see what happened -- and am glad I didn't waste my time!I can easily see the Belgariad being enjoyable for younger readers, as the Xanth series was for me when I was twelve."
3,second rate fantasy,Although I thoroughly enjoyed this series I feel that Eddings falls short as a leading man in his genre. He oversimplifies everything. I think that he could stand to learn a few things from a one Robert Jordan.
4,"Fun, Simple Read","First, let me mention that this book, which combines books 1 to 3 in one volume, is physically large. I had originally bought this to read while exercising on an elliptical, but it is too bulky for that purpose. Doesn't affect the contents, just when I read it.The writing is engaging and enjoyable. The story line is fairly simple and predictable. The characters are fairly well filled out, although they tend to be stereotypical within each culture depicted in the book.As a previous reviewer had written, one of the nicest things of this series is that it has a definitive ending, and does not drag on forever.I only give the book 4 stars because the plot follows the epic fantasy formula so closely. But still a book well worth picking up to read on the beach or as an escape in the evening. (It helped distract me while I had a cold. Captivating enough to keep my attention even though I wasn't feeling that well, and not so deep that it made me pause and reflect.)"
5,One of the Best,"I just re-read this series after several years and remembered why I loved it. The characters are like old friends, written with warmth, humor, and honest to god human characteristics. Edding's plots are standard fare, but it is his incredible ability to build characters that a reader can connect with that raises this series (and its companion ""The Mallorean"") well above many others in the genre.Budding writers would do well to read Edding's work and pay attention to his handling of point of view throughout the series, and the different voices that he gives each character to make them unique.Once you've finished Edding's series, try some of George R.R. Martin's ""Song of Fire and Ice."" Much darker, however it's focus on character will appeal to any fan of the Belgariad."
4,A great set of books,"Years ago I was browsing a book store and saw 'Pawn of Prophecy' for the first time. I purchased it, walked home and read it that evening. The next day I returned and got the rest of the Belgariad and read then all in just 3 more days. Eddings does a great job of creating a world with its own rules and logic and then letting you discover it. The characters are engaging, the dialog is charming, and the great story is enhanced by smooth writing. When the new compendiums came out I bought them for my own kids as was very pleased to learn that, 20 years later! they are as good as ever. Heartily recommended for romantic teenagers rather than the vampire/werewolf stuff cramming shelves presently."
4,THE sword and sorcery series,"Possibly my favorite series in my high school years, to me, this is the epitome of sword and sorcery.I did always feel that the main downside of this is that there doesn't seem to be a single, truly likable female character in this series. Powerful or headstrong, yes, likable, no.For all the lousy movies Hollywood comes out with, why haven't they made a movie of this yet??? You know Sean Connery is Belgarath, right? A new star could be born with Belgarion. Come on!"
4,I just can't stop reading these books!,"I've been reading Eddings now for nearly 10 years and his ""Garion"" books are by far the best. Truthfully, though, I wouldn't have been as big a fan if I had actually started with the first book. I read Belgarath the Sorcerer first and fell in love with it.The Belgariad may start out a bit slow and you get tired of Garion's bellyaching, but trust me, the series as a whole is exceptional!"
3,If you've read one...,"This is a great series for those who are tired of the seriousness and overdone drama of so many other series, as if the characters never screwed up, much less smiled. That being said, I must warn any unsuspecting soul who decides to read other books by David and Leigh Eddings. The characters names may have changed, but they are the same characters that you met in this series, just in a different time and place. They do the same things, they talk the same, you get the picture. Read this series, read the Mallereon, maybe even read Belgareth the Sorceror and Polagra the Sorceress, but don't make the mistake of reading the others. If you go ahead and do so, on your head so be it."
5,There is something magical about The Belgariad..,"Of all the fantasy novels I have read, The Belgeriad is the only one that I can read over and over again, without getting bored.The story is the standard fare, and nothing ground breaking. It's the normal ""Prophecy"" story, that has an odd rather unique twist. The ""Prophecy"" is an actual living entity, and has a counterpart that is equally powerful and intelligent.This is one of the really great fantasy series of our generation."
3,Entertaining. Period.,"I am totally boggled by the number of comparisons people are making of this series to the Lord of the Rings. To me that's tantamount to comparing a child's Tinker Toy construction to the Brooklyn Bridge. This series is not bad per se, other than the cliches that are rampant. Eddings takes a word (for example, ""blandly"") or a conversation style (""I liked that"" ""I thought you might"") and uses them repeatedly. The story itself has an interesting premise. The delivery is too fluffy and predictable. I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone over 12."
2,Nothing inherently wrong with the writing but....,"I read some good reviews of this series and thought it might be worth checking out. There is nothing horrible about the writing. The storyline is interesting, though a bit of a cliche. The problem with the books (I only read the first two) is that every character is a stereotype. All Drasnians are cunning and secretive, all Chereks are big brutes who get drunk and like to fight, all Murgos are bad etc. etc. No one in the books seem to have a free thought apart from where they are from. There is nothing inherently bad about the writing, but I found the shallow stereotypical characters mundane and a little disturbing. But if you can read the books without actually thinking about what you are reading than go for it."
3,Pleasant Enough,"I'm not much for long reviews these days so here it is, short and sweet.When I first began this series, I was somewhat put off by the lack of anything substantial ever happening. The entire first trilogy consists mostly of the band of heroes wandering about diverse lands. We do see some development of characters here but that's about it. It is well-written enough, and the characters are interesting enough, which makes up for the lack of action. This book is almost more like a slice-of-life novel than a fantasy adventure. Obviously, there is a place for such books, judging by the reviews, but if you are one who likes ""hard core"" fantasy, with lots of dreaded, foul characters and brilliant heroes, this series may seem a bit mundane. I found it pleasant enough, however, to keep reading."
4,"Good, but not great","First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed all of Edding's books that I have read. However, they are not the most original or well-written books that I have ever read. In fact, I found it suprisingly refreshing to encounter a writer who doesn't write that well and yet still entertains me."
2,"Some superficial fun, but...","Prophecies, Voices of Prophecies, Gods, and Seers; these are the driving force in the Belgariad/Malloreon story, while the main characters are merely instruments and have little degree of freedom. If you can ignore this major problem, you may enjoy this story a little."
5,Awesome possum man!,"I promise, these books were the reason why I love to read! As a kid, I really hated to read, but after stumbling on the ""Pawn of Prophecy"" I was thrown into this world with wonderful characters and great settings. I've enjoyed reading a good majority of his books, and although some may think his caliber of writing has decreased, he is still awesome! I even got my sister into reading because of his books! I really love these books."
5,Held my goldfish like attention.,I have a real hard time sitting down to read books as a whole. I usually get part way through them and then give up because I don't have the patience or the plot isn't cruising along like I want it to. This book and volume 2 both held my attention and did it with class. I couldn't put either book down and was very pleased with it overall. It was actually recommended to me on a message board and after having read it and vol2. I am happy it was recommended to me.
5,Marvelous Contribution to Epic Fantasy!,David Eddings is the BEST! the Belgariad shows the true essence of a wonderful epic fantasy series! this saga telling the life of Garion is really fantastic if your into all the magician and sorceror stuff! it's a MUST read!
1,The worst building experience ever,"I've been building with Legos since I was 7 and everything always fit the way it was supposed to. I tried Mega Blocks a few years ago and they were OK. But these X-Blocks are inferior by far. I followed the instructions to the letter. The engineering of this molding process creates gaps and puckers with every flat block. Nothing lines up the way it's meant to and therefore, nothing stays together! Parts constantly pop off for no reason. I know this is the Hulk 'Destructor' set, but it should hold together while building it. They obviously spent their money on marketing and box design, not on the actual product in the box."
4,Where does garbage go?,If you are interested in tracing the tracks of your garbage this book is for you. What can we do with our garbage. THis book helps to figure it out.
5,Read it!,"This book is actually a real page turner. It's changed the way I think about so many ordinary and mundane things, like recycling a beer can, throwing out leftovers, or flushing the toilet.What happens with landfill? What did people used to do with trash? How filthy is the Gowanus Canal really? All these questions and more are answered in this book. There's even a feeling of adventure at times, as the author follows her waste and is not always warmly welcomed.This book also had the interesting effect on me, of making me care more about the waste I produce (and the world),but also made me feel like I don't need to be too uptight about it, or feel too guilty about my imperfections. Municipal waste apparently only accounts for about 2% of our countries solid waste, the rest is mostly industrial. But, don't let that make you lazy."
3,On the Secret Trail of Trash...Especially in New York,"Ms. Royte wants to know where her garbage ends up. She is able to follow her trash...up to a point, similar to how I was able to stay tuned into her first person narrative...to a point. There are interesting tidbits (landfill terminology [leachate, anyone?], the tidbit that more people recycle than vote, the fact that 125 years ago kitchen trash didn't exist, etc.), but overall I felt weighted down by the continual need to shove everything on the page. Slow reading, very slow."
5,A must read for those who throw away trash... EVERYONE!,"Garbage Land is a well researched look into the world of waste handling. The book not only deals with garbage sent to landfills but also recycling both in the US and around the world.Truly and eye opening book that changed the way that I lived and felt about the world.An amazing book, now at an amazing price."
4,Garbage Land Is A Keeper,"What a great, quirky book. I have worked in the Waste Management field for a number of years, and Ms. Royte got it right with this book. I liked the way she personalized her own waste-generating impact by riding along with the trash collectors. I also appreciated the anecdotal nature of much of the book, which kept it from being too serious."
5,Excellent first-person account...,"...of how we are screwing up our planet. Her use-less-buy-less-make-less conclusions are very sound and well supported by her findings. Trouble is, US society isn't likely to follow that prescription any time soon. She leaves us with the moral alternative of changing our own lives."
4,Who knew garbage could be so interesting?!,"This book is an interesting, in-depth look at what exactly happens to garbage after you do your part in throwing it out. While I never thought this was a subject I would be interested in, I gave it a shot and found it fascinating!! Royte is a strong reporter and researcher, as well as a good writer. I recommend this book for any who has ever wondered ""where does it all go?"" And for a comedic angle on the subject of trash, check out Robert Gussin's ""Trash Talk,"" a funny, fictional account of an environmental meeting overrun with professional athletes."
2,Eyeless in Gaza,"Hey! I gave Elizbeth Royte's book 5 stars (not 2)! The secret wonders she works in this book! Elizabeth Royte is a transformative writer, an unassuming genius who wings hers way over the jellied mundane, putrefyingly prosaic, definitively overlooked, commonly rejected stuff on earth, your dear garbage. She takes us on a grand reverse journey to rejected digesters and backs up to smelly sodden transfer stations, and we are magically rewound, swathed in strange new currents. I was surprised by my own puddled reflection, puzzling in an oily rainbow shimmer. When she asked, What can we recover? What can be reclaimed? Who will redeem the Land? I wanted to answer her Powerful questions."
2,Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. It is perhaps because the book got such good ratings, I was expecting much more than it delivered. I am no expert on the waste industry but I didn't learn much more about it than what I already learned while watching a 20 minute segment on one of those news magazine shows years earlier. If you're interested in learning the nitty-gritty details behind the trash industry, you might want to read this book. However, if you already have a basic knowledge of what happends to trash once it leaves your front step, you might want to forgo reading this book."
4,Locking the garbage can lid after the sanitation truck picked up the trash,"Usually I wouldn't post a review here when 58 people have already written about the book, as every remark I could make has already been made. But I post this brief comment to say Elizabeth Royte's GARBAGE LAND: ON THE SECRET TRAIL OF TRASH reminds us of the inconvenient truth about our environment. Reduce, reuse, and recycle, but to that I add ban plastic (and maybe all chemical-spewing industry as well) and make zero population growth the law if only to stall the coming day when there is nowhere to turn without facing the consequences of what humanity has done to its air, water, and soil.Read GARBAGE LAND."
2,Recycle this Book!,"Ms. Royte style lacks the irony and the sharpened sarcasm the subject demands. She quickly establishes that: 1) Americans are wasteful; 2) People in the trash hauling industry might be (horrors!) corrupt; 3) The recycling folks might not be much better; 4) Garbage has alway been a problem; 4) There are no easy answers. A four minute report on ""All Things Considered"" could have told me the same things, and no trees would have died in the telling.Throughout my reading, I felt this sneaking feeling that the author really wanted to write a book, and all the good subjects were taken. Hey, Sullivan just did one on Rats, and somebody covered the history of screwdrivers a couple of years ago, so Ms. Royte got left holding the ol' literary Hefty bag.Not real illuminating, not real entertaining -- like the cabbage leaves on my compost pile, just sort of droopy and lifeless and there."
4,garbageland,Pretty good book. Not sure I would have chose it had I not needed it for a college course. But definitly worth the price if your curiosity on where your garbage goes
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"This book doesn't even deserve one star. All it consists of is Royte complaining. Waste of my time!!! Her facts seem off, and she has a strong liberal bias."
1,poorly researched,"I found this book to be a very poorly researched, and equally poorly written look at garbage...A very cursory examination of its topic...there are much better books out there than this one"
5,The Nancy Drew of Trash,"This book is a surprisingly enjoyable page-turner, as the author dives head first into the landfills, compost heaps and recycling plants that hide behind the curtain of society. From the very beginning, Royte brings to life the surprising landscape of waste, sneaking through gaps in fences and kayaking through forbidden waterways. This book also answers many of the questions I've had about my own waste habits--composter or disposal? Tissues in the garbage, or tissues in the toilet? A great read, and news you can use."
5,Son now practices without constant nagging.,"Before buying this product at his teacher's coaxing, I had to nag my son to practice. Now he'll practice 5 days a week without any nagging on my part. I would recommend this product to anyone."
2,Quite tedious,"I have played this game three times, and have never enjoyed it once. The first turns take too long as the game sets up a string of opposing sides to start. After the mindless die-rolling, it turns into a game of supplies and reinforcements.Not for amateur or first-time players. I found, without a sound strategy, the Allies are overrun too easily.The pieces look nice, board looks neat, but clustered at the beginning. The rules had to be referred back to constantly, since none of the gameplay was very intuitive."
3,Challenging game,This game is by no means for beginners. It will take the truly dedicated Axis & Allies fan time to sort through the operation of the game.
4,"Gives easier understanding of Jesus, than most authors.","Not much to say, but having all the three men write the book, together, it gives more meaning to the Word of God than many writers, out there, like many well knowns. The book keeps it so simple, in understanding some truths of life."
1,"Poorly written, and the content may be even be worse than the writing.","Read this book for a NGM mentoring assignment. Had high hopes based on the title. Not only is the book very poorly written, the content is really lacking substance. I cannot think of anyone, under any circumstances, that I would recommend to read this book."
3,BORING,"This book is very informative, yet boring. My professor also believes that the author is opinionated, thereby leading to a biased account of Latin American history. However, after reading the material I felt that I had learned something and felt knowlegable about the subject. If you can get through the sometimes boring reading, you will be well-informed and prepared for history tests. :-)"
5,The best thing this summer,"This is a great album, my friends and I all purchased a copy of this at a live show, and we were blown away. California and Sixteens gone are my personal favorite, but it is definately one of those CD's that I like play all the way through.Having seen the band live, it is refreshing to hear the album that captures the great live sound and is not overdone in the studio.Great buy."
4,Welcome to My World,"Item satisfactory and as described. There isn't anything more I need to say to address this specific, or other specific issues"
3,Welcome To My World,"""Welcome to My World"" by Daniel O'Donnell I ordered this CD for my Mom. She must really like it. I can't say that I'm much of a fan of his."
5,Tribute to Jim Reeves,"I salute Daniel O'Donnell for tackling this project on the 40th anniversary of Jim Reeves' passing. Jim Reeves had an incomparable voice that no one could hope to match. His smooth style earned him worldwide fame and his music is timeless. Daniel also has a smooth, gentle approach that works very well on most of the selections. He's most effective on some of the lesser known hits, such as It Hurts So Much, How Can I Write On Paper, Is It Really Over, and others. 2 of Jim Reeves' biggest sellers - He'll Have To Go and Welcome To My World just can't compare with Jim's rich baritone. Even so, this is a worthy compilation that is a welcome addition to any collection of fine music."
4,"Readable, personable, candid.",I enjoyed reading this personal memoir of Rabin and his wife's life together. I liked the first half of the book better than the second half. It is tragic that the peace Rabin sought and finally signed did not last very long.
4,Great study guide!,I purchased this study guide many years ago (2005?) when I prepped for my mammo test and it definitely did the trick! Appleton & Lange have all kinds of great study materials. I love the CD-Rom with practice tests! That's the best way to learn in my opinion!
2,Do not get this book!!!!!,"I bought this book to prepare for my mammo boards, knowing the radiography one had some errors but the amount of errors in this one is ridiculous. I am looking to find another book so that I dont fail my boards. If you do get it double check your answers and dont rely on the practice test answers because they are wrong 50% of the time!!!!"
3,"Good format, watch the answers carefully.","Overall, the review questions were helpful, but there are several mistakes in this book. Some of the mistakes seemed to be poor proof reading, but many other questions/answers seem to directly contradict the text in the same book. That can be very confusing."
4,Fabulous.,"Good live albums are hard to come by;some suffer from poor techical production,while others are mere greatest hits collections with the occasional drum solo;even when all is good,the singer runs out of voice murdering the songs.This is not the case here:for a live album,this is almost too good to be true-Ronnie in top vocal shape offers a treat to his fans,also spanning his career in Rainbow and Sabbath,while Tracy G.'s super heavy chops fit the material extremely well."
3,Accurate but lacking warmth,"As a fan and friend of the late Jane Froman, I found Ms. Stone's book factually accurate and researched thoroughly. As I had lost touch with Ms. Froman, I was pleased to learn about her retirement years and sad to learn how ill she had become. My only adverse comments is the tone of the book. Jane Froman was a kind, compassionate, warm human being that only one having known her could capture the essence of her personality and character on paper. I feel that ""Jane Froman: Missouri's First Lady of Song"" is a wonderful research essay, great for public libraries, but does not capture Ms. Froman's personality. But at any rate, I'm happy that after all these years. there is something concise in book form for Jane Froman admirers to read and own. Thank you, Ms. Stone."
5,Fantastic Artist,"I found the book to be informative and give more information then I had found in the past in regards to Ms. Froman. She was such a great entertainer, I wish there were more information to share about her life. Her recordings are breath taking - such a wonderful person and artist."
4,Fast shipment,"Item was older than I expected, but it may be the newest printing. I don't know. It came very quickly and in good condition."
3,"Better than Kenmore's pet hair tool, but not by much","This one kept chugging along, unlike Kenmore's similar tool that quit, but most of the fur wrapped around the brushes and as it did so the tool slowed down. When I thought I had all the cat fur vacuummed up I tried a test with one of the manual rubber brush tools and was disappointed to find that the Hoover tool had left lots and lots of fur behind. It was tedious getting it all cleared out as it had collected in the turbines too. For my nickel, you're better off using a cheaper rubber brush tool, or masking tape."
2,Overheats easily,"This blow dryer overheats with 10 minutes use. If you turn it off, it won't turn on again until it has time to cool down. I returned it and purchased the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer instead. It works really well."
2,Overheats,"Loved the dryer for the first 3 days. Fluffy, shiny straight hair! Then it tripped the GFI because it overheated. Refused to work for 15 minutes. I had to send it back. Very disappointed!"
3,NOT QUIET,I bought this hair dryer for my mom for Christmas hoping that it was going to be a quiet dryer as the description says.....but think again! Quiet Ionic is definitely not a good name for this product!
2,"When hot and shut off, won't turn on.","My wife is on her second one of these. I initially bought it because I wanted her to use a quieter hair dryer in the morning (yes, selfish). However, both hair dryers will not turn back on again once shut off after using it for a short period of time (she has shoulder length fairly straight hair). It is very quiet, and works well when it runs, but it isn't worth having to wait for it to cool down to turn on again."
4,Super light and quiet,"This hair dryer actually is quite lighter than my old one. Very quiet, as advertised which is such a relief from my old noisy high pitched dryer. It actually seems to dry my hair faster too, which I'm not sure is an illustion or not...I did experience a funny smell the first few times I used it but it has since gone away and I have absolutely no problems with this product. Great product, great price. I didn't give it a full 5 stars just because I never give anything the full perfect rating."
5,GREAT HAIR DRYER!!,This hair dryer is everything it says! I even used it to dry a newly hatched chick and the noise did not seem to bother the chick!It is light and easy to use plus it dries my thick hair quickly.
3,it's okay,"i love that it's quiet. but when i'm done using it, it smells like something is burning. i hate that."
2,Lightweight and rusts quickly,"This product feels kind of cheap and lightweight, but it was the perfect size for making mini-quiches so I gave it a try.I washed it and left it to dry on the dishrack. I came back later to find it was rusting! I thought that tin was not supposed to rust...I scrubbed off the rust and used the pan successfully, but even after washing and hand-drying it continued to rust quite badly. I tossed it out and bought a heavy-duty nonstick Chicago Metallic version. Amazon sells it here:Chicago Metallic Professional Nonstick 24-Cup Mini-Muffin Pan. No fuss, no rust!"
5,Great for bake sales or class treats!,"We love this Mini Muffin pan because it makes a full 24 mini cupcakes. We've used it to make bake sale goodies, and class treats. When we need something with a little more ""grown up"" flair, we get creative with the ingredients and the decorating."
3,Perfect for sorting small parts,"I bought this pan to sort small parts when I work on things such as cameras and laptops. It is great for this purpose, but I would not recommend it for baking as the nonstick surface seems to be very thin and will likely come off quickly."
3,Just OK,"My biggest complaint would be the store bought mini muffin papers do not fit comfortably in this tin. Otherwise, for $8, it's just OK :)"
1,cheap and rough finish,"came dented, bent, dirty or rusty I can't tell. Very disappointed in the quality of this product, this is another one I wish I had held before I purchased, there were many to choose from at this price point and I don't think I chose well."
4,Good Value for Money,"I found this set to be well worth its cost. The pots are quite sturdy, not very heavy and not very light either - cleanup is a breeze. My only problem is that I wanted a 4 qt. saucepan. Excellent starter set!!"
4,Excellent value set,"This set has passed my expectations and then some. I was a bit skeptical because of the low price, but upon inspection, the mirror finish inside and out is close to sets costing much more, and the handles are oven proof and riveted strongly on every piece. Very pleased"
2,Had something similar (larger set) and they sucked,"I got a larger set of these pots and pans. The skillet warped when I tossed a cold piece of meat in it, the nylon utensils are peeling and melting bit by bit, they cook very hot and burned lots of things until I got used to them, but the hollow handles also get very hot. Have to use potholders for them. The other pans are okay compared to the skillet, but I would rather have saved my mother-in-law the money and gotten a set of thick Chefmate pots and pans like my sisters."
2,Poor glass lids,"I have been using this cookware for a short while until one day I opened my dishwasher to take off the dishes and I found that the glass lids of the pots of this brand were all shattered, the glass was all over everything and because of this I had to change my dishwasher. Poor quality?...."
5,This is an Excellent Book!,"Dr. Otazo provides readers with an effective road map to both attain and keep a successful career. Regardless of an individual's career goals or current position, this book will benefit anyone who reads it and puts these principles into practice. If you care about your career, you need to invest in this excellent, well-written book."
4,Pretty good device,"Two years ago I was having an Achilles problem and bought one of these; worked pretty well. I wore it for a year for walking and cycling while my tendon healed. Then my heel felt better and the Pro-Tec was showing signs of wear, soI tossed it. Now, another year later, my tendinitis has returned and here I am back at Amazon buying another Pro-Tec.This product will not make Achilles tendinitis heal quicker, but it will provide enough support to let you continue (in my case) low-impact activities."
5,tendon supports,My husband has a pair of these he wears for basketball. Only problem is they were falling apart. Found these and now he is really happy and feet feel great playing
1,Not so helpful for me,"I have calcific tendonosis in both Achilles and after much research, I bought these with high hopes. I wore them religiously for over 4 months with NO change whatsoever. Tried with and without heel cups in my hiking boots, running shoes (I don't run, though)...even tried them with my Teva sandals this summer. No go. We're now moving on to night-time heel splints, Tramadol and Lido-derm patches. I had high hopes for these tendon supports...and for those that think that (or have been told) being heavy causes this, no, not so much. I had gastric bypass and have lost over 80 pounds since trying these out. Still no go."
