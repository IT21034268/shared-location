3,Are you sure you want the jumbo?,"I've had this unit for several years and just went back to the family size grill for our family of 4. We're trying to eat healthier, smaller portions and, being the ""kitchen manager,"" I decided the jumbo size just wasn't worth the trouble anymore. I'm giving it 3 stars here because not only did the nonstick coating wear off a little too soon to suit me, but the power cord got hot (which always worried me), and perhaps the biggest disappointment was that the lid would not fully open under any of my kitchen cabinets. The unit is that large. I could only use this grill on my kitchen island. You probably won't want to leave it out (because it's so big), but then it's not easy to store either for the same reason. Just be sure you really want/need this large size if you're going for this grill. I do love the Foreman grills but this one was just a bit too large to be a convenient kitchen appliance."
1,It's not a grill---It's a steamer!,"Yuck! Everything I cook on this thing tastes like I steamed it...flavorless, dried out, sometimes rubbery. It is NOT grilling. Waste of money....I gave mine away...I HATED it."
2,"Do not call it ""Grill""!","The only advantage is that the food cooks really fast. The problem is that the food doesn't taste like food made on a grill, it tastes like food cooked in the oven. The flavor of the meat is differenet from the meat cooked outside on the grill. It's still is very tasty, it's just not grilled food. I do not need the grill that cookes like regular oven!"
1,Shipping,"Item was to ship with in 24 hours I ordered it on the 4th & here it is the 7th and it doesn't show as being shipped, so I'm not very pleased because I ordered it so I would get it by Christmas, not sure if it will get here in time."
4,User for over a year,"Our family has had great luck with this product. We use it for shrimp, salmon, medallions of pork, etc. Cleanup is ok if you run water over the griddle immediately, after unplugging, of course. Our Weber Genesis was down for a while, and this was a great substitute. I even lent it to a friend who was in between grills her family loved it, too: but when she bought another model Foreman her results were less than expected. We are fairly light users of it, but think it works great."
3,George Foreman GR36CB Jumbo Size Plus Grill with Cookbook,"The size of this grill is great, but makes it hard to clean. For that reason, I went back to my smaller George Forman grill and gave this one away."
3,"Great Grill, needs only two things.","I really like, and use, my grill. It could be better, if it had an on-off switch and a temperature control. I really do not like plugging and unplugging it to turn it on and off."
4,Okay for those who can't barbecue,"I bought this unit because I live in an apartment and my neighbors (and fire department)would frown on my barbecuing inside my livingroom. It's okay for most double griddle situations (it's really not a grill at all) such as ham steaks, flat fish and chops. It is faily easy to clean, and the savvy chef can use the drippings to use as a glaze or gravy. It is VERY FAST. I cooked a frozen sea bass filet (0.5 inch thick)in under six minutes. Most meat, fish and poultry have retained their moisture content. It is excellent for frozen hamburger patties.On the downside the heat and timer units are fairly clunky and the indicator labels wear off easily. It does not grill in the sense of the word, and therefore does not recreate the taste of a true barbecue. Think of it as a griddle, equal heat top and bottom, like a waffle iron."
2,Good grill with some drawbacks,"I've had my grill for over 6 months now. I like the way it cooks foods quickly but it has a few drawbacks that I think reduce its overall ratingPros:1. For the most part cooks quickly and pretty evenly2. Comes with a decent receipe bookCons:1. No on/off switch. You have to plug and unplug to power it off or on. There is a power light to show when it's on.2. No temperature control and no temperature indicator3. Grill is not removable for cleaning - even with a ""non-stick"" surface and a spray on non-stick things still seem to stick to it pretty agressively and require a pretty good scrubbing to remove. The non-stick surface also seems poorly bound to the grill so the life of the grill may be shortened since it can't be replaced.I like the concept but the execution is slightly lacking - if they made these improvements I would buy another one."
3,'SMOKIN! [for real .........],"WELL Folks - this is kind of a ""Review in Progress"" with updates following the progressof this quite remarkable machine - once hooked you just gotta use it, clean convenient, basically smokeless, and quite safe for adults - don't let the kiddies near it though [speaks for itself]. AND clean-up is a cinch ~ simplicity.BUT - after about 8 weeks of fairly constant use - 3 to 4 times per week, it 'seems' to take just a little longer to 'fire-up' - the thermostat is now audible - one can hear the elements clicking .......... and then there's the 'shell discoloration' Yep! Although 'smokeless' the once pristine outer shell is beginning to yellow - around the edges - especially the top.SO updates will follow ...... not sure about the longevity of this babe....."
3,Good but hard to clean,I like it but its a little hard to clean. I think this item is a standerd have in your kitchen item.
1,Wire Burn Out / Fire Hazard,This item was purchased just 6 months ago. It worked fine till now. The main wire to the thermostat burned out rendering the unit useless and creating a fire hazard due to the arcing of the burned out wire! This is not a safe product to use & replacement parts are difficult if at all possible to obtain.
1,George Forman GR36CB,"This is our second George F grill. The first one burned out after about 5 years. We liked but could not get the same size so we got this one. It was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! After less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat (spade conn.) just fell apart. Being the handy man that I am, I fixed it. Today (9/6/2005) it burned out again. This grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled. It is a piece of junk. We will replace it with a different brand. Thanks for nothing George."
2,Died after 6 months,"I'd give the Foreman grill 3 stars for function and 1 star for durability... We used it 4-5 times a week for 6 months and it died. The only thing that I didn't like about the functionality was the lack of heat control; the one-temperature fits all setting doesn't fit every kind of food. Thick foods were often charred on the outside and barely cooked on the inside. Fat/grease/juices would often follow the curve of the design rather than drip into the drip pan leaving the unit and counter rather nasty. That said... burgers (we like them medium rare), bacon, pre-cooked sausages, most fish, and vegetables were all cooked nicely. If only it was more durable..."
5,Cleaning's a snap.....,"...as long as you do it while the grill is still warm. I use ours 3 or 4 times a week and I use lots of those bottled marinades. As you all know, those are full of sugar and quickly become a burned-on sticky mess. But, I've found that I can take a damp paper towel or sponge and just wipe everything right off. If I do let the grill cool down, then I just plug it back in for a minute to re-heat it before I clean it. For really thick clean up, just drizzle a little water from the sponge onto the burned food. It will sizzle up and wipe right off. I've had this since Christmas and haven't had any problem with the non-stick finish lifting off. I can honestly say that if something happened to mine, I'd replace it the same day...I use it that much."
1,no stick peeling off,"love cooking on it,but we've had it a month and the non stick is coming off...easy way to clean.. after it has cooled lay a wet dishrag in it and close the top,walk away.... the whole mess will just wipe right off ( even if you don't clean it till the next day)"
3,Good indoor grill,"Good grill to cook alamost anything, burgers, hot-dogs, fish, chicken. For steaks though I use a cast iron pan because because of the limited temperature of the George Foreman's grill."
3,George--Why?,The grill cooks well. It is a little hard to clean.The main problem with it is that the non-stick coating completely wore off the grids on the bottom in less than 3 weeks of fairly steady use. Nothing was used to clean them except the plastic scraper included with the grill and a soft sponge or dishcloth.Now the non-stick coating is wearing off the top grids and on the bottom is wearing off the channels. I have used this grill for less than a year and have been very careful cleaning it and I do think it should stand up better than this
5,Very nice.,"My husband bought this grill for me for my birthday. I marinaded some chicken breasts in Teriyaki sauce and then grilled. They were very moist. Cooked in 8 minutes. I had to cut one in half to see if it was done all the way, because I couldn't believe it. The only thing I have to say about the cleaning , is with that type of marinade it did burn and stick on the grill. I used a warm soapy dish cloth and it did come off pretty well. It says you can use a plastic scratcher. That would probably have worked pretty well. Over all I think it is very nice and quick. There is very little smoke that comes from it. I would definately recommend it."
3,"Terrific concept, but","This was my 3rd George Foreman Grill. Each time I purchased a larger one. The grill is perfect in cooking, cleaning up time, and appearance. But, after using each one on an almost daily useage, the non-stick surface peeled off in several places. Granted, each time I thought that I was to blame. I sprayed water on the hot/warm grill and cleaned with a cloth or damp paper towels. Each of the 3 grills peeled. I am convinced that this is still a good product and I will probably buy another one. But will contact the company first to see why each surface has peeled off."
4,Great for starters.,"The cluster bomb is a perfect rocket for beginners. With time and patience, this kit can be completed in a couple of days. My 8 year old had no problems other than wanting to launch away before the paint dried. Also, put the streamers on the cluster bombs. They are easier to find in the grass that way. Lastly, be generous with the wadding. If you don't, you'll be replacing the melted parachutes after every launch."
5,fun,great toy for my child for learning flight. very fun to chase the bombs as they fall. He loves it. Thank you
4,Juice master,This is a great book. Very informative. Easy to follow. Great recipes.I would recommend this book to anyone with a juicer.
5,Great Replacement Ribbon,Great replacement ribbon for my Pyramid 4000 time clock. Works Great! Would recommend to anyone! Five more words to finish.
2,Pyramid Time recorder ribbon,"The first ribbon I ordered was defective , but they promptly sent another after calling them. Now I am waiting to see if I receive credit."
4,What an amazing season!!,"I wish I'd had a dvr in 2004 so I could've recorded the entire season. This DVD is a little ""cheesy"" but it includes highlights from every game including several from the incredible capital one bowl! GO HAWKS!"
4,Special Little Apple Doll,"This doll reminds me of Native Americans, with her red skin and wonderful painted face. She is delightful; her hair is very long, almost reached her ankles. I opened up the sides of her kimomo (all lined, well made) and folded back the sleeves so the hands show, and have her displayed with her little pony friend."
2,Hymns for the Organ,"This is a disappointing CD. I've loved the organ and hymns over the decades, but this is suitable for funerals; not for Easter.The dynamic range is rather simple, and the voicing (choice of pipes) is uninspiring. My spouse and I kept remarking that everything sounded like it was being played in a minor (~~sad) key.On a positive note, I can recommend ""Hymns on the Crystal Cathedral Organ"" played by Frederick Swann.It breaks my heart to have to give a bad review to published organ music."
4,Not a bad DVD,I'm about 4 weeks into owning my first electric guitar. I have 30 years experience watching my friends play but never had the discipline to actually start to learn. This video is helping me to structure my first weeks with the guitar. It has a good variety of topics and leads you to simple chord and riff playing relatively quickly. It also lightly touches on theory so that there is some structure to the progression of topics. Note the booklet is decent though it didn't have some of the strumming patterns cited in the video -- very minor irritation. Time will tell if this DVD will help me in the long run but I don't regret the money I've spent.
4,Great way to learn lead guitar,"I've been teaching myself to play guitar for about a year now and I've read many books on plays chords and lead. This video was great because it visually demonstrates techniques in ways that a book can never cover. After spend 2 months or so going through this DVD I'm now able to play some complex strumming patterns, a bunch of scales, perform bends, hammer-ons, pull offs. The books I've read did a good job of explaining the basics, but working with this DVD 3-4 times a week really helped convert the infromation from the books into actually playing skills."
5,Fantastic,I highly recommend this DVD. I've never played guitar before and I'm now learning to play as if my teacher was sitting right there with me.
2,good poker too much filler,"I liked the poker part of this dvd but there's just too much other junk! Its pulled straight from t.v (like a lot are)but you have three bad commentators ""welcoming you back""every ten minutes or so.At the start of every episode you have to watch the whole ""how hold'em is played"" and""what beats what"" segments.For television that's fine but should of been edited out of the dvd. You can't hear much table talk for the announcers.THE GOOD PART:This is back when Gus Hansen was new and people hadn't figured him out.He was fun to watch(he gets T.J steaming).The exrtas were also good(stories and tips).Just keep the remote in your hand and skip through the junk and you will see a poker game in there."
4,"""Better Than Average""",This DVD recaps the 1st Poker Super Stars series where Gus Hanson won it all. I would recommend this DVD.
3,Middle School Memories,"This was the video I was forced to watch in Middle School Health class. The video itself is hilarious in today's context, because it was made so long ago, and the style is completely outdated. Some of little Jimmy's experiences are quite abnormal, though. I don't think it's normal to ask a zoo keeper about your little member, and it's even less normal for the zoo keeper to respond about how much he says the little members of elephants... Be prepared to laugh, then be seriously disturbed for a while."
4,Wish I had found this sooner,This was introduced to me by my son's girlfriend from Brazil and I just love the fact that after using it my hair does not come back for a few weeks. I have never felt my legs so soft!! It works on the arm pits if you can endure the pain and sometimes grabs the skin if not pulled taught. I recommend this product highly.
2,"Effective, but low-quality construction","Effective at removing even heavier hair, but not the greatest construction. I suspected this item was made in China before ordering, and that turned out to be correct. My better judgement would have had me return it in the first 30 days for a full refund, but I didn't, and, unfortunately, a plastic bearing race broke after not that much use (it still epilates, amazingly). I'd recommend the Braun EverSoft over this, esp. as it's only $2 more currently here at Amazon, and Braun epilators are made in France and last much longer."
2,not that effective,not very satisfied by this product. it doesnt get the small hair and doesnt feel as smooth as waxing. hair grows back with in a week. makes lot of noise. I wouldnt recommend this product to any body.
3,Good but ouch!,"This product is good. The hair doesnt grow back for at least a week or so, but there is a problem of ingrown hair. Also, if you cant handle pain, this one is not for you. It DEFINITELY stings!!!"
3,Slow - Not the best design,"This hair remover works whenever it catches the hair. The problem is that the tweezers are aligned, so it only catches 1/2 the hair in one pass. It takes many passes to tweeze it all, so I rate it only 3 stars; my previous hair remover (a Braun) had non-aligned tweezers that removed all the hair in a single pass.This is probably why this Remington hair remover is inexpensive. It does the job, if you have a lot of time on your hands."
4,Very good product,"Yea, it hurts (mainly under my arms), but it works very very well. It doesn't really hurt on my legs at all, but it is pretty time consuming to get all the hair off the first few times. It probably works best on small areas, like the underarms, for this reason. Once your hair starts to grow back sparser and weaker, it works a lot faster. Be careful- the first time I used it under my arms, I burned myself because I held it too close to my skin for too long. Its easy to use and maintain, and the benefits definitely outweigh the setbacks."
5,It's great!,"This product is so worth the money I paid for it! I used it on my legs once a week for two weeks. After that I didn't need to use it again for a month!My roommate tried it and she found it very uncomfortable, but I feel very little or no pain at all when using it on my legs. The bikini area is a different story, though. I worked on that area every day for about a week just because my skin would get so red and puffy. I think it was worth it, though. No razor burn and the mild swelling went down after about an hour.If you're thinking about buying this priduct, DO! I love it!"
3,OK,Works OK- does tingle for those of you that are ultra sensitive. It does not pull every hair from the root some do break off and you have to wait for more hair growth. I do it about every 3-4 days to get the new growth. Also do at night it will leave noticable red bumps. I tried to get this from amozon but it was sold out- so I went to the local store and it was only 39.95 no s&h.
4,Does the job,"I thought I was ordering a razor, tried it when it came, hurt a little bit the first time I used it, but it really does work. It also gets more comfortable after using it once a week."
2,Hair grows back in a week,"This product is quite a disappointment because it does not do what I expected of it. I bought it because other reviewers raved about it. I use it mainly for my facial hair, since I don't have much on my arms and legs. I used to shave or wax. My facial hair would start growing back in a week with shaving or waxing. I was hoping that this product would do better, but it does not. My hair is soft and fine, so maybe that's why it does not work for me. When I use this product, I can see my hair breaks in the middle and does not get uprooted completely. The pain is nothing if you can withstand waxing. I am still using it only because it is more convenient and cheaper than running to a salon for waxing and psychologically suits me better than shaving."
4,it is little easire than waxing,"I really like this porduct. It doesnt take long time as it takes for waxing and also takes long time for the hair to come back. But onething I observed is , if you do not do it regularly , like you got very busy and did not do it,u can see that two hair strands coming from one root and makes it a real big volume than before. But if you do this regulary its a good product to use.....I love it!"
5,I LOVE IT!,The remington EP1000 is the best - better than my last hair removal system Braun - which yanked my skin. A very effective and easy way to remove unwanted hair - once you get used to hair being pulled out by its root - its gets less painful - even works on very short hair.
3,Quite painless,"This epilator is reasonable painless, easy to use, compact and pretty in its carrying case. However, it doesn't get all the hair, even after repeated, long-term use. It's perfect for parts of your body that don't need to be perfectly smooth but where you just want less hair."
1,Do not use it,I used it couple of times on my legs. Resulted in too many in-growns.I never had in grown hair on my legs before ..Until I Used this.My legs looked UGLY and I had to go back to traditional waxing and it took me almost a year to make my legs look better.
5,NO HAIR....SUPER SMOOTH LEGS!!!!,"I used a coil Epilady back in the 80ties and IT WAS PAINFUL!!!! This particuliar Epilator has a little sting but works great IF you follow the instructions!!!! My only vice is that if you grab a fold of skin....OUCH!!!! It has worked wonders on my legs but please take note: afterwards you will have red bumps just like the process after plucking your eyebrows. The bumps will fade in less then 24 hours and you will be left with baby soft smooth legs. I have yet to try this product on my armpits and bikini area. I would definantly recommend the Remington EP1000 Smooth & Silky Epilator to every woman. It comes with an adaptor, nice little storage pouch, and cleaning brush."
1,S_U_C_K_S!!!,Just recieved this product and could not wait to try it. Unitill it touched my skin. The pain isn't to bad since your leg will go numb after a few minutes. But the BAD part is ...when you look at your legs it only cut not even 1/2 of your hairs!!!!!!!!!! So you endure PAIN and your legs aren't even smooth. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !! Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY. I'm sending mine back !!!!!!!!
2,Ouch.,"As one who could definitely use to shave every day, but naturally wishes for an easier solution, I was excited finally to purchase an epilator. When it arrived, I immediately plugged it in and went away at my lower calves. The excitement died down quickly as the pain of needles digging through my flesh overcame me. I managed a tiny area on my calf, a bit on my knee, and a spot on my bikini line. Interestingly enough, the bikini line hurt the least. Anyway, my trusty razor was back out the next morning, and this little gizmo is back in the box. I didn't think I had a low tolerance for pain, but perhaps you will have better luck with it!"
3,Love this product!! Smooth legs & underarms - no shaving!,"I have thick, dark hair on arms & legs, and bought this product hoping it would slow down the growth (rather than just shaving it off DAILY). Using it for the first time stung a bit, but I put up with the discomfort. Am glad I did! (It didn't hurt so bad with subsequent uses). My favorite spot to epilate: armpits!! No more razor stubble -- smooth armpits (with no gray ""shadow"" from the stubble). LOVE IT!!!"
5,Smooth!,"The Smooth and silky hair removal system does just as it says. It's not painless, but no where NEAR the pain of waxing, and is much better than shaving! I've used it on my bikini line, and it worked extremely well. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick easy, long lasting, hair removal product."
2,Not as great as I hoped it would be...,"After reading all the wonderful comments about the Remington EP1000, I thought I'd give it a try. I followed the advice from past users and found that it did take most of my hair out! I loved that part of it. However, after a few days, when my hair started to grow back, I found a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs. I tried using it again, but found more ingrown hairs than before. Now, the Remington EP1000 is sitting in my closet and I have gone back to shaving..."
5,smoothness with little or no pain,"I have been using this product for a year. I thought I had lost it, so ordered a new one --& promptly found my old epilator. However, it's such a great device that I am happy to have a back-up. It hurt a little the 1st few times I used it, but unlike waxing it didn't burn & I could stop & let myself relax before continuing on. By about the 3rd or 4th time of using it, the only parts that were still sensitive on my legs were the ankles & knees. I tried waxing & found it to be too painful, while shaving just resulted in dry, itchy skin. This epliator has been fantastic & I've recommended it to many friends, who have also been surprised by the lack of pain."
1,worked great for a few months,I had bought this Item and was verry happy at first. Yes there was some pain but to be expected.. Come on it pulls the hairs out by the root. How ever the thing that maid me upset is it lasted about 6 months total and the gears went out in it. I sent it back and they sent me a new one I only had to pay the shipping but the next one lasted about the same lenght of time.
1,Not happy,I am very familiar and have used hair removal systems for many years. I was not happy with this system. It was by far the worst unit I have ever used. It grabed and pinched my skin leaving large welts. It happened when I least expected it. It would go along smooth and then grab and pinch without warning. I would never buy again.
2,Ouch,"This is not the best but it does take some hair off, however i couldn't get over the pain long enough to actually find use out of it. I have mildly sensitive skin and it left little red blotches and bubbles on my skin. Don't buy if your skin is the least bit sensitive or if you have a low tolerance for pain."
1,Bad Epilator,Please dont go for this...it hurts like HELL...and my skin was burning/itching for a long time where it plucked my hair...Epilators are supposed to be smooth...feel waxing is much better as it removes all the hair at once atleast...!! This one is too Terrible...!!I returned this product...waiting for the money back..!!I suggest people with sensitive skins not to go for this....!!
2,Blackmail Boys,"If you buy this film (DVD) based on the Shumanski name, and were looking forward to a film, as creative and cutting edge as their other film `Wrecked' save your money. This title should be rented only, if you buy it, my guess is you will only watch it once. If you are a hard core Shumanski fan, you might watch it twice."
2,"Good Nudity, But Little Else Worth Mentioning","Blackmail Boys is a gay-themed drama in which we get to see every inch of the three main actors, including erections. But, unfortunately, that is the only thing that could possibly make this movie of any interest. The script, acting, and direction are pretty dull. The pace is very slow, yet the film is only 67 minutes. That is not good. I'd say that this is worth seeing only for those that want to see some male nudity from ""average"" guys."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad.","Was not bad, was not great. I watched with an open mind and did not find the movie or the plot hard to figure out or follow, however if you are expecting a high budget movie with well crafted actors you will not like this one. If you saw and liked ""Wrecked"" you will probably like this movie, if you are looking to be entertained for an hour and 10 minutes this movie does the trick."
1,Terrible.,"The plot sounded interesting... The movie itself is just terrible. Lowest video quality, the story has entirely too many holes in it, doesn't make sense half the time. Takes more than half of the movie to actually get to the point... I stopped watching twenty minutes to the end - couldn't suffer through it any longer."
5,gosh its amazing,"this cd is full of great guitar rifs, amazing vocals (thank you anthony green and cove), and just overloaded with tons of energy. Bury your head starts off the cd and i believe it is one of the best tracks there, its comes action packed and it makes the listener just beg for more! To conclude the cd Bury Your Head acoustic really does it. WOW! that is all that describes it. Saosin equals out to be just one amazing and great band. Thanks guys for being so great!-Aaron Brown"
4,4 of 5 for just 5 songs,"SayOcean is a soon to be premiere. They're demo acoustic is fantasic. After 15 years of pounding skin, I have to say: Alex - Drums are unbelievable. The current Avenge Sevenfold tour should help their fan base. I have yet to see them in concert."
2,OMFGZ,seriously man I didn't really dig this EP.translating the name was a masterpiece but this...well lets just say bury your head acoustic is the only reason it's good.The truth is the same songs on this album are on the LP. It has a different vocalist but in my opinion anthony green doesn't shine as well as he did in the first ep or circa survive.sleepers > I wanna hear another Fast song. Enough said.
5,Amazing...just amazing,"First of all, Bury Your Head Acoustic is hands down the best song ever recorded. If you're into heavy guitar thriffs and only listen to music because of it, the album is just soso. But if you're like me and appreciate good singing, this album is for you. If you won't buy it, at least download it."
5,I want to get Saosin Prego.,"Solid EP. Vocals are great on the first and last track and are good on tracks 2,3, and 4. The guitars kill. The drums are sweet. I will blow my load when they release a full album.ohhh, gaaawwdd."
4,To clear up the controversy over the name,"Here is a quote from former singer Anthony:""It's pronounced SAY-OCEAN. And it's a Chinese proverb from the 15th and 16th centuries. It means ""small heart"". Fathers used to marry off their youngest son's for money and used to tell them that they weren't marrying for love, that their wife doesn't matter. She could die at anytime so don't get attached. They had to love with caution and raise their sons to be cold and unfeeling as well. I found it in the 8th grade and loved it, I used to name all my old bands that and write songs about it.""Link: http://www.saosin.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=801"
3,ok but not great,I love Saosin and also like the new singer. But I found these songs boring. Hopefully their full length c.d. will be better. Its also about time they came out with a full length disc since I'm getting sick of ep's.
5,"A nice preview for the ""Saosin"" album","(my first real music review so please be patient with me :) )Just got my new copy of the ""Saosin EP"" in the mail today.I gotta say, it's a good, stand alone EP album by one of my favorite bands.I picked up ""Saosin"" about 2 years ago (when I just heard about them) so didn't get into the whole ""Anthony"" vs ""Cove"" arguments like I see today. But anyway, just gotta say that even this EP would have been enough to get me hooked on Saosin.This being pretty much a demo Cd of the ""Saosin"" Album you would think it would just be a waste to spend a few bucks more to hear the old versions. don't let that stop you, It's easily one of the Best EP's I have heard in awhile (and it's nice to hear what some of the songs sounded like before making it to the official CD)So I would say, if your a Saosin fan, pick this one up5/5Andrew"
3,Guise for Saosin,I was somewhat dissapointed because I thought Anthony Green was the vocalist for the first Saosin demo.I loved the product but I missed Anthony!Catch him with Circa Survive!
4,Ehh,"This was my last purchase of the Saosin collection. I bought it just so I could say I owned it, I already own the other two. I'll write this as if I had not heard the new album, it would probably be much more enjoyable. Actually, this gets 4 stars just for the fact that the songs they did make on here they improved on [Bury your head I have nothing to say about, honestly I couldn't tell the difference]. But ""I want another fast song"" and ""New Angel"" were GREATLY improved. Lost symphonies, I didn't care for. I cringed when Cove tried to be Anthony, it just doesn't work for him. Cove is amazing, as Cove, not Anthony."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Bury Your Head is another predictable hit of chunky powerchord rock with limp octave chords and two-note dissonant chords used in the most conservative radio-friendly way possible from these masters of bringing top 40 rock to underground emo kids. Apparently they have a different singer now but you wouldn't know it from listening to him. He follows the generic commercial emo singing style to the letter, refusing to let any character or personality enter his vocal delivery at any point. New Angel takes the overproduction up a notch and in typical mainstream pop tradition places the focus firmly on vocals and drums, the guitar drops out almost entirely on the verse. The drumming is actually kinda creative, but hardly enough for it to be the focus of the entire song. You'd probably be better off picking up Hoobastank's latest album, it's basically the same thing as this ep except slightly better."
1,Saosin was a good band..,"Saosin was a great band until Anthony left, Cove joined and signed to Capitol. This EP lacks the energy the first EP had. The songs sound generic and aren't worth a second listen. GG Saosin for signing with a major label and turning into a steaming pile of feces. This EP doesn't even deserve one star. Don't waste your money."
4,Q&A PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition,"I think it is a very good book to have if you are knew to project management, especially if you plan on taking the CAPM exam. The downside of this book, in my opinion, is that it could have more questions and more specific, trick questions. I found that most question are fairly easy if you have read the PMBOK guide."
4,Pass that CAPM/PMI Exam:,"The questions and answers in this book are well written and clear. Questions are well aligned with PMBOK definitions and are a close parallel to the format of the Project Management Institute (PMI) exam, which is more than can be said of many of the online practice tests. I passed the CAPM exam after a few weeks study and these Q&A's were an invaluable aid in helping me learn and understand the different knowledge areas and project management concepts. My only comment would be that more 'scenario-based' questions might have been included, as there are quite a few in the PMI exam, but it is nevertheless a great resource."
5,you wont regret it,"Just buy it - you wont regret it. :)It's full of multiple choice questions. I use it as a summary, self assessment tool in conjunction with my PMBoK."
3,"It's useful, but it's not all you need","You can practice waiting for a train, bus, etc. It's not enough for anything, but it's a useful practice.I honestly think it's enough with Rita Mulcahy's software. You can get there these and many more questions."
3,Not for PMP,"Be warned that it doesn't contain the same type of situational questions that you will find in the PMP test. While these simple questions about concepts in the PMBOK might help you to practice for the CAPM test, the author doesn't even claim that the book will help you prepare for any test.I bought this little book because I wanted to practice a little more, and because it was on sale. I finished it in less than two hours and never touched it again. A 100% success rate with these easy questions doesn't mean that you are prepared to pass the PMP test."
4,Execellent Resource,"This is an excellent resource that will help you understand and review several concepts in the PMBOK Guide. The only problem is that the answers provide quotes from the PMBOK Guide and no explanations. The questions are simplistic: may be good for the CAPM exam, but not for the PMP exam.To prepare for the PMP Exam, I used the PMP Exam Quicklet by Paul Sanghera, which contains very realistic questions."
1,Non-Receipt of Product,I never received this product. I never got any notification on what happened with this product.
5,Cream - 'I Feel Free: Ultimate Cream' (Polydor),"A superb 23 track collection of Cream's repertoire. This HAS got to be one of the better compilations of their work available. Starts off with a cut that I barely remember,their very first UK single ""Wrapping Paper"" and carries on with most of those gems that you'll never get tired of hearing, like ""N. S. U."", ""I'm So Glad"",""Strange Brew"",""Sunshine For Your Love"",""Politician"" (one of my personal favorites),""Crossroads"" and ""Born Under A Bad Sign"". An absolute must-have."
1,lol this movie really sucks,I think first of all it was whack actors and actresses in this film. I personally think the whole movie was crazy. It did not satisfy me at all. I think it could have been alot of better actors and actresses. Please leave the acting to someone else.
4,60's style fun,I'm not a fan of revues or juke box musicals. I didn't see this show when it played off-Bway. I listened to the CD online and then ordered it. I'm glad I did because it's a trip. Having all these 60's songs on one CD is a hoot. Another plus is the orchestrations and voices of the ladies singing....both A+.Also - the CD plays for the longest time frickin time making it perfect for blaring while cleaning the house.
1,An awful mess 60s Pop with 50's do wop beat,"What a great collections of songs, the originals with a pulsating hip 60's beat. But these interpretations are as bad as can be, the arranger mixed genres with no sense of camp or ear and presented them to a 50's do wop beat that sucks the life out of these other wise fun songs. It's a real miss. Yes, there are a few comic gems like the James Bond Theme, but just download that and skip this disc. The original songs are much better and these girls don't add to them, they just wreck them. Too bad, it seemed like a great concept. Just the wrong wrong wrong people incharge of putting the music together."
2,"60's collection, not a musical","I understand that the most recent thing is to take groups of one band or artist's songs and make a musical (Movin' Out; Taboo; Mamma Mia) but this takes a small group of songs from the 60's and makes a musical. Maybe if you saw the show it would make more sense, but the CD gives nothing as to the plot, or characters. This is not a Broadway CD, it's a 60's Ballad CD. Don't get me wrong, the voices and music are great, but to be advertised as anything resembling a musical is just plain wrong. Musical Theater collectors can pass on this one (that is the first time I've ever said that) it shouldn't be part of a musical collection. But if you like the golden oldies by all means get this one. I didn't give this CD two stars because it's bad, it is just advertised wrong and shouldn't be here. Favorite song: ""Goin Back"""
2,a little disappointed,"I was so excited to receive Klimt and His Cat, but was suddenly disappointed when flipping through the pages and saw bare-breasted women. One was in an illustration showing Klimt's models and the other three are included in original paintings in the back of the book. I was planning on using this in my elementary art room, but those details are going to ruin the fun, knowing they will be pointed out immediately. I am not returning the book because of the great story and the other fun illustrations, I am just going to have to get creative on covering up Klimt's models with attaching paper clothes. I just wish this would have been brought to my attention before my purchase, so I am trying to help others out."
5,Brilliant and provoking,"Black's clear advantage was that the timeline span of the subject was avoided by most historians, probably because it's difficult to compile into a single piece of work. But, Black have done it in a fashion, arguably, very original than most historical atlases.The special maps and themes are divided into daunting blocks of adventure and you'll not stop until the last pages. There are new insights into the clashes between Portugal and Utsmani Devlet in and around the Indian Ocean.Let's hope more works come out from this author, at least from the Cambridge Series. In the end, you'll wish the pages were much longer as your thirst grew unbearable."
2,"Lavishly illustrated, lots of maps, well-written text, but somehow arid","I really can't get into this series, but I should be able to. In theory, this should be my ideal history of warfare book, richly illustrated and with many maps (often lacking from military histories). But the text leaves me cold and feeling I'm missing something.."
3,Not for the Wargamer or Military Historian,"This Atlas is too general for the Military Historian and wargamer, but is a nice worldwide historical overview. It does have some good political maps, but there are not a lot of them, and they are only snapshots far apart in time. When I think of an Atlas I think of page followed by page of maps. This book is mostly text with many illustrative maps, and lots of non-map pictures. It is not as detailed as some other historical Atlases. I do not mean to disparage this work, it is a very good, very colorful overview, and puts military history in context. It is not however, a book that will provide informative maps for the Military Historian, or gaming enthusiast. Definately a book to check out of the library, It would be a good buy as a color paperback, unfortunately I paid for a hard copy."
3,"It's not bad...not great, but not bad","This isn't a bad book especially if you are looking for a good, general history of warfare during this time period.At times the author gets a little heavy handed with the political correctness. For example, he states in the preface how he wanted to move away from the ""customary dominance by western European developments"". Then on the very next page he says ""it is all too easy to take a Eurocentric perspective...""Whatever. Can't historians just write their books nowadays without having to drag all this PC baggage around with them?If you can slog through the rhetoric this book isn't so bad."
4,Great short encycleopedia of poisons and antidotes,"Written in laymen terms this is a useful book for defining terms. You won't find any biochemistry here, which is great if you want a short answer but bad if you would like to know the chemistry --- how does a particular poison attack?Herbes are identified by name but not by any manner by which they could be identified in nature.Antidotes, what few exist, are identified but again, in words only. The biochemistry is again missing.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
4,Best Edition Yet! Later released as...,'Fourth Reich of the Rich'. The spiritual dimensionIS the missing dimension in the World Government/'New' World Odor. Either this edition of the FourthReich of the Rich are the best books written in the1970's-1990's Era of Christian-Patriot-Revisioniststudies. Highly Recommended!
3,Could Have Been Better,"I kept wanting this book to improve upon itself. It has an interesting premise and a very catchy ending, but there are too many problems in the writing for me to give it a strong recommendation. The author is trying to make parallels between the life of her protagonist, Isabel Latimer, and Isabel's writing (she specializes in high-toned fiction about moral choices). Now, of course, Isabel has a moral choice to make. What will she do?Unfortunately, she drags out the story and the point of view from which the story is told isn't consistant. The writing ranges from very good to downright trashy. When the story goes into somewhat deviant sex scenes it just gets silly. There are also holes in the story that a truck could be driven through (a man puts on woman's clothes and makeup in ten minutes, and fools an entire television studio. Yeah, right).It was interesting enough to keep me reading, but was a lost opportunity for what could have been a boffo story."
3,Not what you would expect from Philippa Gregory,"I knew before starting this wasn't your typical Philippa Gregory that we have come to love. But, I needed a Z title for my alphabet challenge and lets face it, there's not a lot to choose from. This book was a little bizarre and little racy. You have the author/housewife and her alter ego having an affair with her agent while they are both dressed in the alter ego's clothes. Add that to the disabled husband who suddenly improves while hanging out with the pool man. Plus, you have the constant discussions of money. It seems like everybody needs some (and by some I really mean large quantaties). What you get in the end is a twist of events that leave you slightly disturbed and thinking WTF? I couldn't stop reading it though. You can see the end coming but you can't stop yourself from watching everybody fall in the process."
3,"Zelda slices, dices, juliennes","A silly story. But sometimes silly is fun. A charming, but predictable farce juxtaposing ""serious"" literature and ""trash"" that sells--all by the same author."
2,where is the last chapters?????,"I have read about 10 of Ms. Gregory's novels since falling in love with the idea of the ""Boleyn movie"" (I didnt watch it thankfully but read it in a 2 day period) HOWEVER... a different genra for the author shows a bit of difficulty in ending the story without relying on history... dont sit up waiting for a great ending.. this one drops you cold. Sorry Philippa... I still love your other books!"
1,Zelda's Cut,"The orginal shipment came on time - The product (book) was in terrible condition and should never have been sent. Upon receiving my complaint a second book was shipped, in much better condition. Thank you"
1,Buy something else,The attachments broke after a weeks use. The plastic that attaches is so poorly constructed that you have to be extremely careful with them to get a couple weeks of use - even then they will break with extremely careful use. I'm looking for something else to replace it. I'm sorry I bought it.
1,"Actually, 0 stars","This is awful. It snags & pulls the hairs - very painful. Bought a Norelco, much better. After only two uses, this thing is back in it's box. The only reason I'm not returning it is just in case I need an emergency back-up trimmer.Not recommended!"
4,"Two or three years, still in great shape","Sorry to hear some other reviewers have had bad experiences with this product, but I love mine. Yeah, it's cheap plastic, but what isn't these days? No, it's not much use as a general purpose razor, but I never expected it to be; it's just a pinch-hitter in that area. It is, however, the best thing I've ever found for trimming mustache, beard, and nose/ear hair. Essential. Never have had any problem at all keeping a charge, either. Bargain. Glad to know it's still on the market, just in case this old faithful ever dies on me, so I can replace it easily."
4,Not bad...,"I thought that the clippers were very handy, they cut close. I've had them for a year now and they haven't needed sharpening yet. The attachments that come with the set aren't very effective though. The clippers stay charged for quite a while, I usually only charge them for an hour and then they are good for intermittent use for about a week at least. The charger for the clipper is supposed to hold all the attachments, but its arrange in a way that makes putting all of the attachments in it difficult. But overall I am pleased with this product."
2,"Attachments broke on mine too, in couple of weeks","I actually went online to look for an attachment replacement and found this site where it seems to happen to everybody else. It would be a 5 star, if the attachments didn't break so easily."
3,"Good, but not great.","The trimmer is a good value for the money in and of itself. I've had mine for about six months and it has worked great. It's the attachments that are it's downfall. After using it about once a week for six months the clips that hold the adjustable guards to the trimmer have all broken off. The guards are made of ..., thin plastic and can not hold up."
2,It's a Remington after all,"Though cheaply constructed, it worked OK for almost a year and did a reasonably satisfactory job as a beard trimmer. Then it became erratic, running at slow speed despite recharging, slow enough to ""bite."" I am replacing it with a Norelco 7500."
1,Not worth the trouble,"This trimmer is cheap and would be a good deal except the two plastic screens that are used to set the hair length both broke immediately. As it seems impossible to get spare parts this makes the machine useless. It also has bad vibrations and does a ragged job of cutting. It holds a charge well, but can only charge when placed in its stand. If you are in the middle of trimming and run out of charge you then have to put the machine in its cradle and walk away until it recharges as there is no provision to use it while plugged in. This machine is not worth the trouble. I would not buy it again."
2,Not completely impressed with customer care,"Remington has always been a good household name and while this was my first attempt at a personal groomer - I can't say I would recommend this one.The adjustable combs are cheap and were broken within a couple uses - just by putting them on they were weakend. The shaver tends to pull longer hairs before it cuts. And trying to purchase replacement parts (like the cheap combs) is almost impossible. I've searched the web and stores and can't find anyone who sells just accessories for this groomer.Even after e-mailing Remington to ask where I can get replacements, they never responded. Lack of customer service and cheaply made and hard to find accessories would definitely not warrant purchasing this item!! Don't waste your time or money - go with a Norelco!"
3,Looks good but...,"The lecturn looks good, and is quite sturdy which makes it easy to roll around. The sound is clear and it's great that you have the possibility to ad a wireless mic as well. On the downside, it is prone to feedback if someone touches the volume knob just a little bit after it is set up, and even with the ""anti-shake"" mic grip, if the speaker hits the stand while talking, you can hear a huge ""thump"". Great product but would improve a few things"
5,great blender,This blender is great. It blends ice perfectly. There are no giant chunks left in drinks. It is quick too. Some blenders seem to take the longest time to just mix a smoothie or something but I have whipped up iced coffee drinks in 30 seconds or less. I would recommend this blender for any basic household use.
4,It's Red,"One of my criteria in my blender search was that it had to be red. When I found this one and read the (mostly) good reviews I decided to take the plunge and buy it.It's a very pretty blender and the container is glass, which I really like. It's sturdy and well-made.Unlike some of the reviews, however, I am unable to get ALL the ice to totally crush, no matter what setting I use. It's not enough to make the beverages undrinkable, but that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.It's definitely a good value for the money!"
3,Sigh,"I was hoping, based on others' reviews, to receive a better-than-average blender. This is not. Smoothies/slushies get ice chucks. The blender does not really lend itself to these type of drinks. Popping the top to use a spatula to assist is just like any other blender. I really hoped for more/better."
5,Red and ready.,"Lots of power, great features, quiet operation and the best part is that it is red.The bowl is glass and very stout."
4,Less is more,"Hamilton Beach 52283WV 12-Speed Wave-Action Blender, RedOn the theory that less is more, my new HB blender is just perfect for my use as a morning protein drink mixer. It's quick and efficient, not terribly noisy and best of all requires very little dimantling and cleaning of metal blades and parts. The color is cheerful and overall is very easy to live with in my kitchen....certainly a very affordable addition to my life. LH"
1,Stopped working,We purchased this item in late summer and now in early December it absolutely refuses to work. I'm not sure why- we probably only used it about 10 times. It doesn't seem to come with a warranty. Obviously I would advise against purchasing it.
2,Not good to make indian chetney and other stuff,"I bought this item in amazon and after using 10 days I see some smoke coming from the blender coils. I think it is not good to use to make things like chetney and othere powders for food. I'm not satisfied with this item and i suggest to buy in walmart or some other store to do easy return, if it breaks.."
1,Worthless,"Had this blender for about six months and used it four or five times, nothing heavy duty, just purée veggies. Few nights ago while using it to purée cups of cooked chickpeas, some smoke came out of the motor base then it just die. What a piece of junk!"
1,Doesn't print. Complete failure,This arrived as refurbished and everything looked great and the clock works fine but nothing prints. A Terrible waste of Money.
1,Shipping rip off,looking for a time stamp document and came across this device....did not buy and willl not from this company$78 for shipping??
3,A reasonable 2nd from an ok 1st,"Carrying on the life of Kelly Maguire from ""The Lion at Sea"". This is the typical story of how a seaman manages to use common sense and earn the respect of his nemesis whilst climbing through the ranks.A servicable way to spend a few hours."
3,Never Gonna Lose,"Great song ""Never Gonna Lose My Faith"". Awesome song really. Really top rate. Hopefully kids listen and learn from the lyrics.Other than that song, it's a real dissapointment."
4,FINALLY-A FILM OF SUBSTANCE!,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TO COME ALONG IN SOME TIME! ESPECIALLY THE FANTASTIC THEME SONG SUNG BY ARETHA FRANKLIN AND MARY J BLIGE! LOOK FOR BIG THINGS TO COME FROM THIS RELEASE! VERY POSSIBLE OSCAR FOR MS FRANKLINS PERFORMANCE!
1,Where's the score soundtrack,"I can never understand why record companies consider already released music as a soundtrack. The movie contain great music composed by Marc Isham, with trumpet solos by the accomplished Tim Morrison. Tim Morrison was the solo trumpet in JFK, Born on the Fourth of July, Saving Private Ryan, and Apollo 13, to name a few.It is a real shame that they did not include more of the score in this soundtrack."
5,Great soundtrack. Brought back lots of memories.,"This is a very good musical snapshot of what was going on in the summer of 1968, so I can pretty much unconditionally recommend this soundtrack to both all who were there, and all who appreciate the great, great music of the psychedelic age. I'll concur with the other reviewer: it would have been nice to have Don Henley's version of the song as well as Aretha's version. Also would have been nice to have included Cream's ""Spoonful,"" which featured in a segment of the movie that was hysterically funny. While the subject matter is certainly not to be laughed at--and neither is the illicit usage of drugs--I have to tell those of you who haven't seen the movie yet this: The scenes with the two kids who are dropping acid for the first time are a scream, and add what I felt was some very welcome comic relief to a movie that tells us unflinchingly what is yet to come. The soundtrack is excellent, and the movie is superb...don't miss out on either one."
2,LIstening without movie just not the same,Good cuts. But without the movie to place the music into action they are just songs. Good songs. But played with the images and dialogue and they were worth buying. Played without. . . .better to go to Ebay and get the only the ones you want.
4,a new album new changes and it certainly rocks,"after releasing several good albums, most noticeable ""Who Cares"" and ""An Act of Goddo"", even a solid live album ""Best Seat in the House"" the Candadian powertrio tried their luck again with a more polished album. It even has 2 fine bonustracks on this CD-release. From begin to end it contains strong songs, the single and titletrack (without the s, that is) was a minor hit and both the classic ""Vampire Eyes"" and ""Forget About Forgetting"" (with very funny lyrics) were already on the forementioned live-album. Furthermore there are several nice songs, like ""Feeling Strange Today"". Being a threepiece the band doesn't show limitations in using instruments. So this a new effort and it works. Great piece!"
4,Earrings Review,They were smaller than they appeared in the picture. I'll probably not give them away.
1,"LOVE BOTH OF THEM, BUT NOT THE LEGS !!!!!!",I BOUGHT OUR FAMILY ONE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT I GOT ONE FOR THE DAUGHTER. AFTER A FEW MONTHS THE LEGS BROKE ON THEIR'S. NOW I HAVE LOOKED AT OURS AND OUR LEGS ARE BREAKING ALSO. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONTACT THE COMPANY AND GET NO PLACE ON THE WEB. IT'S A SHAME FOR ME TO WRITE THIS AS I HOPE IT DOESN'T GET OUT FOR PEOPLE TO SEE AND IS CAUCHT BY SOMEONE WHO WOULD CONTACT ME. I HAVE RECOMENDED AND SOLD SEVERAL OF THESE TO OTHER FRIENDS. I SURE HOPE THEY HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH THEIRS. SORRY FOR THIS !!!!JERRY MOLNAR
2,Not really grilling,"The grill is nicely designed and portable. But here's the problem: The whole cooking surface is solid, there is no open grill grating so you can barbeque your foods. Even the non-griddle side is a solid grating so there is no true sizzle. If you like to fry a nice steak go ahead, but I'd much rather have a true grill where there are ceramic briquets or flavorizer bars or something because this thing doesn't really barbeque meats."
1,not worth it,"sure it's portable if you want to keep taking off the shelves and the regulator...it doesn't clean up very well as you must clean it right away (no more lighting and scraping to burn off the gunk from the last bbq) foods with sauces burn right away and creat a mess...this item is really just a big ""foreman grill"" we took ours back after 2 weeks of trying it as we found this was just too troublesome for the money and the results ..10 minutes to cook a burger, but 20 to clean up after....this was not the product for us"
1,Think Twice!,"I received my Grill 2 Go as a gift. Now I know why. I've tried it several times and it just won't get HOT! Replacing the regulator made no difference. It's only usefull for warming up breakfast. I wouldn't call this a grill, it's a heavy griddle. I'm junking it and getting a Weber Q. I'd think twice before spending money on this."
1,no power + no heat + no space = no food,"While the design and portability are appealing, this is not the grill for those without plenty of extra time to wait as the grill warms. It took nearly 45 minutes to cook four chicken breasts. Additionally, the split between the grill space and flat cooking space really limits what and how much you can actually fit on the grill. I don't advise trying to cook for more than three or four poeple with this grill. Overall, unless you tailgate every weekend I would advise getting a normal gas grill.I've already returned mine and bet you will too."
1,Bad Regulator,I purchased this grill with high hopes. I did the startupsteps and then put it away for the winter as it was november.(stored in the optional storage bag) when I got it out this year the regulator would not shut off.
3,RV Camping,"I purchased my ThermosGrill in May 0f 2002. I took it along camping in our RV all through New England. It is light weight,easy to fit together and due to the air tight construction,I never loose the flame,even during high winds. It is extremely easy to clean. Don't be afraid to use water,use a lot of water,everything steams itself clean and away all your cleaning problems go right down the drip alley to the very well made plastic resevoir container. Great idea. I noticed many many more as summer time ended. I expect to see even more this coming spring. If you shop it just right super stop & shop usually sells them at end of summer for [money]....."
1,Soon to be a garage sale item.,"Contrary to the advertising, the grill is not easy to clean.It is very bulky. The first time I used it a little of thebutter I used on the right hand or ungroved griddle got underneath and started a fire. Had too take entire grillapart and completely clean. The cooking temp on the tempgauge, even though I had the gas regulator on high, nevergot to the high end of cooking range and I thought thingscooked too slow. ..."
4,grill,nice size for what i needed. folds up for easy storage in the snowmobile trailer.easy cleaning. the small tank makes it easier to store.
1,Should be called GRIDDLE-2-GO,"I saw this grill at Home Depot when this it first came out and had to buy it that day. I loved the look and the portability. When I went to use it, I found it didn't get hot. I called the manufacturer and they immediately sent me a new regualtor. Tried that one and it didn't make a difference. I sent the regulator back to the manufucaturer and asked them to test it, which they did and said it was fine. Within a week, I returned my grill to Home Depot.BOTTOM LINE - This is better designed for making pancakes and omelettes than it is for grilling steaks and burgers. The ""George Forman"" design doesn't cut it for someone who wants a ""real"" BBQ grill. It is bad enough that I have to sacrifice charcoal to get the ease of portability and cleanliness.I just bought a Weber Q grill. I haven't used it yet, but the BTU output and the open flame seems like it cures the problem. Check out reviews of that grill before you make a decision."
2,Disappointing,"The automatic ignition button broke almost immediately.The burner quit burning except for low. Takes forever to cook anything.The grill surface is solid, so it isn't any better than a stovetop grill.I am going to replace this and would not recommend it."
4,"Durable, but it's a griddle, not an open flame grill","I bought this for my husband 3 1/2 years ago and we use it as our primary ""grill."" We live in a city and don't have a lot of outdoor space, so this works well for us. I agree with the other reviews that it is in fact a griddle and not a open flame grill. Don't be fooled in thinking you will get the same taste and quality in cooking. However, we've been very happy with it to griddle all kinds of meats, kebabs and veggie burgers as well (having the separate flat griddle is nice for the vegetarians.)We are at the point now where we need to replace the griddle part because the teflon is flaking off after 3 1/2 years and a lot of use in year-round California BBQ season. The cheapest we've seen it online is $68 including shipping."
2,Not durable,"Teflon {?} finish wore off after about 10 uses, used recommended cleaner and lost almost all finish anyway. Cooks well, but very unsatisfied with cleaning."
3,A little flimsy.,"Considering the construction of this grill, it should be a little less expensive. The red body of the grill is very thin sheet metal with some flimsy efforts to add support to hinge points, etc. A fantastic concept, and a generally nice product, but I wish they had put more effort into making it sturdy... Go see for yourself before you plunk down the cash."
4,Neat Little Grill,"This is a very nice little grill, it has a non stick solid cooking surface, so you won't get that barbacue flavor. But for a quick cooking setup this is the baby. I'm cooking smoked sausage as I type I can smell it coming in the screen door.I think it cleans up a lot easier that a regular grill and it was made to travel. Just fold it up and your ready to go. A 20# gas tank is a must tho, those little 1# bottles just won't do it.one thing tho is the rubber cushions on the lid they are to protect the cooking surface, don't try to cook with the cover down unless you remove them, they will mealt with the cover down. Over all a great little grill tho."
3,It Works... Sort of!,"I've been using the Grill-2-Go for about 2 years now, and although I love its convenience and portability, it lacks in one area -- it can't ""burn"" a hot dog! It's nice to have a unit that is so simple to use, but you can't ever get a good ""barbecued"" flavor from what you're cooking. Good product -- not great."
4,Safe and easy,"I am an amazing klutz and went looking for a grill that was both safe and easy to use. This grill fits both categories. I always had a tendency to drop food down through the grate of other grills and this doesn't allow that. Also, since there is to access to the actual flames during grilling, you don't have to worry about flame ups."
3,Caravaning Dream,"The only thing that is disappointing with this Grill is that you have to use those mall tiny canisters of gas, I have a touring caravan and recently bought one of these for it's portability, but had to return it to the store disappointed. I thought that it would connect to our barbecue point on the caravan, but it's not advisable to use anything other than those canisters. Before I purchase another grill for my caravan would you please tell me if there would be any changes made to the grill-to-go or if I could make any changes to use it from a barbecue point. I feel that this would be an excellent advantage to the caravan for it has a large grill surface and portable. Please Email me back soon with any advises as I wish to purchase one soon. If it came with an option of a fix pipe for gas bottles then I would give it 5 Stars."
4,thermos grill 2-go gas grill,"First of all, the grill comes with a detachable/folding stand for easy outdoor table top grilling or for use with the stand which has shelves that the enclosed barbecue tools hang within hands reach for all your grilling needs. Also, it uses the 1lb or 20lb propane tank.The food which I cooked have included; steaks, hamburgers, hotdogs, ribs, corn, potatoes, have all come out exceptional. The grease runs off the grill into an attached plastic bottle for healthier cooking.Stores easily in a trunk. Cleanup is quick.The one and only disadvantage I could come up with was the weight of the product, which is not overly heavy but runs alittle weighty. But they do sell a canvas wheeled pullable carrying case(which I hope Amazon carries soon) that stores all the accessories and a 1lb propane tank."
2,"It's not a grill, It's a fry pan","Have hade this grill for 2 years now and hate it. Bought it to take camping to save space. I do like the way it folds away.It is hard to clean, and might as well use a fry pan to grill your t bones with the teflon grill. I think I'll bury it and try the Weber Q"
2,"Great looks, poor performance","My wife and I bought this grill as it looks really trendy and has sleek lines. It is an excellent travelling grill. Plus, its relatively easy to clean.However, the grill has 3 big cons:1. Low power: Less than 11,000 BTUs, so it takes a long time (over 25 minutes) to get heated to the optimum cooking temperature. Interestingly, the manufacturer does not list this important fact anywhere on the manual: I had to call the company to find out!2. No ""barbecue"" flavor: because its a solid grilling surface3. No ""barbecue"" aroma: it gives off almost no aroma/smokeBottom line: We're returning it today and getting ourselves a regular gas grill."
5,Amazing Lady!,"This Grill-to-go is one amazing lady! We take her to all of our camping and tailgating. I knew I had to have one after I witnessed friends with one not only cook hotdogs and burgers but also fixed a chicken stir fry with it. They also cooked bacon, eggs, and pancakes without the need for extra pans. We even heated our pop-tarts up on it! It is super easy to clean up and doesn't leave a greasy mess in the back of my van!"
4,Fits a niche,"I got this for my Mom and Dad but I use it often myself. I got this to add to/replace the exact model they already have. This one is taken with them in the camper as they travel south for the winters. I have a top of the line Jen Air and grill year around. I have used this one many times and am very pleased as there are NO flame ups. It takes a little longer to heat up but does a wonderful job grilling and the drippings funnel into a catch jug on the side which is very convenient. The burner got replace with the one that stayed at their home but only after about 2 years of use. I expect them to have just as good of luck with this one in the ""off"" season. Hope this helps."
2,No Open Flame Grillilng Here!,"This is a nice unit, but contrary to what some information posted says, there's NO OPEN FLAME GRILLING with this unit, so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. The cooking surface is SOLID, and the only difference in the ""grate"" area (a misnomer to me) and the ""griddle"" areas is that the ""griddle"" area is flat & smooth, and the ""grate"" area has raised ridges on it. If you don't mind your ""grilling"" being done without any open flame and just on a hot surface, then this could be a nice unit for you. If you're like me, and you want to cook over a FLAME, then don't buy this one!"
5,grill to go,Bought to carry camping. This grill has traveled and been used numorous times and cooks great. It is durable and easy to clean. Great item. I highly recommend it. I do suggest you get the carry case to keep grill from getting scratched up. Mine still looks great and the case has wheels to easily roll to setup.
4,LC,"I have had this model over two years and have used it at least a dozen times. The grill sets up in a flash, cooks great and cleans up easy. The ignition button has gone on into the great beyond but aside from that it's been a pleasure."
5,Good and Bad,"Actually, to say this item is ""good"" is an understatement. It is truly the ""BEST"" outdoor product I've bought so far. I've never enjoyed grilling as much as I have over the last year since I bought the product. All of my family and friends enjoy it. Sometimes borrowing and forgetting to return it.{""Yeah right.You forgot to return it.Buy your own.""} Weekend cook-outs have become a regular at my home. However,ehhmm! I've recently broken the stand by accident moving it around.(""BAD"")I can't seem to find it anywhere.""The grill to go site has disappeared."" How can i find this part without having to buy the whole product again? HELP!!"
1,Wish I could give it zero stars,"Save your money because you will have to haul this thing to the dump in two years. We bought one three years ago and loved it all summer. The next summer, though, the coating started to flake off of the cooking grate. We called the Customer Service line and they sent us another grate. So we had another great summer. But guess what? This summer, the same thing is happening, only now they're telling me (at CharBroil.com's customer service line) that they won't replace the grate because the grill is out of warranty. Never mind that the grate is only a year old, they were surly, rude, and generally abusive both times I called. They should be ashamed to be producing and selling such a cheap and horrible product. And now, the plastic that surrounds the ice chest is cracking so the yellow insulation shows through. And we can't see through the window to tell if it's lighted anymore.Horrible, horrible product. JUNK."
5,Tailgating at its best!!!!!!!!,"The Thermos Grill-2-Go is a must for a football fan that tailgates. Its ease of set up, quick clean up and great cooking make the tailgate party that much more enjoyable. It takes up less room and no more lugging a heavy grill, large tank or bags of charcoal. Just fun, fun, fun at the pre-game."
2,Great unit for the first six months,"I absolutely loved this unit when I first received it. I'd make pancakes on it in the summer so I didn't need to heat up the kitchen, and then cook dinner in the evening on it. Cleanup was always easy, and I could take it with me wherever I went. After a little while the terribly designed grease ""catcher"" began to cake up inside. Problem is that the opening is about 3/4"" wide and it is on one side. You can't really get anything in there to clean it out. Now three years later, the leg has cracked and the unit is tied up, ghetto, yes. The grease catcher, has caught plenty of grease, I took it off to dump it out the other day, and found maggots in there. This grill is going in the trash with the grease catcher."
1,not a grill,"This looks like a very nice portable cooking device that uses propane. Just be aware it is NOT a grill. It's a griddle. It's description says PART of its cooking surface is a griddle, but in fact all of it is, only some of the surface has raised edges to make grill-like marks on the food you fry on it. If you want the portability of stovetop frying (or steaming if you leave the lid down) on the road, by all means get it. If you want the flavor of grilling, don't."
2,Works ok,"It works fine if you limit what you cook on it. Can be difficult to clean and only works well on flat hard surfaces. Tends to tip over or rock. You can have mine, it's sitting out back not being used since I went back to using a charcol portable grill."
2,"Watch Out, Product was 2 years old","The first time I used the grill the regulator would not operate properly to allow constant propane flow. When I called the service center I was informed that the product was a 2003 model. They required proof of purchase in order to receive a replacement part.Grill works fine for burgers, but don't think I would attempt a steak."
1,Not the right cover-image!!,"I got the wrong item, because the image of the DVD-cover shown here is not the right one and the seller was confused too.It shows the DVD ""The Beatles - Around the world - Platinum collection (1995) (2005 DVD) ASIN: B000EONI88"", which is the awful one (Beatles only getting off planes ..)!!If you want to be sure of ordering the ""right One"", then order the ""The Beatles - Around the world"" DVD with the red cover."
5,Product works as it should,"As has been mentioned in a previous review, you need a Torx head tool to install. Specifically, a Torx T40. I would opt to use a socket as it will require a lot of torque to tighten screw and would be very difficult with a screwdriver. Time will tell how well these hold up but upon installation, they work exactly as they should."
5,It took me less than 15 minutes to change both sides,"I just completed the R&R; of both struts on my sister's 2002 PT Cruiser. After breaking the old bolts loose with a ratchet, I used a #40 Torx bit hooked up to my cordless drill to speed up the operation. Including the consumption of one 12 ounce beer, it took about 10 minutes start to finish. Your mileage may vary.The new struts fit perfectly. Just be careful not to cross thread when installing the new bolts. This is where your helper can assist by very slightly raising or lowering the tailgate so you can get the correct angle on your fastener.Note: A co-worker recently paid nearly $250 at the dealer's for the same repair on her 2005 PT Cruiser."
4,PT Efficiency,"Apart from the extremely efficient manner in which the product was supplied by Amazon, not to mention the surprise of finding this product at Amazon, and not mentioning the great price offered by Amazon as compared to local Chrysler supply costs, I was pleased to discover after some initial reservations, the ease in which they were able to be fitted to my car. I had both gas lifts fitted within 15 minutes and they are currently working beautifully. It is so nice after living with worn out gas lifts for some time, to have them now working so well, no more banging of heads on the half opened rear hatch. I'll be shopping for other things I thought unrelated, at Amazon.Ronaldo"
5,Easy to install,"This item arrived swiftly and was easy to install. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they were also MADE IN THE USA! Price was very reasonable, under $25 each. I installed a set on both of my PT Cruisers. It took about 15 minutes per car. I would highly recommend these door lifts."
3,Cool toy but very fragile,"These tops are really well-made, but the winding device is not so sturdy. Within hours of playing (yes, following the instructions), the winder lost 3 pieces making it unusable. I wrote the company and got a response promptly, including 2 replacement winding devices. So we are back in business, but who knows how long these winding mechanisms will last? My son saw this on one of the Baby Einstein videos. It is certainly not a toy for small children, and can be very frustrating for kids as old as 10."
3,Stacking Tops,"The tops are so much fun for everyone, but the adapter is not durable at all! The first one broke to where it was completely inoperable by the end of the first day!! We contacted the company and they shipped us one more. That one was finished in less than a week. Without the adapter, you'll just have 5 unusable tops sitting around. Do not waste your money on this product unless/until the company fixes this issue!! I bought the exact same product almost 8 years ago, and they still haven't fixed it! I doubt they ever will!"
3,Not As Easy As in the Baby Einstein Videos,"I was fascinated with the stackable nature of these spinning tops when I saw some on a Baby Einstein video my daughter was watching. She seemed to be interested as well, so I ordered them. They can be stacked. However, this requires practice, patience, and a steady hand, none of which is a good descriptor of my or my daughters predominant skill sets. I think I have gotten four of them stacked, but never all five. That required some effort as well. They must each be wound up prior to release, and this extra time reduces the amount of time you have available to stack the ones already spinning. I can only assume that either a) the Baby Einstein hand is incredible skilled and practiced in the fine art of top stacking, b) sinister special effects designed to frustrate purchasers of this product, or c) they had five different cranks pre-loaded and ready to release.Pros:-Fun-CheapCons:-Difficult to stack"
5,Fun to play with,My son loves this! It is great for motor skills and just to have fun with. My son is three and really enjoys trying to knock them all down after he gets them to spin.
2,Fun but Broke,My son love this spin alot but just a few spin and the it's broken. He still love it and try to spin by hand. Would not recommend this spin top for its poor quality.
3,Super Stacking Spin Tops,"This was a Christmas gift for my 9-year old son. The very necessary release broke within a few weeks. I bought a new one, as when it was working, he enjoyed the tops very much. We are a couple of weeks in, so far, so good but he now knows it has the potential to break so he's fairly careful with it."
4,Fun for kids of all ages,We had these when our grandkids were little and we ordered again for memories this year. They played with them all during Christmas. Ages 8 - 27 years of age.
3,Great top - when it's not broken,When functioning this toy is actually pretty amazing and the tops spin for a long time. The main issue is with the flimsy launching unit. The super cheap plastic launcher broken within a few weeks. The product is still usable but it's definitely not the same. If these guys can just use some quality products or improve on the design we have ourselves a winner.
1,Top releaser broken in a week,"It is fun toys. But top releaser broken after 15-20 useage. It made by very poor/thin plastic. I tried to glue the broken piece back, but it broken again in 2 useage. Can not be fixed. Very disappointed!"
4,"Nice top set, spinner is a bit flimsy","It's a decent, fun toy. The smaller tops will spin for a long time on a smooth surface. The spinner isn't strong enough to spin the larger ones very well."
1,Save your money!,This toy is smaller than you expect. It broke within the first day of use. I would not recommend buying.
3,It's fun until one key component breaks,"Some time ago while I was in a used toy store I noticed this toy and I decided to purchase it, a week later the pins inside the release handle which are made out of really bad plastic broke off.I thought well, it was a used toy and my 4 and a half year old can be a bit rough so I guess I'll buy a new one.Got a brand new one through amazon and it worked great for some period of time and then the same thing happened to me while I was winding them up for him. This happened less than a month after I bought it, the plastic pins inside broke off; it's a great toy but the mechanism inside release handle is awful all it needs is a little bit more reinforcement.I'd give it 5 stars if we could still use it."
1,burns and sticks every time,"i'm looking for a rice cooker on Amazon because I had this one for some time and it almost alwasy (99.999%0 sticks and burns. No way I am going to watch and stir. I bought a cheap one and I got my money's worth. I'm going to buy a Japanese machine, they outa know how to cook rice"
1,Uggh!,"Did Salton even test this thing before they started selling it?I followed the directions and it sprayed starchy water all over my kitchen.its in the trash now, still steaming....so am i."
1,Don't waste your money,"I got this one as a wedding present. Less than a year later, it overheated and melted its foot. I sent it back to Salton and eventually received a new one. Less than a year later, the new one overheated. Save your house from burning down and buy yourself a better one."
3,"It's Good but Has Bad Points, Too","My husband and I constantly argue over my rice cooker. He doesn't like it and wants to get a new one, and I like it. It's not as bulky as others, it cooks a great deal of rice, and it cleans up very quickly. It's also very easy to use -- my 9 year old has no problem: just add water, rice, plug it in.But then there's the other side. Although you are supposedly able to leave it alone, you do need to stir the rice every now and then to make sure it doesn't stick and burn. Also, the lid gets very very hot, and you have to worry about setting it down somewhere it won't break or be overly cooled and crack. It cooks faster than the guidelines say, also, so you have to watch the time. But other than that it's fine. I've never had a problem with overheating or parts melting or anything, and I have had mine for several years. It's a trusty hardworking little machine, but it's probably not for everyone."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not picky or a rice snob, and all I ask of a rice cooker is that it makes decent, edible rice. I bought this rice cooker after my cheapo White-Westinghouse one (which was really great!) finally stopped working, and was very disappointed. The lid sputtered and spat, which is something I'd be willing to overlook if the rice was okay, but it was substandard - it came out tough and slightly burned on the bottom and overcooked and mushy on the top."
5,Another fun book,"My toddler goes bananas over Go Dog Go, so when I saw this, I knew I had to get it. Even how cute and fun it is, you need to be preemptive and secure all flaps and such with clear book tape, even the whole entire dog party tree on the last page, tape it up it one big chunk and tape it down to the page- so it still pops up when open, but can't be torn off (I have seen this book destroyed in 2nd hand stores, and its not pretty!). It will last much much longer. You can't really do that with the spinning wheel, but that has held up surprisingly well for the last couple months of constant turning. A great companion book to the original Go Dog Go, I highly recommend it!"
4,Sophisticated first novel,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Having spent some time in the locations covered including Berlin, I felt even more pulled into the gripping story. It was thought provoking, sophisticaated and very well written. I look forward to reading more from Mr Gabbay."
4,Very good thriller,"I read this book in one day. Could not put it down. Very well written, amazing thriller."
1,Disappointed,"Whoever compared this to LeCarre, et al, must have been reading another book. Hated it."
4,Intriguing Conspiracy,"I picked up this book by chance with no preconceived notions about the book or the author Tom Gabbay. Turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Only 291 pages, the plot develops quickly and the action is brisk. Fairly straight-forward plot without extraneous characters or confusing tangents. Enjoyable enough to finish in a sitting or two.Turn back the calendar to 1963 where retired CIA agent Jack Teller is asked to come out of retirement to make contact with an East Germany agent. Curiously, the East German agent will only give his information to Jack Teller. The ""why"" is a mystery at first. But the information passed pertains to a vague plot to assassinate President Kennedy while on his scheduled trip to West Berlin. Is this plot real? Who is behind it? How will it work? And why was Jack Teller the sole conduit for this information? All of this is unveiled in this well-crafted and crisp espionage thriller. I look forward to reading more works by Tom Gabby."
2,physics of sailing,"The book doesn't go into alot of detail, but for the novice sailor it's more than sufficient for a good starting point."
5,Clear words,Clear and easy to understand words. I've found it very useful. The book covers the main physical phenomenas of sailing without complicated mathematical derivations and with interesting real life examples.I really enjoyed reading it.David Papp - Turbine Blade Designer
2,Not a very very deep dive,"The book is advertized as the book explaining the physics of sailing. The book has a promising start while deriving the hull speed formula over several pages. But that's unfortunately about it. The book is really shallow on actual science of sailing. The book is only a 150 pages on a large font, you'll read it in a day.The book makes also oversimplification of the phenomena involved. Eg it describes the sail with the grade school anecdote 'air travels a longer distance leeward to the sail, thus creating lower pressure'. While that might explain part of the physics involved, my sailmaker seems to have way better models...If just want a quick read on physics involved, this is your book. If you want to deepen your understanding, I'd go somewhere else. I learned a lot more from the old 'High performance sailing' by Frank Bethwaite."
3,Pretty good for the money,"This is better read at your desk with a pad and paper nearby. There are a few areas where you will need to run a few math problems to really 'get' this book. This is more of a college upper classman read than a warm winter night read.Once past the math and the tougher parts, you might start to look for more subjects like blocks and running rigging and the physics involved with them. Additionally, I'd like to see more about the why of some of the design trade offs in some of the faster racing boats (Americas Cup, Volvo Ocean, etc.). Also a good discussion of the tradeoffs in hull design for different purposes would be nice."
5,Very goog as a light introduction,"Excelent small book for an introduction.Easy to read, it gives a good overview of the main topics involved in the physics of sailing."
5,excellent source of information,An excellent book for anyone interested in understanding how hormones play such a pivotal role in so many physical and emotional aspects of our lives. It is easy to comprehend and doesn't require any special medical knowledge. It provides excellent references and resources for the reader who wants greater detail about any topic in the book.I highly recommend it!!
5,Written for the public but good for doctors too.,This book does a great job of explaining the growing problem of mae hormone deficiency and it's causes and treatments. Dr. Kryger gets to the root of the problem and sheds light on things that aren't covered in medical school. Every man should read it and learn about how to prevent and treat hormone problems
4,Joan of Arc paperback,This is probably intended for children but several adults have found it fascinating. The information learned was accurate and useful on a recent vacation in France.
3,Historical,"The Hundred Years War began in 1337 when a king wanted France to be part of England. It lasted until 1453. Born in 1412, Joan of Arc changed the course of history. She was a peasant who heard voices. She vowed never to marry. She was to rescue Orleans. And in combat they were successful. Joan's family rose to nobility. She was tried by the Inqusition to deal with heretics. If found guilty of witchcraft, Charles would be discredited. I read the book in one setting. She was burnt at the srake on May 31 1431. In 1920 Joan of Arc was made a saint by the Catholic church. A good look at a historical figure."
4,Good but not great,There were a few parts of the ebook that repeated and skipped. It just needs a little touch up. The actual content was great.
5,Awesome,Loved every minute of it... couldn't put the book down... read every spare moment I had :) :) :) :)
5,Wicked Spring is....well wickedly good!,"As a former reenactor and history buff the accuracy of this flick is top notch. The horror of battle is well portrayed as well as all the uniforms, accoutrements and weapons. The by-play of the characters is well done. I was actually angry with the main character for awhile and then realized I had been fully drawn into his dilema. Well done--huzzah! Al +"
3,Positive/Negative,"PositiveBattle scenes are excellent. A lot of work went into creating the battle scenes in this indie movie. Many types of emotions are depicted (bravery, confusion, empathy, sadness, cowardice, leadership, fear, pain). Battle sound effects were impressive.Period clothing and equipmentFocus on ordinary soldiers, not generalsConfusion of battleNegativeLow budget look and feel. Pharaoh's Army was completed on a budget of $500,000. Wicked Spring has a much more amateur-ish look.Improbable plot that the soldiers didn't know they were in different armies. In ""A Midnight Clear"", the Germans want to surrender and the Americans want to help them, but things go wrong. A different plot could have been the Union soldiers want the Rebels to help them get the wounded soldier back to a surgeon.Acting is weak."
4,Intense,"As an avid lover of Civil War films, i must say that ""Wicked Spring"" manages, in a few key scenes, to deliver one of the best depictions of Civil War close combat in any other film out there!Fantastic casting and performances. At moments, chilling."
2,Unbelievable,"I love this period of history, have read hundreds of books on the subject, etc. etc. Other complaints aside, this film is just poorly written. We are supposed to believe that there were no literate soldiers in the Southern army! C'mon, the poor guy had to carry those letters around for three years waiting for someone to read them because no one in the Confederate army could read? This is just silly, and the idea that these men couldn't tell they were with soldiers from the other side? I really wish I could give this film a good review, as there few and far between movies made on the war between the states, and good ones are really rare. Obviously this pleased many, and I'm prepared to take all the unhelpful votes from fans to warn others. Try Pharoah's Army, a truely outstanding indie pick of this time period, which while slow on action, tells a much more realistic story."
3,Pharaoh's Army,I had seen part of this movie on digital TV but had missed most of the beginning so I wanted to see it all. I found it a little slow in the beginning and there was not enough historical content for me. However both my wife and I enjoyed.
2,finale fizzle,wicked spring starts off with and interesting theme of soldiers from each side of the civil war experiencing the trials and heartaches of war and soldiering.there are good battle scenes initially but the movie then gets over dramatic and weepy over lost love and one soldier's manical hate of yankees as they sit around the campfire for the rest of the movie until their final wipeout in the middle of a battle.nice start with realistic fight scenes but the action is short lived and the drama takes over.a hard core cw buff would like as a collection additive but anyone else would be advised to pass. this flick could have been very good if the action had been sustained.
4,A personal experience...,"I thought this was an excellent war movie, lots and lots better than `Gods and Generals' with a more personal, human experience of the Civil War. Another excellent Civil War movie is `Ride with the Devil' and of course, 'Glory.' I found this film very powerful and thought it was well made, but I found it sometimes difficult to sit through - it's not a bad movie, just different in tone. I know it's not supposed to be a light film, but some of the scenes were traumatic to watch. I'm glad I saw it however. The war is shown in such a matter of fact way - people just get shot with no ceremony etc. exactly as it would have been. I liked the performances by Brian Merrick and Terry Jernigam. The rest of the cast was also great. I say get the video, it is a must see."
3,"Nice but,...","....the movie is far to short, they could have made more out of the story. what they did was nice so.."
1,"Bad, just bad","Wow, where to start. I like to consider myself a well read CW buff so I appreciate the fact they used plenty of reenactors to try and get the ""look"" right. Like most indie films I've seen, the whole thing seemed very amateurish, the acting as well the cinematography. Never mind plot holes. I would gladly tell anyone not to waste their money on this film, let alone their time. I truly feel someone owes me two hours of my life back or however long this trash dragged on for. Bad, just bad..."
1,Boring...,OMG... This was one of the most boring movies I have ever tried to watch. I'm donating this one to the library.
1,Don't Bother.,"This is most likely the worst movie I have ever seen. It's a pity, because I have a particularly strong interest in the battle of the Wilderness. I can't tell you how disappointed I was watching this film.Intensely boring with indiscernable dialogue, I bet even the cast falls asleep when they watch this film. Directed by Kevin R Hershberger and produced by mistake. Please dont waste your time."
4,very good Indie film...,"I would recommend this to all Civil war buffs and Indie filmmakers that have a chance to get a copy of this film. This is the first feature from this director and he does a great job. The story of two soldiers torn by war is as old as time, but ""Wicked Spring"" takes a fresh view at the troubles and trials of the Civil War soldier.The best scenes in this movie are between the Union and Confederate leads over the reading and writing of letters home. A touching and believeable scene. Outstanding music worthy of any big budget flick, an intense and deliberate use of great sound effects. The authentic feel of the movie is off the charts. If you get a chance, get your hands on this movie."
4,Classic 80s melodic hardcore,One of the best classic melodic hardcore from the 80s long before the lable 'emo' would have been placed on them. Sort of like Sticks and Stones or perhaps some of the west coast hardcore bands.Typical 'emo' (God I hate that word) style lyrics though.Give them a listen you wont regret it.
3,The bass player is awesome,"This album is ok, the bass player for this band though was and is the greatest ever, he is better than Beaver Felton."
3,NECROPOLIS is a weird name,"Personally I never saw this movie, and I do not intend to too, but the acting of Andrew Bausili probly was the only positive, considering he is an amazing actor I have witnessed this many times in English class where he is the teacher.Lots of Love, From a few students in Pd 9/10 English class"
4,Old Spanish not useful for Spanish Students,"This is a fairly good way to compare the English and Spanish versions of the Bible...If you are very fluent in Spanish. If you are learning Spanish, however, it would be more useful to get a version that uses modern Spanish. It has the advantage that it uses a modern English translation, but they do not use a modern Spanish translation like the Nueva Version Internacional, which also reads more like the New International Version. If you are quite fluent in Spanish, however and have no problems understanding the old Spanish, then perhaps this is the version for you."
5,Very nice inexpensive english/spanish bible,My wife bought one of these at a book store and now we have ordered more for some of her bi-lingual friends. Great choice of translations for accurate understanding and bible study.
2,"Lots of features, but not enough light","Make sure you are aware of the size of this mirror. It was taller and bigger than I wanted. The 'touch' lighting is neat, but none of the 3 settings were bright enough for me. The magnifying side was hard to use. I had to look in a certain spot to really be able to see. The extra plug on the base could come in handy."
1,Very disappointed,This was so disjointed...the story was hard to get into..the characters were not explored in any depth. Not a good example of Stella Cameron stories.
2,Decent light bulbs.,"They are pretty much unbeatable at this price, for tube fluorescents. They don't seem to do well in the cold - at all. Anything below 50* requires warm up time, and anything below freezing - they may not ever come on or stop flickering at all. I used them in a large garage and have several other (cheap - regular) bulbs, and none of them seem to have this issue. I know some bulbs are rated for colder weather, but I've never had any deal this horribly. They do well indoors though.To note: you'll probably receive this box without any packaging material around it, and the bulbs will be shattered. Take care when opening it. Might just want to try to find it locally and save the hassle.UPDATE : bumped it down to two more stars. Of the 3 bulbs that survived shipping, all of them had died with less then 5,000hrs on them. That's 1/4 the stated longevity."
1,Waves: Berkeley Physics Course,I could not believe my eyes that the book I received is a xerox copy. Does Amazon follows the copyright laws?
1,Sheeplike followers of the drug-company bought ADA,"There's an old vaudeville joke: ""Patient: Doctor, doctor! It hurts whenever I do THIS. Doctor: Well, don't DO THAT!""When we eat carbs, our blood sugar goes up. The solution, according to the ADA, is to eat lots of carbs, then take drugs to bring our BS down. No wonder; the ADA is financed mainly by drug companies. Pecuniam sequi!The simple, logical approach is NOT to eat things that raise our carbohydrates, as Dr. Bernstein has demonstrated. However, such simple logic doesn't boost drug companies' profits, nor can one claim it on one's insurance."
3,Kaiser Bakeware Kinder Kinder Kids 4-Inch...,"I purchased two of these for my granddaughters. I thought they would have been larger. I was disappointed that they were as small as they were. They are , however, well made and will do the job."
2,Disappointed,"When I ordered this text I was under the impression that I was purchasing a new text - not used. The book was obviously used, NOT new, because it had wear from having been read previously and has many sticky-notes throughout it to mark where the previous reader wanted to remember some part of the text."
3,A good bread machine but...,"I've been using this machine for about three years. The breads are really good, but I have some issues: if for any reason do you want to stop the machine, you have to re-start the whole process again; the kneading process is too strong and takes too long. I also don't like the big hole in the breads. I take care of my kitchen appliances very well, but the chrome is starting to show some brown spots. If you don't have another option, this is a good machine."
3,I trust there are better bread machines,"I bought this bread machine a number of years ago at a retail store. I haven't used it that much for these reasons:- It makes big rectangular loaves with a crown on the short end; makes very awkward and too-big slices.- It's fussy; if you have to stop it for any reason, you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the process. We had a short power failure after I had started the machine and I had to finish the bread the old-fashioned way.- It leaves a big hole in the bread from the kneading paddle.- It vibrates so much during the kneading that it once ""walked"" off the counter. After that I had to put it on a towel and put barricades around it so it wouldn't move.Having said that, the bread tastes fine if you can get through the entire process without incident."
4,Understanding the Scriptures.,Very informative and enlightening. Easy to read. Churches and study groups should use as a teaching tool for new members.
3,Not Read yet,I haven't started reading it yet so I can't fairly rate it. Perhaps I can change my rating later. Thank you
3,"Too many pages, not too much content...","If you are an absolute beginner 80% of this book is for you. If you bought it to explore the capabilities and more complex tools of Excel, you are at a loss. I've been using Excel for 10 years. Mostly for corporate needs in an office environment and as a calculation tool for some of my MBA classes. Bought this one to get more insight, but did not find it useful. Most of the pages are spent to describe the simplest of tasks, such as formatting, listing of built-in formulas etc...Won't recommend to intermediate and up users...Good day!"
1,Very Poor Reference for Excel,"This book is a compendium of information about Excel that is very poorly organized and presented. For example, most people want to use spreadsheets for doing some form of calculation, but formulas and how to enter and use them in Excel are presented in this book in Chapter 8 (hardcover, Gold Edition) entitled ""Creating and Using Formulas"" which starts on page 155! Then, a few pages into this Chapter he has a section entitled ""Referencing Cells Outside the Worksheet"" which is fairly advanced material - before he goes into how to copy a formula to multiple cells (a very basic thing to know). In short, stay away from this book unless you already know the material; it's not a learning tool."
3,Five stars? I don't think so.,"John Walkenbach offers some good ideas for using Excel, but I think that this book has too much fat and too little muscle. In my opinion, it isn't short, however, on advertising and self-aggrandizement."
4,Ladies Shaver Parts,These pieces for my shaver which were new blades worked pretty good. They were sent in a reasonable time. Thanks
5,Works like new again,The replacement blade & screen make my Remington shaver work like new again! They are easily changed in seconds.
3,Good but Problems,"I have used Brauns for years and this has some benefits but also some negatives by comparison....*very close shave. Closer than my Brauns. Although I have a couple stubborn hairs it has trouble with.*Battery is very long lasting*my face is sore after using. This was NEVER the case with any of the Brauns i used. I can lessen this by using less pressure, but it never really goes away.*as you will see in multiple reviews above, the trimmer catch is a problem. Mine will no longer stay down. this has been reported over and over.Overall, not a bad deal for the price. But be aware of the issues."
1,A meat grinder!,"The old Remingtons in years past were very good shavers, so I bought this one with confidence. However, after only about a dozen shaves the screeens were already full of holes worn in them. I was very gentle with this shaver and kept it very clean. There's no excuse for such a failure. I threw it away and didn't waste any more of my time with a company that I'm sure would place the blame on me. They fooled me once, and that's the only chance they're getting. For now I'm shaving the old fashioned way with a razor, and will probably continue to. The majority of electric shavers are ridiculously overpriced and are no comparison to the quality of shave you get with a real blade."
3,It's good but not great,"I had a unit similiar to this and actually thought I was buying the same one. It's good but not great. It doesn't tell you when fully charged. Also, if you run the battery down it will not go direct from the outlet. So you have to leave it plugged in for 10min then come back to get 4 more min of shave in. To top it off it only shaves okay so you have to keep going over the same area. I'll guess my old unit is the 3000 series but the numbers are rubbed off. It's clearly the same general unit and in the same family. I'll be looking for the upgraded version which has all of the above covered."
4,Saves time money and gets the job done,"This shaver is great, it lasts for about 2 weeks without having to charge it and it gives a great shave. I have very thick facial hair, sometimes having to shave twice a day and each time it cuts it just as well as a straight-edge razor. I have had it for a year and have gotten great use out of it. We finally, have a razor made by a great brand that gets the job done in half the amount of time as a straight edge razor. If you are looking for a razor that will give you a close shave I say buy this one!"
4,Remington MS-3100 cordless shaver,"Purchased this MS3-1000 cordless shaver to replace later version, the MS3-200. Price/Value scale, it was worth the purchase. Functionally, the 3-1000 is exactly the same as the 3-200 except for absence of red low battery light. Cutting ability is above average. I had Norelco rotaries and was not impressed with them, no matter how I tried to rationalize the purchase. It has been over a decade since I purchase rotary. I just prefer the inline and trimmer. Overall, for the price this model is worth it if not for anything but for its utility value. Simple and straight-forward."
2,not happy with it,"Replaced an older remington with this one since the screens were worn out and the old one wasn't cordless. This one doesn't give as close a shave as the old one. Also after using it for a while, the pop-out beard trimmer won't pop back in."
2,Poorly Constructed,Must admit it was the closest shave I've ever had with an electric razon. Unfortunately it has a few drawbacks. Replacement blades and screens are currently unavailable or difficult to come by. Durability is a serious issue. Trimmer will not stay down and is jammed in up position. Shaver jammed and does not work after six months of use. Unfortunately an$80 lesson in purchasing the wrong razor.
4,Damaged shaver screen,"First time I used the Remington electric razor, I scratched my face with a sharp piece of the screen that was damaged. A piece of the metal on the end of the screen is protruding making it impossible to adequately shave with it. Currently waiting for a replacement screen."
3,AAAAlmost!,"I received the shaver in very good condition. Everything went well until I plugged in the wall charger. Nothing!! No charge light no nothing. Well after breaking the screw mounts and realizing I couldn't return it, I found out that the wall charger was defective. I just so happened to have a remington charger for another shaver and plugged that one in; with a little alteration. Low and behold its alive.So before you slam your refurbished unit to the ground or break it to see if it indeed has batteries, condemn the charger!! Three Stars for my troubleshooting!!!"
3,Remington won't stand behind refurbished product,"My husband loves this particular model and his old razor broke. I found this refurbished one exactly like his first model and purchased it. The screen got a large hole within a week of using it and after contacting Remington they said they can't send a replacement part because it was refurbished. Luckily the screen was still good on his old razor, so I swapped parts."
5,remington razor,"I travel a lot. I have this razor and have been using it for several years. This is the best razor I have ever owned. I switched from the other popular brand about 15 years ago. On a trip I left the charging cord in a hotel. The hotel claimed they couldnt find it. I tried to purchase a new charger. I found one for (the cheapest) $19.95. I started looking for a new razor at Amazon.com. I found the complete razor with adapter for just another $8.00. The product was delevered in three days. I am very happy with the product, the price and the shipping time"
2,It's OK if your in a rush,"This shaver never could seem to get all the hairs, particularly below the neck. Works ok if you really need a quick shave, but doesn't cut near as close as a regular straight razor."
2,Premature battery death,"I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product. With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months. After that, it's time to either ship it to an 'authorized repair site' and incur a big fee or plunk down more cash for a new one."
1,Horrible,"I bought the product and not 2 weeks after using it the trimmer feature broke. I returned it to the store and exchanged it for the same thing giving it a second chance. With in a months time the same thing happened..... I lost my reciept and just excepted my loses. No wonder you can by this on clearance on ..., I just saw it on clearance for [$$$] at .... Think twice about buying this shaver."
3,Remington MS-3-1000 Cordless washable shaver razor,"I found it to be satisfactory for the time being, it holds its charge for a week and it's easy to clean,the one drawback is it seems to take a good bit longer to complete the shave than my old Remington two blade. I'm sure I'll go back to the two blade when I'm ready to order another."
1,Never Received It,"Am still waiting for this ""Christmas"" gift which will now have to be a birthday/good report card/future Christmas gift!"
1,It's crap!!,"Doesn't keep time well, in fact we must reset ours once per week. No online support available."
1,it is a junk,"I bought it last week and used almost everyday. After a week, it didn't work anymore. When I thought about having it fixed, company didn't support for anything. I had to pay for the shipping cost back and forth on my own expense which would cost more than the product itself. I then decided to throw it away."
2,it's alright,"it tends to burn the rice on the bottom, so you just have to watch it and stir it every 10 min."
1,Burned!,This is the worst cooker going! I used it 5 times and by the 3rd it was buring all the rice at the bottom. Then it decided to stop working all together...will not turn on! Forget this one...spend more and buy a good one. The last one I had was from Japan and it lasted over 12 years!
1,do not buy this product,"I bought this rice cooker last Dec. 7, 2003 and it stopped working April 1, 2004. WHAT AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE. fOR $14.95 YOU GOT WHAT YOU PAID FOR. salton is not a good brand. just warning you about this product. I should really have listened to all the reviews before buying it. You are better of buying a Panasonic or Sanyo, a Japanese brand."
2,I had 3 and they all died...customer service was nice though,"I bought my first one about 3 months ago. It died after a month. I returned it thinking, ""It couldn't happen twice."" Then the second one died. Both deaths occurred during cooking after about 10 uses.I called the customer service people at Salton, and they said it was probably a bad batch. They sent me a new one by mail. That one died after about a month.I called the customer service people again today, and they are sending me a different model.The older version of this model worked for me for 8 years. The only problem I had was that the power supply was tricky - if I didn't plug it in a certain way, it wouldn't turn on."
1,Short lifespan,"I have used my rice cooker a total of ten times over the last six months. The first nine times, it cooked perfect rice. The tenth time, it died mid-cycle and has yet to work since.Definitely avoid this product."
1,Two died after first use,Bought one and it cooked great the first time.2nd time it died part way through.Called customer service and they were great.They shipped a new one w/o requesting return.2nd unit cooked great the first time.2nd time it died part way through.
1,"cheaply made, buy another brand","bought this rice cooker a month ago and was able to use it four times or so before it died. so i took it apart and i think i've found the problem, there's (a fuse?)SEFUSE in one of the interior wires that's maybe a centimeter long and looks rather fragile. as far as i can tell it's either that or the heating plate itself that doesn't work. my family has another rice cooker that's lasted for maybe a decade compared to this one's poor showing of only a month."
3,Worth the money (take that as you will),"We've used this rice cooker for over 6 years and it finally broke today (randomly, as well). So...$15 over 6 years isn't so bad. As long as you know what you're doing, you can make decent rice with this. It doesn't have any other bells and whistles, but what do you expect for $15?"
1,Waste of money,"This rice cooker worked fine the first time I used it but shorted out the second time. Don't waste your money on this rice cooker, Panasonic/National makes a better made one for only a couple of dollars more."
1,Waste of money!,This cooker made great rice...for a grand total of 3 uses before it broke! It also has a very thin and easily dented aluminum bowl that is NOT non-stick. There are better cookers out there for comparable prices. Don't waste your money!
4,works great for us,"Perfect size for 2, quick and easy, makes great rice. We've only tried basmati rice, but the rice cooker does a nice job with it."
5,Good Product...Great Price,My family has used this cooker for 10 years. Never a problem. We use it at least once a week. A little soaking and it cleans easily.I was originally suspicious based on its low price compared to the competitors but have been very pleasantly surprised.
2,Mine lasted a little longer...,"Well, I had a little more luck than the other people who wrote reviews--my cooker lasted an entire month (with about 2-3 uses per week) before it mysteriously died. My roommates and I never had a complaint about the quality of the cooking though. If it hadn't quit working for no reason, I'd be quite pleased with it.However, as it stands, I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Could be better....,"As was indicated in several other reviews this rice cooker does leave ""burned"" rice on the bottom - though the manual does say to expect this. My biggest issue is the ""boil over"" problem. I've looked into every solution in the troubleshooting part of the manual but I still end up with a counter full of water. I'm experimenting with less water/more rice, etc. but I just wanted an easy way to cook rice. Rice comes out good but I'd never buy this model again."
1,Awful product even when functioning,"My cooker has never had any electrical problems, but it may as well since I'll never use it again. The directions were inaccurate, it spewed liquid rice out the top in every direction, and it badly burned the rice anywhere it touched the bottom or sides of the pot. Worse, the pot became badly scratched after I repeatedly had to chisel burnt rice-crust off of it, and after awhile the rice began to have a metallic aftertaste. I would not buy this product again at any price."
1,Cheap and messy,"I owned this rice cooker for less than a year before it stopped working. Even when it was in working order, the rice stuck to the bottom & burned, and fluid overflowed through the top causing quite a mess each time. Definitely not worth the price even though its one of the cheaper models available."
3,A Couple of Questions to Ask Yourself,"I just got my Salton because a Crofton 3-cup cooker that I had gave out slightly after the 1-year warranty was over. I liked my Crofton (I mainly make my stone cut oatmeal cereal in it each morning) and figured all little rice cookers would be similar so I bought in a hurry without reading all the specs. 2 questions I wish I had asked first: Does it have a nonstick surface, and Does it automatically switch to Warming Mode when it is done cooking? The Crofton did both, the Salton neither. Actually the Salton only cooked one batch and then quit working but the company was very nice and is sending me a UPS label and will cover the shipping costs both ways which is quite impressive."
1,Not even worth 10$,"The rice cooker boiled over, cooked unevenly and burnt in spots. The metal insert is flimsy. If you make a lot of rice, invest in a good one, or just do it the old fashioned way --- in a pot."
1,Twice bitten!!!!,I first ordered one of these rice cooker/steamers and it did not function after its first use. I sent it back and received a new one and it also broke after two uses. I still have it but it will not work at anytime. I highly recommend not ordering this product because all its good for is a room ornament! It is a very cheply manufactured product!!!
1,bad as other bad reviews,"I got it when the price is $9.99, I thought it's a good price then. Oh, it's even much cheaper now.After I used it for 4 times, it couldn't work any more."
1,get something else,it stopped working after 2 months... might as well invest in something that may last a little longer
1,Broke after 3rd use!!!,"It made ok rice, but not any better than a pot on the stove. It is now on its way to the recycling center. A waste of money."
2,1 month rice cooker,Here today Gone tomorrow. Got it for $10. Did not expect much. Use the rice bowl to hold cut vegetables now.Dont expect and you wont be disappointed.
1,Last Salton product I will deal with,Failed after two uses. Put your money toward something of better quality.
1,Died on second time cooking.,"I Ordered first time, Died on first time cooking.Thinking its a defective piece, called Customer service and reordered the Salton Rice cooker second time.Died for second cooking.Called back to the customer service to get my refund back.Excellent customer service.Keep it up!Recommending not to buy this product."
1,Good rice cooker...until it breaks,"Received this rice cooker as a Christmas gift in 2001, and six months later it broke. Because it made pretty good rice, there's only two of us in my household, and it's only $... we decided to try this same rice cooker again...and decided we'd send the warrenty in this time. Well THREE months later the second cooker died on us. We decided it wasn't even worth it to get another one through the warrenty...it would probably just break in a few months. We'd rather have a rice cooker that's going to work for more than 10-15 times, so we've moved on to a more expensive rice cooker"
1,Worse Electrical Design Ever,"After one month this slow and small rice cooker died. I used it no more than 10 times. It seems the electrical system and wiring is horrible. So, everyone please don't buy this product, it doesn't work more than a long time. It is evident by all the responses of customers"
1,"Terrible Product, do NOT order it!","I have had two of these and both broke almost immediately. This isn't worth even the $12 price. Do not order it, you'll regret it!"
1,Defective - junk,"I purchased two of these when they were $9.99 and thought that all of the horrible reviews could not really be true.I planned on using one and giving the other as a gift but afterI used mine twice, it refused to work anymore. Thank goodness Idid not give the other one as a gift.They are on their way back to Amazon for a refund.SALTON should save their reputation and recall this model and destroy them."
1,Scorched Rice Crust,"I shouldn't have gone cheap. The cooker literature claims it turns itself off when the water has been absorbed, but in reality I ended up with a 1/4 inch deep crust of dried rice. I tried several times with both white and brown rice, and even changed the water quantity to see if more water helped. It didn't. Very disappointing."
2,spend your money elsewhere...,"My mom bought me this rice cooker because she was sick of me cooking rice with a pot. She should have just saved her money. The rice burns on the bottom, the lid cracked and became unusable after a few months and the rice never tasted that great either. Look to zojirushi or elsewhere."
1,Didn't even have a chance...,"This ""rice cooker"" died right out of the box. Couldn't even turn it on the first time. Trashed it right away.The best features of this ""rice cooker"" are the scoop and measuring cup. They are still working today."
2,Lid fell apart after 1 month,"My daughter and I love rice, so we got the Salton 3-Cup cooker. It makes wonderful rice and has worked well for us over the last 4 weeks. The only problem I have with the cooker is the handle is a plastic knobby with a bolt through a hole in the glass... the plastic knob is becoming stripped and now comes loose during cleaning. The handle has to be readjusted (after collecting all the parts from the bottom of the washer) everytime we make our rice... and we have used it almost daily since christmas.Other than the bad design of the lid though, I like this cooker. It makes perfect rice and the pot cleans up with very little effort.I will need to get a new cooker soon, and it won't be a Salton unless the lid design changes."
5,great,"i have had this rice cooker for almost two months with use of two to three times a week and it has worked great! although, i am probably jinxing myself now!"
1,Ready Rice! NOT!!!,"UPDATE: Take back anything good I said about this item. It shorted out (almost had a wire fire) in under a year - I should've returned it but just tossed it instead. DON'T BUY IT!!!I bought the Salton 3-cup rice cooker over the negative reviews of several people. However, with a little tweaking, it does what I want it to do perfectly! The criticism that rice sticks to the bottom happened only one time. After that,I started to add a bit (a TBS or 2) more water than the book recommends, and sometimes I put a tiny drop of oil on the bottom & spread it around w. paper towel or fingertip. No more sticking! The criticism that it boils over? ONCE that happened to me, & that was when I tried to cook Trader Joe's Harvest Blend multi-grains & pasta in it. This cooker does brown rice and quinoa for me with no problems. We're just 2 people & the bigger, fancier ones were not for me."
4,RiceCooker,I love this little rice cooker. It lasted most of my college years (quite a feat for any appliance) and never burned or browned the rice.
1,Harder to cook rice in this than in a pot.,I was hoping for an easy way to cook rice. It certainly doesn't work well for that. I tried several times in this and have given up. Will go back to a put for now.
2,Not the best.,"This isn't the best rice cooker, but it's good for single people who live alone and don't have dinner parties where they need to make a lot of rice. Mine lasted a long time, but you can't make over 2 cups of rice. If you go for the full pot, it will bubble over and you'll be cleaning your kitchen again. Another thing is, it slightly browns on the bottom with one cup. 2 or more cups, and it practically burns on the bottom. I bought a Black & Decker one after I got married which holds up to 6 cups, and I like it a lot better, plus I don't have to worry about it burning on the bottom."
3,you can find better,"I bought this because of the great reviews it recieved. It does a nice enough job cooking rice, its small and compact, overall im happy with it.One annoying problem is that no matter what i do it leave a layer of burned rice stuck to the bottom, easy enough to clean out but still annoying that I have to clean it out. Just spray some hot water on the burt rice let it soak a moment and wipe it out with a rag."
1,Piece of Crap,The rice cooker broke without any reason after I used it for only 2 months. And there is no information on the package where I can return or have it fixed.
1,Guaranteed to fail?,I bought two of these cookers and both of them stopped working after a few uses. Wish I had read the comments posted by the other two reviewers. There is something seriously wrong with this product.
1,Leaves a big mess,"Although I followed the directions carefully, the water boiled over and left a big dirty mess on the cooker, the countertop, and down my kitchen cabinets. I replaced the rice cooker with another one, which behaved the same way. So now I'm cooking rice on the stovetop, because it's less messy and requires less cleaning. I'm looking for a better quality rice cooker that will steam vegetables while cooking the rice, thereby saving electricity (and pollution)."
4,Great results!,I've found this rice cooker to work very well for my first rice cooker. I followed the manual directions carefully. A friend recommended that when the cooker shuts off stir the rice well for evenly cooked rice then let it sit for a while before serving. I usually add the water just past the line if it is too dry. The machine cooks brown rice nicely as well.
1,Unreliable -- it broke after I used it 5 or 6 times,"The machine cooked rice just fine at first, but then it broke after I'd only used it five or six times. It was cooking, then it made a burning smell and shut off after about 10 minutes. Now I plug it in and flip the switch and nothing happens -- it's dead.I recommend AGAINST buying this product."
1,Doesn't cook rice well...,"...and isn't that what a rice cooker should do?! I have had this rice cooker for years, used it numerous times and it never, ever has cooked a batch of moist, fluffy rice. The rice is either hard and undercooked, or a mushy blob. Scorching and burning are frequent. I keep trying different types of rice and different ratios of water:rice, but nothing has worked. I am FINALLY getting it out of my kitchen. Spend a little more money and get a better model to start with!"
2,stopped turning on after 1 month,"I bought this rice cooker for about $10, and I guess I got what I paid for. I was so happy with it when I first got it because it was nice and small (and inexpensive), and I didn't need a huge one for just a few cups of rice that I usually make.I took very good care of it, and it made great rice for about 5 times. Then, I took it out to use it and it just never turned on. I see now that other reviews mention this problem as well. It has a 1 year warentee, but I would have to ship it back to get it fixex/replaced, and that cost would be more than what I paid for it, so I just never did. Now I have a cute, clean piece of kitchen clutter. I'm now shopping for a new one."
3,adequate,"This was my first electric rice cooker; I have had it about four months so far. It has been adequate--the rice is better than from the stovetop, but not as good as the better rice cookers my friends have. It also has an aluminum pan and the rice sticks to it really bad. (This is typical of all aluminum pans). Get nonstick if you can. This cooker does not seem to cook as thoroughly as others, a lot of tweaking with water is necessary. Other than that, for the price it has been OK for a first cooker. As for longevity, four months and going strong still. The screw on the glass lid needs tightening often, also, which is typical in this price range."
1,Stay away!!,I bought 2 of these and they both died within a week. I returned one and used the other as a lesson learned. It doesn't even make a good paper weight!!
1,Learned my lesson,"I had one that broke after 2 months, then bought another one that broke within a week. I did some research and it seems to me Tatung brand rice cooker has a reputation of lasting for 10+ years, it's made by the Taiwanese, who should know a thing or two about rice cookers. Take my advice, do NOT buy this piece of junk!"
2,Mine died too!,"I've had mine for over a year now, and I've probably used it 20-30 times total. Anyway, it died today. :(Btw, it was very hard to clean compared to a non-stick rice cooker."
2,Doesn't go the distance,I bought this one a couple of months ago locally. Worked great about the first 15 times and then died in the middle of a cooking session. Definitely sold me on the idea of using rice cookers. I'm only online to buy another one.
3,no auxillary,there is no auxillary center on this plug where the trailer breakes are on some trailers. LEDS are good but make sure it is what you want.
5,Ecellent Product,I bought this product as a gif for my Mom who is diabetic. She says they are delicious and she cannot tell that they are sugar free.
5,"the naked therapist, a true life telling book","Lenna puts into paper the whole package of life as it is, a true telling book that brings me to live life fully, owning accepting and experiencing the whole range of feelings, from pain and sadness to joy and love. It is not a ""how to"" or ""quick fix"" book, is a novel, a trip to my unconscious agenda, that trough the lives of Hank and Hanna and her other characters I mirrored my own life. Now I don't run away from my feelings, I let them in, and live lighter, it's a portable therapist that centers me. Thanks lenna"
4,Worth checking out,"Besides being for the Mac Power User, this book would be a great to give to a Windows Power User who is new to the Mac. It skips most of the stuff you can figure out on your own (coming from Windows) and gets right into the things that make a Mac a Mac. All the stuff you would expect is in the book or, in the case that it isn't, it refers you to other books that do.It does a good job as a reference book, it's not really a start to finish read. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking to move up from ""beginner"" Mac user or making a lateral move from Windows Power User."
5,Great Book,Doesn't waste any time with fluff. Just dives in to interesting details and what you want to know.
5,Saved my old memory and photos from old cellphones,"I upgraded to iPhone. But I have several old cellphones from Verizon.I am trying to transfer the photos in my old cellphones to my computer. But I cannot do it by connecting old cellphones directly to my computer.Finally, I found this package.It come with all cables, and a smart software, it can import all your photo, calling history, message, address, etcc to your computer.that's more than what I need.and it also comes with a lot of cable that help you connect different cellphones. I think those cables will worth more than $100.So, Good value. And very helpful"
1,Only has Eight (8) Phone Connection Limit!,"There is a very small detail I overlooked when purchasing this product. It can be found in VERY small print at the bottom of the box:""DataPilot software is for personal use only, therefore you can connect and transfer data to a maximum of 8 different mobile phones.""WHAT?!?!?!? THE KIT COMES WITH 10 CABLES!! AND YOU ARE TELLING ME I CAN ONLY USE UP TO 8 OF THEM!!!!I bought this thinking I could use it on my friends and family's phones to help them out too.I did my research before buying but missed this VERY big point.Only get this if you intend to ever connect 8 or less devices. Otherwise you will be VERY disappointed."
1,"Software-mediocre at best. Customer Service - ""-0""",Worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Stay away from any of this company's software or products!
2,Feels cheap & not worth the 30 bucks (with s&h),"The only reason why I gave it 2 stars (and why I probably wont return it) is because that it has the exfoliating attachment (for applying facial scrub).As far as the cleansing head goes - I already have it [for free] since I purchasedConair MDF2R Facial Sauna With Timer. And the ""massage head"" is complete junk - as it doesnt even get the job done (conair piece is much better for moisturizer & massage - as it as sponge vs. some stupid plastic bouncing on your head)."
3,Does this REALLY work?,"I have heard that these work very well and have seen them advertised on TV; though this product is not for everyone. If you are thinking about buying this you might want to go get a proffesional facial, and find out if you getting this product is recommended."
5,A great series,"This set of books has three kids that demonstrate positive characteristics such as honesty, creative thinking, helping others and so on.In this mystery a king is kidnapped and then a young prince is kidnapped.The three young children in this series eventually solve the problem.My young son enjoys this series. It is written to an interest level of about 7 to 10 years old. It is written with a reading level at about a 2.5 grade level.Enjoy."
4,For whom should there be restitution?,"This is not a 'page turner', but the information within its pages is a heart rending opinion turner. For any Christians who thought that this Middle Eastern crisis was about the Palestinian displacement, they will be stunned at the slaughter,political and physical demise of the previously Christian majorities that had inhabited the Middle Eastern regions for thousands of years along with their Jewish neighbors before the forced conversion or death or 'dhimmi' status to Islam through conquerors and expulsion. It will also be an eye opener for Muslims, who like the rest of us, have been kept in the dark concerning this carefully ignored, hidden, conveniently forgotten history of those Christian and Jewish millions who were dispersed, robbed of their heritage, their homes, and their money.It should be required reading in high school, so that people come to their opinions based on facts and not spin."
5,"Suprised, Anger, Relief , Joy","This book is better than reality tv. It is a collection of real life accounts, diary entries, and pictures of black women in America during slavery and after emancipation.It includes excerps from slaves, doctors, teachers, writers, womens rights and black activists, maids, cooks, laundresses, etc.It gives a real life account of what was really going on in the 1800's in black america.The book made me laugh, cry, get angry, etc., while reading it I went through a barrage of emotions.Among its entertainment values, it is also very educational and informative. I had no idea that there were black female lawyers and Doctors in the 1840's in the US. Some of these people were the first female lawyers and Doctors in the US.By and far it is good reading whether for fun or information."
2,"Dull, overly verbose","I found this overly comprehensive analysis of the relationship between society and science difficult to read and less than rewarding. While Bucchi presents some interesting concepts, he lingers too long on others, and mixes overexplanation with underexplanation. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't extremely drawn into the subject matter (or forced to read it for a school course as I was)"
2,Got ya COVERed...,Book is in fair condition. Looks like a dark liquid was spilled on the front cover....quite disgusting actually. Not impressed. o:
5,Fun for the Whole Family,CDB (See the Bee) is truly a wonderful book of letter puzzles everyone in the family will enjoy. William Steig has included his colorful cartoon pictures to help decipher the puzzles and once you and your youngster(s) get the hang of it you'll be able to figure out even the hardest ones. There's even an answer key included at the back of the book. This book is a treasure for the whole family to solve and solve again. A must for all home libraries.
5,Genuine Remington replacement blades and screens,A very competitve price for these parts and delivered promptly. Far easier and less expensive than buying off the shelf at the big box store.
5,good price.. delivery good enough,I buy these two at a time to get free shipping.. best price.. free shipping.. can't get much better than that..
2,A hole in the foil after 1 month's use,"Like two other reviewers my shaver developed a hole in the foil within a month or so of use. I'm going to get a replacement foil and try once more, but if that one goes quickly, the shaver will go in the trash."
5,Replacement Screens & Blades,Located these replacement blades at a MUCH more reasonable price. Ordered two for a second razor. Both arrived and work great.
3,remington unnresponsive MS3-2700 shaver,I also purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face as well. I also have been unable to find replqacement screens and cutters. I e-mailed remmington and they told me to pack sand. This is a good product but the replacement parts need to be replaced to often and finding them is impossible.
4,Get longer use from your cutter,"I have owned an MS3 TCT for almost 10 years and love it. Many of you may have already figured this out cause it seems like common sense, but here is a trick to get double the life from your refills.Pop out the titanium cutters that sit in their triagle looking case and flip them over, exposing a new cutting edge. Bam! 4 more months of use, just like that."
4,replacement screen and cutters,They were easy to install and greatly improved the performance of the razor.
3,Foils only replacement answer,"I replace a foil screen about once every 3 months, what I would consider normal. I always order an SP-94 (cutters & foils) and an SP-93 (foils only) at the same time so that I can replace the cutters as I go through 6 foils. I also ignore the instuctions to replace all the foils at the same time -I only replace one at a time. Pretty economical that way compared to blades."
4,good replacement...,"It's getting harder and harder to find this in stores, and this is a good enough replacement for my shaver. Nothing remarkable, just gets the job done until this shaver finally wears out and I have to upgrade...Price is comparable to what I had to spend in stores and with Prime usually ships free for me."
5,Remington Electric Razor SP-94 Microscreen 3 Replacement Screen & Cutters,Amazon price was the best I found on the internet and the product appears to be original Remington Shaver parts.
5,Remington SP-94,This product is hard to find in stores. Shopping at Amazon makes it so Easy! I also found the price is better.
3,Holes for me too!,I bought one of the microscreens and shortly it developed the infamous hole and cut my face everytime I used it. Couldn't find any replacement screens anywhere so I removed the blade from beneath the screen with the hole. Have been using it like that for about a year now. It still scrapes a bit but no more cuts :)
5,Slammin!,"Wow, Bad Boy Joe Is the new Louie Devito!! This should be called NYC underground party! This Pales into comparison with the new NYC Underground party #7 CD. GET IT NOW!"
2,Bring your copy of Elements!,"I'm still working through this text but I should warn prospective buyers of one thing: The book's early chapters makes heavy references to Euclid's propositions in his books The Elements. I don't just mean references like ""Remember that Proposition 43 from Book 2 that says..."". No, would that it were so. He'll just give the number and assume you've got your copy of Elements handy.In that way, it's not really a complete survey of geometry from the start. You'll want to order a copy of Elements with this book. Dover publishes eleven of the books in two volumes."
2,Just OK Balance Discs,"I've used several balance disks before, and these are pretty disappointing. The edges should be more rigid so it doesn't feel like stepping on an under inflated ball. The plastic material is too thin."
3,Core Trainer,"It is OK, I wish it was wider because I keep falling off of it and have to readjust my feet and I only wear a 5 1/2 shoe! But if you can get on it and stay on it for your full rep, it is a good workout tool. I do squats and lunges on it and I get sore!"
4,Great for building core strength,"I bought two of these. I stand on them and do a variety of excercises to build strength in my hips, gluds, abs, and obliques. Great for golf fitness!"
5,Awesomeness!,I use this at home when I can't get to the gym. It works wonders for my back work outs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
2,"Bought two, one broke","I bought two of these to use at my stand-up desk. The overall idea is fine, I prefer them to standing flat-footed. However, there is an air valve that can be used to add air, and the valve separated from the body of one unit and is now bouncing around inside. I don't see any good way to repair this, and the Harbinger website customer service page is not helpful."
1,balance trainer,"I used one of these items recently in physical therapy for balance and ankle strengthening and it worked well. So, I ordered this one from Amazon. Unfortunately, it's seriously underinflated and does not perform as it should. In fact, it is barely useable for the purposes intended. Unfortunately, again, I just missed the expiration date for returns by about a week, so it sits in the corner unused. What a waste of money."
1,Harbinger Core Balance Trainer Review,"I found this balance trainer to be too small and difficult to utilize for full body balance. With less air, one could not stand on it, and with more air, balance could not be maintained as needed for the physical therapy exercises I must do."
3,Class 70's groove,"I really had no idea who Glass house was until I heard one of there songs in a black 70's film named Detriot 9000. Touch me Jesus was just a beautifully written song, almost didnt sound like gospel music, I thought it was just a funky song until the lyrics came in. I dont see you in my eyes anymore is just a classic song. I say buy this if you like that early 70's vibe"
1,this time clock doesnt work no more than two weeks,"only worked for two weeks after I bought it, for sure its not a Digital time clock and advise anyone out there dont ever buy this time clock."
1,you get what you pay for,"I have a store with 20 employees and this machine was purchased to make my life easier. Like others have said this is a time stamp only! You have to manually push down on it to get it to stamp. very hard to allign where you want to stamp and so sometimes you have your in time under your out time and its really confusing. Employees get mad when you pay them less than they worked but thats what the time card is reading. oh and for you employers that are not around all day and want to purchace this for peace of mind, DON'T , because they can easily change the time when your not looking!!!!!! waste of money and I cant return because Office Depot return policy 'If its opened its not returnable' Well how are you supposed to know its a bad machine. Hope this helps out future buyers."
1,Can't recommend this product.,"I think this product would be great if only it had worked. I kept it for about one month and it would not keep time. It was off about an hour either forward or behind everyday. The support I recieved from smartbuyz was to contact Pyramid directly for a replacement. Not only did this product not work but I had to call someone else for support, pay for shipping to and from to get it replaced. I can't recommend this product or company based on my first experience with them. Sorry."
2,Started out good!,Not going into deep details (not worth the time...hence you get what you pay for)Worked great for about 2 weeks. When your busy in the office and guys are needing the machine time reset...little frustrating. Better hope it gives you the right hours or you'll be over paying/under paying your employees
1,Not worth the money,"This time clock worked well for a little over a year (the warranty period) and then gradually started running slower, losing a few minutes each day. An inaccurate time recorder is worse than useless."
2,You get what you pay for!!,"I'm desperate, so I'll keep it. Can't afford the other time machines. This one prints so light you have to have a magnifying glass to read it. Setting the time is a crap shoot to get the right time to peep through the window. We went back and forth removing the cover everytime we moved the numbers to the supposed red slot to align with. Not accurate. It makes a lot of noise. For the moment, my office is in my house so I have to hear the loud click each time the wheel turns. Numbers are on a wheel that turns with the time."
2,TWO! Stopped working on me,"First, these are quite overpriced. But, if you pay that much for something like this, you expect it to work. I purchased TWO a few years ago. One died after a year and a half, the other died after two years. Dead. The wiring in my home is fine, and I kept these clean and ran them on medium. That's crap. Two stars instead of one only because, well, they do clean the air, but a lifespan that short is unacceptable."
1,Mine sucked,I bought two of these units. One stopped working while it was still under warranty so I contacted sharper image to see about getting it fixed. They informed me that it was no longer covered because of new investors or something so I pretty much got screwed. I wouldn't buy one again and I surely wouldn't buy from sharper image again. I did leave negative feedback on their website but they must delete bad reviews because when I looked a few weeks later it was gone. I'm more disappointed in them than the product.
1,Stopped working after 2 months!,"I bought this from Deals4U about 2 months ago, it worked great then out of the blue just stopped working...Would NOT recommend this product. I am going to go to Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond or some place like that to buy one I can return if it stops working! This was a rip off!!!!"
1,Buyer beware,"I purchased one of these 6 months ago. It has already stopped working I paid over $300 for it and now they(sharperimage)are telling me I have to pay to ship it back to them and they will send me a used one to replace this unit. So I paid for a brand new unit that worked for less than 6 months and now I will get a used one, I wonder how long that one will work. I wish I had done more research on this."
1,Don't waste your money,"We own two of these units in my home. They were both purchased less than six months ago. One of them had stopped working (We have been told to just continuously return it when this happens). These units do not work. We have not found that the level of allergens in our home had decreased at all since we bought these units. As a matter of fact, we now have to dust the units as well as the furnishings.I called to see if we could get our money back. I was told that we could get a store credit or a refund. Apparently Sharper Image's bottom line has taken a big hit as word has gotten out that the best-selling product that they have does not work.I will NEVER buy another item from Sharper Image again. What a ripoff!"
1,Causes Ozone Poisoning,Just one of these things effectively crippled my lungs after direct exposure. If you have a home office like a studio it's even worse as you'll get twice the ozone. Can cause sever permanent illness and is the reason Sharper Image went bankrupt. I can't even believe it's legal for them to sell this anymore.
1,Ionic Breeze,It is a piece of junk! Not worth caring home!! JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK TRASH TRASH TRASH JUNK JUNK JUNK
5,Very simple. It works.,I had pretty bad allergies. I went from having a soar throat and sneezing constantly to instant relief the moment i bought and started using this air purifier.I now own two. A desk size model i keep right on my bed stand. I read the consumer reports review but it really means nothing to me when I've seen the instant and obvious improvement i have with my allergies.I also got my gf one because my allergies would always act up at her place. Once she started using it again i had a very noticeable instant improvement.Even better is the San Diego fires have causes so much air pollution. The most harmful being the particles around 2.5nm. Luckily for me the ionic breeze removes from .05 nm and up. Using both mine and my gfs in the same 1 bed room apartment kept the air extremely clean.You might not notice this instant change if you don't have allergies. But just clean the blade once and you'll be a believer. The amount of dust and dirt this thing collects is amazing.
4,Love/Hate,"Seems everyone either loves or hates these Ionic breeze gadgets.I've owned one of the new Quardras for a few months now.1. Every time I clean it the plates are covered with dust and soot.2. It's dead quiet.I suspect a fan driven system could in fact perform better, but considering the dead-silence and the fact that the Quadra absolutely does collect airborne ""stuff"", I'm happy with it.More ""CFM"" would be nice, but not at the expense of more noise."
1,Don't Buy this Item,I just put this Item in the trash. I got it on March 9 and it worked well for three months then the blue light started flashing (not the red clean me light). I looked everywhere for info on what was wrong then after a week it died. THERE IS NO!!! SUPPORT OR REPAIR FOR THIS ITEM. SHARPER IMAGE WENT BELLY UP and no one fixes these units once they break. There's no repacement warranty. DON'T GET STUCK WITH THIS UNIT BECAUSE ONCE IT BREAKS YOUR DONE.
1,Loud machine. Bad customer service from Sharper Image,"The thing works for few months before it starts buzzing. I called customer service. They won't replace it unless you do all they asked you to do, such as shaking the whole machine, using the hair dryer to blow dry the insert, wipe everything clean...... which were very unprofessional. They came with 5-year warranty. Within 3 years, I have been through 5 replacements, and none of any last for over 6 months. It made buzzing sound all the time! After fifty replacement, they said they can't replace the machine for me any longer even with 5-year warranty!! Don't be fooled by Sharper Image. I will never buy anything from them!"
1,Bad Customer Service and Bogus Warranty,"Buyer beware! When this Sharper Image product bombs (and it will), they will refuse to honor their own written warranty, or as in my case, demand that I return the original product at my own expense and then wait MONTHS until they make a replacement from all their broken returns. It was the worse experience ever. Their arrogance is legendary. Save your money. There are cheaper and better alternatives elsewhere."
3,A DVD zone UNUSUAL SEQUELS,"DEAD OR ALIVE 2: THE BIRDS is an unusual sequel to one of the most interesting cult movies of the last ten years : DEAD OR ALIVE. It's not properly a sequel because the two main actors don't play the same characters and the story isn't connected with DEAD OR ALIVE plot.The atmosphere of the movie is also very different from the first DEAD OR ALIVE. A lot less hysterical editings and non-stop action sequences in this film clearly divided in three parts. Between the first and the last part where action movies fans will find back the Takashi Miike they know, the two heroes spend a few days in their native island, remembering their childhood in an orphanage. These sequences are masterfully directed by Miike who confirms here that he's a more than interesting director. Recommended."
1,Did not purchase,"Did not purchase this item. Cannot review what I did not buy, Thanks Bernie. Do not like this review sheet!"
5,Fun and makes a great practical joke.,"Buy several of these and give them to all your Creationist friends! ""What do youmean there's no dinosaurs in the Bible, lookey here you mook!""More fun than Dogopoly, Horseoply, Possumopoly, or Spideropoly all put together.I dont understand why there's no railroads or hotels to buy, but its still fun tolearn about dinosaurs, even if they never did exist!I like to use Flintstone vitamins instead of the regular tokens that come with thisgame and when I pass go I eat them and make a sound like a Pterodactyl laying an egg.Always had a thing for Betty, and I suspect Wilma and Barney were up to something asgiven away by that evil smirk on his face. 5 Drops of Primordial Ooze"
2,not the best meter,"This is strickly a hobby meter at best or for light duty maintenance,they forget to tell you that the meter can only measure in centigrade for temp. and can only measure 20uf of cap. not very much,especialy when most caps measure between 10 and 10,000uf, also you can buy this very same meter at Harbor Freight for $19.95.It is not a bad meter I have had mine for 7 years and beat the crap out of it and it still manages to function, if you are not a technition this would be a great meter for you,but if you are a tech get a meterman or fluke,they cost alot more but they also offer alot more..."
4,Not too shabby,"Pretty good game overall. In many ways it was an improvement over the first in that there were more characters to play as and each had two evolutions instead of just one. I didn't care for the combat style as much as the first rumble arena, but it wasn't terrible by any means. Overall, worth the money if you're a fan."
5,Digimon Rumble Arena 2,I purchased they game for my son and he love it. He play the game every day since he got it.
5,Review,"This book is awesome for anyone beginning their reading courses for elementary education or even current teachers who need to freshen up on their phonics. The book has quizzes after each chapter and also cumulative quizzes after each chapter that includes questions from the previous chapters. Great, informative book. FAST shipping, awesome price. Thanks."
4,Nice case,"Good all around and works well; however, external case gotta go. Sony should have made the case to fit the battery and the memory sticks inside."
2,Good attachments but not strong enough motor,I bought this really to clean my feet from hard callous and the motor just wasn't strong enough. Had to return it.
5,Excellent Watch,"I bought the Tag Heuer Aquaracer Chronograph Watch just 6 weeks ago, and i am very happy with this purchase. It meets my expectations and even surpasses them by far.The look is elegant, stylish and ""timeless"". The materials used are of high quality and the buttons are very precise.I would always buy this watch again!"
4,Very nice watch indeed,"I bought it from Amazon last week with an out of this world price. The product came on time & perfect condition.It is all you can expect from this brand. The watch is large, not heavy, not light. As many said here, the blue is much deep and dark as you may think from the pictures. And it is definetely a good thing. The only flaw of this watch is that the zaphire cristal has not have antireflex treatment, so when you face the watch directly to an artificial source of light, it is reflected in the cristal, bothering you. You might expect this kind of treatment and a quality watch as this is it. Regards."
5,Stunning,I bought this for my husband and it's amazing. He loves it and it looks beautiful on him. Has all the features he wants and you can't go wrong with a Tag.
5,3 cups of tea cd,This is a lovely companion song to the book Three Cups of Tea. I adored the book and it is nice to hear gently sounds that remind me of the power of women's voices and the serenity of eastern sounds.
2,Not a book on tape!,"This was not what we expected! It consists of rather amateurish music and a large disappointment since it was the only thing we brought to listen to on an extended road trip. Next time we are looking for something in a 'books on tape' format, we will be sure to read the fine print!"
5,Wonderful book,I read this with my book club and it was wonderful. Very inspiring story of someone who did something about the problem seen instead of just talking about it!
1,Awful CD,"I was expecting this to be a book on tape, but instead it was a woman singing the same verse over and over again."
1,It is a perfect dull bedtime story.,"I don't find it interesting and exciting. I don't like to see the way the author treats women. Disgusting! It is a waste of money! I won't recommend that book. Sorry for saying these things, but that's how I feel."
4,Crawl in His Head!,"I think that any time a man is being open, honest and no holds barred about his feelings, women need to listen. This book wasn't meant to be entertaining...it's a true story. The man cheated, repented and in the end still lost the best woman for the job! That had to be a blow. I found the book interesting, lies and deceit uncovered...it's a relationship manual ladies! Read this book."
5,"Saxophone, Bass and Drums make a great Trio.","Sonny Rollins, Ray Brown and Shelly Mann are all superb on this 71 minute album. It comprises 6 tunes; three of which have alternate takes added as bonus tracks. The originals and alternates are similarly compelling. Although my personnal favourite is Wagon Wheels, all 9 tracks are excellent.The uncanny sense of space and the Western mood created by the trio make the cd great listening.I am a big fan of Sonny Rollins and his happy, muscular, witty, rich and edgy sound. This album sees all three musicians in marvellous form, with the rhythm section brilliantly creating the illusion of movement.I would recommend this as THE album to buy to begin a Sonny Rollins collection.No words can adequately describe the treat that awaits you; however some may point in the right direction. They are; lyrical, witty, warm and imaginative. Way Out West is most original and is one of my favourite cds."
5,best in the west east north and south,"If you're looking at this review you should own this music. I don't know where this ranks in the jazz pantheon, but I would put it way up there. Rollins was probably the best saxophonist in the world when this was recorded. Shelley Manne and Ray Brown were worthy peers. They recorded this in a few early morning hours and half a century later no one has done the trio better (except maybe Rollins at the Village Vanguard). The extra tracks are as good as the originals. Accessible, beautiful, humorous, funky."
3,Unweildy but informative,"This book has a lot of historical details which can be a little daunting on the first read. It describes several initiation acts and, more especially, the rites involved in erecting buildings (and their importance). Anyone familiar with a Kenninger book will know the format: words squished together, few paragraphs, etc. It's a typical format for this type of book but it's difficult to read. The information was good, but I also expected a lot more - I wanted a lot more on all the rites, not simply the ones during the erection of the building's foundations."
4,The difinitive study,"This is the best book I have found on the subject of the Hunger Strikes of the 1980's. He does a tremendous job of re-creating the pressure that the strikers must have felt and the pain and anguish it caused the families. If anything, I thought that with a name of Padraig O'Malley, a professor at Boston University (or College perhaps, I don't have the book in front of me,) he would be a little more sympthetic to the strikers and the Republicans as a whole."
1,Dated Venom,"Biting at the Grave, now justly forgotten, was intended to revile the ten IRA hunger-strikers whose deaths were creating trouble for Thatcher. O'Malley doesn't do a particularly good job of it; the same sort of slander was being done much better by Paul Johnson. O'Malley--whose absurdly Irished-up name is intended to wrap the green vowels 'round his obvious loathing for all things Irish--is only a servile, native auxiliary.Irish Uncle Toms have never been difficult to find, and for obvious reasons they have no difficulty finding publishers. But even in their grimy company, this would-be author (who's never produced another book, having expended all his venom on this one) stands out as a perfect metonymy for the cruelty, self-serving, and above all the sheer stupidity of the rightwing pseuds of the Reagan/Thatcher era."
1,What is this bulb???,"How is anyone supposed to know what this item is? You just list it as a 50 Watt Halogen bulb, there must be 20 different types of Halogen bulbs!!! The picture even shows three different types.What are you selling???"
4,Great Everyday watch,"I recently purchased this watch to wear everyday, along with my Omega. Impressions are good. It is well built and functions smoothly. Subjective feel of the watch puts it just right behind my Omega (but a few steps back of my Rolex and Patek). Feels good on my wrist (not too heavy or big) and is easy to read even though a black dial face would increase quick readability. The polished metal may prove to show scratches more easily than a brushed surface, but I bought this watch as daily user and expect some signs of wear over time. Overall; a good watch at a decent price."
3,Brilliant ideas but turgid writing style,"Some of Tanner's thoughts on the impact of culture on the church are indeed groundbreaking, but her writing style is far too wordy. Tanner could easily eliminate 50% of the book if she wrote (and apparently thought) in a more economical manner."
4,Anti revisionist,It is popular now to credit Islam for it's contributions to our society. Islam should be credited but it can't hold a candle to Catholicism. I read a history by Cynthia Stokes Brown recently. She cites the Islam contributions but (unless I missed it) not a word about the Catholic church. What nonsense. Not a very good book by the way. I would encourage anyone interested in history to read HTCCBWC.
3,Catholicism: the benevolent source.,"This book reminded me of what I learned in school, but forgot under pressure of the post-modern aggressive form of atheism which credits the church with everything bad under the sun, from sinister Opus Dei members to wholesale fraud. In truth Catholicism can pride itself as being the source of all sorts of benevolence, such as the ground-rules of international law and universal human rights, to name but a few! Mr Woods also reminds us of the sources of Reason, philosophy and erudition, equally easily forgotten now that we are reminded on a daily basis of the perceived contradiction between Faith and Reason. An excellent book, well written."
3,A learning experience,This book is definitely a work out. The book really shows the impact the church has had on the world. The book does focus exclusively on the catholic church. The book is very well documented. He goes through several stories about various catholic clergy's impact in various sciences. The book does focus on the churches impact in the middle ages. The book does show a different perspective on the middle ages. I think any reader will learn something new. A reader will see the positive impact of the church. The book rambles at times with the various stories. A reader will get lost in the details. The book focuses to much on the science stories. The author does have good points about how the church's impact on culture in general. The author has a good conclusion in how he points out the impact on society on the decline of the church.
1,Just half truths!!!,"Few times have I come across a book so dedicated to defend the Catholic Church, which is fine if the author just told us the whole truth, he just uses part of the history to make us believe that the world survived just by the Catholic Church.Two examples from the first three chapters.1.He says that the barbarians were called like that because they were just that: Barbarians. What he did not explain is that the word Barbarian meant in Latin, at that time, was foreigner. The meaning we now give to this word is modern.2. He claims that the inquisition was just a small thing!!!Unless you are a pious Catholic, do not buy this. It is full of half truths."
1,What a Joke,"I saw this guy on EWTN espousing his revisionist propaganda. Illuminating only for its psychological revelations about the author and his attempt rehabilitate the Catholic Church's doctrinal contribution to the darkest ages of mankind. I mean come on, the scientific and industrial revolutions were a product of the intellectual freedoms born out of the Reformation. Give it a rest, the truth shall set you free."
4,"Fantastic, but no chapter about music?","This is an incredible book, thoroughly researched and easy to read. I especially like his point about why scientists in the Catholic Church were influenced by their faith, which furthered the cause of discovery, contrary to what pop culture has us believe. My one bg criticism is that there is no chapter about music. Polyphony, which is several voices moving independently, is uniquely Western and thrived in the church, reaching its height with Palestrina and the Gabriellis. Perhaps in a future edition Professor Woods can add a chapter, or if this is not his area of expertise, he should enlist a musicologist to help. But the book is still excellent."
4,needs more salt,"Woods is great as always, but I was hoping for more categorical, encyclopedic facts. He's too general for what I was seeking. Perhaps to avoid fights with nonCatholics, he just painted with broad strokes. For that matter, it's a good initial introduction into the Catholic Faith for a loved one who is interested.......just don't take them to a N. O. church when your done, or you might lose them......."
3,Author cuts off his nose to spite his face.,"The author goes to great lengths to show how medieval Catholic culture laid the groundwork for modern Western civilization, then ends the book by condemning the very civilization that the Catholic Church presumably built. For example he lauds gothic and then condemns modern architecture. However most architectural historians will be quick to point out that the Carson Pirie Scott building, a modern American masterpiece is based on gothic prototypes! It is unfortunate that the author allows his blatant anti-modern biases to undermine his scholarship, because he does a good job of summarizing recent discoveries on the importance of the early Catholic Church. Had the author stuck to his topic he would have had an outstanding book."
2,Unbalanced,"I was very disappointed to discover that the author presents his subject matter in such a radically lopsided fashion that it is not unfair to characterize it as dishonest. I can't imagine why he would do this. I am a devoted catholic and love the church. I know that the church has done (and continues to do) much that is worthy of the highest praise, for the (salvation and) advancement of humanity! However, to claim that the church is solely or primarily responsible for the creation of, or just about every advancement in art, science, law, industry, etc. is well, excuse me, but not just false, but a ridiculous claim. The contributions of the Mother Church to the preservation and advancement of Western civilization are awesome in scope and value, and out of respect for the Catholic Church, history, and the reader, demand an honest apraisal."
1,A Book for Children?????,"What a ridiculous book. It reads like a children's book in big letters. History is told with brightly colored simplicities like the ""cold scientism"" of the Enlightenment, naturally being followed by Romantic reactions. The high cultural sentimentalism of the Enlightenment, the opposite of ""cold"", of course escapes this poor man's scholarly purview. This whole thing could be put together in a flash by reading the Catholic Encyclopaedia. The whole point of is a political agenda, and in this author's case, some pretty shady ones."
2,A pamphlet under hardcover disguise,"One can only tell so many selected truths, before one is lying. This light (intellectually and physically) volume lends little help to the church. Dr. Thomas is so biased, and so lacking in rigor and desire to sort through complicated issues, that the book is doomed from the first few pages. As a practicing catholic and scientist, I found the treatment of the Galileo affair and of science during the renaissance quite appalling. The church, and truth, deserve better."
5,Great history read for Catholics,"Hard to state how impressed I was with the history as presented. Puts a lot of things into a perspective that makes one proud to be Catholic. The only downside is that the narrative ""sounds"" like a textbook. Which is what is is I suppose... Overlook the dry delivery and focus on the information presented and you will return tho this set of CD's over and over again."
4,A revisionist view,"In light of the European failure to mention anything about its Christian heritage in its Constitution (now going down in flames, country by country), this is a much-needed book. Woods makes his case, discipline by discipline, for the Church's indispensibility in not only religion, but also in culture, law, science and technology. For those raised on the ""Black Legend,"" but who have open minds, this will be a mind-changer. For those who appreciate the Church already, this will be a real blessing."
5,I love the book! How the Catholic Church built Western Civilization.,"Great book that exposes the truth and stops the maddening and stupid cliche and rhetoric that consumes The Anti-Catholics. Whether they are trying to ""convert"" you or like they say ""save"" you. You need to read this book, Your teacher was wrong, your professor is wrong.All other Non-Catholics need to realize what the Catholic church has done for Mankind. If your Catholic this book beautifully reinforces your beliefs and leaves any doubts at the door."
4,"Drys well, but it sure is loud!","I have owned this dryer for about six months. I use it every day, and I can say that it's built tough, and is quite reliable.I have long, thick hair, and wanted a dryer that could cut down my drying time. This design, sure does that!But, one disapointment is that it's too loud. But it does a great job though."
2,didn't work for me - IBS,"Apparently the SCD diet is great for UC and Crohn's, but it did nothing for me. I've had IBS D for a long time, and though I stuck to this pretty religiously for about a month and a half, I saw no improvement. I may try it again after the holidays, but it seems that for most people, there is noticeable improvement immediately, so I got discouraged when I didn't see any."
5,Cured!!!!,"When I picked up this book, I had daily, chronic diarrhea for about 14 months. I had lost 30 pounds over the course of the 14 months. Doctors and GI experts were unable to help. I tried eliminating dairy, gluten, etc. all to no avail. I started the intro diet October 30, 2012. 8 days later my diarrhea stopped. Since then I have noticed bowel improvements daily. The diet is very tough but it's worth it! Follow the protocol and you can be healed!"
2,disappointed,"I followed this diet for over a month with no positive results. I have ulcerative colitis. I really wanted to see progress, but sadly didn't. I hope it works for others, but I 'm skeptical. Perhaps I'll try it again. It does not address the relationship between omega 3 and omega 6 oils, and the balance IBD patients must maintain. This is critical, and should be addressed. I urge anyone with IBD to obtain this info. and follow it. It has helped me a great deal after only one month."
1,Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet,"About a year ago I was diagnosed with Sclerosing Cholangitis. Sclerosing Cholangitis is a liver disease and is usually connected with Colitis. Sclerosing Cholangitis is discover through standard blood tests. My blood showed high levels of Alkaline Phosphatses, AST and ALT levels. The doctor told me there was no cure for this disease and that a liver transplant was likely in my future. However, since being on this diet my colitis improved and my blood test are normal. It took about 6 months. TRY THE DIET! STICK WITH IT FOR 3 MONTHs AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE. It's a difficult diet, but it's better than the alternatives. I definitely recommend this book!!!"
1,Very difficult to follow and not very scientific.,"I followed this diet religously for over two years and have come to the following conclusion. The diet is very very difficult to follow and if it doesn't work for you then the only reason you will be given is that you did not follow the diet religously. There are many items in the book that do not make scientific sense such as ""no items containing sugar are allowed"" however ""bacon with sugar is allowed once a week"". These discrepancies will never be addressed in later versions. My reccomendation is that you ONLY try this diet if you are able to make ALL of your own food from scratch and if you are willing to try this for many many months (again religously) even if it does not work for you.I believe that there is a strong 'Placebo Effect' which makes this diet work for some people."
1,Mrs. Gottschall and her Supporters,"I have been following this book and the support list serve off and on for the past few years and have noticed that Mrs. Gottschall and her supporters will flock to write glowing reviews every time there is a review that contradicts her views of IBD and the cause/treatment of same. The fact of the matter is that the SCD book is based on weak science and 'cures' only a small percentage of IBD sufferers - therefore it is not the CURE for Bowel Disease that BTVC/SCD purports to be. The information contained in BTVC may lead researchers to a more definite cause/effect relationship between diet and IBD, someday, however it is not worth a complete change of lifestyle to find that you are one of the many that BTVC/SCD in its present form does not help."
3,Do Raw instead - go vegan,"I agree with the idea that Colitis/Crohns/IBS are generally caused by some type of bacterial overgrowth... but I strongly, strongly disagree with the idea that a person should eat meat. It is absolutely toxic for your body.I cured myself of 6 years worth of Colitis buy reading 80/10/10 by Dr Douglas Graham ... and was healthy within 1 month eating raw fruits and vegetables. If you want a really solid cure that is good for the earth, the animals, and you... check that out and ditch this!"
5,Don't miss this book,"Well, I really can't say much more than has already been said here. Twelve years ago I got this book. It saved my life. Absolutely, positively saved my life. Two other members of my immediate family have Crohn's disease, yet will not stick to this diet. One of them has been resectioned FIVE times; the other chronically ill and heavily drugged. Meanwhile, my latest colonscopy shows NOTHING yet again. There are great cookbooks for this diet now...there weren't when I started. If you think sticking to this diet is difficult, trying being resectioned...or worse."
5,This diet worked for my IBS-D,"As I write this I'm on Day 10 of the diet (followed 98%, I'd say), and I don't have any symptoms of IBS anymore -- a disease I had to live with for the last 10 years. Doctors and pills never worked for me, this diet already does.After my gut and me are at peace again, which will possibly take a few months of healing, I will move to the Paleo diet, which is a diet very similar to SCD, and it's designed to be followed for life."
4,Breaking the Vicious Cycle,"This is the book I've been looking for. What to eat with other things, what not to eat with other things. What to eat, what not to eat for certain diseases. Excellent book."
5,Breaking the Vicious Cycle,"We got this book from the library along with several other books on the subject. The other books were slicker, more professional looking, so we left this one for last to look through. It reviewed several medical problems that did not concern us, but when we got to the general description of how the digestive process works and what can go wrong with simple what to do about it suggestions and recipes - well, then we found we could not do without this book and had to buy it. We use is regularly now. By the way, we too are more regular."
4,Alternative Guide to IBD and Diet,"This popular book, written by a biochemist and cell biologist, got its start when Gottschall's daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease at a young age. She developed the ""Specific Carbohydrate Diet,"" a strict grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free regimen, as an alternative to medication and surgery. The diet is intended to starve anaerobic bacteria in the intestinal tract, similar to the use of antibiotics for Crohn's. No clinical trials have been conducted on its effectiveness for IBD as far as I know, but if you are looking for alternative approaches you might try this dietary approach. Visit the IBD Book Store for other reviews on books related to Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, and IBS"
3,Great idea but be careful,"I bought this book soon after being diagnosed w/ crohn's and after going on the diet, I would feel fine one minute and really sick the next. The idea behind the book is fantastic but it's a one size fits all diet plan that just doesnt work for everyone- it didnt work for me b/c even though I only ate foods that are considered ""safe"", I would still experience horrific bouts of pain and actually ended up in the hospital after going on the diet and now I know its b/c I was allergic to some of these foods and it wasn't doing me any good to be on this particular diet plan. So if you decide to buy the book, I would say be careful b/c some of the foods that have been deamed as being safe may not be so safe after all."
3,Din't really work for me.,I had great hope that the diet will work for me.I stuck to the diet since they said that things got worse before it got better but unfortunately for me things continue to get worse expecially the almond flour was not working at all for me so I had to get off the diet. Too bad. I actually liked the diet!
1,Written for a cult?,"My partner has diverticulitis and I was looking for books on diet that would help. Now I am just thrilled so many reviewers find this book worthy of 4 or 5 stars but for us it is laughable! Written by a lady long dead (probably from her diet) it seems to invoke some bizarre cult-like, pseudo-science nonsense God. It is just the pits! For the steep price you get a thin book with LARGE printing. Very few pages are devoted to talking about the diseases she claims to be able to help. Most of the book is a recipe-a-page of some of the most revolting tripe ever thought up. This woman is more ""Vicious"" than any disease she claims to address. A complete waste of money and paper. The only reason it may help others is because of the placebo effect or buyer's remorse: buyer's just want these ""recipes"" to work. Horrible and amateurish junk. Avoid!!!!"
5,Wonderful book which offers excellent results.,"After learning of the SCD diet on the internet, I knew I must buy the book. The book is clearly written, easy to understand and easy to reference. The diet itself is a miracle. I started the SCD in July 2005 and currently have no symptoms of Crohn's Disease. I feel great. It is a bit hard to comply with the diet which, among other things, eliminates wheat, starch, most dairy products, complex carbohydrates. But complying with the diet is a wonderful trade off for eliminating the symptoms of Crohn's. I recommend the book and highly recommend the diet. After 10 months on the diet, not only did I feel better, but my GI tests were all negative for active Crohn's."
3,"Must have VERY good self control, and lots of $ for almond flour to follow...","I have crohn's and this book was helpful as far as teaching me the importance of steering clear of carbs and sugars and starches, however it is very difficult to follow as it allows NO SUGAR and NO CARBS, which sadly enough seems to be a staple of the American diet. It is very expensive to follow such a diet, almond flour costs about 40 bucks a bag and the price of organic meats is outrageous. However it does teach about intestinal health and it has helped me to alter my diet, but it was very difficult for me to follow this diet 100% of the time, I lasted about 3 days, and I definitely had carb withdrawl. I miss bagels...."
3,Not for vegans,"Though this is a clearly written and informative book, it is not appropriate for vegans. The author does suggest that vegetarians can alter the plan to fit there needs there are no details to do so."
4,"great info, could use some better organization",This book has great information on why SCD is helpful and how to get started. My only criticism is that the info is not organized in a clear manner. The lists of acceptable/ not acceptable foods are in paragraph form. I wish they had put things into charts or lists that would make it easier to go to the grocery store with. But overall a very valuable book that I will be using everyday to implement this diet for my child.
1,Be Careful!,I have has ulcerative colitis for over twenty years. I have two children who have the disease as well. I totally understand the desire to feel better when One has this disease. I bought this book on a recommendation. I followed the diet to the letter(really did). I got much worse very fast. I ended up having emergency ostomy surgery after following this diet for several months. I have seen on the email discussion group for this book that some people do have good results from this diet. Just be careful because it does not help everyone and may harm as well.
5,Finally remission without medication,"I was diagnosed with crohn's disease in september 2010, after undergoing an appendectomy. The prescribed medication was ineffective, four months after my diagnosis surgery was required. I had an Ileo-colic resection Jan 2011. The surgeon said it was likely that I would experience diarrhea at least four or five times per day (due to the particular section of bowel that was removed), but that there was medication to treat this. I have been on this diet for a month now and I have not experinced any diarrhea or abdominal pain (which I was so used to experiencing prior to surgery)all without any medications! I am so excited about this book and would recommend it to anyone with intestinal disorders. I have never felt better!"
5,vicious cycle,this book has helped me in so many ways a person could never know... anyone wit a inflamatory bowel disease HAS to have this book ... no doubt
5,Must read and follow for GI health,My family doctor gave me this book upon discharge from the hospital with colitis and celiac sprue disease based on lab work. He had another patient who had tried it with great improvement. I was so sick that I was ready to try anything to feel healthy again. This is an change of eating habbits that you can't cheat on!!! But after a month it seems normal and you feel much better. The recipes are easy to follow and most are pretty good. I have been a registered nurse for over 22 years and this book is highly recomended.
3,Good idea but hard to stick to,"This book set me in the direction of exluding starch and sugar from my diet and yes it helps my crohns. I would recommend reading it for the alternative it offers. I just dont have the discipline for this diet.Unfortunately this diet tries to be a normal diet with muffins and cakes but no flour or starch of any kind. I think Elaine is right about the sugar and starch and the book is worth reading for that aspect alone. If you want to follow this diet check out books like Atkins or the caveman diets, for the menu ideas without starches."
5,Please read this,Please read this book if you or anyone you know has bowell troubles. It will save you.
3,Good book if your problem was caused by bad diet,"I was diagnosed with colitis due to Giardia (a parasite). The doctors didn't know it at the time and I just kept getting worse and worse. I got this book because I was very impressed with the reviews. I followed the diet to a T for several weeks and didn't improve at all.I think the reason I didn't improve is that my colitis was not caused by bad diet, but by Giardia. So if you suspect the cause of your condidtion may be due to a bad diet (white sugar, white flour, junk food), this book may help you.But don't think that the diet outlined here is the only solution. If it doesn't work for you, then something else out there will. Inflammation of the colon can be caused by a whole number of things, and you have to keep looking until you find out what caused yours. I believe every single case is curable."
5,Helpful info,"I appreciate the author's background in science and the way she could explain digestion in layperson's terms. She acknowledges the diet can be challenging, but offers resources to find special items. I also appreciate knowing that following all of the rules of this diet for one month should provide enough digestive improvement to indicate whether or not to continue on the diet for another year or two."
4,it's worth to try,I immediately begin the diet after I read this book. After 2-3 weeks all gas and cramps has gone. But I have lost too much weight. Anyway I will go on staying on the diet because I want to give it a chance to heal my ulcerative colitis.
4,This could work--,"This is one of several books I read about diets and health. My problem is when you are allergic to some foods, then you really can't follow through very well. I think she has the right idea though and I plan to use it as reference."
2,Inspired by ancient diet,"After reading I can summarize. This is a hunter/gatherer diet. Ancient humans had no farms to grow grains or sugar cane. They relied on what was already growing or for sweetening, bee hives. I have Crohn's and carefully log what causes flareups. About one half of what the diet demands is OK the rest is NOT. The idea that ANY spice is OK, totally dumb. I avoid spicy stuff, if I don't I pay the price. Also I avoid all salads with raw leafy vegetables or raw carrots and cabbage, the book says those are OK, not for me! With total discipline on diet but without eliminating sugars or carbs I do well without meds.In short the book goes overboard on things that make no sense to me. Not all intestinal diseases are the same and the diet should be specific to each, instead this book goes way beyond the pale to be one diet that tries to fix everything."
5,Great review of healthy eating,This shows how to avoid the greatest health threat of our time - industrial food and what to do if you have problems resulting from eating our typical western diet.
4,Interesting Guide to Diet and IBD,"This popular book, written by a biochemist and cell biologist, got its start when Gottschall's daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease at a young age. She developed the ""Specific Carbohydrate Diet,"" a strict grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free regimen, as an alternative to medication and surgery. The diet is intended to starve anaerobic bacteria in the intestinal tract, similar to the use of antibiotics for Crohn's. No clinical trials have been conducted on its effectiveness for IBD as far as I know, but if you are looking for alternative approaches you might try this dietary approach."
5,Yeast was making my little boy sick,"We have been SCD since 2/05. We say an almost immediate change in my son. We started SCD after a recommendation from a friend whos daughter was also on it. My son's symptoms were severe diarreha, gas, bloting and because of all of this very cranky and irritable. We determined that he had chronic intestinal yeast (from antibiotic use for severe ear infections) that had taken over his intestines. The yeast was preventing his intestines from breaking down food and absorbing the required nutrients to live. In 2 weeks he went from 10 DBM's a day to 1-2 normal ones. He was much happier and seemed like a ""normal"" child. He is now thriving. He can eat almost anything on the diet. His current favorites are pumpkin pie, icecream and anything with cheese. I believed this diet saved my son's life. I don't know where he would be now if he still was unable to digest food...and I'm glad, thanks to this diet, that I will never have to find out!"
4,Like the book and trying the diet,"Ms. Gotchall has written an excellent book and I am trying the diet. I am not having the success I would like to have with the gluten free diet and my regular doctor, rhuemetologist and chiropractor is telling to to try this diet. If you are having trouble with a gluten free diet I highly recommend this book.The only draw back is implementing the lifestyle. It is helping but staying off of carbs, is harder than I thought it would be. That isn't the book but me....I think it will go better the longer I am on it."
3,Breaking the Viscious Cycle,"This cookbook is a fine way to try out this diet, but alas, and despite all the glowing testimonials, the diet has not worked to ease the symptoms of my husband's Crohn's disease. We've tried it for a month to no avail. He's losing weight and he misses his mashed potatoes, so it's back to those big, bad carbs tomorrow."
3,Good info...poor recipes,"I purchased this book at the suggestion of our developmental pediatrician for a child on the autism spectrum with gut dysbiosis problems. The concept is very helpful, but the recipes are ridiculous! How is a mother of more than one child, including one on the spectrum, supposed to be able to make all of these pizzas and lollipops when the recipes are not clearly written?!!! On top of this we're supposed to be doing floortime therapy 24/7. This is clearly not written by a professional cookbook author. Often the items listed in the recipe are not in the order in which they are to be used. To make the pizza you have to first find the cheese bread recipe, then make your own tomato sauce. Most of the other recipes require homemade yogurt or cream cheese. What sleep, exercise, and nutritionally-deprived parent has time for this?!!"
3,A Very Tough Diet to Follow,"I bought this book, excited that I might actually be able to cure my colitis through Gottschall's diet plan. I was very disappointed to find that the diet takes a lot (I mean, A LOT) of preparation. You would basically have to empty out your cupboards and start again. (Nevermind what the other people in your household might think of this.) I think that if I were really sick, I would go for it and try the diet. But since my colitis is under control with medication, undertaking a wheat-free, sugar-free life seems like a rather monumental task. Also, as far as I can see, the diet doesn't take into consideration that some people are lactose intolerant. But hey, if you're feeling horrible... and you have time to bake wheat-free muffins... Go for it."
4,Book review,Educational. This book could be used as a teaching tool for intestinal health for any problem. A lot of food for thought.
4,great book but most recipes calls for nut products *allergy,"These look to be very interesting recipes. However, I won't be able to use it for our daughter as most recipes calls for ingredients of nuts or nut flour. She has an allergy to most nuts."
4,Breaking the vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Throgh Diet,After being totally confused about what to do about my digestive issues. A friend recommended this book. I have been following the diet for about 5 weeks now and as I have stayed with the suggestions fairly precisely I have found relief. My diarrhea and abdominal pain has stopped and I am eating many more foods than before. I have kept all starches out of my diet and for now this seems to be the correct avenue. I trust that one day in the near future I will be able to add some dissacharide sugars in the form of starches back in without causing upset and disturbance. I have eaten organic Stonyfield yogurt in the place of her home-made yogurt suggestions and this has worked fine for me.
4,Fairly effective,"I purchased my trimmer several months ago. I wasn't happy with it at 1st but I gave it some time. I didn't think that it was cutting anything the 1st time I used it but by the 2nd or 3rd use, I changed my opinion.This thing actually does a pretty good job of trimming nose/ear hair and it's so-so on the private hairs. I still use my electric razor to finish off the nose hairs that this unit can't cut - it's usually the tiny, coarse hairs that's close to the skin.Some people didn't like their trimmer and I can understand why. It's not something that you want to drop. I clean it under water all the time and it has never malfunctioned like another user stated. The cut hairs remain in the nostril so you can see that it does it's job fairly well when you use a tissue."
2,"Effective, cost-efficient, (unintentionally) disposable","As a trimmer, the NE-3 functions beautifully: after a year of biweekly use I have never once felt the discomfort of an unpleasantly pulled hair. However, as a device the NE-3 is not particularly sturdy: after a year's use, and maybe most the life of the battery, the on-off switch ceased to function. For a while I could get it to run by pressing the on/off switch into the trimmer case, but now even that's stopped working.If you're willing to pay $8 for a razor that will likely break after a year's use then this is an outstanding razor to get; if you want one that will last you, then--like me--begin to look elsewhere."
2,Please don't buy this!,"I bought this trimmer two years ago. It's not that it doesn't work but it's just a pain in the neck. The on/off switch keeps falling off. Sometimes it just makes too much noise but hardly trims, and it consumes batteries too fast. I bought another ""famous"" brand name trimmer. I won't mention the name, so that you won't feel I'm trying to undermine this product by promoting another one. But please, don't buy this product, unless you like to have a bad nose hair day!"
1,Dont waste your hard-earned money,I bought this product for my dad and it doesn't work at all.The one at Brookstone's is the best but costly.
1,disapointed,We could not get this razor to work. It felt nice hand held but wouldn't work...even after changing batteries 3 times.I returned this and am looking for an acknowledgment and refund.Thank you.
3,Remington NE3 Nose Trimmer,"I purchase my Remington NE3 in 33 months ago. It trimmed nose and ear hair but took a long time to do a thorough job. It also seemed to leak battery charge because if I left the battery inside the unit, it was discharged the next week. So I always removed the battery. Finally the device would no longer turn on. I'm sure the switch was defective because at first I could make it run by pushing the switch towards the on position, but this procedure only worked once or twice. I liked the product for the low price, but it's disappointing that it didn't last any longer, considering that I used it only about once a month. I think this experience illustrates the terrible quality of things made in China (I assume this was made in China, and that's why it's crummy. I have also recently purchased other small electronic products made in China, and they are also unsatisfactory). Let's start making products in the USA, where we know how to make them right!!!"
5,Works like a charm,"Inexpensive, no painful yanking of hairs, does the job efficiently.Yes, it is embarassing to write a review about a nose hair trimmer. It is not, however, half as embarassing as walking around with rampaging nose hairs. To all those who silently suffer from this problem -- stop using scissors and get a trimmer!As always, blow nose before use. Batteries not included."
1,Quality it is not!,"I purchased one of these only to have it fall apart within a month. Whatever you do, don't drop it! The cutter head assembly fell right off and wouldn't snap securely back on like it should. The plastic construction makes this unit relatively inexpensive at the cost of it's durability."
3,Okay Product,"It does an okay job of cutting nose hair. Uses little battery power. However, the on-off switch broke after 2 years of use. It just came off and I cannot reinstall it."
1,Stay away from this junk,"I bought this product from a local store because I could not find the Panasonic product. This Remington product allows you to bend, but it does not trim. I wish I could assign negative stars to this product. This product did not trim a single strand of hair. Beware...."
1,Poor experience,"I bought this NE-3 Precision rotary trimmer expecting to get the rotary head I saw some years ago from Remington. Unfortunatelly the one I received has rotary blades under a fixed head, not nice design head, and definitelly not doing the job I was expecting to do.For this reazon, I'm waiting ""papers"" to get my money back, hopefully not very long time."
4,Nose Hair Trimmer,"Easy to hold,easy to adjust,easy to clean,comfortable to use, no hair pulling, good price, good gift, good Amazon item....You got to have one!"
1,Ineffective toylike feel,"This product is simply not worth using at any price. It did not cut any of the hairs I needed it to cut. It felt like a dime store trinket. Why I would need to use it wet is beyond me, but some might appreciate that feature. I'm also not sure why it's flexible.Amazon should have some sort of quality control mechanism to keep products like this ""off their shelves."""
3,could be more powerful,The trimmer does its job but could be more powerful. I will probable going to purchase another on to replace this until I am satisfied.
1,Good as a novelty - terrible as a phone,"I picked this up a couple years ago. While it looks great for decoration, its a horrendous phone. The phone cord the unit comes with is ridulously small and plugs in the back of R2. You won't be able to walk a foot away from R2 without dragging him along. The phone handset itself is awful as well. The shape is completely flat and uncomfortable due to it being his arm. The buttons are no better as they are incredibly small. Overall - this thing makes a good piece of decoration but as a phone, it's junk."
2,i don't reccomend this,"unless you are a star wars freak. don't buy this, it is too big and is just a waste of space."
5,Delilghtful Short Stories!,"Short stories (or novellas) are an excellent way to become familiar with new authors so that you can add authors' names to your ""TO BE READ"" list. In this particular book, I was already familiar with Ms. Dodd and Ms. Laurens, but I was unfamiliar with Celeste Bradley and Leslie LaFoy. I am so glad I bought this anthology so that I could meet two new authors! I love romance and the Regency Period is my fave...and I was not disappointed in Ms. Bradley's and Ms. LaFoy's titillating romps between their heroes and heroines. I will be reading more stories by these two ""new to me"" authors, as well as Ms. Dodd and Ms. Laurens. I will also purchase more anthologies in future to continue to meet new authors."
2,Don't Bother,"This book was really not that great. There was no time to develop a story because they were all too short. First one, could have been good, but it was written all weird and confusing. Second one was a little funny, but that's it. Third one was just unbelievable. Fourth one was even more unbelievable and utter crap."
2,Never quite worked right,"Nothing I could do made this cartridge fit and work correctly in my fax machine. I have had difficulty in the past with after marker toner cardridges, but decided to try again. I ended up having to replace the machine"
1,Bad Quality,The cartdidge has very little toner in it and it leaks toner constantly. I would never purchase this product again.
3,Cheap cartridge,"My order arrived on time and in tact, but when I installed the toner the end cap came off and I had spilled toner on my carpet. I was able to insert the toner and rotate it to the correct position before installing the cap.I would have been most happy with this purchase if the end cap had been secured like the factory cartridge it replaced."
4,Read Book Before You Review,"Some of these reviewers apparently have not read the book. They seem to have filed reviews for the sole purpose of ranting about Bill and Hillary Clinton. In Mr. Davis's account of his meeting with the President regarding Miss Lewinsky, his advise was to tell it all and tell it now whatever the truth is.The bulk of his book is dedicated to the campaign finance ""scandals"" where he had to continually contend with other White House counsels who took the tack of not exposing their client to undue risk, often with disastrous results, such as with the White House coffees.If you are interested in the dynamics between the White House and the press, this is the book for you."
2,Half Empty Rather than Half Full,"Lanny Davis takes you inside the spinmeisters den at the White House and tells how the news is made through leaking to the press and how the professionals blunt negative reporting about the President. Overall a quick read, but according to Lanny nothing President Clinton or Al Bore did is incorrect or wrong. Nothing at all; it is all part of the vast right wing conspiracy. I thought the lack of critical analysis shot the wheels off as a commentary, but as a how-to manual on spinning the message this a must have."
4,You get exactly what you expect from Sargent in Sullivan,"I suppose most people know what to suspect here; a series of light overtures which are enjoyable but - as opposed to what English reviewers tend to say - not particularly memorable. Sargent knows, of course, how to bring out the best of them in terms of humour and lightheartedness. The Pro Arte Orchestra is not the Berlin Philharmonics, and the playing is sometimes a little rough. Sound quality is a little rough as well - these recordings frankly show their age - but for an affordable collection of these pieces, I think this is still the top choice."
2,Not like homeade,"This gadget might be fine for the beginner. After years of mixing and rolling my own, I found that the press tended to blow the tortilla apart and the cooked flavor was extremely bland without the cast iron pan to cook them in. There was no browning at all. The press did flatten the tortilla to a semi-acceptable thickness, slightly thicker in the middle"
3,"Not bad, but not great","I agree with most of the other reviewers, but I didn't think it was as bad as some of them did. The design does make a sightly uneven tortilla and it isn't going to be like the ones cooked in a cast iron pan. My thing is that you should not expect homemade goodness when it is not really homemade. I have had mine for several years and it hasn't broken, but I might use mine less often than others. It is acceptable for wraps or just to quickly roll out your dough, but don't expect excellence. I am satified, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Virtual Snooze!,I bought it because I had heard it was a good flick! Well after watching it I gave it to my brother. Save your money.
2,Awesome soundtrack not much of a movie,Movie basically only consist of virtual reality sexual encounters but what kept my interest with the movie wasn't the video but an awesome soundtrack. In fact that is the only reason for me purchasing this video. This movie would be a 1 star the music makes it 2.
2,Not nearly as good as Virtual Enounters 1!,"The original film was about a girl checking out this erotic virtual reality machine, and it was hot! This sequel is mostly about some guys and their adventures using the same basic machine. My verdict: too many guys, not enough babes!"
2,Bad times,"VE2 has a ton of potential, but it just doesn't work out. Brandy Davis is both cute and sexy, of course, but Playboy's Testing the Limits is a much better showcase for her, um, talents. Not to be mean, but most of the film's other women just aren't that attractive, and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack. Contrary to a previous reviewer, the massage scene is fairly ordinary. The girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing, however. It starts really well, with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper, but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action. The only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette, with two girls and one guy hooking up. Stay away from this one."
4,Great for Kindle,"I was looking for an NIV version Bible for the Kindle as a read-thru-in-a-year. When I saw the this version, set up with start/stop daily readings timed for 90 days, I wanted to give it a try. The daily reading has been a little more reading than I've been able to handle, but still enjoy reading as I am able. Good to be able to move thru the chapters, but, being new to a kindle, I am still moving a little slowly. I like the NIV version and being able to access it on my kindle."
5,So EASY!,"Having the 90 Days Thru the Bible on my Kindle was so much easier than rummaging through the book. As a side bonus, I got a I Pod2 as a gift and the Amazon Kindle application allows me to have a copy on both machines.... so no matter where I am I can keep reading!Awesome!!Great Bible App and made even better on Kindle!!!!"
5,BIBLE IN 90 DAYS,THIS 90 BIBLE IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. THE SHIPPER WAS GREAT IN SHIPPING TIME AND REVIEW OF THIS ITEM
4,Read the Bible in 90 days,This NIV Bible is a tool to use to read the whole Bible in 90 days.. It has helped me stay on track. Totally unnecessary but helpful. I am glad I bought it/
2,Save your money!,"While this certainly is a nice Bible, it doesn't live up to the hype. Contrary to its advertisement, the print is very small and has very few features, with no concordance. (I bought a large print NIV Bible at Wal-Mart for the same price and it's wonderful -- and the print is larger.) Save your money!"
2,Not worth the money,"There really is no point to this Bible. It's a standard NIV Bible with nothing special about it, other than it containing a reading plan. The idea is to read through the Bible in 90 days, and I assumed that something about the Bible was special to help facilitate that goal. I was wrong. The only thing that made this Bible different than any of the other NIV copies on my shelf, was that the beginning and end of each day's reading was marked at the top of the page.Do yourself a favor and save the $13. Get any NIV Bible you already own and divide the number of pages by 90. Then just read that many pages a day. It's the same exact thing as this product."
1,"Entourage, Season 3, Part 2","I really wish I could offer a review of this product but since I have yet to receive it, eventhough you took payment for it exactly one month ago today, I am not able to offer an opinion.The payment was deducted promptly, the tracking number came prompty, ....and the tracking number goes no where, I only received a response to the first email I sent, after 16 days had gone by, telling me to wait 7 more. I thought, surely someone just made an error getting it out and they are sending it now....WRONG!!!! No one will respond to any other emails I have sent demanding my product or my money refunded. Quite frankly, I am suprised I am being sent an opportunity to submit a review since at this point I am not only being ignored as a consumer, I also have been stolen from as the money was processed and I have NEVER REVECIVED THE PRODUCT!!!!Someone should really check into your customer service skills!Still waiting in Nevada and not likely to use again!"
2,great show,"I stopped buying these part versions and started paying for a internet download site to download the whole version when it is released, its legit and I pay for it but not nearly as much as i pay for all these ""parts"" that add up."
3,Love the show not the split in seasons!,"Love the show! Speaking as a guy, this is great for any guy between 18-35! Awesome show, I ranked it a 3 cause in an effort to squeze every penny out of its consumers they split a season into two, so we need to pay for both parts. PERFECT!"
4,"I hate ""Part 2's""!","First off, I'm just bitter about the part 2 hiatus. I don't know why it took so long for season 3, part 2 to come out but it was worth the wait. Entourage hits it off with Ari returning to the good guys after some Ari-antics. Definitaly worth the wait (although they were testing my patience) and I'm already waiting for season four to come out."
5,entourage is well worth the money!,"entourage is truly a awesome show, if you are a sex and the city fan you will love this show! The characters are so realistic and Jeremy Piven brings something to this show,it would not be the same without him. I think it is well worth the money. Once you start watching you will crave more!"
1,HBO jerking us ... again!,"Why does HBO consistently decide to jerk their fans? Almost $80 for a ""complete"" season of this show! And the same amount for ""THE SOPRANOS"", ""ROME"", and ""DEADWOOD"". Sure they're great shows, but come on ... Showtime sells WEEDS and DEXTER in the $20-$30 range and NBC gives us an entire 24-episode season of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS for just $19.95!"
4,Great TV Show,Excellent Season. My only complaint is the division. Should release as one big set. Still a great show though.
5,I love this series!,"I didn't start watching Entourage until the 3rd season on HBO, but I have gone back to purchase all the seasons on DVD and have thoroughly enjoyed them! There is drama, action, suspense and a lot of laughs. I think the show has a wide audience appeal. My wife has enjoyed watching them and is looking forward to the 4th season being released so that she can watch the shows in order."
4,A readable academic analysis,"While perhaps a little heavy going for people who aren't either immersed in Australian politics or familiar with party politics in a Westminster system, ""The Machine"" nonetheless strikes an excellent balance between academic analysis and readability.Of course the level of ""user friendliness"" varies depending on author (the book is a collection of essays), none are so detailed as to be impenetrable. And each chapter offers useful insights into some aspect of the ALP.I found the chapters on each state party to be particularly useful, and in some cases found myself wanting even more detail. This is perhaps where I'd fault some of the essays - bibliography can be thin, and a ""Further Reading"" list would have been even more useful.Overall, though, an excellent analysis, not too difficult for the casual reader and with enough detail to satisfy all but the most demanding researcher."
4,the beginnings of p funk,"Early Parliment effort that sounds more like what the group would evolve into, Funkadelic. Very psychodelic. Very funky. Very wierd. All types of sounds here. Free your mind...."
5,Good lessons and examples,I'm still captivated by the skill and virtuosity of these two players. Don't misunderstand me. Neither of these men are gods with Victor's often clickly/clacky string noise (inherant in the double thumb style) and Steve's intonation issues they aren't perfect. But how close to perfect they do come! Awesome arrangements and examples of their techniques. I've watched it at least 75 times hoping that 1% would rub off on me.
5,Wooten + Bailey = SMOKIN!,"This was a pleasant surprise for me a few years back when this came out. I had always been a fan of Victor Wooten, and I love Fretless bass, so when I got this introduction to Steve Bailey, I was blown AWAY! Anyone who does not think that you can make music with one drummer and two bass players, you are sorely mistaken. The songs are all catchy and groove hard with great improvisation displayed throughout the work. In addition to the awesome DVD, there are moments in between the tracks where Victor and Steve explain their approach and techniques in doing these tracks. This was done at a time when the two had just started working together, and now after this many years, I would love to see a Bass Extremes, The Return. It is long overdue!"
5,A Must Have,"I had the experience of seeing Victor Wooten live recently (with the Flecktones) This video is the next best thing and maybe even better in some ways. Victor and Steve Bailey together are a combination that guarantees excitement. They do things with an electric bass that will astound you. If you are a bassist, just buy it - you won't be disappointed. Non-bassists will enjoy it too. Skip a meal if you have to. Get this video."
3,"Good CD But, the track list not match","I bought this item because i love the song, SAIL AWAY, and i want have it in live versión, but when i get the cd, it doesnt match the track list show here, have other, be sure the seller give you wath he offers."
5,Armani watch purchase,"The watch was beautiful....received in a timely manner. However, it was a gift and the this was not what they wanted."
1,This is one of the worst pianists of all time,"Sokolov is a heavy handed pianist with no sense of musicianship. I saw a review of his Berlin recital in the NY Times and bought several of his recording based upon that and the amazon reviews. His interpretations are that of a student, not a developed artist. I can understand why one of the amazon reviewers said she did not like Brahms but liked Sokolov. Sokolov, obviously, does not like Brahms either. Banging on the piano is not playing. If you want to hear Brahms played properly, listen to Helene Grimaud. Do not buy the Bach recording either."
5,Virtually unique as a completely wordless picturebook,"Dennis Rockhill's Polar Slumber/Seuno polar is virtually unique as a completely wordless picturebook that tells the wonderfully entertaining story of a sleepy little girl, a backyard snow bear, and a dreaming fantasy of a journey together through frozen landscapes and exotic creatures. All of which fade away with the coming of morning. The artwork is of museum quality and the imaginative and magical story is utterly charming. Polar Slumber/Seuno polar is very highly recommended, especially for children preschool through first grade!"
2,Michael crabs on and on and on...,"There are plenty other reviews written on this book already that pretty much say what I'd like to say. This author has a unique style of writing that I do not enjoy. He is bitter about his life, gay life, and American life. As in his other books, there are some fun one-line zingers, but mostly he just crabs on and on. Maybe as a stand-up comedian he is funny. As a writer, I found him intolerable. My partner, on the other hand, roars with laughter as he reads his books. To each his own."
2,YAWN!!!,"This book was utterly dull. Maybe my outlook on life is a bit different than Mikey's...but PLEASE. This is some tired reading material. Maybe I'm too young to relate to some of his anecdotes, to be honest I'm not sure, but I am sure that this book was no winner.His stories are dated, stereotypical, and above all BORING. Don't waste your money!"
3,Blah...,"There are a couple of good laughs in this book, the title story is funny, but overall the book is just average. Ford delivers a few chuckles, but mostly I was bored and wondering what all the fuss was about."
5,Mr. Ford has another winner!,"This book hits home just as well as ""Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me"" and ""That's Mr. Faggot to You"". I just cracked up when I read his Condensed History of Gay Pride as well as The Condensed Guide to First Dates. If you liked the first two books, you can't miss with this one."
4,Michael Thomas Ford is hysterical...,"Many people don't like his sharp, cynical humor. However, living in NYC, I can totally appreciate it. His short stories are things a gay-sitcom could be made out of, but only he's even funnier.An easy, quick read of short stories (perfect for mass-transit), and A GREAT GIFT idea for your ""queer"" friends."
1,Kaplan High School Biology,This was a poorly written book and losing the reader was quite easy with introduction of genetics. The information was too limited-
4,Easy Install!,I read some reviews that complained about the installation procedures of this unit. The only complaint I have was that the instruction didn't clearly describe or show you how to install the float switch correctly. I went online to Wayne's webpage and watched their video and it too doesn't explain the switch installation but I could freeze the picture and see it and that's all I needed.That's the only reason why they aren't getting five stars. Other than that the installation was easy. Heck I had a harder time figuring out the piping than getting the unit up and running. I elected to go with a marine battery and it's working fine too. The operation test after installation prooved to me that this pump will keep up as it pumps as much or more than the original unit the builder had installed (1/4 HP unit). Combined with my new half horsepower pump I don't think I will have any problems with flooding. I just need to test it often and remember to do battery maintenance.
4,Mr.,"The product was delivered quickly. I was surprised that it only took a few days to arrive. My sump pit is small, but, was able to fit the backup pump next to the main pump. Installation was quick, only about an hour and a half. If you've been researching you know that the battery is not included. A heavy duty Marine battery will add at least $150 to the final price. We have not had alot of rain recently, so I have not been able to fully test the system out. Other than filling the pit up a couple of times with the hose and emptying it with the backup pump all I can say is that it works. Good Luck!"
1,Lousy product,"I installed the Wayne ESP15 battery backup sump pump 6 years ago. I was on my 3rd battery about 2 years ago, had it stop working several times over the first 4 years and about a year ago the circuit board fried. Keep your money. Spend more if you have to. You'll regret buying this brand."
3,Wayne ESP 15 Back up sump pump,"works as advertised. only tested, not needed yet. don't trust charger. never hooked it up. i keep an eye on battery and will charge when needed with my smart charger. i think the cheap charger included may overcharge. good value if it keeps working."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,System does not include a battery...granted I was in a rush to get this before hurricane Irene attacked but it was not clearly stated. The battery ended up costing me an additional $100.00 and I literally got the last one and got lucky. The unit itself did the trick thankfully.
4,pumps fast,my regular pump stopped and this was more than adiquite to handle the jod of the main pump.I would recomend this back-up to any one
3,Wayne ESP25 back-up sump pump,The Wayne ESP25 back-up sump pump seems to be of high quality and was fairly easy to install. We had some questions regarding the installation and the customer service department at Wayne pumps was very helpful and answered all my questions. Good product so far.
5,Wayne Back-up Sump Pump,The Wayne Back-up Sump Pump was reasonably priced and easy to install. Installation took less than 30 minutes once pipes were cut to size. The directions were clear and easy to follow.
1,Lasted just over a year,"Bought one of these and it installed easy enough. The charging unit lasted one year and two months, just in time to fail for the spring thaws and rains. Tried email correspondence per their website to purchase just that piece and was told to call the 1-800 number that there was testing I needed to do. Sat on hold for 45 minutes, at my work, on manufacturer customer service line and call was not answered. The line is not available after 6PM EST so calling from home is not an option. Tried email again to purchase the charging unit and again referred to customer service line.Yanked it out and replaced it with one from another manufacturer. I need peace of mind to know my finised basement will not be ruined."
2,Defective,Product was defective - you don't find this out until you have it totally installed and the pump only pumps for 10secs. Contacted manufacturer and was told having problem with the float switches so sent me a new one. Of course new one didn't fix the problem so I was told it is the controller box that is attached to the battery case. Was told to contact Amazon.com to get a replacement controller. Amazon's way of fixing it is to send a hole new pump set out and remove everything that I got installed and replace with new pump. Package all the old/bad items up and return. It sounds simple but with all the rain we have been getting around here it is very hard to remove and install a new pump when the water is filling up faster then you can do all of the work. The control box can be simply changed out without removing everything. Working with manufacturer to try to get new controller. if it doesn't fix the problem I would not recommend this pump as it only pumps for 10secs and then shuts off.
3,Additional Costs,"Haven't had to use it, but worked fine during my test. Installation took me about 2 hours but that doesn't include time getting the additional parts. You'll need PVC cleaner and cement. You'll also need a one-way check valve. Float switch was defective. Called Wayne, nice enough. Sent me replacement, but little disappointed when they said they had been having problems with that switch. Also, battery not being included was not a surprise, but make sure you're ready for cost of the battery. Not cheap. After my neighbors basement flooded and cost nearly $1,000 to repair / dry out, I figure $350 (pump, batter, cement/cleaner) is cheap insurance. Assuming it works when I need it."
5,So far so good,Setup and installation was straightforward and pretty easy. Float test on emergency battery test confirmed the pump to be in working order. This may sound weird but now I hope I never have a chance to use it.
5,Easy install,"Installation was not complicated, easy to understand pictorial instructions.We saved money on the battery by purchasing a deep cycle marine battery from Wal Mart."
4,so far so good,Did not have too use it yet but it was easy to install and the product looks like it will run nice.
4,Good stuff..,"I'm not a huge fan of the lemon smell, which is why I gave it 4 stars.. but it works pretty well on dry skin. My shins/ lower legs do not absorb moisture from most lotions and are easily irritated by perfumed products, but this lotion seems to penetrate further for lasting softness with no irritation."
2,"I Just Don't ""See"" It","Is it me, or does Crystal Lewis sound more whiny ever than before. I was a true Crystal Lewis fan when I heard her song ""Beauty of the Cross."" I fell in love with her then soulful voice. Beauty for Ashes and Gold are both great albums. Fearless, in my opinion, was not as good, but she still had some good songs like ""Reach Out,"" ""Only Fools,"" and ""One Man,"" and ""Change My Heart.""But See is seriously marred by poor lyrics, poor production, and poor vocals. What I once regarded as soulful singing has now degenerated into a whining mess of a voice. What happened to the Crystal I once knew and loved? I mean, it sounded like she was trying to save $ or something. For goodness sakes, stop writing your own songs! Hire some good writers, get some good live musicians to replace the horrible synthesizers/drum machines, and hire some strong back-up singers for fuller, richer vocals. ""My Emmanuel"" is a very good song. I'll give her that. But See just really isn't her best."
5,"""See""","This album released by Crystal Lewis is a great album for those who are Christians and those who are in the process of becoming a Christian. Crystals' voice is outstanding-she proves it time and time again with each song. Crystal herself will say that her talent does not come from her but is a blessing from God. I have been a fan of her music for a while now and will continue to listen to her music. Her most recent release, ""See"" has made me in fact See better as a Christian."
5,Her strongest CD since Beauty For Ashes,"This is a fantastic CD from start to finish and Crystal is sounding her best on this latest release ""See"". By far her strongest release since ""Beauty For Ashes"", ""See"" is a fine mix of up-tempo & mid-tempo songs, and some powerful ballads all of which are very inspiring and encourage us in our walk with Christ. Standout tracks include: ""So Happy"", ""Think about it"", ""Image of God"", ""Learn To Fly"", ""Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow"", and my personal favorite which I hope is released as a single - ""Never Alone"". There is not one song on this CD that I do not like; this is the first CD in a long long time that remains on auto-replay in my discman. Highly recommended CD! A+"
2,Mediocre,"""Just Sing"" is the best song. The other songs are all slow and uneventful- very helpful if you're having trouble getting to sleep. I'm a big fan of Crystal, but I was disappointed in this after waiting so long for it.The biggest problem with the whole cd, including the song I like, is that she doesn't use those powerful vocals I love so much. Too much of this whispery stuff like she did on the Holy, Holy, Holy cd. If you want to hear her let loose and blow you away with her powerful vocals, you ain't gonna get that at all with this cd."
2,It's an atlas--it needs more maps,"This is a great book for pictures and descriptions. However, there are not too many maps. The other books in this series are fantastic, and they have lots of enlightening maps. This book stands out for not living up to the quality of the rest of the series. 30 maps in 191 pages! There is a 34 page stretch with no maps--42 if you don't count the one 3""x4"" map that appears within that stretch! Many maps are just squares on the page with little info. There were only 3 or 4 maps that add visuals that are not in The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings. The Penguin atlas is far superior."
4,Great starter book,"Overall I think this book gave me a great start in PHP. Other reviews seem to think the same.For me however it had real examples that I could put to use right away. It is concise and easy to follow.I am not generally a fan of the Dummies' book format but it works,The most glaring problem with this book is that many of the examples in the book, particularly the membership example has an unbelievable amount of typos and capitalization errors that have to be debuged before the script could possible work at all. Makes you feel kind of ripped off.I still recommend it to anyone who wants to get up and running fast. This book won't bury you in detail your not ready for."
2,banging my boody head against the screen in frustration,"i'll keep this review tio the point. when learning something, I like to have straightforward tutorials that guide me step-by-step through the process of creating something. i dislike having to read through mountains of theory before even getting to a halfway decent practical. it's ok as a reference, but i felt that it didn't really give me a good enough start to utilse it as such.i'm back to square one - looking through web page tutorials. that will teach me not to read other customer reviews!"
3,Good book for beginners at first,"I wanted to learn PHP and MySQL but I was a complete novice before buying this book. This books was a great investment in gaining knowledge for both php, mysql and putting the two technologies together. My only complaint is that by the end of the book the author seemed to have gotten really lazy. The examples wont work at shown especially chapter 12: Building a Members Only Web Site""All in all, this book is a good reference for novices. Once you're out of the novice stage, do expect to buy another book; one that is more indepth. Good luck."
1,"Never ordered it, never got it. I have no idea why I am being asked to review it.","Never ordered it, never got it. I have no idea why I am being asked to review it. Adding more to be able to submit this review."
1,Typo and missing modules,"When you buy a software manual, especially a beginners for ""Dummies"" book, with a CD that has source code with all sorts of typo errors, and an Apache windows host installation that has a missing critical php_so mod, so that you can't use the Apache installation, you're behind the eight ball from the very beginning.So, count on all sorts of frustrations just trying to get an installation working. Did these people ever hear of quality control or are they just trying to piss off someone trying to learn this stuff to no end. Because I opened the CD, I can't return this piece of crap. It now occupies spacer duty along with some old yellow pages under a monitor.It's not even useful as a toilet paper source."
4,Very Good!,"This book was perfect for me. It had exactly the amount of information that I needed to complete my project. The book provided all the details I needed and had warnings of things to watch out for. It was organized well,entertaining, and easy to understand. The examples were short and focussed so that they clearly illustrated the point of the example and were very easy to understand. This is exactly the right book for someone who knows someHTML, but doesn't know any programming, and wants to develop a web site that requires the use of a database."
1,Spelling errors kill programming languages,"Had I no prior experience, I would not have been able to troubleshoot all the errors in the book and scripts. I have used as much time reading the PHP manual to fix the errors as I have reading this book. Incorrect spelling caused stop errors. This book is NOT for the beginner. You have to be able to troubleshoot the problems by using prior experience and knowledge. I have been at it several days and have not quite fixed all the errors yet. I recommend saving your money by NOT purchasing this unsupported, incorrect text."
2,Book needs more examples,"I order the book and was disappoint that the book didn't have more examples. The books expains the basic's of MySql\PHP , but more like read 100 pages and Oh type this . There are better books out there."
1,A Tirah Commentary for Our Tines: Numbers and Dueteronomy,"I ordered the above book, but the seller sent me the Genesis book instead, abd I don't know how to find out who I bought this from."
4,Keep this in the bathroom,"This is one of those books which is especially good for those unmentionable moments when you can do little more than stare at the bathroom door. Ash and Lake present their amazing collection of odd (and often unintendedly perverse) book titles like ""Suggestive Thoughts for Busy Workers"", ""The Potatoes of Bolivia"", ""Who's Who in Barbed Wire"", ""Play with your own marbles"", ""Making it in leather"", and ""Scouts in Bondage""."
2,Scruton the Apologist,"Roger Scruton is a polemical kind of philosopher, in many ways similar in style to John Searle. When Scruton does philosophy, it's a joy to read.But as others have complained, the philosophy in this book is a frame for Scruton to do Christian apologetics. If that's what one wants, it's not a bad book. Personally, Scruton's Christianity doesn't have much appeal for me. And the philosophical issues can get sidelined.If you're really interested in philosophy, Scruton's ""Modern Philosophy"" is a better place to look. No Christian apologetics, just philosophy. It's both an introduction and survey with Scruton's usual acerbic comments. Personally, the work is directed more toward intermediate philosophy readers than naive ones. But as a general introduction and survey, Scruton does himself very well.For a basic and broader introduction to philosophy, Robert Solomon's ""Introducing Philosophy"" with original texts and commentary is certainly to be preferred, but the price is outrageous."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as it could be","At the start of chapter 7, Scruton states that, ""Anglo-American philosophers write, on the whole, only for each other, in journals that few people troubled by life's brevity are tempted to read."" This is so true, and for a very long time, I have been searching for a book, or books, about philosophy that I could understand. This book comes SOOOOO close, but it was a good read anyway. mbossert@bigfoot.com"
3,"""Guide""","I wouldn't say that this is a guide. In fact it's mostly apologetics masked as a guide. It is in fact a good read. I liked the themes but all in all I wouldn't recommend this to any ""intelligent person""."
2,Good enough for some.,"Other reviewers have done admirable jobs of reviewing this book. I offer only a few random quotes from it. (1) ""I refer here and there to the great philosophers, and in particular to Kant and Wittgenstein, who have been the most important influences on my thinking."" (2) ""The judgement is not fair: none of Nietzsche's are."" (3) ""All discourse and dialogue depend upon the concept of truth."""
1,Utterly forgettable,"Rather than try and be objective and original, Mr Scruton delivers a tired and re-hashed right wing view of this schoolboy attempt to give an intelligent [sic] guide to his rantings. Not an original idea between covers, a great cure for insomnia.Had there been an option for less than 1 star I would have chosen it."
4,Love at first sight.,"This song isn't one of the strongest songs from the Fever album.I would have liked to see Burning up released instead of this song.The best reason to buy this cd single is for the ""Can't get blue monday out of my head"" mix. It is fantastic."
4,Love at first listening,"Though LAFS isn't the best track from Fever, it's still very good song. Can't get blue Monday.. is great, but I prefer the original version. But the reason for buying this single is Baby. A great track which should've been released on the album and as a single itself! Lyrics and melody are perfect, and like CGYOOMH's ""la la la"", Baby's ""dah dah dah"" is soooo catchy. LAFS's video is quite good, but 'cause my computer's quite slow, I haven't got so good experience from it. But you MUST buy this, because of Baby."
5,sensitive skin winner,"This is the only thing that I can wash my face with that is non drying, non irritating and leaves my face soft."
3,Good for your skin...,"Sebamed is less drying than regular bar soap and that really helps during the dry, winter months. However, the smell is a bit medicine-y so don't expect the scent of flowers and candy on your skin."
2,A little Fancy for a weeknight dinner,"This cookbook requires much more effort that the title implies and ingredients are likely to not be something you have in a staple cupboard. I like a little excitement when cooking, but this was a bit much."
4,this book,"At times this book can be confusing, often the author will make something unclear by leaving out a simple sentence or two. I can't really compare it to other texts- although i've looked through many this is the first I tried to actually learn from, but as far as a textbook goes it's not the greatest. In many places once you figure what he's trying to say, you also realize that an added sentence or step or justification would've made it far easier to understand."
4,Helps organize the hot wheels mess!,"We liked this display case a lot! My son loved it and is very happy to have all the cars displayed so he can get the one he wants to play with without having to sort them out of the bin he used to keep them before. And I sure am happy that this makes the cars neatly organized and out of the floor!It has been great for us so far, no problems at all!"
3,Tricky to use and doesn't last,"It looked nice for awhile.. but the top corners folded in from the weight of the cars so it was floppy, not flat.the brackets also didn't fit our doors, but I used clear packing tape to tape them flat against the door and that fixed that problem.It lasted about 2 months before it ripped."
3,3 Stars 'cause it doesn't stay on,"This is such a great concept, I wish it stayed on the door. We are working to try to come up with a ""fix"" because it beats stepping on 100 cars on the floor!"
5,I want one on every door!!!,I really love this item. And I really really want one on as many doors as possible. We have about a thousand Hot Wheels and this keeps them organized and keeps them in great condition. This is also a fun decoration for your house! I love it!!!(mom of 4 and .25)
2,Can't shut our Door while using this!,This is a great concept however I can't shut the door it is hanging on because the depth of the metal bracket is too deep for our doors. We have generic six paneled doors. Unfortunately had to take it back. My son was very disappointed!
2,Short lived storage solution,"I am a mother of 3 boys. My oldest two, ages 2 and 4, have an extensive hot wheels collection. I bought this item to provide them with an attractive, easily accessible storage option for their hot wheels. However, I was very disappointed with the durability and functionality of this product. It will only hold hot wheels cars. It does not hold trucks, vans or any of the more creative hot wheels designs. Most importantly the cloth straps which support it are stitched into the plastic seams on the face of the storage unit. This allows the front to tear easily away from the straps. The item only lasted a month in my home before the stitching was torn from the plastic seams, rendering it useless. It is disappointing that the name of such a durable toy was placed on such a flimsy storage solution. I would only recommend this product for use with much older children."
2,Doesn't work on our doors,"We're extremely disappointed that this item doesn't work with any door in our house (just standard doors, nothing weird about them!) We've tried adjusting it in every way possible, but the metal over-the-door parts still pop forward every time you open the door, making it so you can't shut the door the next time without readjusting it--which is very annoying. It's very durable and the slots are great, so I'm trying to find another way to hang it in our son's closet without using the over-the-door feature."
4,All in all a good concept could improve alittle,This product worked for me i think its a great idea i have an 8 yr old .Clearly NOT for younger aged children ( 2 or 4 yr olds ) recommended age is 6 to 10.probably because they can rip the vinyl storage compartments .my son is not neccesarily gentle but he not overly rough when taking cars in and out to play with which is alot.He likes cleaning up his cars now with his cool organiser and can see clearly what cars he wants to take out instead of digging thru a box and dumping all out .Bad part is no space for bigger cars but easily solved by putting in seperate bin for bigger cars.Vinyl shoild be reinforced somehow .i havent had problem with vinyl tearing but i have heard a few other people have.All in All good product with room for a little improvement.
4,Nice & Tidy,"I read the reviews from other buyers before I ordered, so I was a little skeptical, but I really thought this would be a great way formy grandson to take care of his cars. He thinks it's really cool butI'm having a frame built for it to keep the strain off the straps andhopefully that will make it last longer."
2,A little flimsy,"Organizer is a little flimsy to hold so many hot wheels, but it gets the job done. I recommend putting it on a closet door or a door that isn't opened and shut many times a day."
5,Simply the best,"Fast Eddie is a great entertainer and player. Guitar , Banjo , Singer... A great person too..... Early 1900 stuff that just sounds awesome... a great CD"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"It wasn't what I was expecting.Maybe my grandmother would enjoy this production, but for a mom-on-the-go, it wasn't up my alley.Needs to more updated with other products available on the market."
1,Nathan Wallace's Delphi 3 Example Book,"A total waste of money. Includes a CD which only has hyperlinks to a non-existent web site, the contents of the CD is contrary to what is described on the back cover. Email's sent to the publishers regarding the CD were ignored.Do not include this book in your library. The Delphi Online Help is of better value."
2,Totally Incomplete,"I purchased this book from Amazon in good faith assuming that it would contain data which is sorely missing from the Delphi supplied material. To my surprise, the data I need was not put in print. Instead, chapters 14 thru 20 are placed on the accompanying CD. OK I guess, but not convenient as a good reference tool. When I looked on the CD to find the data I needed, I discovered the CD does not work. I then went to the support web site, only to find that it hasn't been updated since the first week of February, and has absolutely no usable data except an admission that the CD does not work. I feel cheated, even to the point of fraud. I intend to pursue a refund from the publisher. Amazon doesn't need to tarnish their name with this kind of missrepresented work either."
2,Poor sound quality,I purchased this recorder because it played both standard and Library of Congress Tapes. I was very disappointed with the poor sound quality for both standard and Library of Congress tapes and I returned it. I also had difficulty with finding out how to change the recording mode from standard to Library of Congress Tapes. Neither the printed instructions from Maxi-Aid or the cassette tape included with the player explained that the control on the upper right hand side should be turned to play LC Tapes. I would not have expected this difficulty since the player is sold by Maxi-Aid. Also the return process is more complicated because you have to call and get a return authorization. The staff at Maxi-Aid were gracious but I had to dial a second number for the authorization because I purchased the recorder from Amazon.
4,A Good Addition to any Typographer's Library,"Although I have no intention (nor talent) of becoming a calligrapher or hand-letterer this book is of tremendous value to people who are interested in the history of how the the many writing styles have evolved into printed type. This book has many examples which describe the techniques of hand-lettering with pen and ink and their evolution into the letterforms for typecasting and printing. My major interest in this book is that I believe that a thorough understanding of the origins of the written letterform is of great interest and value to the typographer and type designer. The section of the book which details the proportions of the Roman majuscules and minuscules is worth the price of the book.P.S. I am grateful that Dover Publications, Inc.New York is keeping so many books of on these valuable historical subjects in print."
5,Watch Eric Clapton watch Buddy Whittington i awe,"All I can say, is Buddy Whittington's playing in this program is nothing short of amazing. His tone .... his style ....Even Eric Clapton at many points in the show just has to stop and stare at Buddy Whittington's tone and playing.Just goes to show you what a great player, playing with great folks, through a great amp (Dr. Z MAZ SR and Z-best 2x12 cabinet) can do.A must for any blues fan, John Mayall fan, or guitar player wanting to hear things done RIGHT on the money."
5,"CLAPTON, TAYLOR & WHITTINGTON","I think this is one of the best DVD'S of 2003. This is some of the finest guitar blues I have seen in a long time. The recording quality is excellent (DTS). Mayall is in top form very strong vocals, and classic Mayall harp. It's great to see Mick Taylor, he's still awesome. Clapton like always is excellent also. Buddy Wittington blew me away he's fantastic. He is right up there with Eric & Mick, I love the enter play between these three guitarist. Mick's slide playing is some of the best I have seen in awhile, all in all the soloing of these guys is something you just have to see."
4,Why isn't the whole concert here?,Why isn't the entire show here on this DVD? The DVD can hold up too 4 hours of content...............The CD is awesome................
5,He'll Keep Rockin' Until He's In The Coffin!,"I saw John six years ago on a hot Mesa Arizona afternoon. He looked old and tired from the heat and the road (I talked to him and he signed my ticket and a CD I bought). Here on this show he is clearly having a ball as was the audience and band. Another reviewer said his voice is shot. He/she had better get a new sound system! What I heard and saw was an excellent show from the undisputed grandfather of the British blues and a fantastic band giving a GREAT performance. The band (including Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones) all seemed very proud and happy to be a part of this monumental occassion.If you enjoy the blues, this DVD is a MUST for your collection!"
3,Where are all the songs?,"This DVD was released about two weeks later than the CD set of the same concert. I was disappointed to note that the DVD excluded three songs that were on the CDs (of course, wouldn't you know that these would have to be what I considered three of the best songs). With a total DVD running time of 137 minutes, there was obviously room on the DVD to include all the material. A true shame, since it is overall an excellent performance and has a DTS soundtrack."
4,A New Way to Look at Opera,"This graphic novel is a wonderful way to tell the stories of operas. Operas have complex plots, bigger than life characters and lots of action. P. Craig Russell captures all of these in his graphic novels."
4,"Great stories, great art","Opera is a grand tradition of musical story-telling. The repertoire includes many stories adapted from myth or mythic in themsleves.Opera is also, I'm afraid, an acquired taste, and one that I have not acquired. That's part of the reason I'm so happy to see these adaptations in a form I can appreciate. Another part of the reason is that I just like Russell's art, no matter what story it tells.Opera purists may object, but hey - it gets people like me interested in the stories, and that's a start. I have to admit, though, a little more background information would have made these extracts a bit easier to understand.Classic stories and good visual rendering, a good combination. Enjoy!//wiredweird"
4,A delightful view of the ramifications of string theory,"Although this book goes into a little too much advanced theory and mathematics for its intended audience, I applaud the authors for a very well-rounded and candid approach to string theory for the layperson. I have recommended this book to many non-physicist friends of mine, and they have all enjoyed it tremendously. However, I do not recommend this book for aspiring physicists as it (like most books of its type) tends to focus on parts of string theory that have yet to be completely explored; this makes the book highly speculative in my opinion. It's great for a fun read, but I wouldn't put too much confidence in its speculations: they could easily be disproved in the next few years."
3,"If you missed the show, read this","This book is the collection of interviews with famous individuals on this subject i.e String Theory. Narrative of the BBC show, all usual suspects are here and their responses on same or similar questions on the origins of the Spring Theory, status of the theoty and future of the theory. There is no mathematics, it is interview for general public. Although there are concepts or rather english words floating around and if you do not know what it is you do not understand the pohysics behind it but for layman this book gives a good insight into what is going on in new physics and who has what opinion. Suspects include geen, Feynman, Witten, Weinberg, Glashow, Salam and some more. Interesting reading."
3,Better than the 2000 album,"Don't be put off, this music is considerably better than ""Telstar"", as it is significantly more complex, and more interesting, than that early 60's instrumental. Nonetheless, this music is reminiscent of that sound. Of the two SSSU albums I have, I prefer this one to their earlier album (The Spacesound Effect), as that one gets a bit tedious. This one has a more current feel to it, even a bit 'trippy', even though it is from 2002. This isn't something you'll listen to often, but it is a nice change. If you're just going to download a song or two, try Harlem Nightdrive, Emerald Coast, or The Birdman."
1,Terrible sound quality.,"The sound quality on this CD is very poor- it sounds like a cassette copy. I also had the volume on my stereo turned all the way up, but it still wasn't loud enough."
2,This DVD lesson is a joke,"The guy in this DVD, John McCarthy, can't even do clean string sweeping in the DVD. I think this DVD is a joke. All he showed in the DVD is some basic metal riff and some simple sweeping at slow speed (the sweeping he did doesn't even sound clean lol). I bought this DVD because I got free gift certificate from amazon.com. I wouldn't recommand this to you because you can find better ""Advanced metal"" licks/[...] ......Bottom line, this dvd is not worth more than 10 bucks."
1,Where is the Love?,"Take a listen to the samples and you'll soon discover Fab-4 creations with no soul, no feeling, no phrasing, and no love. All you need is love and this album has none."
3,Better for Beginners,"Although the scholarship is excellent, I found this book too general for what I need. It was more of an overview of (mostly) Paul's writings. I was looking for in-depth discussions of specific texts, whereas Collins organized more by themes and whole epistles."
1,A GRAVE MISFIRE,"This hokey and disjointed thriller is reminiscent of the British horror films of the sixties, slow and methodical, but without the ultimate payoff. So much time is spent in setting up the relationship of its three protagonists that little suspense is generated and the script hops back and forth in time without any obvious breaks so its hard to keep up with just when this stuff is going on. Suffice to say, the story follows a young artist and her ex-husband and current boyfriend, who were all the best of friends when youths. Since the divorce, however, hubby Martin has become desperately possessive and even psychotic. The script tries to pull some twists, but they're so contrived and implausible that the final effect isn't a desired one I'm sure. The acting is mediocre except for a nice turn from Margaret Tyzack as the girl's nosy neighbor and confidante. Not spooky at all, folks!"
2,"Great concept, voices and story not strong enough to support","The thought of the progeny of a philandering man and his paramours reaching out to one another is an interesting concept but TOTALLY unbelievable. There's no way that two life long friends would have children by the same man and not know it.The ""voices"" of the different characters were not distinct and the childrens voices were just not credible. The only character I liked was Gene and there wasn't enough of him in the story.If I read any more works by this writer it will be as a borrowed book from the library.C.M. Miller, author---Taxes, Death, & Trouble"
3,Pages Readers Group Reads Kinfolks,"If nothing else, ""Kinfolks"" stirred up some emotion and conversation at the Pages Discussion meeting. Comments ranged from ""no they didn't"" to ""what in the world"" were Patrice and Cherry drinking! The story of these ""power-to-the-people"" sisters is a mix between funny, sometimes outrageous with a twist of complexity. Our group tried to identify with the sisters and the choices they made in keeping a ""pivotal"" secret from their children. One that nearly caused a genetic disaster. Not everyone enjoyed this tale of three single-moms, trying to raise ""almost perfect"" kids with making ""daddy"" take some parental responsibilities. However, the banter during our discussion let us know that Kristin Hunter Lattany did a creative job in developing the characters and story"
4,Something I Would Have Done,"This book was a joy to read, while I first thought the plot came a little too fast, as I continued to read, I realized I didn't know what the plot really was. The bond between the Patrice and Cherry reminded me of my older sister and her girlfriends. The women in the book handled the issue with grace and maturity, no kiddy, catfights. (As seen on the raunchy talk shows.)You go ladies! While this book is a work of fiction, it shadowed my own life. I have recently located my 'kinfolk' and the initial reactions were welcoming.As a child, I couldn't understand why my Dad would greet our friends with the question, ""Who are your folks?"" I just thought it was because he knew everybody, and he does.We later found out the reason, it was to make sure we were not kinfolks.I'm looking forward to reading other books by Kristin Hunter Lattany."
4,"I Laughed, I Howled! Hilarious","Readers who were teenagers or in their twenties during the sixties can definitely ""relate"". Two dsyfunctional friends/parents Cherry and Patrice find out their children who are about to marry have the same father and the story takes off. Cherry and Patrice begin looking for Eugene Green's other children of the sixties. They even recognize a son of his living in the neighborhood. Just how many women were charmed by Eugene Green during the ""free love"" and ""I don't need a husband"" era. In their search, their friendship is strengthen, they set real priorities, and there is personal growth and action for both of the friends. Meanwhile, the children having to fend for themselves not only ""grow up"" a little, but find and help their biological father. Well written. Delightful and funny. This book gives new meaning to our parents statement ""who are his people""?"
1,Not impressed,"I was not impressed by this book. It could have been better. The plot was revealed early on, and then the book went downhill.I was waiting for something huge to happen after the plot came out, but nothing was there.Please do not waste money on this book...get it from the library if you must."
2,Something New and Different,"This book is an easy read. It really flows with the subject. I would have never thought all of these different families could get together and be friendly and cordial to one another. Aisha and Saint when they found out they were brother and sister, they never discuss their relationship anymore. How could Cherry and Patrice best friends never discuss they slept with the same man. Seems to me the money they raised should have gone on their bills. It was good to see Cherry found a nice man. But I just dont see women getting together finding their lovers children."
4,Kinfolks,"Kinfolks is the story of two best friends who's son and daughter are about to get married, but shocking news will keep them from being together. This book was good, but also made us look at one of the bad parts of just going around having kids without being in a serious relationship."
3,cute but falls apart,"this is an adorable toy except for one thing, the base comes off super easy. Everytime my daughter picks it up the base falls off! If it weren't for this 1 problem with would be a perfect toy for Annabell."
3,the sleave to tide the drill was broken. inside!!,This is the second time that i get a defective itemfrom you in one month. The other item was the wheelbarrol that was missing two parts.
1,Waste of Money & Time.......You have been warned....!!!!!,"I bought the Orion padded case for my XT10 classic dob hoping that it would make the transport of optical tube convenient, but what a bummer from Orion. Clearly shows that they never even bothered to test this cover. First of all the case is too big for my XT 10 that my optical tube just moves inside freely...very scary. Also the handle straps are so awkwardly placed that you can neither carry on both of your hands nor sling it over your shoulders.Orion says that it is made to suite XT10's, but what a lie.Pls save your money and time...and frustration with this useless bag advertised with full of lies."
1,I bought 5 obus form products,"I bought 5 obus form lumbar support products, 3 of this model. 4 of the 5 products were defective!! Only one of these half back cushions held air and I really like it--- I like it so much that I wanted another. That is why I ordered more. The rest were all defective. 3 were defective because they wouldn't hold air; the other had a 8"" rip in the fabric!"
2,Cushion went flat after a few days of use,"While the cushion when correctly inflated provided good support, from the time I started using it, the cushion started leaking air and I had use the built in pump to inflate it. As time wore on, I had to re-inflate more and more often until it simply wouldn't hold are for more than a minute or so."
1,Insufficient Item for use,I brought Item Thinking that It would help me with my Toyota Seat. Unfortunately I found out that It was way too small for my Toyota SeatsThey are 25''x 20'' High & Wide. When I set on this Item in my Car It would Automatically Deflate itself Not good! So I returned it for a Refund.
4,I bought it anyway,Even though this product had many negative reviews on Amazon I bought it anyway because it was exactly what I was looking for (the only one I could find that fit my needs). When it arrived it had no strap to attach it to a chair or car seat (one of my criteria for purchase). I sent it back to Amazon (surprisingly easy and quick)and received a new one that is everything I had hoped for.
1,POS!!!,"Valve broke same day i got it. Buy something else. The rating system won't allow zero stars, so I had to put 1."
5,"Truth, first hand","An excellent behind the scenes look at Cuba today. No better example of a failed yet still forced socialist state. This is not some itellectual dissection of the situation but a ""person on the street"" documentary. Must read for those who take democracy and free enterprise for granted and for those who even think Cuba is better now than in pre-revolution time.As a Cuban born US citizen I applaude this book."
5,Comprehensive Southern Cookbook,"Bought my first copy of ""Tea Time at the Masters"" in 1986 and wore it out, so when I saw that I could replace it with a (slightly) used one at Powell's Books, courtesy of Amazon.com I was on it! ""Tea Time at the Masters"" is a wonderful cookbook for those that like easy to follow, authentic Southern dishes."
3,OK,"Collection is ok. My expectations were very high, but I would rate this cook book as average. Not sure how much I will use it."
5,Just as promised!,I love my cookbook. I was a little leary to order a used one but it was in mint condition! Thank you so much!!
2,"Weak Scent, Poor Lather","This soap appeared to be a good buy for a sandalwood soap. But, the fragrance is slight while bathing and does not last long afterword. This is a hard soap with very little lather and seemed to take a long time to wash. I have used several other sandalwood soaps and the scents vary considerably from brand to brand. This soap smells nice when held against your nose, but otherwise is unremarkable. I would not recommend this soap to anyone who enjoys sandalwood. However, it would make a respectable motel soap!"
5,Excellent alternative,"An excellent alternative to the more traditional methods of 'working"" the 12 steps. A wonderful way to learn in a spiritual manner."
4,Worth the wait of finding.,"After having played Soirees Musicales in symphony a few years ago, I had been searching for it on CD since. Finally, I found it on Amazon. I must say it is well worth the wait. The two collections (Soirees Musicales and Matinees Musicales) take me directly back into the performance hall. These pieces are excellent orchestral representatives."
3,Mixed feelings on this one,"Althought there are some good things on here, be aware that the CD-ROM is merely a demo of transitions and such (that have huge ads on them). I really kind of felt like the book was just so they could hook you on their special effects and sell those. Not a lot of new things in the book if you are an advanced user. Many of the neat effects they list can only be achieved by purchasing those programs.It has some good ideas for beginners or intermediates, but if you are more advanced, keep looking...and if you find a good book on PowerPoint that has some great advanced ideas, e-mail me!"
3,"Cut off the handles and use as a bed, by Chloe F.","If you were going to buy this I think you'd be better off cutting off the handles and using it as a bed. Your daughter (or son) could put this on their windowsill if it's big enough, or on top of their toy chest. I don't own this yet, but judging by the first review of this product it seems delicate enough where you should just use it delicately. You might have better luck with it, but I have yet to find out. I think I'll cut off the handles no matter what. I'd rather carry it on my back than hold it for hours. If you are going to use it as a bed you don't have to cut off the handles. Just make sure Baby Annabell has a blanket or she'll get cold."
2,Sugar free sweetener,"First I have eaten a lot of licorice in my day. These Red Vines S.F. black licorice vines were very tasty-little chewier than the regular but still good.That is why the 2 stars. I did e-mail Red Vines about that but did not get a reply. Was eating 4-5 pieces a day-I don't consider that a lot- & then something very strange started happening to my (to put it nicely) tummy. Narrowed it down to the licorice after some Internet research. Found out I was not alone that it was ""disagreeing"" with me. It does say on the package that it ""may have a slight laxative effect"" but that wasn't the entire problem. It contains the sugar sub. Maltitol.Side effects are major bloating,gas,more gas,bad gas,gurrgling & strange colored movements-if you get my drift.This may not be the norm-but I have consumed a lot of sugar free products and have never had the consequences that resulted after eating this product. Anybody want my remaining 10 bags?? Don't think I will be having any anytime soon."
1,WEAK!,I own many WWII flight sims. This is the weakest piece of crap of all I have ever purchased...
4,Best LucasArts Game Sience X-Wing Alliance,"I Diden't like this game all that much when i got it for Christmas, played it a little and that's it, but i got into it a year later and i loved it, that was after i got into World War II Stuff, i say buy this game no matter what people say, it's an all around fun game, plus with the upgrades for completing objectives, you can get medals if you do good enough in a mission, unlock alot of aircraft such as the ME-262 and the Supermarine Spitfire, it's a great game and very fun missions, point is buy this game, it's great for any day."
5,My first score!!!,"I've tried many combat flight sims and have found most of them overly complicated. I do not have time to 'build' skills to become a simulator ace. I just want to get in the a/c, go up against the enemy, fly interesting missions, blow the crap out of stuff, shoot down bad guys, and live to talk about it. The very first time I jumped into SWON, I shot down 4 enemy a/c; this is the first time I actually scored a kill. How satisfying!! 5 stars for this fun & interesting game."
4,I WANTED TO SEE IF GEORGE COULD DO STAR WARS IN,"I'VE BEEN TRACKING VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT HISTORY SINCE ABOUT 2010.I BECAME DISABLED IN 1992, SO SSI IS CHEAP DATE A.S.C.E."
1,Let Down!,"I hoped for a updated version of Janes WWII combat flight sim. Thinking this would be similar with better graphics, I spent 50 bucks on this and wanted to throw it away a 1/2 hour later. Its just a ages 6 and up game. What a waste of money, I'll give it to my Nephews."
3,Great Flying Shooter.....But Tough!,"If you're expecting SWON to be a combat flight simulator, then you will be disappointed. What it is, however, is a fun arcade shooter. It does actually follow history, and gives you a chance to fly a great number of aircraft from WWII. I had to get used to the arcade style, as I'm not a PS/2 gamer. However, this game was much more fun that IL-2 as I actually got to shoot down enemy planes!The missions get tougher as they go along, with a lot to accomplish before you can move to the next missions.The only things I did not like was that I could not save the game when I wanted to, and the provided checkpoints were few and far between. This meant replaying a lot of difficult scenerios from the start. A good gamer should be able to cope with this.It's certainly worth the money. The graphics are good, and the lead-computing red ""shooting spot"" really helps. I also liked the ability to slow down the action, which helps you get through the tough spots."
2,"excellent knife, but it broke when chopping garlic!","This is true to my title. I love the Cuisinart knifes, I bought this set as it was on a sale and loved it! But unfortunately, sharp as they come, they are not strong. I was chopping garlic one days and the knife just broke into half. Worse, I've sent the knife for a replacement and it's been over a month, I have yet to receive the replacement!!I am giving 2/5 because an unreliable knife and bad customer service doesn't make anything sharp worth it's money."
4,Good deal,I like this item good deal and I will order again. I like Pearl Drums good sound. The equipment is pretty solid
3,Not a normal snare wire,"These wires were way too long for my 14"" snare, and connected in a strange way. I returned them and got a different set."
4,Works,Used it in a Cajon Drum I built. Worked great and not much money. Just wish it was super saver shipping eligable. As for all things from Mucisian's Friend.
4,Connoisseur of SongBirds,"Outstanding vocals (her voice and presentation is uniquely great) and a quality orchestra. There is only one USA ""songbird"" of her genre, (rather was) Patsy Cline. The choice of material is quite good, but not as magnificent, as that of the other CD by Lolita, ""Weisser Holunder""; one, that should get Eight Stars on the 1-5 Star scale. Recommend buying that one too."
3,Not as good as the original CD,"Good old time German tunes. It's a good CD, just not quite up to the first and original one I bought."
4,LOLITA seemann deine heimat ist das meer and weisser holunder,"This recording is still very good in regards to sound quality, it was 1997 recroding.The plastic case was broken when I received, so be more careful to inspect beforeshipping.LOLITA WEISSER HOLUNDER IS VERY GOOD INDEED."
1,Nothing New Here,"This book tries to give the basics of the intelligence organization of the western countries, the USA, UK and France. It comes off as a very high level, average and uninspiring work. There is just nothing new here and I wondered if maybe this was not written for an age group of under 15. I was surprised because I had heard good things about his other work. This is a rather dull book and I would suggest looking elsewhere."
1,It melts deforms under the sun,"Do not by this product.Five days after I bought it, I went to my friend house and leaved it outside under the sun for about 2 hours (about 90 degree). It melted and deformed.It is a bad product from Adidas. I hope they improve this product soon"
1,hurt my son's feet,I bought these for my son but returned them because the pegs that make up the sole of the sandal hurt his feet. He won't wear them.
1,Irritate my feet,I tried them on for size in the store. When I got home and walked around they really irritated my feet. I returned them. My daughter has the Calissage so I'm getting those.
1,Spikes of Torment,"I hate these shoes. There are just painful. I thought the rubber nubs were soft, but they are very very hard. It's like walking on spikes. It is a little less painful wearing socks, but those spikes make these sandals useless."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!!!,These sandals are ridiculously uncomfortable. It feels like having a bunch of tiny knives stabbing at your feet with every step. These are the worst sandals I have ever purchased. Do yourself a favor and buy a different model.
1,If you have sensitive feet don't buy these.,I bought these thinking the little adissage would feel nice but after trying them the first time my feet were in pain after 30 minutes. Then I tried to wear them again another day but with thicker socks and found that I could only last 1 hour walking in them. What I would compare them to is walking bare foot on small pebbles if you can handle that and enjoy it then these are for you but if you have sensitive feet like I do you might want to buy the non-Adissage.
2,Too costly,"The first time I wore it, it seemed fun but the novelty wore off very soon. Also, this was too costly"
1,total crap,"adissage are total crap! i have been an exclusive adidas customer for many years and am completely pissed! the footbed of these sandals come apart with minimal, around the house wear in under 3 months, besides they are not that comfortable. adidas has no desire whatsoever to replace them or acknowledge the crap quality. i'm so pissed that i will never buy adidas products again. (...), ok, but i've spent thousands on adidas products over the years and deserve better treatment over a crap, cheap product. pass on these and buy some birkenstocks!"
4,Nice Shoes,I purchased these for my husband. He had a pair like them years ago and wanted another pair. He said the adissage pieces were hurting his feet more than massaging them so we scraped those off of the shoes and he wears them all of the time now.
2,"""Slides"" slide off...","These are some nice sandals. They look cool, can be worn with just about anything, and are very popular. They are also rather comfortable, once you get used to standing on hundreds of little bumps. However, I hardly ever wear them, because I have a very hard time keeping them from sliding sideways under my feet. I've tried tighteing them, loosening them, and altering the angle at which I velcro them, but nothing seems to help keep them from becoming crooked after just a few steps, especially if I'm walking at a brisk pace. I don't know how people wear these things around without having a problem with them sliding sideways. I would not recommend them, unless you can somehow keep them straight on your feet. If you can, they are great."
2,Not what it used to be....,"Don't buy these sandals...I purchased a pair of these five years ago and they were great. The nobs did not come off...the strap finally broke loose after three years of use. I just purchased a new pair in June and by August most of the nobs are off already. They are almost unusuable at this point.I wrote to the Adidas to let them know that the quality had gone downhill and got a 'corp-speak' response but no answer or even willingness to admit they have a bad shoe now. See update below:Recently, a friend of mine bought the Adidas Men's Calissage, with the clear nubs, and they have not lost any nubs in over three months. They seem to be about the same as this version, just better made nubs. I would recommend going with the Calissage...if you can find it in your size. I checked on Amazon and they were out of many sizes."
4,Not sure why I like these sandals so much,"The ""massage"" is actually hundreds of tiny plastic pegs digging into your feet. It actually hurts. But for some reason I love it..."
1,Great while they last - which isn't long,"As another reviewer reported, I had an older pair of these sandals that worked well for years, until the strap broke off. On the newer version, the nubs started breaking off immediately, quickly leading to large nubless patches under the forefoot and toes. They do provide great relief of muscle stress and soreness while they last. At first, the nubs become painful after about 20 minutes of wear - but they become more comfortable as the foot gets used to them."
1,I need to file a police report...,"Because I have been robbed and assaulted.First off, the quality is terrible. Like others, the nubs started popping off nearly from day one. I own a lot of adidas products and this is by far the worst I've ever purchased. Thanks for stealing my money.Second, my feet have never felt worse. The soles of my feet feel like they've been stabbed to death to the point that I had to ice my feet to feel better. I bought these in hopes of ""massaging"" my feet after running, as I was led to believe by the product name. Instead... OUCH.I'd like to note that I am an average size guy. No one (well, in America at least) would refer to me as fat or obese. My doctor whines at me to drop some weight, but I'm not heavy enough for these sandals to be falling apart and causing severe pain. I should have gone with the Callissage as I had those before, however I found the ""massage"" effect of those to be nonexistent."
5,coopers review,"I have ""The Simpson's Road Rage"" game and it rocks!! I like it because the picture's are great and also I really like the music. I have earned 16 car's out of 17 and plan to get that one soon. I am only on the second level but still having a lot of fun with it. By Cooper Groenhof"
4,just what i was looking for,"my daughter had asked for little mermaid bedroom set for her 3rd birthday and now it has been complete with everything, she seems to sleep all night with no problem. thank you."
1,13 Bucks for a 48 Page Book About One Goal,Plenty of better books out there about Bobby Orr and the Goal. And you'll get a lot more content in those than you will in this glorified essay/news story.
5,Old-Fashioned Halloween Cards : 24 Cards by Gabriella Oldham,Great Old fashion Prints of Halloween Cards gone BY!! Excellent color and Condition. Maybe a little to Glossy. But Still WOW!
3,Good for the Price,I use my motorcycle to work a busy field job in NYC. I've used these bags for 2 yrs now. They faded and totally ripped along one side so the bag was hanging away from the bike. I sewed it back along the length of the bag and am still use them daily.
5,Trotsky writes the truth.,"This is an excellent book for those who have heard the various lies put forth about Trotsky by Stalinists and their ilk. It corrects the history of the Russian Revolution, tossing out the fumbling falsifications brought by it's second leader, Joseph Stalin. Trotsky's commentary is quite informative and intelligent, and it gives insight into why the ""comrades"" of the Soviet Party against Trotsky behaved in the matter in which they did. Great book for those who want the truth; Stalinists won't like it."
5,EXCELLENT REFERENCE BOOK,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST,TOP 20 POP SONGS OF EACH MONTHS,ESSENTIAL FOR RADIO PROGRAMMING."
3,"Good, but some clear errors","This book provides a great resource for artists, recordings and rock and roll news for various years throughout the 4 decades 1950-1989. But there are a few errors with incorrect dates?? (although I guess this could be debated and some incorrect artist information). Overall its a good buy and if you are looking for a book with this information in it, this is probably the one.On a negative, pretty much all this information is available on sites such as wikipedia, rockalmanac.com, and can be found without searching too hard."
3,Rock On Almanac,"Received the book a little late for Christmas, but did receive it, with a few pages not in the best of shape, but only about 4 pages and the cover, which was mentioned before buying. Otherwise, the recipiant was happy with it."
5,Great for speaker cabinet building,"Since no one else covered this use, I figured I'd chime in. We just cut 24 7"" diameter holes in 3/4"" MDF with this cutter. Once we figured out how to use it, it cut a hole in under a minute, leaving a clean opening. Using it isn't for the faint of heart, but once mastered it works quite well. It takes strong arms and shoulders, because at least on MDF it works optimally with a good bit of cutting force and relatively low speed (about 4 - 8 revolutions/second for our size hole). Like all hole saws you need to be careful to keep it square to the work, but the cover works well as a guide, and doesn't allow you to get too far off square. The diameter markings on the cutter holder were very accurate. So far, this is the only hand tool I know of to cut accurate round holes larger than 6"" or so, where ordinary hole saws stop."
5,great,This is such a time saver.. I had to make about 20 holes or so threw out my house for home theater and music in my home. It takes about 1 minute to make a hole with this item. No problems at all it cute threw sheetrock like it was butter. I would reccomend buying a extra set of blades they dull quickly. They lasted the 20 whole and they were dull
4,Some what disappointed,"When I shopped for a ceiling hole cutter I wanted a quality USA made product. It seems the overseas clones are sorely lacking in qualitiy and are only ""close"" to the real thing. When I saw the Hole Pro I paid extra thinking it was a USA made product; nope, made in Taiwan with USA and Taiwan patents. The design appears as presented and superior to the other product offered on Amazon which is a third of the price of the Hole Pro. I try to support American jobs and products."
4,"Not for beginners, but good to see...","This DVD has some good technique, but it is definitely NOT for beginners. There is very little ""instruction"" in the video; some insight to the chords and scales played. The video is more of a ""one man sitting in a chair concert"" than anything else. Some of the ""songs"" played are WAY too long. However, if you want to see a guy that can REALLY play and do it effortlessly...Robben Ford is it. This video picks up on his previous video, so I would reccomend taking a look at that before buying this if you are a beginner."
2,Not Much Instructional Content,"This video is not much more than a Robben Ford jam session. He mentions some of the scales he is going to play but that is where the instruction pretty much ends. Robben is a great player and entertaining to watch, but if you want to learn to play like him, you will be disappointed."
1,Worst text book ever,"I can't believe I was forced to buy this book from my school for an Oral Communications class. The book has almost no bearing on communication in an office or business setting. It's overrun with ethics, empathy, and bull about feedback. Even the glossary dosent give straight deffinitions. Instead of a deffinition it gives examples. I HATED THIS BOOK. I can say without exageration that I will use this book for kindling in my fireplace."
3,"Essentials of Human Communication, Devito",This book was in poor shape (which I knew when I purchased it)due to highlighting and frayed book edges but everything was intact and readable.
2,It's not what is advertised,"The box is great, nicely made and beautiful though the pull out tray on top does not have a handle or adjustable slots. I was very upset by it. When I contacted the seller they just blew me off and said ""Well every one else has been happy with it"" And it's not that I don't like the box, it's that that is not what I ordered and not what is advertised. I recommend buying this box from another seller if you want what's in the picture."
1,POS,"This is the biggest piece of crap...period! After about two months had no sound from coaxial connection, had to use s-video and rca. Sound was still bad, but could hear it at high volumes. Soon after would no longer record from a timer program. Now I can't even get the f@#king disc out. Company is of no help and will not repair. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this garbage!!!"
1,Bitter Disappointment,"I purchased this unit almost two years ago and have yet to make it work. My brother, who is very tech savvy, helped me set up the unit. I had very little success working with tech support. My first call was answered and I was provided some assistance Since that call, I have been unsuccessful talking to anyone. They have an answering machine, but they don't return calls. I would stronly urge anyone considering the purchase of this product to reconsider. It was an expensive and frustrating mistake."
4,"Life, and everything else","Just as in real life we must stop to laugh at the small almost insignificant aspects, even if they come at the worst of times. This book, though not intended to be, is very funny because it points to the very nature of life that makes the hard times bearable.This is one of the first books by a contemporary author I am suggesting my friends read. A well written, well thought out novel with deep, complex characters with real flaws, tough feelings and emotions not seen enough. Lesley is truly a Pacific Northwest writer drawing from the beauty and landscape that makes many of our backyards escape into the beauty of an Oregon horizon. And whose characters are divinely independent while still needing people to survive. A novel worth reading."
5,a thorn on Cochise's side,"A precious historical contribution of Sweeney's. Merejildo was an interesting and fascinating figure during the war times between American soldiers and Cochise. He was a captive of Cochise's and he was the first ""apache scout"" who helped the USA army against the apache fox Cochise. He really was the fiercest enemy for the apache chief.One of the first optime works of the great scholar Sweeney."
5,Merejildo Grijalva,"I think this is just a wonderful book, not only because we have the same last name,but the name of Grijalva goes back into history, like Juan de Grijalva 1518 explorer, Juan Pablo Grijalva, with the 1775/76 Anza Expedtion. You have to read this book yourself to understand what Edwin R. Sweeney wrote in this book."
4,"""Conquistador""conquers its readers","Jeff Hunter combines style and substance, peppered withbeautifully written erotica, to produce a book that is at onceentertaining and informative. At one level, it's pure erotica. On another hand, Hunter's research into Inca history pays off with generally accurate descriptions of Incan society under Montezuma -- albeit written with poetic license and viewed through a gay lens. Highly recommended. END"
5,"GREAT SINGERS.....Girl, you know it's true","Rob and Fab were very good dancers, but they were even better singers. Boy could they belt out those tunes. ""Girl you know it's true"" was just one of several hit songs on their record by the same name. When I think of the 80s, I think of the greatest group of the decade, Milli Vanilli. I'm waiting for them to be inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. Great dancers. Great writers. But most of all, Milli Vanilli were superb singers. Girl, you know it's true. (Maybe not)"
1,Greatest Hits?,"How can they have a ""greatest hits"" album when they had only ONE album released? So, all the songs on the original album are... released. Hey! Buy the original and you'll have the greatest hits!"
3,milli vanilli- greatest hits,"excellent condition, fast servicethe only disappointment was that it didn't have the original single ""Girl You Know It's True"". There was only a remix:("
3,Not a cookbook?,"I saw the page for Ina's new book and anxiously went, grabbing my credit card number. But, alas, it is not to be so <slipping my AMEX back in my wallet>. This is a journal for writing down my recipes, not Ina's. Not for me. Ina's three other cookbooks are amazing, full of great recipes for things like coconut cupcakes and roasted vegetables. Easy stuff. Great stuff. Guess it'll have to be patient and wait on her next culinary writing adventure. In the meantime, I'll be watching her on Food Network."
2,pretty but not pratical,this book is pretty but does not have any dividers... just 100 blank pages... how are you supose to find a recipe? you have to flip thru the entire book....
2,No help here,"Apparently, the one thing harder than writing the second act is writing a book on writing the second act. The authors gives some examples of good second acts, uses wide margins, and there you go, a book about writing the second act. Or so he claims."
2,A bit thin and watery,"While the premise of the book, the concept focusing on the second act, is a very good one, what you actually get is rather watered down and a bit too basic. It always helps to learn from those who are themselves successful, and unfortunately I knew nothing about Halperin before reading his book. His resume includes basically being a staff writer for Star Trek Next Generation, Falcon's Quest, Quincy, and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, none of which stands out as a pillar of literary depth or quality (also note - none of these are FILMS, about which the book is supposed to teach.) There are many books out there written by more serious and talented writers that would be of much more use to an aspiring screenwriter."
2,Don't waste your money!,The book will not teach you how to write the second act. Please do not waste your time and money.
3,A decent collection,"This collection contains a few good tracks, but seems to have been put together with little or no thought.For instance, track 9 (""Tradicao"") is unmistakenly performed by Caetano Veloso. While this track originally appears on the 1994 Veloso/Gil duet album ""Tropicalia 2,"" the guitar-work of Gilberto Gil here hardly seems to make it appropriate for inclusion on a Gil compilation.The rest of the tracks are a mix of old Tropicalia songs and more recent work-- the whole thing just doesn't seem to go together well.Gilberto Gil is truly an amazing musician, but I venture to say that some of his early tracks suffer from dated production techniques. If you're looking for a great collection of more ""timeless"" songs by Mr. Gil, I recommend the ""The Early Years,"" released on Wrasse records-- truly a gem."
2,so icky,"I don't dispute the quality of the ginseng. However, I have used other Royal King ginsengs of different strengths and, while bitter, they were palatable. This one is like 13% alcohol and tastes so gross I can't gag it down. Try a different Royal King ginseng, avoid this one."
2,Yukky tasting,"This company delivered this product on time, and it was in an unbroken condition when it arrived, something some other companies can't seem to manage. But, with one taste of this product, I knew I couldn't choke a whole vial down, so I ended up throwing it away. I'm still looking for a reliable vendor for the 4500 mg strength ginseng, which tastes quite palatable. Asiachi.com was the vendor I used to use, but they don't have it anymore. Another vendor had it, but 4 of the vials were broken when I opened the box. I'm sure this would be a terrific product, if one can drink it; I've had great improvement in my energy levels with the 4500 mg, so I wish I could have handled this strength."
4,basis construction using wavelets is very well developed,"Although the notation can be a little tight, the explanation of theconstruction of a basis using wavelets is very well developed. He startswith finite dimensional spaces and then moves onto wavelets on the realline. He has a good series of graphs of signals and their correspondingwavelets transforms and points out meaningful features of the wavelettransform graph."
5,A Rose for Melinda,"Told through letters and e-mail, this is the story of Jessie Rose and Melinda Skye. The two friends exchange letters and e-mails for a year when Melinda comes down with leukemia. I really liked this book even though it left me heart-broken."
5,the BEST book i have EVER read,"I just finished this book about 15 minutes ago and i finally stopped crying. this HEART WRENCHING story of love and friendship will keep you hoping and wondering untill the last page. there isnt one thing about this book that i didnt like. you WILL get hooked. and when you finish make sure you have tissues, ive never sobbed that hard over a book. this book makes you realize just how lucky you are to be heathly and makes you want to go out and do something for everyone who sufferes from the horrible disease of cancer."
3,Not her best,"I think I've read all of Lurlene McDaniel's books, and I thought this was not one of her best books. I've enjoyed her books for years and feel she is an excellent author. But this book just didn't cut it. The story line was good, I just didn't like the way it was written."
3,Not one of her best,The book is good in a way but also confusing. I got confused with the timeline and I think the story advances to fast throughout the book
5,A Rose for Melinda is my favorite book,"A rose for melinda is a grate book it's so cool how she never gives up her dream of being a dancer!It is so sweet how she an Jesse her best friend (in the hole intire world) become in love and shear the life killing threat that melinda gets canser. Jesse willing to stick bye her side till she is old,but that plan dose not work out very well at all! Melinda gets canser and dies leving every one bhind soon they relize that crying is not going to bring her back so they sick together to stay strong and well.A rose for Melinda is a great book so I had to give it five stars because it has a great messeges!NEVER GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS!"
5,tissue warning!!,"WARNING: If you are considering reading this wonderful novel you must know that this one's a tear-jerker! But along with making my cry, this book also made me smile. The corespondence between Melinda and Jesse is great. Especially when they're in the first grade(dear melinda, the best part of school is seeing you. your very good friend, jesse). And when they're older, too(""But Its also a promise ring,because I want you to promise that someday you'll take a real ring from me and wear it forever.""). And I also think that her other friend ,Bailey, is just annoying. But over all a great book. :):( Manda"
3,Interesting,"When LM wrote Telling Christina Goodbye, I was happy becasue I though she was finally going to write about things other than illnesses (I love almost all of her books, but I just thought it was nice that she was writing about other stuff now), so I was pretty upset when I found out that her new book was about lukemia...AGAIN. Almost all of her books are about lukemia. But I got the book anyway and I'm glad I did. It was interesting reading Melinda's doctors reports and everything. It's told through letters, e-mails, im's, journal interies, phone calls, etc. It was really cute to see Jesse and Melinda's notes from when they were little! But other than the way it was told, it was a lot like her other books about girls who have lukemia. It was good, though, and I do recommend it. I just think LM should write about stuff other than just lukemia all the time."
3,LOVED it until...,"I LOVED the book... Until, SPOILER ALERT! The end! I recommend this book, but have tissues close once your close to the end!! :)"
2,Droops - Disappointed with this Clothesline,"I bought this for my patio. I live on the lake and always have towels in the summer. This line will not hold much weight at all. If you want it for sheets, would probably be fine, but don't expect to use it on normal weight or heavy items. I can't figure out if the line is stretching or if it is pulling more line out, but after about 5 mins I can check back on it and my articles are dragging the ground. Why make it 20 ft if it can't hold 20 ft worth of laundry? I understand the towels are heavy items, but does the same with t-shirts. I still use it, but only getting about 4 items hung on it at a time. I have to place 2 items on each end & leave the center empty to keep them from dragging the ground & even at that, they droop some. The concept is great, but I can't recommend it because of the above mention issue."
2,Look closer than I did,"When I bought this brush (2 actually), I could not make any sense of the size specs on the Amazon ad. Since I wanted them for my workshop and garden shed, I just assumed they were plastic versions of the wood-handled dust brush I already own. Not so, unfortunately.These things are like 2/3 scale, toy versions of a real brush. Also, the photo is misleading: its handle is actually longer than its head. The brush head itself is a mere 1 X 5 inches, and of generally low quality. Further, as another reviewer mentioned, the bristles arrived somewhat flattened, apparently from their original packaging.The shipping cost almost as much as the two brushes, so it is not worth my time to return them. I'll just limit my expectations, and hope I get some use from them."
4,Good but bend,What can one say about a brush. It does the job and is well made but looses a star because the bristles were bend on arrival due to poor packaging.
2,Redundant,"If you think you might want to read this book, at least get it from the library, then all you will have wasted is a few hours of your time. The stories are fairly redundant about philandering men and the women they use as speedbumps."
1,Cowboys something or other,"the book sucked as I bought it, was charged for it, and was asked to review it, but did not recieve it.so there.so much for my ereader book that I was going to bring on vacation.thanks Amazon.so, I can't even remember the damn title.argh. Cowboys Cowgirls. whatever."
1,weak writing about cowboys,"Glowing reviews to the contrary, this is the thinnest, most insipid writing I've ever tried to read. Superficial characters and cliched plots make Houston my nominee for most-hyped, least-deserving author of the decade."
5,Best story collection,"This is my favorite collection of stories ever. Pam Houston is an amazing writer, and an amazing woman. She writes beautifully with great detail and well thought out characters, even in just a few pages. Filled with a variety of heroines, and landscapes, and emotions. Deals with relationships, love, friendship, family in many insightful ways. Highly recommend."
4,A good collection of stories by a woman who enjoys men.,"This is the first work of Houston's I have read. As a man I enjoyed it very much. My primiary reaction was that I had been entertained with clean, crisp prose by a woman who appreciated and enjoyed the company of men."
4,Not quite all it's hyped to be...,"Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this collection of short stories quite a bit. It conveyed a certain feeling which, while I have never experienced as a 20-something man who has always lived in big cities, I felt like I did after reading her stories. The storeis were immensely readable, and quite engrossing, and the characters were very vividly portrayed. My only hesitation is that for all of the accolades this book has gotten, I think Judith Freeman does a similar thing in her writings, and does it better. So if you enjoyed this book (and I expect most of its readers will), I also suggest you check out FAMILY ATTRACTIONS or A DESERT OF PURE FEELING, for a book in a similar vein."
1,A poor depiction,"As the daughter of Viola Liuzzo, I would like to comment that my family was not pleased at all by this book. There were many inaccuracies and the writer made no attempt at all to consult with our family. In Contrast, ""From Selma to Sorrow"" by Mary Stanton is an accurate depiction of our mother and the events surrounding her death. Mary gave careful consideration to accurately report on the incident, without sensationalizing just to sell more copies. This is yet another attempt by someone to exploit my family for personal gain.Sally Liuzzo"
4,A Gritty Account of a Terrible Time in Our History,"I would highly recommend this book as a companion to Mary Stanton'sbook, ""From Selma to Sorrow."" The May account is far more grittyand insistent on exposing the ugliness of both the Liuzzo events andthe predjudices of the time. The book is a terrible journey into aland and a time of inner and outer darkness and turmoil."
1,Gary May has never spoken to or met Viola Liuzzo's sister,I am Viola Liuzzo's sister and have never met or spoken to Gary May. Shame on him for telling such a lie.Rose Mary Sprout Lemming
5,Excellent Product - Simplicity that Works,"I use the DSM-910BT to stream internet radio from a computer in my upstairs office to the living room downstairs. Setup was simple and the wireless connection established quickly and easily. No interference problems and the audio quality is excellent. Only quibble is that the Bluetooth range is somewhat limited. The ""up to"" 30m transmission range seems highly optimistic. Even 10m between floors or rooms seems on the high side."
3,Interesting reading,"Since the author's focus is on home prepared diets, I didn't expect to be guided through the processed food choices. While the book does not give recipes for home cooking, it is interesting to note the authors descriptions of variances in foods between breeds. The point of one generic diet being optimal for any dog ( as processed food companies would have us believe ) is shattered here. I tried to come up with recipes for my dog that included foods the author suggests and eliminated the items that would theoretically offend. What I discovered is that my dog is an individual and does not follow the mold in this book. But after reading this material, I found a dog dietician on the net and this became my dog's saving grace. I doubt I would ever have considered this without reading this book."
1,"Get the Kindle version, instead: it's free","This version of the Handbook is completely without illustrations, as is the Kindle version. The difference is: the Kindle version is free. The actual value of an unillustrated handbook is considerably less than the $30+ asking price here, unless you happen to be well versed in reading blazons. Even then you would miss subtle points which could be gleaned from the illustrations, keeping its value low. If you stumble on it, the illustrated version is shown, in all its glory, and can be purchased (for less than $30,) but the version you can purchase here is a poor shadow. Caveat emptor!"
2,The Handbook to English Heraldry,"I bought this as I thought it would be useful for genealogical research, but I found it complicated and hard to read. Was not what I expected from the write up."
3,its ok,"I have not watched yet,there were dirt or fingerprint marks on the DVD,I assume it will play very well thought."
5,MY REVIEW,"Thanks, got the product in perfect shape in a timely manner.Will use you again. This product was for my brother who hasspecial needs he loves Tim Conway. Thanks for having itavailable and at such a good price."
4,Heart-warming Comedy,"If you enjoy Tim Conway, you'll love this story. A dog teaches and guides him through his adventures and they become best friends as he learns that the dog is smarter than he is. Cute, funny, and heartwarming. You'll be rooting them on to overcome all of the obstacles. Great DVD...."
1,Not worth it,"This movie is so frustrating! It is slap stick comedy to the extreme, and is just so frustrating, that you can't really enjoy it."
3,"If looking for family pictures, send me some clues","Critics of TV violence have counted hundreds, even thousands of violent scenes in Walt Disney pictures. This film can be recommended to children over 10 years old, I guess. It is frightening to watch Mara's parents get killed by a bear. Adam West from Batman does well as the game warden who wants to rescue Mara from an evil fur trapper. He discovers her taking a bath in a pond near the company of her wolf companions. Is it true that the fight scene at the end was longer on video tape? It seems to be."
3,Alluring Allan without da Book!,"As usual, the music is not for the squeamish! Having seen himperform ""live"", it does not disappoint. Technically & sonically outside the usual, he & his band are both inspiring and antiseptic. His matter-of-fact explanations for his excursions onto the complete fretboard layout ofeach chord, vs. just throwing in substitutions, is actually very simple tocomprehend. Of course, his acknowledged different approach to applying itleft me scratching my head - and cursing my hands - but what a great dilemma to have! I would rate it 5 stars if the referred-to booklet was tobe found, either in the jacket or separate package or . . ."
1,Please run dont walk away from this product,"Horrid..........like it was made in a head start game development learning lab and thats being kind. This is the worse product ever, graphics are horrible, wont learn a thing but maybe go blind from looking at the crazy colors and graphics"
3,Really wish I didn't order it.,"I have been an Obus backrest user for years. They are not that comfortable, but using them continuously does wonders for your back problem.However, I just can't see any benefit from the seat. It does make some seats softer, but $ 50 is a lot for what I consider a cosmetic item. Put your money into another backrest."
3,Not made for heavy people!,"Product was Great for about a week. Product is obviously not made for anyone over above 250 lbs. Still feels better than my junk chair, but in the future I will purchase a better chair."
4,I need more padding.,"This is a quality product and I like that the front 1/3 is removable for shorter chairs or seats. I have a terrible back situation (scoliosis, double curve, operated on over 30 yrs ago) plus a rear end collision last year. I am doing all that I can to keep my back in shape. I bought this to add more support to my Herman Miller Aeron chair. I also bought the back support on eBay. I wish the seat had more cushion. I can feel the wires surrounding each 1/3 of the cushion. It almost feels like a wire hanger under a foam cushion. Don't get me wrong, I'm sitting on it now and it does make the front end of my chair more comfortable for my legs. I'm glad I bought it, but my boney a.. needs more than this provides."
3,Don't like the feeling of wire beneath,"The cushion of my chair became pretty much useless after a half year purchasing the chair, and therefore I started to try putting on chair cushions. The first one I tried was, Obus Forme because of good rating. However, when I tried it, it was disappointing. The cushion itself is not bad, but I can feel the wire beneath, and it is just awkward and not very comfortable for me. Since I have open the package and tried sitting on it, I could not return and have to sell it, but considering shipping and reduced price, there was pretty much no difference if I jut throw it away. I would recommend Memory Foam Seat Rest instead of this."
4,An Early Miss Silver Mystery,"I can't believe that I'm the first to review a book that was written in 1939. If you are a Miss Silver fan, then you should read this book. This is an early volume from the series. It's important to see her development throughout the many years that Ms. Wentworth wrote of her. This book, like many in the series is a little dated, but it's still a smashing good mystery. Ms. Wentworth is a fine example of golden age detective story writing and quite incomparable when it comes to writing British country-house murder mysteries. In this book Miss Silver is asked by Rachel Treherne to come to her manor house to determine who among her large extended family is trying to kill her. Miss Silver investigates in her own unique style, and quickly determines who the culprit is, but then it's a matter of getting the proof."
3,The Lust of Gain in the Heart of Cain,"Rachel Treherne goes to London to see Maud Silver, described as a little woman in a snuff-colored dress. Miss Treherne is a woman driven by fear. Rachel Treherne thinks someone is trying to kill her. The culprit may be someone close to her and she is in considerable danger. Miss Silver is to pose as a visitor to the household.In mystery story terms the plot is stream-lined, spare. It isn't a case of a locked-room, but the cast of characters and thus, suspects, is limited. Dangers faced by Rachel Treherne are truly terrifying. Family members concerned about money may be driven to do despicable things.Miss Silver is of immense help in finding the solution to the puzzle. Some members of the family consider Maud Silver to be of no consequence and speak freely in her presence. Her tone of dryness and objectivity, (she displays an utter lack of sentiment), contributes to the excellent means the author uses to convey Rachel Treherne's dilemma to the reader."
4,All Patricia Wentworths are well worth reading,"Lonesome Road is a good example of her wonderful style. It has a cast of interesting characters, whom only Miss Silver can read. I love Maudie!"
1,Poor Quality,"Don't waste your money. The DVD versions are straight copies of the VHS tapes (poor VHS quality). There is no attempt to ""teach"" just straight display of a word and then they speak it (in poor audio quality). In a video you'd expect extensive usage of images yet much of the content is just a black screen with white words or phrases displayed.Don't waste your money (or time) on these videos unless you get them from a bargain bin for less than $10 each."
5,Useful Guidelines,"This book is full of many useful ideas to stimulate additional research and thought. As a professional writer, I use the book frequently to generate ideas for columns, articles, and reports.Most of the ideas listed in the book are somewhat broad and need refining, but that's the point. This book will provide clear, easy to understand categories that help you determine specific areas of interest. And as any writer knows, finding the topic is often the hardest part of the process."
4,A Must Need for High School Students,This book is very good in helping students get their ideas together and putting them down. As a high school student I use this book frequently to make speeches for clubs and other things.
3,I thought this was a comedy - 3 3/4 stars,"I thought this was supposed to be a comedy. While the movie was good, I wasn't laughing much. It's full of excitment but no so much on the laughter.MAIN STORYLINE : When her husband loses his job, Bridget (Keaton) need cash fast. When she lands a job as a jaintor at the Federal Reserve Bank, her plan : steal money going out of circulation. She enlists the help of 2 people : 1. The one who shreds the money (Latifah) and the woman who pushes the carts of money around (Holmes).PROS1. Overall, it's a great movie2. great CastingCONS1. Not so comedic2. Unoriginal storyline - The movie is a remake of the British movie ""Hot Money""3. No Subtitles.I just felt the movie could have been funnier and the dvd to have subtitles. I like to read what I am hearing. And while the movies gets a thumbs up, because I didn't laugh so much at this ""comedy"", it's not worth the whole 5 stars"
4,Cute Movie,"This isn't the best movie, but it is still worth a watch. I own this because I really enjoyed it and feel the ending wasn't really that predictable. It was filled with drama and a great storyline that kept me interested. Although it is probably more along the lines of a chick flick, I still think its a great movie to watch, at least once"
4,A nice TV movie would have been better,"""Mad Money"" would have been a better TV movie.The cast was excellent,but not enough laughts.The ending shows us Crime really pays,like Wall Street is telling us in real life Today."
2,A mildly humorous wisp of a movie,"Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes steal millions from the Fed. As the film opens they've been caught, and they're being questioned by the FBI. Flashback to how they did it. If this sounds familiar, it is. You've seen it before. These fine actresses turn in decent comic performances, but there's no suspense, and with the possible exception of Latifah, it's hard to care about the characters one way or the other. Wait for late night cable to see this one."
4,Great Movie,I chose this movie because I liked the actors. The story line was interesting and creative and the humor was intelligent.
1,More Holes Than A Box Of Fruit Loops,"This is probably the worst movie I have seen this year, a failure on so many levels. It's a comedy without laughs and a crime caper without drama. To say the story is not realistic would be a gross understandment.The characters played by Diane Keaton and Katie Holmes are not only ridiculous but downright irritating. Queen Latifah's character, a single mom who wants a better life for her sons, is somewhat more sympathetic. But really she is the only bright side in this cinematic disaster. Avoid at all costs."
2,Whap!,I think I could have liked this movie more if I hadn't spent most of it wanting to reach through the screen to SMACK Diane Keaton--or at least her character.
1,Another American film copying a British theme,"This film follows the EXACT storyline down to the littlest details of a programme in the UK called 'Hot Money', only difference is the countries they take place in. America copies everything the UK offers - make up your own scripts!!!!"
3,It does work for me,"It does calm me down, but does not help wirh my sleep issues. I still wake up after 4 to 5 hours. But, after a couple of hours or so, I am able to get back to sleep. Next day, I am not groggy, but calmer using this product.Also, I have chronic headaches and it seems to take the edge off the worry (not anxiety), that I experience with the chronic pain.I had hoped that it would help with the sleep issues, for that reason, the three stars."
2,Poor but brutal!,"Their first well produced album, giving them a more tense and brutal sound. The only thing to be aknowledged on this album is Fredrik's drumming, one wonders where he gets the energy.Over all its poor, full of energy but not the dark energy you look for in black metal."
2,Need gas mask! Noxious fumes for days!,I would gladly provide a written review about the comfort and quality of this gel seat/cushion BUT it cannot be used in the home until the VERY OFFENSIVE odors are gone. How many days? I do not know! Possibly formaldehyde or ??? The cushion seems comfortable if you can tolerate the noxious gases from the packaging and the cushion. Good luck!
1,dissatisfied,"The photograph is misleading. It looks like it is raised in the back and would protect your tailbone. It is flat and , for me, was not comfortable."
2,Nothing but a cushion,"Nothing more than a cushion, get the original Obus Forme seat, it may now be called Conair, a much better product for those with back issues. This seat looks indented but it is really quite flat."
4,"Comfortable sitting, but not perfect",I actually like this product since what I was using before was a thick foam cusion with a sitzbone cut-out and it is no longer available through sharper image.I tried LOTS of other things and this is the most comfortable seat when you have back issues of any kind. I can't say it provides a lot of support but it does reduce pain onset from sitting too long in one position.
2,Item over hipped,Item does not look any thing like the picture. It is flat. I don't feel any difference when I am setting for long periods of time.
1,Smell is Unbearable,"The cushion comes with an insert saying that the off-gassing is normal and will subside within two days. This is absolutely not true. I found no reduction in the truly offensive odor in a week. I even put it outdoors on the porch. Since I was looking for comfort, I tried putting the cushion into a plastic bag, just to try the feel. My advice to others would be to keep looking for an alternative to this product. There is nothing special about the design. It is not a fraction as comfortable as the pictures suggest, and the smell is not just obnoxious but probably wretchedly unhealthy. I returned it, at my expense, and received a refund."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"First of all the ad is completely misleading. It appears to be a formed cushion with a raised back and a seat that has a formed butt imprint. What you get is a flat cushion where nothing is raised anywhere and there is no form or shape. It is totally opposite from what you think you are getting. I used it anyway to see if it made any difference or if it was magically going to form to my rear. Needless to say, that didn't happen. I could have thrown any cushion in the chair and that would have served the same purpose. I'm not going to the trouble of sending it back but if I were Amazon, I'd take it off my website. Don't waste your money!"
3,Helps a little,I purchased this gel seat thinking it would be somewhat thicker and more cushion. It does help relieve some pressure but I suppose it would depend on the person at what level it would help.
3,Picture Misleading But Still Does It's Job,"I purchased this item so I could work from home due to a recent surgery. My home office chair is pretty standard, but certainly not overly cushioned. The picture makes this thing look four times thicker than it actually is, so one star dropped off for that. The other star I took off is because it required a down pillow to be under it to make it properly cushion my bottom. However, I am ordering another one for my regular office as that chair has more cushion and should not prove to be an issue. If you have one of those wooden or metal chairs that has no seat padding at all, this will probably not work for you. That said, this would likely be a good choice for most car seats."
4,"Fairly comfortable, wish it was thicker","I sit in my desk chair several hours per day. My otherwise comfortable chair is suffering from thinning padding on the seat, so I bought this cushion to get more life out of the chair. I was immediately pleased with the results, and now one month later the cushion still seems in fine shape. It is not super-duper comfortable like I was hoping, but at least it does cushion the hardness that I feel protruding up through the padding of my chair. The gel seems to work great at holding its shape (note that the cushion is not shaped like in the picture but is in reality more flat). Maybe if it was a little thicker then I would have gotten that ""ahhhh"" super comfortable seat I was hoping for. I give 4 stars because it is doing what it's supposed to do, just not spectacularly.Edit: November, about 10 months later -- still using this cushion and am really pleased with how well it has held up! I think I like it more now than when I first got it. :)"
1,Just an expensive cushion,This is a nothing special cushion. I find the seams really irritating to sit on and the padding is nothing to brag about.
3,nothing spectacular,"It is a soft seat, but nothing spectacular. It did not help with the pain I have when sitting, but that is not to say that it would not help someone else."
2,Not very soft,"I purchased this for use in office on office chair. I wanted it as the chair I have while padded is pretty hard. When you read Gel Seat you figure it will be somewhat sort and conforming to your self.This feels like a solid piece of foam, has no gel qualities and not very soft. I would not recommend it if you are looking for something to use to pad a seat and have gel qualities.I should have returned it at once but made the error of disposing of the wrappings and the box. This is probably the first time I purchased something on Amazon that I was not happy with and am just going to give it to another worker and look for a true Gel Seat."
3,Obus Forme Gel Seat,It isn't as supportive or cushioney as I was hoping. After sitting on it for a few hours it goes flat and hard.
1,"Hasn't helped me at all, actually made me hurt worse.","I was really hoping to get some kind of relief with this cushion. After finding out that I have 2 bulged discs in my lower back that are pinching my sciatic nerve I've been looking for something to help me sit more correct and help relieve the pain from sitting at my desk job. Well 1st it looks nothing like they percieve it to look like on the net. It is definately does not have any form to it what so ever, it is totally flat. 2nd it has made my hip pain worse! Gave it a week and just can't take it any longer, gonna see if I can return it."
4,Good For The Car,"I bought this for my boyfriend who has neuropathy and arthritis. Having never tried a gel seat cushion before we didn't know what to expect. It is comfortable and its a good cushion for portability. He likes to use it in the car, or when we go to the doctors office. It is somewhat thin though, and he would have preferred it if the cushion were thicker, more substantial. Still, like I said, its a good, lightweight, compact cushion, so its easy to take it with you should you need to."
3,nonconforming,"I think the same thing to another buyer. The photograph is misleading. It looks like it is raised in the back and would protect your tailbone. It is flat and , for me,.. I do not like, I wanted something better. is comfortable, but my request is not. as mentioned earlier, The photograph is misleading."
4,Suprisingly astonished!,"At first I, almost did not buy this book. But something about it caught my attention and I decided to take a chance. I was amazed at how fast I was drawn in and reading it straight through. I am not usually one for vampire related novels but I just couldn't put this down.The characters are relatable and yet still fantasic. The story is well laid out and keeps you interested. The sense of humor is also woven in and yet the book still keeps its dark tone. A real page turner, extremely well done!!Unknown Author or not, Its worth the read!!!"
1,Trying to be nice,Well after buying some of Italy's best pots or cookware...where the inside is a slick finish...not sand coated...(Le Creusant)I was hoping that someone else had come up with a pot as good or a skillet if you may...however I am disappointed in my skillet...yes it has a sandy finish or rough if you will...not what I was looking for ...it however does cook very well or fry...and does clean up easy...hey would spend a few hundred bucks to find the skillet I want ...these guys just don't have it...the wording of the skillet did not indicate a rough inside finish.
1,Do not get for a Macintosh unless you are desperate,"Version 7.1.3b4Bounceback was highly recommended a few years ago in article in MacWorld and/or MacUser. I bought it based on that recommendation. I have sucessfuly used it to back up my computer, so it is not a complete waste of money. It is exceptionally buggy. The interface is exceptionally non-intuitive. The interface resembles nothing like a typical Macintosh interface. The program causes crashes and freezes. It is hard to know if a backup was completely successful. Probably some of the interface difficulties come from translation form a foreigh language into non-standard English. The upgrade for Macintosh appears to lag the upgrade for PCs by many months. I have used it with a variety of computers and OS configurations 10.3-10.5.If you have no other back-up solution, this porgram can be used successfully by a persistent watchful Macintosh-proficient user."
2,"Buy ""Asterix and the Big Fight"" instead","This is the film version of ""Asterix and the Big Fight"" -- buy that one, not this -- it's just a rehash."
4,"Suspenseful, believable, a psychological thriller",A successful single business women living by herself in a high rise...and some one is watching her. The walls have eyes... He knows her every move...
1,Wasn't it turned into a movie?,"Wasn't this a movie? I thought it started Melanie Griffin and the guy from mr. mom. I didn't read the book but saw the movie. It was lame, bad plot, and you couldn't feel for the characters. I was rooting for them all to die!"
1,A disappointing novel from a master novelist. See the movie.,"For Levin and Levin fans this is a disappointing novel. The story line is long, drawn out and not very exciting. The reader is hoping constantly that the next chapter will bring an actual event but each page only brings disappointment. The climax at the end of the novel passes uneventfully and you should be careful that you don't miss it. A poor effort for Levin who has written a number of very good and imaginative stories that you can't put down. Better luck next time Ira. For prospective readers - see the movie instead"
2,I've seen better,"This book was a bit disappointing. It was better to see the movie, and the storyline was a bit boring. I've seen better work from Ira"
4,great book,"Ignore the movie. Read this great book by Ira Levin. Smart dialogue, a sexy protagonist, and some biting commentary on the state of literature today, Sliver is an effective thriller that far surpasses the movie. The book reads like a movie script (which was done purposefully), but the makers of the movie unwisely deviated from the effective and thrilling plot here"
1,I would rather scrub a public toilet than read this again.,"This has got to be one of THE worst books I have ever read. Anal sex, abrupt endings, and horrible diagolue do not a great novel make"
2,FAVOLOSO!!!,This is a must have! Verbs can be so tricky when learning Italian...don't give up - this book will help you gain confidence in using the correct tense and you will be able to create sentences that will make actual sense!? E scusatemi se e' poco! In bocca al lupo a tutti. Comunque potevano aggiungere altri verbi...tutto sommato e' abbastanza buono!
4,Completo,"The definitive guide to Italian verbs. If you are taking Italian lessons and need a book on Italian verbs I don't think you can find another as comprehensive as this. It's like the old TV commercial ""verbs-this is all we do and we do it well."" Keep in mind this is a reference book for Italian verbs and not a reader."
5,I love this guide!,This book has been the best way for me to practice my Italian because the words are already conjugated. It helps with grammar too!
4,Fits my needs well,I've had this book for years and have always considered it an important part of my Italian language library.
2,"I like ""the Big Green Book of Italian Verbs"" better","This book is ok, but it's missing a lot of useful words that can easily be found in the Big Green Book of Italian Verbs which I also got here on Amazon. This book also has some words that aren't in the other one, but I find that for me a word I need is never in this book and always in the green book.I also don't like that this book won't lie flat open on a page on your desk. Because of it's size you have to hold it open onto the page whereas the Green book will lie flat and stay put if you open to a page and leave it open on your desk. I ended up never using this book because the other one was so much better... but I know some people like to have both in case a word isn't available in one of them."
4,Best for Beginners,"This guide got me through my first year of Italian studies, with almost all of the verbs (and definitely all the tenses) I needed for basic composition and conversation. Certain verbs are missing, and the names of the tenses are in English (all students I know learn the names of the tenses in Italian; I had to read the guide in the beginning of the book to figure out what I wanted). This book worked through Beginning Italian I & II, but a more comprehensive guide is needed for Intermediate levels."
4,Good...,"I'm an Italian fifteen boy and I love foreign languages. I think Italian verbs are very difficult for english people, cos' verbs change during the coniugation (like: io vado, tu vai egli va, noi andiamo, voi andate, essi vanno). I think 501 verbs are a lot!I've found an error in the ABBRONZARE pages. Don't say TI PIACE ABBRONZARE? but TI PIACE ABBRONZARTI? and it's wrong also NON ABBRONZARE TROPPO!, that's NON TI ABBRONZARE TROPPO!It's a good support to every course."
5,For the serious learner,"If you really want to know how to speak Italian correctly & not just tourist Italian, then you MUST know the proper verb usage. This book is not for the beginner or faint of heart learning la lingua. Because it can be overwhelming to open this book and see that each Italian verb has 14 formats, that then break into male/female & singular/plural formats. I myself (now into my 2nd year of learning the language) continuously refer to this book. A nice bonus is the CD-Rom which has plenty of exercises to help you build & remember the verb formats. Good luck my fellow Italian language students, we all need it! =)"
1,feh,While I find the printed portion of the book useful the CD does not operate in a Mac with an operating system beyond 10.4 so the CD is useless.
5,One of the necessary learning tools for serious students,"So many people ask me about what learning materials I recommend for beginning students. Well, here is the ""magic recipe""! Purchase this book plus ""Italian Verb Drills"", plus ""Essential Italian Grammar"", plus ""Pimsleur's Basic Italian"" (audio CD set) and you're on your way to speak the most romantic and musical language on the planet!!! That's all you need!! Well, now it's up to you to TAKE THE FIRST STEP and be patient! Results will come before you know it, just put the effort in and it will come back 10-fold!Don't forget the NECESSITIES to learning a language: PRACTICE, REPETITION, and PATIENCE!"
5,510 Verbs - A MUST Have!,"Great for anyone studying Italian. When you have a problem, flip to the verb to see any tense conjugated for you. Easy to use and has most used verbs in Italian."
2,"Read Carefully - ""Free"" CD provides little value","The CD-ROM includes ONLY some exercises, which are limited and relatively useless. The CD does not include the verbs and their conjugations so I must lug this cumbersome and heavy book around, instead of accessing the verbs from my lightweight laptop."
3,"OK reference, but lacking . . .","I'm disappointed that the first verb I looked up, ""provare"" (to try) was not in this book. How many other verbs will be missing? I'm looking for another definitive guide to italian verbs now, or maybe a new edition with some modifications?"
4,Best on the market,I really wanted more verbs (like 700?) but found that some fairy common verbs were listed in the back of the book. They had their meaning and then referred you to a page with a verb that is conjugated the same way. Whew....at first I was a little dismayed but now I'm happy. I couldn't find another book that was any better!
1,Kindle edition is useless,"I loved this in ""book"" form, so I thought I would buy it for my Kindle as well. However, when it was delivered to my Kindle Global, I found 2 major flaws. While the ""text"" is legible, the font of the verb tables is so small that you cannot even read it with a magnifying glass, and increasing the font on the Kindle does not affect it. Also, you cannot ""search"" for anything in this book, so it is impossible to find a verb without paging through one page at a time. This makes the Kindle edition totally useless. I don't know if it is any better on the larger screen Kindle, but for the current ""Global"" Kindle it does not work."
2,silver earrings,I was not happy when I received these earrings as they are too small to handle with acrylic nails. If I had made it to the postoffice they would have sent them back.
4,Reading and Learning to Read,A concise text explaining everything an educator needs to know to develop and expand a literacy program.
1,Never could get the correct book!,"If you need this book for a course, then don't purchase it from Amazon. I purchased it the first time and received a totally incorrect book in return. When I called customer service, I was told that the correct book would be sent to me immediately. I received the same incorrect book again. So I finally sent both of the incorrect books back to Amazon and I am waiting to get my refund. Therefore, it is difficult for me to review this book since I could never get through Amazon."
5,Arrived promptly,Purchasing this book for the minimal price was a great option to reading the downloaded version. It arrived on time and promptly.
4,fine condition and fast Delivery,"It was in fine condition with highlighted pages, but that's alright, I can read it. I liked the fast Delivery, it came when I needed it.....Thanks."
2,Will you get what you pay for?,"Though part of an ""exegetical series"", this book is largely a pastoral and homilectic commentary on 1 Cor 5. Anyone looking for a serious exegetical examination of 1 Cor 5 will be dissappointed with this book. Apart from some lexical insights, there is no exegesis going on here and no dialogue with any recent (i.e. the past 30 years)literature, Most of the author's own bibliography is very, very dated and his claim that little scholarly attention is devoted to this chapter is simply inaccurate. A quick review of current literature on 1 Corinthians will show that a number of scholarly articles take up the issues addressed in 1 Cor 5 and a number of monographs treat the chapter quite extensively. Readers looking for a more complete exegetical and theological treatment of the issues in 1 Cor 5 would do well to look elsewhere."
3,Titles included have changed,"(...) Unfortunately, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is not included in this disk. Nosferatu, The Last Laugh, and Der Golem are packaged together from Triton Media. Bummer, huh?"
5,PARA AMANTES DEL DANCE.,"Todos los exitos mas conocidos de ""LA BOCA"", en una muy buena presentación. Quizá podría incluir alguna cancion más. Asi y todo es muy bueno."
1,"They are not large, just regular size","They are quite expensive for 50 regular sized paper cups. I was expecting large muffin tin size paper cups. I did get a free silicone spoon, so that's why I'm not sending them back."
4,striding Folly,"I'm still reading this book. So farso good. It's light reading, which is what I like. I will probably get more of this series."
3,Lacks dramatic tension,"Three short stories. In the first, the solution is given too early, in the second, the solution seems trite and improbable, and in the third, the crime isn't really serious enough to hold the reader's attention. Not up to her unusal standard."
5,Highway pegs,"These are the best highway pegs I've ever owned!Great price, great service. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this site again!"
5,very nice for any fan,"If you know someone who is a Lord of the Rings fan, this is the game set for them. The quality is nice and the graphics are pics from the movies. I would recommend it."
3,Not our favorite but not horrible,This is an O.K. book. I bought two books for my son about using the potty and he prefers the other to this one but he will ask for me to read it once in a while.
1,"Cute, but not durable!","This is a cute book, but the flusher stopped working after about 6 months of use. Very disappointing!"
4,a good quick reference,This book is an easy to carry around very good quisk reference forsetting up and using the OSx Tiger operating system.The book covers most issues quite well.Small enough to carry in your laptop case.
2,"Tedious, self-indulgent","I had heard good things about the author's work before but had not read any myself. I came away disappointed. There are flashes of great insight at times and the author is obviously smart and well read. But after a while it becomes clear that convincing the reader of those two points is the author's main aim. The book makes readers embarrassed for not knowing the details of 18th century, obscure texts, and the author dismisses the work of other leading political theorists with one line throw away sentences. I forced myself to finish, but in the end, I agreed with Melbourne that the work is fundamentally tedious and self-indulgent."
2,Erudite but unfocused,"Have to agree with the reviewer from Melbourne on this one. Herzog says in the introduction that he eschews any overarching methodology, laudable in theory I suppose but not very good in practice. The result is a rather meandering narrative that lacks the benefit of a clear central argument to structure it. Probably the main strength of the book is that it draws on a staggeringly broad set of texts. [To be fair, I have not read the entire book, so you can take my criticisms with a grain of salt I suppose, though I do think I have grasped the essentials of his text.]"
1,Boring Tedious,"This book has a promising subject, the creation of conservative politics in England. In promotional material the book has been described as explaining the sorts of ideas which were developed as a reaction to the pressure for democratic change in England as a result of the French Revolution. Such a book would have been interesting.This book rather than looking at the institutional structure of England and the response of its elite's is a mishmash of written material at the time. It rambles is unfocused and one wonders what is the point. The book is more a display of the author's knowledge rather than trying to look at the attitudes of the time and to see how they tied in with the structure of power. The book is very much an ""academic treatment"" in the worst possible use of that label."
2,Difficult to Read,This book was on my reading list and I must say it is one of the hardest books I have ever had to read. The print was ultra fine and the lanuguage hard to digest.
1,BEWARE: This only covers the World Series games,"I was shocked when I got this DVD, that it included almost nothing about any of the amazing series' leading up to the World Series (only a few 30 second clips). I have other World Series DVDs, and they all include a recap of the post-season prior to the World Series before moving on to the series. It is quite fair to say that the Red Sox and Cubs series' were the highlights of the post-season. Not to get a recap of those series' is a travesty. This was a complete waste of money. I doubt I will ever watch it again."
2,Weak,"Okay, for the 4 Marlins fans in existence this DVD is great. For everybody else who witnessed one of the best post seasons of all time, don't expect to find any of it here. With all the capabilities of DVD's this one could have been done on VHS. And to all you Yankee haters out there...please come back when you have 26 rings."
4,Great product for the money...no sagging issues,"I bought two of these and they're great. They're easy to install & remove because of the keyhole-shaped holes in the bracket...all I have to do is lift it off of the screws to take it off. I sometimes take one from outside and put it inside on some screws I leave in the wall so that I can dry clothes inside if it's raining...takes 2 seconds and doesn't require any tools.Some of the reviews I read mentioned sagging issues. I wrap the rope around the cleat at the bottom of the housing twice and haven't had any sagging problems at all. Wrap it around once, pull it tight, then pull some slack out of the unit itself to wrap it around a second time. Works great."
3,It gets the job done.,"It does ok for a small amount of clothes. The line stretches if loaded to much,but it is new.I would buy again if needed."
1,Lousy Item,"Lehigh RC20 20-Foot Retractable ClotheslineFirst, it does NOT lock in an extended position.Second, the line stretches with anything heavier than nylon panties on it.Like everything manufactured today, there simply is NO quality."
3,It's okay.,"We haven't used it a ton yet because we are having trouble finding the perfect spot for it in our yard. When we have used it, we find the cord to be a little weak...towels make it droop. It seems like it should have some sort of stopper to keep the cord taught. We purchased it to use mainly for drying cloth diapers, which we haven't started using yet, but we imagine it will be fine for that, since they are light-weight."
2,Below my expectations,The weight of the clothing causes the line to not hold its tension. My clothes end up near the ground.
2,Needs Improvement,"It is very easy to install, and it retracts its clothesline easily. The problem is that it is very hard to make the clothesline tight so that your wet clothes would not drag on the ground. You do need to wrap the clothesline around the little arm on the unit in order to stop the clothesline from sagging. You have to wrap the clothesline around a little piece of plastic with one hand while trying to pull the clothesline real hard to make it as tight as possible with the other hand. I have not been successful with pulling my 40-feet clothesline tight enough so that a wet bathtowel does not touch the ground in the middle. The manufacturer needs to add some kind of a pulling devise to it."
3,"Works great, but . . .","the latch that attaches to the hook broke on the first one I bought and on the replacement line as well. Otherwise, this clothesline would be perfect for my backyard. I use it all year retracting it back in when not in use. The problem is when it is windy, the weight of the clothes is too much and the plastic latch/hasp at the end of the line breaks. I am now debating on whether or not to order my third clothesline or find another design. It would be perfect if this piece was metal."
5,There's a trick to tensioning the clothesline.,"A few reviewers have commented that you need to pull the clothesline out all the way or it sags. If you look on the bottom of the unit, there's a little knob that resembles the cleats to which you tie up boats on docks. Just wrap it around 3/4 of a turn and the clothesline will stay plenty tight. I have a feeling this also reduces the wear and tear on the spring inside the unit and that it might last longer as a result."
5,Rectractable Clothes Line,"Works great - easy to install and use. I have a small apartment with a small washer/dryer, plus I'm at the beach and have a wet suit. I can hang any clothes I need, then retract the cord when it's not needed. It's EXACTLY what I wanted."
1,Stopped working after a minimum number of uses,"This is called a retractable clothes line for a reason: Because it retracts. Or is supposed to. Its retractability was the big appeal for me, since I don't want to have a clothes line strung across my backyard except for when I need it. I used this clothes line 10 times or less, and then it stopped working. It suddenly stopped retracting one day, out of the blue. That amounts to about $1.50 per use, which isn't the end of the world. But why can't companies make good, durable products anymore? We waste so many natural resource manufacturing and shipping what amounts to lots of crap nowadays. Oh well, I can still use the clothes line, but instead of retracting the line I have to coil it up by hand and hang it over the unit that it's supposed to retract into. If you don't mind doing that yourself, buy away!"
4,Works Fine,I've used mine this whole summer and it is holding up just fine. A prior review mentions that the line does not stay taught. I experienced the same until I re-read the directions and now I have no problems.
3,For light loads only,"Works adequately for light loads (t-shirts, socks and under things) but the line slips when there is too many items on the line even when wrapped around the peg per the instructions. Perhaps if the line was not so slick this wouldn't happen. Jeans and heavy cotton towels cannot be hung from this line when extended out to its full length.I purchased this retractable clothes line to use while looking for a replacement for my electric clothes dryer that had died. Installation is fairly simple. I attached the retractable unit on to the side of my house on an exterior window frame. The hook for the line is attached to a tree approximately 40 feet away. I extend the line to the hook in the tree, wrap the line around the peg per the instructions and then adjust the tension and try to get as taught as possible.Overall I'd say this product works as expected for light loads and is worth the money paid. I've only used this product for 1 summer so only time will tell if it is durable."
1,line is stretchy and won't stay taut,"buy the honey can do instead. this line by crawford-lehigh is of a plastic that stretches and slips, effectively dumping your clean laundry on the ground! not good!"
5,Excellent product!!!,"I use this in my 12ft laundry room.I have no complaints, i even hang wet towels on it.Very sturdy, very effective. Highly recommended!!!"
1,Is not taut!,"I purchased a similar one of these a couple of years ago but left it when I moved. Thought I would get another, but this one is terrible. I'm not sure if I got a faulty one, but there is no way to hang clothes without them lying on the ground. Each article of clothing I add makes the line sink lower and lower. Thought maybe there was a way to lock it in place (since it doesn't do it automatically) but can't find one. It's all loose and continues to give as clothes are added. Clearly not how clothesline are intended to work. Terrible, will be returning."
3,Broken after one use.,"Received the product quickly and installed it with some heavy duty wood screws I bought from Home Depot. Hung my first load of laundry on it, and it seemed to hold well. When I removed my clothes the plastic hook that the vinyl line is tied to broke. I'm going to contact the company and ask for a new piece. Although I may just end up removing the broken plastic part and tying a loop at the end of the line.We'll see if this thing holds up - as the rest of the product seems fairly sturdy."
3,"Okay, but not very good for anything heavy.","The concept of this is good. It seems like a great idea. However, in practice, any heavier items stretch the line so that the items almost brush the ground. I'm not sure if the line itself stretches or if the holder doesn't keep the line from spooling more out under the weight of clothes hanging on it. Not horrible - I just put the heavier items on the ends of the line. The best thing available for the purpose; maybe someone will tweak the design.Incidentally, the round plastic piece holding it to the hook broke. Again, not horrible - I just tied the cord around the remnant of plastic and it stayed fine."
4,Great Item,The clothesline works great. It is a little larger than I had realized but well worth the purchase.
4,KMcNabb,I already had a clothes line like this at our vacation house. I like it because it retracts and is out of the way when not needed. I only wish it were a little bit longer.
1,terrible product,"This product was never even used. We managed to get it tangled and jammed just in the process of setting it up, and it didn't take much to cause this to happen - I had read the caution about how easy it was to tangle. After fighting with it for a few hours we gave up. As another reviewer stated (which I should have taken as a bad omen) it would be helpful if the plastic casing would open so you could get the line unjammed. My husband called the company who won't take any action on their own. At the price it's not worth my effort to package up and return, so it went in the garbage."
4,"Darnit, I forgot!","Holy cow! I knew I'd ordered one of these things! I think I ordered two things at once...and the other thing was cool...so I shoved this under the bed and totally forgot about it! My wifes like, ""hey, weren't you going to put me up a clothes line?"". So anyway, sure enough I find this thing thanks to this ""review request"" reminding me I bought it. After Christmas I'll get this thing hung and tested and EDIT this review with some decent information. Sorry, just had to ramble a few moments. :)"
2,Doesn't last.,Live where it gets very hot in the summer and the plastic hooks have broken. Very disappointed with this product and am looking foe a better quality.
2,Not very good,"Hung this guy up and stretched the line across the yard, a distance of about 30 feet. I typically start from the outside and work my way to the middle hanging clothes. This line gave way after about 2 heavy towels and 5 shirts. Not worth buying IMO."
5,Great Product,Item arrived quickly and as described. I am using it inside. It outperforms anything else I have tried. Would recommend.
4,Happy with product,"Mattis pid ut nec sit phasellus, vel, rhoncus, a pid? Nisi, penatibus aenean vel vut, facilisis, aliquet non, adipiscing quis porta ridiculus magna, et enim turpis enim"
5,CRAWFORD-LEHIGH 40 FT. RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE,WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR A RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE. THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS WERE CORRECT.IT IS EASY TO INSTALL AND USE.I WOULD SUGGEST IF THE WASH LOAD IS HEAVY AND THE LINE IS EXTENDED TO THE MAXIMUM THAT YOU USE A CLOTHESLINE SUPPORT.YOU CAN PURCHASE ONE FORM AMAZON OR USE A BOARD.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY - Get old-fashioned clothesline rope and hooks,"I have tried every brand of these retractable clotheslines. They are all cheaply made, inferior products. The locking mechanisms don't work. The hooks are too weak and break. The inadequate, soft-cotton/poly lines coated with vinyl sag and need to be knotted again and again to restore a modicum of tautness, so that the retractable feature is rendered useless. I have the line extended a little more than 25 feet, but it is supported in the middle by a line attached to a large wooden beam. The support hasn't helped. There are materials available that would work better, but that would reduce the profit margin and the ever-on-going repeat sales. Tomorrow, I will install low-sag clothesline rope and sturdy eye bolts. Perhaps a retractable clothesline is a great idea, but the execution by every manufacturer (they all appear to be made by the same factory) is shamefully poor."
3,Functinal but blotched,"Functional and convenient but not pretty: arrived with a blotch molded into its plastic case. Postage to return the product almost equals product cost and, we figured, the next one might have the same problem, so we just kept it."
2,Bad locking mechanism,"This is a fairly well made and affordable laundry line. I'd be very pleased with it, but its line-locking mechanism is insufficient. It's designed so that you tuck the line around a little catch, but this friction hold is insufficient to suspend the weight of a normal laundry load. You put a pair of jeans on the line and the line slips and sags to the ground... every time. This design could be corrected if they were to add one or two more friction points to wrap the line around.I think I'll keep it and add some hooks myself to make up for what the product lacks. I'm hoping this will fix the problem. They really need to deal with this, because as it stands, as much as I'd like to, I could not recommend this product to anyone."
1,bad quality and very old version,The switch over to DVD is not good. There is bad camera stuff and it's all so fake looking. This DVD is too old a version. It's not as entertaining.
5,The Swiss Family Robinson(the complete series),"Maybe there are no reviews on this product because the information is confusing. It says the cast members are: Michael Duhig, Heather Graham and Diana LeBlank. If you look in the Internet Movie Database, 7 photographs show: Martin Milner(father),Pat Delaney(mother),Cameron Mitchell(castaway), Helen Hunt(Captain's daughter), Willie Ames(eldest son)and Eric Olson(younger son). During the 1980's I recorded this series from television, and have enjoyed it for many years. Since there is so little information in the advertised product, I am going to purchase the DVD series set, and will get back to you later with my findings! MaryAn"
3,"Limited selection, expiration date?","I also got three light roast, two hazelnuts, one decaf, and three different teas. I haven't tried them yet, but did notice that the date code on the bottom of the coffee boxes (if I interpret it correctly) makes me think these were packed sometime in early 2005."
3,"Good price, but it is a gamble on what you will get...","I bought two of these. Both of my sets were identical. They were in a variety pack. My contained three light roast, two hazelnuts, one decaf, and all three different teas. So while it was a good price (paid 15.00), it is a gamble. I had read a couple of the reviews and wondered what I would end up with."
1,162 variety pack,"i also didn't get what was advertised on the box. i realize that both the box and amazon tell you contents may vary, but i was still very disappointed when the three best flavors (in my opinion) were missing."
2,"Good Coffee, Good Value, False Advertising!","Received my coffee & tea variety pack. All 162 pods were there. But the assortment was not as advertised. Instead of 18 pods of each kind, I received the correct amount of teas and 2 boxes of the Hazelnut and 4 boxes of the light roast.Good value, Bad assortment! I won't be ordering from them again."
3,A nice workout - boring scene,"This tape offers good instruction and a good workout for beginners. However, the back drop is very dull and too quiet. I guess I like to see more people in the background. Stephanie is the only one in the boxing ring. There are 3 routines included, so you can do whatever suits you for the day - from light to difficult. A definite buy for low-impact exercisers."
3,Ho hum,I have been kickboxing for about 1 1/2 yrs. and bought this asone of my first tapes. It taught me the fundementals but wasincredibly boring with only 1 instuctor and very low impact pace. If your a vetern excerciser go for a more upbeat tempo tape like Kathy Smith's or Denise Austin's kickboxing.
3,"Okay, depending on what you need.","I purchased this item off of an auction. The price was right. I have a larger, analog scope but I needed something small for some FM deviation testing. This scope hooked to a simple deviation meter allowed by to confirm the deviation peaks of my radio. I would say that if you need to do a bunch of precise work, I would suggest a better scope. If you just need a working scope for a once in a blue moon project, this might fit the bill."
5,Exciting find..,"This book just so fantastic and very easy to follow. I have never come acroos this book here in the Mainland. Only when my daughter who lives in Oahi, Hawaii sent me this book as a Mother's Day gift did I learn of such crocheted Hawaiian Leis and I tell you, I started crocheting the very day I got the book and was very pleased with my finished projects... Looks just like the Leis in the pictures. Thank you... another crochet world had been opened to me."
5,"beautiful leis, great fun","If you are looking for an inexpensive craft that yields great results, this is the book for you. The projects are beautiful, and the supplies are easy to find. The leis can also easily be adapted to garlands for decorating. (I crocheted a very long lei in red and green, didn't join the ends, and wrapped it around my bannister as a Christmas decoration. Compliments abounded.)My thanks to Roberta Wong for a wonderful book!"
2,Too negative,"Eliza certainly went through tough times through her illness both because of the US centric healthcare system, the less than first class medical professionals, as well as the treatments itself. Would not recommend this book for anyone actually having Colon Cancer."
1,gay: faile FAILS!,"I wanted to rate it no stars... it might make me rate it one star>>> what a waste of money. i ordered both this and the 1320 street racing documentary, better just order the documentary (1320 street racing movie... the real shiiiit) cause this DVD sucks!!!!"
2,doesn't make thin enough slices,"As someone who cooks professionally, I can say that MAIN point of the mandoline is to get something that will slice paper thin slices - which this contraption, sadly, can't do. Instead of spending your $ on this, go ahead and get a Super Benriner - I've used a few mandolines and it's by far my favorite. This, I think, is overpriced and rather poor in execution, especially considering the price."
4,"works ok, but plastic stains","This product works fine and is easy to use, but don't expect it to be of quality construction. The blades are sharp enough to do each task of slicing,including thin slices, but since it is white plastic, it stains easily with things like carrots or beets and won't come clean. I would still recommend it over spending $200 or more for a ""restaurant type"" mandolin slicer, since it does the job well and is reasonably priced."
3,"Overall good, hand guard design is a little problematic","It's overall very good. The unit is stable and doesn't skid while slicing. It comes with a variety of blades that satisfy all of my cutting needs. My only complaint is that it is very difficult to julienne small items such as carrots due to the hand guard, which doesn't hold produce of this size very well at all."
5,"For those with poor knife skills, order this today!!!!!","The mandoline is simple to use and to change the type if cut your desire or thickness. It's easy to store and takes up very little counter/cabinet space. I purchased a mandoline from Sam's several years ago that was far more expensive than this and I used it all of about three times; it required more work to change the blades or thickness and the machine had to be flipped over. It was cumbersome and inconvenient. I wish I had this years ago.My knife skills are SUBPAR, this not only provides precision cuts but also does it efficiently. I purchased this at a cheaper price than what is show but I would have paid more given how well it works. I advise others to buy theBorner Oval Slicing Bowl - Swissmar."
4,Easy employment of device,"Smooth working item with no retardation of it's bevel. Axis and planing slices true with precision, excellent constuction providing a formidable product. I believe the only flaw becomes apparent while slicing steel wool for a garnish."
4,Swissmar Mandoline V-4000,"This Mandoline was a Christmas gift for use at home by my son-in-law, who is a professional chef. While I cannot personally review it, he seems pleased with it so far."
5,A must-have for the kitchen!,"This was one of the best food prep purchases I could have ever made! It has cut so many dishes' prep time in half, if not more! Plus, it is easy to use, easy to clean and stores neatly and with minimal space. I've been using it a few months now and the blade is still razor sharp and everything still looks brand-new. I want to buy more of these as gifts for birthdays/Christmas! I highly recommend this to anyone who is considering a slicer, mandolin, or V-slicer. It's just perfect. I prefer that it is free-standing and isn't attached to anything to catch it, because it takes up less space and requires less to clean. This is the BEST!"
1,Quality Control????????????,"It looks as if Mr. Knaak was in need of some fast cash, because this book is the worst I have yet to read by him. The plot is thin, the characters are uninspiring and, despite poor attempts at action, it does not move. What happened to quality books like Huma and The Dragon Realm series??? Thoes were truly great pieces of modern fantasy. I hope that this is not a trend Mr. Knaak. Another book like this and I will stop looking for new Knaak releases. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!!"
3,A bit sparse in the spine,"This is a helpful book, but lacks some key aspects needed in college level English classes. Example: paraphrasing is not covered. Quotes are covered extensively though. Good for the price, handy, light to carry, but could use additions."
1,not high school friendly,"I was very disappointed in this product after purchasing it for my 11th grader. The book is an ode to the authors intelligence; lots and lots of unnecessary explanations that serve no purpose. When I attempted to incorporate it into my family's home study regiment, I became frustrated with the book!!! (Yes I am college educated and degreed. This book needs to lure the student in rather than repel them."
1,Broke in less than a month on relatively light use!,"What can I say about a product that did not last 30 days of relatively light use! Well on the positive side the unit is light weight and very comfortable to use. The grip cover makes for a nice non slip surface. Unfortunately that is the only positive I can find. From day one the grip was noisy when compressed. The noise comes from the metal rods rubbing against the plastic handles. I was willing to live with that. But with very light use, one of the metal legs failed due to fatigue. As an engineer I can tell you that that is a very poor design with a very short life cycle. At the end, I guess we get what we pay for and this was a very cheap grip strengthener."
1,Cheap for a reason,"The plastic underneath the ""grip"" part on these grips is very cheap and broke a few weeks after use. If you're serious about grips and want to ACTUALLY USE them--do NOT buy these grips."
2,Harbinger hand grip,"Just got this and when i opened the box it was in it was already open from its case, all scratched up, and the logo melted onto the box; it works but its like they gave me a used one without even trying to hide the fact that its used. I had bought one before and it was good and looked brand new, but this one is bad."
3,Basic hand grip,Nothing out of the ordinary. Looks kinda cool. Feels alright in the hand. I wish it had more resistance.
3,Smelly,"I can't be too disappointed, since it was so cheap. However, the rubbery covers smell a little strange. I would recommend purchasing a Grip Master hand strengthener."
4,I like it,Smooth comfortable operator. I like it. I wish there was a tension adjustor since my left hand is not as strong as my right hand.
1,Just okay..,"This item doesn't fit comfortably into my hand,I have to hold it off center, also my fingers aren'tlong enough to wrap around it when it is fully extended.I have to use both hands to squeeze it down, then placeit into one hand to do the excersize."
2,Its ok,"This is great if you are a starter or someone just wanting to rid of some stress. It broke in a couple of weeks after I easily did 100 full reps. By then I wanted something much harder. You dont need much muscle to close this thing. 5'-10"", 180lbs. By the way my 115lb wife did 10 full reps."
1,Spring Broke After Light Use,"I love the feel and resistance of these grippers. However, I have broken the springs in three of them and will never buy them again. If you plan on using them more than a month or two, consider them disposable."
3,Ballet inspired moves,"I like all her DVDs and was eager to try this one, but I was disappointed because it was hard for me to follow her. And although I did have my sweat, I wish I didn't feel so out of sink with the steps. The DVD is an inspiration, she is wonderful, but I have a long, looong way to go before I get to move as easily as they do. If you are familiar with ballet moves, than you will probably love this workout."
1,This One Rates a Minus Ten,"This is a colossal waste of money. There is no possible way a sane human being can sit through this crashing bore of a DVD without falling asleep. Nothing happens; none of the material is presented in context; the ersatz lessons make no pedagogical sense.First, there's a voice rapid-firing the alphabet. Too bad for you if you can't follow it--especially the Russian. Then the voice moves on to present and past conjugations of ""to have"" and ""to be."" Again, tough luck if you aren't linguistically buff enough to keep up. There are no pictures. There are no conversations, no grammar explanations, no graphics, and no way to extend the lists of words and expressions into real-life situations. One hears nothing but that voice and sees nothing except that white-on-black print.Why put this blah-blah-blah on an expensive DVD? To get your money, that's why. Don't say you haven't been warned. If only the ratings allowed minus stars, this would come in at an easy minus ten."
3,"Nice art, average script...","This book begins with some bad stories, getting better around X-Treme #3.. it also features the first appearence of Lifeguard and Slipstream. If you like Claremont, you will probably enjoy it..."
5,X-Treme X-Men - one of the best out there,"If you're an X-Men fan like myself, then you'll love this backpack collection of X-Treme X-Men #1-9. Christopher Claremont and Salvadora Lacorra deliver a jam packed adventure featuring some of Marvel's most popular characters on the quest for Irene Adler (Destiny's) diaries, which predict the future of the world. IF put into the wrong hands the world is doomed. Rogue, Storm, Bishop, Thunderbird, Psylocke, Beast, Sage,Gambit, and new recruits Slipstream, Lifeguard, and Red Lotus face off against the assasin Vargas. In an around the world adventure the team travels from Spain to Australia. But what price will they pay? Will they be willing to sacrifice their own for the sake of the cause? For the sake of the dream? Join the X-Treme X-Men in a tale filled with awesome writing and beautifully detailed art work by Claremont and Lacorra. X-Treme X-Men is the one for any true X-Men fan!"
2,very average,"The story was slow and lacked edge. It makes no real move in the development of the X-Men's story, or potential. If you like general, run of the mill stories, go ahead and get this one."
2,Disappointing,"I'm very disappointd by this series. After recommendations from several quarters about how good this is, I bought this as to ""test-water"", but it turned out to be rather sour. Poor artwork (as in, REALLY POOR), and slow-paced story. Will probably capture the hearts of older X-Men fans who want something that look like the past. But with the likes of Ultimate X-Men and New X-Men out there, I find no reason to persist with this title."
3,ok,"as far as well made, this is great. unfortunately the color was not what i thought. I bought the bright blue color, and what i got was more of a sky/powder blue."
2,"Get ""Little Feat: Rockpalast Live"" instead","This St. Louis concert is not very good at all. I'm surprised that Little Feat released a show this weak on DVD. There are only brief flashes of the brilliance that a Little Feat fan would expect. I'm surprised the audience is having so much fun. The poor production and lighting result in a rinky-dink looking presentation. The camera work (or at least the way it's edited) is annoying at times. If you want to get a GREAT Little Feat DVD for your collection get ""Little Feat: Rockpalast Live"". That's the real McCoy."
3,who did this production?,"I love the Feats and I think their playing here is tight and brilliant but WHOEVER PRODUCED AND ENGINEERED this made it into a subpar concert!The video is OK not brilliant, that I can live with, but the sound quality and mixing just sucks! The Rockaplast video and sound from many years before is better, not that the band is better(leave LG out of the equation) it is a better production. I can't recommend this, which is too bad. There are very few American bands that match these guys live!! Well, hopefully something will surface from their later years that will demonstrate the greatness of the FEATS!There is some great butt rockin' here but to me maybe the best cut this version of ""Willin'"", the dvd may be worth having for that even with subpar sound. Fred Tacket plays his butt off and you can't hear him...bummer."
3,Not The Feat I Know and Love,"If you are looking for the classic high energy Feat that appears on live albums such as Waiting For Columbus or Live At Neon Park you won't find it here. This concert was setup, as Barrere explains, to be a DVD and it is far too rehearsed as a result. The music is very subdued and the over emphasis on the congas in the recording mix gives it an entirely different flow than we Feat Freaks are used to. The solos, instead of being tossed back and forth, seemingly spontaneously, are timed and measured. Shaun Murphy, normally a pretty powerful singer, looks and sounds bored for much of the show. There are shining points towards the end of the set and in the encore, and the limited amount of Little Feat available on DVD make it worth having for sure. Now if they would just fire the camera view mixer that was obviously inflicted with ADHD and do it again....."
2,What A Disappointment,"I was ALL set to kick back and watch ""The"" Little Feat that i had heard live three times over the years, and i have to say, im SO happy i did not have to pay for this effort; a friend of mine lent it to me. A band of great musicians, singers and songwriters, BUT this concert is NOT the Little Feat i once loved to hear. Its a very disjointed performance. Personally? I got quickly turned off Real Fast by the addition of the new woman vocalist, just doesnt cut it, and looks very uncomfortable on stage...They would have been a million times better off having Craig Fuller fronting the band. I could not Wait for the show to end, and would NOT recommend this concert at all. Sure hope they put out a better show on the next go around."
3,Was there,I was at this concert during the recording. Little Feat is always good. This concert was good though not exceptional.
5,Wai Lana Yoga: Easy Series,I've watched Wai Lana on TV and was very excited to get her DVD's. She is a very good yoga instructor and I love the feature on the DVD's where I can create my own flow of poses. I highly recommend this product!
1,overblown,"Too much story, too many people and way too much plot - plus some of the worse acting ever make this famous film a disaster. If you must have an Alexander Ptushko film try the much simpler and far better Scarlet Sails."
2,not Ptushko's best,"Director Alexander Ptushko goes overboard in this slow, draggy film about a legendary Ruasian hero. It is killed by a laughable dragon and as unattractive a hero as has ever appeared on film. The spectacle is there but there is too much of everything. Ptushko's best is the romantic Scarlet Sails which is far superior."
4,"Very Good, But Not Great Like Their Debut","'Lifesong' is a very good album with great lyrics. It is not as good as the self titled debut album by 'Casting Crowns'. That is not surprising, however, as the first one was incredible.This collection continues providing really meaningful and thought provoking lyrics. I don't find the songs as catchy as were the ones in their first CD. Perhaps after listening to this a few more times, that will change.One song that is very good lyrically and musically is the title cut, 'Lifesong'. I also really liked the message in the following songs particularly: Set Me Free, While You Were Sleeping, Does Anybody Hear Her, and Prodigal.Overall, this is a very enjoyable CD. I would recommend it. It might be good to not have expectations that it will be as good as the group's first effort, however."
2,Sophomore Slump,"While the lyrics are as powerful as the first album, the music is draggy, dull, and unimaginative. If I just want good ""lyrics"" I will read a book."
4,Great CD!,"This is great contemporary worship music, his melodic voice intwined with background vocals that will pull at the strings of your heart! They are great in concert too!"
5,Great CD prompt arrival,"This is a great CD. It arrived when promised - actually earlier than promised. The case was cracked but I bought it used in ""good"" condition. The CD is perfect and it was the first CD I got from an order of 3 or 4 I placed at the same time."
4,Casting worship on a needy world,Enjoy this wonder in worship with a loving crew of believers! Worth whatever the price!
5,Excellent,"This is an amazing Christian album! I'm gonna rate the songs as I find it really useful when people do when I'm thinking about buying a CD.Lifesong -good first song, loud chorus 8/10Praise you in this storm -Moving, 10/10Does anybody hear her -slow, relaxing 10/10Stained glass masquerade -faster, good harmonies 9/10Love them like jesus -Another slow song, piano intro 10/10Set me free -bit louder 7/10While you were sleeping -another quite one, mainly just piano 8/10Father, Spirt, Jesus -more lively 8/10In me -Make a good worship song 9/10Prodigal -Slow, half way through load drums come in which makes it more lively 8/10And now my Lifesong sings -A quiet one 8/10"
5,Praise in the storm,"As a victim of the flood in cedar rapids this song is the only thing that has got me through. It reminds me each time I hear it that everything I have is his, to give and take away. He is always there in the storm."
5,The best Casting Crowns album,"In my opinion, this is the best Casting Crowns album! I love Mark Hall's real and honest lyrics. The song ""Praise you in this Storm"" is by far the best song, but there are so many good songs on this album, you can't go wrong!!"
2,Let Down,"I might be jumping the gun, because I have only had the CD for 1 day, but, in that time I have listened to it several times. I was pretty dissappointed and let down from the first CD to the second. The anticipation of this CD coming out, I was thinking that Casting Crowns was going to outdo the first CD. But, to me, it wasn't even close. It seemed to me, that there were alot of filler songs on this CD. That Casting Crowns settled on several tracks. Especially the final track. I am a musician in a Praise Band and we do mostly Contemperary Christian songs. We rotate about four songs from Casting Crowns first CD. This CD will probably get the title track and that's it. Sorry for this review, but I feel that the future customers need to read this if they think that this CD is going to match the first one, which is a 5 Star rating to me."
2,Let Down,"I found the first Casting Crowns Album to be great. This album, other then the song Lifesong, is a big let down. I find the songs in this album to be a bit depressing, always with the hope of God found in them, but they are just not the powerful praise and worship that was in the first album."
3,did pretty good,"Of course my favorite songs were the title songs. But after awhile I liked the other songs, too."
2,The Rainbow- something for both camps to think about,God did send the flood but after the flood he promised He would never do this again to His people. The rainbow was the sign that He would never do it again. When you read Rev 4:3 there was a Rainbow around the throne.
4,"It was good, but the Amazon reviewer is wrong!","The Amazon reviewer is wrong, Nichole Nordeman is a fine singer, but doesn't sing on this album. Casting Crowns contains 2 female singers.Anyway, this CD is not as good as the first 6 songs on their 1st album, but this one is good most of the time."
4,A solid album,"The exceptional ""Father, Spirit, Jesus"" could easily become of a staple of praise and worship services."
5,So Good and Still So Easy,I had first picked up Sam Choy's Island Sampler and loved everything I made so I wanted more. I got this book and once again everything I have made has been delicious. Choy does a great job using few ingredients and few steps not like many cookbooks that have you using five pans and thirty different ingredients. Way to go Mr. Choy!
5,Great book !,After I bought this book I tried Sam Choy's famous roast duck. Man..oh man.. it's so easy and the taste is too die for ! I tried some more of his recipes and all of them turn out great. I hope one day I can really try his cooking ! It will be a dream comes true !
5,Good book for starting multivariate in ecology,"I found this book helps me to understand more in multivariate stat used in ecological field. Without mathematical computation, the book provides insight for properly using such stat for ecological data analysis. It's worthwhile for maltivariate newcomers for reading this good book."
2,not so great,"Great idea & small enough for easy storage but not durable. It's foam so it's thin. My 2 yr old son got a hold of one of the cushions & took a huge bite out of it. Would not recommend this. If your son/daughter is in to the putting everything in your mouth phase, he/she will easily rip this product to shreads."
3,Just Okay,"These weren't exactly what i was looking for. I was wanting ones that were more rubber, but these are just foam. They are still soft and help, but will be lookng for other soon."
5,Perfect for my 6 year old boy!,"I read mixed reviews of Hot Wheels for the Wii, but I'm glad I ignored the negative reviews. My 6 year old boy just loves the game and it provides enough challenge so his dad can enjoy racing against him. Game play is easy to pick up with the Wii remote and we've had fun unlocking different games. The one negative is that you can only unlock games in single player mode rather than two player mode.In summary, this game is great for father-son bonding!"
2,Not as little-kid friendly as hoped for,"This game is not as little-kid friendly as I was hoping for. While the cars are great and appealing for my 5-year-old son and 3 1/2-year-old twin sons, they had a hard time controlling the cars around the courses and accomplishing the goals. All three of them were frustrated trying to play it. It definitely wasn't those ""pick up and play"" games. Mario Kart is a far better choice for both little-kids and us adults, and for those looking for an easier ""pick up and play"" game."
4,Great game for the inexperienced!,"First of all, I have to say how cute this game is to play! Once you pick your car, they race all over what appears to be a little boy's bedroom. They go through the dust bunnies, through the soap suds, then under the floorboards where they have all their special races. It's just plain cute and not overly hard. Probably, should be at least 6 to play it since it does require the manueverability and reflexes. But other than that, it's not too hard but it's just right for a beginning WII player. Super cute, not too much violence (you can blow up the other cars), and not too hard. Highly recommend!"
2,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,I purchased this game for my 5 year old son and he has played it twice. It was a waste of my money as he is finding it difficult to operate the game. I would not recommend this game for the (wii).
5,Son Loves this game,"He wore out the old one, so had to buy a new one. For ages 6+. The one Wii game we have that never gets old."
3,OK - but Mario Kart much better,"This was the first racing game purchased for our 7 year-old son. He was 6 at the time we got the Hot Wheels game and we never really got into playing it. He got Mario Kart this year and we all love playing it. Hot Wheels Beat That is far inferior overall, at least for younger kids."
4,Royce Da 5'9 - M.I.C,"This is the second album that I picked up from Royce. This isn't really a solo album by him, his M.I.C group is also on a lot of the songs. Don't let that keep you from getting this though.Lyrically, Royce and the M.I.C is real on this album. Its the same old Royce you know from any other songs/albums hes been on.Production wise, this album is very good, some of the beats were decent/medicore, but most were bangers. The songs I listed in my top 5 have very dope beats.If you like Royce, then this album is for you plain and simple. Nothing weak abou it!Peace.My Top 5 Songs1.On The Road2.Dope3.Gone In 30 Seconds4.Basic5.No Talent Rappers"
3,not his best but still good,"i think royce is the sickest mc outta detoit along wit obie trice.A lot of people may not know this, but the unofficial MIC Mixtape Vol 1 was WAY better than this mixture of (MIC Vol 1) & (Death Is Certain). he switches tha style and everythin its alot betta! He cums strong and his crew do a nice job too. Highlight tracks include Buzzin', on the road, 52 bars, simon says, gone in 30 seconds, and dope. go cop dis if u a real fanpeace"
4,BANGIN',"As usual, Royce has dropped ANOTHER banger. I love this guy. I simply cannot believe Eminem dropped him from Shady Records. OH WELL......Em's problem. Royce is hotter than ANYONE Slim has released (that's including those untalent MTV whores in G-Unit). Ok, Obie Trice is nice too. Sorry Obie. Anyway....Royce is hot. I love the darkness of his lyrics. He's a very descriptive, well worded street reporter. No bull**** club music here. All true to life street stories. All the beats are bangin. I really recommend you purchase (or downlaod, whatever) ALL of Royce's albums. They're ALL good (and that's very unusual these days)."
4,Royce is back again,"Yo my boi Royce DA 5'9"" is back again with this tight album. yo the best tracks on this are ""Dope"" and ""Buzzin"" both songs are off the chain, like if the cd was based on these two songs it would get like 10 stars, but thats not the case. All the rest of the tracks are more like 4 stars but this cd is a solid by. definitley pick up this album. also my other reccomended songs on this are ""On the Road"" and ""Simon Says"". pick up this album its mad crazy and my boi Royce is just showin u why hip-hop is so popular, its b/c of the underground guys like Royce that aren't as popular but can flow better then the rest. So instead of pickin up the Game's cd or Cam'ron, pick up M.I.C the new joint by Royce DA 5'9"""
2,All Wrong,I received these CD's and all of the them were labeled wrong. That is all of play lists printed on the CD's and on the box were wrong. The CD's showed they played certain songs but played different than the ones listed. It was frustrating to try and figure out what CD had my favorite songs as I had to play each one. I returned the item.
3,Good music but faulty labeling,"The quality of the music is good. The labeling is not. The labels for CDs 2 and 3 are switched. And the box they come in is so tight you have to take it apart to remove the CDs. A small inconvenience, but otherwise a good product. I would recommend."
4,Great practice mute,This mutes tone is not the best but it is great for practicing living in an apartment while not disturbing everyone around you
2,"Muffles a little, but doesn't ""Mute"" by a long stretch","Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product. As I share a house with four other girls, it can be difficult to find a time to practice violin when it won't disturb anyone. I was very excited to find an inexpensively priced mute to dampen the sound. I installed it on the bridge of my instrument and ran the bow across the strings... and it sounded exactly the same. I pushed it on a bit tighter, (as tight as I felt I could put it without damaging my bridge) and it started to muffle the sound slightly, but still wasn't a great deal quieter. It seems to destroy tone quality (which was to be expected; it's a practice tool and not for performing) without making much of a difference in volume (which was the disappointment.) At least it was inexpensive, and I'm only out $5."
4,Much better than the tiny ones!,"This is the only thing that makes my practicing bearable, even to myself. Fits fine and comes off easily. Works well especially for people in another room."
3,This mute works...,"this mute works well. It definitely makes the instrument quieter, but also prouduces a hollow sound from the f holes on the instrument. When playing in pizzacato, it doesn't do anything at all but make it sound worse. From afar, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference with it on or off. But when near the instrument, you can hear the hollowness."
3,"A good product, just not as effective as I would want","I was so excited to receive this product, and it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I ordered a rubber mute because I didn't want to do damage to my instrument, whether it was the mute falling off and scratching the violin or damage to the bridge, and this does fulfill that requirement, however, although it significantly reduces the sound, it wasn't all that quiet with the mute on. But I suppose after only paying around 6 dollars for the mute and shipping, it is great value for money."
2,Did not mute but very little.,Total waste of money. Could not tell but little difference in the sound of my violin. And you had to be more than careful putting it on an taken it off. I put it in the 13 file.
1,Not very good quality,I bought this mute because of all the good reviews on amazon. I live in an apartment so I hoped that it would cut way down on the noise which is does not. If the violin loudness was at 100 before the mute it is about a 90 with it. Still much too loud to practice in an apartment or hotel room. This mute is inexpensive which is great because it is a total waste. If you are looking to seriously mute your violin I would recommend purchasing a different mute. This one just does not work.
4,Practice mute,"The mute is really effective, it decreases the sound without affecting the quality. The appearance is not that good as it is not uniform in color and has some rubber extrusions."
3,Not Effective,"I own a nice solid metal mute for the violin and have enjoyed it for some time. The idea of purchasing the rubber mute was from a fear that the metal one may be causing damage I could not see to the violin, and because it would be able to sit on the bridge without removing it to close the case. I have to say that after the first draw of the bow I learned how small this mute is. The reduction in sound was so negligible that I tossed it into my desk and am likely to never use it again, going back to the solid metal piece."
3,"It's okay, but look for a better quality mute","I think for the price, this makes a good mute! It's safe for your instrument and really does soften the sound of my 4/4 violin. I can just tell the difference by putting it on and off.The only issue I'm having with this mute is that when I want to play C natural on the G string, it ALWAYS stutters. I really don't understand why so. All the other strings are fine, but that one note on G string is always problematic. I wouldn't mind if I never really played that note but I constantly do for the pieces in my strings class.I don't know if it was just mine and it's faulty, but either way, I would skip this one and look for a different one. But if your looking at price, this is a good deal."
2,Mutes very little,"As many low rating reviews have indicated, this mute mutes very little. It also tends to get stuck on my bridge."
4,Great for maintaining the peace!,"We purchased this violin practice mute for our son who is just starting to play the violin. I was worried that he wouldn't be able to hear whether he was playing the right notes, but it mutes the sound just enough that he can still hear what he is playing, but it doesn't disrupt the rest of the household if he's practicing in his room with the door closed. I would definitely recommend this product. It's a small price for keeping the peace!"
5,My neighbors thank you,"New to the violin and sometimes, when busy, don't get to practice until night-time. This item works well. And BTW, some have written about having to stretch it so it fits the bridge; the mute does not have to be put on all the way down to the top of the bridge to do it's job. Just slide it on until it's secure; that reduces the vibrations and turns the volume down."
4,"It works, to a degree","We live in an apartment, so my husband decided he needed a mute in order to play his violin at night. This mute does work, to a degree. I mean, it doesn't completely mute the sound, but it does the job well enough so that when I'm sleeping in the next room, his playing doesn't wake me up. All in all, it is a good mute for the money you spend on it. If you're looking for something immensely quiet, I'd go with a higher end one, but this one works well for what we need it for."
1,Doesn't work,"Not worth the money. Don't even bother. It doesn't mute a thing, and I even made sure my daughter was using it right. Very disappointed in this product."
3,blagablkjvjnqwoi,I don't know anything about this product im just bored and typing reviews into stuff i bought! Horses make glue!
4,A Good Value,"This mute does what it is supposed to do, reduce the volume of the instrument, and it was reasonably priced."
3,From novice user,This works but it is not working as I expected. Need to give attention to know that the mute is on the violin.
5,Great Mute at a bargain price,"I purchased this mute to allow me to practice violin in my dorm without disturbing those around me. It does a really great job. I have a mute that I've used in pieces before, but this makes the violin much quieter. Hopefully it fits my viola also."
5,does what you need it to do,This is a rubber sound damping object that fits snugly over your violin bridge. It still produces sound adequate to practice with. Great for late night/early morning practicing. Note that the tone and volume of your instrument is greatly reduced so you still need to practice without the mute to work on your tone and dynamic range.This particular mute seems good quality and durable so far.Obviously not suitable for anyone with a latex allergy.
2,A Disappointement,Destroys the tone but doesn't do much muting in the process. I suspect that a metal mute would work better.
5,Great Product,It's an excellent practice mute. I can't imagine muffling the sound any more that this one does and still be able to hear the nuances of your playing. I'm glad I didn't purchase any those heavy brass mutes that can potentially damage the bridge.
3,"Reduces sound some, but not enough","The mute fits well, and is light. It fits in the case well without needing to be removed from the violin, too. However, it only reduces sounds maybe 30% or so. While the mute doesn't interfere with the quality of sound from the violin, a plus, it doesn't reduce the sound enough to be played in our apartment at night, though we will continue to use it during to the day."
5,It works,It mutes the sound by half and you can still hear the tone. Everyone in the household appreciates that I bought this.
1,Terrible!,"Not even Colin Firth could redeem this movie. It has to be one of the worst I have seen in a long time. I had been looking for a copy for a long time to add to my Colin Firth collection, but I wish it had stayed in obscurity known as ""Londinium."" The title has been changed, perhaps to attract more viewers.I could tell from the beginning that it was going to be bad. Even the music got on my nerves. All you need to know is that the couples swap spouses, not necessarily ending up ""happily ever after."" Please avoid this movie!"
1,What a waste!,"Not even Colin Firth can save this turkey. But he's the best thing in it. Bad writing, directing, acting, not worth the time to watch. Was this written as somebody's high school project? I expect they probably changed the title from the original ""Londonium"" so that viewers would think this is a new flick."
2,"Nice broom,weak pivot lock.","This is a nice broom with a good quality head and handle. The bristles are stiff and durable. I love pretty much everything Fiskars produces. This broom however,because of the weak pivot lock, gets a weak rating.. If sweeping with any force, the head will shift making this broom not useable in the position you've chosen.Perhaps I have a defective model. I don't know.I've not seen these anywhere except here at Amazon.I'd exchange this one if I could.If the other had the same problem.I'd return it for sure."
5,"Magic Eye III, Volume 3","Magic Eye is great - if your mind can decipher this type of illusion, know that you are in the distinct minority. Studies are being conducted on whether or not extensive viewing of these illusions can actually improve your eyesight."
5,Good Results with a Red Tint,"I have been using Nature's Gate Shampoos and Conditioners for many years. In particular, I have used Henna Shampoo, Henna Conditioner, Jojaba Shampoo, and Tea Tree Conditioner. I have found all of them to perform very well. I like the Henna products very much. They add a reddish tint to my brown hair. However, I alternate with the other products for variety, and to keep the red tint in control.Now there are 2 ounce bottles available for air travel, as well as the 18 ounce size. These shampoos and conditioners are sold on Amazon and other web sites by a variety of vendors. Prices for the products and for shipping vary in time and with the vendor. I suggest doing a search to find the lowest price."
1,Enigmatic Mute,"I have had one of these mutes for many years, and I have never been able to figure out how to use it. I opted for the little Butterfly mute that slides up the strings between the bridge and the tailpiece."
3,Premium product but the shelf-sale expiration is 1/08,"I work in a health food store and like to know about skin supplements especially. This formulation is high quality and expensively packaged. I am personally not concerned about the recommended sell-by date making me sick or anything and I have not taken it long enough to evaluate whether it helps my rejuvenation schemes or not. The shipping was fast and my only issue is that I wish I had known before purchase that it is technically and expired product. As cheap as it is, it is basically worthless commericially and I probably would not have bought it since I can get fresh product with a similar but not identical primary active ingredient at a discount anyway."
5,This CD has really grown on me since my previous review.,"I may have given this CD only three stars because of what I thought were odd interpretations of songs from ""Breaking Glass"", but as will sometimes happen, this CD has grown on me with repeated listenings. The powerful performances of Hazel's own material, an Irish song, and a cover of a Stranglers tune (I am not familiar with the Stranglers) in what must have been a small, smoke-filled bar add up to one great live album. I've been focusing not just on Hazel's unique voice, but also on the fantastic instrumentals backing her up, notably the violin. Order this CD (I've never seen it in a store)."
3,Good live album with some odd interpretations.,"If you like Hazel O'Connor already, then you will surely like her live. If you're not familiar with her, then you should probably listen to ""Breaking Glass"" first. Overall, this is a good live album with some odd interpretations of Ms. O'Connor's ""Breaking Glass"" material: It's strange to have a melancholy song like ""Calls the Tune"" end with a calypso section added on, and ""Black Man"" sounds very different and is not as biting performed in a reggae style. But remember: this is a live album, and the purpose of a concert is to give the audience a good time. Ms. O'Connor certainly does that, and if you want to hear the original versions as they were, get out your ""Breaking Glass"" CD."
5,"Wonderful trumpet, superb backing","Peter Ecklund: Strings Attached is a magnificent collection of songs by an expressive trumpeter. He does the theme melodically, then variations with care. His supporting cast(s), several different groupings, provide solid background, as well as solos harmonious in spirit with the lead trumpet. 9 of the 16 selections were composed by Peter Ecklund, wonderful new melodies and harmonic progressions are to be enjoyed. Recording is excellent. Worth slipping into the CD player to re-enjoy for month after month."

2,not compatable with windows ME,This is a very old software game looks like DOS. Good structure for its day but very outdated. requires the user to run vidio in slow modes & 256 color. will work well on windows 95 & 98 machines. it does work on xp with some special setup. will not work on auto play however.
3,Right Versus Left,"Vandana is an entertaining writer. She is passionate about injustice. Shiva is a welcome antidote to the rantings of right wing ratbags from noisy think-tanks.A chapter of Shiva contrasted with a chapter of anyone from the Cato Institue, makes for an entertaining exercise in contrasting views of how our world should work.One does not have to agree with all she believes to enjoy her writing or to learn from it."
1,total garbage,The author obviously doesn't have the slightest understanding of the basis of economics.
2,TASTES DISGUSTING,"i do take a bunch of ""greens' and health products but this one i could not bear the taste. it does work but you can find other products that tastes much better. i do love this company and their products in general but they should try to do something about the taste. i couldn't even finish the bottle and threw out half of it."
1,"The ""vision"" was obviously lacking a bit",I'm sure this book will be a bestseller now. It's sad how the church has fallen in the past year or so.
2,Silicon Cell Phone Case,I was not happy with this item. It attracted every piece of dust or dirt it came in contact with. It also felt like jelly when I held it. the only good thing I can say about this item was the color. The purple was a nice shade.
2,You can find this info online for free,"The first way to spend a very small amount on your wedding is to NOT buy kitchy books like this promising to give you priceless tips.You can find all the tips in this book online. And it essentially sums up to be, ""Invite less people, get married in the Mid-West and only have coffee and cake.""Not much help to this Jersey Girl who has 80 immediate family members and a fiance with even more!But if you prefer books to the internet, then it's a good buy."
4,Critic,"It would be much more useful if the examples were more analytical.Some ""advanced"" techniques (e.g. EHLLAPI , Message Object ,Master Detail Datawindows , Multi Table Updates , MDI Interface ,DynamicDatawindows etc.) should be covered in depth with ""like a manual"" examples."
5,One of the five best bridge books to be shipwrecked with...,"This comprehensive work on overcalls actually transcends the subject and gets near to the inner essence of bridge, as few other books do (Kelsey and Ottlik's Adventures in Card Play is another). The principles of what makes a good overcall vs bad ones are laid out in clear and linear fashion, such that the information can be put to IMMEDIATE use by the reader. Your game cannot fail to improve. Best of all, the author does not gild his ideas with contrived example hands constructed only to validate them. He honestly presents each recommendation in its best and worst light. Please buy this book! (and read it twice)."
5,Deep and detailed,"First the downside: Its a bit of work going through this book. This is not some light read, with lots of jokes. Expect to spend a lot of time thinking aabout whats going on given a bidding sequence, and your hand. You want to improve? You have to work at it!The upside: This will really help you to understand not just overcalls, but hand evaluation, bidding, opening leads, defense, and what in general is going on. Who holds what, etc.Its a study of whats going on in all 4 players hands, given the information of a single bid, or one round of bidding. Why, with the exact same hand, you can overcall with one sequence, and pass with the other. I spent a few weeks reading this, going over the hundreds of sequences and hands. I'm now more aware of certain lurking dangers, and what to look out for."
3,RCA Cassette Recorder,I hoped for better music recordingThe power on the take up reels is unevenHas a low sensitivity to volumeProbably a more expensive one wouldwork better for recording music.
1,Don't buy this recorder,If you need a recorder for meetings or lectures do not buy this. It does not even record for 45 min. Half of the time it doesn't work and to record a whole tape you have to change the batteries after each use. Invest a little more money and buy a decent recorder this one is not reliable. Has failed for me on several meetings where I really needed the info. being discussed
5,Awesome texture and taste- Gluten Free!!!,It is hard to tell the difference between regular noodles and these gluten free ones. They are AWESOME! My whole family loves them.
5,Outstanding gluten free pasts,"This gluten free pasta is incredible. I enjoy the energy efficient way you can choose to make it; Boil the water, toss in the pasta then bring pot to a boil again, stir the pasta then turn the heat off and cover. In 20 minutes drain and rinse quickly and put on your sauce. Everyone in our family loves this and only one of us are gluten intolerant! ...also the Amazon prices blow away my local grocery store's price! Try these you will not be sorry."
5,next best thing to sliced bread,I love these brown rice noodles. The tinkyada brand doesn't stick like the others. My cholesterol has diminished since switching from regular noodles.
2,Warning for teeth,"This product does work well for sores in the mouth; however, I often get sores from accidentally biting my mouth, as my teeth are not arranged well. Placing this product where it sticks against a tooth causes demineralization, discoloration, and damage to the tooth. I have three teeth that became grainy, sensitive, and discolored after using this product. I suspect the citric acid in the product is at fault. That particular sore I was treating was so bad it left a scar in my mouth; but, I'm not sure healing it was worth the damage done to my teeth."
4,Difficult to apply but well worth the pain!,"Yes, I agree that its difficult to apply (especially the ones in the creases of your mouth). The trick is to pat dry the canker sore with a tissue, apply the patch and then hold it there for a good 5 minutes until it completely adheres itself onto the sore; it should feel some what ""jelly"" when you touch it. I was frustrated at first when I got a canker between my gums and cheek but this technique has helped me a lot.To get rid of the blob just drink hot tea or eat a meal and it should dissolve by itself within the next couple hours. It does sting quite a bit for the first 1 hour, but its followed by 24 hours of soothing relief! I could see my canker sore healing within 24 hours of application and it healed completely after 3 days. Yes, its expensive, but its the only thing other than getting it cauterized that really works!"
1,"Maybe for something on your lips, but not your inner cheek","I followed the directions very closely. I got my mouth as dry as possible and then held the tablet in place for 20+ seconds. As soon as I removed my fingers and relaxed my mouth the reverse side of the tablet stuck to my gums and pulled away from my canker sore. I tried again the next day and hed the tablet in place for two minutes to see if it would adhere to the canker sore. It did, but the second i relaxed my mouth it would attach to my gums. I kept my inner mouth from touching my gums for a full 20 minutes by blowing air out of my mouth, to no avail. Perhaps it might stay attached to a canker sore positioned across from your teeth, but it simply can't resist your gums. THe result is that it sticks to your gums instead of your canker sore. This must me 1.0 version of the product. If they can engineer the backside of the tablet so that it doesn't grab onto your gums perhaps they will have a good product."
2,Actually made pain worse!,"Canker Covers are a great idea in theory but fall short in practice. Here's why:1. They're too thick. If applied between the lips and the gums, they cause the lips to snag, making it hard to talk or even smile. When wedged between the lips and gum, this thickness puts pressure on the sore.2. They're too dry. Even though they dissolve in time, it still feels like the interface between the canker and the cover is irritatingly dry. Ouch!3. Menthol is an unpleasant sensation. It seems to ""perk up"" my nerves, which is not a good thing in a wound. I want to numb them!While the covers rid of the periodic, radiating pain of the sores, for me they replaced it with something worse: a steadier, more intense pain.Because of these problems, I've not been able to test the manufacturer's claim that they speed healing."
3,Learn from my mistake...Don't remove it!!!!!!!!!!,"They should really put in big, bold letters DO NOT REMOVE the patch before it dissolves. I placed a cover on my sore before I went to sleep expecting it to be gone by the time I woke up...Nope. I had a presentation that day and didn't want to talk with this goopy, slimy spot in my mouth so I decided to take it off. BIG MISTAKE. Not only did I take off the cover, I took off all surrounding skin as well which left my mouth irritated and throbbing - not to mention my poor baby canker sore got bigger and redder. Now I have a big loose piece of dead skin flapping around in my mouth where the cover was.I had used this product before, and it DOES work - just don't try to take it out before it's completely. You'll do more harm than good."
4,Best You Can Do To Cope,"It doesn't cure it or make it go away faster in my experience. But it does what it says...cover it. It's amazing enough that it sticks. The pressure still hurts when something touches it but it makes it less miserable. The patch stays on well and spreads out to cover a pretty big sore. When you have one that hurts so badly you can't even think, this is the way to go."
2,Got gyped,The produce was slippery in the mouth and hard to keep in place. But the thing that upset me the most was that instead of getting six patches..there were only five with a sealed spot where the one patch should have been and no way to complain about it to amazon.
4,Preferable,"I tried the canker patch a few months ago and found it to be very effective. I know it hurts when you first put it on, but that's how you know that it's working. The gel sticks for a long long time and it makes having the sore more bearable. I don't have to dread eating or talking. I tried the Cankermelts that come in an 18-pack, but they're just mediocre at best compared to this brand. There's that weird filmy gel stuff, yes, but it COMPLETELY covers the sore. I always worry that the patch will fall off when I'm eating or sleeping, but that never has happened to me. I find this to be the best in canker sore relief because it shields the sore from further irritation. The only way it could be better was if it wasn't so gooey and weird once it was time to come off."
3,Decent in the right circumstances,"This thing can be helpful but it's hard to get it to adhere to some areas of you mouth or tongue. And, it's like you have to be a member of Cirque de Soleil to contort and balance the little dot on your finger and reach any area that isn't right up close to your lips. But, if you can manage it, it will help keep some of the painful irritants off the sore."
2,"Covers, but didn't heal","I bought this hoping it would help heal my canker quicker. My experience was that it does a good job to cover the canker so you could eat whatever you want. Now this also depends on where the canker is because the gel melts out and covers a large area. It would not really work if you have one on the gumline around the teeth. Mine was in the corner by my gums and it could hide back there. As far as healing it did nothing at all, the canker developed as usually and lasted the normal amount of time. I tried to catch it earlier and used 2 covers but it didn't help."
1,They come off and are worthless,"I tried these for two sores on my tongue, the came off after a few minutes, and did not help the problem (probably because they were in the trash--don't waste valuable money."
5,Help at Last for Canker Sores,"Canker Covers are messy, and they do need to be available in different sizes. However, the pros far outweigh the cons. I have had great success with this product. I put one tablet on my sore before I go to bed at night. By morning most of the tablet has dissolved, the pain is almost gone, and the sore disappears within a couple of days.This has been a life saver for me!!"
1,Covers but does not heal,"I tried this out (along with the competing CankerMelts product) and was pretty disappointed in this one. They do cover the sores, but the cover is big and bulky.And they do take the pain away, at least while the cover is on. But once the cover wears off (a couple of hours or so), the sore is right back where it was. It's my understanding that the Canker Cover product has a anesthetic in it that numbs the sore, but nothing that actually helps it heal. In any case, that was my experience with them. A couple of hours of pain relief, but the sore didn't actually heal any faster.On the other hand, I found extremely good results with the CankerMelts product, especially if I wore them overnight while I slept, so they had time to work.YMMV and maybe these do work for some, but they didn't do much for me."
3,pros and cons,"Pro:-- Really does relieve pain-- Sticks to the canker store immediately and stays put-- No unpleasant tasteCon:-- Lasts maybe 2 hours, not the 8-12 claimed on the package-- I've used six patches today, the package says 'one patch fully treats most sores'-- Six tablets cost about $10 -- if this keeps up, this will turn into a very expensive canker sore"
2,Not really that great,"It's hard to get on especially if it's on your tongue. And it does stay on but eating makes it come loose. Great concept, poor execution. Back to the drawing board, guys."
1,Makes one sore into two!!!,"There aren't many positives to give about this product, except that it does provide pain relief. But here are the negatives:* The patches are thick, like an old aspirin tablet* The patch can and will stick to your teeth* Both times I tried this product, my canker sore multiplied into two!* While it does create a clear gel patch after a while, it's just too thick.The best products I have tried for canker sores are Canker Melts and Rincinol. They're not perfect by any means, but much better than this product. I also switched to SLS free toothpastes (Burt's Bees and Pronamel) and have had far fewer canker sores."
3,Good Only For Some,"These are good for canker sores on the gums, but not on the cheeks or lips where teeth touch them with their crowns. Otherwise, they're great!"
4,The best I've found,"I agree with most of the comments thus far. The product IS great for releaving pain and healing the cold sores, but it does create gross goo and it is hard to talk and eat with on (that's why it's best to wear at night). I read that someone says that it hurts worse than the sore itself, but to me the creams and gels are what hurt. I buy this at wal-greens but it is 10 dollars for 6 patches. I use another product first and save these patches for canker sores that will not go away. If they were resonably priced I would only use the patches- I love them!"
4,going well so far!,"Length:: 2:37 MinsHi Folks! This is my first video review ever. I too am a canker sore sufferer and I hate having to deal with it, here's my takeaway on the product. Thanks for viewing!"
5,A Godsend,"This product is truly a Godsend if you have a whopper of a canker sore (or even a tiny one)! I had the biggest one ever on the side of my tongue after biting it and the pain was unbearable. I found this product and even though it does take about 30 minutes to dissolve, and it does stick to your teeth a bit at first, I was able to eat, drink, and talk without much difficulty. I wore it overnight and the sore was half the size in the morning. The product does not have any type of healing medicine on it but b/c the sore is protected from food/drink/and friction, it has time to heal. I recommend this product to anyone who has even the smallest sore! The only downside I have noticed is that after it sticks to your teeth for awhile (say during the night) you may have a strange feeling on your teeth...kind of like you ate too many sweet tarts or sour patch kids :)"
2,Not for soreson the tongue,"The first time I tried it, it worked really well. I had a sore on my inner lip and it gave a lot of relief. But I often get sores on my tongue too. It just doesnt stay put on the sore. In 5-10 min after applying, the patch comes off."
1,Snakeoil at its finest,"Completely worthless. Although the box boasts ""Fast Treatment"", the active ingredient is Menthol. That's it.Didn't do anything for the sore and made it look like I was incessantly dipping. Don't waste your money on it."
2,How do you dry a salivating tounge?? Kind of difficult to use!!,"Well I read the great review and was eager to try using these Canker Covers. I rushed out on my 30 min lunch break to my local CVS and have so far gone through 4 of the 6 tablets that you get for $10.00 a package. If your canker sore is on the side of your tongue, (where a lot of us get them from biting) then forget about using it there. It was unfortunately a waste of money in my case because they stick much better to your finger than they do the inside of your moist mouth. Dry your mouth first?? How the heck do you do that while staring at yourself in the mirror drooling down the side of your face! No the easiest task to do. I'm sure they work well if the affected area was easier to reach. Unfortunately, my best hope is to rinse regularly with a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. Basically, back to enduring cankers for 2 weeks at a time. Fun. I want my $10.00 back."
1,Created more problems than it solved,"I purchased Canker Cover 3 months ago. I had a canker sore inside my lower lip, and it had been there for 4 days prior to treatment. I put the cover on the sore and followed the directions. After the patch dissolved (about 10 hours), the tooth that was opposite the sore became extremely sensitive. I could not eat anything hot, cold or sweet on that side of my mouth. It became so bad that I had to go to the dentist and have a special solution put on to ease the pain. This procedure worked for about 4 weeks and then I had to have it repeated again because the sensitivity came back. Though the pain is now more manageable, I still cannot eat certain foods on the affected side of my mouth. I have to use sensitive toothpaste both to brush and to treat the affected area. It has been quite a hassle and very painful. There is no way I would recommend this product. The tooth pain was unlike anything I had experienced before."
2,Forms a tumor like lump in your mouth....,"This is a great idea in theory, a little patch to just cover the sore spot, but in reality these are just so thick that they don't work well in most parts of the mouth. It is very difficult to speak or act normally with a 1/16"" patch adhered to the side of your tongue or inside of a lip. I find that they get knocked off by my teeth, and they make it look like I have a growth inside my mouth if I put it inside my bottom lip. They need to try to make them a bit thinner to be a five star rating. For the price, they just aren't worth it unless you have a very inconspicuous area and you aren't going to interacting with others while wearing them."
1,The cure is worse than the deasease!,"This is buncum, it created a huge burn like scar on my lip and the sensation was just horrible, much worse than the ulcer itself...they are in the trash can now!"
1,Doesn't Work,"This product doesn't work. It doesn't numb as well as other products. The tablets stick to everything except the sore even if you follow the instruction exactly. I tried several tabs and they ended up sticking partially, sticking to my teeth, sticking to my gums but not to the sore. Additionally, they appear to be too thick even if they did stick. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Sticks to my teeth too!,"Pros: Very good at relieving the pain, sticks well. The minty flavor is refreshing. It is easy to put on and just the right size.Cons: Sticks to your teeth as well if your sore is near the teeth. The first time I tried, I kept my mouth closed and waited 30 minutes for it to set. When I tried to open my mouth to see how it looked, it was stuck to my sore on one side and my tooth on the other. I tried to gently pull it off, but within the hour it came off. The other con is that depending on where your sore is, it can make your lip appear very bulky. It says that the patch spreads out, and it does, but it is still extremely thick, which is very noticeable and annoying. Because of the thickness it makes it very hard to eat or drink, so hopefully your sore is somewhere more convenient.They are also a bit expensive, I got mine for $10 and they only come six to a pack."
1,Worked when it stayed on,"I have an awful canker sore on my top lip, I had been hoping to find CankerMelts but this was all my local Walgreens had. I decided to give it a shot, since I really needed some relief.This stuff is awful. It does sooth the sore when it's actually covering it. But it doesn't stay in place (though it bonds terrifically with teeth), it makes your mouth a sticky mess and it tastes terrible. I tried twice, once using the full tablet and once using the half tablet, and both times the stuff bonded to my teeth and ripped off the sore when I moved my mouth. I just pulled the second dose out, I'll be better off without it.Simply awful, I will never buy again."
1,Cheap shirt!!! Don't make the mistake I did!,This shirt is made in Pakistan....it came in very wrinkled and those wrinkles never gone away! I gave away this shirt...I simply hated it and wish I never bought it! Leather is very cheap quality.
2,Maglox antacid,Maglox is a generic version of Maalox. Maglox works fine it gets rid of heartburn. It is suppose to be mint flavored but I can't taste the mint! To the point it is the nastiest tasting stuff and the after taste lasts forever!!! I bought 12 of them only opened one of them. I have no idea what to do with the rest it would cost to much to ship it back!
5,A great musical that should be revived in 2008 with Nathan Lane.,"I was fortunate to be part of a New Jersey theatre production in 1970 of ""Fiorello!"" I had loved the recording of the Original, Pulitizer-prize-winning production. It just must be done again."
3,Awesome watch!!.....no manufacturer's warranty.,"I love the watch! It is beautiful, functional, high quality, perfect for any active woman. My husband got if for me as a birthday gift and it was such a great surprise. The only one downfall is that the two year manufacturer warranty is void since Amazon is not an authorized reseller for the watch. However, this is not necessarily a deal breaker since Amazon offers their own two year warranty that covers the watch's movement mechanism. You can read the details of the warranty at: http://www.amazon.com/2-Year-Limited-Watch-Warranty-Watches/b/ref=amb_link_83443411_2?ie=UTF8&node;=678277011&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=special-offers-1&pf;_rd_r=018F4NYFT3F0VMCV15FR&pf;_rd_t=201&pf;_rd_p=477553831&pf;_rd_i=B000E48PH2For me this is enough and I would highly recommend this watch. I absolutely love it!"
5,Very classy....,"I bought this as a surprise gift to my wife for her last birthday. She loves it and wears it all the time. Great price, the local jeweler can not believe what I paid for this timepiece. I will buy my next timepiece from Amazon directly."
4,Holiday of Ballet,"As long as you know beforehand that you won't be seeing very many complete variations or pas de deux, this video won't disappoint. It was not made to introduce you to classical ballet, but to the stars of tomorrow (from the viewpoint of 1981), which it does very well. Nina Ananiashvili, Andris Liepa, Amanda McKerrow, and Irek Mukhamedov are just a few of the dancers on the tape that, then, were just starting out and now are famous the world over."
2,Good and Bad,"I sealed cracks in my cedar siding with DAP polyurethane sealant and it holds up well but it has a major problem. The tube says its paintable so after a month of the sealant drying I started to paint. After priming and giving boards a finish coat, the sealant is causing a shading reaction in the paint. A year later I have primed again, with oil primer and another finish coat of acrylic latex. Only where there is Dap sealant underneath the paint does a shading difference show up again. It now seems after following all these attempts at fixing this problem the only idea I have is to replace the boards as this caulk really holds and trying to remove it will ruin rough texture finish on cedar. This Dap sealant is paintable but has altered noticeably the paint finsh enough to make it unacceptable. Going back to using acrylic sealants again where there were no paint finish problems."
2,pretty crappy..,"Yah, this thing is a fair challenge to put together and it looks really nice when it's finished but the launches really suck. It never flies straight up. It always flies to one side or another and the glider just tumbles to the ground. If it detaches from the main booster at all. It should be called a tumbler instead of a glider. The fact that the launch stinks like month old milk greatly takes away from all the hard work put into it's construction. I'm ticked off I wasted a portion of my life putting this thing together. It could be that I just don't have the model assembly know how to get this thing flying rite. but I don't believe that this is the case. all and all I think this thing is junk but ever one will see thing differently. you might love it. But as for me.... I Gives it two thumbs way the hell down...."
4,The Challenge of a Skill Level Four Rocket Kit,"Skill Level Four rocket kits are supposed to be challenging to build and fly. I think this one is clearly for an experienced builder. There are two full 11x17 sheets of well illustrated assembly instructions. Read them all the way through first - if you don't you'll regret it later... I've built two now as there were a few things I didn't get quite right on my first attempt (I'm a perfectionist). Just as with any glide recovery model, you've got to hand trim the glider by hand-tossing it first. Flying it on the long burn Quest C6 engines was a cool experience. Hey, this kit is not for beginners, but Quest did grade it as a skill level four. It's a good product!"
1,"Looks Cool, but Terrible to Fly","This model looks very cool, but it ends there. VERY unpredictable when launching - has a major tendency to curl left or right. The shuttle glider portion falls like a rock. I tried adjusting it per the instructions, but it still feel like a rock. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"
4,book in good shape,"The book was in good shape, my great uncle had several pictures in there. Cost reasonable, easy to read, received the book in a short amount of time."
4,I'm a fan,"The fan is well constructed and has a vary large and strong mounting clip. The motor does make more noise than it should while spinning, but it's a small issue."
4,works pretty well,"I got it for when I go to the gym, I sweat alotand really need a fan to keep me going.The clip is large and sturdy, it swivels to manyangles, and the fan power is sufficient. So farso good."
2,Stopped oscillating,I used this fan about 12 hours per day for about 6 months before the oscillating mechanism broke.
4,Great Aquarium cooler,Keeps the thermometer on my nano reef in the green. Its cheaper than the solutions offered by aquarium suppliers too.
3,Had to buy two fans.,"I bought two fans. The first fan I bought I sent to a soldier in Iraq. He asked fo a small oscillating fan, it's 115 degrees in Iraq. I don't know what happened but after a couple of weeks he asked for a second fan, the first one broke. I didn't have time to shop around so I purchased a second fan. I guess that one is working OK, he hasn't commented on it."
4,Not much to add : ),"Great fan for the price, all the previous reviews pretty much cover it, but I though I'd add that the ""neck"" is multi-segmented which makes it easy to get this fan to point/oscillate anywhere you want it regardless of what its clamped to."
4,Osilllating Clip Fan,"It was bigger than I thought. The cord is long enough for me. The Clip is very sturdy and can grip a thick surface. The two speeds are handy. However, it has lighter output than expected. I like the adjustable angles it can make. I have no regrets buying this fan."
1,A piece of JUNK!!! NO STARS!!,"The button on the fan that makes the fan head turn BROKE the same day I took it out of the box. The fan head will almost turn to the left but just before it is susppose to start back it gets stuck and makes a clicking noise. The fan's highest speed setting is not as high as I thought it would be, with the lowest speed setting I can barely feel it."
1,Doesn't work well,The low speed stopped working a short while after I bought it--so it's either high speed or nothing. And then the side-to-side adjustment (if not in oscillating mode) gets stuck a lot and won't allow adjustment. This is just not a quality piece of merchandise.
2,Bulky and Unimpressive,"If you're looking for a fan which can really move some air, this is not your fan. My $9 6-inch fan from Walmart blows more air. Additionally, this thing is heavy for it's size and takes up a lot of room when considering how little air it moves. One of the very few good features is that it seems to be really sturdy and well built and not made from cheap materials. It's also quite versatile, you can turn and bend the fan to blow in just about any direction. But the negatives severely outweigh the positives so move on and look for another fan."
2,not enough breeze,"I wasn't satisfied with this fan. I thought the oscillation would be a good plus, but the breeze it produces just isn't strong enough. I returned it and bought the Holmes HACP7W 7-Inch Clip-On Personal Fan which I'm very happy with."
1,Holmes crap fan,"This fan was bought to use as a clip fan, however, one thing became clear upon using the fan... it sucks. When turned on, the fan did not spin. I took the cover off and turned it on again, after much spinning, the fan began to spin on it's own, but very slowly. It definitely won't move enough air to make a difference.DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE FANS!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
2,Poor air movement,"The other reviews are correct,except they fail to mention that the fan does not move air.That is why it is so quite.I do suppose that I got 13 dollars worth of fan though.Think twice about purchasing this fan."
3,"Nice, Until It Broke","This was a great fan. It cliped onto anything and supplied a great cooling breeze. I bought the small white one for some of my co-workers in a local resturaunt kitchen. But the dishwashers were wreckless with it, and oh yeah, they busted the hell out of it. I got mad and told them you have to be careful with that stuff. They did the same thing to a larger Windmere fan I gave to them last summer. They said the blade broke off and smoke came out of the back of it. Yeah Right. I've owned many of fans and that's never happened to me. People just need to know that you have to be careful with fans. They're very delicate and you can get hurt."
5,A good guide to start with & as reference for your practice,"This guide takes you from the begining of the electrocardiac cycle to the end, and throws you all the curves on the way. An excellant guide for the beginner, as I was when I first used it, and for my practice as an ICU RN. I keep it with me and refer to it often."
5,Guide to ECG,This is a great book. It has been so helpful in education of staff at my facility and assisting me in presentations. Very easily understood.
2,"Yawn, Yawn, Yawn...","A portrait of one of the United States' greatest presidents is not only a study of the politics of his administration, but the human himself. This book goes on about his qualities and how he acts. The book outlines a lot about some of the events that took place while he was in office. And I, having not been alive during his rule, found it very boring. I have no idea about half the things they talk about in the book. That is why my opinion may be debatable as others may have more of a background concerning these events. This book was written before he was assassinated. ""Portrait of a President"" really outlines Kennedy and what he was like, every single detail. If you want to read up about past events, read this book. If you want to read about who he truly was, read this book. If you want to take a nap, read this book."
2,Uninspiring Biography,"Very bland bio. To me, it is like a hearsay recounting of things with the author having a man-crush on Jefferson."
1,A very biased view of Jefferson.,I could not finish the book as it was so biased and not sticking to the facts of who and what Jefferson represented. Trying to show that Jefferson adapted many views of his liberal college professor does not reflect his future conservative policies. Jefferson is the original Republican and his constant debate over the strength of the central government and many other issues with the liberal elitist Adams is very well known.I would not recommend this book.
2,Way too stiff for me,Pillows are just OK. Way too stiff. Thought they would be more comfortable. They work good if you need a pillow for your legs.
1,Review,"It can't be said that this is a particularly good Innes. Although light-hearted and amusing enough, it is very badly plotted. The fte setting is well-drawn enough, but the rest of the plot just sags. Plot? There is nothing that can be described as a plot. (...)Nothing is done with the sheiks, apart from the problem (...)When murder does occur, this by archery(...)it is explained in one paragraph, the book then turning into an attempt to smuggle the Emir out of a house surrounded by an unfriendly crowd. Attempts to involve (...) by centring the book's feeble plot around a financial crisis involving Middle Eastern Oil (...) do not improve the book at all. In short, bad and shallow. Like all late Innes, to be avoided by the connoisseur."
5,An outstanding contribution to Black biographical history.,"Black Judas provides the first biography of William Hannibal Thomas, who betrayed his race by writing The American Negro, an insulting attack on Afro-Americans. Black Judas examines the roots of Thomas' thinking and his transformation from an optimistic black nationalist to a man who attacked his race. The detail and in-depth coverage is invaluable."
4,"Scary, But...","I need to begin by saying Baby Dolly is indeed a scary book, one that I enjoyed reading, and the characters were endearing. However, it was riddled with continuity errors. At one point it states that the baby was born in May, then later it states the baby's birthday as April fifteenth. The baby was supposed to have eyes like her father, Harold, ""eyes like the coal in the basement bin"", but later were described as being brownish-blue. The name of Sybil Wilfred's mother was given to be Alvia in the beginning, but then changed to Minerva later on. At one point Sybil's married age was 22, but then it too changed. Birth dates did not always correlate to the proper ages, and so on. It has been a while since I read the book but these kinds of mistakes stay with me as I am a critical reader. I actually read the book to tatters. By the time it finally fell apart, it was long out of print and I really am not interested in buying another, but I wanted to share my opinion on it."
2,Not so great,I didn't find that it worked very well. The weight bars slide up slowly and the resistance weakens so you have to constantly re-adjust it. The highest weight is also relatively easy to outgrow right from the beginning. I bought it and now have to buy another one...
4,Great for beginners.,"I bought this hand grip strengthener because my wife and grandkids weren't able to use mine. I obsessively use hand grip devices while watching movies or TV. I wanted the kids to be able to do the same. Now they can. The different resistance pieces are easy to change. I couldn't tell much difference between the #30 & #40 heads. But, after watching my wife & G-kids squeeze away on the Harbinger at lowest resistance, I am happy that I purchased them. Leave items like these on your coffee table... people will use them. Maybe TV is good for something after all."
4,Not bad,"I got this grip trainer last month. After some uses, it seems that the grip is durable and working good(although I can't say anything about how it will be from now on).It came with 3 weights, so I can switch the weight as my grip is improved.However, it seems that the grip is designed for people with big hands. My hands are average-sized, so it is not 100% comfortable to use it(although it is somehow acceptable size for me)."
2,1/2 the workout,"the top is a rubber resistance block. the 1st rep utilizes the full range of this block and is ideal. Unfortunately, you only get that on the 1st rep; every rep after it does not fully reset--only 1/2 way, so you don't get the full range."
1,Pretty bad,"The rubber sticks so you only end up exercising the contraction, not the release (the most important part).The rubber resistance bands barely fit onto the hand grip as well. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,disappointing,- the rubber weights lose their elasticity after a couple of reps- removable weights keep slipping off- all weights feel the samewaste of money
2,More problems than it should have,"For what seems a simple device, this has some problems that I did not anticipate when I ordered it. I rate it low because such a simple device has only a few features, so a few problems means it's overall problematic.1) It has a very strong rubbery smell that gets on your hands2) As you work it in your hand, the rubber resistance piece works itself off - imperceptibly at first so it just seems that the resistance has softened - and finally slips all the way off - after say 20 or 30 quick repetitions. You have to keep pushing it back in place just to use it.It does have some advantages. Good, I think, for larger hands. Grip is cushioned, but still works against your skin enough that over time it may help develop calluses (great for me since I'm using this to strengthen for windsurfing, which is tough on hands)."
3,Grip Strengthener,"This worked for a while, but stretched/weakened pretty quickly. I blew through the rubber resistance bands quickly and they never seemed to get their resistance back after a year of use."
2,Its terrible.,Made for a huge hand. Uncomfortable. Limited range of motion. Plastic padding on the handles creates blisters. 50 lbs resistence is too easy.
