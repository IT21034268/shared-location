1,One long Sales Pitch!!!!!!!,"After you have already purchased the course, why does the sales pitch go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on etc.................. I admit, I threw in the towel after the 4th CD, but enough was enough."
1,This course did not work for me,"I have been doing the exercises daily for almost two years. Still don't have perfect pitch. I have phoned the company and the best they could say was: ""That's very unusual"". I take that as meaning this system doesn't work for everyone, and if it doesn't work for you they have no idea why. I would suggest not buying this product unless you get a strong money-back guarantee."
2,Relax with your ear...blablabla,"yes, this audio course is very esoteric in it's application. He spends most of the time telling you what perfect pitch is but nothing to apply it. It gave no tangible exercises. Interesting, yes. This course was a loner. I would not buy it. Also annoying was the same 1 minute intro in the beginning of each ""lesson""."
3,question???,ok...there are people writing reviews on this product that REALLY like it and then the others REALLY hate it....who is the deal???
1,Disappointing course,"This course seems to be a combination of snake oil..., with Mr. Birge insisting that faith and slick talking will improve your ear. I had hoped for a series of progressive ear training exercises on CD, but there is nothing of any real substance provided. In addition I found that the course is really designed for two people to work on togeather, which was not what I had planned and is difficult for most adults to coordinate on a regular basis. This is a very expensive investment for the small return it provides."
1,"Too much talking, not enough Training!","A complete waste of time and money, unless you enjoy listening to a sales pitch about ear training - instead of actually doing any ear training."
4,A great read!,I very much enjoyed the book as the rememberings of a Texas Trail Driver from Texas to owning a ranch in Montana.Art Hagen
5,Outstanding,"This biography was an outstanding read. It captures the essence of life in the 18th Century, and also explains the long-term political and social causes of the conditions that led to the American Revolution in a dramatic and entertaining way. Franklin is a very human character, with qualities and faults. It is, in whole, a sympathetic biography, but what a life he lived. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the Caro/McCullough style of writing."
3,An interesting life dulled by the presentation,The author's research and scholorship can be impressive but causual history readers such as myself may find large sections of this book to be tedious reading. I found Walter Isaacson's biography much better organized and more enjoyable.
2,Beware small print in paperback version!,I thought it would be useful to warn people who have a hard time reading small print that the paperback version of this book is quite small indeed. Cramming nearly 800 pages into the tiny 5.2 x 8 inch format makes the font too difficult for me to read. Get the hardback version by all means!
3,Unique Look at B.F.,"The life and times of Ben Franklin is a really good book better than I thought it would be. H.W. Brands gave a good look at Ben Franklin's life. I enjoyed seeing the other side of him, the rebellious side Brands showed in this book. Overall I would recommend this book to someone else to read cause it wasn't boring at all."
3,This should be a lot shorter and sweeter,"This book has so much information on Franklin that I just dont care about. It even has information on people who interacted with Franklin, and some of their doings and thoughts. Lots of quoting letters and this and that, it gets really boring. This is not at all like ""John Adams"" by McCullough. I really dont want to know about every interaction and argument he had with everyone he ever met in his life. When you have to make yourself read when you really dont want to, you know the book is not very engaging.If your into this mans life hardcore, this is your book, otherwise look for something else."
5,Biography worthy of Franklin.,"This is perhaps the best biography I have ever read for the following reasons:The author has the wit, ironic tone, and command of the language that is worthy of Ben Franklin the writer.The prose is beautiful and is seamlessly interwoven with quotes from letters, articles, contemporary commentaries, and Ben's own memoirs.This book reads like a novel, tells a great story about a brilliant, admired, and patriotic man who lived an incredible life. He was a true renaissance man whom Brands has captured in all his many facets."
3,"Disappointing, pedantic","I really wanted to like this book ... Franklin is truly one of the great figures in American history. However, BF's achievements are buried under a pedantic writing style. Brands keeps telling the reader how great Franklin is, rather than letting the subject demonstrate this fact. I found myself skipping over a lot of the ""middle part"" and waiting for the Revolution to begin."
4,Interesting!,"H.W. Brands is a very good historian. This biography of Ben Franklin is really second to none. In these days when most biographers try to psychoanalyze their subjects with 21st century techniques, it is refreshing to read a work that focuses on the essence of biography: What did the person do and how well did he or she do it?Well done, Professor Brands. Thanks to you your readers will know more about Ben Franklin, his accomplishments, the scope of his interests and his contributions to America. Prior to this I always thought of Franklin as a stuffy sort. No more. He was a most learned man, a leading thinker of his day as equally at home in the capitals of Europe discussing issues of trade and government as he was at home in Philadelphia creating a new country. Long viewed as a great consensus builder make no mistake, Ben Franklin was an ardent rebel, one who made a most dramatic contribution to the foundation of the United States."
3,Fascinating Life,It's a wonderful account of how one man changes his world and ours. There are lots of interesting details in this story. If you want to know how America began...read this.
2,Lock Your Doors,"Positives:(1.) Well acted; almost too well acted such that I have to wonder about the actors. Certainly don't want them as neighbors.(2.) Creative gruesome behaviors. Perhaps a little too sick for a healthy mind.(3.) Nice flow to the story so kudos to the director and writers for that part.(4.) Reminded me of the Hong Kong movie ""Dream Home""; the movie ""Neighbors"" and another ""mom with dysfunctional, not so nice, kids"" movie from a couple years back but, sorry, can't remember it's title.Negatives:(1.) Usual dumb decisions by cops, and hostages too numerable to mention. Writers can be a bit more creative than that! Example: Survivor, in hospital, gives address of crime scene to hospital staff and only fire trucks show up hours later and to attend to a fire.(2.) Way too predictable ending that some bad people survive to carry on with their child abductions and probable future crime activities."
1,CRAP!!,"WARNING;..Do not get suckered into buying this crap!! One of the worse movies I have ever seen, and I have seen some losers!! Worst acting, plot, and story line in eons!! So incredibly BAD!!! I watched for free, and that was way too high a price!! I want the 1:42 minutes of my life back, that I squandered on this garbage!!!The only redeeming reason to watch is the gore!! Do yourself a favor, and watch the original instead!!!!"
2,It Was Okay,"I was disappointed in this remake. I thought the victims had way too many missed opportunities to fight back, and some of them were big and buff! The story line was unrealistic and the ending sucked!"
1,Garbage!!!!,"Growing up I was a fan of the original movie, it was typical 80's slash/gore and was great. This movie is a remake of the original, though only loosely so. The acting was pretty good, but the rewrite was horrendous. Not only are the victims in this movie easily the stupidest and most ignorant group of people to ever be involved with a bunch of psycho's, They actually have you rooting for them to be killed by the end of the movie...They had numerous chances to fight back, to escape etc and each time chose the exact WRONG thing to do. It makes the movie drag on, and seem completely unrealistic. Also, the original had a surprise ending, this one doesn't, just leaves things in a totally predictable way. Absolute and total garbage, Even if they paid me to watch this again I wouldn't do it. Don't waste a penny on this heap of crap!"
1,A bit confusing !,"Rebecca De Mornay is an Excellent acting artist. However, this movie had many senseless parts.The beginning didn't connected, the middle was a mixed up mess, and the end just topped off the disappointment in this movie!The gore carried the movie through. After all, it's a horror/thriller."
4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Mother's Day""","I don't think anyone ever expects a horror movie remake to be good. Unlike most genre fans, I've liked most of the reboots Hollywood pushes out including ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and even ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" When Darren Lynn Bousman's retooling of ""Mother's Day"" landed on my front porch, I was interested in seeing what the man behind the first three ""Saw"" sequels and ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" did to the 1980 original.If special features concern you when buying a movie, the ""Mother's Day"" Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack won't satisfy you. I think the movie is well-done and keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the whole thing. It's not so much a horror film as it is a psychological thriller which leaves you disgusted at what people are capable of if put in undesirable circumstances."
3,Glad I didn't need to hoist 2000 lbs!,"I'm very glad I didn't buy this item to lift 2,000 lbs. I only needed to lift a 250 lb item and it was a major struggle. The pulley system was not smooth and the nylon rope was too small to adequately grip. I will probably try to replace the rope with 5/16 cotton or else replace the whole system with one that works better."
2,$10 and isn't worth much more,"You get what you pay for. For $10 the hoist will lift some stuff, but I doubt if you can really lift a 2000 lb. item with it. The nylon rope is simply too slippery to grab. If you coil it around your hands when hoisting heavy objects, the small rope makes it too painful despite leather gloves.The pulleys are poorly made, they're really flat steel plates bolted together with plastic wheels and spacers in between. The screws come loose from the factory. I ended up putting Loctite red (thread locking compound) after tightening them. Do not over tighten as the pulley wheels will jam up.The chain links they supplied is a merely bent piece of steel. I would not trust them to support anymore than 50 lbs.You also need a rope cleat to tie the rope. This is not supplied in the kit. No wonder since a $6 rope cleat would add 60% to the cost of the hoist!"
2,Needs a lot of tweeking,"I agree with the previous reviewer. If the people from Hudson read these reviews - and they certainly should - they could capitalize on a good idea by making improvements to this ""prototype"". My specific recommendation would be to make the wheels wider and set them further apart so that they can actually carry the water wagon across turf. As it is, it topples over every other step. Apparently Hudson did not test this product before marketing it. This is a great idea for many people for many reasons, but as is, I could not recommend it."
5,The Essential Kris Kristofferson,Very much enjoyed this product.A long time fan but still found some excellent songs on here I hadn't been familiar with previously.A great product.
4,I really wanted to give Essential Kris Kristofferson 5 stars,The reason I gave Essential Kris Kristofferson four stars instead of five is I wish Essential Kris Kristofferson included more songs with Rita Coolidge.
2,BAD RENDITIONS,"THE TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM ARE NOT THE SAME TRACKS COMPILED FROM THE EARLIER ALBUMS, WHICH WAS WHAT I EXPECTED. THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXTREMELY FLAT, AND THE PERFORMANCES ARE BLAND."
2,regular,It is less interesting than other Bionicle game ever. The Biobicle area involves a poor scenario and a few small challenge.
3,Clearly I did not enjoy this book as much as others,"Wow, other people really loved this book. I thought it was simply OK. The author tells the story of a childhood of a unpopular girl. It is mostly a string of little vignettes strung together by the theme of her being unpopular and feeling left out. A few of the chapters are fairly powerful, but overall I was left wanting."
3,A worthy addition to a well-established genre,"The ""misfit coming of age"" genre of novel has a long pedigree. This time, the story is of a girl from a working class Japanese family trying to navigate the race and class divisions of 1970's Hilo, Hawaii. This is not the happy Hawaii most tourists see. The story is by turns funny, poignant, cruel, and hopeful. Just what the genre calls for. The author's unique addition here is the use of the Hawaiian creole (often called, inaccurately, pidgin) in the dialogue, which gives the voices in this tale an authenticity that is very rich. If the story itself is not terribly original, it is still a lively and interesting read and illuminates aspects of Hawaiian life that are invisible to most Americans."
4,"Great Deal, and Great product",Great price for a set with soo many #2 phillips head drivers. Quality is great!!
5,"EXCELLENT toy, for the whole family!","My son received this for Christmas and the WHOLE family has had fun! It is lightweight and very durable! You stick the back of the truck into what looks like a plastic exhaust pipe. At the end of that pipe is a black cushion that you can step on, jump on or push on with your hands and it shoots the car out! Depending on how hard you do this, the car will stay on the ground and roll or jump into the air! As I said, this is very durable and a toy that I would recomend! Dads seem to have as much, or more, fun than the kids! LOL Have Fun!I am updating this review because I want to share that this toy is not worth $79.99!! WHAT THE HECK IS THAT? It is PLASTIC. I picked it up a few years back for $20 at Target! Please save your money! Do NOT pay $80 for this toy....it isn't worth THAT much! If you want to pay that much, feel free to leave me a message and you can buy ours! LOL"
2,Misses the point,"I am a big fan of the Scene It? games, but this one is not as well put together. You absolutely must have prior knowledge of the Marvel comics and films if you are going to have fun with this game.Most of the questions have to do with a video clip of some kind, just like all these games. However, this one will then ask you a question that appears nowhere in the clip! A couple of examples-We were shown a Spiderman clip with him fighting Doctor Octopus. Great clip. But then the question was how did Doc Ock's arms get fused to his body?! Another time we were shown a clip from the Fantastic Four movie where Reed and Sue are talking. The question then asked where the two of them went to college. This information was again not in the clip.I have been very disappointed with this product. In a line of otherwise high quality Scene It? games, this one seems to have been put together by people who just didn't get the concept of the game."
5,Marvel Scene It: A+,Marvel Scene It is a must have for Marvel comic book and Marvel movie fans of all types. You will be entertained by the clips and enjoy the minigames that come within this game.
2,Philly Orchestra,"I really enjoy listening to this CD. It works well on my PC using iTunes. It works well in my Sony Discman. It works well in my home stereo system.TWO MAJOR problems however:1) The recording volume is soooo low, my PC and Discman volumes all need to be maxed out, and;2) It doesn't play in my car. The CD system 2005 Acura TL, 5.1 Surround Sound system) doesn't even recognize it as a disc and kicks it back out. There is no explanation to be found on the disc reading material.Therefore, I am returning the item."
1,Not very universal,"I couldn't find too much info on this. I have a Sony HC-21 MiniDV Handicam. All of the cameras in this line use the same type of battery so I figured it would probably be covered by this charger. It's not. I couldn't find a list of what batteries this charger is compatible with until I actually recieved the charger and opened the package. Now I can't return it and it does me no good. Maxell didn't have the manual on their web site either, so I couldn't have foreseen the problem. Maybe before I toss this thing in the garbage, I'll post list of batteries it is supposedly compatible with so others don't have this problem."
4,Very Cute But ...,"This toy is very small. They don't list the size of the toy, and I think that was done deliberately. Don't get me wrong, my son likes it very much, but he was disappointed to see that it is the size of a large Beanie Baby or Webkin rather than a regular stuffed animal. Also, if you're looking for the Garfield from the comics and cartoon, look elsewhere. This is the Garfield from the live action film. They don't look all that much alike. That might be want you want and if so purchase, but in the photo it didn't look as dissimilar to me as it does in reality. Overall, a very cute toy, but not a classic life size Garfield like I was hoping for."
4,A quality movie Garfield to last...,"I bought this Garfield for my five-year-old's birthday because her experience with Garfield was through the movies, not the comic strip, and this one looks like the movie Garfield. I also liked that its expression was mellow so I could look at it without my brain raising its own eyebrows from that wide-eyed, wide-grinning other Garfield expression! He's very soft, very sturdy, and a good substantial size. His facial features are a bit stiff -- the only part of him that's not squishy-soft (aside from his name tag) so I'm curious to see how that front piece will wear over time. And I do think I will be living with it years from now, unless my daughter takes it to college with her (which it will likely be prepared to do; it's so well put-together)."
3,didnt love it...but DIDnt hate it,"Rather short...but still LIKED it!at first i thought it was ""creating the video...and concert""i thought it meant creating the video...and the showing of the WHOLE Mot Wanted Tourbut i guess not!Heres how it goes down!Hilary Duff: Learning to Fly (Creating the Video AND Concert)-Creating the Video AND Concert (About 20 min. that ALSO INCLUDES the ""fly"" video)-""fly"" video (the same thing only shorted)(you dont really have to watch this [unless u want to] becuz its the same thing as the previuous feature)over all i give it 3 stars cuz i LOVE hilary duff and it was great to have a ""backstage pass"" (rather short one) to the ""Most Wanted"" Tour!!"
1,Forget it!,"Hilary duff (in my book) really should learn to fly with the mob she'll have after her with this DVD! My advice, forget it! With her voice she'll soon fly right out of the American spotlight. She really shouldn't be there now! Fly is the worst song on this cd. For some reason it made me think of this comic strip i saw with this guy in a restaraunt. the waiter fell in his soup and the dude said ""Waiter i believe your fly is in my soup."" a rather sick joke. No offense to crazy Hilary Duff fans."
3,it didn't work for me,"This book is obviously written for a very specific audience; I just happen not to be a part of that audience. If you are considering reading the book then you must be, or have been, in somewhat of a continual dark and down mood. Based on a friend's recommendation, I read the book and not only was I still down, but a little confounded. First, the artwork made me more depressed with its shattered edges and black and white presentation. Secondly, the simplistic approach to conveying its message, initially I thought okay a soft opening with the heavy content later; it's later and I am still waiting.Again, this book is obviously written for a very specific audience, I just happen not to be a part of that group."
5,Suprisingly Touching,"This pop-up book for adults and kids alike is short, but beautifully illustrated with a poetic theme that I found suprisingly emotional.A lovely work that you'll return to time and again."
2,Just Too Short,"I have two of Eggleston's DVD. The other one suffers from low quality non-professional looking video. This time the video quality is better and it is good to get to know his thoughts about photography a little more. But it's too short, only 26 minutes long. I don't believe anybody can capture enough information, aspects of a photographer's work for the duration. Too short especially as a commercial product."
4,New Inner Game,I enjoyed Tim Gallwey's Inner Game of Work. It was great to see him apply his principles in general rather than the specific modalities of tennis and music which I had found valuable in his previous works. For those who have read his previous work he has continued to create new subtle distinctions and expand his models to make it a worthwhile read.For the new reader you are in for a great surprise to be exposed to his understanding and insight.
3,the book degrades to many steoreotype formulas. focus is no longer important,"Disclaimer: by now I have read 63% of the book. so maybe the surprise is in the end.I have to admit i am rather surprised and frankly upset with the second book (the first one is inner game of tennis, which I believe is a masterpiece).The focus state (the key idea of the first book) is blamed for ""having no purpose"". The author compares focus state with driving with no purpose. He substitutes focus with so-called mobility state which is a conscious awareness.It seems the author is confused with his contradictory approaches.Not comparable with the first book. Not recommend it.PS: pls see the disclaimer in the beg.Best regards, Sergey."
4,"The ""Inner Game"" applied to the workplace","This is a descent book including a lot of good advice on how to improve your performance and success within a business and corporate environment. The advice flows naturally from the author's foundation established with his first book `The Inner Game of Tennis.' However, the themes and methods are not too repetitive. The book reads very well and easily."
3,duraball Pro,"Asked for grey color as in photo of product and product showed up in Blue, called company and they offered to return product or give a discount, I am sure they were banking on the latter, as I took it due to too much time required to return it..."
3,Leading edge info your tax man wants to burn!!!,"There are hundreds of books that are on the shelves that teach you how to make money investing and how to arrange your business affairs so as not to run afowl of the tax man in your juridiction. This book, 'Tax Haven Road Map' informs the reader on how to place one's money cleanly into a less offensive tax juridiction. 50% of the world's private capital is held offshore. There is no reason why the modestly successful business person can't be on the right side of this equation.The book is merely a starting point. However there are numerous avenues for the reader do make further investigations.It's not a complete how to book. But it is an eye openner."
5,Terrific resource,"This is a wonderful resource for screenwriters. Wharton demystifies the copywright/WGA registration issue, explains the legalities about writing true stories, offers great sample contracts, and clears up many of the questions writers are afraid to ask for fear of sounding ignorant. This book has been on my shelves for years, and I continue to refer and recommend it often. --Jenna Glatzer, jenna@absolutewrite.com"
5,Empowerment for the writer,"As a law student I can well attest to the confusions and complications that can arise from even seemingly simple legal concepts. Brooke Wharton not only gives an excellent framework for writers to help them approach possible pitfalls in the process of selling their work, but also provides nuggets of inspiration to motivate those of us who are intimidated by writing process. This handbook is an invaluable resource to all those interested in writing for Hollywood, and the wider world of publishing at large. Although it is not a substitute for legal counsel should a specific issue arise (whom am I to work against my industry), The Writer Got Screwed is a must read to help avoid any such problems in the first place. I only wish that my casebooks were as practical and easy to read!"
3,Good for newbies,"Given all the 5 star ratings, I expected better. Not that this isn't a good book, but it depends on the reader's sophistication. If you don't know anything about some of the basic legal and business aspects of the publishing biz, this book is a good start. On the other hand, if you're a detail oriented person who really wants to dig in deep into this subject, you may find the content a bit light."
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed by this product. It looks great when you first put it on, either alone or as an eye shadow base, but doesn't last long at all. It gets in the creases and is pretty much all worn off half way through the day. Expected a better quality product for the price I paid. I bought it hoping to be a replacement for my Clinique Touch Tint that was discontinued, but will continue my search, this doesn't compare."
5,Like this product alot!,"I was always a powder eye shadow user until I got a sample of this. It is easy to use, has great staying power and I really love the shimmer of the color."
3,iPod Cable - Does the Job,This cable does the job of connecting the iPod to the Denon Receiver. However the user interface is very basic in nature. The Denon remote can be used to select songs.
3,Mystery Classics,"These movies were very disappointing. The dialogue was dated and unrealistic, and the characters were neither likeable nor believable. I was particularly disappointed in the Kennel Murder Case."
4,Liked enough,I liked two of the four movies in this DVD. The two I liked were actually ones I had seen before. I did give this DVD away after I finished watching it. It is a good collection.
5,Can't get enough,great to see stories well acted and well plotted. you see so many familiar faces of actors who have basically always had supporting roles
2,Mystery Classics,"This disc not worth the money, even at only $6, EXCEPT for William Powell, The Kennel Murder Case. ONLY movie worth it's salt. Spy in White skips terribly. Sound in that movie not good, and NO credit to James Mason. Other two movies just common B or C. Cecy Ivie"
1,POOR POOR QUALITY,"Skipped,stuttered,lips out of sync. Could not access a root menu.After 3rd film played screen was blank.Had to remove and re-insert.I have returned this utterly terrible product.The first film with Edward Arnold had no problems and was a great movie."
3,Light Hearted Mysteries,"Mystery Classics:These were old mystery movies I hadn't seen before, but I enjoyed them very much. I would recommend this to anyone who was interested in light mysteries."
5,GREAT CLASSICS****,"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THIS TIME PERIOD THEN THIS MOVIE SET IS FOR YOU!!! IT IS GREAT FUN.WILLIAM POWELL ,LLOYD BRIDES AND MARY ASTOR.I GREW UP WHATCHING THESE FLIMS WITH MY PARENTS.THIS IS OLD HOLLYWOOD AT IT'S BEST FOR THIS PRICE YOU CAN NOT PASS THESE MYSTERY CLASSICS UP."
5,Best Bargain For $3.99 Ever!,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching these 1930s-1940s screen legends at their very best. I recommend this one to anyone who loves: ""A Good Mystery."" John S."
3,Rainy Day watching,"The cover is a little bit deceptive, because William Powell is only in one of the stories, but they are all good old fashioned who dunits!"
3,"clear, not creamy","This product does provide hold. However it is a clear gel-like substance which does not impart moisture or much shine to the hair. I have a short hairstyle which is piecy and chunky and I have been looking for a substitute for Pantene's Pro-v Texturizing Pomade with no real success. This product is ok and provides hold but it dries quickly, which I could not relate to a wax. I will not buy this product again."
3,"Strong Hold, but Not For Me","The hold is strong, but my hair is quite oily, so even if I try to sparingly use this product on my hair, it looks a bit too greasy.Again, it could just be my hair, it might work much better for you."
2,Not for my hair type at all,"I am Caucasian and have fine and pretty limp hair. This stuff doesn't do a darn thing for my hair in the way of hold, volume or styling."
1,"Cheap Chinese Junk, but will work in a pinch.","Just like the title says. The threads are sloppy and these do not thread into the intake like nice quality studs do. They wobble and go crooked even when tight. The nuts do not start onto the threads easily and are sloppy too. They do work, but that is all I can say for them."
1,It was nice while it worked,"I liked the piano-like finish of this item and enjoyed the feel of the keys. Unfortunately, it only took 5 months for the keyboard to start breaking down. Several of the keys are now broken -- you have to beat them to get them to type -- and the hole keyboard will probably be in the garbage in a few weeks time. I've never seen anything like this from any of my much cheaper keyboards. This was my last purchase from Razer."
3,It's okay,"Cons:It's white, which is nice but I bought it with the pro-click mouse, next to which they keyboard is a slightly yellowy white. Doesn't matter so much when it's on as the blue glowing bits tend to disguise it somewhat.There is an annoyance in that the pg up, pg dn, home & end block of keys is pointlessly non-standard. Missing the key you're after will plague you for the first few weeks. On the pointless rearrangement front, there's also 'start' in stead of the windows logo, which is still MS-centric but not intuitive. There's also only one WIndows key, not two so Win-L is a mildly more annoying shortcut to use.I'm not a big fan of the keys, either - prefer a more laptop-like keyboard. It's also huge. Really big. Plus, I never use keyboard macros so the additional buttons are, for me at least, a bit of a waste.Pros:Two USB ports are useful, although they are 1.2, not 2.0.The ipod dock is useful if you have an ipod.It looks nice if you have a white desktop."
5,Another great Barbie game,"My 8-year old daughter received this as a gift and absolutely LOVES it. It is similar to the Beauty Boutique in that the user is given an array of choices for various items (tops, pants, colors), then when all the choices have been made, the game shows the slick, completed version of the model (in this case, a runway fashion show of each outfit). As Barbie successfully designs outfits for each assignment, she is given access to new design choices. My daughter was very excited by the clothing and color choices and her feeling of success in ""designing"" beautiful clothes - it was a pleasure to listen to her ooh, ahh and congratulate herself on her fashion skills as she played.Unlike the Barbie movie games, there are no riddles to solve or an overarching storyline, which would make this very suitable for younger players as well."
2,Too Expensive for Such Simplicity,"This shoe is just made of one piece of leather. The sole is completely flat, no heel, no curvature for your bottom inside foot curve. Granted, it has the Birkenstock cork footbed inside, but from the outside looks very flat footed. It is hard on your foot when walking on hard surfaces, or running, due to the lack of heel. No grip on bottom of sole. No cushioning on inside surfaces. For the simple construction, it is not worth the ridiculously high price!"
1,In total ignorance of science....,"This book attempts to challenge every discipline of science with nothing more than statements based on belief. The so called ""scientific"" theories presented are in direct conflict with the basic foundations and evidence of physics, astronomy, geology, and chemistry. The author uses scientific sounding statements in attempting to convince the reader that there is substance to his arguments. The so called ""facts"" presented in this book have long ago been shown to be based on totally faulty assumptions."
5,"Easy read, plenty of graphics. Makes great overheads","This book has powerful visuals for copying and passing on to students or others. Many of the pages are also designed to create overheads to project for a class.The arguments and proof here is good, but not as thorough as some of the other books by Morris and others.You won't go wrong w/this one, though."
1,Poor Science,"Simply a very bad book. Poor science, poor research. Misleading quotes from real scientist. Dishonesty at its best. Just more of the same from creationist, who want you to believe their religion. Try reading what real scientist say, and see why evolution was accepted 130 years ago."
1,"Pitiful, Simply Pitiful","I hate to criticize this book so heavily, since it appears the author spent a great deal of time concocting his ridiculous proofs for a young Earth, but the fact is that his ideas are laughable at best. In his attempt to cling on to his young-earth creation fantasy, he makes claims which on the surface seem logical to the uneducated reader, but for those who are willing to do their own research on the ideas he presents, they will find Morris just another hapless creationist trying to use science to his advantage, but failing miserably."
1,A Suggestion..,"I simply wanted to urge everyone who has read this to really dig into the science of the issues. Don't take anyone's word for it. Read the science articles yourself to gain a better understanding of why the author is claiming what he claims. It may be tough for those who are not experienced in the different science fields, but I believe it is worth the time and effort.As a Christian myself, I realize that it is important to be able to identify with others who need Christ. Ignorance in logic and understanding of science will turn off many educated atheists to Christianity. That is all, thank you."
5,The Young Earth,"The book arrived in good shape and a timely manner.Dispite the book being several years old, the information is timeless. Scientifiic facts are hard on evolutionists."
1,Insane !,"Where to start. First of all, there is plenty of evidence that people have been here longer than the 'young earth' suporters claim the age of the earth is. Secondly, PUT THE BIBLE AWAY...PLEASE!!! It is not a science book, never has been and never will be and People need to stop acting as if it is.There is overwhelming evidence of every kind that tells us how old the Earth is. Get on with it already.Stop taking the bible literally. It's annoying."
3,Raju on Indian Religion,"In this book, Raju attempts to explain to Western students the complex theories behind Indian philosophical thought. He covers the major schools within Hinduism as well as Buddhism, Jainism, and contemporary trends. The book is the only one of its kind in that it addresses such a broad subject mater in an elementary text. The only problem I had with he book is that, in attempting to teach Western students about Eastern concepts, Raju often uses Western psychological terms to express Eastern ideas such as karma and reincarnation. I believe that such a distillation of powerful concepts by describing them in Western terms cheapens what is an otherwise informative and sympathetic view of Indian religion. However, in general, this book is a good place to start if you are looking to delve into Indian religion."
3,Okay,"For the price, this cover was pretty good; however, it is incredibly thin and has no padding and it is also pretty slippery. I would probably suggest spending a few more dollars to get something a little better..."
1,broke after 3 days,"I only used this for a few days before it broke. One of the elastic bands inside must have snapped, I arrived at the car to find the cover all shriveled up around the steering column. Too bad, I liked it otherwise."
2,Defective,The quality in the picture looks good but the construction is very poor and the material is thin without lining to prevent slipping. The elastic came apart when barely stretched. Amazon was hassle free when I wanted to return the item for a refund. Thanks Amazon!
2,Nice for temperature control. too slippery,"Kept the wheel from getting too hot, but it was definitely slippery on my wheel so had to take it off eventually bc it interfered with turning. needs some grippers under there!"
1,Waste of money :(,"I was buying this as a replacement for my old steering wheel cover of the same type. I had the previous cover for over three years before it started stretching out. This cover however, didn't even last three hours. I put it on my steering wheel before driving to work at 7, by 9:30 when I had to get into my car again I found it lying on the floor. One of the elastics had snapped and now its basically useless unless I feel like replacing the elastic.Overall, there is nothing elegant about it. It is a simple cover, lacks any kind of padding or liner, a bit slippery on the wheel (probably from lack of liner), and workmanship is poor."
4,this is the shiz,"wow. they did it. one of the best stuff i have heard in a while man. hellhammer....amazing. andy winter.....amazing. man, this whole damn cd is amazing. get it!!"
3,Note these are not Belgian Waffles,It makes the same amount of batter into 6 smaller thinner waffles as other irons make into 4 Belgian Waffles. They do mean traditional (thin) waffles.
2,Pain in the neck to clean!,The waffle maker makes waffles just fine but it is really a hassle to clean. I don't understand why the company did not make the waffle plates snap out so you can throw them in the dishwasher. The cleanup actually deters my husband and I from using it. I would not have bought it if I had known the plates were not removeable.
4,b-day gift,great product...arrived in timely manner considering it was a b-day gift and she loved it.
4,Great waffle iron,"This is my 2nd Cuisinart 6-slice waffle iron -- the first was smashed during our move. It makes 6 waffles very quickly so I can whip up a double batch and freeze for fast breakfasts. This current model seems to cook the waffles more quickly than my 15 year old model did -- great! Unfortunately, Cuisinart removed the feature that locks the lid when turned on it's side so that it can be stored vertically. But all-in-all, it is the best waffle iron I've owned."
1,Poorly designed waffle iron,"I am very disappointed in this waffle iron. It does not cook the waffles properly. They are using a round heating element on a rectangular area. This element does not distribute the heat effectively and causes the waffles to cook unevenly and like the other reviewer, the waffles never get crisp. The middle circle cooks far more than the edges. This situation also causes uneven depths for the waffle. My old broken 29 dollar(Cuisinart by the way) waffle iron works 10 times better. All in all, I hate this thing. It is one of the worse products I have ever purchased."
1,Worst waffle maker ever!!!!,"This waffle maker has a good name and says it makes six waffles but it has some major design issues. First, when you add too much batter it runs out the front right on to the controls which are very difficult to clean. We have tried thick batters, thin batters, read all of the instructions and it just does not matter it runs out the front. So, to make wafffles without the mess you have to put in a minimal amount of batter so you only get to make 3 waffles instead of six.Second, the maker doesn't get hot enough and the waffles are never crispy, even when you turn it up to six, the outer edges of the waffles are soggy. We have no idea why.Third, it seems like the plates of the waffle maker are too close together so it does not hold very much batter and makes whatever batter you put in there over flow faster.Overall it is very, very very crappy! Totally inferior to my old $29 Black and Decker."
1,Not worth the money!,"We've had this waffle maker for over a year and it's been a huge disappointment. It beeps when it thinks its ready, it beeps when it thinks it thinks the waffle is done (and it's not)... it beeps all the time! We've tried adjusting the temperature setting and a variety of recipes to eliminate ""user error."" Waffles cook unevenly - middle ones are crisp-ish and outside ones are soft. AGH! I frankly just want to toss it out the window."
2,Cuisinart WAF-6 Traditional-Style 6-Slice Waffle,"This is the worse waffle iron to clean up. Makes great waffles, but it got to the point where I lade down the law in the house: "" whoever makes the waffles has to clean the waffle maker"" guess what we have not had any waffles for 6 mo. Now. ""Time to look for another one""."
1,not up to cuisinart standards,"I wanted to like this waffle iron because I love the Cuisinart brand, and currently own the Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle Maker that works amazingly...but in the end I was so disappointed. My waffles didn't come out crispy, but rather a soggy, steamed mess and the clean-up was a nightmare. I had read previous reviews and was very careful about the amount of batter I put in the waffle maker, and the batter still overflowed all over the machine and my counter. Trying to clean the dried batter out of the control panel, and the metal lip around the bottom with a toothpick was rather aggravating. As a side note I was expecting a waffle maker that makes six full square waffles, and was unhappy to find that this waffle maker makes six small rectangle waffles. I would not recommend anyone buy item."
3,There must be a better waffle iron out there,"I purchased this waffle iron after reading many reviews for many waffle irons. I can't say I am thrilled. The waffles really are not crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Pretty much soft. As for the amount of batter to put onto the griddle - OMG! Definitely use less than what it calls for - 2 cups is WAY TOO MUCH!!! After reading many reviews I knew to cut back, but I still had a big mess, several times. So now I use maybe 1/2 cup batter, but then I don't get full 6 squares. I get awfully tired of cleaining batter out of the crevasses. The recipes make tons of waffles, way too many for a family of 4. I haven't tried all the recipes from the booklet yet, but none are WOW! tasting.Would I buy it again? Probably not."
4,"Works great, but design is flawed.","Don't get me wrong, this works well, and makes 6 waffles at a time. Fast. The problem is stupid design. The bottom wraps around the sides, and the batter runs into the crack between the plastic bottom and the hot metal side. Which cooks the dough into glue, which you get to dig out with a knife if you have cleaning OCD. See pictures I posted of the problem. This sucker gets really hot, duh, on the whole outside. Nice blister on the thumb to prove it."
4,Very good product.,This waffle iron works very well as long as you fill in down the middle and don't put more than l l/2 cups of batter in it. A temp around 4 gives a nice crispy waffle.
3,nice waffles...but what a mess!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great waffle maker for people that need to make lots of waffles in a short amount of time, however the design is such that when the batter comes out the sides and it will come out the sides, there are seams that make it very difficult to clean. The instructions call for 2 cups of batter. This will cause a huge mess to clean. The batter will come out the front all over the dial and make a huge mess!!Good waffles, but plan on doing lots of cleanup afterwards."
2,Looks cool; works bad,Uneven heating across the plate. No consistency. Waffles come out soft.Go with the round ones. They only make one big waffle at a time but you can be proud of the results
5,The Perfect Family Waffle Iron,"With two hungry adults and two hungry children, waiting for our traditional small round waffle iron at mealtime just didn't work. Waffles made before hand and kept warm in the oven lost their crispness.The Cuisinart 6 slice waffle iron made it possible for the four of us to enjoy crisp, hot, just out of the iron waffles, at the same time."
2,Disappointing for a very expensive Cuisinart product!,"When I found a traditional waffle iron that makes more than one at a time - I had to have it! Paid big big money for it and wish I had bought 2 single waffle irons instead! Jeesh. It's cute, but designed poorly. It overflows onto the control knob and is full of cracks and crevices that don't clean up easily or quickly. Come on Cuisinart - you should know better.Recommendation - don't waste your money. Try 2 single irons at a fraction of the cost and don't ever plan to join your family when having a waffle breakfast."
3,Cuisinart Waffle Iron,"Waffle maker heats quickly and it is not as hard to clean as others have said. I didn't have a lot of run over when putting in the batter.The biggest problem is that the waffles stick to the ""NO STICK"" surface. I have tried spraying them with Pam, but that only made the waffles not crispy. At times they stick to both plates and pull apart when opened.I have only used it twice, so maybe the sticking problem will get better with use."
1,Where do I return,"After first use, I am very unhappy with this product....the waffle is still welded on and I cannot get it off. The unit is unusable. Who do I contact...Amazon or Crisinart?"
2,Very disappointing,"We make a lot of waffles in our house, so when our old 4 waffle maker was on its last legs, I saw the 6 waffle iron and thought it was perfect. Unfortunately the size of the unit was barely larger than my old 4 waffle unit. The actual waffle size is so much smaller than a regular waffle both in width/length and in height, there really is no gain. IMO there is no reason to pay the extra money for 6 waffles when you really aren't getting anything more. I never used it and am sending it back, so I can't speak for how well it actually makes waffles, but if you're looking to be able to make more waffles than a 4 unit iron, don't bother."
1,Wrong Product,"Amazon showed picture of ""traditional 6 square waffle iron"" with description. Received waffle stick iron from company instead. Investigation showed that it was Amazon's mistake but took a lot of time and effort to contact the company and try to get a refund."
2,Disappointed After Using for Several Years,"I've used this waffle iron almost every Sunday for over two years. I would NOT buy it again.Here's the problems:1. Super-Loud Buzzer that goes off constantly. We called Cuisinart, they said it is NOT possible to turn it off.2. Heat-adjustment knob broke very quickly. We now use pliers to adjust.3. Not very well made. Besides the knob, I dropped it and plastic broke off in two parts.Here's the pluses:1. Cooks six waffle-sections at a time.2. Cooks good waffles.I still worry about non-stick cooking surface (shown toxic at high heat levels), but I suppose the waffle iron is okay because heat doesn't get too high. But you just can't buy a non non-stick waffle iron anymore..."
1,Ooze and Beep,"We have not been happy with ours. After trying several recipies, most ooze out the back and or front into the control knob or don't cover the suface area when you put in less batter. Also anoying is the beeping signaling that the waffle is done, which starts immediatly after putting in the batter and continues on and on. We have found that we should wait for 3 to 4 cycle of beeps before it is really done. Looks nice, but is not a performer."
4,WONDERFUL WAFFLES,"I definately reccomend this waffle maker to one and all! Once I worked out the kinks... it works wonderfully. Make sure to season the griddle extrememly well. I mean extremely well. (I poured vegetable oil in the griddles and let it set overnight) I learned the hard way... I only used pam spray, and that didn't work so well. The first batch stuck like crazy... and what a *itch that was to clean. It took forever to get all of the cooked waffle out of the crevices. So oil it well and you should no problems what so ever! For this model you need to make a double batch of waffle mix to fill with the 2 cups necessary.So enjoy!!!"
5,Waffles Made Easy,This thing makes it all easy. It tells you when its ready to start cooking and it tells you when your waffles are ready to be taken off the grill.
1,BAD NEWS,"Used 4 times with different batter each time. The results were BAD NEWS each time.None were cooked through, stuck to the iron each time, dogs loved results.Way over priced. This product is a JOKE! Given to GOODWILL, but should have placed in trash."
2,too much oil,"This product arrived on time in good condition. I thought I had properly followed the instructions to make waffles, but when the bell rang and I opened the appliance, half of the waffle stuck to the top. I called customer service and they said I should have used more cooking oil. I cannot imagine what an unhealthy breakfast these waffes must be if you have to add that much oil. I may try Pam next time, but so far, I am not impressed with this product."
2,"Makes Good Waffles, But Needs Re-engineering","This was given to us as a gift. We returned it the next day. Although it made nice waffles, it had three major faults which are the reasons we returned it.1) The handle is part plastic and part metal. The metal portions become extremely hot when the appliance is on.2) The latch on the lid was very difficult to release once the waffles were cooked. However, on one occasion, during the middle of cooking, the lid blew open with explosive force and could have caused serious injury if anyone had been standing over it.3) The batter really does go everywhere on this machine. It leaked all over the sides and the switch, making it a pain to clean.There are better, safer, machines on the market."
1,Worked for a short time,"Received this waffle iron as a gift.Worked well at first--seemed sturdy.After a couple dozen uses, the timer started losing accuracy.The heating became uneven.Then it died--unfortunately, just after the warranty.Called Cuisinart support...No certified repair shops in San Diego.No spare parts distributed for this iron.No other help from Cuisinart.Too bad."
4,Cuisinart WAF-6 Traditional waffle iron,"I am happy with this product. It is very hard to find a waffle maker that makes thin waffles. The machine works great. After the initial oiling of the plates I have found it unnessessary to oil(I don't use spray). It takes a few minutes to warm up, but once warm it cooks quickly. My only complaint is with the directions. Don't ever put 2 cups of batter in the macine or you will have a huge mess, especially if you use one of their recipes. The basic recipe in the book rises a lot during cooking due to the large amount of baking powder. It makes great waffles, but you only need 1 to 1 1/4c. batter. The recipes also make 2 to 3 time more waffles than stated. It is also not as tall as the specifications state, however this was a plus for me because it fit better where I wanted it. In short, I recommend this product to anyone who likes traditional waffles and needs to make lots of them."
3,quality pics,This camera takes great pictures for the price. It's also fairly easy to use. A couple major drawbacks: 1.The length of time for the camera to reset for the next picture is extremely long (up to 10 seconds). 2.The camera goes through batteries very quickly.I must emphasize the great picture quality produced by the A210. Compared to other brands in the same price range; you'll get better prints from the A210.
3,Good starter camera with battery problems,"This was my first digital camera and it served me very well for about two years. At the time I bought it, it was a tremendous deal - 3x optical zoom, 3MP for less than $130 - with macro and movie capability.About two months ago, it began eating batteries, even when turned off. I notice a number of other people have also had this problem. Now, I can put brand new batteries in it, take 3 or 4 shots, turn it off, and the next day the batteries are dead. When it was new, I could take 10-20 photos, leave the camera for weeks (sometimes months) and then take many more.On a week-long vacation where I took close to 100 pictures, I used only one set of batteries. Now, a set of batteries usually won't get me through 24 hours, even if I take less than 5 pictures with no flash.I read about another battery defect in a different Fuji model that was helped by taking out and re-inserting the batteries before putting the camera away but haven't had a chance to try it yet.Bob"
4,Good starter digital camera,I've just purchased the Fuji A210 for my daughter and found it to be a very good camera. The photographs came out rich and in living color. The camera is easy and user friendly. Not a bad camera for those of you just starting out into the digital photography world. Are there better cameras? Yes there are. But at the price you pay for the A210 this is a decent camera at a fair price.
1,Got it free - not worth the price,"I got this camera with ""reward points"" from my credit card. What a waste of points. It's clunky, pictures turn out grainy, and it eats batteries for breakfast. I'm about to Freecycle mine. Adious ""FinePix."""
2,look for a better one,"The manufacturer's rating of this camera, at >260 frames per battery set with LCD on, is a complete fraud. I have never managed to get more than 15 frames out a freshly charged high-capacity new battery set and I had this camera exhaust the set in just 3 frames. The zoom jumps discontinuously, often preventing one from using an optimal setting."
1,Not even good for a beginner,"I'm not a photographer. I like to take quick snapshots of the kids, animals, etc. This camera couldn't even do that! It takes SO long to start up, and even longer to actually TAKE a picture. When trying to take a picture of a toddler it's impossible. It MIGHT be an okay camera is you're using it for inanimate objects, but I'm not even sure about that. And don't even try to take a picture in anything but perfect lighting. The pictures are unrecognizable.My advice... by any other camera than this one. I can't imagine it would be any worse."
1,WAY overrated!!,"For those of you who reviewed this camera, stating how easy it is to use ""your first digital camera""... well, the fact is, this camera is nothing special at all.The reluctance of the zoom to zoom (try it!), the shutter delay after pushing the shutter button, the SERIOUSLY long time it takes to set itself up for another photo after taking one, and of couse, the major battery-eating problems lead me to be totally underwhelmed by this camera. Sure, it's got decent features... but ALL decent digital cameras do the same exact things. And BETTER.I'm bringing mine back - don't waste your time."
2,i wish i could return this camera,"When I was looking for a digital camera to take to Europe, a friend warned me to buy one that could take standard batteries, because I wouldn't be able to re-charge one that has an installed lithium ion battery. So my main reason for getting the Finepix was because it takes AA batteries. What a mistake. This camera goes thru batteries like you would not BELIEVE. I mean I can put in a fresh new set of AA's and within 5 shots, I am getting the low battery light. Take 2 more shots and the camera shuts itself down.It also takes terrible nighttime photos, you cannot see thru the viewfinder, and once you take the shot its very washed out. What a waste of $299."
4,Fujifilm A210,"Same as most reviewers on this camera, my first one and I love it! I've had it close to two weeks now and am finding myself addicted to taking pictures just because I know I don't have to worry about buying another roll of film. I haven't upgraded from the 16mb card, but that hasn't been a problem since I download my pictures onto my computer everyday. I already had rechargeable batteries and they come in use now more than ever (I used them pretty much just for my cd player). Like another poster stated, the alkaline batteries it came with died soon after playing around with the camera trying to figure things out - approximately 19 pictures at 3.2mp, not to mention checking out the menu on the LCD screen. Defintely happy with the purchase."
1,Spend a little more and get a better shot!,"The pictures that come from this camera, are grainy and unpredictable. Sometimes, it takes 2 or 3 shots to capture one picture because for whatever reason, the picture will be blurred - even at the highest setting with great lighting. I have been using digital cameras for the past few years and this one is the worst I've ever seen. I bought it for the extra memory card, and cradle but the camera isn't worth it. While the software and camera is easy to use, I find it more frustrating to take a quality picture. I frequently find myself reaching for my old trusty Olympus to ensure that I get the shot right. If I had to do it over again, I'd spend another $150 and buy another Olympus. This camera is more frustrating than it's worth!"
4,It's a camera and does what cameras do well...,"I bought the camera for my 12 year old son. He paid for it with his allowance so his $30 or so went a long way. It zooms, takes video, and you can download to a computer or flat screen tv, etc. My son is happy, my own $200 camera is safe in its case. He can do whatever he wants with it and I know it's not an expensive iPad/iPod Touch that can be easily dropped and cracked or broken or lost - giving parents too much stress.We are happy with our purchase."
3,Good but not like the Fujifilm 2400,I was given the Fujifilm 2400 as a baby shower gift in 2001. I knew that my beloved Nikon FM was just too slow to keep up with all the baby pictures I wanted to take. The colors & definition was awesome. But the MP's weren't there for great enlargements. So when my husband suggested I upgrade & he use my 2400 I went for it. I liked the Fujifilm enough to go with another one. I got the A210 and was disappointed. The colors & definition just aren't there. I've had it over a year & have yet to have a photo that I want to enlarge more than a 5x7. I find myself using the older 2400 when it's nearby. I do still carry the A210 in my purse all the time & use it very often. But I keep window-shopping for an upgrade. Another Fujifilm?? I'm not sure. I'll keep reading the reviews.
1,Don't waste your money and time..,I bought this camera because I was on a tight budget and thought I was getting a good value for the price. For a few dollars more I could have found a digital camera I would enjoy much more. What I can say in favor of this camera is it works and could be a good starter for a child or teenager. Here's why I strongly recommend NOT choosing this camera:*It's bulky. Don't bother trying to fit it in your pocket.*It's poorly contructed. The plastic exterior scratches easily and the coating rubs off after only a few months of use.*Not user friendly. It's difficult to change options and preferences. Preferences (such as date and time) have to be programed frequently. You cannot take pictures without doing this (each time you turn on the camera).*Poor flash. The flash is too bright and makes everyone look really pale and washed out- Photoshop can do little to correct this. Removing the flash usually means total blur and/or darkness.*Unreasonably long delay. Enough said.
1,"SLOW,SLOWER, MISSED A SHOT, NO PICTURE TAKEN","Bought this camera at the recommendation of the service rep at Walmart for an inexpensive easy to use camera for my wife.Only good for still shots,slow to startslower to reset 2nd picturemissed a shot its so slowsometime never reset (Battery eater)thus no pictures at allQuality of picture is OK, but that only happens when you can actually take one.Horrible frustrating camera that both my wife and I hate to use - getting a new camera, just not a fuji"
3,A good deal but lacks sharpness,"I've used a pretty wide range of digital cameras so I feel comfortable grading the Finepix 210 a solid 3, possibly a 3.5. I bypassed inexpensive 2MP cameras to make the jump to this, one of the least expensive 3MP ones around that had decent reviews.After using it I can say that it is definitely lacking the sharpness of competitors like the Nikon Coolpix 3100. I only use it at the highest quality level and even closeups for portraits are obviously not razor sharp like I've become accustomed to with the 3MP Nikon and Sony products.On the other hand this camera is at least $50-$70 less than the competitors and when accessories are factored in I was able to get the camera, a 128MB xd card and the handy USB cradle (with rechargeable battery) for $100 less than I could've with Nikon or Sony.The bottom line: this is a decent camera that puts 3MP in reach of the average casual user but it is not very sharp."
2,Bad picture quality,"Picture looks great online but when you open shipment and see the blurry picture, you'll be disappointed. Don't expect more for the price I guess."
3,Dark Tales for Night,All the words are there. Navigating is not so easy since there is no table of contents. I am bookmarking the title page of each story so when I come back to the book it will be easier to pick a story.
2,letters with accents replaced by question mark (?),"This is about the Kindle Fire version of this book. All the french words with accentuated characters are not displayed correctly. All those characters are just replaced by a question mark. For example, in ""the murder in the rue morgue"", we can read ""Th??tre des Vari?t?s"" instead of ""Thétre des Variétés""... And there are many words like that in this book."
3,"Poorly done to be honest, but hey it's still free Poe!","There were a lot of formatting errors in it overall and some misspelled things here and there. Overall it didn't affect the overall point of the book, which is to simply read a story or two from Poe. It doesn't have any reference points that most paid books will have. That being said, it's free so take what you can get I guess. It's Poe at his best as usual.Ruckischmuckle"
2,not indexed,"This book was not indexed for Kindle use which was frustrating because it was a compilation of works. I could not skip story to story, with out paging through the whole thing.Very disappointing."
4,Not Enough,"I really like Poe, but this book simply did not feature enough of his work. There are other collections with more stories. Not a knock on Poe, just the collection."
2,Poe? Where?,"This isn't Poe's work, it is people writing about him. Very disappointed to not see his work as the title of the book would have us believe."
5,great classic,"recommend reading his collection, it is well written literature, i hate this amazon review minimum word requirement ,i hate this amazon review minimum word requirement"
3,Edgar Allen Poe,This book was Ok but would like to have more of his short stories. It did expose me to some of his other writings.
4,Poe's History,This book came with a handy little background informational section. I am enriched in the works and death of Edgar Allan Poe. :)
2,Guess He's not for me,Couldn't get into the book. Don't know if it's the writing for me or the editing that hurt the most. Was very confusing for me to read.
2,Too hard to use,The text of this is fine. But there is no flexibility in moving around among the stories. You go from beginning to end - linearly.
1,Wrong Description,"Tagalog edition is not true,,I expected to a translated version of EAP book to Tagalog but it is only a photocopied version of a library book in English"
1,Marriage on the rocks,"A married man & a single woman fall in love. He knows he is married, she knows he is married. His wife lives with him, and so does Amanda.From the back of the book: 'Her hatred had turned to love. Amanda Raymond had resented Marc Chandler ever since the death of her parents, when he had offered her charity. But now the tables were turned. With his sick mother and young daughter in need of care, it was Marc who desperately needed and sought her help.Yet how could she cope with the increasing hostility of Marc's wife, who at times appeared half mad?But more important, how could Amanda hope to combat her ever growing attraction of Marc?'"
2,It helps me a lot to learn econometrics well.,"Since I was confused with learning economics, My teacher assistant recommended me to read the book. Now I get a lot of knowledge from this book, so I re-recommend it to somebody else"
2,don't try it without a professor,"i found the book hard to follow, especially without having studied the underlying statistics by themselves.warning! there are NO numerical answers to problems in the back of the book; one has to buy the sketchy solution manual to get anything. cheesy."
5,Best Econometric book that I ever read,One can find in this book the only way to jump from theory to practice. Many samples well treated in this book. If you love Econometrics and time series theory you have to read this book
2,No difference,I don't seem to notice a difference. Was taking 2 or 3 per day. Switched to food combining and am having better luck.
3,"Pretty, but low-quality burner","I'd bought one from another vendor. It's pretty when mounted on a wall, that's for certain, but I have a feeling the Kosmos burner on it must be made in China now. This type of burner should put out an intense, steady light with little effort, and that's not the case.If you choose to use it, I'll say that even with the best violet stripe Gaudard wick, the raisers lift it unevenly (which will cause smoking and a tall flame spike if not corrected), you'll have to use tweezers to level that wick, and then it'll go uneven when you try to raise or lower it with the wick winder.Also, the knob is poorly secured to the wick winder, and will come loose to turn freely if turned too hard.I intend to replace the burner with an antique Kosmos Brenner 14, the same size, which should work a lot better on this admittedly pretty lamp. If you don't do that, I suggest leaving it as decor."
4,"Many, Many Facts about Beer","I have been an avid homebrewer now for about three years and, in that time, I have accumulated my share of books on the subject of homebrewing. ""Beer for Dummies"" has more tidbits of information than any other. However, the book is written in a style similar to an encyclopedia so if you are looking for a book that has novel-like reading appeal, you shold pass this one up. But if you want a book that reads like an almanac, loaded with lists, charts, and reference material, then this is the book for you."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"I made the mistake of buying another HDTV without really trying it out in the store. I quickly realized that there were several features that I really wanted that it didn't have. So, I returned it, did a bunch more shopping and HW and got the C32V37. This is the only HDTV in the price range that allows you to zoom into the center of the picture rather than just stretch a 16:9 to a 4:3 (I hate when the people get tall and skinny).This TV has just about every feature you could want and is pretty easy to use. Definately the best in the price class. Only complaint is that the colors can be a little tricky to tune in to where people don't look funky. But, stick with it and the rewards are worth it!"
5,Great Picture,This has a great picture and I loved it. I gave it to my mother and she refuses to leave her couch. Beware it's heavy!
1,awful print,"If you're looking for an accurate representation of what the original ""Old Guitarist"" looks like, this is not it. The original is a wonderful piece of artwork and this print looks as if they ramped up the contrast in a bad way. ugly and horrible. i'm very disappointed in what I received."
3,"It works, nothing more","It does what it says it will for a reasonable price. According to AverMedia tech support, it only captures with NeoDVD, which is lacking in many options, like lightening the input. Windows Movie Maker 2 on XP Pro works, but captures in low res-only. Nero won't work at all.NeoDVD files are MPG2, but are pretty large still. The TV tuner works, but the audio is poor when playing back a recording."
2,Way too short to be practical.,The length of the handle is so short that it prevented me from using the brush on a hot grill without a separate grill glove that i was then forced to buy. While brass may be the required abrasive to clean certain grates the short handle of the brush makes it impractical. Skip the Libman and buy a longer one.
3,works,what can I say it ships fast. was what I expected. we will see if it lasts through the summer BBQ season.
3,Grill Brush,"The bristles come off too easily and I have to wipe down the grill with a paper towel to make sure the wires aren't on the cooking surface. It works okay, but doesn't remove the harder residue."
3,brass grill brush,"The grill starts to shed after the 4th grill cleaning, so be careful. The brush does what it says for ceramic grills."
3,Smaller and flimsier than I expected,"Here in Hawaii, it can be hard to find things. Specialized school supplies are only available for about a month, and then you're out of luck for another year. So when my daughter was asked to get a plastic, velcro closure envelope in the 2nd month of school, I couldn't get one on the island anymore. I have purchased locally something similar in the past and was hoping this would be the same. It wasn't.I don't think this envelope is the size stated in the product description. I think it is maybe 9x12. I bought it to hold a composition book and it wasn't big enough. The plastic is thin and flimsy. I don't think it would have held up to being carried back and forth to school.Instead, it is now an expensive envelope for origami paper."
5,I loved everything about this book!,"The book, The Diary of a Teenage Girl has to be one of my favorite books ever. Every page is filled with great reading, never a 'dull moment'. For myself, (being only 14) i wanted to read something i could relate to, something more mature than your everyday teen books. This was certainly the read for me. After reading it I lent it to my best friend who loved it as well. This book, for me, was almost showing myself (to an extent) and it showed me that I'm not the only teen that notices simple things about well, life. This book is wonderfully written and its basically a story of a 15-year old girl trying to find herself. Like I said earlier, I loved this book, and I hope you do too!"
5,"The other side of Tales of The City, 1970's San Francisco","Gloeckner, author of graphic novel A Child's Life, has told this tale that is graphic in both format and content, ostensibly about her own teen-hood in the 1970's - the other side of the lighthearted Tales of the City series - that she lived to tell about, 25 years later. Both graphic novel and diary, the book allows you to dive into this gritty yet somehow beautiful slice of life, the world of 15-year old Minnie Goetz, and see the humor and hope embedded within the anger and recounting of grim experiences. Gloeckner's comics are well drawn and explosive, and anyone who has lived in or been to San Francisco will appreciate her representational cityscapes (Polk St., Cliff House) that surround her daily happenings, combined with the awe and wonder that Minnie conveys as she grows into womanhood."
2,too wallowy for my tastes,"I didn't particularly like this but was impressed with Gloeckner's multi-modal storytelling. Other than that it's rocking a sort of Heather Lewis ""House Rules"" ""how bad will it get and how nasty can I tell it"" vibe. Wierdly and sordidly shallow content. I know I am probably expected to feel something for this narrator, but I don't. I hardly look at the book anymore. Now, Jessica Abel's ""La Perdida"", I do pick up from time to time."
4,"Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing. And good.","When I purchased this 4 years ago, I was more interested in the pictures part than the words (read: I thought this a graphic novel).It's more book than comic, however (85% and 15% respectively), and the things that happen to the protagonist, Minnie, are just incredibly jarring at times.It's a testament to Gloeckner's writing that she can so accurately portray the mindset of a 15-year old. Unfortunately, like most 15-year olds, there isn't much insight: nothing particularly profound, just a series of events and the protagonist's reactions to them.I would recommend this if you're looking for a character study, have an interest in the 1970s counterculture, or just want to read a hyper dysfunctional coming-of-age tale.Personally, I would probably opt for a stronger piece of creative non-fiction, fiction, or graphic novel instead of this (unique) book."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"As far as fictional diaries go, this wasn't the worst. Although it's gritty and honest, it just seems to be lacking in any real emotion."
4,A Great Book,"You feel for Minnie. Gloeckner has succeded in capturing those years of teenagerdom where you can successfully ignore your head because the world must be okay. You will cry for Minnie's blindness to the faults of those around her and adore her for her attempts to let everyone be good. Minnie is a real picture of the mental state of teenagers (even if her actions are less restrained by family than most), and once you pick up this book, you will want nothing more than for her to turn out allright."
5,Reason for Treason,This well-written book evokes thankfulness for freedoms that we sometimes take for granted. It is easy to see that the author of this book had a higher calling than self.
3,great shape not too strong,great shape and size (nice big pumpkin but not overly strong). _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
2,Forma facil de entender el ingles,"Me agrada mucho este libro por que me explica en español cual es las garmatica en ingles, y cual es su forma en español. Asi es facil saber cuando como usar los tiempor y usos del inglesGracias"
2,RV & Tent Campgrounds,Does not cover as many campgrounds as the trailer life directory. However it does give a little more info on the campgrounds it does list.
4,Overall a good book,"The shear volume of information makes this difficult to keep accurate but we found it mostly accurate. My partner and I took a cross country road trip from Chicago to Seattle and used the book to find camp sites along our route. The amenity descriptions can be a bit generous in some cases but mostly accurate. We were on the road for more than 4 weeks and I can honestly say that we enjoyed each park we stayed at, found the descriptions accurate and came across some destinations we would never had found ourselves. I can see where peoples comments about it being essential for a RV parking are true. As tent campers, we really didn't have a lot of trouble finding places but some RV parks filled quickly. Definitely use it to make reservations as the process for pulling in and setting up is much easier."
2,Nothing really new or exciting here...moving on,"There really isn't anything new here, and many of the long boarders are shown riding short boards. I'm all for versatility, but when I buy a long boarding video, I can care less about short boarding. In fact, its contrary to the title and the subject matter, i.e long board surfing. The footage is OK, theirs better videos depicting all the spots expect for Salani's and the other spots in Samoa. I used to live in Am. Samoa and have been to Samoa many times, so it was nice to see those waves in action and to hear these surfers talk about how shallow and heavy the waves are.Nonetheless, its not worth the money I paid for it, maybe half. Interestingly enough, even though the video was released in 2007, their is footage from the 1990's...go figure."
4,"If you Longboard, you will enjoy this one!","A great travel flick that shows you longboard surfing around the world with some of the best in the business. Robert August, Dave Kalama, and ""Wingnut"" just to mention a few. Great music that goes with the different chapters and locations shot. A great view and a perfect way to help you ""Keep the Glide Alive""."
5,Fantastic!,"There are stories telling with the fingers, with gloves (Ms.fox), with milkboxes (A mysterious house,Doggie policeman,Wide-mouth frog, Frog cakes (they jump!)), puppets in felt (Squeak!Squeak!Squeak!) and even with tissue boxes (My mommy is gone).The origami is present too (origami mice, I wish today was my birthday!, What kind of egg is this?, Rain hat, Mountain climbing). We are learning too to make a mini-book (Crab's persimmons). There is a draw and tell story (Turkey lake) and another with handkerchiefs. The last story need 18 sheets! It's fantastic!"
1,AVOID: DOA-Go with another brand,"Brand new 500GB USB 2.0 d2 extreme drive (not sure if this is the exact model here), brought it home today, opened the box, plugged it in, and nothing, no sound, no start up, just the power light flashing. Took it right back and bought the new WD My Book 400GB, and it has a fan, thank god. These LaCie's cook. Avoid unless you like to waste your money. 0 stars if allowed, since it was brand new and busted."
2,"Nice Frame, Bad Hardware","I love the way this frame looks and it was easy to get my pictures into it. But the hook that came on the back was very cheap and actually came off immediately. I put pictures in this frame and gave it to my mother, but it is still not hung up because there is no way to hang it! I guess I'll get around to buying some new hardware so I can hang it up, but why should I have to do that when the hardware is included in the price of the frame? Poor attention to detail made this a not-so-great buy."
3,Horizontal or Vertical,"I purchased this frame because I wanted one that would hold the pictures of my 3 boys vertically(up and down the wall). It does that great, however after a period of time because I have now had the frame a year the wood is warping and the frame is slightly crooked. However I cannot find another frame like this anywhere so for that I like it and I will continue to use it."
1,"This is a joke, right?","...These guys are, like, Spinal Tap, right? I mean, this is SUPPOSED to be funny, right?...right?"
5,NOS DEMUESTRA QUE,"TENER UN HIJO ES ALGO TAN GRANDE COMO EL MEJOR ACTO DE MAGIA! Realmente, ahora que contamos con instrumentos de alta tecnología,podemos ver el desarrollo del bebé en el vientre de su madre: Cómo empieza a latir ese corazoncito y aparece el cerebro, los pulmomnes...¡Todo!Este libro nos deja sin ninguna duda respecto a los cuestionamientos que nos hacemos los padres durante el embarazo, y lo hace con sencillez y conocimiento de causa. De veras, NO SE LO PIERDAN si van a tener un bebé...aunque sea el segundo o el tercero. También encontrarán cosas nuevas que no supieron la primera vez y coincidirán en que el embarazo es un milagro que Dios nos regaló !"
5,Wonderful Just Wonderful Great Wedding Shower gift Idea TOO,"How I wished someone would have given me this book when I faced the idea that I was pregnant YIKES..so now I recommend it as a wonderful wedding gift to that couple who plans on having a family. It is a real source of information and comfort. I had the surprise too the day I went to deliver, I had to have an emergency C-section. This is a great gift too for that bold woman who may choose to under go having a child as a single parent. From conception right down to explaining the Post Partum Depression. Awesome Book."
2,cheaply built and no repair parts available,"This toy is great fun, but is so cheaply built, and poorly engineered that the wheels fall off with little provocation rendering it useless. The axle connector on the left side wheels are soft and crack with just a little normal play. My son was very dissapointed, as was I ($20 down the drain) and contacting the manufacturer proved fruitless.We actually got two of these trucks (GraveDigger and Superman) and BOTH are now broken. The toy was hardly used, but the weak/soft plastic did it in."
2,poor durability,I bought this for my Grandson. He had it less than 24 hours and the rear wheel was broken off. Truck has a very thin plastic rear axle connection. I don't recommend this product if you are looking for something that will last.
2,Super Stomper,Less than 48 hours it is broke the back wheel is broken.It is a waste of money to buy.My son is very upset over his birthday gift that was fun for a day and then it is broke and the only thinkg left to do is throw it away with the box.Do not waste your money on this toy.
1,Keep Shopping,"We have Big Monster Jam fans and this was a HUGE Disappointment as it fell apart after the 1st jump. You are better off buying one of the 1:24 scale trucks which is slightly smaller, but much more durable and has many varieties. Good luck!"
5,21 Month old loves it!,"My 20 month old son LOVES this toy. He is able to step on it and make the truck go about 5 ft by himself. He loves it even more when we stomp on it and make it go racing across the room!It does seem very light and would probably be easy to break, but our son only plays with it when we are with him. Not that he isn't able, it's that it isn't rated for a 1-2 year old."
1,Management as Myth,"To use MacArthur as a management model is a corruption of the term. What next, Risk Management by Admiral Kimmel and General Short. The writers of this book obviously have never reviewed the General's career and his actions. Since when as megalomania, persecution complex and wishful thinking been part of a managers curriculum?From the pathetic lack of preparation against air strikes in the Phillipines, despite having adequate warning, to the woeful disregard of Chinese intentions in Korea this mans record was spotty at best. Other men died to keep his ego alive.There are better books with much better and more deserving role models."
5,The Architecture of All Abundance,"This book is a must read. Ms Carroll's unique thought process and unswerving values are apparent throughout the book. I have never read a book which so thoroughly entertained me and inspired me while providing me with concrete, practical ways of approaching life that are effective and paradigm-shifting.I especially like the fresh way the book is laid out. It provided breaks in the material which allowed me to easily digest all the rich content. This book is for everyone who longs to have a more peaceful, creative, effective and dynamic life."
2,not the item shown,"These glove liners just arrived, so I haven't been able to use them yet. I will add to this review later when I've used them as designed.But I wanted to say that the liners that came today are not the ones in the photo. They are a completely different product. They were very cheap, so I won't waste my time with a return, but just keep this in mind if you decide to order."
5,Love It!,"I don't really drive like a ""psycho,"" but I have to say that I have a better grip on my steering wheel with this cover."
2,"It's cute, but didn't fit.","I'm a little bummed. I got this in the mail and followed the instructions...but apparently, my steering wheel is an inch too big...so it didn't fit. I really wish it would've fit because I love it."
1,Hmmmm.....,"Most of the time I just pass stuff like this up, but after buying and reading the book I just have one question to ask.Oh God!: A White Woman's Guide to Sex and Spirituality. When will it be released???Oh, but we we ALL know the day will never come where a book with a title as such will be printed and accepted as this book has.Just something I was thinking about while reading this book."
1,Not Fair,Why should people be able to name a book a BLACK woman's guide and we are not able to call it racist? How is that equality? When will the day come when we are just WOMEN as one! JUST WOMEN!
5,About Time,"There is no reason you can't be a spiritual and sexual being. These things are not mutually exclusive so it's about time someone pointed it out. Thank you to Susan Newman for writing an honest book that speaks to women who are often told it's wrong to experience sexual feelings if they are true Christians. If I remember correctly, one of God's first directives to Adam and Eve was to ""be fruitful and multiply."" God doesn't place a ban on sex, men do for their own reasons and women fall prey to the belief that sex is sinful. It is a perfectly natural impulse and a beautiful thing to share with someone you love. Hallelujah! Free at last! A thinking, feeling woman's guide to wholeness and fulfillment."
1,Susan Newman: ADVOCATE FOR SATAN!,"Ms. Newman's book is horrible!! Don't let the title fool you! She's using the word of God and spirituality to decieve women, black women in particular, into thinking that sex before marriage is all good!"
3,Average Effort by Author,"This is more the wrong book. Ok the story was not that bad, it moves fast and there is a lot of action, but it is a little thin. The author did not spend enough quality time working on the characters, why they did what the did etc. If you read a number of books in the genre you were guessing the end of the book about a quarter of the way in. The author really tries to get a Clancy type converging subplot structure but it seems forced, it almost aggravated me with the hard cuts from one to the next. There is not a lot of subtly in this book. It does provide a story that is at least average."
3,Good idea but could have been executed better.,This case has a hard plastic? end secured to the camera and a soft neoprene cover that unzips and hangs under the camera.Pros:The quick release cover concept works wellThe cover stays out of the picture at almost any angleThe secured end of the case adds needed gripTripod mount still usable with the case onCons:The plastic? and neoprene surfaces look odd together and the colors don't match wellThe cover doesnt full enclose the cameraThe case must be removed entirely to access batteries or ports
4,The actual wayn to real education reforms,"An interesting wide-minded book. The authors ask the great frustration question: Why all the educational reforms did`nt success in the American`s schools? Their conclusion are: ""To reform our schools we need not only new programs but a new vision of education itself"". The authors take example from the american industry, and call for holistic work:""A process of research, development, and redesign can build into schools as the framework for a system of continuous innovation"". The book readable and interesting - despite the long descriptions of the cases: educationals and industerials."
5,"A very solid album, with very high peaks","Listen to ""The Seagull/The Bay Day"", and you will know what this disk has to offer: beautiful arrangements of great tunes, tracks that you will be playing over and over and over again. This tune is so beautiful that when the CD player hits it, you'll enter a whole new world. Then spin ""The Ramblin Barber"", an Ornette Coleman tune, which absolutely smokes. ""Lady Hamilton"" will satisfy your old-time bone, and the rest of the tunes round out a great effort. I can't wait until the next offering from these master musicians."
4,SEASON 13,I HAVE ALL OF SVU IT JUST GET'S BETTER EVERY YEAR I LIKE THE TWO NEW ACTORS DANNY PINO AND KELLI GIDDISH THERE STARTING TO FIT IN THE SHOW I REALLY MISS (STABLER)CHRISTOPHER MELONI HE'S BEEN IN SO LONG AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S GONE WHAT'S HE UPTO NOW IF ANYONE KNOW'S 13 IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE REST.
3,"Without Meloni, this show is a lot weaker","Although season 13 had some good episodes, the show has lost a step without actor Christopher Meloni. I fear it won't be long before the show is cancelled."
5,Law & order svu season 13,Great revamp of the long running show law & order svu season 13 new actors and cliffhanger at the ende new stores riped from the headlines well writen ie would recamend the 13th seaon to lovers
2,NBC Dropped The Ball,Great T.V ShowONE COMPLAINT ''HOW COULD YOU LET MELONI GO?''ARE THE EXCECS CRAZY NO WONDER NBC SUCKS LETTING HIM WALK I DON'T THINK THE SHOW WILL LAST A LOT WITHOUT HIM.YOU CAN'T HAVE A PB&J; WITHOUT THE JELLY
1,Que lástima,"Ya no editan con subtítulos en español Los capítulos 12 y 13. ¿Por qué?Hemos comprado del 1 al 12. ,¡que lástima!"
5,Sissy Bar Bag,Great looking bag! It seem to be made well. Large and holds a lot. It matches great with my saddlebags. Service was great as usual. Shipment was fast.
4,Nice bag for the price,"This is a nice bag. It isn't sealed so water could probably get into the compartment, but the exterior is water resistant. I hit it with some 303 fabric guard to make sure it was water repellant. The bag is just large enough to fit my briefcase on those days I drive the bike to work. It has wide velcro straps to hold it to the sissy bar. I use a bungee cord to extra secure it. Easy to mount and remove. The back straps have plastic clips; the side straps are not clips but actual buckles. I forgot to buckle one of the side straps and it flew off on the freeway, so make sure you have them buckled. Recommended."
1,Helped me remember!,I was appalled at the language and immoral chatter of what is considered as comedy today. Can't anyone make people laugh without being vulgar. In my early years I was entertained by good clean humor by people who had a real talent.
1,Don't recommend,It is only a sampler so my rating could be higher but I wouldn't get it again nor recommend it.
4,Best fitness,"This is not a video for someone who wants to be a SEAL groupie. Get other videos for this. What this video is excellent for is building fitness and strength without any weights. The exercises combines strength, endurance and flexability into one workout. Doing this workout will not teach you about the SEALs, what it will show you is how to attain fitness levels that are sufficient for any military service, for special forces you would be better completing the burnout video, the second one in the series. If you want to run a marathon or triathalon, complete the third video the Deathwish PT and you will be one of the fittest individuals around.I subtracted on star for the missed reps of some of the stretches and the poor production quality. If you want a vido that is more polish than fitness, dont buy this. This video is pure PT and only for the strong willed, better than any of the fitness books or videos available."
2,Poor production quality!,This video was a waste of money unless you want a good laugh. The workouts are not advanced and are the same workouts that any military personnel does. Get Stewart Smith's book if you really want the Navy Seal Workout.
1,Why so expensive?,"You can get the same thing, brand new, off of Ebay for $39.99 or less if you want to bid. I came to Amazon hoping for a better deal."
5,Love for the office,This is how it all starts and I love every episode! I planned to watch a couple episodes at a time and I watched both seasons straight!
5,Dwight Schrute is the greatest!!!,"The Office is the funniest show on tv. The jokes Jim plays on Dwight are priceless. Steve Carell is the best at dry humor. There are tons of deleted scenes and outtakes. Season 1 is only six episodes, but it is well worth it."
1,lower the price,How do you expect to sell this product for $499.99 when there is one that is brand new not even opened for sale that is $79.00?
5,Season 1 and Season 2 DVD The Office,Everything about The Office DVDs is hilarious. I watch at least one episode everyday. I can't get enough of them. If you need to laugh just watch The office
5,"Once you get into it, it's pure gold.","I saw a few snippets of episodes on TV and wasn't too terribly impressed. Upon watching the series from the beginning, however, I was hooked. Now, having watched all 3 seasons on DVD I must say that this is one of the smartest, funniest, and above all re-watchable TV series out there. If you've ever worked for ""The Man,"" I'd highly recommend you purchase The Office."
4,The US series has hit its stride,"I am an enormous fan of the original UK series and wasn't impressed with my first viewing of the US adaptation. But in the second season, the series found its own voice with clever writing and superb ensemble acting. And I greatly appreciate them omitting a laugh track and letting us provide our own. I look forward to season 3 on DVD for the extras and to season 4 on TV for the ongoing story lines. If you loved the original, but have avoided the adaptation, give it another shot. You can enjoy them both."
5,Granny Quilt Decor,"I usually find that whenever I purchase a book such as this there will be one, maybe two, projects that strike my fancy and would like to try and the rest is just a waste. Not so with this one! I really do not know which one to start first. I shared it with my daughter who fell in love with it as well so I'm thinkin'...........Christmas present?.......Birthday present?...........""Just because"" present??"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTD WITH THIS DVD. BEING IT CAME OUT IN 2012 I THOUGHT IT WAS NEW EXERCISES ETC. I HAVE PROBABLY 20 DVDS BY LESLIE SANSONE. I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH ALL OF THEM. EACH NEW ONE ADDED NEW MOVES, NEW SETS, NEW STEPS, NEW MUSIC, AND DIFFERENT CHARACTERS, WHICH WAS MOTIVATING. THIS DVD WAS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED SEGMENTS FROM YEARS AGO AND TOTALLY UNINSPIRING. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADVERTISED BEFORE PURCHASED! ONE GOOD FEATURE OF A PREVIOUS DVD WAS THE CLOCK. I REALLY LIKED THAT. IN THE FUTURE, MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR LESLIE'S DVDS TO HIT THE LOCAL STORES SO I FULLY REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASING."
2,Not her best,"Not her best. I chose this one because each work out is set up with warm up, exercise, cool down, per work out - not with the warm up and cool down separate like her new work outs seem to be set up. It seems that her having everything in one work out saves time, that is why I chose this. These work outs just really did not impress me and I am very glad this was not my introduction to her. I was going to purchase this one for a friend to introduce my friend to her but purchased for myself first - good thing! I will not be purchasing this one for my friend.Her other work outs are great!"
4,Good DVD,"I began using Leslie's walking DVDs about a year ago, I was first introduced to one through a fitness offering at my place of employment. I have about 5 of her DVDs, find them all pretty much the same because they are all based on the same steps. I love that she incorporates upper body movements too. I feel I get a really good workout, and if working out on my own I tend not to do much of a warm up or cool down, but I do when using one of her DVDs. I like all of her talking, it is a good distraction.The one thing I have always been curious about is whey she always references 4 basic steps when in fact there are 5, but she doesn't seem to count the leg/hamstring curl as on of the steps.If I could change one thing it would be the music, there is so much excellent classic rock that could be used."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I love Leslie and her videos. I have several and I was looking for something to just change up my exercise routine. I don't mind the repetition in steps but this was extremely hard to follow. I'm surprised it got Leslie's, and her company, approval for release. The video itself was very cut up. The steps of the 2 mile walk, and the other walkers, was hard to follow. I'll continue to use some of my other videos but I would not recommend this one. I'm glad it wasn't my first experience with a Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds."
2,"Oldies, but not goodies!","I love Leslie Sansone's workouts, but I have to give a bad review for this collection. These are very old, grainy workouts. She took some of her cruddiest workouts, (that she probably couldn't sell on their own) & bundled them all together! The 2 mile fitness walk is the most pathetic out of the collection. The background is draped with material that looks like it belongs in a store remodeling construction area. The music is so low you can hardly hear it. Leslie talks even more than usual! The Evening Mile workout looks like it was made in the 80's. The floor has a very weird and distracting geometric grid pattern & there are peach colored Greek style columns in the background. The rest of the workouts are mediocre, so I gave the set 2 stars rather than 1. I wish Leslie's older DVD's were clearly labeled. I'm getting to the point where I'm afraid to buy any of her workouts anymore. This isn't the first time she's repackaged older workouts."
2,PROGRAMMING PRERELEASED,"ALTHOUGH I LOVE lESLIE SANSONE, THIS NEW DVD IS NOT NEW AT ALL. IN VERY SMALL PRINT ON THE BACK OF THE DVD CASE, THERE IS A DISCLAIMER THAT ""ALL PROGRAMMING WAS PRERELEASED"". THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADVERTISED AS A COMPILATION OF OLD VIDEOS NOT HER LATEST VIDEO."
2,All old workouts - not a lot of intensity,"I LOVE Leslie Sansone, but like a previous reviewer, I was expecting new workouts. These are all VERY old, not very intense and pretty cheesy. Her newer workouts are much, much better."
2,Disappointed,"Cant offer too much more other than what has been said.The DVD consists of old content. Even if a buyer hasn't seen these specifically,, the content is very basic and more or less screams older production. Walking portions aren't very exerting or strenuous for a more experienced walker of Leslie's programs. Toning sessions are ok, but overwhelmingly lackluster and not very challenging (and, again, the DVD production is aged).The DVD is probably suitable for folks just starting out with Leslie Sansone's walking programs or for those folks just starting to exercise, but it's not worth the expense for intermediate+ folks, and it's not worth even using on a lighter workout day."
1,Worst Workout DVD by Leslie I own,I love Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs and own an extensive collection. I purchased this DVD in August but did not try it until today. I was so DISAPPOINTED. I had to wait 3 minutes for the DVD to finish playing the GAIAM commercial before the workouts would load. Anytime I tried to fast forward through the commercial or load the main menu I was told 'this feature not allowed!'. I would rather spend my workout time working out - not watching commercials. I also waited too long to try the DVD so I cannot return it - but I certainly would if I could. This DVD isn't even good enough to give to someone else.
2,Unit Histories of the United States Air Forces,"I was very disappointed in this book, simply because the title led me to expect something entirely different. I need, and expected, a brief synopsis of histories of all significant units, i.e., groups, squadrons, etc, in the USAS, USAAF, and USAF. Something similar to ""Squadron Histories of the RFC, RNAS, & RAF since 1912"" by Peter Lewis, which contains exactly that. However, this book does not contain histories. It contains a bibliography of such histories, if they happen to have been published. I feel that the subtitle on page 57, ""A Guide to Documentary Sources"" is a much more accurate depiction of what this book has to offer. As such, it was totally insufficient for my needs, although as a guide for research on the title subject, it might well prove excellent."
2,Unit Histories of the United States Air Forces,"I was very disappointed in this book, simply because the title led me to expect something entirely different. I need, and expected, a brief synopsis of histories of all significant units, i.e., groups, squadrons, etc, in the USAS, USAAF, and USAF. Something similar to ""Squadron Histories of the RFC, RNAS, & RAF since 1912"" by Peter Lewis, which contains exactly that. However, this book does not contain histories. It contains a bibliography of such histories, if they happen to have been published. I feel that the subtitle to the second section, on page 57, ""A Guide to Documentary Sources"" is a much more accurate depiction of what this book has to offer. As such, it was totally insufficient for my needs, although as a guide for research on the title subject, it might well prove excellent."
1,Stick with Crayola!,"We have this seemingly awesome collection of crayons from Alex. Mt girls were so excited to receive them. They are really into coloring and who doesn't love a brand new set of crayons? Other Alex products have never disappointed me, but these are awful. They break. They do not color true to color. There are repetitive colors so not nearly 100 different ones. They color like very cheap crayons and we ended up getting rid of the set. Too bad. A great, fun concept gone terrible wrong with sub-par product. Stick with trusty Crayola and save your money!"
1,Love them lollipops but,For the price they could have thrown in a container the lollipops came in a plastic bag!?!?! for the price a 99 cent container could have been added without the company losing much money
3,Mini pops needs to be stated,"Yes, these are Chupa chups. In my opinion the best tasting lollipops I've found in a long time. Several ""creamy"" varieties along with the more traditional. My favorite being the choco-vanilla. However, these are ""mini-pops"". These are half, if not less than half, of the size of the normal chupa chups. This fact needs to be stated in the description. Not stating it is a bit deceptive. Great lollipop, but I guess I'll have to find another source next time. Sorry."
4,Loud but good,I've used hot air brushes for a couple years. This works better than my last. The low setting and the larger brush works better for me. The high setting blows the hair off the bristles. It's nice having the small brush option for different styles though. I believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron.
1,hot air brush bad ergonomically,I was trying to duplicate a device which my hairdresser used when I went for a cut/styling. The handle on the this product is way too large which makes it difficult to hold and manipulate. Also the diameter given for the brush is misleading. It is bigger than represented. It's difficult to get out of the packing (you need to cut the thing apart with a saw blade) which makes returning the item nearly impossible. I think I will ask my hairdresser if she can order one for me which is sized to fit a woman's hand. This is a good idea made bad because of poor design. Don't buy it!
2,Conair Hair Dryer,"This is like the 4th one I have bought for my wife. The problem with it is after about 6 months to a year the middle speed/dryer switch position burns out. I finally took apart the last one to see what exactly is happening. The switch position just slowly looses its contact so it will not operate on that setting. So then she gets mad, throws it out and buys a new one. She likes the way it feels, heats, etc. So based on our experience if you want to keep buying them over and over ... you get the picture."
2,Not Recommended,"I bought this item based on all of the positive reviews. Problems I found: Brush gets extremely hot, is difficult to hold (handle is big), and at 1,000 watts not powerful enough to dry by itself for thicker hair. I am returning and buying a regular hair dryer."
4,Good,Delivery was quick. Item was wrapped to perfection. The item was brand new in the original package. I have not used it yet. i will post another review after the first use.
5,"Easy to use, doesn't take up a lot of space.","I love this product, it is so much easier than trying to use a blow dryer and hair brush. Although it is not quite as powerful as regular hair dryer, a couple of additional passes through your hair will do the job."
3,Functionality,"Hard to hold, my fingers grip right where the control buttons are, turning it from low to high or even off. Once I adjust for this, it seems to work fine, giving my hair the shape and body it needs, but it ends up being too time consuming."
2,Wish I Hadn't Purchased,"This does not work on my thick curly hair, i am left with a frizzy tangled mess. I wish i hadn't spent the money on this product."
2,Conair BC171CS Hot Air Brush,"Was really hoping that this would be great after reading the reviews, but was quite disappointed. I've got very fine hair so that could be part of the problem, but I've used other hot air brushes before and this one just really didn't compare. Was looking for added volume and unfortunately didn't get that at all. Can't say that I could recommend this purchase."
4,Good Hairstyler,"I purchased this because I was blow drying my hair, then using a 1-inch flat iron, and I was looking for a single tool to do both jobs. My hair is short, thin and slightly wavy. It comes with a 2nd brush attachment which is 3/4 inch. This size works best for me. I have been using this brush about 7 weeks and there is a learning curve to get the best out of this brush. It does get very hot so I usually start it with full power and then switch to the low speed. It probably takes about 5-minutes to do my hair. Some reviews mentioned the placement of the on/off switch made it easy to accidentally turn it off. Being aware this might happen, I have not had a problem. I wish the ceramic ion was on the barrel of the small brush, but it is only on the 1.25 inch brush. I am happy with it and would recommend it."
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this brush/dryer - it only tangles in my hair and does not produce the detangling or curling effects described. For me this product was a waste of money. I opened the package so cannot return. What is missing is sufficient heat to make the product effective enough to produce straightening and/or a slight curl on the ends. I used once and found this brand/style does not really detangle (actually the opposite) and left the ends of my hair nearly untouched. To be fair I should add I am African-American w/medium length hair so that may be a contributing cause of insufficient heat/poor detangling effect. Just saying.
2,"It was fanstastic, then it burnt me, and died.","I have very thick, long, curly hair. This dryer made it bone strait, and glossy in fifteen minutes. I loved it.I would use it four times a week, for five months. Then today it just died. I noticed the metal brush attachment would become very hot. I also burnt myself on the brush a few times, and would have to let it cool down by the sink, away from anything that could be flamable.If you have thick, long hair like me, this is probably not the strongest dryer for you. Go with something more heafty."
4,"Heats fast, but frizzyness...","The hair curling iron is great if you have thick, long unrully hair. It'll leave your hair frizzy if you don't know/learn how to manage the hair dryer, but other than that the hair dryer works perfectly. I have lots and thick hair, but it does its job if I'm patient..."
2,Awkward,"It looked interesting, being able to shape your hair while drying it. Perhaps saving an extra step. But it turned out to be very awkward. It didn't really curl hair well. The hair gets caught in the brush unless you are very meticulous about how you wind it up. Makes hair a little frizzy. I would return it except it wouldn't be worth paying the extra shipping. I am getting surgery on my right arm and won't be able to use my arm, so I will hang on to this as it will at least brush my hair and dry it, slowly, with one hand."
2,African woman with thick coarse hair,"well...this product is not gonna get my hair straight. it does nothing for me. doesn't get that hot. its only 1000watts. if ur black, and u want hotter heat to straighten ur hair, look at Revlon 1500watts. or try to find something hotter than that. more watts.. but ive searched and searched and hottest ive found is 1500. if you need a blow dryer, look at the 1875watts. i got the vidal sasson and i love it. if u need a root straightner, look at Babyliss root straightener it gets as hot as 450. good for our hair.you know we need the hotter the better for our hair...."
5,Awesome,"If I knew that this existed sooner, I would have bought one a long time ago! This thing is awesome. It does the job of three tools - a curling iron, a blowdryer and a brush."
4,Good for the price,For the price this is a very good product. Keeps the frizzies and fly aways in check and adds body and shine.
2,eliz.wny,"This product is not what I expected. 1. The diameter* of the handle is so big, it was difficult to hold and turn without accidently turning the on/off settings. *After seeing the product, I believe the handle is so large in diameter because the motor is in the handle. It also made it heavy to hold.2. The brushes were described as .75"" and 1.25"". However, that is the size of the cylinder, not the total width; they were too wide for short to medium length hair."
2,Fried my hair.,"Consider this thing to be as damaging as a flatiron, and use it accordingly. It should not be used on delicate hair on a daily basis."
4,i need more practice,I have never used a hot air brush before and will need more practice with it to become an expert. But I like not having to hold both a brush and a hair dryer to style my hair.
4,Good!,great to use for a quick fix up! i use it all the time! i love it! I use it for flips and waves and other different hair styles.
1,Unsafe: hair and fire don't mix!,"This was my first hot air brush, and it worked quite well for about two years. Then one day as I was using it, it shot sparks out the handle and tripped the GFI. Hoping it was a one-time event (maybe some hair had been sucked into the motor?), I continued to use it. Another week passed before the same thing happened again! My best guess is that torque builds up where the brush attaches to the main body when you use the brush, so something inside must be moving or getting compressed as you're brushing. I was sad to have to toss it, but hair and fire don't mix!"
2,Broken after 5 months,"I got this hair dryer on May, 2011. It's broken after 5 months. It only blows out cold air. I am disappointed."
3,Too big!,I returned item. I am sure it worked well. Easy to return. It was too big for my length of hair. The bristles made it too big fo rme to use.
3,awkward to use,"okay except for the bulky handle, which is anything but ergonomic and awkward to use. On/off switch also difficult to use."
3,Works Fine,Purchased this item for my wife -- replacement for same model which broke after about 5 years. Works just fine -- real selling point of this item is a natural brush which is far gentler on the hair than the metallic brushes usually included with hot air brushes.
3,"Okay, but not as good as Revlon","I purchased this hot air brush after having two Revlon hot airbrushes that died after a year of use. However, this brush only has one temp setting (compared to Revlon's three) and leaves my hair frizzy instead of smooth curls. Not impressed."
5,excellent!,"i love this product. perfect. do its job and its not too expensive.a must have!, even for a beginner in the ''doing yourself hair'' like me."
1,not easy,"Thought this would solve the problem of blow drying the ""bob"". It is too hard to handle simply because the handle is too fat and clumsy. The hair gets tangled in the brushes. Turned into an expensive blow dryer."
5,campmom,"I have used a brush air dryer for many years and was always satisfied, but this ionic one has the most power of any I have used. The reviews are accurate: if you have very short fine hair, you may not get the curl you are looking for. I have extremely curly hair and am always looking for ways to tame it and release some of the curl. This hot air brush does the job. The ionic part does help keep down the frizz and it is speedy. If your head is very sensitive, you may find that this is too hot for it.I have mostly used the larger brush attachment, it has a firmer grip on the hair. The smaller one has longer bristles that are also softer. I have not used the concentrator attachment, but I think it will be great for traveling, since I won't need to haul my big blow dryer along."
2,Air Brush by conair,"It was okay, not really what I wanted so I gave it to a friend that really liked it and worked great on her type and texure of hair."
3,Not what I expected,It dries fine but leaves my hair flat and full of static. I put in my guest bathroom and wentback to my old Revlon dryer and round brush!
5,Fantastic.,"Bought it for christmas for my SO. She was thrilled with it and uses it every day. Great quality, amazing price, quick shipping. Would do business again."
5,Best Hair Dryer Around,I always had trouble holding a brush in one hand and a dryer in the other. Now I have it all in one and it works great. Two sizes of brush for different parts of the head. Would buy again.
2,Ok,"I like this product becAuse it has 3 different attachments and has a strong motor. The only thing is it doesn't have a cool air option. Be cautious too in handling the attachments, they can get very hot and I learned the hard way. It does the job...not too thrilled about it though"
2,conair hair dryer/ curler,"I have very thick straight hair. i followed the instructions and my hair does not curl with this product. It is a fantastic hair dryer. It usually takes me 1 hour to dry my hair with a regular hair dryer, but this dryer gets my hair dry in 20 minutes, and it does not fry my hair."
2,Great concept - needs improvement,"It's nice that it comes with two brush options and a concentrator attachment - but for me there were some real cons:* The cord is really short; you need to have a plug in above the counter-height to make it the most user friendly - and I'm only 5' 3""* I was hoping to use this instead of a hairdryer and round brush, but your hair has to be almost dry to use this. Guess that's fine if you have long hair (as shown in the pictures), but it doesn't work well for shorter, fine hair that needs to be styled from the moment you start drying it or it will be stick straight.* The diameter of the handle is too big; it makes it cumbersome to use.* This is REALLY loud, much louder than other hairdryers I've had.This all could be due to the fact that it's not a high end brush/dryer; maybe you get what you pay for. Glad I got it on a Lightening Deal."
4,Nice hot air brush,"I would say that this is a wonderful product. It works well does what it is suppose to do. Amazon shipped it quick too, which is really nice because I was buying it for my mom. One thing that I didn't really like was how big the handle is. It's just a little harder to use when the handle is too big. Overall my mom loves it and uses it 4 times a week. I give it one star off because of the big handle, which was my mom's only complaint."
4,nice and convenient,"This product is very convenient and nice. I can now dry my hair in 5-10 mins. I prefer if it has a brush also, it will be perfect (that's why I rate it 4 instead of 5). However, its perfect for students and working mothers who need to make their hair without spending too much time."
2,Too darn hot!!!,"I should have listened to the previous reviewer who said the iron was too hot - only one setting and my hair was frizzed for a week! Maybe if it had another setting, lower, it would have been all right. I had to return it immediately. Could NOT use it. My hair is fine, and a lot of it. Maybe with different textured hair, it would be OK."
3,Not for me..,"I had to return this product, I was very unhappy with it..It did not do anything for my hair..."
2,Would not buy a rain shower,Shower head is too heavy for extension arm. Arm will not tighten at pivot points so head cannot be adjusted.Had to return item.
2,Imperfect Bloomsbury,"This is the only known surviving play by Woolf. Created for an informal gathering of friends, she makes fun of artistic pretensions. This edition also includes a helpful introduction and an early draft of the play. It is best read aloud, with some advance explanation to those who participate or listen. Two droll couples provide much of the humor: photographer Julia Cameron and her philosopher husband, along with actress Ellen Terry and her sculptor husband. Tennyson also appears. Act II, where Terry meets a young sailor, is rather dull, apart from the Porpoise. A must for Bloomsbury fanatics, but of little interest to general readers."
1,TWO OUT OF FOUR HAVE BEEN BAD OUT OF THE BOX,"As described, two out of four have been bad out of the box. Will need to contact Amazon Customer service to see what the path to return / exchange is."
4,Solid introduction to web front-end programming,"I really like O'Reilly's Dynamic HTML, but this book is good as well. This book is more of a step-by-step walkthrough of HTML, through XHTML, CSS, layout and at the end an introduction to Javascript. The text is somewhat terse, but it's workable. Screenshots are somewhat heavy, but you would expect that in a book about a visual medium like the web. Some coverage, like Javascript, is a little too light to be genuinely complete in comparison with books like Dynamic HTML. Overall, a solid introduction to HTML, XHTML and CSS."
4,Great teaching book,"Great introduction to front-end web programming using XHTML and CSS. It even gets into the nitty-gritty of SEO strategies, rating your site for child access, testing methods, and accessibility for the visually impaired. Also provides a good, although brief intro to JavaScript, database driven websites, and programming for mobile devices.Yes there is a lot of repetition and a bit of wandering back and forth across subjects, and yes it can be annoying. But most books in this genre are guilty of that. This one is no better nor worse than the others. Nice reference and appendix. Recommended."
3,Kindle Specific Review,"I agree with most of the reviews written about this book, its good not great in my personal opinion.But my advice is regarding the kindle version. The formatting is Terrible!! Whoever did this obviously just copied and pasted it because its all over the place.No effort was put into it whatsoever. You still get the message from the book but reading it is far from pleasant, text size varies A Lot! Lines don't align.Download the sample for yourself before you buy. I wish I had.Its just really really poor. And shame on whoever did this so called conversion. I realise its an older book, but come on at least put in some effort.I just have to ask did anyone proof read this before they put it up there?If you do want this book get a hard copy and steer clear of the kindle version"
3,Great Idea...,"...however, there are some problems in practice. You must use at least two 12 oz. bags of chocolate chips and 3/4 cup oil. We tried to use less, for a small group and there was not enough volume to flow correctly. That also means that as you use the fountain, you'll need to top it off a bunch. There is a lot of left-over chocolate, when it's time to turn off the fountain. It definitely dripped off the top tiers, no flowing walls of chocolate. (The motor doesn't turn the auger fast enough.) Finally, it was very difficult to clean. There are lots of nooks and crannies and the chocolate mix is also hard to remove because it is oily. It took me about 20 mins., lots of hot water, and a toothbrush to really get it clean. It's a fun thing to use, but because of the above issues, we won't use it too often."
1,disappointed,"I looked forward to receiving this product. When I used it, I was very disappointed. No matter how much I thinned the chocolate, it was not running smoothly nor evenly, although it was level. The chocolate continuted congealing. When I was finished (constant attendance to the chocolate) and poured the chocolate out, the plate was warm but not hot. I have sent the product back, and I am not sure if it is a faulty item, or if this is as hot as it gets. For me it didn't work and was frustrating."
2,Cheep but Fun,"I purchased this for my daughters 10th birthday. It was a lot of fun for all of us. However, as I was drying one of the many plastic pieces one sliped out of my hand and droped on my wood floor and broke. I called the company to find out about replacing the part. It cost $10 to replace the part and $10 to ship it. Nowhere else sold the part, and I could not pick up the part, so in the trash the whole unit went. It was not worth spending $20 on one part and storing it when I could have replaced it all for $25."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this from a department store to use for a girls night. It took me a little bit to get it level since the feet are adjustable but once I did, it worked great. We had it running for a few hours with no problems. I did find it a bit loud but Im not sure how it compares to other fountains as far as noise. Also, the base is a little difficult to clean but for 30 bucks its great."
3,Great for 1 1/2 hours...,"Pretty disappointed that it only works for an hour and a half until the chocolate starts getting cold and stops flowing. This happened both times I used it at exactly 1 1/2 hours. It doesn't feel as warm as when it starts and the chocolate starts getting clumpy and the motor starts working hard to keep it flowing. It is fun for the time it does run. The clean up is not fun either. I used milk chocolate chips with shortening, so maybe that could be part of it. However, the shortening makes it really hard to get clean."
5,good for parties and fund raisers,used this fountain at a fund raiser for a mission trip to Mexico. it was a hit with adults and kids alike. easy to use.
2,Didn't work,I bought this for my wedding reception. I don't know if the caterer didn't read the directions or what but it wouldn't work for nothin'.
1,A complete disappointment!,I was so disappointed by this product. It is quite wasteful: requires two 12 ounce packages of chocolate and then it requires at least 3/4 of OIL to be added to the chocolate (making it even more unhealthy!) to supposedly get it thin enough to work but I couldn't get it to work- it could never get thin enough and then it is quite difficult to clean (bowl doesn't separate). total waste...
1,beware for this item wrong advertisement,"i so upset when i recieved this item . amazon.com send me a wrong item i choose this because is astainless stell tier on picture and now i recieved plastic tier and easy to brake , thats y dont buy this item any more my fualt is i did no listen for all bad feedback for this item may god bless you amoxn for false advertising....Nostalgia CFF-965 Mini Chocolate Fondue Fountain with 2-Tier Tower take note stainless steel tier on sample picture"
2,"Couldn't get it to ""fountain""","I was pretty good about following instructions for this, but we couldn't get it to ""fountain"" no matter how much I tried to thin the chocolate. One one occasion, we used chips designed for fountains. On another, we used regular chips + oil. The second worked the best, but after a minute or two the chocolate seemed to cool and just got gloppy around the base.A bunch of fixit-minded people at the party took a look and had a spirited debate over whether 1) the heater wasn't warm enough, or 2) there were not enough intake points to bring the chocolate up into the tube (we found 1). So it did provide entertainment, and we could dip the chocolate out of the bottom, it just looked... well... not impressive. At all.This might work with something as thin as chocolate syrup. It worked when we tested it with water, too."
1,Wrong photograph,"This is false advertising. The picture in the listing is a Sephra brand , whereas the actual product is nostalgia, which is inferior to sephra!!Please change this picture"
1,Heating element no good,"Tried to use this as a cheese fountain, which the instructions do recommend, but the heating element that should have kept it warm and flowing never seemed to get hot enough to do anything and I just ended up with gobs of cheese covering the fountain but not really flowing. I don't know if mine was just broken out of box or if others have experienced this problem, but it was completely non functioning as it stands."
5,Piece of Chocolate,This was great. I used this for my Sons eagle scout ceremony and was a wonderful addition. The cord was a little shorter then I would have liked. It was well loved and will be used for the holiday season.
5,Does the job!,This surely is smaller then some may expect but its great for home use... I would not recemend getting this is if your looking to use it on a more regular basis with a larger amount of guests... no more then a typical accassional family use. It does the job!
4,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,Diana Krall's cover of Nat King Cole's Boulevard of Broken Dreams is sublime and worth the price of this CD.
4,A Smorgasbord of goodies,Like Lou Reed? Like Davie Bowie? Do you like variation in your music? This is the CD for you. Stark and Drury have mastered many sounds and rolled them up into one nice smorgasbord of goodies!
4,What is in this book?,"George Hutcheson is classic stuff and I am pleased to have several of his works. I was hoping to get some more commentary on the Book of Joel but was disappointed that Joel isn't covered in this work. What is in this book? Obadiah about 18 pages, Jonah 38 pages, Micah 110 pages, Nahum 33 pages, Habakkuk 62 pages, Zephaniah 48 pages. If you ae looking for material on the other 6 Minor Prophets look elsewhere."
2,Could be better,writter takes way too long to get to the point. Instead of liking the characters they become annoying.
2,Too small,"This is much smaller than it looks in the picture. It does not hold a lot of magazines. The only nice thing about it is ,it has a rack on the door to store magazines.No, I would not recommend this."
3,Better inspection needed!,"The tables look great and were just the size I needed but that company needs better inspectors. A piece of the back corner of one table, had a small crack. Since I had waited for the tables to get the room finished, I did my own repair and did not send it back. If the dammage had not been so small, I would have returned both tables and purchased somewhere else."
3,It's an OK read,"A Brief History of Ancient Greece is exactly that--brief. It is great for an overview of big events and people.There are definitely better books on Ancient Greece that one could buy. This was required for one of my college classes so I needed to buy it. It is definitely not an enjoyable read as it is not very well written and again, quite brief.I do recommend this book if you're looking for a general overview that doesn't go into much detail."
1,Hard to believe this is a Demy movie: BAD,"If you are a Demy fan like me, who loved Cherbourg and Demoiselles, do not spend money to see this awful, sordid little movie. It's not a musical, it's not a romance, just a boring tale of ships passing in the night. Amazon's welcome to my $15, but I sure wish I could have my 90 minutes back."
1,awful awful awful,"I bought this because of Spirit doing the music and appearing in the film. Without a doubt this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I've never seen such blaise performances. No wonder it had a limited release. Buy the soundtrack LP, forget the movie. There is absolutely no one likeable in it, esp to have been made in '68 in LA. I s'pose one could say it's interesting to see the LA strip in '68...but: Terrible. No wonder HAL took out Lockwood. Ha!"
1,Uh...What?,"Oh dear. Another direct-to-video cesspool destined for nothingness. I swear, I'm in the wrong business. If THIS can be made (and released), I need to borrow a camera, two people who can't act, and away we go. Supposedly a western, yet there's nary a horse in sight! Awful; just awful."
4,"Good product, love the 800mb Firewire interface","I've had this for a month now with no problems. I bought it because it had the 800mb firewire (1394b) interface which is noticeably faster than standard firewire/1394a. Product seems well built, my 320GB drive seems to be plenty cool, and there is no fan to go bad or be noisy. I like it. It was a little more expensive than I would have liked."
4,Good construction Easy to install the drive,As a small office/home office computer consultant I often install external drives as part of a back up and recovery system. One of my clients is a professional photographer who eats up drive space quickly - each RAW digital photo is often over 6 MB. Moving these large files around using USB 2 or Firewire 400 is not fast but still takes a good deal of time. Firewire 800 is perfect. At the time of this post the number of external 800 drives was not great - I only found a few. Most of them were twice as expensive as a USB 2.0 - Firewire 400 case.I was most impressed with the construction quality of the Macally USB 2.0 & Firewire 800. While many will not need such a high-end case it was perfect for my customer.
2,Firewire Ports failed over time,"A great unit while it worked. I used mine for backups once a month for a few hours. The first Firewire 800 port failed after about 18 months, the second after a couple of years.I would be more upset had I not recently switched to an eSATA enclosure."
2,ATA Hard drive Case,"It didn't stay here that long. It apparently was defective from the factory and I had to return it. Looks good, but just wasn't working for me. Amazon did a grat job though."
5,love this,"This color is the Bomb....as my teen ager would put it. I love love love this color. It's not a bright red, it has a slight pink to it and in the sun it is really pretty. I won't use any other color...."
4,color is not the same,"I know it's not the company's fault, but when I was buying this nail polish, I was expecting a much brighter color as shown on the picture. Instead, it is more of a muted raspberry color. I will keep it, but I was expecting something brighter."
2,doesn't match salon color,"After using this color in a nail salon and LOVING it, I wanted my own bottle. I ordered it via Amazon as it was quicker than waiting for the Salon to get it in stock. I was disappointed when it came because it was NOT the same color as the one in the salon, although the labels matched. The quality of the polish was fine. I was disappointed as I will not use this polish...it was significantly different from what I thought I was ordering."
5,love opi,"Great product, long lasting. I love the color. Lasts about 7 days for toenails and 3 for finger nails. Depends how many dishes you have to wash :)"
2,In a word- meh,"I purchased this hood for my Canon f/1.8 50mm lens as the Canon hood is expensive and had received shaky reviews. This hood does it's job, but is annoying to screw onto the filter threads and doesn't allow the lens to be capped while the hood is in place."
1,They really spent no time on this release.,"So if you're not going to invest any time into a release, why even bother? The DVD that was previously released a few years ago actually had a decent amount of special features. This release? Not ONE. NOTHING. They couldn't even put those on this release? The only thing that the BluRay did better is spell Dedee Pfeiffer's name correctly on the front cover.If you want just the movie, this would be fine for you. If you want a decent release with some really cool special features, try to track down the original DVD release, or if you already have it, don't bother ""upgrading""..."
1,Not worthy to be classified as a Blu-Ray edition,"I purchased this Blue Ray edition hoping it has a better transfer. Not at all. The movie lacks any special features and the transfer is VERY BAD. Even a video cassette would look better as the images are grainy and colors fade. I don't know why movie studios care to release such a BAD product hoping to take advantage of fans who wanted a better looking product. You don't need it, better buy it on DVD and there will be NO difference among both versions."
5,Excellent Unbiased Introduction to Belize,"The Belize Adapter Kit will not disappoint you. Whether you are a first-time visitor to Belize or a seasoned traveler considering permanent residence, you will find a great deal of helpful information here. Mr. Sluder has managed to create a guide that is as useful to the novice as it is to those with significant knowledge about the country.You will learn the pros and cons of life in Belize and gain a respect for the practical aspects of living and traveling in the country. This is not a romanticized look at a tropical paradise, but an unbiased and truthful guide to daily life in a place that may inspire you - or frustrate you.If you wish to know whether you should consider relocation to this remarkable country, the Belize Adapter Kit will be an invaluable resource. It is also extremely useful to those considering a vacation here."
2,A disappointment,"Based on the title, I had been hoping for something different, but found this little more than a glorified Tour Guide. Much of the information is the type shown in your standard Tourist Brochure or website, and I thought the overall tone a bit condescending.A much better book for these purposes is ""Inside Belize"" by Tom Barry. It offers a well researched, in-depth view of the Belize economy, politics and culture."
3,Works well,"But I got it for my 88 year old mother and she isn't able to figure it out, unfortunately. We're still trying"
3,QA Problem,"Product was easy to set up and use, but had trouble with spacebar. Discovered one of the switches under the spacebar was broken. Had to pay shipping to have it fixed. Also couldn't get a rebate on the access fee for the two weeks the Mailbug was in the shop. Haven't had any problems since, but don't know if the manufacturer has a quality assurance problem at the factory, or if the product's going to have persistant reliability problems.If it continues to work reliably I would give it 5 stars vs what it was advertised to do. If it breaks again within a year I wouldn't give it any stars."
4,Landel a good replacement for mymailstation,"My 90 year old Mother had a mymailstation for over 10 years but the equipment and support had declined over time. It is key that the gift giver (children) to set up the mailbug before giving it to the senior. The help desk was excellent and it took no time at all to get up and running. My Mother has had it since Christmas and uses it in three different locations with no problems (we use the extra toll free option).The main downside of the unit (that is often used by seniors)are the small letters in the display. Although she has good to moderate vision, my mother strains to see it. Some way to see a larger letter size would be useful, (or optional lens to put in front of it).The unit is invaluable to keep in contact daily since my mother is out of state. She also gets great enjoyment of being able to stay in touch with a simple unit.Overall, this was an excellent Christmas present for her!"
1,Landel's Customer support is horrible.,"I bought this for my mother about 2 weeks ago and its still not set up. You call the 800 number and have to leave a message. No one has called back. The one time I got a human to answer the phone, she just said to leave a name, number and a message. I explained that I had and I would like to speak to someone. She hung up on me :(Support is only Monday - Friday 8-5 Pacific time."
2,Landel is Trying to Help,"I gave this product 1 star based on problems I have encountered with one I bought for my in-laws. (See previous review). In fairness, I have to say that after I e-mailed a complaint to Landel, their customer service people have gone beyond the call of duty to try and help. Still don't have the mailbug operating yet, but I am hopeful. Apparently the one I bought had a problem and somehow got electrically fried (it was connected to a surge protector along with a phone and answering machine. None of the other applicances suffered any harm, but the mailbug was zapped. A customer service rep said there have been problems like this recently.) Anyway, everything I've heard about mailbugs in service is positive. The service department is really trying to help and I think it will pay off soon."
1,SO far no good,"So far the Mailbug has proven to be totally unreliable. I tried for more than 1/2 hour Monday night to log in and I was refused. With no customer support available at night, you waste an evening twidling your thumbs waiting for them to get back to you. And there's no help on the weekends, either. I guess the old saying is true: You get what you pay for. Pay little, get little. It's toobad, too. The machine itself is a good machine but the human factor is what screws it up. I was hoping to use this in my work as a freelance writer, emailing stories on deadline to news organizations but I don't think it's reliable enough for that."
5,"For my Mom, didn't like computer","This device is great for the elderly who are intimated by computers. my mom loved it, she had complained almost every time she used her computer. she found this very user friendly and started using it with miminal help. i would strongly recommend this for older relatives wanting to stay in touch."
1,BEWARE,"I ordered this machine for my 75 year old mom who is very hard of hearing. She has a mailstation that has just recently died. She loves emailing everyone and since I live in another state, it's a good way to check on her every day by the emails she sends. I just got off the phone with Landel (the company that makes these machines) to go a head and set up the account for her. I was informed that she had to do it with the machine there. When I explained she can't hear, they suggested I have her return the one I ordered from Amazon and buy it from them. I'm sure Amazon would find that statement interesting. I was informed I couldn't set it up and she would have to do it or find someone who can help her. What her 80 year old friend? So I am appalled at the lack of thought that went into this set up as I'm sure there are plenty of people in my situation. So just be aware this is the case before you purchase this product."
2,MY MOTHER'S MAILBUG,"My mother had two different mail stations. Both broke. I ended up purchasing a mailbug for her instead. Now, she wanted something to only read e-mail, and that's exactly what she got. You cannot receive any photos, smiley faces or graphics. You cannot search through the internet.Yes, it is very, very easy to use. My mother is 83 and has a very limited ability to work with computers, etc. But, for the money spent for the item, AND your monthly subscription, it's no bargin."
1,SPAM made this usless,We purchased this for my 80+ year old mother-in-law who has no computer experience thinking it would be simple to use and practicle for sending messages to 4 - 5 family members around the USA. It was fine for about two weeks then the email account was inundated with SPAM. Mother-in-law could not cope with this and the service provider has NO SPAM filter nor any solution for the problem. We cancelled the email account and removed the appliance from mother-in-law's residence.
5,MAILBUG--THE SENIORS ANSWER TO THE INTERNET,I PURCHASED A MAILBUG THRU AMAZON.COM AND GOT IT IN 3 DAYS. I INSTALLED THE PRODUCT ON MY NORMAL TELEPHONE LINE AND IN ONE DAY WAS ABLE TO USE IT FULLY. WHEN I WANTED TO PRINT OUT A MESSAGE I MERELY FORWARDED TO ONE OF MY REGULAR COMPUTERS AND EASILY PRINTED IT OUT. IT IS AN EXCELLENT MACHINE WHICH I WILL SHOW SOME OF MY SENIOR STUDENTS. I'M SURE THEY WILL BE AS EXCITED AS I WAS.ROBERT SHEA
2,Support is non-existent,"After receiving my Mailbug, I contacted support to learn that they are only open from 9 to 4:30 Pacific Time. Since I live in the Central time zone that's 7 - 2:30. Not even 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I have left many messages - you only get voice mail jail not a real person when you call - and e-mailed them.All I want to do is activate it so my Mother-in-law can use it as a replacement for the discontinued Mail Station and Earthlink service."
4,Helpful sourecebook,"As a new physics teacher, I found this book very useful, not to mention CD-s with excellent demonstrations. It's a great book, which gives you a lot of material for classes, but it also leads you to other ideas. I have only one objection - it's the layout of the book, it would be good if it got updated."
4,Very good,Excellent. Very sort demonstrations with simple explanations. The only missing subject are quantum effects.It is a very important complementary material for teaching all level.
4,A helpful resource,This is a book that you need either as a text or on your shelf for reference use. These GE books are filled with good worksheets and they progress well enough to be used in lesson planing.
3,Pretty average,"I had heard the single ""When the Broken Hearted Love Again"" and enjoyed it, so I was eager to pick up a full CD by Danielle. However, I'm a bit disappointed as ""When the Broken Hearted"" is the best song on the CD and most of the rest are pretty bland generic dance/pop.It's not bad, per se, just incredibly dull most of the way through, with little to distinguish one forgettable song from another."
1,Where's the zero-star option?,"I bought a pair of these for use with a relatively new Mac G5 and neither worked on the firewire bus. Macally has a firmware update for the enclosure which is supposed to make it work with Mac OS X 10.3.9 systems (which mine is), but after updating one of the enclosures it still didn't work completely (it was never recognized when I plugged it into my front firewire socket). I never could update the firmware on the other enclosure. I followed the exact steps on the Macally support site for both, but the second enclosure ended up in a state that simply crashes my G5 when I plug the drive into the firewire port.I contacted Macally by email and never received a response.Don't be deceived by the brand name, as I was, into thinking this product is more likely to work well with a Mac. It almost certainly *won't* work out of the box (you'll need that firmware update if you have kept your system updated), and it may not ever work at all, at least not as a firewire device."
2,"Failed after a couple of years, power connection has design flaw","The loose power connector required some careful setup to make sure the cord wouldn't just fall out. Then it worked ok for about two years before it quit spinning up the disk. Unfortunately the customer service is pretty bad. There is no troubleshooting documentation (or even anything that explains how to interpret the blue and red indicator lights), and the company does not have replacement parts available. I will not be buying this brand again."
3,Power supply not adequate for Seagate 300 GB drive,"The PHR-100AC comes with a Rexon 5V/1.5A 12V/1.5A power supply, which according to Macally support is NOT powerful enough for the Seagate 300 GB Barracuda 7200.8 drive. Before buying this enclosure I'd verify with Macally that it works with your drive. 626.338.8787 to contact them. With the drive installed, the enclosure's LED flashes red/blue and chirps. I'm waiting on a replacement power supply from Macally (had to ship the other one at my expense to them first). Apparently the 300 GB drive was released after this enclosure was released -- thus the inadequate power supply"
4,Saved me,"I desperately needed the files from my old hard drive and didn't have the time or inclination to have somebody else get them from my old dead computer. After unpacking the Macally enclosure, I read the directions, removed my old hard drive, installed it in the enclosure and was accessing my files within 30 minutes of unpacking the device. I should mention that until now, I had never, ever opened or even seen the inside of a computer or heard of a 40-pin ribbon cable. Great and easy. I couldn't have asked for more."
4,Worked for me...,"Many of the reviews for this product simply discuss whether or not it worked for them. I decided to take a chance and bought it.The instructions to install my drive were simple enough, I booted it up and plugged it into my G4 PowerMac with FireWire and...it worked fine. First try. No configuration necessary. Your mileage may vary, but I've had no problems with it.Why only four stars then? Well if it is made to be used with Macs it could at least be a little prettier."
3,gets the job done.. but thats it,"theres nothing really BIG about this product, it does what its advertised and thats it. Its basically the cheapest available hard drive *firewire* enclosure on amazon. one thing ive noticed is it cannot sleep its drive on a mac. in other words your drive will never take a pause. its obviously a firmware issue, but then again i don't think its firmware is updatable in the future.if you need to get stuff off an old drive to temporary use.. this drive is for you. otherwise, its not recommended for use as a every day thing. buy a real external drive or go for a USB 2.0 hard drive enclosure (and cheaper) if you have it on your computer."
2,Tech support is terrible,"I emailed tech support for a simple presales question: ""What is the biggest hard drive this will take?"" I asked because when researching a few enclosures, some were rated for drives up to 400 GB, some 1000 GB, and so on -- I wanted something that would work into the future with pretty big drives.The reply: ""We haven't had any complaints.""Wow. No complaints. That's one heck of a technical specification. Thanks Macally. I wrote them back and it just got worse.Based on that and the various reviews here regarding Firewire failures, I decided not to buy (as I would be using it with Firewire). If I did have a problem, this is NOT the level of tech support I want to have to deal with."
5,Problem Free,"Installation is very easy and intuitive. Literally took me about 5 mintues -- unscrew the case open, slide in your hard drive, snap in a couple of connectors, screw case closed, and voila -- external hard drive is ready to go. I've been using this enclosure, coupled with an internal WD 300GB HDD, for about 6 months now without any problems. Works like a charm."
2,Be Careful with Compatibility,"Do not buy this enclosure if you intend to use a Seagate 300 GB Barracuda drive and probably similar drives. Macally doesn't tell you this in advance. To make matters worse, I contacted tech support and was told that I could return the power supply at my own expense and THEN they would send me a replacement. This exchange would require weeks. I might have been willing to accept a replacement if they had offered to send me the power supply immediately. I'll return the Macally 100AC and look for a more reputable company."
1,Cords come out too easily,The usb and power cords come out very easily which ends up being dangerous for the hard drive file system. The power cord kind of sags in the socket.
1,Drive Destroyer,"This drive enclosure has corrupted my hard drive directories so many times now it is getting ridiculous. Disk Warrior has saved me a number of times, but it looks like this time I am having to reinitialize and losing all data. The plugs are really loose, and if one accidentally comes out, it WILL corrupt your data and you WILL need some kind of premier disk repair software to fix it. If you own this accident waiting to happen, be sure to SECURE THE PLUGS!"
2,Flimsy with poor electrics,"Major flaws:* The power plug is too loose, so it often falls out, which crashes the hard drive inside.* Firewire mode does not work. (Mac OS X)Minor flaw:* Built from cheap plastic.In my old apartment, this device constantly unplugged itself and was incredibly noisy. I moved apartments, set up a new desk, and switched out to a different hard drive (and I think I unplugged the internal fan too), and now it's much better-- the wiring connection is more stable, and the new drive is quieter."
2,USB doesn't work,"Well, so far it's a nice enclosure and firewire works fine, but the USB is completely dead.Back to amazon it goes..."
1,Failure rate is far too high,"I ordered 4 of these drive enclosures last summer because the one I had ordered a few months earlier worked so well. One of those drives was DOA and had to be returned. The firewire port on a second enclosure just failed about 10 months into using it. Clearly the quality control on these drives is not very good if a failure rate of 50% is seen.At least they are failing within the 1 year warranty period, so I can return the enclosures for replacements, but keep your receipt."
4,Now that I figured this out...,"...it's awesome. The Firewire connection is fast on my machine without a USB2.0 port, and I can easily either swap out drives from the enclosure or switch plugs to access different content.It's not obvious how to set this up if you're like me and don't read manuals. You need to open a relatively obscure administrative tool in Windows to get the drive formatted and recognized with a drive letter. Once I did that, though, I backed up all my music and images and I'm pleased as punch."
4,Beautiful keepsake,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. I wanted her to have something that she could have forever, and that was real silver with semi-precious stone.It's beautiful, and she was absolutely thrilled. I would buy one again. The only complaint is that the hinge joining the two pieces broke. It's still very good and functional...."
3,not very functional,"Opening this locket is difficult. There really isn't a clasp to help you separate the two halves, you just sort of pull them apart. The inside is just like an empty box there's no slot for the pictures. As a pendant it's very pretty, but not a very functional locket. It also does not come with a chain."
3,Read the other reviews...,"... both good and bad. In this particular case, they all give a fair view of the content of the book.I bought the book because I wanted to read something about MACD, from the guy who came up with the idea. There are so many ideas out there and I have found it useful to let the inventor himself speak for his idea - rather than getting somebody else's rehash of the idea.If you want to get a feel for MACD book is okay. There are some other ideas in book as well, but how many ideas do you need? I would not recommend the book for those ideas. Another reviewer pointed out that his newsletter is quite poorly ranked. That is also something to take into account when reading random ideas."
3,Great resource for technical analysis,"Like some of the other commentors, I bought this book because I love the MACD as a technical tool and I really looked forward to reading a book from the inventor. The part on the MACD indicator and how the use it is really great, there is stuff in there I have not encountered yet in other books that described the MACD indicator, like using one MACD for entries and a slower one for exits (in a bull market).The rest of the book was ok, some new material but nothing really interesting (at least in my opinion). Most of the stuff I had already seen in other books.The book was also well written, not boring at all, and overall very clearly."
4,Good Book on Technical Analysis,This is a good book to technical analysis. The value of the book in the four (4) modes of the market and his explanation of his MACD System.
1,another useless TA book,"Yes, yet another poorly backtested TA book. How is that people expect ad hoc or at best linear indicators to predict the markets? This guy invented macd (just a glorified smoothed out version of the second derivative of price, nothing more than that) and the book has a chapter on it - nothing deep, usual TA level nonsense."
3,Great idea but maybe try a different kit,"This has been sitting on our shelf for about a year because it's a little more labor intensive on my part than I wanted it to be. For the recycling project they want you to make paper by blending used paper up in your kitchen blender. Sorry, but I don't want to wreck my blender to make a sheet of paper. Also, the kit does not contain very interesting items. There are a couple seeds and some dirt to plant them in, there is a ruler, and there are some magnets."
1,Lentek Bite Shield 100% NOT EFFECTIVE,"I bought the Lentek Bite Shield so I could use it indoors at night after getting bitten alive by mosquitoes.I strongly recommend that everyone avoid this product. It was advertised as being effective within a 15' radius. It didn't work within 1 foot of my head,After 4 nights of use (and note that the expensive refills don't last very long), and a dozen bites later, I gave up. Mosquitoes weren't deterred in the least by this product, so don't bother buying it."
4,A Quality Release,"Not my favorite of all of the Dieselboy Drum & Bass mixes, but it's definitely up there. If you're new to Jungle/DnB or Dieselboy, I must advise that you get Dungeonmaster's Guide instead, but if you're looking to diversify your Dieselboy portfolio, this album is a great choice."
5,I love jungle!,"Not much to say except that this album, like everything else mixed by Dieselboy gets you moving."
4,A Bauer favorite,"This is strictly for Steven Bauer fans only. I enjoyed the film, glad to see it on video. Buy the video before it goes out of print."
5,Software Configuration Management : Coordination for Team Pr,"This is a small, easy to read book that covers the basics of SCM better than most of the books on the market. Even though it's currently out of print, this is probably one of my all time-favorites books on SCM, especially when I'm trying to introduce the concepts to first-time readers. Many of the books seem to talk around the subject and never actually get down to what the fundamental aspects of SCM actually do."
2,Don't Judge a Book By It's Title,"I have no doubt that this book will come in handy for college level ""calc"" students looking for a refresher, but DO NOT confuse this as a ""Calculus for Dummies"" approach to the subject. From the first couple of pages I felt as though I had been thrown in the deep end of the pool in order to learn how to swim. I was anticipating a more accessible book and I was disappointed. The examples of tomato sauce mold, rocket launched meatballs and giant pepperoni (don't ask) didn't serve to ground calculus in the real world for me. Again, maybe a terrific text for people that already have a grounding in the subject, but hardly as comforting as the title would lead you to believe."
3,pizazz,The lively style does not make up for non-innovative substance on the topics dealt with. It is not Pickover's best book.
4,Great back to faith basics book,"Candy Abbott shares her heart and her faith in Fruitbearer, What Can I Do For YOU, Lord? This book reminds the believer to stay rooted in Christ and refreshes the first love you had for the Lord. With vivid description and emotion, Candy draws you into her life and experiences and shows how much the Holy Spirit is woven into all aspects of a believer's life. The book is charismatic in nature, honest in it's story and full of the glory of God.Pam HalterChildren's author"
4,Reflecting on BBQ Perfection,"Lee Bentch takes the reader through his process from novice to expert on his quest to learn to cook mouth watering bbq and shares his experiences. He is a knowledgeable bbq cook with an entertaining wit. Lee's experience in the corporate world helps relate bbq to business and offers cautionary insight for wannabe bbq restauranteurs. Whether you are a back yard chef, or you make a living cooking for others, this book is worth reading. It will make you laugh, it will make you think, but most of all, it will remind you some things about bbq you may have forgotten."
3,Some more Smoke please,"Not a bad collection of thoughts. I expected a bit more though as there seemed to be a bit more focus on the Life and a little on BBQ and even less on the Business as the title claimed. To clarify that last statement, it was what I expected in terms of content based on other user reviews and book preview; I just wish there was more of it (read thicker book). Otherwise I identified with a lot of the musings and gained perspective on other aspects of 'smokeology'. For the record, am just a rookie at barbecue!"
2,A falcon guide rip-off,"It turns out that the Dave Hall wrote one book, but it is called by two different titles(no doubt to increase sales). One is titled ""The Hiker's Guide to Utah"" and the other ""Hiking Utah"". They are completely the same, even the copyright date. It is hard to objectively look at the book content when the publisher and writer are purposefully trying to rip off the hiking public. No more Falcon guides for me, no matter what the subject!"
3,"Eh..., it's all right...","I got this for Christmas last year, and started using it for my cookies this year. I've never used any kind of press before, so cannot compare.It's not bad - it's pretty fast. The button is awkward - at the top where your hands can slip, rather than around the base where you grip it. It's difficult to get the container onto it - it takes a few tries to get it to connect.The pushy screw thing in the middle will come off if you try to pull it out of the container to refill it, it works better to just push it on through.The recipes included are terrible - throw the book away. Type ""recipe best spritz cookie"" into a search engine and look for a well reviewed recipe. These CAN be really good cookies."
1,YIKES!!! If you see this on the shelf RUN!,"Wow... This cookie press blows! I'm not really sure what else to say. Used it one time and half way through my cookies it broke. Before it kicked the bucket, the cookies came out of the press in some shape that looked NOTHING like the ""adorable disc shapes"" the side of the box claims they make! I hope someone reads this reviews before you make the same mistake I did.... RUN FOREST RUN!!!!!"
1,It is a piece of crap.,This press barely can make a few cookies using only a few of the disks. DO NOT BUY.
1,Would Not Buy,I wanted an electric cookie press and received this as an early Christmas present from my sister. I used it for Christmas cookies and was not impressed. It was awkward to use and not very smooth. I just got it out again to make some cheese straws and half way through making them it died. I would not purchase this or suggest that anyone purchase it. It is junk!!
4,good cookie press,"i used this gadget for the first time last weekend making cookies and it works great for me. at first the cookie shape was funny because i was not used to the gadget but afer several practice, the cookies turned out great. it's definitely faster than a manual one. i like it and had fun using it."
1,Salton electric cookie press,I bought one of these but returned it. I couldn't get it open to fill it.
1,"Don't waste your money, this is awful!","This is a terrible electric cookie maker, first try was a disaster. In the trash it goes!"
3,"Hill Street Blues, The Very Best of (Boxed Set)","Back in the ancient age of television, there was a cop show that surpassed all others. It was down to earth, dealt with people as people and made you forget that this was TV. I watched HSB when it was on prime time and I watched the reruns during the summer and the syndicated reruns. Steven Bochco broke into prime time with this show. It's hard to put into words what living with each character every week meant. If you are a TV viewer and haven't seen this show, then you've been on a desert island. Highly recommended for it's cast, suspense and relevant content."
5,Make A Point To Learn About Jarrard Anthony,"This is simply an excellent CD and should appeal to those between 15 and 50. Everytime I listen to it I find it hard to believe this CD was not played over and over on radio stations. Well-produced with excellent musicanship, pretty much every song on the CD is a keeper. Why is it that the guys with real talent can't catch a break instead of those major record no talent guys who smother the airwaves. I know good quality music and talent and Jarrard Anthony has them both!"
4,Photo Archive of Gettysburg Monuments,"This is a photo archive of nearly every monument at Gettysburg. The new Gen. Longstreet equestrian monument is not featured but seemingly everything else is, so this book is great to find an ancestor's unit and to catch monuments you might have missed during a visit. There are b&w photos with the name of each monument and a few color photos in this 72 page softcover booklet.In addition to the famous battle, Gettysburg is a tourist attraction for the sculptured monuments built over the generations and this book provides an armchair view of those Civil War themed monuments"
2,"Too much name dropping, too little pilgrimaging","My title explains much of my reaction to this book. I felt like Muggeridge was simply trying to capitalize on his career and his association with Mother Teresa. He regularly tries to convince the reader that he has difficulties and temptations to overcome, but far more of the time in this book is spent on non-spiritual matters.I should also say that Muggeridge has some fairly conservative views on issues, particularly abortion, and if you don't share them, he doesn't give any room for disagreement. While I acknowledge his rights to have those beliefs, I will exercise my right not to read his works further."
3,Check size!!!!,"As many people have stated...The fitness ball was advertised to be 65cm and SAYS 65 cm on the ball, when measured it is smaller..."
1,No plug = useless,"I saw the reviews complaining about a lack of plug but figured that TKO (or the seller) must have remedied that situation by now. Lo and behold, mine came with no plug. It may be a decent ball, but right now it's completely useless. The instructions don't even mention a plug. Inexcusable."
4,Really doesn't burst,"What truly attracted me to the TKO Anti Burst Fitness Ball was the anti-burstness. I can only assume that the other balls on the market instantly and spontaneously burst causing rubber shrapnel to spray in a 360 degree arc of death. I'm surprised I have not heard more news reports of the pro-burst alternatives causing widespread panic amongst the fitness-minded masses.Bizarre branding aside - I have two of these, one at work and one at home. They sit in front of my computer desks and provide a comfortable alternative to boring computer chairs. As a fidget who can't stop moving, bouncing on the ball while working suits me perfectly - especially when combined with great, pumping tunes."
2,not 65 cm,"The ball is a pretty color and seems to be well made.However, I measured 65 cm on the wall, and I blew it up until the pump actually popped out (it couldn't hold anymore air), and it still wasn't close to a 65 cm diameter. At first I thought I was just doing a bad job extending a measuring tape out from the 65 cm point on the wall, so I measured the circumference (around the ball). The circumference was 174 cm, which would correspond to a 55 cm diameter almost exactly. That's a full size smaller! The ball itself says 65 cm on it. My knees point up when I sit on the ball, and they're supposed to be at a 90 degree angle, so the ball is definitely too small. I'm 5'6"", and the instructions say the 65 cm ball is for people over 5'7"", so it's definitely not right.I'll probably be sending it back, if I can ever get the plug out, that is! Otherwise, it's nice enough. On a side note, my ball came with two plugs, so I guess that means someone else's came with none."
2,Missing pump,I just received mine today and the pump is missing.Planning to borrow one and use ... Disappointed that about the poor quality control which resulted in sipping it without the advertised parts.
1,55cm not 65 cm!!!!,"My ball has felt like it's shorter than it should be. Today I measured it. Although it's labeled 65 cm, it is only 55 cm tall. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,Damaged Goods,Excited to order and receive Fitness Ball. But order arrived without plug for the ball so it will not hold air.
3,"Oops, the plug was there!","Ok, I originally thought there was no plug but wrapped in the plastic it came with were two white plugs. Look in the plastic bubble ""trash"" part if you can't find it. They really should make it easier to find the plug."
5,EXCELLENT!!,I ordered the 75cm size and it is HUGE!! The ball had NO smell as I unwrapped it (as I read can be a problem with some other brands) The pump that is included is sturdy and filled the ball up quickly. They included an extra plug in case you lose the original. This ball is STRONG and durable. I am very happy with my purchase!
5,Great Ball at a Great Price,I bought this ball as an office chair and have been using it for a while now. It is sturdy and holds air great.
5,I love my fitness ball!,"The fitness ball is one of the most interesting new pieces of exercise equipment to come along in many years. It has many different uses, leaving you only limited by your imagination. TKO's fitness ball is strong and sturdy, inflates easily (at least mine does), and works great. So far, I have absolutely no complaints, and love my fitness ball!(Review of TKO Anti Burst Fitness Ball Set 75cm)"
1,Useless without air plugs....hello?!?!,"I'd say that sums it up. After being informed there was going to be a shipping delay on the day I was supposed to receive the ball, then waiting an additional 3 days for the ball to arrive, it comes with no airplug. Anywhere. It was not stapled to the instructions as another reviewer stated, not hidden anywhere in the box - nothing! Makes using the ball pretty difficult - what a hassle to deal with a return now! Had I known this, I would have just picked one up a week and a half ago at the store!"
1,NO PLUG!!,"I should have read the reviews and saved myself some time. I will buy a different ball from someone else. Soo disapointed!!***amazon is allowingme to return the ball, they will refund me my money and pay for shipping. Thanks amazon! however it would be great if you would stop selling JUNK!!"
1,what crap,"this ball is a 55cm not a 75cm that it is marked. i own a 65cm ball that towers over this thing. not impressed with TKO.do not buy... read the other reviews and be warned. so you know i am a personal trainer i deal with fitness balls all the time.Update: called TKO over 2 weeks ago hoping to talk to someone, left 2 voice mails. have yet to hear form a single person in the company on there product. again what crap!Update: has been OVER A YEAR and i still have not heard word one from this company. before i sent this giant piece of junk back I did the max fill on the ball just short of bursting. the ball was SO full that it had ZERO give to it and it was still under 65cm. not even close to the 75cm that the ball was stated at."
2,Low price low quality,"Sure, it's just a ball, but- the material quality is low, the surface looks almost like it's peeling.- it has a strong smell. I was going to put it in a baby room, but instead placed it in the basement.I have another ball from Natural Fitness - it's a bit more expensive, but it doesn't have the above shortcomings."
3,Seems durable,"I use this ball to sit on at my work desk all day long. For that purpose, there are two drawbacks - it deflates enough to need air at least once a week and it doesn't have a 'base' (one area on the ball is heavier or has a pocket of sand) like some do that stops it from rolling away. Maybe unfair to rate 3 stars for this purpsoe, but...there are better options out there."
3,*VERY* small!,"Other than the size, the product is as advertised but as other reviewers have stated it is several inches smaller than advertised. (Yes, I measured it correctly...including by measuring the heights of the drawers on my desk & comparing to the inflated height of the ball). It would probably be fine if I just wanted it for a yoga ball, but since I was supposed to be using it as a replacement desk chair I'm not terribly happy."
4,Makes a great desk chair!,I bought this item to use as a desk chair at my desk job - worked out well. If I could just stop people from stealing it to play with it...
3,"Nice Ball, Bad Pump","I bought this ball for everyday use, to sit on. The ball appears nice. We'll have to wait and see how long it last. My biggest problem is the air pump provided. Throw this guy away. You may live long enough to get it aired up, I won't. I used an air compressor. There is a nice chart for working out. And that's great, but what if I want two balls? The packaging is very nice, too. Like WAY too nice. What I want is only buy the ball, not the pump, or chart, or fancy packaging. Just the ball placed in a mailer would be wonderful, not frills, for half price."
3,Not too bad,"As others have said, this ball is pretty good, but the pump is absolutely terrible. On my third pump the top half of it came off. Luckily I still have a foot pump from a previous ball. Once this was filled it seemed ok. The ball is a little lopsided and it has a slow air leak so I have to pump it up every week or two, but otherwise it seems very sturdy and less likely to pop that my last one. Minus one star for the horrible pump that is a waste of space, and minus another for the minor air leak and lopsidedness. Other than that, it's a pretty good ball and works great as a replacement to my office chair."
3,not very sturdy,"I bought two 65 cm balls and both inflated to different diameters. One is much firmer than the other, surprisingly the one that has less air. Im sending back the other, maybe i just got a bad one. I'm doing P90X2 and the ball was way too squishy to do the pushups or planks on. The one seems ok, i'll change my review of the new one turns out better."
5,perfect product with air pump,"it is a perfect item to buy, but do not buy an extra air pump! it comes with this item. i was planning to buy a pump by itself bcz amazon suggested me to buy as ""others also buy"". AIR PUMP COMES WITH THIS PRODUCT!! DO NOT WORRY!! save extra $10 including shipping!! it was one of the best purchase i made from amazon.com as my real voice!"
5,Perfect for sitting at a desk!,"A great size for sitting at a desk if you are anywhere between 5'4"" and 5'11"". Super stable. Note, it does take a couple days to ""grow"" to it's full size."
1,Pump broke instantly,"The pump broke right away. We can't fill up the ball at all! The pump is a piece of junk. We did have the air pins, though."
5,office chair,"I sit on the ball for 8 hours a day at work. I love it. Easy to inflate, sturdy and comfortable for my height (5'10"")"
3,Plan on an extra few days to get a replacement plug,"I'm another unlucky customer who received the ball without the plug (on Jan 5 2012). Now it's worthless until I get customer service to send me a plug. Infuriating after paying for quick shipping!UPDATE: TKO Customer Support contacted me today (left a message after hours last night) and is shipping a replacement plug. I told her about the many Amazon reviews complaining of missing plugs and she said they had a production issue that wasn't caught until after Amazon bought their bulk supply. So, there's apparently still a pile of them at Amazon that will go out plugless until the bad supply is depleted at whichever Amazon warehouses still have them. So, at least Customer Service is responsive and can fix the issue within a few days after purchase."
2,"Took weeks to receive, then missing the plug.","This item took nearly three weeks to receive. I ordered it on the same day I ordered a few exercise DVD's that gave you 30 days to return if you were unsatisfied. When the ball finally got here, it didn't have the plug so I still couldn't use it. I called the company to request one, got an answering machine, left a message, and still have not received a call back. Guess I'm keeping those DVD's whether I like them or not and now I have to pack up and pay to ship ball back. Very disappointed."
1,Useless,"I ordered this to use as an office chair, and it can't hold air because it is missing the plug. I noticed that another reviewer had the same issue before I bought it, but I thought it was just a random occurrence or that he or she lost it. I guess not. This item is not not expensive enough to deal with the hassle of sending it back, so I'll just leave a 1-star review to warn others. Maybe I can find or make something that will work."
1,NO PLUG!,"I guess I didn't read the reviews when I ordered this product. I recieved the product and there is no plug for the ball. I have not contacted Amazon or the manufacturer yet, but I just wanted to get my review out there before I forgot. Will update with their remedy."
1,Wrong Size,"I started using a 65cm fitness ball at work instead of an office chair, and I feel SO much better with it. So naturally, I wanted to do the same thing at home. However, my office desk at home is custom built by my dad specifically for my height (5'9"" mostly leg height), so I knew the 65cm ball would not suffice here. I ordered this ball instead. First, after I added the air, I thought I must have done something incorrect, because it was so much smaller than my 65cm ball from work. I felt like I was sitting in a pre-k room on it. It wasn't even as tall as my couch! I re-read the instructions, but found nothing different than what I had done. But just in case, I deflated the ball and tried to do it again. Same result. I have it packaged for return today (a day after I received it), and I'm going to get a real 75cm ball at Wal-Mart where my 65cm one came from. Do not buy this if you really need a 75cm ball."
4,Great but smaller than expected,"I am barely 5'7"", and this ball was too small for me. If you are 5'6"" or taller I recommend getting the 75cm one so that your thighs can be parallel to the floor when you sit on it. I followed all the instructions on how to fill it properly, and the ball is very durable, has no odor, and great in all other aspects. The air pump it came with was easy to use. I would buy a TKO product again."
4,Great toning chair!,"The TKO Fitness Ball is great for helping you learn balance. I sit on it while playing the Wii; therefore, exercising my arms while maintaining balance on the ball with my legs. Very heavy duty and would recommend to anyone interested in toning."
1,smells like melted plastic; pump DOA,"Sadly, this stability ball is junk. Three weeks in the open air after shipping, and it still smells like melting plastic. Worse, the pump it shipped with arrived covered with some kind of grease and clearly non-functional. I emailed TKO weeks ago for a replacement pump that I have yet to receive. Avoid."
1,Pump doesn't work,"Like other reviewers have commented, the pump is more than frustrating. I even disassembled the pump and repacked the O ring with vasoline which helped a little. Eventually had to buy from Amazon the ""Custom Accessories 59016 Inflator Adapter"" because the ball requires a cone fitting."
2,Wouldn't inflate all the way,"While the quality of the ball is very nice, I couldn't get the ball to inflate all the way, making it useless. I was very dissapointed, and by the time I got around to trying it, it was already past the time to be able to return it. I love these balls and they are great for my back, but this one wasn't worth the money."
4,Perfect birthing ball,"I needed to purchase a fitness ball for my upcoming first birth (trying to labor as much as possible at home and the ball helps cope with pain) and this ball is perfect. The only advice I can give is to take it out of the box and blow it up immediately. The ball does have an odor to it, so you definitely need to air it out. Other than that, it's perfect!"
5,Exactly as advertised,"I've had this ball for a while now and it is still well inflated. I needed a ball for some recommended PT exercises and purchased it because it was described as Anti Burst. The size works well as described, or at least the 65 mm for a 5'6"" person.The thing that you may not like is that the pump that comes with the ball sucks. This is not specific to this particular ball, all of the free pumps suck. If you have a bicycle tire pump or something else do yourself a huge favor and use that instead. Go borrow one from your neighbor, buy one and return it, anything but don't bother to use the pump this ball comes with."
3,missing plastic plug,If your planning to buy this. Be aware that it has a missing plastic plug. The company is out of stock for the plastic plug. So you going to have to search for it at another website or go to a sports store to find the plastic plug.So decide before you buy.
5,Getting back to my ole self,This ball is helping me get some of the strength back that I lost do to a recent illness and injury. Great pictorial and suggestions for use are included and you can easily invent a few of you own. First steps to getting my life back. Thank you.
4,Fun and Affordable :),"I got this for the office after having to switch my chair 2-3 times a week (at the computer 8 hours a day). This is Wonderful! And Fun LOL. I may have to get another one for home. I'm overweight and 5'4"" and this size seems to work well for me so far -- though I should probably inflate it more than it is now. However, my back already feels better and I'm bouncing to my music which is making my morning go a little faster than usual ;). I'll update after I've used it more."
1,Missing Parts!!!!,Received the product. The piece to stop the air from coming out was missing in the box. This makes the product unusable!Do not buy.... Now I have the hassle of trying to find a replacement part or return the product. DO NOT BUY.
3,Not 75 cm,"The ball is of good quality, however, the ball ordered and received is stamped ""75 cm"". The actual diameter of the ball is no where near 75 cm, fully inflated. I would venture to say that this is a mis-labeled 55cm ball."
3,I've had better,"I orderd this ball to use as a chair at my office. I would say that I am sitting on it between 5-6 hrs a day depending on the events that occur. I am on my second one as of right now and am not too impressed. The first ball that I recieved couldnt hold air and I would end up having the fill it up every other day. After about the 4th time of doing that I sent it back hoping I just recieved a lemon.The second one I have had for about 2 weeks and is lopsided. It definetley holds air better than the first but unless you are sitting on it just right you almost fall off.I am going to keep the second just becuase I dont feel like sending it back and getting another leaking one.Overall I would not reccomend this as a ball to use a chair. I'm sure it would work great as just a work out ball, but not on something you are relying on to support you for extended periods of time."
3,BALL OK BUT SMALL,"I read many reviews before I ordered and technically I should have the 65 cm ball, but went with the larger one because I've found they run small. Well I'm 5' 6"" and the 75 cm ball is too small for me. I can't bend my legs at the appropriate 90 degree angle. I think I'm going to return it."
2,No plug? Really?,The ball itself is a bit smaller than I expected and it came without a plug. Amazon was nice enough to refund 10$ (surprisingly the exact amount to buy a plug from an external vendor) but it's still a poor product. I would recommend buying it unless you want a smaller ball and have extra plugs laying around.
1,Came without a plug!!!,"Really?? It was the biggest letdown in my history with Amazon. I ordered the product late Thursday night/early Friday morning and was super surprised to see that I would get it on Saturday. Totally stoked because that's the fastest shipment I've received since being on Prime. However, fast shipment was all for naught. It doesn't matter how fast you get your order if the product is defective or missing the most crucial piece (e.g., the plug that stops the air from coming out of the ball).Come on, TKO. Get your act together. I wish I would have read the other 1 star reviews before my order, since they report the same problem. Buyer beware!!!"
2,"OK ball, horrible odor!","The ball works OK, but it has a horrible, absolutely horrible odor. It has a very strong chemicals+BO smell and I can smell if from the other side of my bedroom. I'm trying to replace it with my office chair, but I really can't stand the small. I washed it soap in the shower, which made it slightly better, but not quite useable yet. I will leave it in the basement for the next few days and see if it goes away. Also, there are lots of scratches and peeled-off patches on the surface, and I wonder if someday it will pop."
2,"smaller size than specified, pump of low quality, unpleasant smell","I followed inflating instructions, inflated it to 80% of its size, waited 24 hours. I couldn't inflate it much more than that after 24 hours, the ball was already pretty tight and the pump was leaking air fast while pumping. It seems other reviewers had similar experience. Another thing of notice is the smell of the material. It was pretty strong especially after this thing was in my place for 24 hrs. I woke up with a headache in the morning that didn't go away till after I deflated and packaged the stability ball into the original packaging for return."
4,"Love the color, wish this brand weighted their balls","I use this ball as my office chair at work so I needed a color that would blend in. Since all the office chairs are black this one was just the ticket most people don't even notice I am sitting on a ball as a chair until I stand up. It rolls nicely under my desk when I leave the office so others don't notice it then either. I am 5'7"" and this is the perfect size/height for a replacement to office chair. Love it! Do wish that TKO would put weight (sand) in their balls like Rebock does because then it wouldn't keep rolling away - my only complaint. But Rebock only came in bright colors. So at home I have Rebock balls as chairs (the kids kept taking mine so I had to buy 4 more). And like them best because of the sand that keeps them from rolling away."
4,More exercise than you think,"I figured I would give this a try. My sister has used an exercise ball for years. It doesn't look hard but after an hour sitting on this thing I could feel it in my legs and back. It gives a pretty good workout.FYI, I weigh 350+ and it supports me. It is a pretty solid thing."
1,Unable to use it.,Opened up the packing and keep pumping in the air. But it was not able to hold or remain rounded after it is fully pumped. Cos there is no stopper. Disappointed with the product and need to throw it to the storeroom.
3,"Good Product, Missing Parts","I have used the TKO 75cm fitness ball at the gym, and decided to get one for my home for those days I can't make it to the gym. The ball arrived quickly from Amazon, but after inflating it and looking around for the plastic stopper, I realized that there wasn't a stopper in the package. Poor quality control by TKO. I called their customer service and they were very helpful and immediately shipped out a replacement stopper for me, but would have been nice to get the entire product in a single shipment."
2,Poorly designed pump...,I purchased this after my girlfriend got a similar model. The pump gave out after 5 minutes and now I can't even get it ready to use. What a waste of time/money!
3,It's just okay.,"I've had my ball for over a year now. I ordered the 65cm but after having read reviews, I don't know which one I received as the ball is not marked at all. It's blue. I'm 5'4"" and it works perfectly at my computer desk at work.The pump worked fine, didn't take too long for me to fill the ball. My issue with the pump is it's very easy to pinch your hand in it.As for the ball - no leaks, still working okay after a year and 2 months. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the ball was shipped folded up and a year later it is STILL deformed. I can only sit on it a certain way or else the balance is off."
2,Not 65 cm,"I ordered this ball so I could sit on it at my desk. When it was fully inflated, it was barely more than 55 cm. I'm sure it would have been fine for exercise, but not for what I needed. I already have a ball this size. I was disappointed that I had to go to the hassle of returning it because it wasn't even close to the size it was supposed to be."
1,False Advertising-Delivering You the Wrong Size,While the quality is nice- it is 100% false advertising. The ad along with the sticker on the ball say you are receiving a 65cm fitness ball and i guarantee you that the ball is only 55cm. I blew it up measured it and compared it to the other balls in my gym- both 55 and 65cm balls. This is definitely a 55cm ball. False advertising. I will not buy from this company again.
4,"arrived quickly, good product","I got this for sitting at work at my computer. It is very comfortable. Not that easy to inflate, but it holds its air well, so you don't have to do it often. Nice sitting option."
3,It's Okay...,"It would have been nice if it came with a foot pump instead of a hand pump (yeah, just looks...weird)I am 5'7 1/2 and the recommended size for me was 65cm. This suits me okay, but definitely on the smaller side. The plastic plug also doesn't seem to fit right but there's been not a lot of air loss. Overall, not bad - you pay for what you get, right?"
3,A Little Smaller and Squeaks,"The rubber on this TKO seems more durable than my previous Valeo ball, but the ball also seems a little smaller than 65cm and it makes more noise when I bounce on it. The hand pump it came with took awhile to fill up the ball, but seems higher quality than the foot pump that comes with the Valeo. I can neither recommend or not recommend this ball, so I'll give it three stars."
2,Size Mislabeled,"Ball says 65cm but it is only 55cm. I have another exercise that is 55cm and is labeled as such, and the TKO ball is exactly the same size. I also measured it and it is indeed only 55cm.What a bummer. I inflated it for nothing and now have to return it. Otherwise, looks to be a decent ball."
2,No inflation adapter,"I can't speak yet to the quality of the ball when in use, as I haven't inflated it yet. I would caution you to read the list of components carefully before buying. It does not include an adapter for inflating with a bicycle pump or electric air pump. When comparing the price of the TKO balls to the others (e.g., Thera-Band), make sure you check to see if an inflation adapter is included if you have and plan to use a bicycle or electric air pump. The price difference can more than evaporate if you need to buy an adapter. Of course, if you want to exercise your hands and arms, you'll do that with the hand pump that comes with this ball. ;>)"
3,Not really anti-burst. The cat popped mine easily.,"All was fine until my cat tried stepping on to it from the bed, got scared and burst it with a single claw as he jumped off.Not sure what anti-burst construction is supposed to mean."
4,It's a Ball! It's Round!,"The TKO Anti-Burst Fitness Ball comes complete with a nifty hand pump that inflates the ball in about a minute (unless you're too tired) and two handy golf-tee style hole plugs (in case one gets lost). The company suggests that you inflate the ball to 80% of capacity and let it sit for 24 hours to check for leaks. The instructions for figuring 80% of capacity are not included, but a handy wall-chart showing some exercises to do with the ball is. Also, the ball measurement is in centimeters, which will require some conversion for American and British purchasers. I purchased it to use as a desk chair, so I don't know how good it is for exercising. With the wall chart so conveniently describing many intriguing activities, I might use it for that too. I haven't got past my 24-hour test inflation period yet, so I can't comment on its ruggedness or durability, although I used a similar ball as a desk chair for most of the last two years at work, and I loved it."
2,Won't stay inflated,"Just opened the ball, seems to be good quality and was easy enough to inflate, but as soon as I remove the pump, it deflates again. There's no plug in the package. Anyone else have this problem? Previous exercise balls I've owned just plug themselves after removing the pump, but this one does not. Help!"
5,good for work,I bought this for work. I switch between this and my chair at work. The height of it is just perfect. It comes with a hand pump so easy to pump when it needs it. I have been using it for a month now and it's still seems fine. Nothing bad had happen to it.
1,Leaks. Plus the valve is poorly designed.,I used this ball as an desk chair in my home office. I don't sit on it for more than 4 hours a day and not more than 5 days a week. After two months it developed a slow leak and I cannot find out where it is. I tried patching parts of the ball to no avail. One night and it losses a third of its volume.Even if it didn't leak I'd give this ball a less than stellar review. There is a plastic push pin that plugs the valve. It is very difficult to get out when you would like to top off the air pressure.I'd rate this product zero if possible.My roommate has the 75cm GoFit Ball. It is much better.
5,Hasn't burst yet,"I sit on this ~8 hours a day, 5 days a week in lieu of an office chair. I'm a fairly larger person and this thing hasn't burst yet. There is a very slow loss in air over the course of weeks, but that's to be expected.The included pump is garbage though."
2,Missing Plug,The product seems decently study. Unfortunately after following the instructions to pump it up I looked through the box for plugs and could find none included. TKO is sending replacement plugs in about a week so I will re-review it then.
1,Seems to be a common problem,"This exercise ball was shipped without the plug/stopper. I had heard that was a common occurence with a different brand, so I ordered this one, only to find the same thing. How do I get a replacement???"
2,Horrible and pervasive chemical odor,"It is pretty hard to criticize a fitness ball. I have seen this brand at several gyms and the quality seems durable enough. Unfortunately, the ball has such a pervasive and intense odor that it is impossible to keep in your home. I truly can't emphasize this enough. After putting it in the closet, the smell transferred to all of my clothes. Finally, I put it in the hallway of my building (a small 3 story Victorian). Even after a week, the *entire* building smells like this weird chemical odor. And the halls are wide and airy (with no heat). I cringe at the thought of actually bumping into one of my neighbors. I have held off returning this in the hopes that the ball would air out. But no such luck. Returning these items is always a drag, and it is hard not to be just a little resentful at the lack of quality control."
2,Great ball - missing the plug though,"I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers. When this ball arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it arrived with no odor whatsoever. I recently ordered another brand and it smelled much worse for approximately three days.Unfortunately, there is no plug with this ball. You'll have to return it, exchange it, contact the manufacturer, or use a plug from a different exercise ball (if you have one that you don't mind deflating for a bit).I bought the 75 centimeter ball to use as a replacement for my desk chair. I am 5'6 and research told me that a 65 centimeter ball would be the right size. It was too small. This ball, which currently inflates to about 70 centimeters, is just about perfect for that use."
4,I really like this ball!,"The only reason I didn't give this ball 5 stars is because it does have a chemical smell that takes a while to dissipate (at least a couple months) and because the plug is hard to get in all the way. But it has been a great buy, we use it mainly for bouncing the baby to sleep while babywearing, and its the perfect size, I'm 5'2, my husband is 5'11 and he still likes to use it but his legs are not at a perfect 90 degree angle. It does need to be blown up occasionally from sitting on it so much. But I would definitely recommend this ball!"
1,Unsatisfactory,"I selected the size based on my height. It is way too small. It also never gets completely full of air, which makes using it difficult. I followed the instructions exactly but it still will not get completely full. I tried filling in more a bit each day, but now I'm based the time I can return it, so I'm stuck with it."
5,Exercise Ball,"The ball was exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner. I do not regret this purchase, and I believe that it was worth every penny. :)"
3,Easy to blow up,"Very good product for the money. Easy to blow up and is sturdy plastic. My 10 year old daughter bought this to practice gymnastics on, and it is too small. So we are ordering a 72 cm. ball; however we are going to keep this one since it was so inexpensive, and my other daughter likes to sit on it."
1,Not recommended...,"I bought this ball not even a year ago, only use it maybe every other 3 days or so and it got a big tear in it. I'm the only only one who used it, don't understand why it would get a 3-4mm hole it it??? Disappointed because it cost so much..."
3,No Plug,"As others might have already mentioned , TKO is notorious of not packaging the Plug, so beware. Otherwise I am just using the ball as a replacement chair for my office desk and not for any exercises so can't complain much, but the build does feel a little less sturdy."
5,Great buyer and product!,Seems like a great product. Was easy to assemble and stays inflated. I would reccomend this product. I would buy this again if I needed to.
4,Fun to use,"I bought the 65cm ball and I am 5'6"". If you wanted to use this as a chair with a desk which is what I wanted it for, I'd go for the 75cm because it's a little low. Exercise wise, it's perfect so I just make use of it for exercise."
2,not 65cm - labels incorrect,"The ball seems like a very nice, high quality fitness ball, but TKO has an inventory problem -- as others have mentioned.I ordered a 65cm ball. The box it came in says 65cm, the ball has a sticker on it that says 65cm, but I measured it after inflating and it's definitely NOT a 65cm ball: it's a 55cm ball, which is one size down. I've re-measured it several times to confirm, and will be returning the product since it's too small for me.I'll find another vendor to order my 65cm ball from, since I can't trust TKO to send me the correct size next time, either. Definitely a disappointment."
4,Having a ball!,"I actually purchased two of the fitness balls for my mini horse to play with in the pasture. He plays with it all the time, kicking it around like a soccer ball. Sometimes he actually picks it up in his mouth, and it has lived up to it's claim of anitburst. So far it has survived month's of rough play with only the occassional replacement of a plug. I was able to order extras from the manufacturer and they were very easy to deal with. It takes a licking and keeps on.........."
1,DO NOT BUY - missing parts and bad customer serivce,"I purchased this item and received it 2 days later via Amazon Prime. Like many other people who have purchased this ball, the plug was missing from the box. I emailed TKO and heard back the next day that they would send me some plugs. It is 12 days later, and still no plugs. Seems like a reoccuring problem with this item; disappointed in the customer service."
2,Not 65cm,"There's nothing wrong with this fitness ball except that it's NOT 65cm. It's 55cm. They should take out their tape measure. So, it's fine for smaller frames, but if you're looking for something larger, it's not your product. Of course, now I don't trust the advertising. I mean, this thing even says ""65"" on the ball and it's just wrong."
2,Incomplete purchase,"I received this item without the plugs for the air holes -very frustrating. I should have read other reviews to see this is a common experience with this vendor. Luckily I was able to return it through amazon & get the correct item within a week or so. But these exercise balls should be shipping correctly the first time! Now that I have the item, it works fine.Thank you!Lisa"
2,Too Small,I ordered this size because I wanted it to use at my desk at work. I used a co-workers ball - same size but different manufacturer and his was very comfortable and was the right size for my height. This one is about 2 inches shorter and that really makes a difference when I try to use it to sit on. I've put about as much air in it as I feel comfortable doing and I won't be using it as it hurts my back when I do. Very disappointed.
5,Outstanding Quality!,"This ball is so durable and thick I can't see ever bursting it! It is durable and much better quality than I ever expected in an exercise ball. While I use a battery powered pump (and then the hand-pump that came with it for the last air to insure it is fairly tight and full) the hand-pump that comes with it is MUCH better than previous foot pumps that usually come with exercise balls. All-in-all, a great exercise ball and great hand-pump! I got my dollars worth and more with this."
5,strong,"seems to be very strong, im about 290 myself and it has no problem holding my weight, pretty good size to, could be used as chair"
3,"One was good, one not so much","I ordered 2 of the TKO 75 cm balls, both are labeled as 75 cm but one is about to explode at about 60 cm. The one that isn't the right size is also very out-of-round. Not sure what is going on here, but it looks like this isn't uncommon judging from other reviews. I'm looking to outfit my classroom with these instead of chairs, and with the unreliability here, I'm not sure if it is worth the good price to be unsure of what I will receive. I'll probably be going with another brand."
4,"Very Good, Sturdy Ball","I was worried that this exercise ball might be too thin. When we received it and inflated it, it was easy to see that it was very strong and made of heavy plastic. It comes with a pump and two corks. It also gives you a very large booklet that shows what exercises to do.One problem is that, like other reviewers said, the ball's diameter does not reach 65 inches. Its somewhere between 55 and 65, but maybe the estimate was based on very overinflated ball? Either way, this is a good ball."
3,Good ball...no plug! Just a fluke?,"I bought this as an office chair. The ball came via super saver shipping...well packaged etc. with a pump as described. But there was no plug to use after I pumped it up! I'm thinking this was just a fluke, and I'm lucky a friend had an extra. Otherwise, quality was great."
5,good one for the money,this is a very tough ball. i am not exactly a small guy and it did not yet budge. consider this one if you are looking for one.
4,"So far, so good...","I haven't had it for that long, only about a couple of months, but it serves it's purpose. Not only have I used it to exercise, but my cat actually clawed at it, and it is still inflated. So for now, I got exactly what I expected."
4,Good fitness ball,Nice durable ball. Was very easy to blow up. Would recommend to anyone looking for a fitness ball.
1,No plug!,I received this stability ball 2 days ago and it did not have a plug with it. I sent it back to Amazon and ordered a replacement. I got the new ball today and it doesn't have a plug either! I will be returning this ball and buying from a different manufacturer.
1,Ball = FAIL,"Such a simple thing as a ball, how can this purchase screw up? The plug! The plug was missing, absent, not in the box. Got a poster to see what I could do with the ball if it held air, got a ridiculous pump to put the air in, but nothing to hold the air in the orb. Had to think through the problem, went to the TKO site and no plug instructions, no plug replacement part, no plug for the plug at all. Reading through other reviews, I am not the first, though with this review, I hope to be the last. Don't buy it unless the exercise planned is using the hand pump to continuously pump it up."
1,No Plug,"I am another customer who received a package without the plug. Based on the other reviews, it seems that it is a consistent problem with this manufacturer. It's definitely frustrating to order a product that doesn't come with everything you need to use it."
5,Great price and a great purchase,"I've now had my yoga ball for 3 months, and I've sat on it every day. I'm a large man, 6 foot tall and over 300 lbs, and I have never had a problem with this product. I've just added air to it for the first time since I got it!As for the reviews saying that it's smaller than they think... you're not filling it all the way up! When you think it's full, it will hold a bunch more... fill it till it's the right size! If this can hold my weight FULLY inflated, you're not going to pop it just inflating it to the proper size! Oh, and to make it easier, I use the exhaust port of my shopvac to quickly fill this!I have noticed less lower back pain and more abdominal muscle mass since I've been using this ball, I'm ordering an extra one for my work!"
5,Too quality!,Using electrical air pump makes blowing it up effortless. Package include extra air plug. Handles my 200 pounds easily. Comes with a illustrated exercise sheet.
4,I had no issue pumping this to the correct size. It only took me about 5-8 minutes to pump.,"I just received this ball and followed the directions exactly. I had no issue pumping this to the correct size. Actually, I was able to pump it to larger than 75cm when measured. Of course it's probably not 75cm when in use.I planned to use this as my desk chair, but I found that I'm still sitting too low. I'm 5'9, and my regular desk chair sits at 60cm.If anyone knows of a chair that really works, let me know. I've read so many mixed reviews on these chairs. Also, I haven't read one where anyone has tried to use the chair with a 75cm ball. The balls that come with the chairs are more like 55cm. I'm wondering if anyone has tried a 75cm sized ball with a chair or stand."
4,Good -- I bought too small.,"The ball was easy to inflate, though the plug was a little had to put in. I need the next larger size, for core work, but I'm using this for other stuff -- love it."
1,Doesn't inflate well,I ordered in 2 different sizes. Neither of them inflated all the way and remained soft. I used the pump that it came with. The second balls I ordered looked used too. And the only color that was available was steel grey that looked very drabby in person.
1,Was not the size expected,"I purchased this exercise ball and as others have pointed out, it definitely was not the 65cm size as shown. I had to go through the trouble of returning it. And though amazon's return policy is decent in this case, I still had to pay $1 out of pocket at the UPS because I did not have the proper tape to seal the box."
1,Too small. False advertising. NOT a 75cm,This ball is barely 55cm after blow up. Very disappointed. False advertising. I expected better with this. Havent been able to sue it since I bought it and I came online to buy another one today. I figured I should provide my review in case I can save someone else their $$$
1,I didnt get the plug included,I received the product today when i tried to use it i just found out there is no air plug includedthe product without air plug its west of money
4,Fitness Ball,"I bought the TKO Anti Burst Fitness Ball. It works great! Comes with air pump, that took no time to pump up. The only problem that for some reason it didn't come with the plug, to keep air in the ball, that it was suppose to. Amazon wasn't able to give me a replacement. But I was able to find another company that was able to send me a plug kit that fit perfectly. 'You can buy the plug kit here [...]"
1,Not even close to the advertised size,Box is marked 75cm but the true of the ball received was more like 45cm.Returning it.
1,POOR QUALITY,"I bought this ball 61 days ago. I use it to sit at my desk. After 61 days it deflated. I did not puncture it in any way. When I went to return it the refund policy states that I can only get partial credit. In addition I have to pay non-refundable shipping charges to send the ball back to get partial credit. I plan to throw it in the trash as I know the partial credit will be eaten up by the shipping charges. I would think that a reputable manufacturer would want its product returned for two reasons: 1. to ascertain the source of the problem and find a solution to prevent it from happening to future customers and 2. to keep me, this customer a TKO buying customer. I'm out! Mike"
3,"Ball good, pump terrible","The ball looks good and seems to be holding air, the pump on the other hand has only let me get the ball up to about 70% inflation it leaks constantly and I have to kind of cup my hand over the end for it to even start displacing air. I will need to find another pump to finish inflation."
3,"Papa, mama and baby ball","I purchased 3 of the exact same 75cm ball for me and my coworkers to use as chairs in our office. If I only ordered 1, I would have no idea about the inconsistency and would have given it an extra star however since we were able to compare the 3 balls, it only gets 3. Once the balls were blown up to be relatively the same size diameter, one ball felt tight and at it's ""max"" while another ball looked very limp so we blew it up to be as tight as the others and it was 20% bigger and still didn't feel like it was at it's ""max"" And one at 75cm felt just right. Individually, they are fine for it's purpose. Definitely glad I bought a ball that came with a pump, easy to use and blow up."
3,Too small,"As many others have written, the sizing chart on amazon is incorrect. At 5'6"", this ball was way too small. I even measured it, and believe it's under the 55cm diameter listed (closer to 50cm). Coming out of the package, it just looked too small, and unfortunately, blowing it up all the way didn't magically make it any larger. Personally, I think it would only be comfortable for someone under 5'4"", especially if you have longer legs. It feels sturdy, is well made, and was easy to inflate- so I'll be returning it for a larger ball."
4,Great yoga ball!,"The ball is very durable and I love that the rubber is not too thin or slick. The ball does deflate a little after each use, but that is to be expected. Great quality!"
1,Burst Before Even Being Used!,"I purchased these to use as a seat at work. Following instructions, I inflated to 80% to allow it to cure, put the stopper in, and walked away. Within two minutes it blew into two halves - loudly. Didn't cost enough to bother returning, but will never buy this brand again."
4,TKO Anti Burst Fitness Stability Ball (65 cm),"It's a great piece of exercise equipment. I especially like it for squats and crunches. It is lower to the ground than I expected it to be. Perhaps a sizing chart with these (recommended for a person 5'2"" to 5'4"" tall) would be helpful in deciding size. If height wouldn't work, perhaps leg length/inseam would work.I do love this equipment but would like it better if it were larger."
1,Good Ball but leaking pump!!,"The ball is in good quality and I didn't have the missing parts problem. However, I can't inflate the ball to full size because of the leaking pump!!Others said that the yoga ball comes with a good pump, that's why I bought it. So disappointed!!!!"
4,"Very large ball,","I am 5'11 and I find this ball to be pretty large. Other reviewers said the 65cm ball was small, so I got the larger ball. It includes a small pump which I spent quite a long time pumping this thing up. After you get it blown up it's pretty good, but I must say, just pumping up the ball to be nice and firm is a arduous workout. Oh...and after a few months it starts deflating, but that's pretty standard for most inflated things..."
2,Decent performance; not what I wanted,"I've used the MacAlly 100F since 2005 -- the firewire only version of this product. I've had great experiences with it and enjoy the performance. No noisy fans, a solid aluminum enclosure to conduct heat away, and the drives power down when not in use. I can leave the device on 24/7 and never worry about it. When the OS needs something, the drives spin up and deliver and spin down later.This 100A USB only product will not spin down the drive. This puts the hard disc confined in a small place to bake itself meaning the user now needs to worry about either reduced lifetime or manually unmounting and powering down the device when not in use and again powering it up before using it. I had hoped to have all the advantages of the 100F except on my NAS (Time Capsule, which only has USB). Alas, this is not the device I hoped for."
5,covers all the typical things plus more,"The divine triangle is an excellent book also. This one however includes pinnacle and challenge info The divine does not. I have seen a number of numerology books and The Secrets of Numbers is excellent. It provides charts so you can transfer the info of how your day, week, month, and year is going to go, right onto your calendar. Good way to open your awareness in the morning. Other numerology books dont use this info( pinnacle and challenge times) very often, it is worth the price on that alone for me."
1,Useless junk!,"At first, I was very excited to find cross-cut steel nail files! This grooming staple has disappeared from the market in the last few years, to be replaced with non-steel files which shred rather than groom my nails. Was also pleased the seller shipped immediately.Alas, my simple joy was crushed at the first attempt to use these. Might as well just file with the smooth end. The ""files"" are of such poor quality its astounding...doesn't file at all as the cross-cuts are badly made and just slip across the nail surface. I don't get this, making a nail file should not be rocket science. Very very very poor product. The only reason I rated it as high as ""1"" is because the system won't allow a negative number of stars. Guess I'll have to keep my tried and true 6 yr old Revlon cross-cut steel nail file going for a while longer!"
1,Does not file,"Grafco 5"" Stainless Steel Triple Cut Nail File, Box of 12This is a nail file that does not file. A call to Medex was no help. Dina offered to give me the Manufacturers address. She established that there were flat areas between the teeth (the reason that it would not file). A bargain if you only want to clean under your nails. The description is deceptive, should be ""Steel Nail""Doug"
1,stainless steek nail files,these files were made in china and they were partialy incised .but were not capable of filing anything. i returned them to the seller and they refunded on my debit card .
1,get something else,"I got this for my sons -- one likes the steam train sound and the other likes wind chimes. There are many choices with this clock, so we got one to try. The clock part works. The rotating dial to select the sounds is VERY difficult to control. Also, the background noise of the machine running (static) is so bad we couldn't hear our selected sound very well. We're still looking for a replacement for our Sharper Image ones which have locked up. This one is going to the trash or the thrift store, not on our next trip!"
1,Travel Alarm clock,"I purchased this as a gift. It arrived in a timely manner however broke after one night of use. Thankfully, the person I bought it for had gotten another similar clock at the same time. She's still talking to me as ""it's the thought that counts""."
1,"Shameful Job on Michelle Wie, Hamburger !","Go ESPN, Golfweek, Golfdigest, Golf Channel website and see for yourself what this slimy so-called reporter did to 16 years old kid."
4,I like 'em,These were nice to wear. I wore them so much they are ripped to shreds! That's how much I liked them :)
2,Ouch,"These looked like comfortable shoes, and although VERY cute, I got a blister when I wore them which was about 3-4 weeks ago. I still have the blister on my heel. Ouch!!"
5,"Finally, for lovers of 70's music","I was searching during 12 years this album in cd format. Even when the most important songs of this album were originally recorded in the soundtrack 'Good Bye Girl ', this material contains some of the Best songs like Suite clouds rain (8:40 version), Ann, Lorilee and Sail around the world. Nobody who likes David's music should miss it. I hope in the near future I could find in cd format another unforgetable album of David Gates, 'Take me now '."
4,Bread Alone,"Better than most Bread albums, this was more consistent and actually contained some pleasant surprises. Yeah, his music was never cutting edge but it seems a shame to dismiss it as soft rock/middle of the road dreck. True, a lot of the '70s ""MOR"" stuff hasn't aged well but generally, this has. Much of that is a tribute to Gate's strong sense of melody and (as one of the previous reviewers points out) the musicianship on this outing. He's in top form in both departments here. ""Clouds"" (one of those pleasant surprises) still knocks me out. However, there are still uneven moments and occasionally the lyrics seem forced. Nevertheless, there is much to recommend ""First"" -- especially if you liked Gates' finer contributions to Bread."
5,david gates first,I owned this as an albumn when it first came out it is a great record. everyone should check it out.
4,Sunday Rider,"It's great to FINALLY see David Gates releases on cd. I had the 45 of The Goodbye Girl, but, the flip side was my real favorite called Sunday Rider, which is on this cd. I still have the 45 to this day, and it will be great to hear the song in digital format."
4,"Breaking out of ""Bread""","For anyone who was a big fan of the ""soft rock"" of Bread in the 70's, the firstDavid Gates solo album sounds at once familiar, and yet at the same time, a littledaring! Songs such as Sail around the world"" should feel happily familiar to a Bread fan,but he stretches a bit on a song like ""Lorilee"" which has a wonderful jazz feel to it.It is obvious that the masterpiece of the album, and of Mr. Gates career is ""Suite:Clouds andRain"". The well over 8:00 composition is beautifully played, excellently sung, and melodicallygorgeous. And then, just when you think it is totally an orchestrated masterpiece, the drums and thesynths remind you that he also used to do songs scuh as ""Mother Freedom""! If you are ambitious, and a fanbuy this abum..you will truly enjoy it."
5,Healing music for little ones,Great music for young children. Wonderful way to introduce music and ways of calming the mind and body.
1,read 'the world is flat' instead,"this book is very similar in scope and theme with the world is flat, you may almost think one copied from the other, but this book's info and presentation are much inferior, the world is flat is a much more enjoyable and informative read"
3,Better editing would have helped!,"Interesting points throughout concerning globalization and how the world can benefit from an integrated economy without barriers like tariffs and quotas. Anything else I can say that is good about this book has already been said. Good substance, but bad delivery.As I read through this book, I was astounded by the number of incomplete thoughts and missing points. More often than not, i needed to reread certain sections just to be sure I didn't miss a point, only to discover, he didn't intend to make one. He also repeats himself, over and over and over again.Again, sound subject matter, but bad delivery. For a better understanding of issues discussed, read this book in conjunction with:The End of PovertyThe World is FlatBottom BillionWhite Man's Burden"
5,FANTASTIC DIVAS,"I caught the last end of this performance on PBS in Flint, Mi and am I happy I did. I had never heard of these ladies until then. I called the university and then went on line to see how I could obtain this video and ordered this, but another two. I am definitely happy I did. the DIVAS are the ""bomb"". Great entertaining. I recommend these videos to persons of the ""baby boomer"" generation who are not into the rap scene. Enjoy -- I still am."
2,Very avant-garde,"I teach ballet and plan on doing Cinderella as our show this year, involving children ages 4-20. I bought this video so that I could show pieces to my classes so they could see how the story is told through movement. I was very disappointed that I will not be able to do that. The costumes are inappropriate to show to classes of children because the fairy godmother's costume is completely sheer ALL over. Also the story line is not that of the classic Cinderella ballet. None of the seasonal fairies were included. I still gave it two stars because the choreography and dancing were quite beautiful. I enjoyed watching it myself, but it isn't appropriate for my purposes."
5,Gift for my 6 year old granddaughter,My granddaughters ballet teacher suggested I get some ballet dvd's since she is such a lovely little ballerina. She loved both Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and watched them in their entirety. Its really a beautiful production.
1,Distasteful Disaster,"Expecting a classical rendition of Cinderella, I was more than disappointed when receiving a ""contemporary"" version of Cinderella that was ""animalistic"" and in many cases downright disgusting. I assume the dancers themselves have been classically trained; they are very capable and talented, and execute the moves flawlessly, but I had such a hard time seeing past the crude dancing to really value their artistic merits. This ""ballet"" left me feeling uncomfortable, agitated and empty."
4,MISTY EYES,"you know when i read any of beverly lewis'amish books i cry with great compassion, envy and love for all the characters. i can't stop reading these fantastic love stories. i only wish it were me in the stories. my horse ferrier is amish and i share much of what i read with him and he does verify what really happens in the amish world. i have the best of both worlds, my amish ferrier and beverly lewis.thank you so much for these stories.roxanne kuehling"
2,Disappointed,An earlier work. Craftmanship lacking and plot seems contrived. Some beautiful discriptions of natural world of Amish - were repeated almost word for word.Her later works - Abram's Daughters and Seasons of Grace are very much improved and they drove me to continue delving backwards to read her earlier work. How much I enjoy Beverly Lewis and she has spurned me on to read other authors and non-fiction books about the Amish. This book and Sanctuary are not examples of her fine writing and ability to capture Amish life and faith.
3,"Okay, but not like the movie","The book was very good, but not like the movie version. I think I liked the book version better, but guess Hollywood had a better idea."
4,What would you do?,"What would you do if the sister you haven't really seen in 12 years dies, and has decreed in her will that you are to be the guardian of her 5 kids? Sarah Cain has to find that out for herself. This is a marvelous book of self-discovery. Sarah has to finally decide which is more important--money or family.A wonderful book about overcoming past tragedy and understanding what family really means."
1,Sarah Cain should have died with the original Cain,"I liked Beverly Lewis' other books, but I really hated this one. The main chracter is insufferable, and extrememly unlikable. The kids in the book are all right, but the book itself took forever getting off. Good luck getting through this one!"
2,An easy and sometimes dull read,"This book is outlined on the back cover. Read it, you've read the book. I tried to endure every word but was bored by the content so I started flipping through. Ending was sappy and too quickly resolved. This is my first book by this author and I'm afraid I need something a little more action packed. I didn't care for Sarah and wondered why Bryan had put up with her all these years. The whole story seems far-fetched."
2,"Sweet, but Predictable","In the past, I have really enjoyed Beverly Lewis's books about the Amish people and the Plain life. Somehow this book just did not catch my interest from the beginning although I waited for it to be published and rushed right out to buy it. The story is so predictable that it actually is a bit boring. There is no sub-plot, so with the information that you are given in the beginning of the book, it's a no-brainer to figure out exactly what is going to happen. I was disappointed in this effort by Ms. Lewis."
4,"cute, short, and fun addition to the series","Princess Mia is celebrating Christmas in Genovia with her Grandmere, father, and her visiting best friend Lily and boyfriend Michael. A touch of the Gift of the Magi and some soap opera in the form of rebellious Lily, the short novella is an nice addition to the series. It's interesting to see this wonderful heroine in the country she will one day rule. Grade: A-"
2,Awful,"This gets two stars because Mia and Grandmere are always funny. However, the ending (which I won't spoil) was so cliched that it made me cringe. If Meg Cabot had written an original story, this might have gotten four or five stars."
5,A cute Princess Diaries Christmas story.,"Mia is spending Christmas at the palace in Genovia, and she is excited because her boyfriend, Michael, and her best friend, Lilly, will be visiting for the first time the country Mia will someday rule. She's also excited because she thinks she has finally found the perfect present for Michael, an original, near-mint condition Star Wars poster. But when Michael and Lilly arrive, disaster strikes, as Lilly causes trouble and refuses to follow the rules. Will Mia still be able to have the perfect Christmas? The many fans of Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries book are sure to love this cute and funny Christmas story about Princess Mia. It's rather short, but still a fun read for the holiday season."
3,"Pretty good, but too short","The story was cute, but it was way too short. Meg does best when she can flush out her characters a bit more. This short story gave us just a small tid bit and was sort of just a small bit of fluff. I love Meg's writing and her characters and would rather she just focus on doing quality pieces."
5,Great Book.,My daughter is a HUGE fan of the princess diaries. This is a well written book. She loved it. Thanks
2,Needs reorganized,"Slovene is a tough language to learn, and this book doesn't help. Although there is a wealth of information, it is not well organized. Hard to get through."
3,Not well organized,"It's accurate as far as I can see, but hard to find the phrases you're looking for. And not easy to tell how to pronounce, not as easy as, say, a Berlitz book."
1,Never buy from Tiger Direct,"They messed up on my order and will not accept the blame for it! They will not do anything to rectify the situation, except refund my money after several weeeks. I was put on hold for ever! Asked to speak to manager and they do not seem to really care.Never by from TIGER DIRECT, bad customer service!"
4,For my dad,This was a gift for my dad and he loved it. Hard to find. Great price. He was very happy.
1,"Hurt, BAD BAD design","I bought this from amazon, now I'm stuck with them, waited 2 weeks too long to return,"
2,Poor choice of readers.,"Did not like the sound of the readers voice. Too matronly for a romance novel, even if the heroine WAS a little older. The voice was distracting from the story."
2,A favorite author but not one of her best,"Even though I usually love JAK, this book did nothing for me. Predictable, flat characters, boring.Elope Aviator Brown HatYou've got to get one of these hats."
2,"Irritating, grating heroine. Terrible ending.",Interesting story line. Badly written and developed. Absolutely terrible ending.
5,My vacations are never this good!,"I don't know what book the rest of you guys were reading, but I LOVED this book! Jared and Kathryn were just hilarious together. Kathryn wasn't too hard-edged--she was stressed out! That was the whole point of the vacation that starts the whole plot moving forward. Jared pushes all her buttons and their ""arguments"" are pure romantic comedy. Kathryn de-stresses really quickly--like by day 2!--and then it's just romance and and lots of excitement with just enough sexy banter to keep me grinning. Sure, it's not a ""deep"" read, but I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours."
3,"IPromising opening, but this really doesn't deliver.","I enjoyed early scenes with the heroine, but the plot really didn't develop. There seemed to be no reason for these two characters to get together other than that they were in the same place at the same time. The hero had appeal, but it was hard to really cheer on the heroine. In the dark moment of crisis, I didn't really care if it all ended. The heroine's concern seemed a bit petty so she didn't deserve to get the love of her life. All this said, it's not a terrible story if you like romance...but I was able to people watch, accept room service, and call home to check on the kids. A pleasant diversion, but not riveting."
2,Annoying character Kate Inskip,"I usually enjoy most of Ms. Krentz books. However, this book lacks Ms. Krentz's talent. The author keeps describing the character Kate Inskip as a ""prickly broad"". Personally, I see this character as an ""extremely annoying shrew"", and that's putting it mildly!!! Throughout this entire book there is never an opportunity to even like the character of Kate Inskip. She is a very poor example of an independent professional woman. The only thing that is stopping me from giving this book 1 star is the character of Jare Hawthorne-- he's one of the few good points of this book."
2,Jayne's first obnoxious heroine.,"I have read almost all of Ms. Krentz's books under all her names. The very best thing about her stories is that either you wish the heroine was one of your best friends, or you hope you are like her. This Kate Inskip (what an uncomfortable name to read) is just a whining, nosey, spoiled creep. This is no-one I would ever want to know. At one time, I laughed out loud at how unreasonable she was, and wondered what Jared could POSSIBLY see in this woman. I hope this isn't a new trend, since no matter the quality of the story, you can always like the characters in Jayne's books. (Oops, I'm forgetting some ridiculous creature named Philadelphia Fox. That was the one and only Krentz novel that I didn't finish, and can barely remember). The Pirate is not a great book by any standards. I've been reading it for a couple weeks, it's so easy to put down."
5,excellent Temptation,"I first read this book as a Harlequin Temptation a decade ago, and it's one of the very few I've hung on to. The writing is tight and fast-paced, and the relationship is deliciously steamy. Watching the characters match wits and wills is a kick. One of the best books Jayne Ann Krentz has written, in my opinion. If you like category romances, I highly recommend this one. (The second book in this series, The Adventurer, is also especially good.)"
2,Very little substance.,I continue to find that her other titles under Amanda Quick are far more satisfying. Sketchy character portrayal and a plot that barely kept me interested. The mystery itself was given short shrift and it could have provided the necessary spark to the book if it was developed further. Pretty mediocre effort.
2,"Pretty thin book, pretty thin plot, heroine must be thin!","This was the first Krentz book I have read that I have just been ABLE to put down. Ms. Inskip (what a name, and do we all have to be referred to as MS to show we have a job and and life?) was a poorly drawn character, one wonders why anyone would fall in love with her at all. She just had nothing going on! The kid was great, the hero was just OK, the setting was weird (where IS this?) and my advice is just to skip this one. I don't think that there was a lot of thought put into this one at all. Better to read ""Trust Me,"" ""Grand Passion,"" ""Family Man,"" or ""Sharp Edges."" Go get these titles instead."
5,The Bible for Cap Gun Collecting,Outstanding compilation of cap guns and prices in 1996. Great reference when evaluating a purchase of a vintage cap gun at this time.
2,I thought it would be much better,This memoir had so many outstanding reviews that I was excited to begin reading it..but I found only parts of this book interesting. As I read it my mind you wonder to the next memoir I wanted to read..I did finish it completely AND I have moved on to other memoirs since.
4,Good introduction of fundamentals,This book does a good job teaching the basics of flower arranging. I am now able to read other books about flower arranging that I didn't understand before
3,flower3,enjoyed book was very helpful just wished for more information. Seemed a little outdated and reasources limited.
3,"Nice utensil holder, but...",The glue used to attach the instructions to the back of the holder made this purchase less than desirable. I didn't find this to be the brightest idea. It took less than a minute to open the box and remove the holder from the plastic bag. My frustration came when I removed the cardboard instructions that were GLUED to the back of the item. A trail of pieces of cardboard and glue residue remains. I'll have to find another solution later after my aggrevation subsides. I'd return it if it wouldn't cost me more money and additional time.
2,"Well made, BUT...","A well constructed product, but there are two problems -- one minor one major. The minor one is that the dividers actually cut down on the number of tools it could have held w/o them. The major problem is much more serious, and has it's roots in something too few people consider when buying kitchen tools, and that is ease of cleaning! In this case, the dividers are such that washing out the interior would be very difficult & time consuming. You're better off with something like the ceramic pot/tool holder from Le Creuset, or the ""lazy Susan"" tool holder from OXO. I'm returning this one.OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Rotating Utensil HolderLe Creuset Stoneware Large 2-3/4-Quart Utensil Crock, Blue"
5,Buy this product.,"Drying tableware is a pain in the butt; especially sharp knives. I loved this product so much that I ended up buying a second one. Now I have 2 of them and they do the trick! So buy two of them for you, and two for your favorite cook for Christmas or a birthday or Mother's Day."
4,Piece of cake and great value!,"Bought this to enclose an extra 2.5 inch drive, clone my dying laptop drive, and then swap out. Couldn't be easier. The only structural complaint is are the two small plastic flanges on the back plate which you remove. One was already split by the securing screw. It still holds, but it would be nice if this was sturdier. Nice touch to include two extra little screws in case you lose the first ones. Also nice to have a short Firewire cable included along with USB.Highly recommended"
4,Just what I was looking for,"Nice, very handdle but you have to use a screw driver each time you want swap disks, unless you just put the HD inside without using the screws. Not overheating and very nice shape."
2,Unique ID isn't unique,"This is an OK enclosure to invest in if you are positive that you will never need more than one, but if you ever plan to add another, beware. MacAlly ships every unit with the exact same internal GUID, in violation of the FireWire standard. The GUID is supposed to be unique for every device, so your computer can tell them apart, but these aren't -- so as soon as you add the second one, your machine goes bonkers. If you spend enough time on the phone with MacAlly support (a task in itself) they will deign to send you a low-level tool to rewrite the GUID in one of the enclosures -- however, it runs only on Windows, and even then, not on all versions of Windows. By the time you have reached this point, there are other enclosures on the market at roughly the same price point that are a whole lot less grief to set up."
2,Very Poor shock protection,The hard aluminum outer case is in direct contact with the drive. Shock is mercilessly transmitted to the drive it protects. I dropped mine and instantly kill the drive inside. The Western Digital external drive enclosure has rubber all around the drive for protection and. FIrewire on this works great on a Mac.
1,"Macally USB 2 EXT Storage Enclosure for 2.5 "" HDD","This one is not user friendly at all.the documentation that come with device are not clear.the tech support is so so.Plug & Play, this one is not."
4,I'm still using it!,"I've been using this for years now. Perfect for my upgraded notebook hard drives. The only issue I have with it is that you need a separate power source to power the drive in USB mode (another USB power cable or plug-in cable). This is not the case for Firewire connections. This means more cables to carry. Other than that, it's a good 2.5"" hard drive enclosure."
4,"Excellent construction & performance, but lacks a power supply","Unfortunately some harddrives draw more power (>500mA?) than USB can provide, so an external power supply is necessary. For the price (around $40 from Amazon), a power supply should be included.Otherwise the design and construction are quite nice, and Firewire performance is fine."
4,Better than expected,the video and audio was better than I expected. Clear and crisp audio. My SVS sub reallty did a good job on the double bass. The video quality was very good considering done in the 80's
5,Intensely moving,Being the mother of 3children and a divorcee and having experienced the same depths of unhappiness that Jesse has I could feel her despair and her ultimate desire to bring an end to her pain. The pathos of an ill mother trying to save her daughter's life is extremely touching. The ending is magnificent.
2,Didn't watch it,"Movie came fast, but I didn't pay attention to the fact that it was VHS. I don't have a VHS player, so I never watched it. Donated it to library."
5,Laughed Heartily,"A delightful read and a must-have for any animal lover or pet owner. I laughed until tears came to my eyes. Keepsake for always, as well as a fantastic gift for anyone who loves cats. The man was a legend with a brilliant mind and sharp wit. I highly recommend this book..and the entire series of Polar Bear books, as well as his other works."
3,MRCatLuvr,"This book starts off slow, continues slow, and ends slow. Therefore it is not a very fast read. I would suggest it only for people who are extremely into cats or extremely bored out of thier minds. Although boring, the book has some insiteful facts. If you find it interesting to read about the life of a cat and scenes from the past of it's curmudgeon owner than this book would be great for you."
3,Slow read,I loved the idea of this book and I love what the author has done with his farm in Texas. But this story drug on forever. It's just not interesting. I found myself wanting to pick up another book.I love animals and was happy to hear about Mr. Amory's work with animals rights. But I didn't find the book interesting.
1,Too Simplistic and Nothing New,"This was divided into parts and each part was very very simplistic. This was recommended to me for parent training and I found that it was very common sense oriented and very hard to attend too. I listened to it over and over and due to the material had a hard time focusing. Once I heard it all, I thought that a different presentation with more practical material might have been more useful. For the amount of material, it was a waster of money."
2,"Interesting theory, not readily usable","I very much appreciate that people follow their natural way of doing their work and that their internal wiring also determines the type of work they will likely do. I quite like the dialogue approach to explaining the theory as well as the practical application. Nonetheless, I find the concepts to be difficult to ""hold on to"" and apply. I want tools that are immediately applicable and useful in interacting with colleagues and teams. This model is not immediately applicable nor easily used in this context."
1,not much more than an infomercial for website products,"Though a few tidbits of encouragement may be picked from this book, I found the oversimplified and unlikely dialogue between two strangers a mind-numbing format. The ""meat"" behind Kathy Kolbe's philolosphy is condensed into a few pages of academic style writing at the end of the book. Most frustrating though was the contstant reference to the results of a personality test that was NOT included in the book, but could be found on-line......for $49.95.Your instinct should tell you to not waste your time on this book."
1,One major flaw!!,"Judging from the other reviews, this book contains some interesting information, but I couldn't get past page ten because the author keeps talking about instinct when it's quite obvious that she means intuition. You'd think that an author who is going to devote a book to one subject would know the proper definition of that subject, but apparently not.If you want a good book on intuition, I'd suggest A STILL, SMALL VOICE by Echo Bodine.I was thinking of donating this POWERED BY INSTINCT book to the local library, but that would mean that I'd be helping to mislead others, so I plan to throw it into a nearby river."
4,nice sound,these have a nice sound. We got Ludacris's Soul and compared them. Better for treble.they get a little uncomfortable after a bit-are a little tight
5,A great addition to anyone's musical entourage,"Perfect. Cord is heavy, but sturdy. Even as a music novice, you can clearly hear a difference. A word of warning, though: it might take a bit to get used to reverberating bass blasting the best sounding music you've heard."
5,Exceptional headphones,Its hard to explain how proud of my purchase of these headphones after much research. I typically listen to mostly R&B and jazz and so I want to hear strong mid-tones but with a heavy but not overwhelming bass. These headphones completely fit the bill and also pretty comfortable considering. Plus they are cheaper than the Dre headphones. Highly recommended!
4,Five wonderful perfumes,"You can't please all the people all the time, right? Well, with this set you might just come close. This gift set contains miniatures (.14 oz.) of five of Estee Lauder's wonderful perfumes. I liked them all, though right now White Linen is my favorite. I think that this makes a great gift, giving a lucky woman in your life a chance to try five quality perfumes. Go for it!(Review of Estee Lauder Spray Favorites Miniature Collection 5pc GiftSet)"
3,Orchid beauty and Book beast,"OKbut not what I was expecting, most of my plants didn't survive using their method as opposed to guidence from actual orchid growers.Some Laelia's did grow using his techniques, whilst other methods from other authors didn't work to laelia's.Which is a good think for this book!!!"
1,where's the hole?,"This ""mug"" is actually a thermos. It requires two hands to use, one for the lid and the other for the mug. The ""drinking hole"" is too small and not positioned for good flow. As well since there are two lids, liquid spills between one and the other. Really, I wish I had not bought this item and that I could return it. Nothing against the seller, the product is just not convenient at all."
1,The worst educational book about native americans.,this book is awful. we are not called indians. We are native americans. this book has so many stereotypes. My grandmother was taken from her family when she was 7 years old. she did not see her family until she was 16 years old. i am truly afended by this book because i am a native american and my family did go through the bording school era. All i have to say is that Michael L. Cooper should have researched more and thought about how we would be afected by this book.
1,Would give it a 0 if I could,"This book is HORRIBLE! If you want to educate yourself or students or children - please skip this book. It will only fill your head with inaccurate and stereotypical information. This book is poorly researched and written without any Native American input at all (I know this is true because when asked during an interview if he talked to Native people about their experiences, he said Native people dont want to talk about it). He writes only from collected pieces of information that cover up boarding school crimes such as molestation, severe abuse and murder. Boarding schools were not happy times. Just because some great people came out of it does not mean it benefited them - it just means that these children would survive anything thrown at them. PLEASE do not read this book to children! Please!"
4,Just right,Quick and easy to use. For price and functionality it was great. I was able to get data off a failing drive and now use it as a back-up drive.
5,nothing better captures the quintessence that is ny,"If nothing else, NY is a triumph of the human spirit. Metropolitan Diary has been the daily log of those shining moments that define the NY spirit - a spirit whose studied nonchalance and casualness is nothing more than the New Yorkers' sense that nothing is impossible. These excerpts bring tears of laughter and association as you journey through the human story that is NY. Individually these fleeting glances of NY show us vignettes that are warm and wonderful. But collectively, these stories become a living treasury that you hope never ends. If you understand what NY is all about, then this collection belongs on your shelf."
5,Finally!!,I am happy to finally find a fresh and definitive research on the origins of the Human Race on this Planet. An eye opener for the masses!! Another great read is on ancient Sumer(Z.Sitchin). Can you handle the real truth of our origins? The powers that be are quickly losing their grasp and control of us due to Scientific Studies such as Forbidden Archaeology's Impact. Special thanks to Michael Cremo and staff for their great service to the World and the Earth Humans.
4,A lot that has been hidden is revealed by the truth,"This book is really interresting to read, mainly because of all the hidden truth that has been kept secret by evolutionists."
5,Exciting document from the early years of the Esperanto,"This translation into Esperanto is based upon the abridged version of Robinson Crusoe from 1908 (Altemus Young People's Library Edition). It contains several beautiful illustrations from the edition of 1908. Translated by A. Krafft (1908), with corrections by Ulrich Becker (2004)."
5,He's done it again,"Daniel - what can be said about this young man....this is the perfect lead in song for him to release from his second CD. While many in the USA will not know the name, it won't take them long to know that this man is the voice of the next generation of pop male artists.With true grit in his voice, pain of love's lost in his heart - he delivers a DIANE WARREN tune like no other male artists has yet to do!Cheers to you Daniel - buy the cd and the single - just so you can hear how music from the heart is DONE RIGHT!"
1,Misrepresented Product,"I wanted a heavy duty 6"" vise. So, after looking through all the vises on Amazon, I decided on the 6"" Mint Craft (Jl25013) which appeared very robust, blue in color, heavy @ 56 lbs. Just what I wanted! (Sold by Toolprice). I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find a Pro-Forge (1342R),very light weight, poor quality, handle held in on each end with rubber washers(never have seen this before), one rubber retainer was already broken, black in color (looked like it had been dipped in tar and then heated to dry) Vise actually weighed 26.4lbs..This is not good! Total junk! I feel someone was trying to make a buck by deception. I would not recommend this seller!"
4,"Simple, but effective","The Pure Putt Mirror is a simple device which gives valuable feedback when practice putting. It allows you to see your eye position as well as the position of your shoulders to ensure a proper stroke ""down the line."""
4,good,"Great book, he does tend to drag just abit as he tries to get the meat of the story line out, but the action is great and detailed you can almost picture the action as he describes it. I am about to start into the third book and hope it is as good as the first two."
4,A pretty good sequel,"As with pretty much all Blizzard books (Starcraft, Diablo, and the other Warcraft series) the second book in the series is sort of a letdown (or the worst of the three). Don't get me wrong, I liked this book very much. I just felt it kind of dragged in the middle. Still this book is definitely worth checking out. It's just that I wish they had more parts with the evil night elves, and the Burning Legion. Like they did in the first book. But despite that this is still a good book to read. And it shows Neltharion's descent into insanity rather well. Richard A. Knaak definitely is a great writer. I just hope the next book The Sundering is the best and tops his best work yet (which in my opinion is Diablo book 3: The Kingdom of Shadow), so yeah definitely check this one out.4 stars"
2,Missing Something,"I enjoyed the first novel in this series enough to read on, but after reading this installment I won't bother with the final book. The problem with this novel is mainly it is simply describing a battle. Although this is understandable since the book is based on a wargame, it still distracts from what should be the main characters. I found I could just skim over several pages at a time because they just were a play-by-play of this battle.Also, the characters are shallow and it hurts the story. It isn't that the characters aren't interesting or without flaws, it's more that they aren't developed.Finally, the story isn't really any different from the first novel. Sure, the situation is different but the plot isn't. It made for a long, boring read.If you are into game-based books you might like it. I'm generally not, and I didn't."
3,Getting a bit basic?,I found that the story got a bit repetitive a continuous two steps forward one step back.The origin of Deathwing was ok though
3,Illden and Deathwing part,"The only good parts that was interesting in this book are:-Deathwing madness and betrayal.illidan Love confession to tyrande, then joined the burning legion, because of his jealousy over Malfurion.The pleage that was stopped by rhonin and brox.The rest was blah blah blah xavius is scary... blah blah blah almighty alexstrasza..... blah blah blah Richard A. Knaak is booooooring!!!!The problem is that the idea of story is good, but Richard A. Knaak was way too slow and boring, i'm hoping the Christe Golden will rewrite the whole story in her way :p"
4,Good book,We use this book as our textbook in class and I think it contains a lot of good grammar exercises and review. There are writing prompts and other short exercises. English is used to explain a lot of the grammatical rules.
3,Handbuch Zur Deutschen Grammatik,Quality of textbook is decent. Provides exercises for basic grammar though the accompanying text book is lacking and doesn't do a very good job explaining the grammar.
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!!,"I thought the idea of this coffee maker was great...especially the price considering you recieve 2 travel mugs and a coffee maker. But don't bother. The first coffee maker filled the mugs unevenly...which caused spills. The second one which I used every morning for 6 months just went into the trash. The mugs exploded, seperated, and I just couldn't take it anymore! So don't bother!"
3,OK for the price -- works best with one mug only,"This coffee maker is not bad for the price & convenience. I do have one issue with the mechanism that distributes the coffee to 2 mugs. At first it worked fine on mine, but after awhile (even after cleaning it) more coffee goes to one mug than the other. So, if you primary fill one mug at a time -- you're good to go, but with 2 you may have problems with even distribution of the coffee."
4,Great Price...Great Item...Great Buy,"We bought this coffee maker because if its convienence factor. We got a bonus in that it makes a great cup of coffee as well! And I never use the cups that came with it anymore! I stick a mug under it (a normal coffee mug) and brew myself a cup of coffee whenever I want. I have had no problems! I am going to end up taking it to work so I can always have a hot cup of coffee. And for the price, you could not ask for more!"
2,Not worth it.,"I have been using the unit since Christmas time now. It was a gift, and I have not brought myself to get another brand/model. I use it only for one cup because it will tend to drip from the center, and all over the counter. I have now had both of the mugs ""Explode"" on me now. The cup heats up as the coffee is brewed, and will cause the air between the metal outside and the plastic liner to expand. The liner will forcefully ""Pop"" up out of the metal shell. I would not recommend it, but it does make good coffee, if you can deal with just one cup."
2,Melitta Take 2 does not make great coffee ...,"I bought this unit to replace a Black & Decker Brew & Go and my old drip coffeemaker. I was disappointed because the brewed coffee was not as hot as it should have been and it was also weak. It also took forever to brew -- 12.5 minutes for a pot! So, if you're looking for a fast cup of coffee that tastes great, try another coffeemaker. My little Brew & Go makes better cup of coffee and it only costs $15-20!"
1,Choose another personal coffee maker,"I just bought this machine and was so puzzled why 2/3 of the water was going into one cup, overflowing, while the other remained half full. I tried it twice, thinking maybe the spout was blocked on one end. After doing two clean-ups, I went online to find other people saying the same thing: the product is defective. Sure, you may want to try to level the machine ""perfectly,"" but who has the time? My table is perfectly flat but it still spilled over one cup - should you need a level reader to make coffee? Should I keep moving it around the table, propping up one side slightly, with multiple spills until I get the right positioning? I do not want to have to monitor the output before I leave for the morning. The whole point of this device for me is/was to get two good cups of coffee, not one, with minimal effort. Disappointing."
2,broke after less than a year,"I had this for less than a year and it just broke. I drink I cup of coffee every day, so I'd say I got about 250 cups out of this before it died. :("
5,Handy,"I use it daily, sometimes several times a day. I can make just enough coffee to get me through the morning and to take to work, or for a cup after supper. Also, I can make my flavored coffee (which no one else in my household likes) while everyone else can have regular coffee in the larger coffeemaker. Easy cleanup as well. I recommend!"
1,Cups do not fill up evenly,"I received the Take 2 as a Christmas gift and decided to try it out tonight to see how it works. Our countertop is pretty level and it only filled one cup. It eventually leaked out all over the countertop, while leaving the other cup less than half full. I will be returning this item and buying something else!!"
5,Revolutionary!!!,"What can I say? I had always admired the more expensve Cuisinart model but recieved this one as a gift. It has completely replaced my old coffee maker. Though designed for on the go, works well around the house too. Keeps coffee hot for well over and hour. Highly recommend!"
2,Makes a great cup,This coffee pot made a great cup of coffee but sure didn't make 2 good cups. The water never came out evenly and I had a mess almost everytime I brewed 2 cups at a time. I was very disappointed because the cups kept the coffee nice and hot for a long period of time.
4,"does the job for dorm or office, but beware of lid!","I live alone and wanted to trade in my full size thermal carafe maker for something smaller. This has worked great-- it's easy to use, easy to clean, you can make one mug or two and the coffee stays hot and tasty. It's just so nice to make a fresh cup whenever I want, rather than drink the cooling dregs from the carafe.There is one significant problem-- the so-called *travel mugs* are fine for use around home. But they're useless in the car. The base is too wide to fit some cup holders. And the lid pops on and off frighteneningly easily; one sharp turn and the lid was on the floor and coffee was flying all over my car. Hopefully they'll fix this in the next version.At such a decent price, I'd still recommend it for the office, dorm or studio. But pour the coffee into a *real* travel mug if you plan to take your java on the road."
3,mugs are cheap,I have owned this item for about a year now. The only thing I do not like about it is the fact that mugs are cheap. One of them fell apart a few months into use and now the remaining one has fallen apart. I have just started looking for replacement mugs so can't report how that experience is yet. Otherwise I will probably use a regular mug and just use another travel mug when I want to take it in the car. I have been happy with everything else about the machine.
5,THE BEST YET,"I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE JUST ENOUGH COFFEE FOR ME, I WAS TIRED OF THROWING BREWED COFFEE OUT AND WAS WASTING MONEY. I TRAVEL TO WORK SO THE MUGS ARE JUST RIGHT, 1 FOR THE MORNING, 1 FOR THE DRIVE. SINCE PURCHASING MINE, OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE PURCHASED AND FEEL THE SAME AS I DO. WITH-IN OUR FAMILY WE HAVE SIX OF THESE. PROBLEM IS THAT THE MUGS HAVE TO BE RETREIVED FROM FAMILY MEMBERS HOMES.THIS IS TRUELY A FANTASTIC PRODUCT!"
1,2 cup brew doesn't work well,"I love the one cup brew, it's fast and makes good coffee. The two cup brew is messy and flows coffee out and it runs down between the mugs. Might be returning this product."
4,Melitta,"Fast, good brewing, auto shutoff, small but attractive profile on countertop. Great for morning commute."
4,We Love it and are Buying Another One.,"All that kept me from giving it five stars is the durability of the cups. We've lost/broken lids and broken the plastic part of the rim. But, we've used them several times a day for a year and a half which is pretty good for a thirty dollar coffee maker.I wish Melitta sold the cups seperately.We haven't had any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers. The coffee goes right into the cups, no mess, no fuss, no bother. Since you use your own coffee, not pods, how good it tastes is up to you."
1,Terrible Product,"I bought this back in September and it's been nothing but problems. I would like to use it every day and i figured that since I live alone the one cup feature would be nice. It would be if the product worked, I is at the point now to get it to make a single cup I have to fill the machine up with water to the very top two or three times and then it takes about 30 minutes to make a cup of coffee. It's loud, the carafe leaks this gray/brown goo and the coffee comes out tasting a little strange. Cleaning it is next to impossible I would NOT recommend buying this product It was a waste of 30 dollars for me."
2,"mugs are bad quality, drips unevenly","I liked the convenience of this coffee maker, however, both mugs soon began to leak. The coffee does not drip evenly, so that one cup may overflow while the other is not yet full.I would not buy this coffee maker, again."
1,An overflowing MESS!,I had the same experience as other reviewers. It does not fill the mugs evenly and results in a horrible mess of coffee overflowing all over the counter! Mine went in the trash. It's a shame because it's a great concept but I'll go back to a regular coffee pot.
1,Do not buy this Coffeemaker,"This coffee maker lasted me all but a month and a half. The mugs fell apart even though I washed them by hand every time and it leaks very easily. Keep your receipt on this one, I didn't and my Target store doesn't carry them any more."
1,Unreliable,Great concept but the coffeemaker started leaking after a few weeks. Pretty soon it was totally useless and we were forced to throw it away.
3,Not Sturdy,"I like the coffee maker, but I suggest using different mugs when making coffee for home. The plastic inside of the mugs has seperated from the steel (by the lip) and now when I wash the cups they fill up with water- Scary the kind of bacteria that can grow between the steel and plastic without my knowledge!This is a great little gadget if you use your own (better quality) mugs."
4,handy for someone on the go,"I take one cup of coffee to work with me in the morning,so I bought this coffeemaker. The price was right. The mugs are nice and sturdy;however, I don't suggest putting them in the dishwasher or soaking them in a sink of water. I probably did both of these things and now I have water swishing around inside my mugs and I cannot get it out. The unit is great b/c you can put in one mug or two. I have learned that I can also put another travel mug or large mug under the spout, instead of the ones supplied with it and it works fine!This does a pretty good job at making coffee and I am pleased that it doesn't have a permanent filter b/c I really have trouble cleaning those--especially since I don't have a garbage disposal. The only downside is that it doesn't keep the coffee warm very long b/c there are no metal warming units under the mugs. It is all plastic--so drink up right away."
2,Not the best,Bought this model and actually returned it 3 times b/c the unit itself leaked water as well as the cups. Washing the travel mugs was a nightmare as if you submerged them in water or dishwasher they held water and when you poured hot liquid in them the water stored leaks out. Would not recommend this unit.
1,Do not buy...,"The marketing and concept is beautiful. The actual machine is a nightmare and heartbreak. I bought the first one and it spilled over everytime. So convinced it was a lemon, I exchanged it for another identical one. The same problem happeded, so I just made one cup at a time. Not even a month later I had to throw out the cups because the plastic interior seperated after having water inside for a couple of weeks. One month later the on light did not work. 2 days later it is dead."
2,Good maybe.....,"I bought this coffee maker for work so I could have a mug to carry around with me if needed. I really like the concept of this coffee maker. The thing I don't like is having to clean up the coffee that has dripped down between the two cups because the coffee drip has converged in the middle rather than dripping out it's individual hole. I would recommend this if you only want to make one cup of coffee. You could go on and make two cups but just put one cup under the spout and switch out to the other when the first one gets full, but then you end up with one strong cup of coffee and one weak. Not to mention that you have to keep your eye on it or the first cup will overflow.All around I would not recommend this particular coffee maker. I would buy another maker's model if I was sure they had desighned it right."
1,Unit dead after @ months,The Melitta made good coffee about 2 months. I had the same trouble as others with the mugs. The plasic cup would seperate from the metal shell when hot coffee is in mugs. It also would make uneven cups with the unit and couter level. The first sign of trouble was the power light and button refused to work. I had to plug in the unit to start brewing and unplug and plug in again to get it to start. Eventually it didnt work at all. I tossed the box and receipt after a month so its a total loss other than the mugs. I am going to look for a similar unit from a different manufacturer. No more Melitta products for me.
1,Gone in 60 days,"I bought this unit and within 60 days I have gone back to a traditional coffeemaker. It is fine for a single person wanting one cup or a couple wanting one cup each but if one person is going to consume that 2nd cup prepare for cold coffee. The mugs are cheap, when the hot coffee fills them the air in the insulating pocket of the mugs expands from heat and blows the inner liner up out of the shell. The concept is good but not the product. Don't waste your money on this gadget."
1,Melitta should be embarrassed,"Melitta should be embarrassed that such a flawed product has not been recalled and is actually still available. Like many of the other reviewers, I find it impossible to make two cups of coffee. Either one cup overfills or the coffee drips down the middle between the two cups and runs all over the counter. I haven't had the ""exploding mug"" experience, but find them so inferior to other travel mugs, I just don't use them. It's surprising to me that the overall rating is as high as three stars."
4,Really good little coffee pot,"I love this. I have never had a single problem with it. I find it easy to use, easy to clean and it makes a very good cup of coffee. I make only one cup about 95% of the time...the few times I've made two cups, I haven't experienced the problems that others have mentioned, it filled both cups evenly. I did actually buy a reusable filter for mine. It took less than 10 minutes and a utility knife and a pair of scissors to trim the top down and cut a notch for the water tubing, but now it works great and no paper filters deal with which makes it an even better pot. The mugs are probably the worst part of the unit, they don't fit the cup holders in my car and they don't have the best lids...but I already have travel mugs, so I just use these to brew and pour it into a better travel mug."
3,Could be better...,"I have had this coffee maker for a few months now. The only complaint I had in the beginning was that there wasn't a permenant filter (you have to use #2 filters). I used to only make one cup at a time and it worked great. Now that I started making 2 cups at a time I can see the problem. One of the cups ALWAYS overflows and the other is half empty. Now I have to stand there and watch it brew so I can remove the cup that fills up faster before it overflows. If you plan on only brewing one cup at a time I would reccomend this, otherwise, keep looking..."
2,Broken!,"I have had this coffeemaker for about a year and use it about twice a week. Although it is on a flat surface, it recently started spilling water. And now the water is not being sucked up properly and so subsequently is unable to dispense any coffee. Without disassembling the whole maker, I cannot figure out what specifically is broken. Good thing it only cost me $27 because it is going into the trash."
3,same as the other two,"i did order these three lilac time cds, from the seller, and they all arrived according to the allotted delivery time frame, but most really good sellers send their stuff quicker and charge less for the merchandise, but i was obsessed and weak the moment i bought them, seeing as this seller had all three in stock. hey whatever, they made out like a bandit thanks to the weakness of the consuming sucker (that's me). i should've held out for cheaper stuff. but hey, all the cds were in good shape at least. don't be a sucker like me..."
1,Insulated plastic glass,"Way over priced. I didn't realize I was only getting one. I bought a set of four for $19.00, and they were just as good. $11.00 for one glass is highway robbery."
3,It's okay,"It's perfect for our family use. Though it doesn't fit our microwave, but the tumbler holds hot liquids quite well."
5,Well made and BIG,Best cups for the freezer and well made compared to others. High price but worth it. Dish washer safe which is great.
5,I love it,"These are such great cups, I take one every day to work, or even when I am just out and about. I love these things. Plus it it more cost effective to purchace them here than at bed bath and beyond."
3,Ok,I love the glasses and I also bought the lids. What I did not purchase were the straws. I did not think I would need them but I have found out that the glasses with the lids on were very hard to drink out of with out pouring it down the front of you. I am not sure I would purchase again. I feel the staws are overpriced and should actually come with the glasses for what you are paying!
4,Love tervis,"Not much to say about this...it's just a cup, but I love how sturdy Tervis tumblers are. I absolutely HATE the price though, but I suppose once you have a full set, you won't need to buy any more for the rest of your life. lol"
1,Convenient but makes water taste horrible,"I use this primarily for water and noticed that after a while of leaving water in it (30mins to an hour) my water has a horrible plastic taste. I have since stopped using it and wondered if I received a defective cup, but even after washing it in hopes that it was just some residue, it still occurs."
2,OK FOR A SHORT WHILE,I WAS EXCITED TO GET THIS IT WAS RECEIVED IN JANUARY 2012 -EXPENSIVE BUT SOUNDED GOOD AND HAD GOOD REVIEWS !!!but!!! HERE I AM MARCH 19TH AND IT SWEATS UP A STORM!! I ONLY WASH IT BY HAND EXCEPT FOR THE STRAWS (TOP RACK DW) ONLY HAVE USED IT FOR ICED TEA AND SOFT DRINKS NEVER ANYTHING HOT. MAYBE YOU HAD BETTER NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY -WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT A SHORT TERM DRINKHOLDER
1,LIFETIME WARRANTY = GOOD UNTIL THEY BREAK (AND THEY WILL),"These tumblers look great.....in the garbage. Our tumbler broke in the dishwasher, must have been a defect. I went to get it replaced through warranty and was meet by a very unhelpful person who just wanted to waste my time. I sent her a photo of the broken tumbler and she asked that i mail it in. Lets see, that will cost me about $10 and then my time and headache. I guess that is what they consider and ""outstanding warranty"". This is how i see it, just by a cheap Chinese made tumbler for $2 and don't worry if it breaks...now that is a warranty.Thanks Tervis for nothing............"
1,Nana@6,"Do not purchase any Tervis products the quality is very poor. When I purchased a water bottle and needed a new lid due to the seal fell out of the lid I was told I had to mail the lid back to Tervis at my expense or I could go to their web site and order a new lid and get free shipping so I wouldn't have to wait 6-8 weeks for the replacement lid. Not sure why it takes 6-8 weeks for them to honor their lifetime warranty, but I could pay for another lid and get it quickly.There are many other water bottles on the market that cost much less and are better quality. I do not reccomend Tervis products to anyone."
1,"Expensive, not worth the price!","I am not sure where others have used these tumblers. I have the small and large sizes, went for the straws and lids, handles, bought it all hook, line, and sinker (stinker) from their website reviews. I have found that they do not keep drinks hot or cold very long at room temperature with AC. I have filled with ice and taken to work for a few hours and it is water. The hot drinks stay hot for maybe a half hour. The only good think is that they don't sweat on your desk or table. But that is a high price to pay when you could just use a coaster. I don't see how they claim to use these in a trunk in Arizona with ice for a day nor in Alaska for 4 hours for a hot drink. I am in Pennsylvania indoors and they don't work for me. I am very sorry I purchased many of these for Christmas gifts last year, I will never do it again. I embarrassed I purchased such low quality gifts."
1,Save Your Money,"I wanted a travel tumbler that wouldn't leak and would go in the microwave so I tried the tumbler, handle and lid at a cost of about 33.00 for all three.The lid leaks just like the 2.00 to 5.00 ones I have. When I close the slider on the matching lid, it sprays liquid all over. The handle works fine while i'm holding the mug and falls off when I set it down.I won't be throwing any more money away on Tervis crap!"
5,Tervis Tumblers are the best,Amazing drinkware that does exactly what it says it will do! Insulates both cold and hot beverages and leaves no ring on your table. This bigger size holds plenty for a meal.
4,Kierkegaard for the Preacher,"Craddock puts the question quite right: ""How do we proclaim the gospel to people who have heard it all before--and have done so for years, and decades, and eons?!?!"" How might we phrase our remarks so that the gospel just might be overheard by those not intending to ""hear"" the gospel at all? But this is God's work and not ours--yet Craddock invites us, as the master preacher that he is to think about these matters carefully and to allow Kierkegaard to be our guide. Sometimes one doesn't need all the answers to questions answered, or even a paint by the dot book in order to reap the benefits--one just needs to hear the question articulated in order to stop and think about how brilliant the question really is...Craddock does that for us here--and we are in his debt."
5,Now we're talking!,"I am a professional conductor and have been a huge fan of Karajan for 40 years. This DVD should have been released 30 years ago! It would have made Karajan even more of a household name. Great documentary in every way. The best part is all of the never-before-seen footage that we all knew existed but for whatever reason took this long to release. Based on what we see here, there must be hundreds of hours of Karajan rehearsal footage just sitting in the vaults - PLEASE RELEASE THIS MATERIAL!!!!!!If you are at all interested in Karajan, purchase this film. Sure, not EVERYTHING is covered but it paints a wonderful picture of a historically important conductor. Great release DG. More please, much more.(I'll bet DG and Sony could release all of their Karajan DVD's with an extra companion disc of rehearsal footage of the works performed/recorded. People would love it!)Thanks so much."
2,TOO MUCH POP GARBAGE,"Whoever thought this album was worthy of a good hip-hop review should remove themselves from eminem's crotch. Eminem is not one of the greatest mcs of all time, anyone who thinks that has no grasp of hip-hop history and the pioneers who let eminem have this medium. This album is childish and poppy, has more singing than rapping, and more whining than singing. Blah Blah Blah go get some real hip-hop unless you just like pop."
2,not worth it,"Now I usually really like Eminem songs. Mockingbird kinda creeps me out to be honest. I mean he made it clear that he loves her in other songs, but there is just something not right there. It's getting really annoying hearing about her all the time. And Just Lose It and Like Toy Soldiers are the main reason why I bought this album. But there is only a few songs on this CD. Not worth your money. I mean radio stations are constantly playing these songs. If you listen to the radio a lot you'll get sick of them."
4,Slim I'd like to introduce you to Em!,"First off this album is to say the least, interesting. Right after I bought it I put it on my iPod and listened to each song rating them as I went. The album got 70 stars for the 16 songs giving it a 4.4.The album is basically Slim Shady talking about his personal issues (Marshall) and rapping like Em. The rhyme patterns are better than The Eminem Show and the sarcasm gets even funnier while he dives deeper into his past.I couldn't immediately decide whether I like it but I slept on it and am listening to it for the third time right now and I do love it. Em is the only artist to bring me out of the underground hip-hop scene."
2,"Pretty bad, really.","With the exception of 'Like Toy Soldiers', this album is basically crap. When will Eminem learn nobody wants to hear him sing on every single hook? 'Evil Deeds' wouldn't be terrible if he didn't have that annoying chorus. But he did, and it was terrible. 'Puke', 'My 1st Single', 'Ass Like That', 'Just Lose It', 'Big Weenie', 'Crazy In Love', and 'One Shot 2 Shot' all range from bad to worse. 'Ass Like That' is funny once, but it doesn't last long and it isn't even that funny. And don't get me started on 'Just Lose It'.Another problem is 'Mosh'. Too much anger rapped way too slow. It's supposed to sound like a speech, but it just doesn't work.The problems go on with this album. The lyrics are average at best, and the production will hold your interest for a few listens max. If you're a diehard Eminem fan, you'll probably enjoy this. If you were hoping Eminem would make a good album again, then better luck next time."
4,Should Have been 5 stars (instead of 4),"I surely hope this is not Em's last CD, cause he needs to come out with something alot better to be remembered last by. This CD is good and in my opinion worth buying, but I do consider this CD to be slightly below Em's usual skill level. It seems sometimes during the CD he is just rapping about anything that comes to mind, almost like he ran out of stuff to rap about. Most of the lyrics on this CD are alright or pretty good, but a few rhymes here and there are not. Most of the beats are pretty good or decent, there are a few bland ones. I like almost all the songs on this CD. But the best ones are ""Evil Deeds"", ""like toy soldiers"", ""Mosh"", ""Spend some time"", ""Mockingbird"", ""encore"", and ""Just Loose It"" I wanted to put ""ass like that"" was one of the best, but parts of it are kind of too silly, but most of it is good, which is kind of how the rest of the CD is. This CD is definitely worth buying though and I am glad I purchased it."
2,A Sad Encore,"I am a good fan of Eminem's work but with this album, Encore, he really lets people down. The beats are very good but only a couple songs stick out with good rhymes (in which most of the rhymes come from guest artists). It seems Eminem is really losing his edge with rap & should become more concerned with his production, since that is what is good from the album. In general if you are a real rap fan and like Eminem I would recommend NOT buying this album brand new, maybe buy it at a used price. This is the saddest encore I have ever seen an artist do. Eminem needs rhyming help!!!!"
1,Has-been...,"...or should I say never-was? Huh. Seems Feminem is going the way of Creed and ""da Bizzkut"". No more posing on every pre-pubescent magazine cover with that stupid-looking scowl... yup. He's done. This fad has passed. The 13-year-olds who once idolized him have moved on to something else. (It's nothing good, but it's something else.) It won't be long before this CD (along with the rest of his schlop) ends up in the 49 cent bin.I said it before, and I'll say it again: we need the next big thing in music to happen ASAP, to officially kill this crapola DEAD, like Nirvana did with hair metal and new wave did with disco. It's gotta be on its way..."
1,Very bad,Dont buy this cd.Its very bad.Eminem is finished for sure.I think all of you that buy this cd will regret.Bad lyrics and bad beats
2,EMO,"Eminem is emo. When people say emo, people get the idea of a bunch of little white fags who play crappy chords on a guitar and call it a song. You might also think about these types of people who [...] a lot.Well, if that is the case, Eminem formed a new genre of music: Emo Rap.Now we have emo rap. Don't believe me? Buy this CD and listen to a soft new Em who still [...]."
5,Different but classic,This album is a very good album. Em is clearly making the statement can't nobody touch him lyrically. I mean who can spit crazy rhymes in an arab tone like he does in Ass Like That. He touched on a lotta personal things in his life. I like every song on the album including the three bonus tracks. This ain't the Marshal Mathers LP 2 but it is damn good. The craziest song on this album is My 1st single because the stuff he says is just sick. It almost seems like he is rhyming non stop without taking any time to breathe. Crazy s@#$ Em. Hope its not the last album we get from him. We need another Encore to the Encore album.
2,Stop,"Man, this album makes me sad.Em, what's happenin?!?This album ain't the REAL SLIM SHADY.The beats ain't serious.I think Em & Dre are kidding.I remember bout ""Slim Shady LP"", ""Marshall Mathers LP"" and ""Eminem Show"".That was good music.But ""Encore"" sounds like a new producer tried 2 do his thing.Sorry.I respect Dre & Em. I have all albums of em.They're off tha heeezzyy.But this album is s*#$.The only song which is a lil bit Em, is ""Mockingbird"".It sounds like ""Hailie's Song"",which is a very good song.But the rest is...I think Em should stop that music thang.But Em I love ya music anyway.;-)PEACE"
2,Eminem,"How can Eminem make four good LP's? You can't top his last two albums Eminem show and Marshall Mathers, Plus He showed the softer side of him self in 8 mile the movie. I think he did an ok try on encore not his best but not so bad."
4,The EM Returns,With The Eminem Show he sold 19 million albums and won some awards. He released a soundtack and sold 9 million albums again winning awards. He had another plat album in D12 world and his underground stuff was specatacular. People were screaming for an ENCORE.That is exaclty what we got.The clues were there. He released yet another goofy song that was cloned from the other first singles hitting up Psycho Jacko for this round of disses. His second was a hate song ala white america\fight music. The title was the final clue. ENCORE.I dl'd this baby nov 3. I started listening. It started just like the the em show ended and then proceeded to put together a remix of the EM show.Personally I was surprised at the fan response to this. Most of the online reviews gave it each a another layer crap. What your not happy he gave in? Surprised it sounds like 50's first album. surprised it has
4,The Dummy is inspired,"I need help, and this book may be what I've been looking for. I need to eat better and move more and get fit and lose weight. But I can't afford 90 mins twice a week with a trainer and a personal chef. And there is sooooo much conflicting information about there for those of us who try to do it alone! This volume is consistent and helpful. I now understand that I'll do better if I nosh a little something before I go to the health club, and why it makes sense to stretch for a moment before stepping onto the treadmill. While I realize that this book may not prepare me for the cover of the 2012 SI Swimsuit issue, I'm confident it will help me make little improvements that will pay valuable dividends."
3,Interesting,This book has a lot information in it but I only needed it for class. It was interesting to read.
3,Thorough and straightforward.,"I like the fact that the book took me back to the basics of fitness and health.This was a good awakening, especially now that i'm dealing with some beginner exercisers.It heightened my sensitivity.I like the book for its straightforwardness, the authors are honest and I was impressed by this.I've had other dummies books, and this one hasn't failed in delivering the information."
2,Mixes anti-male mesage with workouts,"Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent have got to be femi-nazis. I don't normally expect to find insluting male-bashing messages in exercise books but this one had them. Consider the following from the first edition ""Praise for Dummies"" on page 3:""When it comes to fitness, like most male American slugs, I'm more of a complete blathering moronic idiot.""Several male-bashing cartoons as well.My advice is skip this book and the authors."
3,Dummies 3 - Idiots 4 (First Half),"I need one intro book on exercising and was juggling the ""Dummies"" and the ""Idiots"". I liked the organization and the clean layout of the Dummies book, but ultimately decided to go with the Idiots.The main deal breaker was Martial Arts. The Dummies have no coverage at all (except Tai Chi, which doesn't really count), while the Idiots have a whole chapter. There is also some coverage of other ""artistic"" aerobic activities like dance. This is very important for me as I personally see the traditional machine-based workouts as too soulless.The Amazon editorial for Idiots points out the other discrepancy - lack of coverage about injuries. Amazon does not provide sample pages for Idiots, so I couldn't verify just how much it is covered. But it's definitely missing from the Dummies."
3,Too basic,"I did not learn much from this book. A lot of it is advice on what to do inside a health club, and since I've been a member of one, a lot of it was old news. I was looking for something more than simple ""do not smoke, keep your heart rate up"", advice, I did not find it here."
1,"Awful ""movie"" with bad lip sync","This is not a typical opera performed on stage, but a ""movie"" where actors pretend singing on a lot more realistic settings, with real water, miniature ship, and so on.In the beginning, I thought it was a good idea.... but as soon as singing started, oh man....The singers hardly move their lips! So fake! and the songs are cut to make this DVD to fit in a single disc!I cannot believe anyone recommends this production!!!"
4,Wished it were longer.,"Margaret Lark no longer worked in the corporate world. She had been torn between her employer and lover only a year ago. Now the lover, Rafe is back. He was ruthless in the corporate world and their relationship came second. But he has changed since he lost Maggie. Maggie comes first this time and he is determined to win her back.Rafe lured Maggie out to his ranch by informing her that her father is getting married to his mother. Now she is on his turf and the battle of wills has begun.***So good I wished it were longer. Highly recommended.***"
5,A Real Relationship for once.,This was my first Jayne Krentz book and I loved it. It was great to have a book about people in a real relationship who had some real problems. Rafe's determination to win Maggie back was charming and refreshing. It was nice to see two characters having heart to heart talks about their problems as well as some steamy romance.
3,Hero is not a cowboy!,"As a Texas native who now lives in Oklahoma, I have seen my share of cowboys. I know this may seem picky, but I couldn't get past the fact that Rafe was constantly described as wearing boots with flower or star patterns. Note to Ms. Krentz: No self respecting cowboy would allow himself to wear such prissy clothing! Other than this obvious faux pas, the story seemed pretty much like the standard Krentz romance. Arrogant man bent on revenge meets feisty heroine who convinces him revenge is not the answer. I sometimes think Ms. Krentz's characters are interchangeable. On the plus side, this is a light, breezy romance perfect for an easy read. If you aren't expecting an original plot and you can stomach a cowboy with purple flowers on his boots, then this is the book for you."
4,NOT PARTICULARLY THE BEST - CHARACTERS?,"I must say that Margaret Lark has nothing to recommend herself for a strong female character.She is ready to hop back into bed with Rafe Cassidy even though she does not trust him. What a bummer!Rafe Cassidy is the typical alpha male, arrogant, determined to have his way - but he learns to bend.He appears gracious in his emotional growth - but Maggie?This is not the best of the trilogy but is an easy read - has a bit of growth to the plot but why is it always assumed that love grows out of PMS [premarital sex]?Yup! she was still his mistress - what a come down for the modern woman - no guts to say no.Where is the strength of character not to give into temptation?Just weak, wishy-washy females.Revenge seems to motivate many people and injects a bit of tension with something to back down from - at their ages they should be more mature.Still a readable story as part of the trilogy."
2,Pass me the saucepan - arrogant hero alert!,"I don't like alpha males, donkey kings, or whatever you call very very very stubborn and arrogant heroes. Some authors write them well, others don't. I guess in 1990 Ms Krentz is still polishing up her act because the guy in this book is very very annoying.Worse, the heroine is one of those women who insists she will do as she please while following the hero's orders. Irritating. After a while all I wanted to do is to close the book and imagine forcing those two to watch Barney until they plead mercy.Of all three of the Legends and Ladies trilogy, the best (to me) is the Pirate, even that one is only a three-star book. At such a steep price, I'd recommend saving for ""Flash"". At least that one is new."
1,This is a reissue of a 1990 book.,The Copyright on this book is 1990. It is a shame that book publishers try to fool readers by saying this is a new book. The book is one of a series that is not up to her usual standard. I hope her new one soon to be published is better.
3,Title apropos,"Apropos title in that as we read the accounts of a troubled young woman's experiences into a psychotic hell, it does make the reader shudder.Angela is an ""ordinary"" young woman who is single, lonely, and working at a daycare center with kids, whom she loves. ""Dominique"" was abused as a child, her parents believing that ""ordinary"" people are not worth living, and young children can and should be abused. Detective Robert Card first experiences the workings of Dominique when he is called to the kidnapping and murder of Jamie Frisch. Partner Ellen Lindstrom smells a fish and decides to follow Angela. In therapy, Angela begins to unravel the mystery of her past, and her psychoses. Detective Card's son, 7 year old Mike, becomes the pawn in a deadly game. The good girl, Angela, puts up a good fight against her alter-ego."
1,It Seemed Great,"Main reason for purchase was a can't beat price. It was pefect size and weight. Purchased new for 79.99 June 2003. December 24, 2003, I pressed the power button, and got nothing. Took in to Magnavox authorized repair agent, and they wanted $20 off the top just to tell me what was wrong. Felt I was being taken, so will bite the bullet and purchase another brand."
3,"Fun, but save for summer",This is actually a really fun product. I think that I will save it for summer and I don't think that I'm going to purchase again. My skin is a bit too dry and sensitive for this kind of face mask. It does tend to dry the skin out so if you have oily skin this would be great.
1,directions are in Japanese,"If I could just find out how long to put it on the face, how often per week etc. Everything is in Japanese, and the little label that is stuck over in English language for instructions, is so small, I can't even make out what's up with reading glasses. And I don't really have usually problems with my eye sight when it comes to reading as I am narrow sighted."
4,Alex Picnic Basket,"I had looked all over for a pcinic basket for my 3 yr old granddaughter. She loves to pretend she is having a ""picnic"" The Alex PicnicBasket is the very best one I found. It is just the right size and contains all she needs - even a play ""blanket"". And best of all when she's done playing it all goes back into the basket for easy storage. Great price, great toy!"
4,Picnic set,"My five year old granddaughter thoroughly enjoys this set and includes us in her ""picnics"". I wish that it were not made in China after all the publicity about toys coming from China with lead in them. I only hope and pray that this is not one of them. I have faith in Amazon that they will check items before they are posted. Otherwise, it is a cute little toy for the price."
3,"OK, but van Kampen is better","""Handbook"" is a fitting title. It reads more like a collection of solution techniques than like a book meant to actually teach the subject to someone, which is perfectly acceptable for a reference book but not really suitable for a textbook.Unfortunately for this book, however, van Kampen's book is better as both a reference and a textbook. While generally written with a somewhat higher degree of sophistication, van Kampen is organized so much more logically and is so much more complete in its development of the subject that it is far easier to read, even as (or maybe especially as?) an introductory book.Gardiner is a good book, and there are things that it has over van Kampen: a chapter on approximation methods, a chapter on simulation methods, and a little bit more detail on certain topics. However, van Kampen's is a phenomenal book and really should be chosen over this one except by those readers with very specific needs."
1,Hard to follow book.,"This book might be mathematically sound, but it is extremely hard to follow. The contents are in no way elementary, yet the author doesn't use the customary procedure of naming theorems, proofs and examples. As a result, the entire exposition is confusing and you have a consistent feeling of being lost among ""easy"", ""elementary"", ""obvious"" and ""trivial"" things.Furthermore, the author completely fails on hinting any way of applying the mathematical results he boringly describe. No figures, no algorithms, no well fleshed out examples that the reader who has not been following the subject in the last one hundred years can easily understand. So, there is no way you can consider this an introductory book, but because the poor structure is also swampy as a handbook or reference.What can I say good about the book? Well, the choices in this subject are rather scarce and the author is having a good time by being the only one in the market."
2,Doesn't hold up well,"My waffle iron is now 13 months old, but we wanted to replace it after only 6 months. The non-stick coating has never been entirely non-stick, which has been frustrating, but worse still is that in its most recent use huge flakes of it came off with every waffle baked. The flakes didn't bake into the batter, they peeled away from the iron when the waffle is released. The unreliably non-stick coating is nearly gone and despite how well it heats and bakes, now that every waffle sticks tightly to the top surface, the unit is going too: into the trash. What a waste."
4,Old time waffles,"This is a fine machine for the price. If you, like me, want non-Belgium waffles, this is the way to go. It is simple to use and store. Has warning lights and beeper to tell you when waffles are ready and when they are cooking. A dial to select how well done you would like your waffles.Before purchasing this one I had a new Black and Decker iron (same price) but the thing would cook the bottom of the waffles more than the top. And you could see the 'mark' of the heating coil on the waffles since that is primarily where it cooked them.All in all this machine gives great value for the price.Yummm."
4,Great Waffles,We bought this as a gift to our daughter's family and were able to use it on a visit there. I like it's performance and styling very much. It's so nice to have freshly baked waffles and it does this quite evenly and relatively quickly with little sticking.We liked it enough to order one for ourselves and were very disappointed that they REFUSE TO SHIP TO OUR ADDRESS IN HAWAII.
3,Cuisinart WAF-R Traditional Waffle Iron,"For many, many years, we had a Sunbeam traditional waffle iron with adjustable browning. We loved it. It finally quit. We went out and bought a Belgian waffle maker. Hated it. Gave it to the Salvation Army. Tried another brand of Belgian waffle maker. Didn't like that either. Gave it to the church. Realized we didn't like the ""Belgian"" waffle style but could not find a traditional waffle maker in the local stores. Finally found the Cuisinart Traditional waffle maker on line. It took a little getting used to but makes very good ""traditional"" waffles. Not as good as our old Sunbeam but acceptable."
5,Simply The Best,"This waffle maker is so nice. The waffles come out crisp and fluffy and perfect every time. Don't listen to the people who say bad things about it. They probably never read the manual (which is very helpful by the way). It contains all kinds of recipes I never would have thought of. Also, I have never spilled a drip or had it run over as others have stated. Just use a heaping 1/3 cup and your waffles will come out nice and round without spilling. This is a well made high quality product that should last quite awhile."
4,Okay but with reservations,"I purchased this waffle iron because my husband wanted regular old fashioned waffles. This waffle iron does cook homemade waffles well - the bell to let you know that they are done is terrific. However, I don't know how much 'abuse' this waffle maker will take. The hinge connecting it is 'wiggly' and I'm very careful handling the iron. But other than this waffle iron, there aren't any available anywhere except belgium waffle makers (which for some strange reason he doesn't like). So yes I am happy with it but I handle it carefully! But if you want a 'regular' waffle iron - go with this one."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,I ordered the product. Was supposed to ship in about a week. Charged for the product. then a 4-5 days later told it was out of stock - merchandiser error. I never got the product. Received credit back to my account.
2,Looks good but has some issues,"Have been using this waffle maker for three years. Some things to consider, the first waffle is almost always over done, the following waffles will be under done unless you re heat one cycle between waffles this takes too much time for a hungry family. Off an on the waffles have really stuck no matter how good the seasoning is. If you overflow the waffle the sides are very hard to clean little cracks and crevices fill up with waffle batter. And finally the major issue is that the non stick coating is flaking off. This one is going in the trash, just hope can find a better waffle maker. They just don't make them like they used too."
5,Having Fun!,"I have always loved waffles especially homemade. This waffle iron surpasses all of my expectations. The reviews I found on Amazon were all true, especially about it getting very hot (be very careful). I highly recommend this iron."
1,customer service??????,"My Wife bought one of these waffle makers and read and followed ALL of the instructions. The second time she used it, the lifting handle broke off in her hand while attempting to produce the first waffle. We have sent two emails to customer service which included a photo of the damaged waffle maker. To date, NEITHER of the two emails has received an acknowledgment or a reply."
4,just like waffle house,"O.K., I admit I bought this because of the way it looks. Reminds me of the commercial ones at the restaurants. However looks don't make up for a waffle that is cooked well on the bottom, but uncooked on top. I tried it several times but the top element doesn't heat. Lesson learned and the dumpster got a new waffle iron.Once I calmed down I thought ""If I'm going to throw it out anyway, why not open it up first."" Easier said than done with hidden screws under glued in bits of plastic, but got the lid off and saw the stake-on for the neutral was off. Heats up now, but I haven't made any waffles yet.They still get one star for lack of ""Quality Control"".Not that it matters as this product is no longer available but it actually works great! As you can see I amended my rating because it has worked great for years now."
4,"Had it a year, and I love it","We have had this waffle iron a year and it works great. I follow directions about spraying it with cooking spray before I begin and I've never had a problem with batter sticking to the irons. It seems it always oozes out over the sides for me at least once per use, but it's no big deal to clean. The beep is fine, not annoying, and I really depend on it. The hinge and the locking mechanism have always worked for me. I've never burned myself on it, but I guess I see how that might happen if you are not careful. I've used some of the recipes it came with and they were good not great. Skip the brownie waffle, yuk. I like the waffle recipes from Alton Brown and the Best Recipe."
3,"Good Waffles, yes- but Cheap Construction","I had been in the market for a new waffle iron and thought Cuisinart would be the way to go- so I placed my order. When it arrived, however, I noticed that it did not match the one on the box- or on the page supplied to Amazon. See, there is a cheap, plastic band that runs along the bottom edge. It looks very tacky and catches any spill overs that occur when hurrying to make Sunday breakfast. The batter is really difficult to clean from this area and unless one has hired help or the time to sit with a thin blade and remove it, consider it a permanent part of the waffle iron.I know, I could have returned it but I dropped the ball and never did. It does make great waffles after all! I recommend Calphalon, a much more sturdy design with little if any plastic. If there's a next time, Cuisinart will not be on my list."
2,good price but one of the cartridges leaked,The price is better than most retailers and it is getting harder and harder to find the #14 cartridges for our printer so we are somewhat stuck in selection but the recent shipment actually leaked.
2,Is it over Yet?,"I first must admit I'm not a big fan of racing games, but I try to keep an open mind and decided to rent Rallisport Challenge for a long weekend. I found this game tedious at best. I thought the cars were very difficult to control using the standard X-box controller and felt very unnatural. Despite hours of practice and employing several different driving strategies, I consistently got badly outraced, even on the simplest of courses.I must admit, the graphics, music, and car options were intriguing and kept me playing this game for awhile. But these ""sugar-coated"" features can't really hide the fact that the game is a dud, and definately not worth purchasing."
4,Must have for the racing fan,"While not a perfect game the gameplay in Rallisport challenge is far and away the best available on any game system now for pure racing.This game challenges you on dozens of tracks throughout the life of the game which eliminates any chances you have of mastering them all. Consequently, the replay value of this game is very high.Additionally, this game, unlike many others, doesn't reward you for the sake of rewarding you. You actually have to earn all of the rewards, whether extra cars (a lot of them) or extra tracks (also a lot of them).The only things that hold this game back from being a 5 are the lack of customization you can do to the cars and the music which plays in a seemingly endless short loop. Mercifully you can burn your own with the Xbox."
5,Awesome Rally racer with great controll!,This game is flat-out fun!The ice racing is a blast and the graphics are super. Blasting around a dirt track grinding the gears in my tricked-out Ford focus rocks.
4,This game ROCKS!,"I'm currently renting this game and it is a lot of fun. There are a whole lot of tracks to race on and a lot of cars to choose from. It does tend to get a little boring after a couple of hours in the career mode; however, it is a good game to buy because you'll always have a good itch to play a rad racing game. I plan on purchasing this game for my quiver of games."
2,Not Realistic,"Some of the problems I have with this game are: 1)Tracks are too easy, not challenging. 2)You don't make up time on the turns. 3) If you floor it all throughout the race, your not penalized, finesse is not rewarded, and the damage on the car doesn't affect your speed. 4) Tracks are generic, and not specific to a certain country. 5)Feedback is gimmicky.This is a game for a younger audience under 10 years of age. For a more realistic Xbox game, I recommend Colin McRae Rally 3 and if your willing to wait for November of 2003, Colin McRae Rally 04 will be coming out."
3,Fun with Friends,"I got this game as a gift from someone who is very into racing. He was a drag racer before he retired. The game is pretty challenging, but I am more of an FPS/MMORPG fan, so I do not play many racing games. If you are like me, you'll derive the most fun from this game while playing with friends. It allows you to play songs from your XBox Library in the car, which is a cool feature. Obviously this review is coming out way too late, but anyone looking for a cheap racing game to play with friends, I would recommend this. It doesn't have the rigidity of NASCAR games, and it doesn't have the sprawling environments and chaotic city tracks like some of the Le Mans games."
4,Best racing game for Xbox,"I tried PGR, and returned it. It was fun, but Rallisport is so much fun to play because of drifting.I mean, what is better... driving through cities, or driving through mountains, deserts, jungles, etc.? The graphics are the best I have ever seen. So good, they are a distraction sometimes.Definitely recommend it to get.Only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because in multiplayer, you cannot know what types of turns are coming up b/c there is no map, or turn signals... a person knowing the course would absolutely demolish everyone else."
2,a bit to diffucult in later stages of career mode (beginner),"The game is great looking but what's up with the diffuculty level in the later stages of career mode. I don't know about anyone else but I don't care to spend a full day trying to learn each turn of one certain track so I can come some what close to finshing 2nd or 3rd. The faster cars that you open up are no fun to race with they go to fast for the later races and all you do is spin out at every turn, they are to hard to keep on the narrow tracks. This game is worth a rental, after a week or so it's just not any fun you'll find your self getting very angy (I try to avoid these kind a games). I believe a game should be a journey you would not normally experience in life and enjoy doing it not hating it, especially at the prices these games are now a days."
4,Xbox Scored major points with this!!,"First of all, I dont own Xbox, i own a PS2, but I was impressed big time with RalliSport Challenge. The car physics are remarkably realistic with spin-outs, powerslides, jumps, car damage e.t.c. A plethora of racetracks on different terrain which are accurate and a good selection of licensed rally cars are available.(Subaru WRC impreza's my fave).The game's AI is sufficiently difficult for a challenge, and u can't afford to take your eye off the track for a sec. I'm a racing game nut, but you don't have to be to enjoy this title. The selection screen is easy to navigate, so for those impatient one's, you can jump right in. I'm at my cousins house every weekend to play this title...considering i hate Xbox and it's owners ;-). This is a must have. Two Thumbs Up."
5,The Victims Speak,"I purchased this book as part of my collection in order to do research for my novelChernobyl Murders. The book turned out to be more than research. It is a moving account from people who were actually there. Svetlana's interviews, in which she simply allows the victims to tell their stories, are marvelous. I know nuclear power is being promoted again. However, I used to work in the nuclear energy field and there is still much to consider, especially when you go inside any power plant and look at the spent fuel rods simply submerged in pools of water."
5,The other side of Chernobyl,"This book tells the story of people of lived through consequences of the disaster. Consequences that people generally not talk about. It is the other side from the the disaster. The book is not about technical facts but describes the worries and fears of the victims. Victims who had to leave, victims who lost loved ones etc.Highly recommended to get more feeling with the impact of the Chernobyl disaster that was not in the media a lot."
2,Disappointing,I didn't except great sound due to the age of some of the original recordings but...the quality is often comparable to what you hear on the discounted CDs available at the quick service gas stop.Too bad...Jackson really is the Queen of Gospel and had an incredibly powerful sound. One would never know that from hearing this.
5,A Legendary Singer a Great Reflective Album,"Mahalia Jackson, what a singer, what a heart, what a soulful woman. This is a good collection of Mahalia's music."
4,"Excellent music, bad acting.","This movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys Cab Calloway and/or his music. Cab's music more than makes up for what is lacking from the actors/actresses. It is in it's original form and is only an hour long, so the music recordings are rather rustic. I highly recommend this film."
5,The very talented Mr. Cab Calloway.,"This is a must see film, if you like Cab Calloway's music. The actors and actresses were a little stiff when it came to moving,but maybe they were a little nervous. The scene of the ganster slapping down Minnie was priceless. That poor girl, was always on the floor. Cab's rendition of a bumb, and acting as if he were drunk while dancing and singing St. James infirmery, was a hoot. you would have to see it for yourself, I recommend this film for your classic video collection. P.S, the tap dancing trio were great!!."
2,don't bother...,Lasted six months...then started shredding apart. Get yourself a good vinyl or leather cover...you'll be glad you did! Waste of money...
5,Very poignant in today's world of rapid development,Extremely good prose. A poignant testimony to the loss of the Earth's resources in the face of historical and current development. Highly recommend adding this to your book collection if you have any affinity to the natural world.
2,Underwhelmed by the ( XXXXXXXX ). Needs more features,"I have to disagree with some of the reviews here so far. For $9000 I was expecting quite a bit more from this upgrade. Ever since ( XXXX ) Adobe has been a little slacking in the features department. Sure, it runs quite a bit faster and picks my wardrobe a little bit faster, but where's the groundbreaking feature set that Adobe has been promising? until adobe adds the DNA sequencing filter and refrigerated keg layer, I'm going to say hold off if you can."
1,They ruined it,"Adobe had a really good thing with XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ( XXXXXXX ). I don't know why they decided to change the product and call it Adobe Font Folio OT 1.0 20-user Lic. The last version gave us so much for our X, and now this is just merde. I wouldn't pay 2 cents for this."
2,for serious birders only,"This book isn't much fun. It's not much of a book either. The whole thing is a list of birds the author saw and musings on the lousy food he ate. The narrative doesn't flow well. One minute the author is a boy mowing the grass the next minute he's an astronomer and then a few chapters later he has a family. When he mentions the family I thought wait a minute, he just graduated and got a job, didn't he?I had to force myself to finish it."
5,nice hose,"Hoses this length are not available locally in the wintertime. We have been using it for weeks now without any issues. Great hose, especially for the price. Will buy again when I need another one."
1,I would rather burn my money than use it to buy this printer,"I bought this printer because i wasn't looking for extremely high quality, i just wanted something to print out the occasional color print and mostly black ink spreadsheets and documents. it turns out that when one color ink runs out, YOU CAN'T EVEN PRINT IN BLACK INK ONLY!!!!!! Why should i have to spend money on color ink i am not going to use just so i can print stuff in black ink??????????"
1,"Awesome prints, only lasts over a year","Had this printer for little over a year. Bought this printer because had reliable epson printers in the past. Print head were clogged and had to use very imaginable methods to unclog them, and had just installed brand new cartridge. After I got the heads unclogged I had cleaned the print heads about 5 times and it said my black (brand new) cartridge was out of ink. Obviously it was not because it was clogged to begin with. Epson uses chips on the back of the printer cartridges that will measure how many times the print heads fire and keeps track of this on the chip. The chip decided I had printed too much (even though I had printed nothing) and printer refused to let me print anything because of the cartridge being empty. Now do I spend another 27 bucks on a black cartridge and take my chances or buy a new printer. Ive decided to go with the Canon PIXMA MP500 All-In-One Photo Printer. Canon has a good track record and low costing ink."
1,Can anyone recommend a decent printer? - I can't ...,"I can't remember what it was that made me buy my Epson Stylus C84 just over a year ago from PC World, but it probably was the price. I know that I avoided the Canon model because of the expensive cartridges but EPSON have been able to squeeze plenty of money out of me since as I have been desperately trying to get this printer to work. Cleaning the Heads seems to be required now every time I want to print so I guess that the ink jet nozzles are too narrow or something... Whatever is wrong with them it is a REAL PAIN. I have just put in a brand new set of cartridges and although the Black shows it is Full, there's a problem with the others as they a showing only one third full....So, if anyone can recommend a decent printer, please let me know. I have money, but I don't want to make another mistake like buying this Epson Stylus.Pity I can't award ZERO stars for this product!"
1,This printer was made to eat ink!,"We initially bought this printer at amazon in 2003 for $150. Then, after a year or so, no matter how many new ink cartridges we inserted, the print quality was always poor. I called Epson, and to their credit, they replaced our printer (we were 14 days out of warranty at that point). Currently, our new replacement printer has 4 new ink cartridges (a $90 retail value!) and only the black works. It seems that the first run of cartridges work GREAT then when you start replacing them you have to clean the heads over and over again... until, surprise, you use up all the expensive ink and the things you print still look horrid. Also, it will tell you are out of ink and you'll take the cartridge out, shake it and be irritated when you hear lots and lots of liquid squishing around inside. It's not like the HP cartridges of days gone by where you can shake it and get that last drop of ink out. If the printer thinks it's empty, that's it, throw it out. Very wasteful :("
2,Plugged print heads... what a waste,"This printer worked like a charm until the warranty ran out. Then the black ink head plugged, wouldnt clean no matter how hard I tried. Epson want $9.95 to talk to me. I did get online email support, and they told me its messed up and I can pay them to repair it.Its cheaper to buy a new printer! Now Im stuck with two new black ink cartridges I installed (thinking one must have been defective) that puts me out another $50.Forget Epson. Stay away from the C84. It was good while it lasted albeit a short time. Just not worth the trouble."
1,Losing Faith in Epson,"I received this printer as part of a package deal when buying my laptop in 2003. I previously owned an epson 740 which I had very little problems with and used to print my entire graphic design portfolio. Up until owning this printer I was a diehard Epson fan. Nevermore quote the graphic designer. I have to agree with all the other reviews on here. It sucks ink like kool-aid, claims cartridges are empty when they still have ink left and the print heads consistently clog. I just spent $78 replacing ink cartridges only to find out that it still won't print a single thing despite having had a dozen or more cleanings. Not sure what Epson's deal is but the quality of their products just keeps getting worse and worse!"
2,Great while it lasted...but not for very long,"This printer went on the fritz exactly one week after the warranty expired! I see from the review below that this has happened to other customers as well. We were very pleased with the printer while it was working, although it does eat up ink cartridges quickly. After one year of mild use (printing once a week or so) now it doesn't print any black ink. It would probably cost more to fix the printer than it did to buy it, so I think it's time to look for a new printer, and I don't think I'll be buying an Epson next time!"
1,Epson C84 is a rip-off,"I purchased my Epson C84 because of of the advertised longivity of it's inks and because I've generally been pleased with Epson products.I should have done my research before purchasing, however. While the printer only cost me $75 dollars, the replacement inks cost almost the same. For some reason, it appears that the inks run out about the same time, which would seem to counter the claims that separate inks save money.And, upon inspection, I noticed two dotted lines running down both the long sides of my print.When I e-mailed Epson, the explaination was of no use. When I finally ran out of ink, I packed it away."
1,Not a good deal,"I purchased this printer, and the ink QUICKLY ran out. Upon trying to replace it, couldnt get the ink to work in it. So I got one round of printing from this printer. Not a good deal."
3,"Great, when it actually prints","When this printer actually decides to work, it works great. It takes a longer-than average time to think, send the ink back and forth and get itself all adjusted before it starts printing the job. Once it finally gets going, it is quick and clear. The most annoying thing about this printer is that if ANY of the ink cartridges run out, it refuses to print anything, even if you tell it to print in black-only mode (when for example the yellow has run out). The HP inkjet printers I've used don't do this.It does seem like the ink doesn't dry up as quickly as HP inkjet cartridges, but maybe I just can't tell the difference between dry vs. empty Epson cartridges.Lastly, one quick tip: If you get strange blurred or double-image print, make sure your paper input tray is full. This printer has this little quirk when the paper level is down at just a few sheets."
4,"Great Printer for the money spent,","I bought this printer almost a year ago, it seemed great until now. When used properly it prints amazing photos on the Epson premium glossy photo paper. No one could tell I printed the images, everyone thought they were developed. Recently the photos became bad with line spaces. May be it is the generic print cartridges that might be ruining it don't know. After clearing the heads still get horizontal line spaces. Or it is running low on ink. Seems to be a pretty good printer for all other printing documents, no lines there(after one year)."
5,Great Printer other than the easily fixable driver glitch,"This printer seems to be great and prints a wonderful photo. I bought it to replace my very old Stylus 850 in my office. It is pretty quiet and prints fast. I do a decent amount of daily printing and it seems to keep up fine. The only problem I had was when I installed it on Windows 98, I kept getting an error and it wasn't acknowledging the printer was there. I removed my old stylus driver and status monitor and it fixed the problem and worked immediately after restarting my computer. So if you have any problems after installing the driver, and you have an old epson driver or status monitor, I suggest that you remove them and restart your computer and then check to see if it is working. I also installed another one on a computer with Windows XP. Just to be safe prior to installation, I removed my old Epson driver and status monitor and had no problem at all.I highly recommend the printer for office or personal use."
1,Rip Off - Never Buying Epson Again!,"I just spent $60 on the pack of color and black ink. When I went to replace the ""empty"" cyan cartridge I shook it and there was still a lot of ink in there. I don't know how Epson can get away with this. I will buy a new printer when these inks run out and am never buying Epson again!"
4,Guess I'm the exception which proves the rule?,"C84 purchased in June 2004 and to date, works fine...never has clogged or failed to print...caveats: I do not buy Epson ink...neither do I print photos."
1,Sailed Epson for years but it's time to jump ship,"Being an educational institution we just can't afford to deal with the multitude of problems that the Epson C-82,C-84 suffer from. We purchase as many as 100 of these printers a year but the failure rate will certainly influence our purchase decision next budget cycle."
1,Riiiiiiiip Off,"I work at a college. After spring break 5, count them FIVE Epson stylus printers in five different offices stopped working....frozen ink problem. Die, Epson."
1,You will be disappointed...I guarantee it,"I should've listened to the others...I rarely use this printer (probably print a total of 10 pages per month--text documents),and then, out of the blue, a little over a year after I purchased it, the printer began printing blank pages. I tried everything that Epson suggests on their Troubleshooting guide: I cleaned the heads, I checked the nozzles, I put in brand new Epson cartridges. Still blank pages. If you're in the market for a printer, I'd spend a little more and get a quality (i.e. HP) printer. This is a lousy, flawed product. CAVEAT EMPTOR."
1,Seemed okay but not so!,I had gotten this as a freebie when I bought my Mac computer. I used it maybe twice because I prefer HP. Well I had a project come up that I NEEDED to use it because of how it sheet feeds the paper from the top. When I did use it; it seemed to work pretty good- I was surprised.Then I hadn't used it for maybe 4-5 months and now it is not printing at all. I went though all the diagnostics such as print head cleaning etc and NOTHING! Seems when I started looking all over the Internet for answers what I kept finding is that so many others have experienced the same thing.This is CRAZY as I have only printed under 20 pages total on this printer.Seems these printers are a waste of money. I do not recommened this printer.
1,if it would last just a bit longer - it would be awesome,"Just as everybody else, I experienced a great printer with wonderful durabrite inks, just to find myself stranded with yet another disposable printer. And also like everybody else, I dished out a lot of money for new cartridges (2 sets at $60) - to find that no new cartridge can remedy what is ailing this printer and off to the garbage it goes.I had 3 great Epson printers and then I had 3 disposable ones and I am absolutely done with Epson and can only hope for a class action suit, since the obvious design flaw should have had this company react with a recall, trade-in option or at least inform the consumers. Making so much money on inks that have to accompany this printer to the landfill shows this company has ethics I cannot and will not support. Great inks at this price are a ridiculous trade off. Canon, here I come."
1,Worst Printer Ever,"I have been a loyal Epson user (origial Stylus Color, Photo EX, 880, c80, c84) and always recommended them to my friends. Many of the ones I originally recommended were c84's. Boy do I feel bad now though. Of the people that bought them, 95% have failed with bad print heads. No amount of cleaning, new ink or anything else revives them.I have now moved to the Canon camp and will not buy another Epson ever again."
1,Excellent printer...........FOR A YEAR AND A HALF ONLY!!!,"This was an excellent printer, until I had to change all four cartridges at once for the second time. After I changed them, NOTHING would print. Not even when I ran several head cleanings! Every page was blank. The system told me that I was almost out ink. Well, HOW COULD I BE ALMOST OUT OF INK WHEN NOTHING PRINTED?!?!? Even uninstalling and reinstalling software didn't help. I didn't even see any leaks! For the price of those cartridges, I could have gotten a new printer. From this day forward, I will avoid buying another Epson printer."
5,Great Printer!,"This printer produces very high quality photos, as well color documents. Easy to download and install software gives increased flexiblity for photos and documents. This is a great printer for all of your printing needs. I highly recommend this printer."
1,Not a good deal,"Don't be fooled by the price... this printer has given me nothing but fits. I'm an MCSE, so I'm used to dealing with software problems, but I've never encountered an ink jet printer this unreliable. Paper feed doesn't work 1/2 the time, and once it *thinks* the cartridges are out of ink, good luck on printing anything.Aside from that, take a look at the cartridge prices (if you can find them). $35 for a black, $13 for each of the 3 colors. R-I-P O-F-F. We don't print very often (maybe a couple pages twice a month), and we ran out of ink in 6 months. The only photo printing we did was 3 4x6 prints on the trial paper that came with the printer. I had an HP 855C for close to a decade, and I remember changing the ink maybe 3 times.I strongly urge you to find something else. Do not waste your time or money on this product."
2,Same problem as the others...,"Yeah,,this seems like a great printer until it jsut stops printing and you buy new cartridges thinking that your surrent ones are out. Nope, the printer jsut stops working and is dead. Never buy and Epson again."
3,Glossy Photos,I haven't been able to get the glossy photo result when I print my photos. My HP works better at producing quality glossy photo finishes. All my photos with this Epson C84 look matted on the final product even though I use the Primium gloss Epson Photo paper and have the settings set at what I am supposed to. I am still talking to Epson and Best Buy to see if this is what I paid for.Still for the price and how you use it could still be a bargin.
1,Epson C84 Wastes Incredible Amounts of Ink,"I had some problems with my Epson C84, only printing in black, lots of banding. After opening it up to try to clean the print head I watched in amazement as it did its little inkjet dance before actually printing something. At the right hand side of the track this printer has a little vacuum pump that clears the print head - but you should see how much ink it pumps to waste in the process! This happens for every print job. Not only that, but at the left hand side of the track there is a well into which - you guessed it - the machine sprays more ink into to go to waste. No wonder the C84 seems to drink ink in huge quantities. Most of that expensive ink never even gets to paper - it ends up in a little sponge lined tray in the bottom of the machine.I have learned an important lesson buying this printer. Epson seems to have programmed the machine to waste as much ink as possible. Please do yourself a favor if you're considering buying an Epson - don't."
1,POS - not Point of Sale.,Owned 2 of these. Garbage. And if you pay the $275 the last buyer I saw had this listed for you must be on Crack. My $.02.
1,"Absolute piece of junk., junk, JUNK.! DON'T BUY Epson","I paid probably $50 for my Epson C84 printer and used it MAYBE 3 months with light print jobs. I ran out of ink. Replaced the ink. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price because now the heads are clogged (after repeated head cleanings and running through the ink even faster), and I'm still getting blank pages. I'll be doing my homework and checking reviews thoroughy before I buy my next printer. But I'll NEVER buy anything from Epson again. I've read the reviews here and it appears just about everyone has experienced the same problems. I don't know if anyone from Epson reads these reviews, but they need a reality check. Lose customers, lose your business, period. This printer is a pure piece of trash. Congratulations Epson, you've made yourself into an incompetant manufaturer. Never again!"
1,JUNK!!!! - Too bad there is no option for zero stars,"Same story as many of the other reviewers. I am a graphics professional, I know how to care for my printers. Thankfully, we received this printer for free with the purchase of a Mac powerbook. It's been a year-and-a-half, maybe two years... now the print heads are clogged and won't be cleaned. Avoid this printer unless you're into buying a new one every 18-24 months.Sure, the quality is good while it lasts. IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG."
2,What a piece of Junk,"It's a decent little printer. When it prints. Which isn't often. I find it crazy that the printer tells me when it's out of ink. I think I can do a pretty good job of figuring out that myself. And when it says it's out of ink, it won't print anything, even with the other colors it's not out of. Not even when it's not really out of the color it says it is. There's only one reason for this: it's a scam. Epson wants you to run out and buy more and more of their over-priced ink. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this printer."
1,"Epson C84 completely clogged, won't print anything","This printer quit printing (all colors) after a period of disuse, indicating low cyan ink. After purchasing/installing a complete new set of Epson ink cartridges, it won't print anything, even after repeated ink head cleanings. A complete waste of time and money. I have a similar problem with a more expensive Epson printer, but at least I can nurse it back to life with repeated head cleanings.Do not buy this printer, or accept it for free with rebate coupons."
2,Ink Costs are way too HIGH,"This is a horrible buy! I have had this printer for less than a year and I have had to replace the ink cartridges monthly. If I do not get the double black cartridge, I have to replace the black cartridge every couple weeks. I do not do a lot of printing and I have yet to use it for photos. The cartridges run between $25 and $32 each and there are 4 different cartridges. I am going back to the HP, it may cost a little more on the start but the savings in ink are going to be worth it!!"
2,"Worked fine at first, then declined","The printer worked fine at first, printing beautifully. Set up was a breeze. I've had the printer for several months now, however, and I've noticed the print quality slowly decline.I keep regular maintanence on the inkheads, cleaning and aligning them as necessary. I only use Epson ink, I've never refilled or damaged the ink cartridges in any way. I am unsatisfied with this product, and will not purchase another Epson."
1,Printed great at first - then died,"I bought my Epson printer with my new PC. It was loud and jerky, but the print quality was good. The factory ink cartidges have almost nothing in them, so you have to replace them pretty quickly. When I installed all new cartidges my printer quit printing in black. I contacted Epson and they indicated I might have to buy new cartidges again. I searched on the web and found there are thousands of people who experience the exact same problem I have and Epson knows all about it, but they won't fix it. My Epson printer, new as it is, is now sitting in the trash. I put my old HP 722C back on my desk and have had no problem with it ever. I will never buy another Epson product again. And from what I've read of other user's reviews they feel the same way. Epson is junk."
1,Do not buy this printer!,"I have been a loyal Epson ink jet user for many years. In addition to the C84, we currently operate a C42 and a photo stylus 2200. All 3 printers are used heavily for various job types. Only the C84 is problematic. Two weeks ago, the printer stopped printing black. Thinking it was out of ink, I replaced the cartridge ($). This did not fix the issue, so I called Epson, who charged me to talk to them ($$). I was advised to run several print head cleanings, and to shut the printer off overnight. Still no fix. I was then advised to drop the printer off to a ""local"" tech, who charged me $45 just to do a diagnostic ($$$). After a week in the shop, I was told the print head is damaged, and that it will be cheaper to buy a new printer than to repair this one ($$$$). I will replace this printer - you can be sure it won't be with an Epson."
1,Disappointing - A Ripoff - A Failure - F - Zero,"I purchased the C84 in June 2004. It stopped working October 2005. I did not use the printer very much, but sure bought a lot of ink. In the last battle with the printer, after black ink was low, replaced with new cartridge, but then black ink stopped working altogether, followed shortly thereafter by all blank pages, even after 5 nozzle cleanings. Decided to replace color cartridges even though they weren't completely empty. Still got nothing but blank pages. Tried cleaning 3 more times, but nothing but blank pages."
2,"Worked OK, then died expensively","I bought the Epson Stylus C84 about two years ago. It worked well printing text. It was OK, not spectacular, for printing photos.The aspect of this printer I dislike is that it dies in an expensive way. It starts to leave missing streaks in the print. Changing the inks costs much ($36 for the black cartridge alone). At first, changing the ink cartridge works well. You change the cartridge and the printer works well again for awhile. Then, the empty streaks start to appear again and you change the cartridge again. No improvement! You can follow the online help suggestions and they tell you to check alignment and do head cleanings. No improvement. If you call customer support, they want $9.95 just to talk to you. In the end, you get stuck with a printer that is prohibitively expensive to repair and you have a pile of useless new expensive ink cartrigdes. I find this frustrating."
3,Ink Eater!,We have had this printer for about 6 months and although the print quality is good it drinks ink at an alarming rate. It is also substantially slower than the specs would indicate. This is in large part due to the draft quality of the output being almost unusable. Perhaps I was spoiled with the HP Deskjet who's draft output was sufficient for 99% of our needs.So far we have gone through about 6 reams of paper and 2 sets of ink. At an average of 30 dollars a cartridge we should easily exceed the cost of the printer in the first 9 months.
1,2 for 2 failures,"I bought my first C84 brand new several years ago for about $50.. so don't even think about paying 200 here! I don't remember were I got it though. In any event, it died after about a year of infrequent use... yeah, the quality was great when it worked, but the color print heads got jammed or something and it refused to print color. I sold it, and bought a used one for $10 bucks, and it died within the month. Very low quality. I strongly discourage anyone from buying this printer. And that's not to mention the fact that ink replacements cost as much as a new printer!"
1,Bought two-both died!,"I loved these printers at first. But like so many others the printheads jammed. One lasted a little over a year, the other ten months. I am getting the replacement for the one in warranty but not the other. How many loyal customers have they lost with this little number. They need to just give you credit on a better printer, but why would they? We just keep making money for them by buying cartridges and running cleaning cycles. Don't buy this printer!"
2,ink coast is not the only problem,"I have bought this printer about three years ago. It worked great on any photo paper I purchased. Just this passed summer they must of changed the ink, because I was getting cracked paint effect on the photos. I called Epson to find out that You can only use dura bright photo paper and nothing else. so the ink is not only costly, the paper is to. The quality is very good if not better."
2,Concern with reliability and ink,"I agree with the other reviews concerning unit reliability and cost of ink. When the printer is working the quality of the output it good. After 10 months ownership, the unit stopped working properly. I called up Epson and they sent me a refurbished unit free of charge. However the replacement unit did not print at all. I call them back and they sent a second refurbished unit. This one did not work out of the box either---the printer head would not move. So I called them back third time and they are now sending a new unit. In short I have considerable concerns about reliability. In addition, I find the cost of the ink very high and agree with the comment around the high use of ink when attempting to clean the heads. I do not plan to buy an Epson again after this experience."
1,"Never, Ever Epson Again","See the above; same C84 Printer, same experience. Black stops printing, cartridges replaced, nothing helped....now I have a bunch of cartridges and no printer. I dont need a $45 ""diagnosis"" to tell me what I already know: this printer is a lemon and mine is a dead lemon.Never again, Epson."
1,Add me to the LONG list of unhappy campers!,"Looks like my C84 has finally bit the dust too. Doubt if anyone else is even coming here any longer to read reviews on this model, but after reading all these, and now, my own experience, I'm done with Epson."
2,Stay away from C84,"This seemed like a good value when I bought it. And it worked fine- at least for a while. But after 13 months of very limited use, it konked out-- yes, that's one month after warranty ended. And Epson wanted $10 just to talk to me. Skip it-- my Canons and HP's have held up better. Forsyte."
1,Epson C-84 stylus printer,"I was very pleased with the quality and performance with this printer. I've had it about 8 months now and it won't work at all. I put all new cartridges in and ran out all the ink trying to unclog the print head. How do they get the ink to come out during the cleaning process but not on the paper when trying to print something. Epson has poor tech support that they try to charge you for. This printer is a waste of money! Don't buy! Trust me, don't buy an Epson C-84."
2,Stops printing even if one cartridge is out,"The real problem with this printer is that if any of its four cartridges is out, it won't print at all. I most of the times use black ink and hardly do any color printing, but during the process of cleaning itself it consumes color cartridges. When any of the color cartridges is out, no more even black printing. So it is really bad. Pinting quality, however, is fine."
2,Epson Stylus C84 TRASH IT!!,I bought this printer about two years ago or less. I just bought three new ink cartridges and put them all in. It wouldn't print in color. I tried cleaning the heads but it still didn't work. I asked an Epson representative at Best Buy what he thought he said he never heard of it doing that. LIAR!!! The ink sucks your wallet dry!! I hardly ever print anything and it seems like it is always running empty very quickly. I take the cartridges out and it seems like there is alot of ink left. It's junk. Don't buy it!!
2,Requires some glossing to get the most out of it.,"Stuart Aitchison, Red Rock - Sacred Mountain: The Canyons and Peaks from Sedona to Flagstaff (Voyageur, 1992)Despite the title, what one finds here is not a travel guide. Rather, Aitchison's book is a look at the ecological history of the region, with the somewhat expected added commentary. The history itself is quite interesting, and visitors to the region are sure to find much of interest here. The book's problems begin (and, really, end) with Aitchison's periodic commentary on how awful it is that, essentially, humans exist to disturb the delicate balance of nature. If you can get past that, it's a readable book, and the pictures are fantastic; the problems is, there's a whole lot of it. **"
3,Mini Animal Dog Toys,"I do feel you can get these cheaper in the store... My little Baby loves to play with little toys, but she doesn't play with this one much..."
2,fragrance free but still has a scent that bothers me,Scents give me severe headaches. The conditioner still has a scent so I cannot use it. Believe that conditioners stay in your hair after using even after rinsing. So I cannot use it. But the Earth Science shampoo is great and has no lasting scent!!!
2,generic masque,"After using an avocado masque that I got during my last trip to Europe (made in the UK), I tried to find it on amazon. I didn't find the exact same product, so I decided to give this one a try. It's a very generic masque, not much different that any regular conditioner. Maybe if I didn't have the other masque to compare it to (which was absolutely great), I would have liked it better. Will keep looking."

5,"This book brings light,",comfort and options for that painful problem...You might even find it's a blessing.Just read it and get back at me...
5,EL DERECHO DE SER AMADOS,"En ocasiones el problema es emocional y en ocasiones efectivamente no pueden tener un bebé, pero bueno eso no es lo importante, lo importante es que aceptemos lo que DIOS decida, ya que siempre va a ver opciones de poder tener un bebé, hay muchos que desean tener una familia y ser amados, también ellos tienen derecho a ser felices.. Este libro te ayudará."
1,The lock lasted less than 2 days...,"so now the book is useless to my son! There's nothing wrong with the book itself, but the lock was the whole reason my son wanted it."
2,Product not as shown,"Good thing this bag is free, It's got only one divider (not good for supporting your camera with lens attached) and has almost no padding, in fact the only padding it has are the side pockets that are filled with foam sheets, use them for anything else, and whoops, there goes your padding.Anyway, Product is not as shown."
4,Not as pictured.,"This is a very nice camera bag for the price. BUT it is NOT the same as the picture. Inside color is royal blue, not gray. Has only one divider, not two."
4,Gunny Hathcock set the standard for Marine Snipers.,"Gunnery Sergant Carlos Hathcock is a patriot and a hero. His service in the United States Marine Corps set the standard for Marine Snipers. This is the only video I have ever seen that Gunny Hathcock describes some of his encounters in war. This video is not the greatest quality, but it is for the Gunny Hathcock admirers. Unlike the book, Marine Sniper, Gunny Hathcock does get compensation for this video. Get it."
4,Rare Insight into a true legend,"For fans of military history, sniping, or GSGT. Hathcock - this is a must. The film quality is not the usual studio quality, but more of a home video. This is understanable due to the subject's reclusive attitude with the media. I'm sure he only agreed to give this interview because of his respect for Maj. Plaster (Maj. John Plaster USAR - Vietnam Vet and author of MACV/SOG). Now that this hero has passed away, this is the only chance to hear of his experiences in his own words."
1,Marine Sniper Legend Carlos Hathcock Video Really 'Tanks',"It's no small wonder that this man had never before given (supposedly) an interview. When it comes to being an interesting interview subject, this guy is a seriously dull tool and the quality of the video itself is strictly bad home video. The few Vietnam stories explored are barely surface scratched and there's a bunch of other training and post war stuff that no one could possibly care about. Don't waste your money. There are no insights into the Vietnam war to be found here."
5,Loved it! The best autobiography I've read in years.,A very absorbing tale. A believable telling of analmost unbelievable life.
3,"Great ideas, good anecdotes, unsympathetic characters","Much of the book has explicit homosexual action throughout the book, which made it very difficult for a number of people in my college English class. It's the story of Delany's first few years out of high school, when he was trying to make it as a science fiction writer, as well as figuring out his own sexuality. One of Delany's prime characters is a self-described ""geriatric rapist."" This man, along with a few other characters just make you sick about humanity. Still, there are some great psychological observations and neat little stories inside this book. W.H. Auden and Bob Dylan both make an appearance, although Auden's is much more memorable."
4,A View Inside the Creation of Books,"This children's book is designed to show kids how a book is produced. It isn't just for children though, if an adult wants a quick overview of how the publishing of a book works, this is a great book.It has good pictures that illustrate each of the steps in the publishing/printing cycle. Each picture shows you some of the machines involved and the people involved. For printing pictures, the book also illustrates the four-color book.The story follows the creation of the book Green Beans by the author to the time children have it in their hands. This is a very informative book and comes with a glossary to go over some of the terms used.I would recommend this book to children wanting to learn where books come from."
4,Nice but can't compare to Cutco,"I purchased this shears based solely on the Wusthof reputation. I use their knives exclusively and have always been happy. The shears are no exception. They are nicely made and extremely sharp. The fact that they come apart for easy cleaning is another plus. In fact they are built like a lighter duty version of my Cutco 77 shears right down to the serrations on one blade which keeps whatever you are cutting from sliding out of the blades. It is only when you compare this shear to the Cutco that you notice the lack of heft and quality feel. That is not to say this feels cheap, it doesn't.The one negative is that I noticed is that the plastic stop that is built into the handle seems to slide past its stop and tries to skew the scissors.If you aren't able or willing to afford the Cutco 77, this will make a fine long-lasting shear at an extremely good price."
5,It's a gold mine!,"As a veteran educator and an instructional coach, I'm often asked by teachers for resources to help them with formative assessments that are different than the standard quiz or essay. This book is a gold mine! The summarization activities in this book are fabulous ways to assess student learning. This book can help any teacher, new or veteran, who is trying to find a new ""tool"" for their instructional toolbox. I highly recommend it."
4,Myreview,"It is an ok book in my opinion, yet I was expecting more ideas of assessment type of assistance to enable my students to be successful in a test."
2,What a waste,"CRISS training and a good education will teach you everything that is already in this book...not much new. Unfortunately for this great author, this particular book does not live up to the reputation."
3,A 5-star story with a lazy shrug at the end,"I sank into Open Heart with delight, having just finished Journey to the End of the Millenium, a wonderful book. Yehoshua's humor and sophistication won me over in both books. He knows people. And the translations were excellent. Still, the final pages of Open Heart were a big disappointment: it was as though he'd had to rush off and couldn't be bothered to finish what he'd started."
3,someone write me with opinion,"I agree with the opinions written. However, I would like to ask what people think of the ending. What is your opinion of exactly how it ended? Maybe i lost interest and didn't look closely enough. thanks"
3,"vivid descrip. of India; eccentric, obsessing characters","After reading this book, I have wanted to travel to India-that is how fascinating and compelling the descriptions were; plus, while reading, the charcters' obsession for India, and what it stands for to them, evokes more empathy for the characters, and their story. The character portrayals are very realistic. I did not always like the characters, but I could visualize them. The story is very compelling. Even if the main character is not sympathetic (and actually very annoying at times), those around him are sympathetic; they are less complicated and more fanciful. What is interesting is how one can see the characters as Benjamin sees them, but without his influence. So, even if Benjy looks down on them, we, as readers, do not have to join him."
3,Tedious and overwritten,"Overall, both on the level of style, delivery, character development, pacing and plot, Open Heart is disappointing. Yehoshua is a master of the complex style of fiction; of breaking up a narrative, of exploring the perimeters of what makes a novel tick. Here there is none of that. There are peculiar, italicized beginnings to each chapter, which appear to do little in the way of clarifying what happens within, and as an experiment, leaves the reader scratching his or her head. The novel is overwritten; some very beautiful bits of writing about India are sandwiched between much material that is overwrought and unnecessary.One quality redeems: The novel is a convincing narrative of a young surgeon. Yehoshua did his homework, mastering the terminology and mind set of the working doctor. But even that can not save this novel from mediocrity. Open Heart is not this author's best work; and certainly, should be placed low on any reading list of his work."
5,"One of my favorite cookbooks...tasty, interesting, easy!","I have always loved Mexican food. This is a particularly great book, because it describes favorite recipes of dozens of Mexican-American families throughout the United States. Unlike many recipes I have cooked from other Mexican cookbooks, the recipes in Cocina De La Familia are traditional recipes that have often been altered and simplified by families here in the U.S., using local and easier to get ingredients. I find these recipes easier to cook and shop for, but always tasty and authentic. I have cooked many of the recipes and loved nearly all of them. Thank You for this wonderful cookbook Ms. Tausend!"
4,Mexican cooking in the USA that makes sense to what I know..,"I'm fascinated by this book. I cook Mexican food all the time- my inlaws are Mexican. I've taken notes of their legacy recipes along side of the actual cooking experiance with ""Mom"" many times and have recorded her technique and food. This book and the recipes ring true to what I know about Mexican cooking in the USA. I have many cook books about Mexican food that are ""purist"" in their approach and I read them for insight into technique and ingrediants. This ""Cocina De La Familia"" cookbook more accurately approaches what happens in my own kitchen when I modify a purist recipe. I've cooked several dishes from this book and plan to cook more... The history of lost and then regained ingrediants, over generations, in cooking Mexican food in the USA is a special treat."
5,Best Mexican Cookbook on the market!,"I've tried them all, being that my significant other is from Mexico, I'm always looking for true, traditional Mexican recipes and this book is it! Truly the best I've seen!!! Excellent explainations of each dish, its origens, and how to serve it. I highly reccommend it!"
5,Usual and unusual recipes with interesting anecdotes.,"I saw this book at the library, and after checking it out for a month, decided I had to have it. It does have recipes for Mexican foods commonly served in US restaurants, but there are also many unusual dishes from obscure places. The short anecdotes with some of the recipes make it all the more interesting to read. For these reasons, several of my friends and I have ordered copies, both for ourselves and for gifts. Buen apetito!"
4,lots of great recipes my mexican husband loved,the book was filled with excellent recipes that he says is the real deal from mexico. he has tried a few of them and loved them so much. reminds him of home again. thanks for the book
4,A wondeful metamorphosis of mexican cuisine.,"It was fascinating reading how certain recipes have evolved between their native land and into the mainsteam US. Inspite of changes, the foods remain basically true to their roots -- the book shows the passion and the pride of Mexicans to their homeland no matter where they end up living."
3,pretty good,"i'm a pretty traditional cook, i dont like to used canned products and such, but this book is actually pretty good as far as mexican american food goes."
1,Misleading product illustration,The picture in the add shows the bike rack loops with the platform. It would appear that since the platform is black as is the loops that the entire assembly was included. This is not the case. It costs an additional $90 to buy the platform unit. Very misleading.
3,It's just ok,"Got the part from amazon, they shipped fast, the part is ok, not great, actually a bit flimsy, and not really worth the 35 dollars I paid for it, but it works, this part was described in a way that seemed like you were going to get the whole rack, but you dont"
2,Waste of money,"unless the bike has the tire the same width as the adapter it doesn't work.I looked for this for over a year befor I found on Amazon.I had to create an adapter to attach bikes to so they would not fall over.I would bend the wheel before getting straps tight enough to hold upright.You also can't open the back door or hatch glass with the bikes in place.I wanted it to quickly add bike to for fast trips in town but between fabing an adapter and the additional issues, no time saved."
2,Misleading picture and description,"The picture shows what is not included (in gray) color and what should be included in (black), but what I received was only the bike holder (3 vertical wheel separaters) on the picture, the platform in NOT included, and it doesn't say anything about it not being included in the description either, it just says that the straps are not included.... sending back for a refund."
2,Wrong picture (cofusing),"Hi,i think the picture you are using for this product is confusing, because you have on the picture the all basket not only the bike attachment."
1,Didn't get a chance to watch it..,When i ordered it from Amazon i had no idea they would send me a DVD case with NO DVD in it..so i couldn't tell you how the movie was...be careful what you order...
5,"""RED"" the perfect descripcion of falling in love !","when you are a lone and you need relax, good things for think about it, travel to a romantic world..'RED' is your perfect cd, and ESPEN LIND is the person with the most beautiful voice. he describe with a sweet words and magic music all his fellings about love, friendship, the good moments in ours lives! ESPEN LIND has a big 10 with RED."
5,A Really Great Talent!,"Espen Lind is a kind of allround talent. He not only wrote all the songs himself, he also played every instrument except the strings. The result is by no means monotonous - the album is the best debut that I have ever listened to. Espen Lind deserves a great portion of respect!"
5,Espen Lind-Red,"Espen Lind has the most incredible voice I've heard in a long time. I heard Hallejulah and was spellbound with the 4 singers from Norway. I love music I can sing or hum along to. When I listen to him sing, it is pure beauty and he's not bad to look at either. He plays several instruments and does so on most of his music. There is a reason he has won Norway's Grammy type awards. He writes, sings, produces, plays the instruments, and does all that perfectly. I wish he would make another record."
3,greening accounting,Thats the great book and very helpful for my disertation... IT useful for everyone that interested with accounting that related to environment. That very basic book for U that study environmental accounting. I searching everywhere then I founded in Amazon...... Thanks for Amazon
2,Blotchy,"This printer prints poorly. When the ink gets low you will notice it more, but it can print with noticeable lines and the ink can get blotchy. It does tend to grab more pages when you fill it up. Is is ok for things you are only going to look at, but not for a resume. It's cheap, that's all I have to say about it."
5,Beautiful,It is only a poster...until you frame it! I put this in a nice frame I purchased from Target for $29.99. It looks amazing! I used a black frame for this but I am sure that a wooden frame would also look amazing. Came on time in very reliable packaging. Very Nice!
5,Perfect!,"This item was shipped and received quickly first of all and then... I opened it. I could not believe the quality of this poster. The paper it was printed on was heavy, the print was clear and the color was perfect. I was also pleased that it arrived in pristine condition. Great buy!"
5,Great fun for a great price,"These choppers are just plain fun to fly, and they are responsive to the controls - a light touch and an hour's practice and you are flying! Not suitable for younger kids - say under 7 or 8. They seem to be durable despite looking rather fragile."
2,Gift,The helicoptor arrived missing parts with some parts painted and other parts not painted. Very dissappointing. More plastic than I thought when I bought it also.
4,helicopter fun,"Great educational toy. Not intended for young kids, unless you don't expect it to last long. very realistic looking! I want one for my shelf!"
4,All Animal Lovers,"... will find this book an interesting read. I found it purely by accident, and am really glad I did -The stories are captivating, and I can relate to most of them. I read Laurie Conrad's ""The Spiritual Life of Animals and Plants"" last year, and was completely mesmerized by her free-flowing, personable style. I think anyone who has read her beautiful work will also very much enjoy ""God's Messengers""."
4,A must read for new parents,I just finished reading this book and loved it! The concepts presented in this book really helped me figure out how to integrate the concepts of financial success with raising my child. I can't imagine a better gift to give my daughter than helping her to be financially responsible. Imagine how different the world would be if everybody read this and encouraged this behavior their children! Exactly the kind of inspiration I needed with a new child.
4,good review,"Good paper, good condition and the delivery was before the time expected.I enjoy buy in amazon. It was my first experience and i can say was good. Thank's Amazon team."
4,Silver Lapas Cross,"This item was much nicer than I expected, for the price. It accomodates a good size chain."
5,Joy and scholarship,Strongly recommended to anyone with a sense of humour and a love of art as well as a serious interest in New Testament scholarship.
1,Woefully outdated,"I am a graduate student majoring in teaching technology and I thought this book might help my research, but it is very outdated. Unless you are in a school that has no technology at all, you might want to skip this one."
1,100% piece of junk!!!,"Don't purchase this model. It is a worthless piece of junk. I've used mine a total of 6 times, and now the pan keeps popping out, rendering the machine useless unless I babysit the thing and hold the pan in place. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MODEL!!!"
1,"Disjointed, no plot, bad writing style!!!","This was the last book in a series which I borrowed from a friend (thank god I didn't BUY these things!) I speed read and love to read sci/fi and fantasy, but I could BARELY keep myself interested in these sad works of fiction. In short, use them for firewood before reading them, you'll be glad you did."
3,"I like the book, but not the protagonist","It was a little predictable, but I enjoy fantasy novels that detail the workings of magic, if it's done well, rather than those that simply leave it at ""the old guy with the robe and the staff wiggled his fingers and *poof*.""That being said, I kinda loathed the main character, which I don't hink was the purpose of the book. He wasn't supposed to be an anti-hero or anything. I found him to be sanctimonious and very hypocritical.This did detract from my enoyment but I would still recommend the series. The first two books were a little slow, this one had better pacing, but they did a good job of setting up the final book."
3,"""Stunning"" doesn't quite cover it","I sat with this book for 4 solid hours, in aew. Packed with incredible photos of creatures so bizarre that you couldn't invent anything even close to this reality. Hoyt explains the layers of the sea and what lives there, why and how each atmosphere creates and hosts it's own World. It tells in plain language how these creatures live, eat and reproduce and find each other in the pitch black. It's rare to find a book who's text and visual offerings are equally astounding and educational. I came away with a feeling that all I thought I knew about the sea and life on Earth had just been rewritten for me. This book is a genuine treat and a glimpse into all the possibilites of Life in our ""not human"" terms."
4,Great for Preschoolers,"Overall I think this is a great product. My daughter received this product for her 4th birthday this past November. And, it's still in great condition. She loves listening to her own music, that was very easy to download to the device. I was able to take her CD's that she loved listening to @ home & put them onto her player. I also loved being able to set the maximum earphone volume. The only thing that she didn't like was the earphones. They were too large for her head, despite them being adjustable. But, that was easily fixed, because her headphones for her storyreader book set fit perfectly & works w/ this device."
4,Very nice product,"So far, I really like this cordless keyboard/mouse combo. It was a little bit of a pain to set up (I had to install the software first before connecting) but so far, so good. In case anyone was wondering, the mouse is not an optical mouse, but it moves smoothly on my mousepad. If you're not looking to spend a lot on a cordless keyboard/mouse combo, this would be worth getting-another fine Logitech product!"
1,"The author of the book ""shows his tail.""","I am a computer science major and I took a course which required this book. The book has terrible explanations of difficult concepts to grasp. My professor even thought the book was terrible. He said that the material in the book is geared towards a graduate student level. This is definetly not a good book to learn the basics of programming or for that fact, Java."
5,The right level - the right book,"Thank you Prof. Standish. This has been likened to a ""graduate level book"" by other reviewers, I am in complete agreement. As such it is pitched at the right level for the consulting professional who needs facts & code to refer to, as well as knowledge to glean."
3,Future Editions,Egan has made several books from one therory which he appeared to constantly develop! although this may lead us to thinking that this is organic it has remained a model of helping or counselling that never reaches new depths or broadens its client group. Its strength is that its simplicity makes it a very easy model to teach which which gives students easy to follow pathways to counselling skills - probably this is why it was so popular on counselling courses in the UK for so long. Does anyone know if Egan has written a later than the 5th Edition or what he is currently publishing.

4,"Informational, but long","This book is a pretty good read. There is a lot of useful information for anyone looking to be a counselor, therapist, or just want to learn how to help better. The reading is a bit wordy, as it usually is with any text book, but its definitely worth a glance for anyone going into the helping field."
5,Very informative and fascinating,"I purchased this book for my 12 year old son when he wanted to make a Halloween costume based on Egyptian themes. It was so informative and interesting, with helpful (and educational) illustrations. We both enjoyed the book."
3,An interesting beginner's book,"This is a fine book for an older child who is discovering the joys of archaeology and the most famous find of all. It is though a little sketchy in its narrative, and considering the great wealth of materials from the tomb, it could certainly have lots more pictures of the artefacts.However, it is a fasinating enough topic in itself, and would keep most younger readers amused for some time - especially young boys who sometimes scorn fiction. Here is a real life tale which outshines most made up stories!"
3,GENERATIONS,"Several generations of women live in one apartment and share (or sometimes hide) their problems. Strangely their problems are often unexpected and not at all what you would believe their respective problems to be. They are common problems... unwanted pregnancies, infidelity, broken families, etc. But the people affected by them are the most interesting and telling part of the film. This is not the best film I have ever seen, particularly from the usually very good Russian cinema, but it is passable and will engage you."
3,"Fishing Basics, Gene Kugach","I found Fishing Basics to be pretty basic! Or, what one would consider a common sense approach to fishing. The funny thing is everything is simple once someone takes the time to explain it. One example in Fishing Basics is what time of day to fish based on the season - now I know why I wasn't catching any fish on a hot day with no over brush or underpass to provide shade for the fish! Now who would ever guess that fish like shade on hot days just like us humans. Another good section was on fishing ""structure,"" which addressed where to fish in lakes, ponds, river banks, etc. About a quarter of the book was dedicated to Lure making. When you consider that you can buy a lure for under $2 versus buying materials and tools to make the lures, this wasn't a turn-on for me. Rick, South (New) Jersey"
5,Great book for a beginner,My son is 12 and has been fishing for a few months and found this book to be very imformative and helpful. He originally checked it out at the library and found that he needed one on his own book shelf. He said it has 'very valuable' information.
2,"Okay, not great",Definitely not for saltwater fishermen. Figures are somewhat helpful but rather amateurish. Okay but not impressive. Not really worth the expense.
1,NO!,This book's topics are so broad there's no possible way he can thoroughly cover ever topic. There is just not enough depth to the information.
2,"Not too bad, but there are better books out there","The second half of the book (chapter 6 and forward) is OK. It's objective and useful. But the way the first half is presented is confusing and left me with a lot of questions. The basics of fishing techniques and tackle are not organized in a very intuitive way. I had to buy another basic book (The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fishing Basics) to get a better idea and have my questions answered. The explanation on when and where to fish is pretty decent, though. Towards the end of the book, however, two chapters are wasted with instructions on how to make your own lures. I think that belongs in another book."
5,great,"The product differed from the picture provided, but serves its purpose nonetheless. The packaged arrived quickly and without damage. A good product at a great price!"
2,Wireless or Wiremore?,"If you like portability then this is the keyboard and mouse for you. For the price, this is an excellent package; as long as you never turn off your computer. The range of the receiver to the keyboard and mouse is very good, as a matter of fact you can eek-out more than the manufacturer recommends. The bad part is the ID Connection. Everytime I shut down the computer and turn it back on the mouse no longer communicates with the receiver. When this happens I must reestablish communication by pushing a button on the receiver and then a button on the mouse. Sometimes I lose communication between the keyboard and the receiver after attempting to restart the mouse. The mouse is full-size, which is nice and the scroll works very well. But the communication problem rises to the top of my complaint list."
2,Poor fit in final install,"For a product designed by the speaker manufacturer for rough in installation, I was very disappointed. The product is all plastic and although I did not prefit the speaker prior to rough in, every speaker was difficult to install after sheet rock up and project complete. In order, to get the speakers to fit in, I have to shave the edges of the rough-in frame to get the speaker to seat properly. This was true for all 5 speakers I installed.So far (5 months), speakers are solidly in wall and no issues. I am concerned about the life of the plastic mounts, but will see."
2,Good maze book for beginners - but short and overpriced,"My 3-year-old daughter loves the mazes she finds in her coloring and activity books, so I finally indulged her by getting her first book devoted to mazes.To my surprise, she completed half the book in the first sitting. The book is of good quality, and the mazes are appropriate for beginners who don't quite have the patience or motor skills for complex mazes. However, for $4.94 I would have expected something with more mazes, or at least more than black and white pages with simple illustrations.If you're willing to spend $5 on a maze book, I would recommend steering away from this one and paying a little more for one of the books by Kumon to get more bang for your buck."
1,Boring,We were disappointed with this one. The mazes are TOO simple. My three year old- just introduced to mazes- found no challenge here.
3,Sudoku Game,My mother loves the game but the lighting is terrible. Very hard to see the screen. Needs better lighting.
2,Sudoku game with nightglow,"Ordered this as a gift, was back ordered, canceled order, order was sent and billed anyway. Game screen is very hard to read, must be held at just the right angle. Otherwise easy to play."
5,Good stuff,Ordered for my daughter for Christmas. Good price and good turnaround. She likes it alot. Thats good enough for me.
1,Too hard to use,I gifted this to a relative. She tried it and promptly put it in a drawer and went back to the puzzle paperback book. A waste of money in my opinion. The Radica Sudoku Game is much easier to use.
3,Good and fun but a few issues,"I'm content with this product. If you're picky though you may not be. The stylus works well, the game play is fine (how much do you expect from a Sudoku game?). The downside, it's hard to see, often you have to tilt it to see the numbers, the light helps but it still can be difficult to see. It shows you some kind of high score list at the end but it's hard to read and it flashes off the screen very quickly (I'm not really interested in a high score list though so that doesn't bother me). Also, sometimes I have to turn it off and turn it on multiple times because it seems to lock up for whatever reason whyen starting (when it plays it's little Atari like intro sounds, it freezes on one and stops... very irritating).."
2,I think I got a lemon,"I would like to praise Amazon for accepting the return with no hassle. I plan to order another one of these and see if I have better luck. The battery I received had a partial charge when I received it, and it worked in my camera. The problem was that it would not recharge afterward. I suspect this is an isolated case as the original battery that I have and the charger are Panasonic and they both work. I would have preferred that Amazon would have allowed a direct even exchange rather than a refund. As it turned out, I ended up having to wait a few days for Amazon to verify that they would indeed accept the return. So now I have to re order separately. But Amazon did make good, so I have no complaints about the customer service."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY!,"OK, now I have your attention, go purchase the Lenmar equivalent here on amazon. 25% of the price, and just as good. I have been using them for three years with zero problems. They have generally outlasted the OEM batteries."
5,A long photo outing,I was out photographing all day and could not recharge my battery. The second battery was a life saver or rather a photo saver
4,So Far so good......,"I have really used it much, but it looks good. I will write more after my vacation soon."
3,It's a battery,"It's a battery, it fits the Lumix FZ50. It costs fifty bucks, which is probably about twice what it's really worth but if you need a battery for an FZ50, it is your only choice as far as I know. It does do the job, although it leaks away a full charge within a week while sitting in your camera bag. I'd recommend removing the battery from your camera if it's going to sit unused for very long."
4,Decent step down ring,"This ring does exactly what it is intended to do. I used it to attach an old 28-80mm lens to my new 18-135 on the T3i. It does indeed allow you to take macro shots, and some rediculously close ones at that. The nature of attaching the two lenses together does create a vignette, but that has nothing to do with the ring. The ring itself seems fairly well made, and fits to both lenses well. I do have to use a 58mm coupler, which is another thing to buy seperate from this."
3,lame,1.5x isn't as big a difference as I thought it would be and not worth the price compared to other lenses.
3,Vignette,Be aware that you will have vignette until you get almost to maximum telephoto with the Fugi S7000 camera.
4,good,"came on time and in okay condition, was what I ordered and I am somewhat satisfied with the product, parrt of the case was chipped thanks"
4,Porco The Great!,"This was an awesome Miyazaki film. It was racy, adventurous and fully entertaining for the very young to the very old. I loved it. The plot involves the misadventures of a sea plane pilot whose face has been mysteriously turned into a that of a pig. The movie is pretty void of clichés. An excellent choice."
5,My Favorite Ghibli Film,"Porco Rosso doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. What you see is pretty much it.The story follows an Italian flying ace in a quasi realistic version of the Mediterranean where sea planes are a fairly regular method of transport. The pilot, Marco Pagot, was cursed under some means to have the appearance of a pig and works freelance as a bounty hunter. Over the course of the film we get a story mainly about his conflicted feeling about life, love, and dealing with pirates.I don't want to spoil the story, but this is by far one of Hayao Miyazaki's most underrated films and likely my favorite of Studio Ghibli's films (possibly tied with The Castle of Caligostro). All in all, a great film. You should buy it."
5,This is a great movie,I started with Spirited Away and got hooked immediately with these type of movies. Porco Rosso is great! Highly recommended.
1,Frustrated,"I only wish I could review this shipment that was ordered on December 8, 2012, shipped on December 11, 2012 and still have not received my order. These are Christmas presents HELP!!!"
3,"Lacking development, commitment, and a final destination.","I appreciated the clarity and authenticity of the political atmosphere, the masculinity of Porco and his relationship with the girl. The movie has solid production, but I often found myself wondering where it was going. In the end I discovered it wasn't really going anywhere.Heroes in movies need to grow. There's not a lot of growth or introspection on the part of Porco. He is who is is, he's surprised a bit by the young girl's talent, and there's little else.The Girl Who Leapt through Time, in contrast, presents a lot of lessons for the protaganist. There is a definite journey with trials that lead to a wiser and richer character. That metamorphosis is lacking in Porco."
2,Liked this one the least......,"maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there."
2,What was with that ending?,"I consider all of Miyazaki's films to be masterpieces except this one. First of all, the movie is set in Italy and nobody speaks with an Italian accent. The southern accent from the American is REALLY bad too! The animation is brilliant like in all of Miyazaki's films but I had trouble with the main character, Porco. In all of Miyazaki's other films you really feel drawn to the main character and want to see them succeed. But Porco is so...bleh. He shows so little emotion. It's really hard to like him at all. He has this curse that turned him into a pig but he doesn't even seem to care. So why should I care if he turns back into a human or not? And then there's the ending. It doesn't resolve anything. It's like the movie just ends halfway through the story. It wraps up with a voice over telling what happens next. What's up what that? That sucks! I was very disappointed with this film."
1,DISAPPOINTING!,"I've always been a Miyazaki fan with Kiki's Delivery Service and such. However, Porco Rosso is not recommended for young children as there are multiple ""moron"", ""idiot"" and other choice words throughout the film. When seen as an adult anime, the plot is sadly lacking and at the end, I really didn't care whether Porco lived or died. Go see something else instead."
5,More Miyazaki Magic,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and each of his films is special. Lighthearted, with Miyazaki's signature ""no bad guy"" roster of interesting characters(including a strong young female, another Miyazaki staple), a fun film for anyone of any age."
4,"Not one of my favorites, but sweet nonetheless","This film marks when Miyazaki started to get a little odd with his films. Not that that's a a bad thing, but Porco Rosso was certainly made with an older audience in mind.Although often credited with inspiring Disney's Talespin (it was not, Talespin started in 1990, while this wasn't released until 1992) this returns once again to Miyazaki's fascination with flying and period pieces. Perhaps a bit too cerebral for kids who like Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service, it's still a sweet introspective story. The old cliche about beauty only being skin deep was never so appropriate as it is here.As usual Miyazaki's designs are wonderful to watch as is his choreography of flight scenes."
4,Very nice.,"Porco Rosso is a rare gem of a movie. It appealed to me in so many ways, and kept me interested from the very begining. It's not Sprited Away, but then again, what is? While not my favorite Myazaki movie, it's a great film and a wonderful piece of art."
4,A classic story,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter,who as become devoted fan of Hayao Miyazaki. Yet, it is a joy to view this film with my daughter. Where my daughter and may focus on different aspects of the story and/or characters. We both greatly enjoy the fun, and loving story."
2,does not work consistently if not plugged in directly,"if you use either a KVM or PS2 keyboard/mouse extension cables, this wireless keyboard will periodically stop working---up to several times an hour.Otherwise, it's fine."
2,Too small!,"This toy is not what I expected.1. I was surprised by the size of this cart. It's only 6 inches high. Given the fact that this toy is made for children who are toddling/walking (ages 1 - 3) and that it is in fact called a ""push cart"" I assumed it would be a cart that my daughter could push around. In actuality, it is a smallish sized puzzle on wheels.2. The shapes themselves are plain plastic pieces (no rattling, crinkling or textures) and my daughter lost interest in them quickly. Also, they have a sticker label. Given the age group, I think you're asking for some grungy looking shapes since they are more than likely going to be drooled and chewed upon.3. This is more of a puzzle than a sorter, since the shapes don't go through the cart.4. It's small but it's bulky and hard to store. If I throw it in the toy chest, the shapes fall out and get lost.If you are looking for a shape sorter, there are others available that are more rewarding for toddlers."
2,Can't Sort Or Learn when it's just stickers,"We bought this cart for our then 7 month old twins. The twins are now 10 months and have completely gotten the stickers off the different shapes, rendering the learning aspect of this toy useless.This toy is designed for 6 months plus, yet the company used cheep stickers for the numbers and pictures. I have not met a baby yet that doesn't put the shapes in their mouth at this age, which means the stickers have completely come off. I am also not thrilled the babies have ingested the stickers or glue from them.We have many other toys with the same concept, but they are not designed with stickers."
4,Ask me in a couple more months.,So far I think the tool is working as I expected. It's hard to believe a tool that small puts out that much power. I don't work it as hard as my corded impact gun. It gets hot if you work it hard. I back off when it gets hot. Its to expensive a tool to work it to hard when I have a corded impact. We started using these cordless to avoid running generators. Some of our employees have inverters in trucks to recharge cordless. Its too early to see how it will hold up. There should be a follow up at a later date. So far I am alot happier with Bosch tools compared to DeWalt. I don't buy cheap tools or Asian lookalikes--they are not worth it and just waste your time and money in the long run. So far so good.
3,This breaks my face out...,"I was excited to try this, however, it breaks my face out. We all are different, so its each to is own regarding what a product does to a person. I had to give a 3 only due to I couldnt use it."
5,Very Comprehensive,"If one can gramattically apply the modifer ""very"" to ""Comprehensive"" this is the palce to apply it. This book has become an essential tool in my reference library. If you are serious about communicating an important message, this will help. I particularly like the comments on the appropriate use and potential misuse of each ratio."
5,when in doubt buy now,these shorts are now my favorite to skateboard in. very easy to move around in and no zippers to break or velcro to snag things.
3,Misses the Mark,"While it contains a few useful nuggets, this book never really addresses how to team with a recruiter to get a top position. For a more direct, concise look at working successfully with a headhunter, see ""The Road to CEO"" by Sharon Voros."
3,A Solid Effort!,"It's nice to read a book written by the fellow ""who wrote the book."" Alan R. Schonberg is that guy, the chairman of the world's largest executive recruiting firm. The insights into job hunting that he provides are well worth the classy sales pitch he offers on behalf of the headhunting profession. You wish he would give more insider headhunter's information - one senses that he has politely declined to publish all his business secrets. Still, there's a lot here to ponder. Thus, we at [...] recommend this book to people who want to turn job hunting into a process that can enhance their dignity, salary and job-satisfaction. A show of hands, please."
5,GREAT RECORD,"It is great to have new music from Kate. The entire record is simply fantastic. It has been a long wait, but this record is a true labor of love. Kate sounds great. ""Sister Kate"" is a classic and this is a new masterpiece."
4,BOY IS THIS REFRESHING!!,"Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a beautiful place like Kate's Martha's Vineyard and listen to Beautiful Road. Or in your car (but with your eyes open). The images are fresh, the backup musicians among the best--listen to the beat shift in Tin Suitcase- and you hear, unmistakeably, The Band. Chuck Leavell shimmers on piano on the title cut. And Kate's voice is SWEET. And James Taylor is, well, James Taylor. I would have him backup just about anyone. Listen to him support his sis'on I will fly."
1,Anothed burned cd.,"Like my review of her Live album - this one came in a cd case, not sealed, with a burned TDK CD, written on with magic markers. Crap. returned and cancelled the order. If I'm paying $15 for a CD, it better be the real deal."
4,Nice Stuff,"This disk is a taste of classic American music, by James' sister. I was pleasantly surprised by the melodies and harmonies, then realized the illustrious backing staff that includes her brother and Levon Helm. Lovely music that is very enjoyable."
2,Stinks of cheap perfume.,"I bought this soap to help get rid of scabies. I checked about 10 other websites for a list of ingredients, but couldn't find one... I received the soap today and they STINK, and not like neem as I would have expected. For inquiring minds, here are the ingredients as listed on the packaging:Sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate/cocoate, sodium soap of neem oil, talc, PERFUME, petroleum jelly, lauric acid, disodium EDTA, disodium etidronate, lanolin, hard paraffin, vitamin E acetate, glyeryl monostearate, methyl paraben, CI 12740, and CI 61565.The good news is you can hardly smell the neem (if that smell bothers you), the bad news is the perfume is quite strong--I can smell the soap from hall outside the bathrooms."
4,Good soap - not so great smell,"I use a neem clay face mask that is absolutely amazing! Seeing the effects neem had on my skin I thought I would give this a shot. The soap does, in fact, smell like neem...which isn't the most pleasant smell in the world...but you don't smell it once you rinse it off. I WILL recommend that those purchasing this don't leave it sitting on a ledge in the shower or anywhere it will be constantly attacked by water....the bar will slowly start to ""peel"" into layers and become hard. I personally keep mine in one of those small travel soap holders and it lasts 2-3 times as long! Good stuff...and I even received a free gift! Margo makes good, quality products! Check it out!"
2,Strong odor and leaves skin feeling tight/dry,"I'm not crazy about this soap at all. It has a very strong and unpleasant odor. It might be okay for daytime use, but I wouldn't want to go to bed smelling it on my body. It also leaves a film on the skin that is somewhat oily. I thought that it would be moisturizing, but instead it leaves my skin feeling tight and dry. That's just how it's worked on my skin. It might work for someone else. But still, the odor is pretty strong. I also purchased Maximum Strength Neem Oil Soap - 4 oz - Bar Soap by Organix and like that a lot better. It has an odor, too, but it's not as strong. It also leaves a film on the skin, but much less so than the Margo Neem soap. And I do not experience any dryness or tightness using that."
2,Made my face BRIGHT red while using,"I bought this after reading online several places how great it was for your skin & was a ""natural"" way to clear up acne, I have mild acne on my forhead & chin, I only used this soap for about 10 days, so perhaps I didn't give it a fair shot - but it made my face VERY red and it felt HOT for hours after, so I couldn't stand it and I stopped using it. I didn't notice my skin being any clearer. It did feel very clean, but the it was not worth it to me to have a bright red face from using this. Also I was not a fan of the smell of this soap."
3,Little less than expectation,"It is a good soap no doubt .It has ""Neem"" leaves which is proven to be good for skin. The soap size is very small as compared to what I expected."
5,This is The Strongest Need You Can Find,"A huge differance from homemade Soaps, Strong Neem Green! Want to get a Clean Body, Use IT!! Helps the Skin and I Shampoo with it also. After a long day a quick Shower with this Soap is The Bomb!"
4,"Very good, covers a lot of ground",This is a very good book. Bare's knowledge is from experience and is not garnished from other books. Well worth the price.
1,This book ended my film career before it started!,"In 1972, I was real excited about going to a film school and becoming a filmmaker. In the back of this book, there was a list of colleges offering film degrees. I chose one of those listed, the University of Oregon in Eugene. After a freshman year of fun, I went into my counselor and said I was ready to declare my major in film. ""We don't have a film school here."" he solemnly stated. ""But it's in the book!"" I exclaimed. I immediatly tried to get into UCLA, but the wait was 1 1/2 years. Thus endeth my pursuit of a film career (I'm now in TV advertising). I found this book recently in a bookstore and sure enough...it still lists U of Oregon as offering a film degree!!"
5,A classical book on this subject.,You must take a carefull look on this book originally writted at the turn of the century (1910). How actual are the views of this eminent German philosopher.
5,Excellent book,"I got this book for my 18th birthday when it first came out. I really enjoyed the pictures of the guys hanging out acting crazy. I'm now going to be 27 and I flip through this book every time I get down in the dumps about something. To this day, I get excited when one or all of them do something, and I look forward to what they're going to take on next."
5,very great book,this book gives a great look into the the private lives of eachof the backstreeet boys.everything from on tour to right into theirbath tubs.i recomend that you guys buy this book.im actually gonna buy a few more for my friends.by the way aj is the greatest
5,"A ""must"" for all Backstreet Boys fans!","Backstreet Boys: The Official Book is recommended for all ages from teens through adult fans of the Backstreet Boys: it could have appeared in our Children's Bookwatch for teens, but is recommended here for its appeal to adult fans as well. Packed with bright color photos of the band, this provides an 'official' book including succinct phrases describing the band's experiences."
5,GREAT BOOK,This is a great book! It has the coolest pictures of the boys! It is really a picture book with captions under the picture that the boys said about that picture! It really is a good book!
4,BSB,Was happy to find this on Amazone to purchase as a gift for a big BSB fan. Great pictures inside.
5,Review on new backstreet boys book,"First of all, the backstreet boys are a terrific group whether it comes to singing songs, dancing during songs, or writing songs. They inspire people from all around United States and infact all around the globe. This book gives a the reader a view of the bsb's unknown sides and shows things that people never saw or knew about bsb."
4,Great Holiday How to book,"I have all of Meg Cabot's Princess Diary books, I even have the release dates marked on my calendar, so I was first in line at my bookstore this morning to buy this book.In this book, Princess Mia, her family and friends share their Christmas memories and customs. There is even a section on Christmas cards, and how to say, ""Happy New Year"" in a lot of languages.Great book to learn about Christmas customs and such.``Katrina"
3,poor use of graphics,"A significant part of this book are the chapters about KeyGraph, a visualisation method devised by several of the contributors. Unfortunately, many of the screen shots are poorly done. The resolution is low, making it hard to read the text. Chapter 21 is especially bad in this regard.Plus, that chapter shows a poor use of display information. The nodes in the KeyGraph are URLs. These are written as full URLs, with the ""http://"" prefix. The graphs could have been simplified by omitting this. This follows how many browsers now will accept that input and automatically prepend the prefix if it is missing. Also, the nodes continue to waste space by often including the www prefix in the domain name. This could also have been omitted. All this would have made the graphs clearer to the reader. But not just to the reader. An actual user of the software would also benefit, by being able to concentrate on the structure of the graph, without having the unnecessary clutter."
2,Nightfighters Over the Reich,"Well laid out, somewhat sparse, informationally. Provides suitable background information, typical of the ""Luftwaffe at War"" series. Lots of good pictures, but lacks focus on any particular subject. It is simply a conglomerration of random nachtjagd photos, buy it if you want to look at pretty pictures of nightfighters, but don't look at it as reference material."
2,"nice shape, staples jam","Nice shape, easy to hold, stands upright or lays horizontal. unfortunately, staples jam occassionally and have to be cleared. a pain. wish i had purchased different product."
5,How grateful I am that this book has been written by people who KNOW what they are talking about!,"Each and every word of this book was necessary for me to read. The information could not have been written more clearly. I use it daily. Thank you, Kelli Richards and all for writing such a great one."
3,good idea,The book is an excellent idea. Very nice pictures and lots of information on the body. The posses are VERY stiff and not very helpful in studying and drawing. I was disappointed in this book and would not purchase it given the chance at half the price.
5,Valuable presentation departs from traditional anatomy books,"A professional sculptor,I am familiar with a variety of anatomy books. ""Anatomy for the Artist"" looks at the real figure in conjunction with skeletal and muscle drawings: a helpful and wonderful departure from traditional anatomy books. The author's concept of an X-Ray --- looking at bones against the skin is useful. Lack of fear in presentation of anatomy is valuable."
3,Decent reference book,This is a decent book for anatomy reference. Nice overlays and diagrams. Only complaint is there aren't really any diagrams from the side.
4,Love this as an Anatomy reference!,"I have owned this book for about 5 years now and still find myself coming back to it for some of the excellent anatomy photos. I use it as a reference for model poses, muscle movement, and basic anatomy.As a sculptor I'd love to have even more photos and from multiple sides of the models- however there are other books for that!If you are curious you can see some of my results at [...]!"
4,Beautiful book,"I have used this book to sketch, and found that the poses are fresh and the models are nice to look at. This book is really great for what it does or is for. But I have some criticisms of it as well. One, some of the poses are not natural. Two, the author really has not decided if it is artistic reference or it is a teaching tool. Third, the author implies a point that you need to totally understand anatomy to draw. NOT! Forth, is that some of the photos were cut off, if you are trying to draw a line you need to see where it goes to understand that line; the book for the most part makes that decision for you. They needed to let the whole image be seen so the artiest could make these choices. But don't get me wrong, because it is a great reference book and does have some valuable information in it. It would not be a wasted purchase."
3,Good start,"This book would have been more useful to me if it had less drawings of the skeleton and musculature and more pictures (there are only real pictures of models.) It's a good start if you are beginning to do figure drawing, but when looking for sources to draw the internal structure of hands and feet, for example, I got a clearer picture from my physical anthropology book."
4,A Must-Have,"A gorgeous, gorgeous collection of photographs, a plethora of yummy poses, and a complete reference for the human bod, this book now qualifies as my Bible."
4,some good images,"there is some very good stuff in this book, but for some reason when i need a perspective or view of something in particular to help with what i'm making, its never in this book, even though there seems a lot here. a sculptor friend agrees with me in this regard as well. i think this is worth buying for your study and its beautiful to look at, thus the 4 stars, but its not the only book you'll need. John Raynes ""Figure Drawing & Anatomy for the Artist"" is a fantastic resource for anatomy, sadly its unavailable."
4,beautiful photography in Anatomy for the Artist,"I love this book. I scouted it for some time before making my purchase. My favorite aspect is that the photos and model positioning are unusual, with fantastic lighting that would be hard to recreate unless you have a studio (I don't). It's also one of my favorite coffed table book.K"
5,A must have for serious artist,"This is the best reference guide for drawing people that I have found. The poses and lighting are excellent! Most artist references on the figure show the skeleton and muscles but this book uses semi-transparent overlays so an artist can see a photo of a person then, using the overlay, see how the skeleton or muscles shape the body. A must have for any serious artist."
5,the best i have seen,"This book is the best anatomy book i have seen.the see through sheets of internal anatomy line up with with actual human photo's so you see where in the body they really lay,and how it affects the topographic(?)lay of the skin.the lighting is great on the pics unlike a lot of anatomy books that have everything washed out with light.i could not suggest this more for a serious art student.there is full nudity and close up so people with children be warned.but it has everything hands,feet,facial expressions.sitting,standing and laying poses.even lesson using some classic art paintings.buy this before you get any other anatomy book because you might not want another!"
3,artist,"Great academic review of anatomy.However, when purchased it was purchased as new...not used.Edges of book were worn and cover was scratched.It should have been sold as good condition not NEW.ballet"
1,Updating Timex Bodylink System,"Ironman Triathlon BodyLink System Heart Rate/Speed/DistanceThe Timex BodyLink System was great in it's day. I only bought the SF891 to replace a unit that I had lost so I could sell a complete Timex Bodylink system on ebay. The associated software was also great in it's day. However, it has not kept up with Garmin line, and the 405CX carries out all the same functions in a single watch that required three components for the Timex system. The Garmin also comes with great software. The Garmin's GPS antenna is far more sensitive than the Timex, and can synchronize with the satellites indoors in areas where the Timex lost contact, an extremely valuable feature for cold-weather running. I got a better price for the Garmin 450CX on ebay than was available on Amazon."
2,the sublime of cliche,"I weep for Jeffy. The language, however base and stomach cramp inducing, does the job of transporting the reader to the suburban hell that only Keane can imagine. The amount of ennui overflowing from this wasp-ish family of innocents staggers. If you cannot see their pain, you are blind. I am Jocasta, my eyes bleed for the family circus."
4,Endearing and Sweet Story,"My Aunt Margaret gave me this book when I was eight years old (now 29) and I am sorry to hear that it is out of print. It is a beautiful story about an old woman and her seventeen cats. Through very simple language and ideas, it illustrates the notion that one is never alone as long as they are open to companionship. I loved this story as a child and appreciate it even more as an adult. The illustrations are sweet and beautiful..."
5,I couldn't but this book down,I read the whole series of the Nothern lights. I really enjoyed the series. Even thought it focused on more then one person it was very easy to follow what everyone was doing. Some you loved some you were mad at and others you just wanted to slap at times!! I felt emotional involved which made it a really good story. This was the first series i have read from Lisa Bergren and i plan on reading more of her books. I would recommed this book.
1,Stainless Steel Meatgrinder,"I thought stainless steel does not rust. After the first time using the grinder, I put it in the dishwasher.When I took it out, the little wheel with all the holes was completly rusted, also the blade in some spots. Customer Service told me that I can't put the meatgrinder in the dishwasher to clean. Clean it in the sink with a little water. I feel it should've been posted with instructions on the website not to clean in the dishwasher. I never would've bought it. I never heard of anything so ridiculous.Anything cutting meat should be cleaned in as hot of water as you can get it. The thing is useless to me now, because I can't get the rust out of the little holes. I ask customer service to send me an manual where it says not to put in dishwasher. It's been 2 weeks now, nothing. Very disappointed."
1,Mush Mess,"I trimmed some sirloin steaks spotless and still this machine did nothing but clog clog and clog, which also results in meat mush, leaking juice from the handle and mess. It was all work and no play, big mistake!"
5,A great book,"If you can get a hold of this book, please do because it looks at many interesting sociolinguistic issues. It also does this without compromising the fact that this is both a linguistic text and a religious document."
5,Battleship at War- the epic story of the USS Washington,"An excellant book which gives the average individual an insight to one of the most remarkable ships in the US Navy. Covers the history from the ships design to her scrapping. Tells in great detail, yet in a very readable text, the story of the crew, the officers and the ship in World War II."
3,You get what you pay for,"Wasn't sure quite what to expect. In one sense a 3 sword bundle for $25 is an amazing pricepoint, on the other you really can't expect good quality blades.The blades aren't very good and not sharp, the scabbard is cheap and lined with plastic, the guard is very cheap and wouldn't withstand a hit and I could go on.On the other hand they look good and professional and for the price I don't think you'll find a better deal.If you're looking for some display swords that will just sit on your mantlepiece then you really can't go wrong with these. If you're looking for anything more than that then I'd look elsewhere.Basically you get what you pay for and depending on what you're looking for these can either be very good value or a complete waste of money."
5,Wow!,Very good quality. The stand is a little small I think for the swords. It is beautiful though. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to collect swords.
1,Not worth it,"I wanted to really like this product, it looked great and I did buy it, unfortunately it's not worth it. First of all I didn't like the directions, they should have been more clear. I have windows xp (home edition) and I just had a lot of problems with it. The mouse wouldn't work at all, and then when it did work, the keyboard would just stop working, instead. I even went out and bought new batteries thinking that maybe it was low on that and that wasn't it. It was the darn keyboard!I finally got so sick of this keyboard not working at all, so I went out and bought a new wireless keyboard and mouse combo. I got the Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Pro and it works very well, it was much more easy to set up, and both the keyboard and mouse work much better. It takes a while getting used to the angular keyboard but I like it so much better than the Logitech one."
1,Hype,"Things I experienced with this product:Mouse:- Comfort is stressful- Right button is no easy to press- Tracking is jittery, sometimes not at all- Radio frequency interferenceKeyboard:- Some of the extra functionality buttons are placed in spotswhere it causes you the hit them by accident.- Radio frequency interference problems. Sometimes the keyswould not work at all or repeat 5 times with one press.I got rid of it a when back to reliable wired technology.Too bad, because I really loved the look. But for me, it has to work first, then look good."
4,Logitech Cordless Elite Duo,"I like this combination of wireless keyboard and optical mouse. It is much more convenient than my old keyboard and ball mouse were. They keyboard did not allow much movement around the room, and same goes for the mouse. Now, I can relax in bed while fragging people on counterstrike -_-. I wish the mouse had a built in li-ion rechargeable batter like the mx700 though, so i wouldnt have to change batteries. I've had the unit for 2 weeks so far, and have not had to change the batteries yet. I think that logitech should offer to sell their wireless optical keyboard and mouse separately because I would have bought the keyboard and the mx700 separately for the rechageable factor and coolness factor =). Overall, I am very happy that I made this purchase which has given me more desk space when i need it for studying etc. by easily moving the keyboard/mouse."
1,How To Fix Certain Keys Not Capping Letters And Adding Extra Spaces,"Logitech's keyboards will not cap certain keys, mine being a MX3200 digital display with a laser mouse, all cordless.Before you go crazy with their help literature, simply uninstall Setpoint completely and get back to normal. What a drag if you relied on any of the menus from Setpoint.This will stop the problem with keys not capping, which is drastic when you're working on something or writing a fast email."
2,Good concept but poorly made,"This was a gift for ""the man who has everything"". Great idea and he loved it... Until the mouse stopped working about 2 months after he got it. So now we have a wireless keyboard and our old standard wired mouse. I won't be buying Logitech again."
1,Mac users beware. PC gamers beware,Software support for OS X is terrible. Causes kernal panics and will not allow you to use Expose in OS 10.3(Panther). PC Games seem to make you jump through hoops to setup the mouse with each game. Buy an Micro$oft set instead.
3,only one problem......,"my dad got this combo or whatever and the only problem i see with it is that the mouse never goes off and it just eats up the battery...he has to replace the batteries like every 2 days or whatever...and it feels wieird...not normal like other mouses, very wieird shape"
3,You will never get Mail in Rebate,"Well, this keyboard and mouse are good. But, dont buy this if your buying it because of MAIL IN REBATE. You will never get the mail in rebate."
4,Excellent quality. Mouse sucks batteries.,"The keyboard is lightweight, robust and has a pleasant soft touch feel of typing. In addition, it has been over four months and the batteries are yet to be replaced.The mouse, on the other hand, has been through approximately five changes of batteries. I recommend buying a good set of rechargeables for this. However, response is excellent and works at a fair range from the base. I've made it work at up to ten feet with line of sight from the base unit.The extra features are great. The customizable buttons, volume wheel and on-board play controls are extremely useful - especially the play controls as they allow me to stop, start, skip forward in all of the media applications that I use (WinDVD, Windows Media Player, Winamp, RealPlayer, PowerDVD).All in all, a great buy. Don't forget the batteries."
3,Great--But watch out if you're using a laptop,"This is my favorite mouse. But I had to return it after hours speaking with Logitech and Dell. Apparently, Logitech's software conflicts with some laptop software that runs the laptop's internal touch pad and pointer. Logitech is aware of this and there is some information on its website. The alternative I chose was Microsoft. I like the keyboard better; the mouse, while fully featured, fits my hand awkwardly."
3,the keyboard worth the money you paid,"I liked the keyboard very much, it is the most comfortable keyboeard I ever used, and functional keys are very cool.However, the mouse [is bad], it is long, heavy and in a weird shape. the buttons are too small so that you need to bent your finger to an unatural angle to click it. And the thumb button is useless since you can never reach it. I know why people complain about battery life, this mouse is on all the time, even when your computer is shut down. And in my system (XP) the mouse only works when the receiver is connetected with USB, not PS/2.I guess the keyboard and mouse are designed by different people, I spent [item price] only for a good keyboard."
1,Complex wording was worse than my textbook,Complex wording was worse than my MBA textbook. I've used Schaum's in the past and they've been great. Unfortunately this one was disappointing.
3,Not what you expect from Schaum,"The book is OK for the price. The trouble is that there are too many good websites on which you can get quality education in MIcro for free. There is glut of information and solved problems in Microeconomics on the web, so in view of that the book is really not needed. Its not a bad book, but given the plethora of succinct info readily available, its not worth buying."
5,Totally Amazing!,"4 months ago, I saw Vonda in concert in Paris... SHE was totally amazing!!! That day,she played 3 songs from Chinatown (Lose My Way, My Whole World and Rainy Days) And I immediatly fell in love with those songs! And NOW I have CHINATOWN...and I can say that all the songs are really GOOD... BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND LYRICS!!! ""The Sunset Marquis"" and ""Rain Or Shine"" are to me, the best songs! Vonda shows us AGAIN that she's really talented! Let's listen ""Chinatown""!!I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Like it, don't love it","Not quite as good as By 7:30 and not nearly as good as It's Good, Eve. If you like Vonda's previous work, you'll find enough hear to enjoy, but it's not going to make anyone a fan. There are some catchy tunes, like ""Rainy Days,"" but generally the lyrics are sub-par. And while I admire her for trying new things, songs like ""My Whole World"" and ""Gyroscope"" stray too far from her core piano-based ballads that I love so much."
3,It's OK....but could have been more....,"Having loved Vonda Shepard's last solo cd BY 7:30 and her work for Ally McBeal, I was excited to purchase this new release by the talented, singer, songwriter, pianist...the album has some strong tracks (RAINY DAYS, CHINATOWN, MY WHOLE WORLD, LOSE MY WAY, DOWNTIME and GYROSCOPE) and the rest of the album is not up to par and sadly, very boring. I have never been bored by any song of hers in the past but this cd has many of them....the cd is all over the place in themes and styles, I am not sure what she is trying to say....I will always be a fan....this one just will not be played all that often. Better luck next time!"
3,Disappointed Fan,"I fell in love with Vonda's singing the first time I heard her version of ""Stary Night"". Chinatown was my fourth CD purchase and I was looking for the *real* Vonda, not the *Ally McBeal cover singer* as some of my friends used to call her. Chinatown was pure enough in creativity but disappointing in terms of that ""emotional fix"" many of her previous recordings provide. I found little worth feeling in this album, especially in the title song: Chinatown left me cold and lonely. ""Lose my Way"" was the only song I really liked. But we always forgive those we love, so perhaps Vonda was just experimenting some new stuff with Chinatown and her next album will be a return to that wonderful mixture of rock and poetry she hooked me with in the other three CDS I bought before."
2,Overpriced.,The price was reduced less than 24 hours later by $200.00. I felt very cheated. I should have explored other options befrore buying. As an old customer I am very disappointed in Amazon.
1,One-Sided Family History,"This book might be interesting if you were a member of the Pahlavi family and wanted to have a whitewashed version of history, but otherwise give it a miss. Farah writes her story with what seems like clear intent to make it sound as if she were Queen Noor with a husband that wasn't ousted for cause."
1,Greed and Opportunity,"Farah's book paints the picture of the shah as a family man, as if that excuses the brutality of his reign, although she conveniently leaves out that last bit. If she has Alzheimer's, than she has an excuse, otherwise, she is writing a false report.I'm a Brit who lived in Iran and left when Iranians revoluted against the shah's despotic rule. The originally poor Pahlavi's owned many palaces, the most expensive foreign cars (even though Iran produced cars), owned private jets, and amassed wealth. Meanwhile the shah was ruthless to any criticism, little better than the current dictators.Read ""All the Shah's Men"" to see how we and the Americans put him in power. It's fascinating that we bought the support of the shah's sister, Ashraf, for the Judas price of a mink coat and some cash."
1,I think she is still dreaming,"A true leader is Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh, the ONE and the only one, If you want the truth please read the book called All the Shah's men by Stephen Kinzer"
1,Beauty Parlor Magazine Article,"Farah had a few choices here. She could have written a Hollywood tabloid-style tell all of the shah's many marriages and infidelities. She could have thrown in accounts of self-aggrandizement and money squandering ways.Farah could have done a great political angle. Prime Minister ousted in favor of flamboyant shah who gets ousted and an even worse government takes over. This would have required research, insight, and finesse.But no. Farah goes for the queen-for-a-day melodrama and this book is just a beauty parlor magazine sob story. What a waste."
1,No Royal Blood,"I read this book with every expectation of a history of Iran during this period. Farah Diba writes a nice portrait of her husband, as if he were a benign leader and as if the Pahlavi family did good words. She omits that Amnesty International for years during the shah's reign said he had the worst human rights record in the world.The Pahlavi's have no royal blood, but Farah doesn't mention this either. The shah's fathter was a poor and crude military man who joined the Cossak brigade and overthrew the corrupt Qajar dynasty. Then he declared himself shah, and a corrupt one at that. ""All the Shah's Men"" is a fine book by a New York Times reporter that details this history.It seems nothing has changed about how the Pahalvi's spin a story. Farah writes a pleasant tale, but did she think we'd believe this? This isn't even complementary to the other real history books, it's a puff piece designed to aggrandize the Pahlavis."
5,"A riveting, touching and personal revelation","What an amazing book! I was profoundly touched by the humanity, honesty and emotional openness of the writer. What a gripping emotional roller coaster of a life. It helped me better understand what really went on in Iran during those dark years. It's an opportunity to grasp the depth of the issues at hand, feel the human anguish, and open up to a different perspective on the key players of this extra-ordinary yet very real saga."
1,The Long Goodbye,"Farah's book is slow moving in most parts. She recounts her meeting of the Shah, her life of public works and dress-up (via old pictures - I agree with a previous reviewer that this is the highlight of this boring book), and their ignominious ouster. Farah lacks the insight to see that the Shah's fate and her fate were largely of their own doing. They had a choice to be better than that, but his regime was brutal, and lacked any sort of independent justice system. The backlash was swift and brutal when it came, but they created the atmosphere for it to happen.My main problem with this book isn't Farah's lack of mental flexibility, her total lack of balance, or her omission of key facts (that would have made her family look very bad, indeed), rather my major complaint is that this book is stultifying."
2,one sided,"The Iran she describes is different than the one my Iranian friends descirbe. For example, Farah talks of building libraries for children. What she does not say, but my friends do, is that the libraries were only for the upper class. Children of the lower class had to work. There was child labor in Iran. And MOST of the population was lower class. Laboring children did not go to school and thus never learned to read. Recently I read the book: MY LAST REMAINS by Jill. It is about what happened to an American child. Toward the end of the book, she goes to Iran. I enjoyed what her comments were."
1,Evil Made Mundane,"Farah's book is a mundane recount of her marriage as third wife of the shah of Iran. She tells of their meeting, a short married life before the despot - except she doesn't mention he was a despot - was overthrown, her playing around with public works, fleeing the country, and the pariah the shah became as no country would take in the ousted dictator. She also tells of the death of her daughter. This is sort of like Eva Braun telling of her life(...), but leaving out the messy parts. Farah leaves out the parts about how the shah ruthlessly persecuted all opposition, and how Iran had the most corrupt judicial system in the world. Reviewers below sound moronic and slavish, just the sort of subjects the shah welcomed. All others were dying to get rid of him. He ran a corrupt goverment and set the stage for the even worse government in Iran today. Some legacy."
4,More a narrative than an analysis,"Zelnick's exploration into the Bush v. Gore controversy serves as an entertaining narrative and gives personality to the faces behind the legal battle. With a twinge of Republican bias (and by twinge I mean satanic Bush worshiper), Zelnick recounts Election 2000 in an entertaining day by day story. If you're looking for insightful legal or political analysis into the decision, then this is the wrong place to look, however, if you want quick read to familiarize yourself with the Conservative perspective of the case, then this is a good buy."
3,A dry delivery of interesting information,"When I wanted to find out something about the geology of central Arizona (not the Grand Canyon, not Sedona, etc), I followed my usual system of internet search, Amazon search, library search and pretty much drew a blank except for this book.I'm glad to report this book delivers the goods. It is organized into brief, convenient sections describing geology around the routes you would take driving through AZ.Unfortunately, the writing style is pure textbook tedium making the gathering of information from its pages a chore. Worthwhile (as far as I know) for facts, but almost painful to read. It could use a 21st century update."
3,Roadside Geology of Arizona,"Good book with lots of information. However, most of the pictures and a lot of descriptions were badly outdated. Overall it is a good guide but left a lot to be desired."
3,It was ok,The reading was a little dry. Hoped that there would be a little but more pictures. My 6 year old didn't really get I to it.
1,What a joke.,"This DVD really sux. What I remember most is how little of the parks they show in this DVD. They are more interested in showing you 4 actors being sterotypical and annoying. The actors over act in every scene and sometimes exaggerate facts about the park and the rides. This DVD does little to help anyone plan for a vacation and is just a poorly made commercial for Walt Disney World and it's surrounding parks. I do not recommend this to anyone. Also, this dvd is FREE from Disney website. Do not buy this."
1,Very basic introduction,"Since I love Celtic music, I am attempting to learn the Bodhran. I found this tape to be next to useless. It is a good introduction, but has little useful information. If you are an absolute beginner like me, you will find Tommy Hayes ""Bodhran Bones and Spoons"", as well as Mel Mercier ""Bodhran & Bones"" very helpful. They are both excellent, but I might give Mel Mercier an extra point for being a little more technical."
1,"Quality so poor, not even suited for a kid's toy","I bought this toy at a [local store]. The pics were so dark you couldn't see them. In full sunlight they were somewhat visible but blury. Don't waste your money,..even if you're looking for a kid's toy."
1,Had there been a Zero Star,"The worst purchase i have made. Generally my electronic purchases were good, TRV19 Camcorder Sony or Fuji S7000 are very satisfying. But this one I thought will give kids some opportunity to practice photography. but the quality is so so awful. the snaps are not even presentable. the webcam is slightlybetter and in good light, passable. but, the pics are so horrible. i thought of selling, but its a shame to even sell the stuff.So itheaded for the Dustbin. That's where it belongs.My suggestions spend 20 bucks more and get Aipec Pencam 1.3 MP. Ihave one. Much much better snap/webcam. Still better , get A300 of Canon now at 99 bucks. Aim for 3MP and up. Thats where the results are.This one is a trash. A bitter experiece!!!!"
1,Bad Cam,I have bought over 100 items from AMAZON and this is the first item I am writing a review about. I wish I had read the reviews before purchase but I actually thought no digital cam / webcam can be that bad. I got this for my daughter for Christmas because I thought it was a deal. It is a horrible digital cam and a very weak webcam. 95% of the pics taken are blurry and very pixelated (low res). Because of the price and shipping it is not worth returning. Sorry AMAZON I give this one a big thumbs down!
4,"Low price, nice webcam, terrible digital camera","It's not the best webcam, but for US$11,00 it's OK.I do not recommend use it as a digital camera, even the high quality pictures are terrible."
1,Buyer Beware,This camera is not worth anything. Most of the pictures do not even come out and those that do are of horrible quality and you have to be in the right light even for that. One good thing about the camera is that it does make a decent web cam for the price.
1,Piece of Junk,This camera works o.k for the first couple months then it breaks. I've had mine for 3mnths and the screen went fuzzy and the pictures come out with fuzz on them. It is a waste of money
2,No software available,I lost the driver CD for this camera. I cannot find the drivers anywhere on internet. Contacting Amazon / iconcepts did not solve the purpose.
3,USB Data Transfer device - product review,"This device works wonderfully for transferring data from one XP machine to another, or from one Vista machine to another. However, it does not allow you to move data between a Vista PC and an XP PC. That was a major disappointment and the reason I only give it 3 stars."
3,What they don't tell you is...,"It's only ""washable"" and ""will last a lifetime"" if you also buy their special cleaning kit. Other than that, it looks fine, air goes through it, and it probably works as advertised."
3,Rainbow Bear Plush Toy,Very disappointed that the bear was only 4in. long. I was looking for a bear around 12in. It was not stated that this was a bean bag bear. If it would have I would not have bought it.
1,Extremely poor ochestrations for a superb voice,"I love the true vocal quality of Emma Shapplin. Le Concert à Caesarea is an example of how bad the production of a disc can be. The orchestrations on some of the songs are terrible and inappropriate for such an elegant voice. Do not waste your money on the purchase of this disc. Just wait until you hear Handel's Messiah done so poorly. The tenors are out of tune and the whole idea of the Messiah on this disc is inappropriate at best. If you like disco style music, then but this disc. It is a non-classical rendition of some good music with a beautiful voice. Emma, my advice to you is to avoid any such production events in the future. You are too good to lend you voice to such trash. Jon K Shallop, PhD"
2,the molecular biology of Down syndrome,It is impossible to review this book as it has not yet arrived. This book and a number of other books I ordered have not arrived. Two thirds of my order arrived 2 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the other books. Given that I have been invited to review the book does this mean that you assume that I have received this book? Mmmmm.... I know that Amazon.com is hermeneutically sealed and all customer service is computer automated. I have always wondered what redress I would have is an expensive order goes missing. Guess I am about to find out and I don't feel optimistic.
2,Not for My Mac,"I have bought Logitech products for years but disappointed in this one. The one keyboard fits all just doesn't work here. No driver for OS9, I've had to hook up the old keyboard to get the CD tray to eject, you lose that extra usb port on the keyboard (for your camera etc.), and the mouse sucks up the batteries."
5,Very Good,"It is the best deal I have ever found in computer add-ons. It also comes with name of logitech , biggest name in pointing devices.Just Go 4 it."
2,Not for mac users.,"I looked at a lot of keyboards before deciding to go with this one. Regardless of my research, I made a mistake. The keyboard and mouse are fine, it's the Logitech Control Center software (required to run if you want to access all of the keyboards extra buttons) that ruined this product for me. Running OS X, the software COMPLETELY disabled my ability to drag and drop. Even after uninstalling it, I was still crippled. I had to do a full reinstall of my OS X software to erase the corruption. Now, I can drag again, but I can not access all of the keyboard's features. I do NOT recommend this product for a mac user. It's a waste of money and a LOT of time."
3,It's no Apple Pro,"I like the idea of wireless, and this package is cheaper than the Apple Pro keyboard and mouse. But while it's certainly serviceable, it's not the quality I expected. The keys are a little mushy, and the response is slow. The main drawback is its size. The thing is way too big. I may return it."
4,Good Features With Poor Software,"Nice white color-hard to find. Software is poor. Updates hard to find.This is an old model, but works OK."
2,Poor quality,"I bought one of these and was surprised at the problems I had, as I have not experienced issues with Logitech products before.After about two weeks, the left mouse button began to degrade in performance, and lost its ""feel"". It would squeak when clicked, and the amount of travel to press it down got much smaller. The ""Enter"" key on the numeric keypad would also stick down when pressed.I returned the unit, and the replacement set would not even communicate between the keyboard or mouse and the receiver.I returned the second set, and bought a wireless MS Multimedia keyboard and mouse instead, whith which I have had no problems in 2 months now."
3,good but...,"its really good one. it can be used for both pc and notepads. but multimedia keys were functioning wrongly. that means for messanger button, it invokes mute options. most of multimedia button's functionality were shuffeled.. other than that it is really fine."
5,Perfect for Mac OSX!,"I recently recieved the Cordless Navigator Duo as a ""get well soon"" gift of sorts for recently having had serious knee surgery. My computer illiterate dad was able to set the keyboard and mouse up for me in minutes and as long as you install the included software, everything works flawlessly. you can easily program buttons to open up frequently used applications, web sites or folders, and it is perfect for my music collection. It can switch tracks, adjust volume, pause, play, stop, and eject a cd all without opening your media application (iTunes, WinAmp, etc.) The keyboard is extremely quiet and comfortable and the mouse works great on any surface. I love this thing.So believe me this product works PERFECTLY on a mac running OSX."
5,This is an excellent Keyboard And Mouse,I purchased this from Amazon and I got this in two days with free shipping. Just plugged in receiver to USB port and insert the batteries. Amazingly both keyboard and Mouse started working without any settings or restart of my computer. Howerver you need to install provided software if you want to use complete multimedia keys. I am using this for my Compaq presario laptop. All keys are working fine after I install the included softwre. Great package and great deal from Amazon.
2,A pox on the cordless mouse!,"Just in the last 30 seconds, the mouse has skipped, paused, and jumped about 3 times. It is incredibly annoying. I used a Logitech cordless mouse (a portable one made for notebooks) before, and loved it, but this one is driving me crazy. (It may be that I have to move the 'station' closer to the mouse, but it's only now at the foot of the desk.)The keyboard is nothing special. The keyboard of my IBM laptop is more comfortable, though I think the plethora of ""action"" buttons on the top is useful. Unfortunately, the Internet access buttons do not work with the Mozilla Firefox browser."
3,"A good track from Kate Ryan, but not her best.","This is a pretty good track from Kate Ryan, but her other tracks (Scream For More, Deschentee, and UR My Love) are much better. This does h ave some good remixes, my favorite being Hiver & Hammer. The price is good too =)"
2,Alternate Title Suggestion: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About My Wife's Menopause,"Maybe it's because I'm a dog person. Maybe it's because it was tedious and uncomfortable hearing about the wife's world's-worst-menopause problems every other page or so. Maybe it's because the book seemed a little too long. Not sure exactly why I couldn't get into this one. I checked out the book because I was jealous frankly - what a dream, to spend a year in Europe, and they got to do it - and wanted to see how they capusulized it in the pages of the book. I was disappointed I guess. I also was a little put off by the fact that they chose to cart their very elderly cat around with them, it seemed such an unnecessary stress on everyone; I have a 14 year old dog and I never would have put her through those kinds of travel trials. I was pleasantly surprised that the husband was able to communicate in French and made the effort, good for him."
2,"too much whining, not enough travel related writing","The author of this book spends far too many pages whining about his depression, his wife's menopause and German hotel desk clerks. I didn't find either of the main characters likeable at all, and the cat dies. Did they really THINK the elderly cat would like being schelped around Europe for a year?!"
3,"Okay grinder, very poor stuffer","I bought this grinder so I could have a grinder and sausage stuffer as an 'all in one' unit. I bought pork and ground it up, ready to add seasoning and then stuff into the sausage casing. The rating of 176lb per hour is optimistic, but it does work okay.I reconfigured the auger for sausage stuffing, but the poor directions left me wondering if it was set up right. There is no front end support for the auger shaft, so before you put meat in the input, the auger grinds on the housing, metal on metal.I stuffed several feet of 19mm casing, but it took much longer and more work than I had expected. A lot of meat is left in the auger assy. and there is no way to get it into the casing.So...it grinds fine, bad directions, poor at stuffing a 19mm casing. I bought a vertical stuffer and it works wonderfully. If you buy this unit, buy it as a grinder only."
4,"Fast, durable","The product does a nice job. As another reviewer mentioned, it is easy to put the cutting blade in backwards. The drawing in the instructions looks like it was made by a 3-year old and is not very clear. So make sure the blade faces the grinder plate. Also, even after drying and coating with oil some metal parts will still turn the oil black.The machine feels heavy duty, very durable and powerful. I am happy with the performance so far. I just ground up 5.25 pounds of pork in just under 5 minutes using the coarse plate with the larger holes. The other plates with smaller holes will take more time. Still a good job I think. Also, the shipping charge is high and tax was charged even though the company does not have a POS in my home state."
4,Northern Tool Meat Grinder,"Very good piece of equipment. Does an excellent job of grinding meats with a minimum of effort. The machine is relatively quiet considering the job its meant to do. Works best if the meat you intend to grind is slightly frozen. The additional cutter plates is a great extra value. ShortFall: Would be super great if extra cutter blades would be included to match the extra cutter plates. This is because the cutter blades conform to the cutter plates being used over time. In other words, each cutter blade and cutter plate should be a matched set."
1,DO NOT BE CONFUSED,"There is an item IDENTICAL to this one, but made by Oriental Company called TASIN. If you are expecting commercial quality, and most powerful electric meat grinder, go with TASIN. It has 1200 WATT MOTOR POWER. It will grind just about everything from deer, elk, whole chicken with bones and nuts. TS-108 SUPER GRINDER is what you want."
1,Not Happy!,"When I got my, much anticipated, meat grinder I could hardly wait to unpack and get ready to grind meat. Once I started going through the packing list I noticed the ""Pusher"" was missing. Well mistakes happen, but surprises were not over yet. Once I cleaned everything, cut my meat, and ready to save money I found that something was binding the motor. After reassembling the unit 3 times and each time the breaker kicked out, I tried running the unit without anything connected and got the same results.Not very good quality control. So now I boxing it up, sending it back, getting my money refunded, and I will now by something made any place other than China."
1,Northern Tool electric meat grinder,I purchased this grinder to make hamburger for my dog out of whole meat.I cut off all the fat and cut it thin and clean. Nevertheless the gristle thatis in all meat clogs the holes in the strainer and the meat won't come through.I have to open it up and clean it off at least 3 times for a pound of meat.This is not good. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am not happy withthis product.
5,"Powerful, compelling and corruscating work","This is one of the most important volumes of poetry in our time. I have been dazzled by the bravery and the intimacy of this great poetry. Like a contemporary Dostoevsky stood up against a wall for execution and even more excruciatingly pardoned, for a time, this young woman has created a poetry pof survival and p[ersistence and pluck that puts her elders to shame. A true shame. Who has written, iun the last decade, any poem as powerful as her Jade or as Poem for a Poem? She has taken the hedonism and whimsy of the New York Schpool and strangled it severely. Though shre has suffered, she has created, like Ginsberg, a poetry of comradely love and blistering vision. She has given us a book of this era, fresh as a snapshot, elongated as a dirge. We all look forward to her continued courage; we look forward to her next book, like a letter that we hardly deserve. This is a poet who has dealt with an infinite burden, with the virogorous wit of a revolutionary."
2,not very good...,"i've read many outlines in this bible outline vien. read, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by henrietta mears."
4,Solid introduction to the basic strategies of Go,"I have checked out several books from the library on Go, and I found this to be one of the better introductory level books. It's not as instructive to the complete novice as Janice Kim's ""Learn to Play Go: Volume 1"" (an excellent series btw), but it does cover more material. This book goes over some concepts and then has problems that test you on what you've just read about. It covers a wide range of material from basic moves like nets and ladders up to an example of a complete profesional learning game on a 19X19 board."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be a disappointment. I'm not sure who the intended audience is. As a complete beginner, I found too many early, basic topics included here to be confusing and poorly explained. This is the sort of book for those who wish they could be reading a math textbook. There's the same concise, almost cryptic style I recall from my months spent hating calculus. Perhaps a better title would be, ""Teach Yourself Go Because I'm Not Going to Explain the Easy Stuff."" Perhaps others feel this is a delightful read. Not me. P.S. Mr Matthews' contributions to a web site entitled ""Sensei's Library"" (look for it on Google) are much more relaxed and better written, with clearer explanations for essential concepts. I want to thank him for those writings, but not this thinned-out glossed-over frustrating tome."
5,Great for old movie buffs,Having four movies on one DVD is great for those who love old 30's and 40's movies. I have re-discovered old stories and actors I thought were long forgotten. I enjoy these 4 pack movies and will continue to buy more of them.
4,"Roman Dirge, it's not.....","and that's a good thing! I just recently discovered Gris Grimly searching on Amazon.com, and he's quickly become one of my favorite artists. His illustrations in this book are so engrossing, I love to just sit and pick out all the detail. And the little stories are very clever and funny. My only complaint is that the book wasn't long enough. I'd love to see Mr. Grimly explore more classic fairy tales and make them his own. This book is a must for any dark child."
1,NOT for children!,"This book is way too scary for kids. When I stumbled upon it I thought maybe it would be a good book to read around halloween, that was until I started to read it. Father Grim, a little creapy but okay, its Halloween right? Miss Muffet, totally scary! Her parents throw her in the cellar to die alone? WTFreak! And the pictures to go along with it are haunting. Dont let your young children read this book. I think middle school would be the earliest a child could handle tales like these. And even then, I wouldnt buy this one for the kids. It needs to be toned down, A LOT!"
3,There is no market for this camera.,"I bought this camera and regret it since returning it will cost a huge restocking cost (i didn't buy it at amazon). For the same price as this A203...you can find the 3mpix version the A303. So why does Fuji even make this A203? I'm not sure. A good price for this camera would be (One hundred ninety nine dollars).As for the camera itself, its picture quality is impressive...but the most annoying characteristic is its around 4-second delay after taking each picture. That means you cannot take pictures in rapid succession. Aside from that, it's controls are very easy to use, battery-life is excellent, and its compact size make it nice camera...but do yourself a favor and buy the A303. Might as well get 3mpix for the same price as 2mpix.Another thing about this camera is that it is one of the few that is Made in Japan. So there is no cheap Chinese or Mexican labor involved in manufacturing this camera."
3,Luke Warm,"This book at first seems like it will be filled with first person accounts of wonderful adventure and discovering ancient, lost and thought to be only legendary sites. The first chapter is brutal. Do I really need all the history of dead people of the Sahara? Perhaps scattered through the book as we visit the sites where these previous explorers met an untimely demise. We really only get about 2 chapters of actual exploring and discovery. Prorok at many times in the book saves us from the dull dreary details in many areas of exploration he deems to be not in the parameters of this book. Good job Prorok, except there's about another 150 pages you could have saved me from. Having said all of that, I came away knowing a lot more about a topic I had never read about before...the cover was intriguing even if the back cover misrepresented the book."
2,Not the manufacturer stated in the ad,"The ad for the badge says, ""by Blackinton"", but the badge sent was Rothco. The Rothco is not finished as well, and has a chintzy attachment clip, unlike the Blackinton. I ordered two Blackinton badges from Amazon, and received Rothco badges from both separate sellers. My advice is to email the seller prior to purchase, and make sure you're getting what you want. The first seller never responded to my post-purchase email, and I didn't even bother with the second. Caveat emptor..."
1,mediocre at best,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who is seriously looking into the finer points of restaurant design. Many of the chosen establishments have a very dated look to them, the photography is not up to par (so its not even good enough for the coffee table) and overall this book is a big snore. I am disappointed enough to return it, which I will be doing today. Definitely not worth the price. For a better read, try Restaurants That Work, by Martin E. Dorf."
3,Inspiration Abounds,"I truly enjoyed the pictorial nature of this book. The descriptive text is also written in a visual style. I would have liked to read more about the concept inspirations and possibly some costs and expense of the designs. i have visited some of these wonderful spaces and would also liked to have addresses to visit more ""Bars, Pubs and Cafes"" during my travels."
3,Shah Rukh Khan's part in this film is good,"I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. I bought this film because I knew he made an extended special appearance in it. I think that Shah Rukh Khan is too high quality of an actor to appear in this film. To me, he was the only good thing about the film. Sushmita Sen is beautiful and very talented. She did a great job in Main Hoon Na. This film just didn't appeal to me."
5,10 minutes that shook my life.,"once youve read one story you have got to read them all, they go into detail about john and paul and its just great. theres stories for just about everything.the pictures are clear and amazing, most, if not all of them you cannot find on the internet, this book is gigantic, almost the size of text books, which makes the pictures even more amazing.you are not a beatles fan unless you have this book."
5,Top Mops,"Yes you have heard the stories before, and you have even seen most of the picutres, but the way they have been put together still makes it worth while. It's like having all MOJO articles on the fabs in one book, and hey! maybe it's exactly what it is? They should have called it Chronology!"
3,"Solid, but Limited","This is a great book IF you are already aware of all the existing strengths and weaknesses of the civilizations that are not new to the Conquerors Edition. In other words, you better have the previous book if you want complete knowledge of all the civilizations.That having been said, the depth of the analysis for each of the new civilizations is impressive. It tells you everything you need to do to use a civilization's strengths to their best advantage.There is very little general training here, and so is not the right book for 'beginners'. I makes a fine addition to the knowledge base of an already experienced user who needs depth on what's NEW in this edition."
1,BEWARE,"FUJI FILM HAS EXTEREMLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEIR CAMERAS ARE ONLY BUILT TO LAST THE LIFE OF THE 1 YEAR WARRANTY.I've had 3 Fuji camera now because they keep breaking. The last time my camera broke was a month past the warranty expiration date. Out of frustration, I wrote a letter to Fuji and the store I bought my camera at to complain and I didn't get any response from Fuji... I know they got the letter, because I got a response from the store that I purchased it from and they agreed to pay for the repairs.And, I'm not the only one, unfortunately you don't hear about this stuff until AFTER it already happened."
2,"Nice price, but not-so-nice pictures","I bought this camera because of the price, but when comparing the pictures with my 1.3 MP Sony I relized the Sony took much better pictures (even though the Sony has no zoom and has a lower resolution.)My first problem with the camera was the aforementioned low light problem. My apartment gets plenty of light, but the picture still came out extremely grainy. Also, due to the positioning of the flash so close to the lens, any dust floating in the air shows up as large white spots on the picture.The focus also didn't quite seem to focus as well as it should have. I took the camera back after having it for 3 hours.Just remember: you get what you pay for."
3,Its gettin worse each time!,"Fuji 2600 sold very good in 2001 because it was cheap & solid camera (with below average build quality). They removed some features and downgraded its screen & lens speed to make 2650 in 2002 even cheaper. Come 2003 they have added video-out and futher downgraded it, made it uglier and zero innovation.Basically its gotten thicker (well above 2 inches), even worse lens, poor night capability, grainy LCD, cheapo plastic body, expensive xD cards and average build quality. The picture quality in daylight is very good though. Battery life and user interface are also good.Meanwhile cameras from Canon, Sony, Nikon and other companies have improved a lot, added many features and have gotten cheaper. Right now Canon A60/A70 is much better option.Ofcourse first time users (who never had a digital camera before) will give it 5 stars and will be very happy."
3,dont buy cheap model,only lasted a year the switch used to toggle between camera and review broke and i take care of my stuff!dont buy any fuji!
4,Pretty decent for an inexpensive camera!,"This camera works great! Indoors works well and if it seems a little dark I lighten the pictures with my computer. I think people that don't like the camera haven't thought of using the other technologies they have to make the best of what they have. The lens has not come out for me before because I didn't realize my batteries were low. I have found that buying the batteries made specifically for digital cameras work the best and last the longest. Rechargeables don't work very well or as long on this camera. I have found if I pay a little more money on the batteries everything else works great. If you want professional pictures then buy a 500.00 camera. If you want to just take everyday pictures.... well, this is a great camera and more than I expected from it. I think some people want a miracle camera that does everything for them without sacrificing cost... As for me I think it's really a great camera especially for the cost."
5,Even I get great pictures,"This camera is great for beginners and those of us who have a fear of anything digital. I'm technically impared and thought I'd have trouble with digital cameras. With the A205 I didn't. It is intuitive to operate. The price was right. The controls are easy to find and operate.The picture quality is good enough for my needs (snapshots of family and vacations) and its easy to operate. I can play with cropping, titles and editing. Batteries drain pretty quickly, but from what I've heard this is normal. Would I buy it again? YES."
4,durable starter digital camera,"We got this camera as a Christmas gift two years ago or so. It has lasted very nicely, which is more than you can say for most electronic gadgets nowadays. I am passing it on to my spouse as I have just gotten a newer camera. How often can you say that about an electronic toy? I totally recommend this as a first or spare digital camera."
3,mixed emotions,"This camera takes quite nice pictures under the proper environment and settings. If one is outdoors with lots of light or if one uses the flash with the LCD turned off, then the pictures produced usually turn out very well. However, if one is indoors and uses the LCD to compose the shot, then pictures can get blurry. What seems to happen in this case is that once one gets a focus lock on the subject, if the subject moves after the focus lock is registered, the photos end up blurry. To avoid this is to turn off the LCD and rely on the viewfinder. Pictures end up clearer this way, however, that way the way one sees the image appear in the viewfinder isn't a true representation of the image like it would be if composed by the LCD screen."
3,I wouldn't recommend this camera,"I received this camera last year as a 13th birthday present. It worked great for about 4 months. But then I noticed that it was gradually giving me less and less pictures that I was able to take. I recently took a trip to Utah and it only alowed me to take 10 pictures when I should've been able to take 30. Last week it wouldn't let me take any pictures because it said my memory card was full but I didn't have any pictures on it. Yesterday I turned it on to see if by some miracle, it worked but it didn't work and became even worse. Now it won't close and I can't get the LCD screen to work.I defitently wouldn't recommend this camera for two reasons:1) The size: I found it very inconvenient.2) It broke very easily for me and now I can't take any pictures."
4,Good Camera,"I bought this camera about 2 weeks ago. It's a pretty good one. Picture quality for outdoors are excellent, even it only has 2MP. But indoor pictures are not very clear. Anyway, what do you expect for a $100 DC?. I am very satisfied with it."
4,great little camera,"its a great little camera, specially for the price. i use it as my position in my college student government to keep track of my class's 4 years. it has the basic uses. its not as great as the few hundred dollar digital camera my parents have (which has a million more features) but if u want an easy point and shoot w/ great pictures and easy to use features this is definitely a great camera to get for any age."
