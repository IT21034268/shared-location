4,Definetly a Good Sequel!,"What more can you expect from a sequel? Rarely do they ever compare to the first book, but this one definetly comes close!"
2,I was very disapointed. I expected more .,"After reading Angela's Ashes, which was great, I wanted to like Frank McCort's second offering but I could not. I was not impressed by his simpering self loathing...I could not even conjure sympathy, merely pity. A pathetic attempt at best, sorry Frank."
5,Another McCourt Masterpiece,"From the moment I picked up this book, I was mesmerized. This man is a brilliant writer - honest, funny, revealing - enter infinite superlatives here. No matter that I had a million things to do, this book HAD to be read. When can I meet this person that survived the hell of all hells? I got this book after I saw the movie ""Angela's Ashes,"" also an artistic marvel. Just when I think a human can not suffer any more humiliation, there is ""Tis"" to continue where ""Angela's..."" left off. I now HAVE to read A. Ashes so I can continue to revel in this amazing storytelling."
4,You are cheating yourself,"I love Frank McCourt's reading and writing style. I listened to both books on tape and would say to anyone: even if you have read the book, you must listen to Frank McCourt read his book on tape. It is awesome.I love both books and Frank McCourt has taught me and a lot of others a lesson on humility. We in the United States have had and still have it SO GOOD!"
2,The literary glue stayed in Ireland,"Naturally, I bought the hard copy book of ""Tis"" because I loved ""Angela's Ashes"". I had seen Mr. McCourt on tv interviews and wanted to follow the progression of his adventure. The second book seemed to be ""jumpy"" in content, as if he were working too hard to find material worthy of telling. Parts were compelling and yet the majority of the book forced me to continue reading in hopes of better passages ahead. Perhaps by the end of ""Tis"" I realized his new life had become as mundane as mine!"
2,Tis a Disappointment,"After thoroughly enjoying ""Angela's Ashes"" as well as the recent movie version, I was looking forward to ""Tis"". I'm now skimming the last 50 pages just to finish it already! No doubt Mr.McCourt's fans of ""Angela's Ashes"" (along with his publisher) were demanding a sequel to that bestselling memoir. Unfortunately, the author's life and experiences after he left Limerick just aren't interesting enough to warrant another book."
5,Entranced,"Frank McCourt's way of writing is entrancing. Since I had begun his life story series (Angela's Ashes) on audiocassete, I was compelled to again purchase the additional audiocassette version as well. While this version did abridge the story found in the hardback book, listening to his own oral version was the best. (this is not always the case) Even if you have already read the book, don't overlook listening to the cassette as well!"
4,Good Anthology,"As a new rider I was looking for a book on the experience of riding, riders, destinations, etc. This book worked perfectly. It is a very good anthology of stories and, mostly, excerpts of other books. As in all anthologies, the entries vary in length and quality. Aside from just a few of the chapters, I enjoyed this collection very much. I do think that the editor should have given some information on the writers and on the original works from which the pieces are taken. I would have liked information on whether the original articles appeared in magazines or books and their dates of publication. I definitely recommend the book to anyone interested in reading about motorcycling."
4,A Woman Motorcyclist Writes:,"**** - I enjoyed the stories of the clubs, world travelers and riders. Each story has its own flavor lent by the people, time and place which made it alot of fun to ""ride along"". Only one detraction- Rachel Kushners story seemed but a vehicle to express anger towards her old boyfriend. Her obvious intent made it difficult to read as she took every opportunity to poke at him- not too much there about riding, ostensibly the purpose of the book. I have ridden Baja for over 10 years, and there is a lot there she failed to mention. I'd like to see Geno line up some more writers to share their thoughts and adventures, with a touch more editorial control next time. I'd buy the next one!!!"
2,"""...me, me, me"" stories written by RUBs, dabblers, & dreamers","I enjoyed a couple of the stories but the rest of them served to repeatedly remind me: these stories were written by WRITERS (I should've paid more attention to the subtitle.)...not by motorcyclists, bikers, enthusiasts, etc. If you absolutely love motorcycles then you'll likely find the stories to be trite, self-aggrandizing, and irrelevant. Most of the ""writers"" treat bikes as transient items in their respective lives...mere accessories to their inflated sense of ""coolness"" and self-importance. The book is filled with stories that follow the ""I did this, I did that, I knew him, I saw this"" model."
3,"Strong, if inconsistent, debut","Certainly not as polished as we would later come to expect from Queen albums, this is a fairly solid debut. Obviously, Freddie had a strong voice from the start, and that unmistakable tone of Brian May's guitar is certainly in evidence. The main draw here is, of course, ""Keep Yourself Alive."" There are other good early songs here as well, such as ""Doing Alright,"" ""Liar,"" and ""Great King Rat."" Their material and execution would certainly get stronger and continue to evolve, but this is certainly not a bad first album by any means. It's just a little rougher around the edges than later releases."
5,Good as any Rock group's 1st album,"The first song I remember hearing from this album was ""Liar"". I ended up buying it on 8 track way back in '74 and heard lots of other songs on it that sounded great. This is my favorite Queen album. As their sound evolved, they became extremely popular but I liked their style at the beginning much more. ""Keep Yourself Alive"", ""Doing All Right"", ""Great King Rat"", ""The Night Comes Down"", ""Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll"" are all songs that are energetic. ""Liar"" has an incredible ending that leaves you spellbound. There aren't many albums that went with the time as well as this one and it still sounds good today. When it came out Queen was a relatively unknown band. If you like the later Queen I think you will like this but maybe not the other way around."
5,Queen CD,The key here is that I'm 64 and my nephew is 26. Getting him a Christmas present with an act we both are familiar is very rewarding. The CD came to my nephew's parents well in time for him to get it as a Christmas present.
4,Harder,"Queens first album was quite a bit different then thier usual 70s material. Freddie Mercury only plays piano on a few songs and the album is more harder edged, aggressive and less poppy then the albums to come. That might explain why it did not do so well when it was first released but this album does properly introduce a Prog Rock sensiblility (always with the band) in Great King Rat and My Fairy Queen and hosts arguably Queens first instrumental Seven Seas Of Rhye later rerecorded with lyrics."
5,"A great, consistent debut album","Queen's first album starts the band's catalog off on the right track. Very good songs and very consistent -- it's an album I can play from beginning to end without wanting to skip a track. I haven't actually sat down and rated all of their albums, but I'd guess that this would probably be in my top 5. Recommended."
3,LIAR!!,"Not a great Queen album, but it definitely has some excellent tracks. The best song on this album is Liar, which features some great guitar work. Yeah, some of the lyrics are repeated, but that's okay. Keep Yourself Alive is another great track with strong guitar work. The remix version of Liar is worthless, IMO.This album is about 3-3.5 out of 5 stars. Good debut album for a great rock band."
2,"""Jesus"" worst song ever???","I am a HUGE Queen fan, know that right off. However, if it weren't for Keep Yourself Alive, Doin' Alright, The Night Comes Down, I wouldn't even own this. This is on a par with Hot Space, in my opinion. My Fairy King (come oooon, Freddie!), Son and Daughter, Great King Rat (cool title, corny lyrics--AND I LIKE CORNY LYRICS!!), and perhaps the WORST SONG EVER RECORDED IN MODERN HISTORY, Jesus (with the exception of Starship's ""We Built This City"").They got better with QUEEN II (thank the good lord!), peaked with A Night At The Opera and News Of The World, attained global domination with The Game, lost all credibility with Hot Space, went all new-wavey with The Works, then regained my respect with Innuendo (especially the fabulous cover art), then Freddie died and it was...over.But there are always their albums to keep me company. Just not Queen I."
4,Stunning Debut,"This disk was a showcase of the magnificance of future Queen productions. Each member contributes lyrically and musically to the selection, and the vocals are perfect harmonies. Brian May's guitar layers sound almost like syntesizers, prompting the liner notes (and on subsequent releases)""No Syths"". The songwriting moods change throughout, including the May penned hit ""Keep Yourself Alive"" and the dramatic moods of Mercury's ""Liar"", which begins to showcase his ability to draw from diverse sections and construct a song that works. I particularly like ""The Night Comes Down"", appreciating the mood changes, the flaminco guitar influenced part that starts the song, and the actual chord structure that plays upon a D variation. Great stuff, but not necessarily their best work."
4,A glimpse of the beginnings....,"As a first album, this one is better than some, worse than others. If you're a die-hard Queen fan, you can't skip this one. They're a bit unpolished here but you get a fresh glimpse into the multi-part harmonies they would become famous for later on, ""My Fairy King"" especially (one of my favorite tracks on the album). You won't find any unforgettable chart toppers here, no ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or ""Another One Bites the Dust"" but if you like other classic Queen music, I think you'll find you like this album as well. There's a good mix of beats and styles. If you're not a Queen fan, you probably should give this a miss (though that would be a shame)."
3,1st is best !,"This is like the 6th time I have bought this collection of songs!Bought the record, wore it out! Bought it again, then they came out with 8 tracks, but that sucked, then cassettes hit the market (with Dolby noise reduction), that was the best thing since Chia pets !By the way Cassettes still sound great! Anyway, CD's rolled in and bought it on CD. Now there coming ouy with revamped music so, I bought this CD and this really rocks!!! The Keep Yourself Alive retake will just Blow you away, and with the remix of Liar, makes this A 5 and1/2 star pile of music to rock with!A MUST HAVE CD!!!"
3,I rode a million miles,"This, of course, was the first album by Queen. Unlike all of their subsequent albums, this one had no hit songs. The version of ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" is not the hit version, but rather an earlier instrumental version. The album is good, but leans a bit too much towards prog rock for my taste. ""Keep Yourself Alive"" is the best song here, but there are some other good ones. As for the bonus tracks, ""Mad the Swine"" is a previously unreleased song from the same recording sessions. There is an undated different version of ""Keep Yourself Alive"". And there is a useless remix of ""Liar"" that hardly sounds different from the normal version. Queen fans will want to get this CD, along with all their other CDs."
2,"Footlocker, But Not Quite","This item is not like what being sold years ago. Only one key is shipped instead of the normal 2 keys that are provided for door locks, padlocks, motor vehicles, etc. A cheap plastic lock is used instead of the older metal-style locks; so, why need a key at this point. It has 2 wheels built in to the bottom. Wheels may work for some suitcases but will they hold up well for the heavier load that a footlocker would normally hold for going to college. The item is made of a material that is not as strong as the older styles. There should really be a good handle on each side of the footlocker for carrying purposes instead of just one on the non-wheel side. I know after one year of use, I'll either have repairs to do or replace it with another one. This is one of the things where older ideas beat out newer ideas."
2,Beat Beast,"I'm a big fan of sea monster movies, and this one does have its entertaining moments. However, it's also a terrible film. Characters are, of course, two-dimensional, the dialogue is embarrassing, and it just never picks up any steam. We also get alternating shots of a rubbery tentacle flopping around on the decks of boats and the shabby-looking CGI monster the tentacles are attached to. I have the same problem with this movie that I have with all of the ""Maneater"" series movies I've seen so far: Where's the violence and gore? When you plug your movie with a DVD box that depicts creatures, animals, people, etc. slathered in blood, I expect to see some darn blood! Please, please, if you're a filmmaker and you're out there, and you're going to make a horror movie, please don't skimp on the grue! It's what we want! Don't you know that?!"
3,This seems like the beginning of a good story,"I have enjoyed some of Linda Hill's other books, but Class Reunion seemed as if the story and characters were being rushed through. The reader doesn't have time to get to know anyone before the story is over. Ms. Hill would be well advised to use this book as a springboard and 'FINISH' this novel. The characters and the plot has lots and lots of potential. It just needs to be developed."
3,not as good as 'never say never',"I just read this book after I'd read Never Say Never, and was somewhat disappointed. This book didn't have nearly the relationship or character development that I admired in other book. However, it was sweet and I understand the concept that something developed during a reunion."
2,Disappointed Anticipation,I awaited eagerly this story from talented writer Linda Hill. The story was slow and the characters developed into beings not predictable from the kinds of persons initially presented.
5,A delightful take on going home again,"Linda Hill has a sweet, almost retiring style that tells a story without histrionics and improbable actions. She draws a character with care and lets the reader come along as the characters grows and copes. Class Reunion is about facing the past before you've really had a chance to cope with it. At times the story had me laughing out loud and many times I thought, ""That is so true."" Sometimes, a book like this is just what I need."
2,Just simply another edition of running to the top,"This book deals very little with special concerns of coaching young athletes. There are a few chapters about communicating with young athletes and a few schedules (nothing special) for runners of different ages. But most of the content is simply copied straight from Running to the top. You don't probably need this book, it's much thinner than Running to the top. If you want to learn the Lydiard approach, the best thing to do is to simply buy Running to the top."
2,I sent it back,I'm sorry but I couldn't find this book useful. The author told many stories from his coaching experience with these star athletes but the information I got could have been faxed to me on a sheet of paper with bullet points. I didn't think that it was well written either.
4,AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING REFERENCE TOOL,"Also available in CD-ROM, this all-in-one resource is an authoritative reference which many scientists and learners can count on. Since its first appearance some eighty years ago, this dictionary has established itself as the ultimate tool of choice for researchers.Its extensive coverage of chemicals and pharmaceuticals is hard to rival. Users of this dictionary appreciate its concise definition of both terms and phenomena. Anybody who seeks a solid all-encompassing chemical lexicon will get the ultimate satisfaction here. Its 1300 pages are filled with the most up-to-date definitions.The only sour point, though, is that its price is on the high side. Still, it is not a bad investment."
3,Not compatible with Brother MFC210C,"I bought these because in the description it said compatible with MFC210C. Well, its not. Its not even the right shape of cartridge. Other than the fact that it was the wrong product the cartridges look genuine. If your printer takes these cartridges i recommend them."
1,bad ink,The ink did not work for tbe. Brother all in one I will buy brother brand name what I bought does not work.
1,Damaged,"Do not buy this product. I ordered this and it was shipped to me super fast. This product has the shape of the cartridge that goes into the printer, but the labels are not the same. Each color is securely enclosed in a plastic airtight sleeve which is handy. I say that because mine were leaking and had ink on the inside. I would never open those and try to clean off the ink and use them. I don't think that happened in shipping. I think they mailed me a defective product. It was thrown in the trash. I was going to try to get do an exchange.....I was not given that option. They mail defective product and then one is unable to exchange it for cartridges that aren't damaged. Avoid ordering this product. It is defective!!!"
3,not quite the same as the originals,"I was very pleased with the price and the discounted shipping. The fit was not quite the same as the originals and the cleaning process seemed to take a bit longer, but the end result was good. My experience has been that no cartridges last as long as they promise so I will have to wait and see."
5,GREAT PRICES,I dread the time when I need new ink - but I found this company and was sooo hapy with thier prices - ABOUT 20.00 less then if I went to local chain - THANKS YOU
1,did not fit my mini ipod,I believe it is a higher capacity that the original battery. It is a tiny bit biggger than the original battery. In my case the tiny bit bigger prevented it from fitting.
1,Does not fit iPod mini,"Don't buy this fake replacement battery. The package says it is for the iPod mini, but it's about twice the size of the original."
4,Excellent debut,"In terms of production values, Nurse is almost as much an opposite to the following masterpiece ""Troublegum"" as is their cathartic ""Suicide Pact - You First"". The difference is that during ""Suicide Pact..."", the sound was left brutal and unaccessible on purpose, while as with ""Nurse"", they sound was left thin by circumstances (lack of money being one, perhaps?). All in all, this thin, clunky and fuzzy sound sometimes fits the music almost perfecdtly. at least it brings a certain freshness to the music, something taht lacks from some of their ""more produced"" albums like ""Infernal Love"" or ""Shameless"". This is not your commercially succesful indie-metal-anthem Therapy? of the ""Troublegum""-era, nor is it the goth-driven experimentalist band we learned to love/loathe/tolerate with ""Infernal Love"". Nurse is full of uncompromising and inventive rock songs, less melodic and less straight-forward than with the following album, but nevertheless brilliant."
4,Works pretty well,This wrap works pretty well and was more than enough length to do the header on my yamaha dual sport. I would recommend using gloves when installing as it was messier than expected and who knows what this thing is made of so that it doesn't burn. I went with stainless hose clamps to secure the two ends and did not spray it with whatever spray the manufacturer recommends. I'm hoping the dark color keeps it from looking too dirty in the future. This stuff makes it tolerable to ride with shorts on - before this my leg was feeling pretty cooked after even a short ride around town.
3,"Does the job, but it stinks!","The material is pretty easy to stretch and manipulate. I think the 1.5"" version would have been a better bang for the buck. It does the job of keeping the heat down well. The smell that it creates initially is kind of obnoxious. I've run it on my motorcycle for a couple of weeks now and can still smell it when I'm sitting in traffic. Hoping it goes away soon."
5,For all ages,We played this game without the board and with no kids around. Everyone still had a hoot. There were some types of questions that were a little too easy (find the micket mouse ears in this scene) but it had enough tough questions to stump even the most avid Disney watchers.
3,For the thrill with out to much thought,"I have read two books from this series and neither were to impressive. This books main charactor was charming and interesting and getting introduced to her psychic ability of touching an object of a missing person/child and then entering into the thoughts of that person is quite a well read UNTIL about half way through when that darn plot gets in the way. This book is rightfully written for the young adult. I like reading young adult for easy reading which this book provided but the problem was that the plot had a twist (farely obvious one) that made a decent but very obvious story into a bareable one. The cuteness factor is pretty high, but at the same time it doesn't even go to far indepth in any detail that really gives a book some weight."
2,Not very good...,I found it boring and uninteresting and gave it away shortly after buying it. Same with the cards.
4,Low sodium High flavor,flavorful beef stock base very tasty! This works very well in my soups and for adding just a bit of depth to meat dishes. Very condensed so you only need a tiny bit at a time. No off flavor like you find sometimes in low sodium products.
4,"Good so far, but what it its shelf life?","I like it so far but am insecure about how long it will last once opened. I'm keeping it refrigerated, of course, but I cannot find an expiration date or ""use by"" date anywhere."
1,"""Beef""(?) base","The service from the company was very good. The product was terrible. It didnt' smell like ""beef"" base and sure as heck didn't taste anything like ""beef"" base. In fact, it tasted terrible. Not bland (it is the low sodium version), just bad. The lower sodium version of Better Than Boullion, unfortunately, has more sodium than this one but it tastes SO much better. I'll have to go back to using that as this is just plain BAD."
3,calendar girl,this low budget 1947 b&w; movie does not have the best picture and soundquality but it's a light fun movie to watch. it's a period piece around1900 with good singing by kenny baker and some dance numbers. enjoy!
3,Carved or Crazy?,"I found the description on the back really interesting. Of course I want to see a woman have her face cut open by her husband! Unfortunately, it wasn't like that. This movie is about a woman who abuses her children in fits of madness and then starts kidnapping other kids years later... spooky basement, angry female black-haired ghost, but nothing really interesting. It's okay but it's not wonderful, you can live without seeing it."
5,Carved is as Carved does...,"Excellent, suspenseful scary movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat and make me scream several times *and* yell at the screen. The pacing was great, and the story itself is good enough that it could have been a happy film and still be awesome (but I like horror better!) Nuanced performances by the actors, including the kids. I wasn't expecting the kids to be so good, but it's great that they are considering the roles they play.If you like edge-of-your-seat movies and twists and turns, buy it! You won't be sorry! :^)"
2,mediocre horror at best,"this was just ....ok.. nothing special. I have seen much better j-horror...at best this is only worth a rental...want to rent a good one get ""Shutter""....now that one could put this to shame...."
2,The story was suck!,"I choose to buy this film because it is one of the famous urban legend once in Japan and it arouse my interest to look at this ""remake"" version.To my disappointment, it try to create another new version that the Split mouth lady is a psychotic, and then turn into a ghost.No wonder this movie had not been shown in any theratre in Hong Kong."
2,Wth is this?,i was really excited to see this movie because of the legend but this movie did not do the legend justice. There are all kinds of holes int he plot and some random characters. The characters are typical horror movie characters sitting around watching the woman kidnap and kill children. Come on!!! This was one of the worst horror movies I've seen in a long time. It gave me a good laugh with the bad makeup and mediocre plot. I only gave it two stars for effort.
1,Not what I thought,"My 3 year old daughter loves Tigger so when I saw this I thought it would br GREAT. Boy was I wrong. I thought Tigger would be bouncing all the time and if he bounces once a game it is a lot. If ""boing"" sound he makes is suppossed to go with the bouncing it doesn't. I am totally disappointed in this game and would say if you have money to spend on it spend it someplace else. Totally thumbs down on this item.Not at all worth it or what I expected."
5,Play On Big John...,"accent on the blues is a fairly funky recording. the tracks seem equally rooted in jazz and soul, but the organ has a way of making any kind of music sound a little more funky than it would without it. with some righteous help from marvin cabell and george coleman on tenor saxophones, patton lays down some mildly unstructured tunes that are different, but none-the-less pleasing. on tracks like ""freedom jazz dance"", patton hits notes that don't sound quite right. they work, but you'll know when he hits them. it's hardly a case of patton being a weak musician though, he's simply being crafty. accent on the blues borderlines on free jazz in many instances, but patton roots the arrangements and his solos enough to keep it from getting too out there. it's not the patton i would recommend starting with if you haven't heard him before, but it's a worthy addition if you have become a fan."
2,Propaganda piece,"Book came across as an extremely bias piece. When it came to sources it seemed that Khan used the same people repeatedly. It was so bad I was only able to read the first two chapters. I'm sure that Khan put a LOT of hard work into this book but the end product was not very good. However, the idea of adding a video to the book was a huge plus and I hope other biographers follow his lead on this point. That idea alone gave this book two stars!"
4,"Alwaleed: Businessman, Billionaire, Prince",Not like most biographys. Not indepth enough. Does not really explain how the deals really happened. Would like for someone else to give a go at another one.
3,Cynics galore,"Not that I care much for either Alwaleed or Riz Khan, but I suspect one of the reviewers get a kick out of puting people down. The whole attitude stinks of arrogance and public schoolboy humour.I'm guessing he had a rich daddy, was looked after by nannies and was regularly sodomised by his English teacher."
4,Tabletop Wine Opener,The easiest way to open wine. It looks good too. Great for parties and conversation. The cork pops right out.
4,Nirvana on Beatles happy pills!,"This is a real fine album. They should do well here in the U.S., knowing our appreciation for a good melody and the ever-sought-after Beatlesque flavor. And these guys are just teens, I think. Neil Finn's son, Liam, is leader here. AND: For those who wondered where that song that ended the U.S. trailer for the movie RAIN went (on Neil's RAIN soundtrack) -- that song is on this album! ""Lucy's Song."" (""I only wanna be with you..."")"
5,Alphabetchadupa is my favorite cd ever,"I bought Betchadupa's Alphabetchadupa on a vacation to New Zealand last summer. I didn't expect to enjoy it so much. I just wanted to experience some of the legendary ""New Zealand Rock"" music. But seriously, this is an awesome CD. Everyone should give it a listen!"
4,Great Workout,"Great Yoga workout - without the crazy new age music!!There's 3 different levels (beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) which helps, along with 3 different music options (and a 4th for instruction only). An added bonus after stretching they walk you through a little 5 minute meditation to wrap it up."
5,Big Sonic Heaven...,"This album is worth the $24 just for the song Duress alone. An absolute sonic monster. Mix in the ferocity of Duel and it's really all you need. If you aren't listening to it loud enough to rattle your windows, you just aren't listening."
5,The Greatest Underrated Rock of the 90's!,"This is a great CD, from the opening to the close. The songs ""Duel"" and ""Last Train to Satansville"" make the CD worth the price by themselves. The other good songs on this CD make it worth even more. It's too bad that Swervedriver is/was so underrated. They're really a great group.Get this CD, especially if you're a fan of groups like Soundgarden."
2,Picture is Not what you get,The picture of this item does not capture the carnival-clown stripe color mix that this really is. If you like Circus-Circus in Vegas this is the bench pad for you. The picture makes it look like several broad toned conservative stripes.I don't think Cher would keep this fabric. YUCK
3,"Speak up, Ken.","The extraordinary Ken Nordine narrates a story on the first track. The only problem is, the music overwhelms his voice so that we can hardly hear him most of the time. This is a problem!! Nice music though."
3,DJ Food - A Dub Plate Of Food Volume 2,"A second helping of DJ Food on A Dub Plate of Food, Volume 2. Another beatnik taste of ""Ageing Young Rebel"" from their album Kaleidoscope is always welcome; ""Cookin'"" also reappears on this EP. ""The Crow (Dub)"" maintains the slow, meditative attitude of the original, while ""Tumbleweed"" is a beatless journey through a piano and electric guitar riff wasteland. Although I would have much preferred a second course to simply leftovers, it's still quite satisfying."
3,Adequate,"We purchased this with a 14 day trip to Italy (first time) in the future, and our intent was to learn a bit of Italian before we left. The first several lessons are excellent, however, as we moved further into the lessons the examples were spoken much too quickly for novices. It would have been much better if we could have slowed the presentation down. This is a good program to get some basics down on the Italian language... but I think if you want more in-depth into the actual structure and use of Italian, a more sophisticated program is necessary. I would still recommend this program to anyone for a good initiation into some basic communication in Italian."
4,Good course,"I found it quite useful, however it provides the very basic vocabulary and then you have to purchase an extremely expensive course to continue learning."
4,great italian,The product arrived in time specified and the product works as described. I'm already learning Italian.
4,Basic Italian,Just started using this program and have two comments. The process is very slow but it provides very good verbal break down of each word so it's easy to hear and understand.
2,OK but...........,"I would have preferred to have a written text in addition to the CD. The CD's are a good example ofwhat to expect if you buy the entire course. alone, they won't help you carry on a conversationin Italy but you will be able to ask Italians how they are and if they want to eat."
2,Mixed feelings,The produce is fine and the learning method seems good -- the bad part is it is a bit of a bait and switch product -- you get 10 lessons on 5 disks for a very cheap price (less than $20.00) BUT to go on and learn more you have to buy a very EXPENSIVE follow on course (Like $250 or more). So basically this is a demo that you pay for -- I thought I was buying a course
3,Good way to hear the proper Italian accent,"This CD set is a great way to receive a simple exposure to the musicality (?) of the Italian language. The Italian language has a flow to it, like music. It is to Spanish what an Irish brogue is to English, if that helps. This CD set will not make you an expert by any stretch of the imagination. But it will get your ears and tongue accustomed to Italian, which is a good thing. I bought it and used it to get my feet wet in Italian and have since gone on to speak the language with mild fluency. It's great for the morning commute, in the car, listening to Italian. It goes at a good pace and tests your short-term memory along the way. There is no background music or sound effects, either."
4,"Italian, Basic: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur...",I liked it but I just haven't had time to learn it. I think that it is easy to use and a good tool for anyone wanting to learn Italian.
1,AF-320 NewAir Deluxe Evaporative Cooler & Air Purifier,"Unless you have a large freezer full of ice, don't waste you time or money on this PORTABLE evaporative cooler. It only cools a room down for a short period of time and only a few degrees cooler. Think about it, if you want to use it to cool your room down at night than you will have to refill it with ice about every 2 hours! I work from a home office and this cooler was also noisy and pretty annoying when talking on the phone. I returned it after using it for 2 days and lost $20 for return shipping."
2,newair deluxe evaporative cooler and & purifier,"It does cool some, but it is not very cold. If there is a way to make it colder we would love to know it, but we are regretting this purchase at this time."
5,AF-320 NewAir Deluxe Evaporative Cooler & Air Purifier,This a great little cooler. It very portable and works great for a single room. It has a nice long cord and is easy to move. It is not an air conditioner.If that is what you want..look elsewhere.
4,Good Product,Holds up well. Good price. My only nag is that the sticker does not come off until you put a torch to it. It is stuck to it very well.I use these on the trailers we build.
5,I love this album!!!!!!,"Actually, this was just to replace the original copy that I lost, which was the domestic release. This was the import digipak, which I prefer anyway.So, alls well that ends well."
2,Not Very Impressive,"I'm reluctant to give any photographer a bad review, as I'm sure they put a lot of effort into their work. However, when you publish a book and ask people to buy it, you open yourself up to criticism. And since there are so many other Colorado picture books out there, I don't think that people should spend their money on this one. Most of the photographs in this book have the look and feel of images taken by an amateur photographer. The cover photo is pretty much representative of the entire book. It's a fairly boring, trite photograph with flowers in the foreground and mountains off in the distance. There is nothing interesting about this image, and there is almost nothing interesting about this book. If you are looking for a good Colorado picture book, I recommend taking a look at my list-mania list called Best Colorado Picture Books (by clicking on my name). I hope that this list is a good resource for anyone looking to buy a Colorado photography book."
1,a waste of time and money!,"Very disappointing. This appears to be an item collected by a group of people who ""review"" the music and thoughts of Marc Bolan. If T.rex music interests to you, purchase a music release ( major/minor record label cd), a concert dvd, or even some of the Marc TV shows released on dvd and vhs. Skip this drivel altogether including the cd of the same title. I wouldn't even give this a one star rating as a Bolan fan."
2,A bit dull,"The video quality is no better than VHS. Obviously an older video was just slapped on DVD without menus or anything else.There are not enough ""erotic"" bits, and the ones that are here are too short. There's a long sequence showing a photo shoot, something I always find annoying (photographers don't seem to realize we're not interested in them).Ms. Wakana, though lovely, is not ""voluptuous"" and doesn't seem to come across all that well on video (probably the photographer's fault).In this series, I'd recommend the video of the curvaceous Haruki Mizuno. But for much better done Japanese softcore look for Maiko Kazano DVDs. Ridiculously expensive, but worth it."
5,Take this Dive before your visit to Eden or La Luna,"As an introduction to Sarah Brightman, ""Dive"" is an excellent first installment in the unofficial trilogy which continues with ""Eden"" and concludes with ""La Luna."" Fans of her operatic tunes are advised to stay away ... this is Sarah at her pop/new age best. Highlights of this vocal triumph include ""The Second Element,"" ""Johnny Wanna Live,"" ""When it Rains in America"" and the haunting power ballad ""Captain Nemo."" I get the impression that Sarah is more at home with these concept albums ... the vocal mastery of her opera and show tunes is missed, but is compensated for with her vocal power and artful arrangements. If you're already a fan of Sarah but lack this CD, it should be your next choice. If you're new to her, this is an excellent introduction to the premier female vocalist of modern times."
2,Sarah Takes a Dive!,"Well, there's not too much I can say about this album that hasn't already been written. I only ordered this CD because I really like Sarah's stuff and it was on sale, despite all the bad reviews I had read about it. So, next time I'll be sure to pay attention to the reader comments a little better next time. This is one bad album. There is this nautical theme that runs throughout the whole disc. Why? If she were always singing about the sea that would be one thing, but it's like let's just throw this album out there and see what happens. There really isn't any redeeming quality to this CD. Some guys might get a big kick out of her see-through outfit in the cover of the CD, but that sure isn't enough reason to throw money away on this one. My advice... saves a couple of bucks and buy either ""La Luna"" or ""Eden"" if you don't already have them (which you really should because they are head and shoulders better than this one)."
3,"Good Lord Sarah, Get Some Clothes On!!!!!",Pretty good three star cd except for one thing -Sarah whering a See - Through dress...!!!Of course I'm sure this would be a motive for may men to buy the cd. All I have to say to them is:PERVERTS!!!Other than that I recomend the cd with three stars!(I know she's supposed to be a mermaid or something but still...)
1,Similar to Pavarotti singing rap.,I bought this on-line & I really hate it! Sarah is a great talent but the material is pure tripe & the accompaniment is distracting & out of balance. The balance is so atrocious that anyone could be singing & it wouldn't make any difference. This album is so bad that I would never buy another album on-line unless I heard it first.
2,"Captain Nemo should have said ""No way.""","While Sarah's voice soars as usual and the musical accompaniment is often very strong, this record's inane grade school lyrics send it to the bottom of the sea. Save your money and buy ""Eden"" or The Webber Collection instead."
3,Better for your eyes than your ears,"I have long been a fan of Sarah Brightman & have always loved her music, however I cannot agree with all the rave reviews for this CD.I think the music on Dive is uninspired & not nearly up to her quality. Her voice is fine, just the selection of songs is poor.In my opinion, the best part of this CD is the photo inside of Sarah wearing her nearly-transparent golden cat-suit. So I give this CD 1 star for the music plus 2 stars for the photo."
5,The BEST Sarah Brightman CD,"I picked up this CD when it first came out, and I can't remember why. I'm glad I did. It remains one of my favorite CD's, and I keep coming back to it. It's mix of rock and great vocals, as well as the theme, is very well put together. The best track is SEVEN SEAS. Superb, moving, and beautiful. Everyone I've ever had listen to this CD has always asked ""who's that?!""."
2,It's a Dive for me !!,"I'm sorry to say that after reading others reviews here I bought this cd. I have others of Sarah Brightman's works and her voice is mature and clear. This did nothing for me. No excitement. No tingles with her voice levels as with others she has done like Eden. There was such a lack of maturity in this and the choice of songs were boring. Of course this is my own opinion but I would have to say : if it is a first time listener to Sarah...don't get this one...try another one like Eden or Surrender...or others......this does no justice to her voice, quality or range...it's just not her at all !!"
3,The music? Who cares; check out the centerfold.,"There has to be some significance in the fact that most reviewers are more captivated with the cover photographs than the actual music. As for me, this CD contains both the best and worst of this artist. Her voice is impeccable, but after listening to the PETA propaganda of ""Johnny Wanna Live"", I had to repress a gag reflex. Kinda makes me want to go beat a baby seal or two.On the other hand, ""Ship of Fools/Once in a Lifetime"" is dazzling and beautiful. On first listen I thought this selection would be perfect for a wedding-reception dance; the swirling percussive beat is infectuous, and the whispered Spanish interjections add a touch of sensual drama. Then I read the lyric sheet. Whoa! ""Wet black leather on my skin / show me the floor / lay down the law/ I need to taste you more."" Sarah, you kinky thing, you. I'm sure that's someone's idea of a perfect wedding night, but make sure the reverend leaves before you play this at the reception."
4,"Not as wonderful as I thought it would be, but still ok","I have been a fan of Brightman ever since I began listening to the Phantom of the Opera. I read the wonderful reviews Dive got online, so I thought I'd give it a try. It was NOT as good as people said. I expected the lyrics to be more profound than they were. I loved the songs 'Once In a Lifetime', 'Second Element' (it's the best on the CD!), 'Second Element II', and 'Ship of Fools'. Overall the CD was pretty good, just don't expect anything amazing--you may be disappointed."
3,Only for beginners,"I just flipped through this and thought - wow looks good. Got home and realized there are no records for any Indian Head Pennies, Barber Dimes or Barber Quarters. Don't even think about Large Cents, V Nickels, and seated dimes. A good attempt but useless for me. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Challenging Assumptions about Deconstruction,"Deconstruction and negative theology are not regularly considered together. However, Hart suggests this has more to do with the assumptions of readers of deconstruction - particularly readers of Derrida. He argues that, by the nature of deconstruction itself, it must be open to alternative readings. He goes on to demonstrate once again that philosophy and theology are not necessarily inconsistent. Hart's basic argument is that negative theology is in fact a form of deconstruction. His text is a challenging read and a refreshing ""deconstruction"" of a number of other readings of deconstruction."
4,insightful reading,"I had read Sounding many years ago & thoroughly enjoyed it. Hadn't been able to find it in print anywhere, so was glad to be able to find it for my Kindle so a friend can now read it also."
5,Good old American Made Quality,"Used this product 20 years ago as a { sent to me tool} with the x-ray company that I worked for then.Still have the original set,and because certain sizes were missing and the old set was sticking on the ratchet,decided to order the new set.Great product to use in tight spaces and do appreciate the quality and durability of an American Made product."
4,curtains...,"The curtains were just a bit more rust color than burgundy but still nice and very good quality, great item for the cost."
4,General encouragement with a challange,"This book was given to me by a home-schooling mom. I have since read it and am giving it to a young mom considering home-schooling. Though not full of detailed information about day to day function of a large home-school family, this book does address several basic questions about the ""why"" of families and home-schooling."
5,Answering the basic questions,"I picked up Vickie Farris' book on a whim and laughed and cried my way through it. Farris' very personal book touches on the subjects of curriculae and scheduling, but if that's where you're at, there are probably better, more detailed reading materials out there. This book deals with the step before that; the point where you feel maybe home schooling is for you, but you're lacking confidence that you have what it takes to do it. Farris lets you follow the path that took her to where she is, a home schooling mother with 10 kids (3 of which are now adults!). Her honesty, vulnerability, and straightforwardness is very encouraging and moved me from being terrified to being excited about home schooling our son. Couldn't have done it without her!"
3,Misleading,"The book is an interesting look into another mother's life, but she is not a ""mom just like me"". She hires a nanny, housekeeper and lawn keeper! I was looking for practical solutions to raising a large homeschooling family, hiring other people to do my job isn't an option."
1,Save your money,"If you're looking for a resourceful read for homeschooling moms, keep looking, this is NOT it. Especially the chapter on keeping our homes as well as teaching our children, Mrs. Farris' answer to that question is to hire a housekeeper as she does. If my husband were an attorney, like hers, that may be a solution, but in the real world, HS care for their homes themselves, we can't afford to have someone else do it for us. We are looking for real answers and real solutions, not just hiring someone else to do the job God gave us as wives and mothers. So if you need hard answers to keeping organized with homes and children that are HS, don't waste your money on this one."
4,Kohler faucet,Wanted an upgrade from the cheap faucets the builder put in. These have the feel and look I was expecting.
5,A one in a life book.,"This book is a great book and teach you the great power and meaning of love.That said it all because AMI show you love and of course GOD, that is the same."
5,PROYECTO: SALVAR LA TIERRA,"Que os puedo contar a aquellos que lo habeis leido que no sepais? Cuando este libro cae en las manos de alguien, una de dos, o le cambia la vida porque esta preparado para recibir la ensenianza, o no esta preparado para recibirla y lo ignora por completo, o simplemente es un ""adulto"" que no puede salir de su rol de adulto. Soy un habitante del planeta tierra que nacio en Madrid y que probablemente fije mi residencia en esa misma ciudad cuando haya decidido hacerlo. Ahora me encuentro en Inglaterra conociendo un poco de nuestro planeta. Me encantaria poder encontrar este libro en Bournemoth, donde yo vivo ahora, y difundirlo entre la gente ""maravillosa"" que he conocido por estos lares. Amor para todos. Mente lucida, corazon tierno. Me guataria contactar con gente de todos los lugares del planeta para poder hacer algo juntos algun dia."
4,obras en general de enrique barrios,"ami fue excelente,pero los demas fueron mejores por ejemplo cuentos de amor, estrellas y almas gemelas, es uno de mis favoritos... esperando con ansias nuevas aventuras a vivir, con las obras de enrique barrios..."
5,Ami: ¡Nos sorprendiste!,"¡Mágico, cautivador, profundo, sorprendente, inocente y sabio! Extrañamente nosotras tampoco podemos encontrar el libro en el comercio, está agotado en todas las librerías de Chile y hemos llegado a pensar que ha sido enviado directamente desde Ofir (por el mismísimo Ami) traducido en todos los idiomas de nuestro querido planeta Tierra. Ami: si puedes enviarnos unos ejemplares en español te lo agradeceríamos mucho. Gracias por tus palabras, una hermosa lección de amor has dejado en nuestras vidas, trataremos de ayudarte en la misión. Con cariño, María Jesús y Carola."
5,"Ami is perhaps the best book i've read, a book of Love","Ami is one great book, because in there, many truths that we ignore and are so beautiful are shown. This book may easily change your life, and you'll never see things again the same. You MUST read this book, for yourself and the Earth. You also must read its sequel: Ami returns. Remember, Love is all."
4,Incredibly dark story with beautiful artwork,"I guess I'm writing this review mostly in the hopes that Mr. Gagne will read it and put out another volume because he has started something really fascinating with Zed and I want to see where it will go. This is the kind of story that draws you in with its style, grabs you with its sudden trauma and holds you with concern for its characters. Its combination of cuteness with horror make it almost haunting. I guess the only reason why I don't give it a fifth star is that it's left its audience dangling from its cliffhanger for so long. Please, please finish the story!"
3,hard to rate,"It is very hard to rate a product when there has been no noticeable changes. Time can be the only true test of this product and until that time comes, I cannot truthfully give a genuine review."
5,"Leonard Cohen, Live in London, DVD",A wonderful DVD with great music by Leonard Cohen and a nice assortment of his songs/poems. This arrived very quickly and we are very pleased with the quality of service.
5,leonard cohen - better than ever,"Watching this video was such a great remembrance of the concert we were so fortunate to see in the beautiful Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver, Colorado. In a way it is better than seeing the real thing, because we get to watch it over and over again!."
5,Mr. Cohen at his best!,"I had the privilege of seeing Leonard Cohen live in NY Radio City Music Hall. The songs he performed were slightly different from the Live in London arrangement, but beyond that the magic is still there. The DVD itself is very well put together and the sound quality is great. This is a must for every LC fan!"
5,The best ever,"I first heard and saw the dvd on PBS, and I had to have it. It is gorgeous. I am so glad I have it. Now I can listen to it any time I want. The band and the back up singers are marvelous. They would have to be, backing a musical genius like LC. I'm just so sorry that we moved away from Philadelphia before his performance at the Academy of Music. It is a fittingly beautiful venue for LC."
4,Leonard Cohen - Live in London,"Being a Leonard Cohen fan I found this recording excellent. The sound quality was excellent, his backup band and singers superb. Leonard maybe 75 years old but he did a phenominal job. My only one complaint would be it was filmed in Blu-ray, but still over all, an excellent dvd to add to your music collection if your a Leonard fan."
5,Ever Fabulous Leonard Cohen,"LOVE IT! Absolutely a treasure to own. With this concert DVD I got soooo much more then I had expected. The music, instrumentals and impressionisms are outstandingly Leonard Cohen. Well worth the few dollars I paid for it. Better then front row seats at the actual concert!Live In London"
4,Live in London,"Leonard Cohen has always been a unique performer. Sort of an enigma in real life with a talent that cannot be denied. Live in London filmed on July 17, 2008 at the O2 Arena presents the man at his very best.Performing witha spot on nine member band and looking a very dapper 75 years young, Cohen gives a very appreciative audience a performance that served as a great retrospective of his now four decades plus career. Filmed in closeups that focus on the band and not on the audience by Edward Sanders, Cohen is in top form as he performs standards like Bird on a Wire, Everybody Knows,Hallelujah, I'm Your Man, and Closing Time. There is not one slow moment in the entire two hour and thirty nine minute performance.This is a show that was well worth waiting for and well worth purchasing. The only DVD extra is a copy of the song lyrics but really that is all that was needed."
5,Wonderful Concert,"If you are a follower of one of the greatest composer/singers of any generation, then this DVD is a must!"
5,Absolutely amazing performance,I first saw this DVD presented on a PBS station. Even though they only played about one third of this DVD a few songs at a time with fund rising in between I knew that I had to get this DVD. The next day I went to Amazon.com and bought it. This is one of the best concerts I have ever seen. Leonard's performance is absolutely riveting. The reason for this I feel is the passion that he gives to the presentation of each song. On one song he doesn't even sing it; he recites it like poetry which it is. He is accompanied with a full band and backup singers which are all amazing artists and add to the performance if that is even possible. I have watched this DVD many times now and have not yet tired of it.
5,Perfect,Fast delivery of a perfect show. Leonard Cohen has aged like fine wine. I do not care for his albums from the 70s and 80s but his performance in this DVD is outstanding.
3,great content but moderate quality,"Leonard Cohen's modesty and sincerety and the poetry and music make this worth while. The quality of the video and the lighting is generally poor and does not do justice to the quality of the performer. I would recommend that a new video be filmed at one of his shows but with the right sound, lighting and camera work for a first class DVD."
5,Recommending,Loved it! Saw part of this program on PBS and had to have it. The man with the golden voice.
5,Same old headline - I love Leonard Cohen,"I've seen most of this on YouTube so it was nice to see the entire thing, uninterrupted. He is a genius and his songs/poetry goes straight to your heart. Never had an entertainer that could do that for me."
5,Living under a rock,I guess I have been living under a rock since Leonard Cohen was new to me when I saw part of LIVE IN LONDON on PBS and immediately ordered the DVD.How could I have missed him all this time?? Well now I am an instant fan and this DVD is so good I really am at a loss for words to describe it. I knew a lot of the songs that had been done by other artists but had still missed the genius himself.The music itself is so good that it stands up to different versions by different artists but I always come back to his versions as my favorites. For example BIRD ON A WIRE was done by Johnny Cash and it seemed vintage Johnny Cash...........but Leonard gives it a whole new feeling when you see his from the heart version. GET IT!!!! I also want to order K.D. Lange's version of Hallelujah which I saw Leonard say moved him deeply.drlee
5,Amazing,"Amazing music, amazing lyrics, an amazing voice ... I had no idea songs and music such as this were part of today's ""popular"" music. The lyrics flow easily, but they are deep, and as demanding -- and rewarding -- as any poetry (which they are, of course, as are the lyrics of any song). The accompaniment, vocal and instrumental, is outstanding. All in all, a mind-opening discovery for me."
2,Huh?,"I like a few of the songs, but...really? A record deal? I would not reccommend buying this unless you really know what you are doing. Not worth the money to buy it new. Maybe not even used. His songs are pretty good but the guy can't really sing. Ray, stick to songwriting. You will do well selling your songs to singers."
1,Not what is promised.,"This item is not what is says it is. Is indicates that the bloopers are ""on the hardwood court"". Only a few involve actual events on the court. Most of the bloopers are pranks and events which took place behind the scenes. It is still somewhat funny but not what was promised."
5,Funny for kids,My 6 year old son loves this DVD - he is a huge sports fan and watched this every night before bed.
3,BETTER THAN MOST,THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE IOLO MECHANIC 6 IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL ME MECHANIC 7 BEFORE I HAVE HAD THE MECHANIC 6 FOR LESS THAN A YEAR.I FEEL THEY SHOULD UPGRADE FREE.E. FIELD
1,Terrible!,"The program doesn't do anything well. Even something simple like backing up the Registry hangs my XP system. Run any analysis, let it ""fix"" the problems and when you rerun the analysis it finds the same problems. Norton Internet Security flags several of its options as ""High Risk"". Even if it actually fixed anything, it doesn't tell you what it's going to change before it does it and the logs show nothing. Stay away!"
1,This Program is Garbage,"The only thing worse than System Mechanic 6 is iolo's technical support. Don't inflict this plague upon your computer. Had I read Amazon's reviews first, I'd have stayed away from this train wreck."
1,Iolo tech support OUT OF CONTROL,"Installed System Mechanic 7 on Pentium 4 laptop running Windows XP and it crashed the machine to the point the only way to bring it back to life was to system-restore to the nearest pre-Iolo restore point. Managed to capture the error codes and emailed them to Iolo tech support. Unable to elicit a response from tech support other than automated emails (half of which try to sell me the product all over again). Left voicemails with customer support and even with the corporate receptionist. No response. No response to request for refund.OBVIOUSLY, MANAGEMENT IS UNWILLING TO STAFF TECH SUPPORT WITH ANYTHING LIKE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE LIVE PEOPLE ADDRESS REAL ISSUES. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
1,Screws Up Your Computer,Screwed up my wireless and my scanner. Still cannot get my wireless to work again after months of trying. Made no difference in computer performance. Did not fix any problems. File cleanup takes over 12 hours with only modest results. Don't buy it!
1,If you like to have some control over your PC ...,"This is not the product! System Mechanic 6 attempts to automate maintenance decisions, but the user is unable to tell what decisions / changes are made. When BAD changes are made, it is practically impossible to diagnose what went wrong. In my experience, it makes MANY bad decisions and the only recourse is to reverse the changes made. Sometimes this is not easy and it takes some clever manipulation at boot time, etc. This software is not recommended."
1,A terrible program,"After this product caused chkdsk to run so many times at reboot, I was glad to get this thing off my PC. Also, it does not perform according to options selected, removing items as it sees fit, and it does not propose individual actions before performing them, even though it claims it will. It does not log what changes it does make, and it seems to make no difference at all in my PC's performance. It did free up memory, but it took so long to do it, it wasn't practical anyway. If I could give 5 stars for junk, this product would earn them, rating first in lack of utility; first in destructive performance; first in lack of user control, first in lack of documentation; and first in cost-uselessness."
1,System Mechanic 6 Not good!,"System Mechanic 6 not only hangs up its self, but hangs up my computer when it tries some ""analses"". Also the company does not answer questions about problems )there are many). Sorry I spent money on this product. Would like to know what to do."
1,"Same problems, different version","This will not ""fix"" anything, especially if you have anti-virus software installed. Your computer will lock up if you run this program, as it has done in previous versions of the software. DON'T BUY!!!!"
1,What Happened?,"I have been a very happy user of System Mechanic since version 3. It kept getting better and better with every version, until this version came out. I have never seen a such an easy to use and useful program take as large of a nose dive from one version to the next until I saw System Mechanic go from version 5 to 6. It is literally a miserable mess. Tell me SM6 creators, why is it the program wants to connect to the internet SEVERAL times a day? Why have you added so many background processes to my start up that I have no option of turning off in SM settings? Did you know you considered my nvidia video card software as malware and disabled it? (...) I miss the ease of the earlier versions."
3,"It has a nice look, but is too thin.","This jacket fits great, and looks great, but is just a bit too thin. I love the raspberry jam color! I would like the jacket better if it was completely lined. It will keep me dry, and prevent the wind from coming through, but will not add warmth. It is also noisy and the nylon makes a swooshing sound when my arms rub the body of the jacket. It was almost worth the price I paid. If I had paid more, I would have been really disappointed."
4,Great Jacket but Noisy,The jacket is comfortable and a great rain jacket. It's a little stiff and noisy when I move. I'm hoping it softens a bit with use.
1,Disappointing for active use,"I've had this for over a year now. I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product. It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry. That's what happens in dry weather. The fit is comfortable and it's otherwise conveniently designed. The fabric in white is quite see-through. Later I purchased Turfer's ""Womens's Light Weight Endurance Jacket"" for $14.95 and that's been the perfect windbreaker. It's now up to $19.95 and I'm ordering another color."
4,Not for the weak,"I can barely keep up with her..well, I can't really. I just hang on, trying to do as much of the (pretty advanced) moves as possible. No more than once a week for me and Kristin."
2,A little too chipper for me.,"The workout is pretty good, however, a little fast paced at times. Most of the time I pass on this workout because the instructor seems unrealistically happy. Frankly, I find it a bit annoying. Yoga is something that I do to relax and get in touch with my mind and body. In this workout I find it hard to do that because the instructors' personality is intrusive."
3,Good workout,"The video provides a great power yoga workout as the positions change at a very fast pace, but it's not for a beginner. The routines are VERY challenging; I sprained a toe trying to get into one of the balancing poses. There isn't sufficient instruction either about proper alignment, position, etc. There is not introduction and only one routine. The only transition between ""easy"" and ""hard"" is Kristin saying, ""if you're moving on with me""."
4,Great Paced Yoga Video,"I love how quickly Kristin moves through the poses. I always feel great after I do it, but I haven't yet made it past the first 25 minute segment because it's HARD and I'm building up my strength still."
4,Nice DVD,This is a great power yoga session. Kristin does an excellent job. The routine flows well and has a good amount of variety. Beginners could do this routine and it would stretch them (pun). Intermediates will find this a great maintenance routine. The only criticism that could be said of the program is that it is a little light on specific backbends. I usually throw a few extra in at the end. Overall a good addition to your yoga DVD collection and well worth the price.
4,Krisin is great-power yoga is a great change of pace...,"I really enjoyed the faster pace of this video. It took me a couple of times to get it down so I could focus on the moves but after that, it became a favorite for days of active rest. Her cuing is excellent. There is not a lot of the yogatalk either, if that is something that gets under your skin. I liked the music as well!"
5,Kristin McGee's workouts,I have never been able to stick with a DVD but this one is great! Kristin is awesome and keeps you focused on the workout. I haven't got bored with this one yet!
3,"Good, not amazing","This was a good workout, and some pose series did kill my buns and thighs for a bit, and all the downward dogs made my shoulders tired after a while. But it could have been harder; I was looking for something a bit tougher."
3,More advanced than expected,"Having read other reviews for Kristin's Yoga CD, I purchased it thinking there would be something for everyone, from beginner on up. I immediately felt that it was too advanced for me. I wouldn't recommend this Yoga DVD unless you've been doing it for awhile and are familiar with all the poses."
5,More Depth,This excellent book digs deeper into the facts such as army movement leading up to the battleand many other details lost in the bigger picture books about Gettysburg. The author made a subject that I am so familiar with even more interesting for me. Well worth the cost and time.
1,Try again,This seems to be tv screen size picture stuck in full screen strech mode. So the girls are fatter than they should be.You get no screen options. This would have been good if they payed attention to what they where doing.
1,436 dollars? Greedy %$#@* but good xx movie,I bought mine at adult universe for 30 dollars new It's good xx porno a lot of dry humping the girls are hot and really good picture quality
5,came fast,"This came faster than expected. Good condition, I am satisfied. Just wanted to say thanks!"
3,I felt cheated...,"Some good action, good cast of characters, a pair of ruthless villians sporting some very interesting shapes, but the final encounter left me wondering when the climax was coming? good movie atleast to the end."
5,Great Gift for New Parents,"It is rough being born. We are shoved from a place of warmth and safety into a world that is cold and uncertain. The transition is traumatic. Nurturing massage can help to heal that trauma. Dr. Elaine Schneider's new book, ""Massaging Your Baby"" reminds new parents of the need for healing touch and how it is done. Her work is grounded in extensive research, yet is an easy read and easy to implement.This is an important book and a great gift for new parents.Marlene Potter, DirectorCoconut Grove Center for Counseling"

STAY AWAY from this company. it's a shame that after years of waiting for these titles to be released, this is what we get! roger if you are out there, PLEASE re-release these titles!!!"
1,Bootleg beware! Seek out the earlier releases of these films.,They didn't even bother pirating the GOOD versions. Faded. Pixelated. Offensive to any buyer. Don't give this lame excuse for a company any more money. You will just encourage more.
4,Organ funk at it's peak,"""Down Home Style"" was a party killer in the '70 and I wored out 3 copies in competition with Chicago, Blood Sweat & Tears and Traffic (these groups are still great!). Still one the best of the late '60's jazz organ funk albums out there and McDuff greasy r&b grooves is at its peak. The slow blues ""Memphis in June"" is the highlight on the album with no elbass but pure organbass like the purists wants it. ""Vibrator"" and ""Theme from electric surfboard"" are McDuff funk trademarks on various albums, but this stands out! Even with some some ordinary and less memorable tunes, this album is still intoxicating Hammond organ playing from the Brother!"
5,Quality - Qualité,Much more beautiful than the picture. A nice surprise when I opened the package. A small price for great quality. Silver Speck I will recommend to my friends. I will surely make other purchases. Very good.Beaucoup plus beau que sur la photo. Une belle surprise quand j'ai ouvert le paquet. Un petit prix pour une grande qualité. Je vais recommander Silver Speck à mes amis. Je vais srement faire d'autres achats. Très bon.
3,"Great production quality, but that is it.","The production quality is very good, and the African beat music is also very good (even if it doesn't match the sloppy gymnastics by Chinese performers), but the circus tricks are poorly done, the acrobatics are sloppy, and their supposed kung fu is attrocious."
3,"patchy, but some stone-cold classics in here","All the Blue Break Beats records are essential listening in my book. Sure, end to end listening can sometimes get a little afghan coat, but these albums have pure gold nuggets in amongst the beardy filler. Standout trax here are Gene Harris' funky, funky, funky version of ""Don't Call Me Nigger Whitey"" and Joe Williams utterly SMOKIN' ""Get Out My Life Woman""....what an awesome groove, pool 'o' chocolate voice and a horn section that are so tight they must be underage. Alone , these two tunes are worth the price of admission. A wicked set."
3,"mediocre overall, but *does* have some ""must have"" tracks","The only reason to have this disc is if you have no other way to get the following must-have tracks:* Ode To Billy Joe - Lou Donaldson (used by Mary J. Blige)* Mystic Brew - Ronnie Foster (used by the Tribe Called Quest for Electric Relaxation)* It's Your Thing - Lou Donaldson* Dominoes - Donald Byrd* Get Out Of My Life Woman - Joe Williams (used by Biz I think)I'd add Walk Tall by Cannonball Adderley, but it's *not* the version I think people have heard of, which was fantastically used in Brand Nubian's Concerto In X Minor. For this, you need Walk Tall/Mercy, Mercy, Mercy from Adderley's 1975 Phenix album.I was really happy to get Mystic Brew, Ode To Billy Joe, and Get Out Of My Life Woman, as I had never had them before. The Lou Rawls is a good slow groove. The Shirley Bassey is a good soul groove.The songs I haven't mentioned don't do anything for me; I'd never really heard them before this disc either."
5,great,"Exelente produto eu recomendo a todos ,,perfect quality i recomend to us,,perfect,,great,good simple..exelente qualidade eu queria muito este produto e ele chegou perfeito em mos"
5,"Mistitled, in my opinion, but great!","Though this album is titled 'Bob Brookmeyer and Friends,' it is really a showcase for Stan Getz, containing some of the best tracks he ever recorded throughout his long and storied career. Among them, are definitive versions of ""Misty,"" ""Skylark,"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face."" Stan Getz, known for his 'lyrical' style, is in top form throughout and brings out the best of his cohorts, including two young musicians, Gary Burton on vibes and Herbie Hancock on keyboards, as well as Ron Carter on bass and Elvin Jones on drums. The CD reissue also includes three previously unreleased tracks recorded for this album, one of them, ""Day Dream,"" featuring Tony Bennett. The recording quality is quite good, considering it was originally released in 1964, and the CD remastering effort didn't kill the life in it. If you like Stan Getz or just plain good ol' ensemble jazz, you'll love this."
5,Brookmeyer & Friends,"This album is beautiful. Who would of thought that this pairing would work so well. You got an East Coast rhythm section, (Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Elvin Jones), West Coast horns, (Brookmeyer, Stan Getz) and a midwest vibraphonist, (Gary Burton in one of his early and few appearences as a sideman.)The reviewer who thought this album was commercial represents everything thats wrong with most jazz listeners and musicians. There's nothing commercial at all about the first track. Because it's in a major key?It's almost like a folk song, soulful and groovy. And nothing else on the album is really very commercial at all. This is jazz! And jazz at it's best.I recommend this to anybody who likes great music. Don't be fooled by people who don't know what they're talking about, and who are afraid to listen to anything that's not bebop."
1,Prester John,"Nothing wrong with the text itself: it's a classic. The printing and format, however, can only be described as third world. When I order a book, I expect to hold a book in my hands, not something that looks as it it had been typed on a 1950's typewriter."
4,Help your child learn math,This is a great book for helping your child to learn math up through 9th grade. Well worth the price.
2,Windfall,"After waking from a coma with no memory, Jake has a new chance at life with the woman who saved him, but questions of his past impede the future he might have with Shannon, a woman who needs that futre even more than he. The journey these two fractured souls take is similiar to that of many in the Post Civil War world. Dreams died on the battlefield and afterwards. Alongside the story of Jake and Shannon run several others- Jake's forgotten sister, Jenny, who is fighting to keep her home and Grace's, a woman carrying an illegitmate child and many fears. Somehow, all these seemingly unrelated stories come together, but not without a price. The many shifts and plots tend to make it feel fractured and confusing for the most part.Free will doesn't mean you choose what happens to you, just how you react to it."
3,It was ok....,"This book was alright. I finished it in a couple of hours, and it managed to hold my interest for the majority of the time. It definitely wasn't the best vampire story I've ever read. But it wasn't the worst either. If you want a really good vampire romance story, read Twilight by Stephenie Meyer."
2,Compelling read with poor conclusion,"This book is a short easy read. At the start it is very interesting and pulls you in. However, towards the end the book takes turns with little reasoning behind them. For example, the main character Kerry suddenly declares her love for Ethan. Throughout the book an attraction was described but at the end it just jumps to love? However because she refuses to become a vampire and he refuses to become human (which is odd b/c apparently you can go back and forth in this book) they decide to part and never speak again....what type of love is that? I guess both characters have never heard of being friends before. Overall I felt that details just materialized in this book without explanations and the ending was very incomplete."
2,"I kept thinking it was going to get better, but....","I love to read YA fantasy, and was told this book was different but still good. As I read I kept thinking it was going to get better, that something juicy was right around the corner. After I read the last page I was so disappointed, their was almost no climax, and the ending was just well boring!"
2,Companions Were Flat,"I am a student working on my Masters in Library Science. I read this book for a Teen Literature class. Although the story was interesting and there was a good deal of suspense, the characters were flat and not well developed with the exception of the main charactrer Kerry. This would be a good read for someone looking for a little thrill without much substance."
2,Dated,"Unfortunately, in the light of recent series and publications about relationships with vampires--not the least of which is TWILIGHT by Stephanie Meyer--this novel by Vivian Vande Velde comes up lacking. First published in 1995, the book's plotline takes nearly a hundred pages to really get moving as the main character tries to wrestle with what the readers have known before opening the book: Ethan is a vampire.Though the narration is believable and easy to read, the plot takes too long to get going, ensuring some readers will never finish. The author clearly has talent; perhaps in the 1990's, her Kerry Nowicki stories were engaging. In the 2000's, they have too much competition."
2,Five stars?! Are you serious?,"I read alot of books and alot of them are with vampires and this book to me just sucked. I am though a romance at heart though so i prefer to have a more or less happy ending and this was definatly not one. Vampires can be killed by sunlight.. couldnt you be alittle more creative? And most people, or for me atleast, the main attraction for vampire novels is the overall great romance that comes along with them, i.e Twilight (had to say it), Vampire Academy, Glass Houses, ect. and Companions of the Night definatly didnt have it. The ending sucked... simple. It might have been good back then but compared to all the books now.. this one doesnt even compete."
3,OK but not as Great as I Thought,"Hi, I am 15 years old, I asked my mom to get me this book because so many reviews seemed to praise the book. Now that I have read the book I wonder why people praise it so much. At times it was boring, and seemed to take the long road, just tomake a point. Everything was predictable. The ending in my opinion was left undone. I'd like to say more, but everytime Ido Amazon doesn't print my reviews saying I gave too much insight????? Buy the book used."
1,Terrible!,"This is by far the worst book I have ever experienced. The characters were flat, the plot was almost nonexistent, and overall, there was nothing to recommend this book to a reader. The book had no element or romance, action, or fantasy. It was just 175 pages of nothing. Again, this book has no redeeming qualities. I strongly recommend no one reads it."
5,Understand what you get in a VVV book,"If you want a thoughtful, well-plotted story with characters who stay with you, then VVV is for you. If you want a happy ever after ending, with no loose ends, then you should pass on. This is my third book by VVV and I suspect that leaving the eventual outcome of the story up in the air is a common occurrence in her books. Would I prefer to *know*? Oh, absolutely. And yet - I keep thinking about the story and worrying at different possible outcomes.My personal opinion is that the end of this story is not the end of their story. The two characters have so many choices, that their futures are like a river delta. The author gives us a gift: she leaves the future to our imaginations. I see their stories converging and I am satisfied."
4,Good and bad points,"Good book but way too short. There could have been more conversation(there was literally a handful of dialogue between the main character & vampire). Alot more detail and vampire history could have been added, it always seemed lacking. When the tale was good, it was GOOD. lots of potential just not enough meat and potatoes lol. The ending was disappointing to top it off."
4,Companions of the Night Review,"""Companions of the Night,"" being the first book I read immediately after Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" had a tough act to follow. This book was said to have been adventurous, daring, and suspenseful. I think it did a great job of doing this and compared well with Macbeth. The main character, Kerry, showed that doing the right thing is not always the best thing. I liked that Valde vividly described every scene as to make the reader seem as they were actually there. The suspense was grappling from the start and the action was fast moving.I most identified with Ethan because he uses his power to get what he wanted. I liked his trickery and his elusive personality. Anyone that likes adventure and suspense should read this good old vampire story."
5,Great Teen Vampire Book,"Sixteen-year-old Kerry Nowicki saves the life of a vampire (Ethan Bryne) one night when she stumbles upon a group of vampire hunters bullying him in a Brockport, New York, laundromat. Consequently, she becomes involved in his life when the remaining vampire hunter abducts Kerry's father and 4-year-old brother (Ian) and later kills Ethan's vampire friend (Regina Sloane). Together they spend a great deal of the book driving around in stolen cars, looking for her missing family and a lone vampire hunter whose work isn't finished yet.""Companions of the Night"" is a well-written, exciting book that's hard to put down. There's plenty of action and suspense, with some sparring romance between Kerry and Ethan (though I found Ethan much too manipulative and evasive to be a satisfying heartthrob), which should appeal to vampire fans of all ages."
5,One of the best vampire books I've read!,"OK, move over Bram Stoker,Ann Rice, Laurell K. Hamilton, this is one of the best vampire books I've read and it's written by a young adult fiction writer no less!I've have some of Vivian Vande Velde's other books and this one just blew me away because it's so different! I just love the spunky & witty 16 yr old heroine Kerry Nowicki & the charming, devious, mysterious Ethan Bryne is both seductive and vulnerable at the same time.Very hard to put down, I read it within a few hours and am rerading it again. It's really good!"
5,the best book ever written involving vampires and romance,Vivian Vande Velde is AWESOME! while i was reading this book i laughed and i cryed. COMPANIONS OF THE NIGHT involved a young girl named Kerry who was just a plain oridinary girl who got herself involved in a bad yet life changing experience. kerry helps out a young handsom boy who turns out to be a VAMPIRE. kerry is scared at times when ethan(the vampire) looses his head and trys to attck her but what kerry doesnt relize is that hes suducing her. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!
4,Not just your ordinary vamp story,"Who can put down a book with murder, vampires, revenge, and romance all rolled into it? If you can't, you should try Companions of the Night. Vivian Vande Velde concocts a tale of a modern, new-era vampire who's handsome, ruthless, and has a dry-sense of humor teaming up with a sarcastic, talkative teenage girl, both looking for the same guy for different reasons. For Ethan Bryne, the vampire, he wants to avenge the murder of another vamp, while Kerry, the girl, searches for her kidnapped her family. I think the person who gave this book a five star wrote best when he/she wrote: ""a must read."""
5,Passionate vampire thriller,This was my first of Vande Velde's and I believe the best written. It definitely needs a sequal. An edge of your seat vampire thriller with just enough romance to spice it up just the way you like it. WOW!
2,Inapproprite Material in Vampire Book,"I am a middle school English teacher and I found this book to be interesting reading as an adult, however inappropriate for young adults. The sexual references are too explicit and the blood and gore is too much for some students to handle. Teachers should seriously consider before using this book in a school setting."
2,usless Night,"I really didn't care for this book. As a Vampire fan I try to give differnt books chances. However, I was very dissatisfied with this read.I thought the plot unorigonal and the characters as well."
1,Boring Night,This book was okay if you like dull boring books. This book put me to sleep. I was bored the entire time I was reading this book.
2,In my opinion I thought tis book was awful.,"Sorry to say I hated this book alot. Sure it has its thrills, but it was awful. I always look for new books to read. So I decided to look for opinions online and I found this book. Of course the only reason I was looking was because I was bored stiff. I love stories about vampires. The authors I love to read are Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and J. K. Rowling. Its hard enough to wait for their books to come out. So I always look for new books to read. I liked Kerry and Ethan a little I guess. The fact that Vande Velde vampires can be killed by the sun bores me. I prefer the knife in the heart way. All am saying is that I hated this book, but thats my opinion. So don't let my opinion stop you from buy this book."
5,Companions of the Night,This is seriously the best book I have ever read. It seemed so real and really deepened my interest in vampire books. There were so many gut-renching parts in it. It is a wonderful romance with an ending that made me cry.
5,I LOVED IT!,"This book was really good. I loved Ethan and Kerry. In the end I had expected Kerry to become a vampire or that Ethan would kill her to keep his identity secret. Well, the ending was good and Kerry is a brave teenager and is dealing with a lot of things. I recommened this book to anybody that likes romance, vampires, and adventure."
5,"Fantasic, a fav!!","A great book!! Super sexy, and well written. A fantastic romance/vampire book. There is so much tension between the girl and the vamp, it drives you nuts (in a good way). Great book for all kinds of people."
5,You'll love sinking your teeth into this book!,"Pun intended, but this book was great! I spent two days on the edge of my seat ( bed, as the case may be) reading every word with excitement. I mean, it's hard to find a unique vampire book, but this one has a strange twist. Me being a very strong cult lover and follower, I just found this to be a must- have for any young cult reader! I'm ready to dig into a sequel, so I hope to see one soon. The love, strangeness, the journey, and the thought wavering just mezmorized me. Don't listen to me, go buy it!"
2,"No, that's really the ending.","Companions of the Night was.... okay. Certainly not the best vampire story out there (or romance story for that matter). The characters could have been more developed. I never felt I truly knew what Kerry, the main character, was feeling. By the end of the novel that fact became infuriating. I found the plot interesting enough, but the ending?!? That's what makes a damn novel! And this one was truly dissapointing. It didn't wrap things up, just kind of left you there breathless, desperately searching for more pages that weren't there, thinking over and over ""is that really how it ends?"" Perhaps some find the ending ""realisitic"" but I found it gravely unbefitting. But, I give it props for having an original outlook on vampires. The history was intriguing."
5,Fast read,"I've been reading this genre (i.e., paranormal young adult fiction) with a vengeance and this is one of the few books that I read straight through. Really enjoyed it."
5,The Silent Brotherhood: Inside America's Racist Underground,Excellent read. The authors do a great job of reporting the facts surrounding Robert Matthews and those ill-fated souls around him.
4,"A Good Read, But...","""The Silent Brotherhood"" is certainly a good read, and is also extremely well-researched, but ""Brotherhood of Murder"" by Thomas Martinez is even better, as it is a firsthand account. Still, Flynn & Gerhardt present the facts in a straightforward, objective manner. Definitely recommended."
5,Good Read,A lot of action! Isn't it ridiculous how you have to enter a minmum amount of words to give a product review. Makes you not want to leave a review.
3,"well made, but over priced","I just purchase this replacement belt at Amazon for $168. The belt is made of flexible plastic material that appears well made and thick and should last a long time. The only draw back is the price. In my opinion, it is not worth 168 dollars and it should be priced well under $100 dollars. You might consider buying a non-Performax brand and save a lot of money."
4,Good,"My mom is a Type 2 diabetic and I ordered this for her. She is having metformin as well.While not dramatic, this does help to reduce her BG levels by 5-10 points."
5,Great product!,"Insulow has been working well, along with a low carb diet, to keep my blood sugars pretty near normal. I saw a marked improvement right away once I started using it. I know I will continue to use this product as part of my diabetes control."
3,33% Increase in price!!!!????,"What's up with a 33% increase in price in one month? With no warning? Insulow may be of help, but I've been taking it on faith in Dr Bernstein. This kind of increase in price with no warning or explaination makes me question the legitimacy of the company & whether or not to trust them enough to continue using the product."
3,Insulow-helpful? I don't know,My bloodsugars are totally out of control even with oral medication. I've tried every other diabetes medication with bad side effects. I tried this based on other reviews and I can't say that it has had any effect good or bad. I haven't used it regularly so maybe if I used it at every meal it might have more effect. The only positive is that I've had no side effects with Insulow. My physician scoffed when I told him that I had been using Insulow. He told me that only prescription medications would have any effect on my blood sugars.
5,Really helped with 'burning' sensation in my feet,"I have been taking this for about 4 weeks now, and I've noticed that the burning sensations I was getting on the bottom of my feet (especially the right) has almost disappeared. It no longer feels overwhelming at times, and I seem to have better feeling in my big toe as well.It helped some with my blood sugars, but the largest benefit for me has been in the neuropathy calming down."
2,"Good reputation, but side effects","I've read a lot of good things about Insulow on diabetes boards. However, when I took it for about two weeks, it gave me severe indigestion and I finally discontinued it. I didn't notice any changes in my blood glucose readings, but it really didn't have long enough to work. As always, YMMV."
3,Dissatisfied with this edition,I selected this edition for the more literal translation which I found easier to read that versions that attempt to twist classic works into modern speech. The translation was fine but the main issue I have with this edition is the end notes. Many of the end notes seem directed an clarifying disputes in translation rather than giving additional information to the modern reader to help understand the text.While comparing several versions I selected this one based on the text without realizing it's only the first four books. It's clearly my fault given the title but I see no reason to purchase this book when there are other versions with all seven books.I intend to purchase another edition and may revise my view on the end notes since it's possible I've been spoiled by Strassler's Landmark series.
3,the sequel doesn't meassure up,"If you want to know the plot, then read my review of Captive Factory Girls The Violation. The only plot difference is that the new girl is tricked into working in the factory by her boyfriend, who she thinks has run-up a large debit.Other than that difference, this is the same movie, only there are no girl on girl scenes, which was my favorite scence from the first movie."
5,Fac Girl 2,"To be ownest bought DVD just for cover women is really sexy and DVD was good, movie was cool and lived up to expectation, seller gave great review and even better service will buy from again Thank You."
5,The Poet of the Cosmic Cloud Returns!...,"Though, not as good as Spine of God, and certainly not as good as Dopes to Infinity (Which is simply unsurpassable) it is a great album. From the spacy, Jim Morrison like, poetry of Cyclops Revolution to the trippy acoustics of Cage Around the Sun, to the Sabbath like Evil (Is Going On), the tracks are pure Magnet. It bridges the gap between Spine of God and Powertrip, mixing in the essential ingredients of both. A truly noteworthy album. If your a Magnet fan and don't have this yet, actually if your a music lover, pick this up right away, you won't be disappointed!"
4,"A weaker effort, but still a cool headtrip!","I wanted to give this album 3.5 stars, but that's not an option and I couldn't give MonMag anything less than that. So 4 stars it is. Well, being Monster Magnet, It rocks. In the grand scheme of their albums, this is not one of the better ones. While a step up from 25...Tab in quality, the production is a double edged sword. The sound Magnet seems to be going for is a concrete slab to the face. While this is all well and good, especially in the Sabbath rock of Twin Earth, it can get really annoying with the vocal distortion (i.e. Brainstorm) and sometimes, the guitar has a needling ear piercing noise that really detracts from the music. Still, there are more than a few killer cuts on this album, and It's worth getting if you like the band. If you want early, stoned Magnet then get Spine of God. If you want the later, singable Magnet then get Dopes to Infinity."
5,SUPERJUDGE great rock!,"SUPERJUDGE is a terrific album, and although it took many listens to appreciate SUPERJUDGE, those listens were worth it. Dave Wyndorf continues to be one of the most creative and talented songwriters of all time.The album gets off to a good start with the double-attack of the atmospheric rocker ""Cyclops Revolution"" and the splendid Sabbath-like ""Twin Earth"". ""Cage Around The Sun"" has a great acoustic intro and fleshes it's rock out enough to keep you interested. ""Dinosaur Vacume"" is another mind**** from Wyndorf, while the stomping ""Evil (Is Goin' On)"" hits you hard. Other highlights are the title track, ""Elephant Bell"", and the rocker ""Stadium"".SUPERJUDGE began the path towards DOPES TO INFINITY, and SUPERJUDGE will be a welcome addition to your Monster Magnet collection. Give this one a spin, and see the evolution of the Magnet!"
4,"written for someone else, not me","There is a serious need for research and thought on ways to teach creative writing to foreign students from countries where creative writing is not encouraged.As an overseas English teacher, I am able to persuade my students to answer multiple choice, true-false, and short answer questions, but I draw a blank whenever I ask a question which calls for the least bit of creativity.Most of the material in the book seemed like truisms to me: topic sentences, organization of material, citing references, and avoiding logical fallacies. However, this may all be new to a student from a culture which does not encourage creative writing.Such a student is sure to relate to this book, because there is a second person pronoun on almost every line.The appendix includes articles which the author suggests as topics for discussion. They don't pertain directly to the topic at hand, but they are interesting. Read them anyway."
5,A beautiful and thought provoking book on the poetry of Zen.,"I have had an interest in Zen and Asian poetry for more than forty years. This fantastic book begins with an introduction to how the philosophy of Zen can directly relate to a beautiful poem. This book has two sections. The first section covers Chinese poems taken from numerous sources. The second section covers poems from the Japanese poetry masters.In general, the Chinese poems are a little longer in length; nevertheless, all the poems in this collection are a joy to read. If you like Asian poetry, you will love this book. It is filled with beautiful and thoughtful poems that may provide you with Zen enlightement.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: a poetic tribute to warriors)"
5,Excellent,"This is a wonderfully diverse collection of poetry. I've since purchased books by many of the featured poets, finding each a worthy read. The one aspect I didn't find all that interesting was the last few pages of haiku."
5,Great Shows with Kristanna Loken!,"PainKiller Jane is simply killer! For those who love Kristanna Loken, you will love this DVD set. It's even possible to watch this entire set within one day for those who don't sleep much. It would only be less than 18 hours tops (including time for switching DVDs after completions)."
1,painfully dreadful,"I wanted to like this show as it featured a strong female character. After 3 viewings PKJ was a royal pain on the eyes. Bad writing, bad direction, ianely stupid plots & mediocre acting. For this, SCIFI cancelled The Dresden Files. Sheesh!!PKJ is painfully dreadful & not worth the money. If you really want to watch it, you'd be better off renting it."
2,Painkiller Jane Review,"I hoped this would be an entertaining show. However, the plot and pace of the show was slow and unimaginative, the look of the show was grey and the acting never rose above average. I think it was appropriate to cancel this series after one season. (For comparison be aware that I like Day break, Heroes, Eureka, Both series of the Bionic woman, Angel, Babylon 5, Smallville and the original Star Trek - Painkiller Jane really is not in the same category as these shows). I regret buying the DVDs."
2,Hugely disappointing,"SciFi retooled a promising pilot/mini-series, recast it, and started from scratch: they blew it big time. Wooden acting, dull stories, and voice-overs from Loken that are horrible. The main 'threat' in the plot are people with unusual mental powers called Neuros, but she persists in pronouncing the work ""knee-rows"" and they never troubled themselves to fix it. The look and feel, production values are not bad, but the writing and acting are of poor quality. Save your money. Buy Dresden Files or Eureka or BSG to get some good stuff (rare though it may be) from the SciFi channel."
3,Oh No! No ending,"I watched all 6 disks wanting to know what was finally going to happen. And nothing. It leaves you totally hanging. I was disappointed. I went online and found out no second season, so I guess they were planning on making one and something happened. Maybe that's why they leave so many unanswered questions. I wished I would have know this ahead so I wouldn't have watched at all. If no conclusion doesn't bother you then these are fun to watch, something different. I'm not a fan of big blood splatters but it only happened infrequently."
2,"Average Show, good cast","It was a nice show, certainly not great. When you have a clip show after only 15 episodes, that says it all. But it also had it's moments, Rob Stewart (McBride) & Noah Danby (Connor) were my favorite characters. Especially Noah as Connor, he was the one with the humor, always looking to score with Jane. All and all, some bad episodes, some good."
2,Missed the Point,"Painkiller Jane is supposed to be an entertaining twist on a comic book character. Unfortunately the stories miss the point. There is an ongoing plot line that had my interest through ought but some episodes were too pointless for the plot line.One of the reasons I was excited about this show was because it had the lovely Kristanna Loken as Jane, maybe it was the character she was playing but it looked like she plumped up before this series and was in need of some Jenny Craig.The acting was OK but you could tell by the third episode why this show only lasted one season. Too bad because there was a good idea behind the story, I think this show was doomed by the unimaginative writers."
5,funny and touching,"I never saw Troll 2, but this documentary makes me want to. A touching, funny and sometimes plain weird portrait of some of the 'actors' who starred in the best worst movie ever."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!,Amazing movie/doc. Please watch both the movie and the documentry.. PURE AMAZINGNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can not piss on hospitality! If you do not watch this documentry and the original film you are a fool. This film is one of the best horror films of all time!!
5,Awesome movie,If you love troll 2 you'll love this even if you dont know what troll 2 is you'll like it it does help though.hillarious touching and great to watch all in one
1,run time : 22 minutes ? HORSE $#^* !!!!!,"Why is the run time as long as one episode of any power ranger season ? Simple , because the dvd only has one episode . Infact , since all 5 dvd volumes of power rangers spd all has a run time of 22 minutes , you'll wind up buying one episode per disc if your stupid enough to do so instead of buying the entire series ."
3,"Great on VHS, NOT ON DVD",Please dont purchase this film on DVD at all. Instead get the VHS because it is great and much better
2,No Ghostface killer here,The title made me think of mystery of chess boxing featuring ghostface killer. No where near that level.This movie could have been better. Pretty sinister villian that uses the Black Palm technique. Good end fight. but it was too much like Invincible Armor.
4,Communicating About Health: Current Issues and Perspectives,This book was in excellent condition when it arrived. This book is very informational. I would recommend this book to anyone whom is wanting to learn about Communicating About Health: Current Issues and Perspectives
3,Only purchase it if you HAVE to,"I am a student and this book was assigned to my class. I thought it was way too expensive for the little bit of information I received from it. I purchsed it new, but I suggest you purchase it the cheapest price you can find it."
1,My Experience,"I purchased this text book on feb, 3rd and never got it from the seller. Isent numerous messages and they never responded. I have used other seller inthe past and never had this problem. I am very dissapointed with amazon for not responding to my request and I haven't gotten my money back. I am sure it would have been great if I had a chance to read it."
5,<this album needs more stars!> ***********************,"Sentenced is a SWEET band of melodramatic harmonies that just dig deep into the soul and provide a soothing comfort to any METAL lover's ears. I agree with the mississippi fan's review that Amorphis kicks @$$, but I will have to go out on a limb and say that Sentenced definitely beats the competition."
5,Wow! This must be heard!,"This is one amazing piece of work! Sentenced is awesome! The vocalist sounds somewhat like James Hetfield (from Metallica) but musically these guys are unique. ""Farewell"" is the best song on here, with ""One with Misery"" not far behind. There are no bad songs, they are all amazing in their own way. ""Mourn"" is right up there with Metallica's ""Call of Ktulu"" on my list of favorite instrumentals. Just beautiful. I want it played at my funeral. While this CD does have the most depressing lyrics I have ever heard (they make Staind sound cheery by comparison), it is very emotional and very good. If you like Metallica, Black Sabbath, Candlemass, or just good music in general, you would be wise to pick this up. It's a shame more people don't know about this band. They must be heard."
5,Great stuff!,"Recommended by the guy who pumps out our septic tanks and it does work. It keeps the bacteria growing and the system working just fine. It doesn't matter if you dump the stuff into the toilets or right into the septic tank. We only use it after the tanks are pumped out which is every 3 years as recommended for a sandmound system. Great stuff. I guess once a year wouldn't hurt, though."
4,I think it works because I haven't had problems,I guess this keeps my lines clear like it's supposed to because I haven't had any problems since I've been using it whereas I did have some problems before I started using it.
1,This Book Proves The Religious Right Are Psychotics,"They won't let me rate this disgusting garbage with zero stars.Beating babies with a stick? You Religious Reich whackos should all be arrested for child abuse and have your kids taken away from you.You are sick, psychotic, disgusting people and you are NOT Christians.Who Would Jesus Beat??"
1,"Another misguided, misinformed approach","This book represents another in a long series of misguided and misinformed approaches to childrearing. However, by purportedly wrapping itself in Christianity, and espousing physical violence, it is also dangerous."
1,Growing Kids God's Way???? I don't think it's even close!!!!!!!!!!,"Please please please do research on the area of attaching to your child vs..this nutty, unnatural way of parenting...I HATEEEEEEEE with a passion the views taught in this book. There is ZERO positive benenfits to putting your infant on a schedule and having them follow it..ie not feeding or holding your child b/c it isn't on the schedule..The authors should be horse whipped for 1st calling their gruel practices ""God's way"" and 2nd for teaching moms and dads not to listen to your child, meet their needs and develop a strong attachment from birth that will last a lifetime.Please do research on what crying it out really does to the brain of a helpless child and the lifelong effects of this ridiculous way of parenting.The only people I have talked to that love this theory have unresolved attachment issues themselves and therefore, offer the same structure/non nurturing environment to their children."
1,Sickening,"Reading this book gave me the feeling of stepping into Abu Ghraib. Hitting babies with sticks is not a Christian activity. Jesus believed children were close to God and that adults should emulate children. Jesus believed in being kind and patient, and never once advocated any hitting or stoning or any sort of violence. Avoid this book like the plague, like the devil in lamb's clothing that it is.Hucksters have for centuries misused the Bible to advocate cruel treatment of women, slavery and other horrors. They completely avoid Jesus's messages of love, peace and forgiveness and instead try to convince others that Christianity means being cruel, unfair and violent. Try Dr. Whitehurst's book ""How Would Jesus Raise a Child?"" rather than books that advocate behavior true followers of Jesus would never condone."
1,I was a GKGW kid - now I'm a GKGW survivor!,"GKGW wreaked havoc on my psychological well-being and I am only beginning to repair the damage with extensive therapy.My parents implemented the system when I was 5 years old and adhered strictly to the guidelines. Essentially, I was taught to not express my emotions, that my needs were not important, and that I should behave out of fear.The only purpose of this system is to destroy your chances at a good relationship with your children. They will not learn to behave because it is the right thing to do/pleasing to god; they will, instead, learn to behave because they are afraid of you. They will learn that they cannot trust their emotions and that it is indulgent to meet their needs. It will be very difficult for them to learn to trust and rely on others because GKGW teaches children that they are to be self-sufficient from a time when they are not developmentally capable of the ezzo's expectations.Please STOP the insanity of GKGW!"
5,Excellent Teaching source in every way!,"This book has helped My Husband and I raise our two daughters in the most excellent way. When applied they are invaluable to both the parents and children!! An excellent group study! Our children are well into their teens now, but still carry this wonderful core of understanding in their hearts as well as we do. We often wonder as we look at our children today and all we can say is that this is ""God"" because nothing we could have personally done would have had the same results. Its has just been the greatest source and most valuable study we have ever been in. Highly recommended!"
1,Haven't People Learned By Now?,Haven't people learned by now the dangers of hitting children? And yet here is another book telling parents to hit their kids! Hitting your kids will make them violent. Can't you guess why there is so much violence in this country? It starts at home with books like this one!
1,Child abuse in God's name,"This is an abusive child abuse manual written by a deeply injured dysfunctional author, for other injured child abusers, who were abused too as children. The abusive circle will simply continue in generations for such families who believe in violence and the right to hit other people.It truly sickens me to read how the author recommends hitting babies with sticks, as well as depriving them from milk. Babies' brains aren't fully developed till adult age, and therefore, these little people don't understand why their (sick) parent is inflicting pain on them. To inflict pain on someone you love is certainly NOT love. This is called abuse, in this care, serious child abuse."
1,Ezzo impersonating God,"Ezzo appears to have climbed into the mind of God, and now pretends to speak for him. ""...God's divine intention for parents to use physical pain to correct a child's rebellious activities."" God's son would be the first to object, as even a cursory reading of the New Testament would tell us. Ezzo tells us to hit the child ""to free him of his guilt of sin"". Those who completed Psych 101 recognize this as projection. Ezzo is a man in deep psychiatric trouble, and before he does more harm to children ought to be taken into custody for psychiatric counseling.- Norm Lee, author of Parenting Without Punishing"
1,The Voice Of the Devil,"It's sad enough that this guy is telling people to abuse their children but the saddest part is he's telling them that this is God's love. This is definately NOT love & definately NOT from God. This is just another way of the devil keeping people, especially children FROM God. God didn't like it when we beat HIS SON, what makes you think HE likes people abusing the gifts He has given them??? I wish people would ask GOD what He thinks about this & LISTEN to what HE says, instead of following the devil's advice."
1,unchristian manual for abuse,"If you're looking for some good books on Christian parenting, give this one a pass and keep looking. (But if you want to rear frightened children who grow up to be haunted by fear of an angry God and eventually leave their faith in order to keep their sanity--well, then try it.) These methods seem to me so far from God's love they would damage any child's sense of security, love, and healthy self control. Ugh, what a terrible book."
1,"Wretched, Misguided Advice","Authors advise beating 14 month olds to 5 years olds with a ""flexible stick to obtain instant, complete obedience."" They claim this is loving. Beating children and witholding milk from infants (another piece of sage advice given by the Ezzos) is psychologically and physically abusive. These practices will undermine your children's security, attachment, and sense of well being. They are not loving, but harmful, and certainly not accepted practices by the Christians I've known. If you're looking for parenting advice and guidance look at John Gottman'sThe HEART OF PARENTING: Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child, andkids are worth it! Revised Edition: Giving Your Child the Gift of Inner Discipline (Harperresource Book). These contain sensible, intelligent advice, and practical guidance that will teach your children to not only respect and love you but also themselves."
1,Violence Begets Violence,"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.Do you want someone to cause you deliberate, physical (and emotional) pain when you do something wrong?If you were hungry, would you want someone to withhold food from you, because they didn't feel like feeding you?If you were crying and afraid, would you want to be left in a dark room all alone (particularly if you couldn't walk, crawl, roll over, speak, feed yourself, warm or cool yourself)?And for the love of God, isn't it time we stopped perpetuating this might-is-right mentality??? (not to mention this father-as-God mentality)"
1,THIS BOOK IS AWFUL!!,This is not God's way! Parents need to listen to their Gog given insticts. This type of parenting damages the bond between parents and their children.
1,Horrible book!,"This is NOT Godly! Jesus would not have us switch a 6 month old or any child. I found this book and ""advice"" disgusting and very sad.I suggest something from Dr. Sears or Biblical Parenting from Pastor Crystal Lutton. These books are true grace-based discipline!"
2,The Parsons Daughter.,I would read three books at least a week and this was one or the rare ones I could noy complete.It is old fashioned in values and writing and needs a good edit.The characters were so unreal that I found I could not identify with them at all.I can not recommend in any way.
1,Leaks!!!,"In about 1 year the gasket to the tank will dry out and the unit will leak all over the floor. They dont sell the gasket, you have to buy the cap as well. Only problem is that Honeywell is not supporting its customers and making this part!!"
5,Best unit on the market,"Seems to be the best humidifier of its type on the market. Reasonably quiet, and good capacity. We purchased two for two locations."
1,"would not purchase again,",I purchased this unit about 3 years ago. We only use it in the winter when the humidity is really low (around 10 weeks a year). The electric motor started to squeal after the first year and now the motor stopped working this year. I would not recommend.
2,Not the Greatest,"If you have a small room and don't mind a decent amount of noise this could be your choice. It has a large capacity but that didn't help because it's not dispersing moisture. The sponge type material inside, which quickly fills with brown gucky mold, dries out rock hard at the top while wet only at the bottom. It does keep an even moisture in a small room or a medium room with no heat blowing. The Crane Ultrasonic kills this thing in my opinion. I have many vintage guitars and like the humidity to be just right, this did not keep up, and noisy. The only drawback with an ultrasonic is you must get it up off the ground or it will get wet, three feet up and your fine."
1,Humidifier fan/motor makes awful noises about 9 months after purchase,"This is the second humidifier of this model I've purchased. The first one only lasted 3 months as it suffered a catastrophic end at the curious hands of my then 13 month old son. We promptly purchased another one as it is very dry where we live. The humidifier fan motor is making a terrible noise after only nine months of use; I think the bearings are worn in the motor. The humidifier does have a 3 year warranty, but I've got to spend extra money just to send the humidifier back to Kaz.Honeywell just to have them evaluate it. I will not be purchasing another Kaz/Honeywell humidifier."
1,disappointing humidifier,after lots of research this seemed like the best option but it is really loud. would not buy again.
3,honeywell hcm-300t,Dislike/ This new honeywell tower humidfier is not very quiet compared to my old ones but it still works fine.ThANK YOU !
2,at least t looks good.,"Lets start with the positive, it looks good and is relatively quiet. Now the bad. It has no auto shut off when out of water so it wastes energy. I never seems to full humidify a room half the rated size. It sprays water onto the floor and will cause your carpet to mildew if you are not careful and shut it down with water still in it. Since the unit does not shut down when out of water it will continue to dry out the filter and never re-saturate. Worse of all after only 5 weeks of limited use this unit has develop mold in the filter and in the filter holder. This health device is making me sick and will be going back. I only give the 2 star because it is decent looking and quiet.-joe"
1,Junk,We purchased this humidifier in November 06. It has broken twice and now it's in the garbage (Jan. 08). The unit operated noisily up until we trashed it when the fan motor stopped working.Not Recommended
1,"Fool me twice, shame on me","The UV purification system attracted me initially when I saw it at Home Depot. It was noisy as I understand high output evaporative units are, but it put out a decent amount of moisture. Fan died after the first year, nothing could be done to service it. OK, bad luck I figured, and got another through an etailer. This one had a leaky cap that left a gallon or so of water on my oak floor for me to find one day after work. My wife ginned up a thicker gasket which kept the water in, but come on...the fargin' thing ought to hold its own water! The moisture output on this one was a fraction of the first unit, and the fan died on this one too. Kaz/Honeywell won't be seeing my money again anytime soon."
1,pure crap!,"Like other viewers, I had the same problem with this unit. Loud noise just before the fan crapping out! Don't buy this!"
4,nice humidifier,"This humidifier is pretty quiet and does a great job. Just watch the size of the area you are trying to use it in. I used it to humidify my whole house (1500 sq. ft.) so it took a while to get it to where it needed to be, but that is twice the size its supposed to be. Highly recomend this unit. It definitely makes a huge difference. No more shocks in the winter or dry skin, and a lower heating bill. It's amazing how big a difference a GOOD humidifier makes. This is a wick style humidifier, the best kind. Don't buy the evaporator kind, it will cost you more than its worth."
1,"100% Horrible, Rebranded Junk","We bought two of this identical product labeled as Vicks, one for each child. Huge mistake! Both humidifiers, just over a year old, made so much noise from the fan that they regularly woke our kids before they were removed. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PRODUCT. This same product was originally sold by Vicks and now has been relabeled by Honeywell. This is made from cheap plastic components and the design breeds mold accumulation that cannot be accessed or cleaned by any human standards. AVOID! This is a clear instance where the look and cost does not translate into product quality. I can only assume the others writing positive reviews have not owned this quite long enough to realize the enormous mistake they made in purchasing this product."
5,"So far, I love it!","I looked all over for a floor model humidifier for our bedroom and was thrilled when I finally found this one. I've had table top models and it's messy turning the tanks upsidedown to put them in the machine after filling. This one isn't. I don't know what's going on with the ones people are saying leak ... this is the neatest humidifier I've ever owned. Are you sure you're closing the cover as tight as it can be? My humistat works fine too.I've only had this for a couple of weeks, but so far, it's been great. Attractive, neat and easy to fill. I'd definitely recommend this model."
1,Too many 1 star reviews to buy this,I take all the reviews very seriously and after reading them I will not be buying this product. I hope the manufacturer reads all these and realizes that I'm not alone in making this decision. Make a better product and make it in the USA!
4,loved it in the past,"I purchased one of these 5 years ago. I loved it so much i decided to buy another when mine quit working. This one works much better in that it does turn off when there is no water left, what i dont like about it is where you pour water into it, at the screw cap it will come undone if you try to carry it. The one i owned befor had no problems there. It performs for what i bought it for to humidify my bedroom at night"
2,not good,"One bad thing vents point down ward instead of up and out, I need the humidity in the air not on the floor."
2,ANYTHING BUT QUIET,"This unit is extremely noisy; I have to keep it in another room, with the door shut. With constant use, the filter needs replacement after a month and a half - and that's using distilled water, which also is costing me money, and the h2o is taking up room to store. A vaporizer is infinitely better - quiet and no extra expenses - needs de-germing only once a week - unless you believe the scare stories about people tripping into it."
1,"Not good, smells horrible","We have went through many humidifiers. We thought this one was a good one. It smells horrible, like moldy feet. We clean it regularly and change the filter, yet just after a few days it begins to smell. We are done using humidifiers after this one. I just want my money back."
1,"Bad product, equally bad warrenty","This product worked fine the first winter, but when I took it out of storage the 2nd season, the fan would blow air but as soon as you hit the humidity button the unit turned off. I tried several days blowing air only but the water level did not go down, so it was not adding humidity to the room. I called the customer service number on the box and was told my house must be over 95% humidity, and was told I had to pay the return shipping for them to verify this units condition. As the cost of the return is close to the cost of this unit, needless to say I will not be buying another Honeywell product anytime soon."
1,Lasted only 1 winter,We bought this in January of 2011 and used it through the rest of couple months in the winter and it did work fine with no noise as such. Then we had to put it aside for 7-8 months and have started using it for couple of months now. It started with a creeky weird noise and after a few weeks is now totally dead. Not sure why??? Will have to call the customer care to get it replaced.Will definitely not recommend to buy this product. Worthless.
2,too loud,works good and could tell a difference in the air quality. but it is too loud!!! my 2 year old is so scared of it that i have to run it while he is not in the room. definately not quiet compared to the smaller models. so disappointed that i cannot run it all night in my son's room.
2,Wish it would have lasted!,We've had this brand of humidifier before. I automatically replaced it with the same brand. This one has only lasted two months. First got noisy and then failed. I wish they would make it better because I liked the large tank and filling was easy. Now I don't know what I'm going to do!!
1,JUNK,This was my second unit. The first one lasted 2 seasons. This unit only 1. In both cases the fan died. I've learned my lesson. JUNK!
3,LIGHTS OUT?,"I've had good luck with this product for about 6 months then the unit stopped working. Thinking that the UV light had burned out and that the unit won't work without it, I went online to find a replacement...right!!! No luck, No Replacement light could I find. Honeywell doesn't carry them which is odd since it is there product. I'm still trying to figure out where to get a light for it and to see if that's why it stopped working. If a company is going to sell a product they should also carry the parts to keep it working."
2,Great but short lived....,"Loved this humidifier - easy to fill compared to other units. A little loud but did the job great, this is actually the 2nd identical humidifier I bought - the first one's motor wore out after two years and just stopped - no rhyme or reason. Well folks, this one did the same thing just this week. Incredibly disappointed in how things are made these days.I hope you read this review before you buy."
4,It does its job.,"It's not as quiet as I expected, my cow crane was just as quiet if not quieter. But, it does its job well... keeping my room well humidified and helps my son breath more easily. I also like the fact that I don't have to add water every night, like I used to do with my cow crane."
1,Worst Humidifier I've Ever Owned,"I've owned many humidifiers over the years and this one is by far the worst. I eventually returned it to the store and here are the reasons why: 1) Even on high, it struggled to keep my average size bedroom humid enough. 2) At least twice it started to leak from the back for absolutely no reason. Once when it happened, it wasn't even running. 3) The moist air coming from the bottom caused the carpet to be continually moist and eventually stinky, but maybe this was leakage I just wasn't seeing when it happened. 4) Almost every time I put the tank back after filling it, a spray/mist of water came out the front and again, onto the carpet. 5) The filters got smelly way faster than normal. I have nothing good to say about this humidifier and Honeywell should be ashamed of themselves for not testing their design better. I now own a Holmes humidifier."
3,Honetwell HCM - 300T Humidifier,"Pro -Works well and as describedCon - no auto shut off when empty, filter drys up quickly and needs to be replaced oftenI would not buy another one"
3,A nice humidifier for the south,"I like the bacteria killing properties of this humidifier. I live in NC, where the winters aren't very long. I only need a humidifier 2 months out of the year. The water tank is sturdy and fits under my sink faucet well. It has to be held the entire time it's being filled, since it doesn't have a flat top it will flop over if you let go. So it gets heavy while the water level reaches the top.I am one to recycle filters by soaking them in vinegar and rinsing. The filter on this one doesn't stand up to soaking and rinsing, only 4 or 5 times and then it starts to shred. This means I buy a new filter once a month in the winter.I recommend this for folks in the south. If you live up north, I would recommend one with a larger tank for water."
3,not perfect,"The product is easy to use, but for a small room the tank runs out of water fairly quicly. The filters gets dirty or brown very easily even when you use filtered water."
4,Humidifies well but durability questionable,"I've purchased 2 of these units. They humidify well, are pretty quiet, have a humidistat, are easy to refill, and last a full day running constantly. I also like the UV light feature that supposedly sanitizes the water. Durability is a question though. My first unit's fan started to fail (noisy) after about a year. Kaz CS replaced the unit although I had to pay for shipping to return the defective unit. The second unit I purchased is about 4 months old and is running fine. BTW I bought the second unit at Costco where it costs only $50 and includes 3 filters."
3,"Nice unit, but some minor issues","I have the black version of this honeywell model. Nice unit, great features, liked the tower design and the fact that it had a UV bulb and protec filter to keep unit clean. However, the humidistat controls are very unreliable after two returns the same issue kept happening, the unit does not turn on/off when it should leaving my room either over humidified and cold or very dry by not turning back on. Its fairly quiet, reasonably priced (shop around) easy to use/maintain just clean the basket and replace the filter and your good to go. I had decided to get another model with more reliable features."
1,Why does it take so long to ship?,I bought this air purifier on 09/06/2010 today is 09/10/2010 and the product still has not shipped.I made sure the product was in stock before buying to get it ASAP.If it does not shipp by the end of the day today I will cancel my order
2,Little Substance in This Book,"I have a personal library of over twenty books on colored pencil and unfortunately, this is the weakest book I own on the topic. There is very little on technique and there is a general lack of substance. If you are looking for an overview on colored pencil, there are far better books available. One that comes to mind is Exploring Colored Pencil by Sandra Angelo. And if you are looking for technique or practical information this book simply doesn't cut it."
2,A repeat of his other book,"I was so excited to get this book. Extremely disappointed when it arrived! Most of the illustrations were from his other book. New cover and not much more. I paid good money for the same thing I already had! Pictures are worth a thousand words, such a disappointment-- won't purchase any of his books again."
3,Meh,"You get what you pay for. This is only half as good as pens selling for $40,000 here on Amazon. Still, if this bad economy has you cutting back on essentials, this pen will do in a pinch. Personally, I'd fire a maid or butler to make up the difference rather than compromise on my writing utensils, but if you don't mind settling for less than the best, this is pen is a fair choice."
4,best yet,"i think this is their best effort yet. it's beautiful! it's so dreamy and colorful. 'on the lake' is the most incredible thing ever! beautiful nostalgic emotion induced by that dreamy pedal steel guitar... and 'comin back' is awesome with its salsa-esque flavoring. 'as you fall' is perfect for a rainy day and 'the waters deep' is, again, beautiful nostalgia. this albums reminds me of happy place where everyone is having a good time and everything is beautiful. the only thing missing here is zoe johnston!"
2,Kind of a Yawner...,"Well-crafted pop songs but where's the quirkiness that I've come to know and love in Bent over their past two full-length recordings? Their kitschy samples were what separated them from the millions of other ambient, downtempo, and, dare I say it, adult contemporary bands out there. Now it's just all seeming like so much of the other fluffy, Enya ripoff schlock that's on the market these days. Haven't picked up the 'Flavour Country' EP yet but after giving this one several serious hard listenings, I'm a bit hesitant to do so...."
2,Sample masters come undone,I was aware that Bent's sampling days were mostly behind them before I heard this album - and was convinced I'd be in for a good helping of ingenious and well-orchestrated melodies: a serious entry into originality. I am quite suprised to find that without the guidance of great (sampled) baselines and lyrics the Bent quest goes awry - sounding like a very polished single-finger-on-the-keyboard/first-words-to-fit experiment in places. Not memorable for any other reason other than the utter lack of memorable moments.
5,"Really nice, with a cute, fun feel to it...",Its a very nice CD. Sort of upbeat and fun and it has some very nice mellow songs in it. You can play from beginning to end and not be dissappointed.
4,white sox monopoly review,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift; the recipients were so excited about this gift that we played with it immediately. My only negative is that this game will become passe in a few years because most of the players featured in the game will not be with the Sox. Still, it should live on as a collector's item, if nothing else."
4,EXCELLENT AND A HALF,"Be not afraid, musicheads. You may expect these tough ladies to be guarding MilesOn the Corner. In reality, they are hanging with Donald Byrd, right here.The comparison is one of opposites. While Miles was creating a pitch black, funky improvisational brew in the first half of the 1970s Byrd made a melodic, chipper funk, filled with flutes, voices, and his own sailing trumpet, You can even draw the opposition down to the playing: Miles spitting minimal wha wha nails, and Byrd sailing over the top with the same cheer as a bop record.Byrd started this template withBlackbyrd--smooth jazz when the term meant chirping grooves provided by aces like bassist Chuck Rainy and, here, drummer Harvey Mason, and did not mean digital vanilla.There is plenty of flavor-- and substance--to go around on this too often overlooked branch of 1970s jazz, and if you have dismissed music such as Street Lady, you just ain't listening."
4,you can Vibe off this ALbum,another Laid-Back album from Donald Byrd.His Arrnagements&Feel make this ALbum as along with his other 70's output a must.His Grooves here capture a Scene&Vibe going on.I can Listen to His 70's Output all day&Night.another solid Production&Instrumentation on this set.you feel the Vibe going down.
3,Good - but not eprfect,"The first shipment, a piece was broken and very obvious. I returned and it was replaced very promptly - thank you. The second was also broken, but not as obvious, nor did it make it unusable so I kept it. It was a present for a student in college who loves using it, but it would have been much better if it had no damage at all."
1,handle broke,"Purchased the cart 6/2009. Have used it once weekly since that time to tote books and materials between my schools. The box part is fine, seems sturdy enough. However the handle broke as I was pulling the cart the other day. I sent an email to the company (dbest) on Wed. 2/24/11 but have not yet heard back from them (2/26/11). No phone number on the website."
3,Great until it started falling apart!,"Product worked well in the beginning and was very convenient, however after a few uses home from the grocery store filled with groceries etc, the crate itself was cracking on the bottom and the handle snapped completely off. Now it is being held together by duct tape and I am leary of using it as I don't want the things I am trying to transport to be destroyed."
2,Product is very poorly made and some parts have broken pieces :-) I'm very disatisfied.,"I'm very disappointed in this product - it is not the quality product that the seller claims it to be. The instructions for putting it together are inconsistent with the product. The product seems to be of ""cheap"" quality. There are pieces broken off several of the sections. I am not a happy customer."
5,I GOT THIS AS A GIFT,I GOT THIS CART FOR A GIFT AND I USE IT EVERY DAY!! I LOVE IT!! IT IS LIGHT AND FUNCTIONAL. THIS IS THE BEST GIFT! AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!
4,One of the Best Items to Own,"I bought this cart to replace one I had for over 5 years. It is one of my best purchases. I keep it in my car so I can get groceries from my garage up to my apartment. I also use it in the summer to take supplies from my apartment to the pool rather than carrying a cooler, floats and various other items I and my granddaughter need. I have to say that this one is slightly smaller than the original one I had, but I highly recommend it. It folds flat and takes up very little room."
5,Quick Cart,I have been with this company for little over a year. We use our Quick Carts all the time. They have held up well.
1,Horrible,we've had this product for less than 30 days. Use is light to moderate. It has already cracked and is USELESS.
1,Broke apart in less than a month.,It's ridiculous that the product claims to hold up to 80 lbs when it barely held 35. I had just missed the deadline to return it to get it replaced (did I mention we barely used the product-possibly only 6 times at most). The one we previously got from Staples lasted longer. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. This deserves 0 stars versus 1.
2,Poorly made,"The product broke soon after purchase- when loaded, it appears that a design flaw causes the cart bottom to crack near the feet.I was only able to use it two days before it broke. So, buyer beware."
2,issues with handle,poorly made major issues with telescoping handle they dont release or telescope evanly release buttons dont worktop dosnt fit well
2,Great concept - poor execution,"My wife bought one of these for each of our four homeschooled kids for Christmas. Our kids take some co-op classes outside of our home, and we thought this would be a great way to mobilize their schoolwork to take with them to work on while waiting on each other to finish classes. Within 3 weeks of use (2 days a week), the front panel has started cracking near the bottom on 3 of them (as described in many of these reviews), including one that has broken all the way across the front, rendering it useless. If this retailed for 10 bucks, it might not be so surprising, but since we paid $25 apiece for these, it's VERY upsetting that they are as poor quality as they are. BUYER BEWARE."
1,CART BROKE EARLY ON! COMPANY DID NOT RESPOND TO E-MAIL,"I was excited to get this product but the bottom broke early on. I e-mailed the Dbest Company and they did not respond. I would say that they definitely don't have ""dbest"" customer service."
2,Don't bother,I started using this cart at the beginning of September and it broke on Oct. 26. One side of it became unhinged from its adjoining sides. Even though this was inexpensive it should last more than 2 months.
3,Doesn't hold up to heavy items,"First off, let me say that I loved this thing while it was in one piece. Holds everything I need it to. However, after less than 2 weeks of ownership, pieces of the plastic are breaking off and the bottom broke in half. I was using this to carry my textbooks to and from school, so I made sure I bought one of these that had a high weight rating, but I guess for textbooks something stronger is needed."
5,Versitile Cart,"I love this cart for toting groceries and all kinds of items. I live in anapartment only a block from the grocery store, drug store, etc. I haul everythingin it. I even use it if I go to a store I have to drive to, but put the things init to take them from the car to my apartment. I live on the 4th floor, but we havean elevator, so I don't have to use the stairs. AK"
1,Piece of Junk...,"My son ordered one of these carts for his Mom and the cart broke in 2 days. Sent back. Ordered another cart as a replacement and it did not last any longer. Sent it back also. These shabby carts are not assembled well and critical parts are either missing or fall or break. Just plain Junk.On a good note, thank you Amazon for your great RETURN POLICY !"
4,Very helpful piece,"This is a very hand product, especially when I was recovering from hip and knee surgery. Collapses easily accept for handle sometimes sticks."
2,Broke quickly,"Loved the concept, was really excited to get this, and really enjoyed it for a full three weeks before it broke. The plastic is too thin and it wouldn't appear that the development team did much stress-testing before scaling up to manufacture. Try again, guys - the concept is great, but your execution falls short of the promise."
1,DO NOT BUY This item,"I have bought a few of this through the years and it keeps breaking down.I thought it was me, but even with light load the opening mechanism keeps breaking downP.O.S."
1,"Poor quality, broke after 2 weeks of use.",I really liked this Quik Cart but it broke after only two weeks of use. Don't buy this product! The plastic is cheap and cracked right away.
1,dbest 00-011 Quik Cart Two-Wheeled Collapsible Handcart with Lid,These are NOT very good carriers. They are NOT made very well and fall apart very easy. Out of the ones we order I believe 3 have already fell apart in less then a month and half and really school just started a few weeks ago.
2,HAndy Item but Not Well Made,"Very handy item but the plastic is very rigid and therefore subject to breakage if you bang into something. This item will not take a lot of handling and use; it's fairly fragile. Still, for the right kind of light use, it is handy for carrying items and as a mobile seat."
1,"Broke within 2 months, unusable within 6 months",Bought this cart in 6 months ago to shuttle Sunday school class supplies. It gets used once a week - from the car to class and then back to the car. The cart has broken so many times at each front corner over this time period; I've glued and taped several times and now the bottom is falling out. We've stopped using for fear it'll dump our supplies in the parking lot.
2,bottom broke,"I was really excited about this item since I work in 12 different locations. I put my laptop bag and files: filled about 3/4 of the way to the top. After 2 days of use, I was picking up the crate to put in my trunk and the bottom fell out and the entire contents fell all over the ground. I have had to TAPE the entire bottom so that it would not happen again. I would only recommend if you're not putting anything of value or weight."
1,Don't Buy This Piece Of Junk!,"I recently bought the dbest Quik Cart. It broke after my third use. The entire front panel cracked. I'm out $30!The Quik Cart is not only ugly, but unwieldy, hard to handle and clumsy. There are other wheeled carts and shopping bags around that are a much better product.I hope my review is informative to potential buyers of the shoddy quality of this product."
3,disapointed,"I thought I found the perfect cart, but I have had it a month and it is already breaking. The product ad reports it holds up to 80lbs, I do not think I had that much weight, just paper files, but the bottom has broken."
1,Fell apart after only 10 uses,Poorly constructed; plastic broke off or bent after only 10 uses; metal handbar wouldn't go up or down easily after 3rd use out when cart tipped over on a sidewalk.
2,Not for the long haul,"This seemed like the perfect teacher-tote, and I was initially very pleased. However, the handle of my Qwik Cart jammed in the down position after a couple of months (of weekend rather than daily use). I have little use for a milk carton on wheels. A disappointment."
2,Under Warranty?,"After a mere forty-five days, my quick-cart is broken. I suspect that the ""Implied Warranty of Merchantability"" would bring me a either a refund or replacement, but Amazon says I can only return if within thirty days, and I don't seem to be able to contact the manufacturer/retailer through their web-site, which leaves me in somewhat of a quandary. How does one go about exercising a legal right to demand a refund or replacement when you can not access the responsible party?"
2,Fell Apart,Lasted MAYBE a month before I needed to reinforce it with tape all around.Fell apart completely after 2 months.Cheap plastic. Not very sturdy.
2,Good concept but cheaply made,"I bought this cart for my husband who is a cub scout den leader. He would carry his activities for the meetings in there. Mostly paper, glue sticks, crayons and sometimes a couple of small games and a baseball or two for outside activities. It was nice to keep all of his supplies in one place so he could grab it and go the his meetings. The only problem is it is cheaply made and after 3 months of once a week use the handle broke. The lid was always an issue too since it never wanted to go on easily."
1,Handle is garbage,"The handle is supposed extend, so you can actually pull the cart. Well we've used the cart twice so far, and both times we spent about 5 minutes trying to get the handle to extend fully. Tonight we used it for the second time, but could not get it to work. One side of the handle feels loose and can slide up and down with ease. The other side seems permanently stuck at halfway. The button that's supposed to release the handle doesn't seem to do anything either. My girlfriend, who's barely over 5 feet tall, hurt her back having to hunch over to pull this cart through our apartment complex from the car.If I had saved any of the packaging this would have been returned after the first use. I will be replacing it as soon as possible."
2,"Great in theory, terrible in practice","I bought this to carry products in on business trips. It was great in theory - a box on wheels! I bought two, in fact. Both broke on the first trip.I know airport security is a bit rough on bags... but still. It should not be this fragile."
1,Total piece of crap,"Bought this in late November, completely broken by December 15th. I used it to cart teaching materials back and forth from school. The entire front cracked and broke off and it is now unusable.$30 wasted.My previous crate from Lakeshore Teaching Supplies lasted 3 years!Don't buy it!"
2,Eh.,"This feels like a temporary fix for just about anything you can use it for. It's not heavy duty and not user-friendly. It seems like the perfect solution for an aging parent who needs to haul stuff, but then they have to remove it from their trunk and put it together each time. And then the bottom folds back up since it doesn't actually lock into place. And the lid? It's not attached. AND the whole thing is bulky so you're literally rolling a box around. I also tried this for my daughter to haul her design school stuff around but she complained about the same things. What a pain."
2,NOT WORTH IT!,"Well... I've have gone through two of these quick carts and both have broken. I will not buy another again. I just hope I can find something the same size. It's exactly what I need but they are truly a piece of junk! They have Cheap plastic and are not sturdy. This cart was used to haul my jewelry cases around. After only a week, pieces of plastic broke on the sides causing the bottom to fall out. I had my father in law make me a piece of wood to fit in the bottom. Worked well for awhile until the whole front piece of plastic broke off. I needed it so I bought another one. The second one I had to wire together after the plastic broke. The bottom also broke out of the second one...luckily I was able to use the wood in the bottom again. Used it that way for awhile until the same thing happened. Don't waste your money on this cart."
1,"If you want to be injured, buy this cart","I received this cart a few months ago, and have used it exactly three times. All three times it was used to pull around about 20 pounds of supplies. And because Quik Cart is also advertised that it ""supports up to 250-pounds, and may be used as a seat or stepstool"", I also used it as a seat ONCE, placing my humungous 150 pound bulk on the seat/lid. Within 20 minutes, the entire front section of the Quik Cart's plastic box supports broke, spilling me onto the ground.Now, my main concern here is: what if I had been using this thing as a ""stepstool"", as it states it is safe to do for those under 250 pounds? I could have been SEVERELY injured, and I am 100 pounds UNDER Quik Box's maximum weight rating..."
2,Lacking in the Longevity Department,"I got this cart about 1.5-2 years ago. The wheel has always rubbed a bit, but I just put up with it rather than do the return hassle. It's supposed to support up to 250 lbs., but I have my doubts. I use it primarily for trips to the library. I homeschool our kids and we check out loads of books a couple times a month. Yesterday the ""hub cap"" on one of the wheels broke and it cannot be fixed. The wheel no longer turns as a result. It has not been abused, dropped, slammed down or otherwise mistreated. We load books into it, and roll it up ramps to and from the parking lot to the building. I am disappointed that this cart didn't hold up longer than it did. I didn't want to be buying a new one so soon. If a cart is going to toot it's horn about handling 250 lbs., maybe the wheels should also be be able to handle that load as well (however, I didn't have 250 lbs. of books!)"
2,Harder than it looks,"I bought this cart because I have limited strength and thought it would assist me in moving groceries from the car and other small tasks. When I first tried to open the cart, the side clips and support rails were so tight, I could hardly get them undone. This struggle would be enough to deter me from using the collapsable aspect. In addition, the lid doesn't lock onto the front of the cart for storage even though it is advertised to do so, and it also doesn't snap onto the top securely. From the looks of the wheels and axel, I wouldn't trust the cart to hold up well to any significant weight placed upon them. This was a bad purchase and it is going back to Amazon."
3,Missing part of handle,"It's ok but I think part of the handle must be missing, there is no top part so it kind of cuts into my hand and I have to push a button on each side to raise and lower the handle which is kind of awkward"
2,Broken first week,"I loved the description of this product but it didn't live up to the hype.When it arrived the lid was broken on the corner but I didn't bother to send it back.I should have sent it back since it broke the first week. The bottom came off the sides and while I can probably still use it, it won't close properly and I will have to fiddle with it each time I open and close.I had a basic one from an office store and it lasted WAY longer. Don't spend the extra money for this one."
5,Cybiko,This toy is the best toy i've personally EVER owned! Hurry and buy one now before they are all sold out!!!!!!!!!!
3,Fun toy - IF it functions - 75% fallout on the batteries!!!,"I just bought these on the $10 special here (5/11/04). I bought four of them and only ONE had batteries that actually charged. Toyrus and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling these with that kind of fallout.On a positive note, Amazon's return procedure is easy and they paid for the return shipping. They didn't reimburse me for MY shipping, but at least they paid it to get these pieces of junk back.The Cybiko site seems to be down and I'm not even sure if they're still in business. Even if they are I don't think they support these anymore.Bottom line is - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
5,THIS TOY IS SO COOL!,I bought this toy on 4/13 and I love it! It has a lot of cool stuff on it. I was flying on a plane and I took it with me. It lasted the whole flight. I love this toy very much. Thank you Cybico!
5,a very very mini laptop,"i purchased one for my son, and it helps him organize his school assignments, study, and with all of the downloadable applications, its pretty impressive for something small. im upset that i didn't purchase it later because i could have saved [$$$]. but its worth that much!"
4,Not a good toy,"I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this toy. My mom ordered 6 for me and my friends. They won't accept a charge. They would be great if you didn't have to have them plugged in whenever you use them. I tried to download a game onto my Cybiko and I went through confusing instructions for hours and I could never get it to load. We tried to contact them but they wouldn't respond. I'm not surprised these are on sale for so cheap. I feel so bad for the people who bought them for full price. Unless you want to buy batteries that are more than the toy, I wouldn't buy this."
1,DO NOT buy this for a child...or an adult!!,"This is the stupidest thing i ever bought and believe me i have bought a lot of stupid things in my life. you can only ""chat "" with people who are in very close proximity to you. i bought two of these and i would return it [...]"
3,It's alright,I was so excited to get dis cybiko but then came the problemsI didnt know to email i had to plug in da cybiko in my computer to mak it easy i coul've just used my yahoo account and sent a email myself without any complications of trying to connect it to my computer. I love the games but it would of been better of if tha cybiko had its own internet without plugging it into the computer. I hate the chat range because i never get to talk to anybody thay should make the cybiko a worldwide chat intead a 300 range. I cant even play a game without having to charge my cybiko. I thought cybiko was a computer itself i didnt know it needed a bigger computer to make it work. Other than these complications the cybiko is okay.
5,fun fun fun in the sun,This game thing is very fun you can learn from it but at the same time you are having loads and loads of fun!
1,"Batteries stink, no backlight....yuck!","We bought four, thats right FOUR (4) of these things, and not one of them would work off of the charger. When you do look at them (no more than a couple feet from a wall outlet) the screens are hard to read (not backlit) and it is hard to type on the tiny little buttons (even my 10 year old ended up ""fat fingering"") Maybe the newer version is better, but these were dissappointing to my kids, and that is not cool!"
2,boring,"this toy is nothing but boring beacause i wanted talk to people in the cybiko and organize some appoiments but no this boring thing only played games u cant talk to anyone ,and u have to be with a wire its not wire less.boring"
5,Cool Toy,"I really like this toy. It has a bunch of games on it when you first get it. It has a planner, a chat room, a calculator, and anything that you can imagine!! The only problem is that it is really hard to download games off of the internet. But it is possible. I think that every kid (and adult) should have this toy. It is SO cool!!!!!"
2,Fun with Bad Service and Explanations,"I just recently bought a cybiko along with lots of other kids. I messed up once when i was charging and now it has to be plugged in to work. Also, when you download the games, you have to upgrade the version or download a new one, after which you can't put it on the cybiko. I also emailed the company with problems 4 TIMES almost 3 months ago and they haven't redponded. I gave it 2 stars beause the games are fun."
2,Boring!,"Personally, I got sick of my Cybiko pretty darn fast. Sure, it sounds cool, with the whole chat and emailing thing, but the reality of it is that if you really wanted to email, go onto the internet yourself, because you already have to plug the Cybiko into the computer anyways. The chat sounds cool, but there is never anyone on. And I mean NEVER. If this toy caught on more, it probably could be fun because there would be more people to chat with. I know what you're thinking: there's still the games, right? Well, the games look cool, but the only one I found that really is remotely interesting is the speed biking one, and in that game all you do is ""bike"" down a track. Oh, every once in a while be careful, it turns! Seriously everyone, this toy is a complete waste of money. If you want my advice, you'd be better off just buying... well... something else!"
2,Me and My cybiko,"When I first got it, it was bad because it took me about 2 months to get it right and to download games from the internet to my cybiko but when it work I loked it. Also its kind of bad because if your the only person in the hole city that ha one than it will be touf and it won't work. I recomend the new cybico extreme. My cybiko it said that you can send wireless email ans even use the internet wireless, but only a few sites. Go to cybiko.com and theres many things. Right now myne won't work beause of the batteries I thick I tries recharching, pluging in the electric wire but it won't wor so by the new cybiko extreme even if its more expensive."
4,Great Idea!,"I have owned a Cybiko for about 2 weeks now, and I really love it. The games and apps are great, but there isn't much memory to hold a large amount. This device is a great alternative to Gameboy, all the games are free to download. My only problem with it, is its small range. For a product geared towards chatting purposes, a 300 foot range is not enough. I would rather just go up 2 that person and speak. But for large groups, the chat feature can be a lot of fun. If you're going to get one , I would reccomend that you encourage friends to get one too because its much more fun with multiple Cybikos."
1,The Cybikos That Never Worked,"I purchased two Cybikos. They turned on, we plugged them in to charge, and that was it; they were unable to use. The message on both was low battery. I've called the 800 number three times, each time leaving a message. I have never heard back!! I went to a couple of stores to see if the battery was replacable, not one store carried the particular battery. If this problem could be resolved, maybe I'd be able to rate the product again. In the meantime, don't waste your time or money!!"
2,I'd wait for the next revision...,"How can anyone type on that impossibly small keyboard with the unusual layout? Apparently nobody can and that's why they have to include a stylus for you to press the keys with! Okay, so you want this to download your e-mail? Well you've gotta connect the hard drive in order to do that. In addition, games are impossible to find for this thing.This is a very neat concept, but not quite ready for prime-time. Seriously...think twice and then hold off. I'm sure there will be something similar but a million times better in just a few months. This just isn't worth it right now."
4,Cybiko is FUN! - entered by my 9 year old daughter,The things I like about it is the games espeaclily Pro Pinball. Another thing I like about it is you do not have to take batteries out a lot because of the charger that it has. I think many people would like this toy. You have to be 13 to get the games downloaded from the web though...so keep this in mind when answering the registration questions.anji
3,Cybiko,Ok this toy is pretty cool when u first see it.But once u get it in yur hands its not that great.Yeah u can download games for free and even send emails to others people.but after the games get old i wish the chat range was a little longer.i mean come on what 350ft or whatever the range is.whats that gonna do. i could yell to some1 and talk to some1 better than typing those little buttons.however this is not a bad toy.its fun to play with and i think there is and mp3 u can by for it.so its not the greatest toy for chatters but overalll its pretty good.
4,I believe that I have a copy of this:,But it's not called Hot and Nasty on the cover as it's a 2 CD set of Humble Pie with a picture of two of the members on the cover and I haven't listened to it in quite some time and I need to find it and get it back in my CD player. I don't think that I'll sell it now that I don't see it in any of the reviews and it does not have 30 days in the Hole on it the last time that I looked. So the one that I have must be a rarity.
5,JUST WHAT I EXPECTED!!,"THIS MADE A GREAT GIFT!! THIS CD HAS BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR AWHILE. I WAS SOOOO HAPPY TO FIND IT, AND THE CONDITION WAS GREAT!!THANK-YOU!!!"
3,buena musica en envase pobre!,"humble pie fue un gran grupo, con un peter frampton aun inmaduro, y un marriot en su punto culmine. buena seleccion de canciones, siempre se puede lamentar alguna ausencia, aunque eso claro, depende solo de gustos... lo que es muy reprochable es el booklet..poca informacion, pobre material fotografico, aporta poco a quien quiere conocer a la banda, teniendo en cuenta que las recopilaciones son siempre una buena excusa para tal fin!"
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your time or money on this item. If you loved After the Rain, keep that in your heart, because this album is nowhere close."
5,Nelson Twins Grow Up Talented,"Their talent is evident in the cd - no copy cat of their father Ricky Nelson either! Cd spans feelings and thought provoking emotion that we all experience. The cute little blond twins have grown up into their own - no wonder they hit guinness book of world records as a family with 3 generations of #1 hit songs. ""A Girl Like That"" is just lovely with a great rockin' beat. You'll sing it after a couple listens and wake up singing it. Just sweet but modern. Buy this cd - you will relate. Softer edge. Good intro to the Nelson brothers. A friend of mine bought it at a concert; didn't even know the Nelsons and just loves it. [...]"
3,Easily Enjoyable Read,I became 'friends' with Idella through this book. I enjoyed the easy way in which she told her remembrances of Marjorie Rawlings. I enjoyed this book - a nice easy read.
3,Misleading Title,"First off, I am a big fan of this style of music...That said, I have enjoyed the CD in general. It is good, quality music. However, not one track can be called 'fiery' let alone live up to the title 'Folk N Hell'. I had expected something a lot more rockin', so to speak. I guess I'll go back to my Brother and Leahy CD's."
3,"9 Mos is cute and fun, but also annoying and unrealistic.","I like Hugh Grant. His facial expressions and exasperated Englishman's blathering is hilarious. I also adore Joan Cusack and Tom Arnold is a riot in this movie. Robin Williams is a bit over the top as the OB/GYN, but when isn't Robin over the top?!The birth scene at the end irritates the heck out of me just because it's so silly and so unrealistic. The race to the hospital scene is just as ridiculous, but it does offer some laughs. Overall this is definitely a must see."
4,"oh,well,it was cute..","i think hugh grant is a born comedian..his face is,like,so expressive..its a hilarious movie..and really worth watching,slightly immature but i guess that was meant to be..it was really cute!great work,hugh grant!"
1,Worst crap i have ever seen,"Bad acting, awful story ( even for Hollywoods standards).Can someone please give Robin Williams a decent role some of these days? This is an insult to intelligent moviegoers."
2,Williams manages to make this a two star flick.,"I can't believe that Hugh Grant did that little episode in the car to draw attention to himself right before this movie!In this movie Hugh Grant plays an arrogant, self centred, yuppie jerk (that's a real stretch of talent for him!) who, when his pregnant live-in girlfriend leaves him, I am apparently supposed to feel sorry for.The only person I felt sorry for in this movie was the baby. What did it do wrong to deserve such selfish, immature parents?Robin Williams is the only one who makes this watchable, but it isn't a patch on his other work.The fight scene between Hugh Grant and Tom Arnold in the delivery room was particularly stupid."
4,Hilarious comedy!,"""Nine Months"" deserves credit just for being a Columbus film. But there's more to it than that: It's outrageously funny, with the film indeed coasting on Hugh's antics and boyish charm, and Moore's radiant beauty.An aging bachelor (Hugh Grant) is trying to make up his mind whether or not to commit to his girlfriend (Moore) for life. Then, she spills the beans that, oops, she's pregnant! Poor Hugh doesn't know what to do, and therefore starts a roller coaster of hilarious one-liners and silly gags.The movie works because Moore and Hugh have definite sexual chemistry with a lot of snap, crackle, and pop. Plus add Robin Williams as an Russian obstretrician, Tom Arnold as Grant's doltish friend, and Joan Cusack as Moore's pregnant friend (one of her best roles since ""Addams Family Values""). Add a frantic Columbus directing, and you have a charming, hilarious comedy that'll leave you breathless with laughter!Rated PG-13 for frank sexual discussion, innueudo and for language."
3,"Every wife, woman and teenage girl should see this!","This comedy is hilarious because it's so true--the lines between Samuel and Rebecca are straight John Gray! But the best line, the fall-on-the-floor-laughing line that made this so memorable, was when Rebecca informs Samuel that she knows she's pregnant because she's missed her period. His reply--""And there's no way you could have had it and just not noticed?"""
1,Unfunny,"The story has all the elements of a funny movie, and there are lots of good actors around, but somehow it just doesn't come together. Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore are lovers? You've got to be kidding - there is absolutely nothing going on between those two. Grant hams it up desperately in an attempt to conceal the obvious, namely that he is not interested in anything going on around him. Jeff Goldblum wanders through the movie as if at a loss to remember what on earth got him there. And Tom Arnold is just unbelievably, unbearably bad. There are some cheap jokes that may make you chuckle and Robin Williams has a couple of good scenes, but even the slapstick is so poorly executed and overacted it's painful. A total, unmitigated disaster."
1,Buy Notting Hill instead!,"First time I saw this movie in cinema, I liked it. Then I made big mistake. I bought the movie on DVD when it was released and watched it again. After second viewing, I dislike it. Marty (Tom Arnold) is the one annoying me most. A man who is so insensitive and inconsiderate to others can suddenly be so sensitive when another man voices out his opinion about having children? Ridiculous! The only consolation is Robin Williams appearance, though it's not superb either. I give it one star or less if I could."
1,Warning! This CD is COPY PROTECTED!,"When I took this CD home, I was livid when I saw the copy-protection logo on the cover. I always rip my CDs into iTunes so the disc was basically worthless to me. So, I returned it and got a refund: no questions asked. Sure, the CD may be available in iTunes, but what if I want to listen to it on my iPod AND have a physical copy in case my computer erases all my music? Well, thanks to Sony, I don't have that option.Bottom line: NEVER buy any CD that's copy-protected. I love Art Blakey, but if you need to get any of his CDs, then buy any of his Blue Note releases. At least Blue Note doesn't copy protect their music, thank goodness."
5,Fills in a lot of gaps...(Maybe I should refphrase that...),"Think of this book as an the unofficial second part of ""Sin-A-Rama"". The former book outlined the history of the creation of the softcore erotic novels of the 'fifties and 'sixties. YLS is the story of the rise and fall of of the hardcore paperback novel.In between the history lesson are numerous cover reproductions and a few bits of the novels. The only thing missing was a checklist, but that can be forgiven considering the elusive nature of most of the publishers.This is a useful and interesting book on a forgotten era in American publishing. In addition, as we are currently living in a period of renewed assaults on freedom of expression, this book is also a timely reminder."
5,soccer balls,"thanks for my soccer table was exactly what i wanted,will recomended for sure... i,love them and no more to say."
3,Read Size Chart Carefully,"Read the size chart carefully! I am usually a medium, but would need an XL in this costume.I didn't buy the dress on amazon, and the retailer that I got it from did not have a sizing chart so I took a chance.I bought a M/L, and it fit me like a small or xsmall. I am 5'7"" and around 140/145 pounds. I wear M in almost all of my clothing. This outfit was TIGHT, really tight. And I know that go go dresses are meant to be short...but half of my butt was hanging out of the bottom and let's just say that the front was similar- not pretty. The sleeves were also uncomfortably tight and also too short.My advice to you is to order this in a larger size (or 2) than you would usually wear. If you're small - get the M/L. If you're a M or L, skip this all togther.The quality wasn't too bad, but definitely not high quality (again, you get what you pay for.)"
5,Timeless,Had a copy of this album in cassette when it came out. Decided to purchase this CD album recently from a seller who had it available. This first album from the Dawkins transcends time...Priceless music.
5,Can't wait for more!,"The first volume of the Finder series was beautifully drawn, and very sexy with intriguing characters. This volume continues the pattern. Though this issue has less sex than the first (though what it has is extremely well done and steamy), the story is more developed and makes the characters less two-dimensional. Yamane introduces a new main character, Fei Long, who will be directly involved in the action in the next volume.I'm glad Be Bautiful intends to publish more of this awesome series. Ayano Yamane's art is superb, Asami and Takaba make a great couple, and the sex enhances the story rather than being the story. Great, uncensored, Yaoi."
4,Great series,"Everything that Yamane Ayano does is utterly delicious, and the Finder series is no exception: it's easily some of the best boys love out there, and if you haven't read it, you're depriving yourself. The only reason I didn't give it five stars--which it richly deserves--is that the quality of the printing with these books is pretty s----y, to the extent that the details in some of the panels are almost indiscernible. Which is a shame, since half of the pleasure of reading Yamane's manga derives from her wonderfully precise and clean lines. All thanks are due to Be Beautiful for bringing her work into English, but I wish they had paid more attention to the production."
5,Used in a Dell Inspiron 8600,"I already had 512M of Crucial memory when I saw the price on this 1GB SODIMM (which is at this writing $200 cheaper than the same from Crucial and within a few dollars of the price of generic memory). Given the price and the guarantee I decided to go for it. It arrived very quickly via FedEx. I installed it next to my Crucial memory and booted it up using a CD containing a freeware memory test program that I had downloaded. After running a complete pass (which ran for 2 hours), there were no problems so I re-booted into Windows XP where it has run with no problems after a week of usage. I have disabled virtual memory usage in XP and with all that memory one of my extremely large programs that I use frequently starts up much more quickly now. Good memory at a good price."
1,more salt than mushroom flavor,"Minor's has changed their soup bases for the worse increasing the salt and starch filler at the expense of flavor. I bought some soup bases a few years ago and especially liked the clam and mushroom bases. Unfortunately, the manufacturer sent me a promo postcard years later offering free shipping and cheaper prices if I ordered directly so I ordered a bunch and the only tolerable one was the low sodium chicken. This mushroom base is useless and you will taste acrid saltiness before you ever taste mushroom. I use it in lieu of salt (with the bonus of an msg quality) in oatmeal, teff flour, ground beef and ginger pieces for a not quite Cream of Mushroom Soup stand-in."
2,An explosion of salt,"Thought it would be more inclined toward the mushroom concentrate than any other thing. So when I started the water and put an average amount, the kind I would use on other base products, I was startled by the amount of salt I found myself tasting. Yes, if you use a much smaller quantity it does have its redeeming quality but, really, if I wanted so much salt on a base I would have ordered Salt Base. It works in small amounts and do not get me wrong: I am a dedicated fan of Minor's products but while plenty of others are above average on taste this one exceeds the allotted salt limits. I remember having to amplify my creation by a ratio of ten more cups of water to lessen the salty taste. Somewhere in there, lurking in the broth it made, a mushroom flavor was present. Yes, I agree with the first review (2006) on way too much salt. Therefore, 2 Stars at the most."
4,Some Very Good Songs,"Having at this point been in the business over 15 years this is a surprsingly good effort. The title cut is a classic about losing a good friend far too soon. The other good cuts are the rollicking ""Everything In The World"" and ""Third Rail"" and heartfelt ballads ""Images Of Loving"" and Pinnochio"". Even ""Loving You Tonight"" although basically a Tempted rewrite is excellent. The other cuts are pretty decent also."
4,A blast from my past,"My dad bought this CD when it came out in 1993 (when I was 8) and this soon became our go to CD for family listening. Every time we got in the car we begged for him to turn it on. I had not listened to it in about 5 years and just downloaded it. Admittedly some songs lost thier luster, but all in all it is still a very fun album and it is back on heavy rotation for me!"
4,Bully; The Pits,"Great book, I would recommend it to anybody. The pictures and short stories are great. Buy it and enjoy!"
2,Not quite what I had hoped,"I ordered this as a gift for my husband as we work with a pit bull rescue organization and own two of our own. I was hoping it would be a great collection of photos, artwork, and stories. And while there are some fantastic images in there (especially the historical ones), there were several questionable sections. The interview with a dogman was the deciding factor in returning the book. Quoted question: ""Do you believe dogfighting is cruelty to animals?"" Quoted answer "" Not when it involves pit bulls, no."" There was no blatant rebuttal of this statement and I just can't imagine why, in a book about celebrating the breed, a statement like that would be allowed."
1,Condones fighting,"In one of the interviews in this book, the person is asked if dog fighting is animal cruelty, he answers NO!! That one statement ruins the book for me. This book only serves to perpetuate how the general public sees pit bulls!"
4,Suits The Purpose,"There was no such product in Australia and this wall protector really suited my needs. I play darts outside and need to put the dartboard and wall protector away when finished. The DMI Wall Protector does it's job, it's light and very easy to put up and fold away. No extra holes in the wall required, it just hangs neatly over the dartboard. Perfect. The join where the board folds looks a little flimsy but if you are careful with it I am sure it will last a good while. Besides, it is inexpensive.Terry WainwrightPerth, Western Australia"
3,Gets the job done but has desing flaws,The thing itself is great overall but has minor flaws that are problematic. There are spaces in between the wall protector as a result of how the product is supposed to be set up. Since there are four separate pieces of foam each with Velcro to attach to the Velcro ring on the dart board results in minor to major gaps. Also on occasion the darts that hit the wall protector come out with some form of adhesive that is difficult to get off the dart. Also the Velcro ring does not fit too well and hangs on the dartboard leaving a gap at the bottom between the dartboard and the protector. Overall it still gets the job done.
2,Save your money,"This product just hangs on your dartboard so it is rather light, not securely fastened, and can rattle around. Also since it hangs there is a small gap around most of the dart board. You'd be surprised on how often your darts will find this gap. Stops the darts if you're way off, but I'd save my money for a real backboard or cabinet."
1,Bad in a big way,What a let down first of all it didn't fit theDart board .the front was allWrinkled . And the board was very thinAnd cheap. And it was late arriving
4,Wall protector,"This product is considerablly better than other wall protectors for the fact that it is portable. So whenever I want to shoot some darts I install it, and when I finish I simplly remove it."
2,Not so great!,"Really too thin to be much protection (I had to add a layer of plastic-counter-type stuff behind it to fully protect the wall.The square shape is great for the convenience of the manufacturer/shipper, BUT does not provide equal protection at all angles around a Circular dartboard! A donut/ring shape would have been MUCH better, since no one can guarantee at what angle a throw will miss the board.I've got it, so I'll use it, but I personally would not buy it again."
1,universal rf adapter,This adapter looked promising!! But once connected it would display interference on the tv. I tried unplugging and reconnecting it only to have the same interference show up on the tv.
4,essential 70's sound,"The music reminds me of background soundtrack from our local 70s tv shows, never figured out who made it until i listened to this disc. im more into jazz-rock-fusion but this album didnt disappoint me. keep listening to it and youll keep on discovering new sounds. ESSENTIAL truly."
4,Did he ever make a sub-par album?,"Well, this one certainly is above par. I'm 22 years old and am now really starting to get into jazz from the seventies, coming out of study in bebop and postbop and am enjoying the journey. For some reason this album got me thinking about how much simpler life was way before the teenage years. I also played ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" back in high school, so this takes me back..."
4,HELP!,"I'm looking for the Motion CD by Deodato. There's a song that I especially love entitled Are You For Real. It's a great song! The rest of the album is just as great! Amazon, please try to get this CD. Your continued effort will surely be appreciated."
2,Not What I Expected,"I expected to hear a remastered classic, what I got was a shallow sounding, tinny release that came packaged in ""original style album cover"" that was a clever excuse to give us a cheap, flimsy digipak.... trying to turn a flaw into a strength can work, not here.I enjoy the music, it's nice to have a replacement for a 40 year old record that sounded amazing back in the 70's, so why is the remastered CD 40 years later sound worse?!I'm guessing the company would claim they 'remastered' it, not 'restored' it, but of course the implication is there that the music will be better quality, it fails to deliver."
5,Deadoto II,"Deadoto is one of my favorite artists. I love Prelude, but I have been seaching high and low for the Deadoto II album. No one seems to carry it anymore. At least now I know I am not alone in my seach. My collection will be whole once I find Deadoto II."
5,Deodato,"An excellent album of the Brazilian Born Keyboardist Eumir Deodato.Made with feel and a very good taste. The best tracks: Zarathustra and ""Baubles, Bangles & Beads"". Stanley Clarke on Bass. Ray Barreto on Congas. John Tropea on Guitar. Outrageous fussion Jazz from New York to the world. Captures the 70s feeling of the jazz&latin rythyms that were boiling in the city that never sleeps.Attention, you Guys at Sony: Why don't you make a double CD album of Deodato, including this CD, ""Deodato 2"" and a bunch of Bonus tracks and call this Box Set:Deodato: ""The Complete CTI Studio Recordings of Eumir Deodato"".Not a bad Idea, considering how happy Creed Taylor and the legion of CTI-Jazzed fans would be.What the hell happened with Deodato 2? Why Won't you put on stock!Javier Moreno buildingfactors@hotmail.com"
2,Intriguing Voice ruined by too dominant bass track,I was frustrated by this record. I wanted to hear more of Marisa's voice and quintessentially Brasilian inflections but the sound track was overwhelmed by a dominant bass line which could not be corrected or lessened with my equipment. Pity we cannot hear Marisa in a more typically Brasilian (and less American) environment. Incidentally her track on Cesaria Evora's latest album is magnificent and displays her voice well.
2,A GREAT TALENT IN BAD PACKAGING.,"Buyer Beware (who you buy this for) ... looks can be deceiving. I bought A Great Noise for a relative and am GLAD that I opened the CD insert before giving it away. The cover is kitch(sp) in a Betty Paige sort of way, but the insert goes overboard. The 50's style illustrations of couples having sex are TAME and perphaps humorous, but I don't know how well the full FRONTAL and full REAR illustrations would go over with your middle-aged aunt (or adolescent niece). Not to mention the depiction of DIGITAL stimuli and CLEAVAGE to CLEAVAGE contact. It's pretty much an illustrated sex manual and if the writings that accompany them somehow make them witty ... I wouldn't know,because they aren't in English. The insert really takes away from Marisa's talent ... there is an echo of Astrud Gilberto, Sade and Basia in her work. But, unless I want to send it in a blank CD case my aunt will never know. A GREAT TALENT IN TRULY BAD PACKAGING."
4,Still destroying everything in their path - Beautiful,"Napalm Death is a Metal institution. For about a quarter of a century, these Metal madmen have held up the Extreme Metal flag with pride. This new album does not stray too far from what we've come to expect from ND. Every element fits cohesively into a maelstrom of apparent chaos that constantly threatens to blow up your speakers. Barney's and Mitch's vocals are as enraged as ever, the drums, guitars and bass a fine-tuned unit of destruction. The addition of Anneke (from The Gathering) in one of the songs, plus some keyboards here and there, add a nice touch, but never, ever distract from the utter pummeling madness that has always been there in one way or another. In short, this is a solid release for ND, one that deserves a place in any Extreme Metal fan's collection. Long live Napalm Death."
3,Only for napalm death fans.....,Without being a devastating disk napalm death keeps the line . Its compositional structure remains predictable. It is a little redundant material only for fans of all the hours.
4,Grindcore to the bone,"I bought this album after recently listening to Napalm Death's ""Enemy of the music business"" album. It's Napalm Death the way I remember them and more. I would say ""smear Campaign"" is very similar in aggression as ""Harmony Corruption"", one of the Best Metal albums ever. Anyone looking to re-connect with Napalm Death will do well in buying ""Smear Campaign""!"
3,They did it again.....,"They did it again. Napalm Death has come out with another album that sounds exactly.... like every other album they ever made. The songs are the same format, same style, same riffs, same break downs and blast beats, in all the same places. That being said, I haven't listened to Napalm Death or metal music in a while, so this album is definatly a great fix. Lets face it, no one listens to metal for originality or for lyrics that sound like they were written by some one with an IQ, the same way no one watches giant monster movies for the ""right to life"", enviromental messages. So if you're looking for a fun little kick in the butt, or an album that will be sure to annoy most of your friends, this is a great purchase. I enjoyed it, so that means you have to!"
2,"Great Reference, but way to general and out of date","THis was one of the more expensive books I bought for info on the ARM architectures, but I'm disappointed, the book covers just the core ARM architecture and is a few years out of date now too. Its a tough book to write, no doubt, there are so many variations on ARM that its unrealistic to expect them all to be coevered, but I'd like to have seen some more specifics. Most ARM imlementations by the multiple vendors ot there put in a bunch of peripherals, I'd like to have seen some attemtp to address those features better.If you wanted a detailed ARM core reference, it might be the book for you, but bear in mind it doesn;t addres the newer products..."
5,It fit fine,It fit fine thought it took a few minutes of maneuvering to get it in right. Have to be careful.. It is glass.
5,Excellent film noir!,"""This story is based on true events."" -- I sincerely hope not!This very dark comedy is very strange and bizzare, in a Coen Bros / Hitchcock sorta way. Set in a rural Danish outback, this police drama-mystery-noir is a top notch production with great story and character development -- in a understated, strange way. Very well directed, produced, acted and photographed.I don't know how to describe the twists and turns this one has -- it's spot on and off beat. You just *never* know what to expect next. Did I say it's a dark comedy? It is. But perhaps less comic and more dark. And it's no wonder it's won numerous awards -- it's earned them. A first rate film that needs to be on NTSC disk much sooner than later.""The way people disappear here ... I'd better not say more."""
4,Coen-esque Danish film,"Very good darkly humorous Danish ""fish out of water"" film. As often mentioned by reviewers it has a Coen Brothers feel to it - the better Coen Brothers films."
1,Terribly Boring,"I usually take a lot of pride in writing a thoughtful, insightful review. In the case of this film, I will be brief.I will never saw this entire film because I simply didn't have the patience to watch it. I bought it to replace a copy stolen from home before I had time to return it to the library. Joke's on the thief... I'll bet he hated it too.How terribly ironic that he stole this terribly awful, terribly boring film from my home.He won't be back. He got the 'gift' which he deserved. zzzzZZZZZzzzz."
5,"""Roll Out and Make Your Mark""","Ted Leo's been around a while. First with Chisel and now with his own excellent band. This is a truly strong set of songs, with deep, thought provoking lyrics. They're also catchy as heck, with guitar hooks that stick in the brain for weeks afterward. There isn't a bad song on the album, but standouts include ""Little Dawn"", ""Shake the Sheets"", and ""Counting Down the Hours"". This is the probably the best album you never heard of and was easily the best thing I heard in the year it was released."
3,"Eh, It's Ok","I was a little disappointed with the album. In reading reviews I thought it would be the pinnacle in my musical search. I thought it would be a variable combination between Bad Religion, The Vandals, Lagwagon, Blink 182.....great musicianship in a pop-punk format. Although, I wasn't super happy with it on my first listen. The singer had a pretty nasaly voice and the lyrics weren't superb. I read good things about the bass, but (and coming as a giant fan of bass) it wasn't really prevelant. All-in-all, I wish I listened to the samples before purchasing. Even at $5, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Great music,"Honestly, nothing cheers me up like some Ted Leo in the morning. ""Counting Down The Hours"" is a classic song, just classic."
4,...mad good,"Ted Leo peps up his step in his new release ""Shake the Sheets"". Ted Leo's new album builds on his assortment of witty, quirky, guitar-driven pop songs. His fourth full-length album off of ""Lookout! Records"" is full of catchy tunes and ingenious lyrics to match. Leo teamed up with producer Chris Shaw (dashboard confessional [gay]) to polish off this one. Though this may be a great album in its entirety, Leo's previous works still go uncontested. The ongoing controversial war in Iraq and past election are prominent in many of the songs off ""Shake the Sheets"", especially ""The one who got us out"". I highly recommend this album, Leo lives up to the standards he has set for himself in the past decade. I more then recommend Leo's former mod-rock band Chisel for any of you who enjoy his sound. Leo is definetly one of the best artists of our time, spread the word niggas =(."
1,Awful book! Puzzles are retarded and absurd.,"I truly wish I spent a few more minutes looking into the puzzles contained in the book before making my purchase. The puzzles posed are not puzzles at all, but rather the end result of what you would get if you hired 30 first graders to come up with ""brain teasers.""Here's an example of what I'm talking about straight from the book:During a flight from Brazil to London, the pilot told all the passengers to get out of their seats and to stand at the back of the plane. Why did he do this?The answer is: A passenger sitting near the front had smuggled a poisonous snake onto the plane and it had escaped.If you think that ""puzzle"" is bad, all I can say is that they get worse, much worse.This would only be mildly amusing if I were back in college and wanted to entertain those who were drunk. Even then, probably not.Save your money for something that involves actually using your ""brain"". Purchase this only if you need something to reach the temperature of 451."
4,"Great book for learning ADA, but long....","This book is great for people just starting with ADA because it initially goes through the basics of a program and then going through every component in detail. Since I was already proficient in C and C++ it was nice how the book points out how the commands are similar to not only C but also Pascal and COBOL (even though I don't know those two). I really like the format of the book. You get the format definition, then the syntax, and finally a short example of the instruction being used.If you already know C or some other similar language, you'll probably get annoyed with how much detail it goes into at explaining the simple programs and code it presents, but you can always skip it.My only complaints are how long the book is and the price. Not only is this the longest programming book I've seen, but it's also the most expensive. However, if you really need to learn ADA it's pretty much worth the price."
5,Excellent reference source for Ada 95!,Excellent source for the details of Ada 95. Lots of excellent examples. I use this as the textbook for an Advanced Ada course that I teach.Mark Oestmann
3,Read the Label,"I was surprised to learn that this product contains grain alcohol and I wonder if that is, in fact, the most active ingredient in this extract. I will probably switch over to lemon balm tea in the future to avoid the alcohol in this."
3,Only tested once.,"This was suggested for cold sores. It arrived as a cold sore was almost gone, so I don't really know if it helped or not."
5,Great product,"I use this product in conjunction with the essential oils tea tree and lavender for the prevention and treatment of cold sores. If I apply the solution before any blisters have formed, as soon as I feel an itchy or tingling sensation, blisters never form. If blisters have formed, applying the solution heals the blisters within a few days. The tea tree and lemon balm kill the virus and the lavender oil aids in healing."
4,Heart burn city,"I saw this product on dr oz and thought I'd give it a shot. I'm a student and have anxiety so I thought a extra kick to relax before a test would be great. I would say it did help me mellow out and shut my brain off a bit, but my personal side effects made me stop using it. I have GERD and (I should have thought about this) but it gave me raging heart burn ;( if you don't have heart burn problems I wold recommend it"
5,Herb Pharm Lemon Balm,In my opinion Herb Pharm's Lemon Balm is the best. I have been using this product for more than 10 years . I started using Lemon Balm when I developed herpes simplex virus in my mouth. The pain was excruciating . The doctor put me on an antiviral medication but I had bad reactions to it and had to stop using it I was at my wits end when I searched the internet for something that would help and sure enough Lemon Balm was recommended. Because it was a tincture I could apply it directly to the area and within 30 minutes of application it started to work. As I said it's been ten years and I am still using it. Lemon Balm also helps fight the cold virus and so on. I thank my lucky stars for Lemon Balm coming in to my life.
1,Was told it would be calming and help reduce headaches,Did not work for that purpose. Maybe it is good and is used for something else. It did not help me though.
1,Not what I was expecting...........,Maybe this just works for some but it did nothing for me or my daughter. It was sticky feeling and the smell wasn't great either.
2,Didn't observe any results either positive or negative,"After using the bottle, although I as lead to believe it would have an ""immediate"" effect, I never noticed any."
1,waste of money,"TV doctors like Dr Oz and Dr Mike was hyping up this product. “Same effects as valium.” Thought it would relax me. This had absolutely no effect on me. Not just this particular Lemon Balm, I tried all 3 offered by Amazon. All 3 were a total waste of money. All 3 in the trash."
2,Gave it a try,"First of all, make sure that you mix it with water... do not try to take it on its own! Didn't work for me or my husband (that we noticed) I have anxiety, so maybe it seemed to have no effect compared to the medications I take."
4,Good and cracked.,"I would have given this 5 stars but the cd cover was cracked, I could understand if I had bought it used. The music is still amazing as it was in 1975."
3,Dissapointed,Did not have the cover shown and had numerous areas underlined which I find distracting. It was listed like new but they must have not looked inside.
2,Naah,"Despite the hyperbolic praise on the back cover--best war novel of the twentieth century!!!--I found this Ballard offering so tedious and unpleasant that I gave up on it just thirty or so pages before the end. My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__. If you prefer books about life in prison camps, try __If This Is a Man__ or __The Truce__ by Primo Levi. You'll find in his books the humanity so glaringly absent in Ballard's."
2,disappointing,"The movie was fantastic, and usually a good movie has a good book at its root. In this case, the writing didn't pull one into the story and let the reader identify with the characters."
3,WWII coming-of-age story,"Set in Shanghai during WWII, the novel follows a young British boy named Jim as he struggles to survive after being separated from his parents. Jim is crazy about airplanes and wants to be a pilot when he grows up. He admires the bravery of the Japanese soldiers and continues to idolize them, even after he is locked up in an internment camp where he sees up close the ugliness of war.Jim is not always the most likeable character. He can be surpisingly callous, but he is a survivor.Empire of the Sun is a well-written and realistic portrayal of a boy's struggle for survival during a brutal war. The overwhelming brutality was a bit much for me, but readers who enjoy war stories will love this one."
2,Alternative from your hardware store,Use a 5/32 by 5/8 Woodruff Key available at most hardware stores at a fraction of the price
4,One of Chicagos best performances,"Chicago at Carneige Hall is my favorite album from their huge library. The highlights have got to be: 1) it is the original band, 2) a great closing, followed by, 3) a great encore.Also contained is a great, emotionally packed rendition of ""Beginnings."" Also, the late Terry Kath, guitarist, really gives this performance punch. The only 'downside' to this album is probably its strength, the great early Chicago songs."
2,Virtue? Really?,"Frankly I was disappointed to find the author quoting ""Don Juan"" almost right from the start. Who doesn't know that Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan was a hoax? Even the most casual Google search should have brought that up?The Sorcerer ""teachings"" are really just a bastardization of Eastern Philosophy, Native American stereotypes and crap Castaneda just made up.Castaneda was exposed as a fraud repeatedly, first by American Indians and then by academia. Carlos was sued by his former Tai Chi master and had to pay a huge settlement. Don't forget all the money he made charging people ridiculous amounts of money for ""enlightenment"".Should this hoax and it's fiction really be included in a book about VIRTUE?"
5,Just the right size!,"Perfect size for those small, tough jobs. Got this to compliment a large pick axe used to dig holes, turn over hard dirt. This much smaller one allows an efficient, more precise use in small area for those tough jobs...like getting to the roots of wild berry vines located hiding amongst ground cover you don't want to harm. Very happy with my purchase."
5,A gardening tool I can't be without,"Great gardening tool, and one I can't be without. I love the foam rubber covering on the handle - makes it more comfortable to use. The pick on one end is handy for digging out weeds, and the wider flat end is great for digging holes for planting & generally loosening up the soil. This is my number one gardening tool. It seems very sturdy & well made."
5,when will cd be available?,I just want to put in my request to have this cd reissued. My nephew is crazy for it and I lost the one copy he had and I cannot find a replacement.
5,GREAT BLUES ALBUM!!!,I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN I WAS 16(I'M 30 NOW)AND THIS IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE RECORDS TO PLAY.I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM BEFORE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS ALBUM IS'NT THAT POPULAR.IT'S BLUES WITH A BEATNIK VIBE TO IT.IT ALSO HAS HINTS OF LATIN & JAZZ ALL KIND OF MELTED TOGETHER.IF ANYONE OUT THERE LIKES 60'S BLUES THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD.
4,A great cross-section of Stock,"This collection contains so many excellent recordings that I hardly know where to start! However, first-time buyers should be aware that the recorded quality is not comparable to modern technology, hence I have given it 4 stars overall. The performances are very strong and flexible, for example Zarathustra (only the second version ever made, I think). Tchaik 5 is cut in the last movement (as many conductors used to do in those days). The short pieces are all well-judged, and give an idea of Stock's great range of sympathies. His own Waltz is like Ravel's La Valse, quite sinister.It's sad that this set is no longer available. I would be happy to swap copies for other CD's of Stock, for example the Chausson Symphony. If interested, please contact me on prterry@terrt.fsnet.co.uk"
5,Torben Askholm great vocals...and great debut,"I have to step up the plate here, too. I have all four of Anubis Gate cds. However, I find myself consistently returning to ""A Perfect Forever"" and ""Purification."" I really like Torben's vocal style on these two cds. They band has changed their direction since Torben and are still an amazing band. But I do enjoy the first two releases most. Muscially, the cds are great with mid-paced songs and the riffs are great. Recommended, indeed. Torben is working on a new project called ""Stranger Tides."" If he does anything like he did with Anubis Gate, then I will certainly buy it."
5,This is a Fantastic CD,As long as Antone is still around the memory of Barry White will live on.He sounds so much like Barry that at times you forget it is not Barry youare listening to.Great selection of Barry White's song and some off the hook original songsyou will fall in love with.You can't go wrong with this purchase and will find it on your instancereplay list.Antone has it going on and has put out a fantastic CD for your listeningpleasure. GET IT NOW!!!
2,Mediocre,"What a mediocre offering by Ryan. She zips through plotlines so quickly you're in a daze. The heroine is typically ""plucky"" but stupid in her blindness to the slick gentleman who courts her and then quick to jump into bed with the sheriff. There's nothing deep here - no character development, no in-depth story, no real emotion. I'd skip this one if I were you."
3,Until the real thing comes along,"My favourite jazz drummer. These are all great tunes, but it would be nice if the original albums were still in print. It will have to do until ""Tokyo Live"" is released on CD.Check out pretty much anything with Tony Williams on drums including the second great Miles Davis Quintet with Wayne Shorter or George Coleman, Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter and Williams' ""Emergency"" with John McLauglin and Larry Young."
3,Sean Patrick Flanery,"Okay, yes I agree with most of what has been written in regard to the previous reviews. However there is one thing missing. The fact that there is an excellent actor in it & his performance is streets ahead of anyone else's. If you're a fan of Sean Patrick Flanery's you will watch this movie, you won't necessarily like it but you'll watch it because he is in it & anything he is in has value in it somewhere. So if you're a fan of his then watch it, if you're not a fan of his don't watch it. It's that simple."
1,Another Sci-fi Channel Bomb,"For those of you who have sat through more than one Sci-fi Channel movie, this is more of the same. Trash.For those of you who have yet to view a Sci-Fi Channel movie, I will explain to you why they are bad. (including Savage Planet)The dialog in Savage Planet comes off as if it were written by a fourth grader. It is clunky, awkward, cliche and trite. The special effects in Savage Planet look like they were put together by the fourth grader's computer nerd buddy. The effects are hokey, and look like they were produced for a 1992 video game.And the acting? Horrendous. Few actors in Savage Planet seem capable of expressing anything with feeling, conviction, or with a genuine tone. In addition, the casting is brutally bad, and the script is worse.Not much to see here. Please do not waste your money on this train wreck. And if you need to see for yourself, rent before you buy."
1,Dah Bears,"A group of intrepid explorers travel across the galaxy to an alien world to discover grizzly bears(?!!). Horrible acting, an idiotic script, and ludicrous special effects combine to make this the cinematic equivalent of bear droppings."
1,Please don't buy,"As much as I appreciate Sean Patrick Flanery, this was so bad you almost have to see it just to understand how bad it is. Even for cheap sci fi shlock, it fails miserably. It pops up on the SyFy Channel occasionally. Wait for it, don't buy."
2,2 Stars,I am giving this movie one star more then others have because it was cheap to buy and if you like cheesy syfy channel movies then this is for you.I enjoyed it because of one idea the movie had and that was giant bears.Have not seen many giant bear movies in my time but just wish the special effects could have been better.
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"I also stumbled across Kevin at a neighbors's party and was blown away.If he ever becomes known on the ""big time circuit"" look out.It ""does't get any better than this!"
5,An excellent debut,"I first saw Kevin Montgomery live when he opened for Steven Stills a few months before this disc was released. Montgomery's lyrics and melodies are catchy and memorable. Perhaps he hasn't become more famous as a performer because he's neither pure country nor pure pop. Nevertheless, his work is influential. In fact one tune on this disc was retitled ""Red Blooded American Girl"" in order to be covered by Juice Newton recently. Let's hope he can be appreciated by listeners as well as other musicians."
2,Good potential lost in the wash.,"The idea of recording direct-to-disc with no EQ and compression might sound like a great idea in theory, but in a case like this, where you have music that gets very soft in a big, ambient room that is recorded with too much ambience and too little presence, the sound can diminish to the point of nothingness. Since most of the pieces on this CD tend towards soft moodiness, you're left with a CD that is hard to enjoy unless you can be in a quiet setting with the stereo really cranked. Ted Alan Worth and the Girard College Skinner organ make a good combination, and the performance is certainly fine, at least what you can hear of it."
4,4 1/2 STARS-I really liked it,"I enjoyed the first in the series, but found this one to be way better. I have been in love with Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy for years, but I think I lost my heart to Gilliam before this book was half through. A gentle giant, Gilliam's patience and calm won the day with everyone and everything around him. The heroine, Nicolae, was tempermental and head-strong trying to fit in a male dominated world. I could totally relate to her. I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. The plot captured me, the character development was brilliant (not just of the h/h) and the love affair that developed allowed for humor, conflict and sweet surrender."
3,LIKED IT,"I liked this book. I do not know if I will read the others but the author did a good job of making the woman strong and self-reliant, while the man came off as being very human, showing feelings and insecurities even though he is supposed to be this great big strong knight. I would recommend."
3,Summers Storm,"The basic story line is good. However the author worked to hard to create difficulties for the main characters, as well as leaving plot threads untied. The family connection would not have been considered incest, and would not have been a bar to their union. The Lady was a bastard!? So who was her father? Her husband was sick & twisted due to sexual abuse from his mother? The plan to murder the Lady by her husband & his mother if proven to the Bishop, would have been enough for them to be put to death, at which time the Lady would have been free to marry as well as probably inheriting their estate."
4,Haven't read this book yet.,Have been reading a lot of books on my Kindle but haven't gotten to this one yet. By reading the review before I ordered this book I believe I will really enjoy reading it when I can.
3,OK,I've read the previous books in this series. All are fairly good. The entire middle of this book seemed to drag for me. I didn't really feel the connection between h/h. The relationship felt forced. I had problems believing Nicola could fight as well as the book portrayed. I will read the next one and hope it's better.
1,new haircut makes you beautiful?,"""Heroine goes from ugly horse-faced Amazon to a curly haired beauty with a simple haircut and transforms to willing piece of property....please"
1,dead end!,"this book was totally boring, wouldn't go anywhere, I got up to 45% in the book, and I was bored to death, nice cover and picture of the book, but absolutely no action, wake me up when its over already!"
3,AN OK READ.,"Truely, as tall as an Amazon? I'm just glad this was a ""freebie"". I found the storyline to be way too long. I had a hard time believing that a woman could work a heavy sword as well as a man. Sorry, but this book just didn't work for me. I don't think I will be reading the rest of the series."
4,Good,Good. Would recommend for those who like the genre. Quick and easy read. Nice to have as an ebook and would get it again
5,4 Part Installment,"Started with the first book, fell in love with not only the main characters, but the time period and everything else surrounding these fabulous stories. I like the fact that Denise did not create a continuing series, but wrote each story separately, so that if you picked up book three to read it first you were not wondering what had previously happened in book one, or two. Each book is it's own separate story, but connects all of the brothers. Loved the books, and I hope there's another series coming soon. Thank you."
5,Spring's Fury,Another great read! I loved the entire series and highly recommend this author. You fall in love with each of the characters.
3,Spring's Fury,"Although a good book, the author makes the same basic mistake that a lot of other women authors do - they try to craft a strong heroine and end up with an overly proud and stupid one.. Is Nicola really so stupid that she believes that her father was murdered?? Training with the men she would surely have learned that Gilliam actually let the man die with some honour after his treachery.. Not good at all in my opinion that she learned how to wield a sword but not the other lessons that go along with it like keeping one's oath to their overlord.."
4,"Romance, Humor, A good read!","I really enjoyed this book! It kept my interest, had me laughing at moments, and always wondering what would happen next. The plot and characters are well developed and the text really fit the era it was taken place in. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others. There is swearing and sexual references as well as scenes in the book too. I personally just kind of skip over them. Give it a try!"
4,was ok,"I needed much more than I thought, and unless you know what youre doing, consider 2"" rollseasy to install"
5,Great Book to have,This is a really good book to have by an Oracle DBA for Oracle 10g reference. This book will help the Oracle DBA to identify and implement Oracle 10g new features. It has good tips for performance and tuning and setting up ASM. I give this book 5 star rating.
1,Double Vision: What A Waste,"This horrible movie isn't worth renting. It's got a weird plot that goes nowhere, horrible acting and a bad ending. The slow-motion stuff and bad voice overs are just typical melodramitic moments in this piece."
1,A waste of time,"And when I say a waste of time I mean a COMPLETE waste of time. No plot, terrible story, bad acting and a horrible horrible ending, this movie was laughably bad, truly horrifying it was so stupid. Please whatever you do, whatever it takes, listen to me, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME on this awful piece of crap. You will be extremely disappointed. This is based on a Mary Higgin's Clark story, but it is nothing like the one she has written. You will be bored and confused. STAY AWAY. I really regret wasting 13 bucks on this shit, so imagine if you waste 90..."
4,Running with the Giants,Maxwell has done it again. He has put togeher a book that inspires and empowers people to press forward to reach new heights. It's an easy read and can be applied to life immediately.
2,Not what expected from John - SMPsolutions.com,I am a big fan of John C Maxwell so I was disappointed with this book. My expectations was of powerful leadership lessons and a relation to the bible. The was mainly like reading the bible which I already have one.
5,Riveting Account,"Professor Foster's riveting account of his various attempts to determine authorship through ""Literary DNA"" is fascinating and informative. As you read the book, you seem to make your own discoveries along with the author. This is partly because Dr. Foster knows how to tell a story and also because the field is so completely new he has practically invented it. I found both the chapters on his unmasking of ""Anonymous"" and the discovery of a ""new"" Shakespeare work especially interesting. Both stories unfold as good as or better than a well-written mystery novel. I hope in the future Dr. Foster will be able to enlighten us with his knowledge of the Jon Benet Ramsey case which he alludes to in this book."
4,"Very interesting, but a bit dry.","I found it interesting, but a bit dry. Also it did not seem well organized. Information was not in good order. For instance he told us who wrote the alleged Pynchon letters and then went back and told us the story and who didn't write them. Also, some chapters had too much information on how he solved certain cases and others had too little. But it was interesting and I am glad I read it."
4,Scholarly suspense.,It catches you right at the start when the author is disputed. It reads like a novel bent on making the edge of your seat the only place that you want to be. READ THIS!!
1,Charlatan,"Short and simple - the man can match photos of two apples if the light is on - put him in the dark and ask him to do a bit of detective work and the man can't tell an apple from a peach or an orange.How do I know? Because I have first hand experience with him!After he studied thousands of my messaages on the net, after exchanging emails on the Ramsey case, he identified ME as the killer - and revealed that I was, in fact, JonBenét's half brother - a 20 year old male raised in GA. Truth is, he was a quarter century off on the age, completely wrong on the gender, and I was born and raised in Massachusetts - lived there for the first 40 years of my life!The man is a charlatan - has been discredited in the Ramsey case, and is a negative in any discussion of text analysis!"
2,"Moore on Clement Clarke Moore (revised, more detail)","Give this poem back to Clement Clarke Moore! The book by Foster is missing the family connection between John Jay (grad. Columbia 1836, grandson of Anna Moore McVickar), Henry Livingston and Clement Clarke Moore. Would he have reached a different conclusion if he had done further research? Mrs. Van Deusen can claim to be related to Moore. Moore generation 12"
2,Pettiness undercuts potentially fascinating content,"I ordered two copies of this book, hoping to learn more about literary forensics, a science virtually invented by author Don Foster, but found the material tainted by the Foster's own eagerness to even petty scores and take cheap shots.Granted, the subject is fascinating and Foster's first few chapters regarding his investigation of a newly-discovered work by William Shakespeare and his own investigation of the writings of bomber Ted Kaczynski held my interest. One can even understand Foster's need to defend himself against the professonal assaults that greeted his early work, but as the book continued, Foster became less concerned with facts and increasingly interested in self-aggrandizement and cheap political shots. What started out as a fascinating academic work turned into an overly-long gossip column."
1,WORST BOOK,Stuart Woods was not entertaining in this book. The situations were over exaggerated. Only the last 1/4 was faily good. Mr Woods is loosing his expert touch at writing.
1,got it for a gift,got it for my girlfriend she did not get into it at all she might have read the first quarter of it and then collected dust afterwards. she said it was boring because the stories are too short.
3,ROBERTA ALEXANDER - A SUPERB JUNUFA,"I disagree with the reviewer of this Jenufa. The staging, singing, and dramatic portrayal are all excellent in the Jenufa with Silja and Alexander.Alexander gives a powerful and sympathetic portrayal of Jenufa and her singing is outstanding. This is the Jenufa to buy."
3,Colorite Self Coiling WRHC1200050 50- foot blue Water Hose,"On time delivery, look like as it described in add and photo, but to myself experience not easy to use as the straight hoses. Anyway I can use it with a little problem because of twisting hose ! Sometime I gave to pay for what I have Learned ! Good Seller, not his or her fault ! but mine ..."
2,DOES NOT COIL!,"I wanted a hose that I did not need to roll up and would not be strewn all over the yard. This hose sounded perfect. The first day I got it I stretched it to it's full length. When finished, the hose just sat there. It did not recoil. I have one of this type of hose at another home and it coils after being stretched. I will try to return though I no longer have the packaging. Very disappointed."
3,"ok, so so","I was initally excited to get this book. And I did enjoy the author's writing style, over all. But the actual dialogue between the characters just quite didn't seem progressive. Meaning, the characters communicated better in their thoughts than actually interacting with each other. If Boles intention was to paint her main character, Shawni, as financially dependent and needy...well she did a really good job. Although Shawi was a high demand model, she couldn't even take care of herself to buy her own clothes, house, car and not even the dog. Shawni should have taken that modeling contract, she sure could have used the money.And I thought the retreat was funny...too bad that doesn't exist in real life. The only reason that I didn't give this book more than 3 stars was because I didn't find the storyline to be anything out of the ordinary. The ... point it made was to warn not to give your entire identity & independence to someone else, ie: her boyfriend & mom..."
5,Excellent,"This book was good from beginning to end.There was drama all the way through the entire book.The book deals with the life of Shawni Baldwin. Shawni has it altogether in more ways than one. Shawni has a wonderful boyfriend that treats her like a queen, a beautiful mother, a very supportive older brother and a very promising modeling career. In spite of all of the good things that Shawni has going on she still finds time to be unhappy.I really enjoyed the book except for Bo's behavior towards Shawni when he felt she wasn't doing what he felt she should be doing and her mother's attitude towards men.Ms. Boles did a wonderful job developing each of the characters.This was an excellent debut novel and I am looking forward to future works by Ms. Boles."
1,junk,"bought 2 tubes...1 tube ripped out the valve before I got air in it, the other held for 3 hours before it tore"
1,Not worth the money,I purchased 2 of these tubes. The valves on both tubes leaked and kept going flat. Plus a regular bike pump wouldn't fit the valve. Not worth your money.
3,OK but the valve is not L-shaped -very hard to inflate.,"Bought as a replacement for a child carriage (Ted and Phill's). Works fine for over 2 months. BUT: the valve is straight, not L-shaped which makes inflating very difficult. I would think all such a small diameter tubes should have L-shaped valves - otherwise it is allmost impossible to insert the pump's hose."
5,"What can a person say, it is holding air, it worked","My daughter and I found it online, did the one click order thing, it arrived 2-days later. Changing the rear flat tire on the little electric Razor scooter for my daughter was a small challenge, but, we did it. I would rather spend my time with my daughter fixing the Razor scooter than traveling to city shopping for it. It would have taken us a minimum of 2 hours to drive into the city, find it, and buy it."
3,Shipping Problem,"Although the book was in pretty good condition, I received it almost 2 weeks after I ordered it. As a college student, I really needed this book for a class, which is why I ordered it a week in advance. Yet, when it did arrive it was already too late. I was really disappointed about the shipping."
5,A Fingertip Critical Analysis,Splendid! Beautiful lyrical prose! Deep theologyand wisdom. A tremendous reading and learningexperience.
3,Good Flashlight but they make something better at about the same size,"This is a good, bright flashlihght except the head of the flashlight constantly have to be moved around which is not an ideal design for a tactical situation as you have to use both hands to get the light to turn on. If you want a very bright flashlight thats small enough to go on a keychain I'd recommend the Fenix P2D Cree version. Its like a quarter inch bigger and has a nice clicker on the tail end so you can fiddle around with it with only one hand. I'm happy with it at least and its very bright and good on battery life."
5,Great light,I'm really happy with this flashlight. It's small enough to stick in my pocket so I find that I take it everywhere with me. And the brightness is pretty incredible for such a little light.
4,"...and he can write, too.","Joey Asher not only knows about public speaking, he knows how to write. Even a Geek Can Speak is funny and to the point -- it would be impossible to read this and not improve as a speaker. Even people who rarely stand up in front of a crowd will find it insightful and enjoyable."
5,Perfect for someone like me,Even a Geek Can SpeakI just finished reading Even a Geek Can Speak and I cannot wait for my next presentation! Asher really knows how we think and how to teach non-sales types like me how to survive and succeed in the sales and marketing side of our business.I loved the stories and the way Asher illustrates his suggestions. I highly recommend this book.
4,Practical Guide for Good Speaking!,"I enjoyed reading this book. It gives practical advises that are easy to apply. By reading this book, you'll have a strong foundation on how to give a good presentation on any topic.The great thing about this book is that the author does exactly what he teaches you. Judging from the way this book is written, I'm sure he applied his own principles while writing this book."
3,I like Hater.,"Being a major Soundgarden fan since the late 80's, I decided to check this out. It's from the bassist and drummer of that band, but whoever said this blows Soundgarden out of the water is insane. It's not bad of course, just different, and obviously similar to Wellwater Conspiracy, that band being a later form of this one. If you're a ""Black Hole Sun"" kind of SG fan, I assume you might think Hater is just weird, but it's a decent listen given the chance. It isn't as heavy as one might think either. Overall I'm glad I got it, but it won't be replacing ""Badmotorfinger"" anytime soon."
4,Why is this album so unknown?????,"This a fantastic, fun album.Those of you familiar with Soundgarden will recognize two members of Hater: Ben Shepherd and Matt Cameron. Shepherd, who wrote some of the more unusual songs for Soundgarden (""Half"", ""Head Down"") penned most of the songs for Hater's self-titled debut (and only!) album.When the band got together in the 80's, they intended to be a regrouping of ""Episode"", though after Shepherd and Cameron took a few years off to join Soundgarden they decided to finally record this album in 1993. Thus ""Hater"" was born, unfortunately never to be heard from again.More information is available at the band's (only?) fan site: downundershoe(dot)com"
3,Two Standouts,This is a very good record that contains two really outstanding songs: Mona Bone Jakon (a Cat Stevens cover!) and Tot Finder. Dig this Grunge-rock side project up and you will not be disappointed.Whatever happened to Brian Wood?
5,Rees Howells Intercessor,"This is one of those books you read and learn from, then get out and read again a year later, then again after that. I pick up something everytime I read it. Have given it as gifts over the years with great feedback. What a genuine and unique man the books speaks of, one who paved the way for many to learn to walk in submission to the Spirit of God."
5,"May we all seek to be used of God, as Mr. Howells was.","I read this book for the 1st time more than 25 years ago and have re-read it many times over the years. It is easy to read and understand and yet, with each reading, it so inspires you to move closer to God, be willing to surrender and do all that He asks, and to seek a deeper relationship of service. The tests may be difficult, as with Mr. Howells, but that makes the reward even sweeter!!If you seek an inspiring book, with the power of the Holy Spirit, read this book and let the Lord use it to give you passion for His work."
4,The book is an excelent read,This book is an excellent read. Norman Grubb really engulfs you into the life of Reese Howells life. He also describes his struggle with a Holy life with excellent details.
1,res howells intercessor,"Was not happy with book it was underlined so bad I could not even read the book, with all the writing.almost every line was wrote on in the book pages were folded over for marking pages.It should of never been sold.very dissatisfied."
4,Challenge for your heart,"This book will challenge your heart. It did mine.Not Only will it give a glimpse of the prayer life of one of God's mightily used servants, it will help you to realize that God is very active in world affairs today. The part about his involvment in WWII was inspiring and faith building."
1,Must have Doctorate to read this book!,"I am extremely dissapointed with this book. It has been assigned to me for graduate school and I dread picking it up to read assignments. I am studying for my Master's degree but this book requires you to already have a PhD to be able to understand it. I guarantee that in at least in every paragraph you will have to stop reading to look up at least 2-3 ""new"" words. This book was not written for students. I feel sorry for anyone who has to read this book for any studies. Good luck!It's boring and confusing!"
3,Sport cars,"Sports Cars by Sallie Stephenson is an okay book, but too short. It doesn&#65533;t have pictures that match with what the writer was talking about, like the Lamborghini Countach. There were no pictures of the Mercer Raceabout at all. I liked how the writer talked about old cars. I had never heard of the Mercer Raceabout. Other than that, this book was good for everyone who likes cars. Stephenson did well predicting what would happen in the future.There are solar cars and electric cars, but I wouldn&#65533;t recommend getting one, because I think they still have bugs in them. The idea of garbage getting processed into fuel for a car is farfetched.August 13, 2001"
3,Disappointingly average,"Despite getting the Criterion treatment, 'Thieves Highway' is really just an average noir that gets off to a terrible start with a phoney-baloney scene of family reunion and suffers from a weak crime-does-not-pay ending shot behind Dassin's back, but the stuff inbetween is pretty good but not outstanding. There's a good feel for the vibrant nocturnal market location and the driving montages are well-handled, with Millard Mitchell, Jack Oakie and a barnstorming Lee J. Cobb offering good support, but it's not up there with 'Wages of Fear' or 'Hell Drivers.'"
5,Awesome,"I knew that this album would be good just because the family background, but I had no idea the magnitude of J Moss' talent and creativity. If you know anything about his family you know that they all have a pretty high standard to maintain. I feel like he has raised the bar with this album. You can feel the presense of God with every note and key he hits. With this album he truely inspires us to praise and magnify the Lord. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!"
5,It was worth the wait!!!!!,"I waited 2 months for this CD. If you like urban contemporary gospel you must get this CD. When I first heard him on my XM radio, I could not believe he was the same person that was on Karen Clark's CD rapping. He can sing! The words to the song are very uplifting. My favorite songs are ""I wanna be"" and ""We must praise"". ""We must praise"" has me in tears everytime I hear it. Keep praising him J Moss! Can't wait for the next one."
5,Why did it take me so long to hear of J. Moss???!!!,"This CD has led me into heights of praise and worship that has resulted in lifting my spirits, leading me closer to the Lord, acknowledgement of His mercy and grace. I love the Lord with all my heart and J. Moss has captured the heart of a Believer who loves our Redeemer! If I had to pick ""favorite"" songs, they would be: We Must Praise, Unto Thee, The More I Think, Psalm 150, Give You More... and my ultimate song of repentance and restoration, Me Again. I guess that's about the whole album! God bless J. Moss for allowing the Holy Spirit to lead him in presenting a CD like this that blesses the lives of Christians every time we listen to it. God be praised!"
1,Dissastisfied,"I can't really write a review on the product, because I have not yet received this product, it's been over a month since I purchased the J Moss CD. Not very please with this seller through Amazon. I would like to have this matter resolved."
1,Poor quality,Received broken due to lack of proper shipping container and no reply to replacement of item ordered either or a refund. Disappointed!!! Bad business
4,Move over Hip Hop for some Urban Gospel,In a day and time when some of the hip hop/R&B music lack taste - J Moss' CD gives you that flavor but from an inspirational and spiritual side. My family loves the beat and the message is clear and inspirationa.
4,The J. Moss Project is da PROJECT!!,I really love this project. This man's voice is just amazing! These songs are the kind that won't stay out ya mind. There's traditional and contemporary on here. And even some worship. These CD is a CD for the ages. Aw yeah he sound just like a male karen clark sheard don't it!? They sound and sing just alike. They even do there growl alike. They have that safe growl where is Twinkie and my boy Tonex have that in ya face church growl!! Its awesome. But you will thoroughly enjoy this cd as well as I do. Enjoy!
5,I'm blown away,"This CD is so good! I am just in awe. It is just urban enough to move to, with more praise than I've heard in urban contemporary music in a long time. I am so glad I ordered it. This is going to be a great year for Brother J."
5,THIS IS NOT YOUR MAMA'S GOSPEL !!,"This CD is not for the closed minded set. If you like new , fresh sounds and beautful lyrics , then this is for you. J Moss has enough talent to go around and hopefully he will be singing on more projects for years to come. The songs are upbeat and there are a few slow tempo songs. Very well done. Buy it today, you won't be disappointed."
5,J Moss Is Awesome!,"In this debut album J Moss shows that he is definitely the called of God given a voice to sing and a musically gift to collaborate w/numerous artist and yet preserve and exude an original style that says ""this is for God from me."" His blends and sweet melodies, rythmic beats and up tempo groooves give evidence of his amalgamated background; innnovation of Dr. Mattie Moss and the harmonious tones of his father Bill Moss. His voice is the male equivalent to Karen, Dorinda and Jackie combined and his funky mixes give evidence to Kierrs's legacy of brilliant music and vocal mastery.I don't know what you're gonna do next James, but after this powerhouse release I know ""what-sen-eva it iuzz, is gotta be funky!"" Stay tight and live right. You got this bruh, in Jesus name."
2,Okay CD,"I think that J. Moss is a great vocalist, songwriter, and producer, but the only two songs that I like on the CD are ""I Wanna Be"" and ""We Must Praise."" The rest of CD was overhyped to me, but I would like to see what he brings next."
5,Awesome and Spirit Filled!,"I listen to this CD in my car, at home, at work, wherever I go. It is truly an uplifting and worship filled CD. I'm a contemporary fan of gospel music and J Moss is contemporary gospel at it's best! My favorites on CD are ""We Must Praise"", ""Work Your Faith"", ""Don't Pray and Worry"", and ""Give You More"", but the whole CD is nice. It's a CD that I did not skip every other song, I actually listened all the way through."
4,Great worship CD,"I really like this CD. I think I played it for 3 weeks straight in my car before taking it out. The first cut is a hit...makes you want to start jammin'! I really like a lot of other songs on the CD as well. I love the one with the lyrics ""I'll praise Him in the sanctuary."" Awesome song! It makes me feel blessed to praise the Lord! He has a lot of good worship songs on the CD which surprised me because I figured it would have a lot of fast songs. Some of the slow songs blend together, but overall, they are really great. They put you in a mellow mood. Of course the new Gospel anthem of the year will be number 4. ""If I was a drummer..."" The only negative thing I have to say is that there's a bit too much computerized vocals for backgrounds. I'm not big on that stuff. Overall, it's a good solid CD, excellent for a debut album."
3,Not what I expected!,"In addition to Rodney Jerkins, J Moss is probably the best gospel producer in the industry. This album does not reflect his production talents. I think he could have done a lot better than what he did on this debut. It's like he used all the reject beats for this album. And why did he use some of the same beats from some of the other artists he produced. For example #10 Psalm 150. The same beat from TRI-NI-TEE 5:7's Holla-(remix) was used. I expected some originality, but there is none on The J Moss Project."
3,"good, but could have been better","First of all, I really love J Moss's voice and how versaitile he is, but I was highly dissapointed in this cd. I enjoy the song ""We must praise"" and I also like the first song, but that's about it. I felt something was lacking on this cd. He needed to mix it up with background singers instead of his voice constantly in the background filled with computerized techniques. If I hear his voice too much, I will get annoyed. With a voice like his, he really does not need a lot of computerized enhancements. I am looking 4ward to a another cd from him."
1,J. Moss,"This young man has a nice voice, but no annointing. His music is not deferential from R&B and hip hop. It doesn't sound like music to uplift Jesus; it sounds more like music to pop your fingers and suay to the silky sounds. It puts you in the mood to ""get your groove on"" instead of getting your praise on. For Saints I don't recommend. Instead I recommend music by Fred Hammonds. His music is very annointed as well as his voice."
5,Truly Spirit Filled Listening Experience,I can't put into words how much this CD is truly amazing. I can't add on to what other people are saying. I could listen to this every single day for a weeks and still not get tired of it. You cannot help but praise God along with J Moss. He truly has a gift. You have to have this CD. There isn't one song on here that he could have done without.
5,Hands down!!!,"This CD is off the hook!!! I believe that Gospel music is the best music as far as singing, tracks and everything else. This CD proves it. God has the best!!!"
2,Didn't help me.,"I'm giving this product a two because it didn't seem to have any effect on me. My lymph nodes all over my body are always swollen and I've seen several doctors over the years who have no answer or treatment for it. I am young and have no known health problems, but it just annoying in general. I thought I would try this product because I read it would cleansing your lymphatic system. I saw no difference to my body in any way except that my bank account was $26 lighter. Not going to give it a one because maybe it does work for other ailments. In general I take a lot of supplements, but I have a rule that I don't keep taking unless i can see a real difference. This one is no longer in my cabinet."
2,"Predictable, flat and ultimately unsatisfying","First, a disclaimer: I'd been away from the fantasy genre for quite a while when I picked up this book on a whim recently. I used to be a big fan of the Dragonlance world, and perhaps I was expecting too much. But compared to how some of those early tales really affected me, this one just fell flat.While the main character, I think, was fairly well developed, all of the critical plot developments were telegraphed from MANY miles away (especially the traitor in Lord Bight's midst). The subplot about the bronze dragon, too, seems thin and easy to guess.Another thing that I disliked was the way the Solamanic Order was portrayed. In all of the other books I read, I gained a healthy respect for the order... in this one, I was forced to question their motives and simply wasn't given a good reason why they were doing what they were.Luckily, after reading this I picked up the great Magehound by Eileen Cunningham, which gave me faith in the genre once again!"
3,A boring series,"I was so looking forward to this trilogy. The look of it just promised a great read....but lead to such a disappointment.The characters were likeable enough & the plot was good but I was left with an empty feeling at the end. I've come to expect a certain amount of action out of DL books & this had so little of it. This was more of a plotical intrique novel which is fine but it could've done with some more movement.This is one of those books where the words are just crammed onto the page. The author spent too much time describing the obvious & not enough on making the plot more entertaining. Unfortunately, this was the best in the series."
2,"If you want to program CORBA, this is NOT your book!!",This book provides a high level view of CORBA. Too high. Too many details have been omitted for you to actually see what is going on. Might be good for managers - it is at least comprehensive.
3,OK - Not very good,"The book gives only a brief idea of the usage of Corba. Its nice but very brief. More information, if given will be of much use. Since a separte book on Corba should give more information, if the author should do the necessary."
2,sloppy technical writing,"This is technical writing at its sloppiest. Just for you to get a taste of it, let me quote from a section called ""What is a Distributed CORBA object?"" ""CORBA objects are blobs of intelligence that live anywhere on a network.""What is a blob of intelligence? A program? A register? A line of code? And further: ""... the language ... used to create server objects ...""The language changes to 'server' objects. Are there also 'client' objects? Are they different? You wouldn't know from reading this section. Note also that the section title refers to 'distributed' objects. Is this yet another category of objects? Is it so hard to give a clear definition?"
2,Instant CORBA Marketing Glossies,"Don't bother. This book contains just enough information to make you think there's probably something here but you'd be wrong. Some of the chapters are so skinny it's not clear why there there at all. For example Naming Services: Naming in a nutshell, 2 pages, How it works, < 1 page.The authors' declared pattern to the book's exposition, which would be great if it were actually executed to a substantive level, is to enumerate the service APIs and then ""demonstrate"" the use of the service. But alot of this stuff is actually very deep subject matter. Take Transactions and Concurrency, for example. Reading this chapter (15 pages) will either make you feel that you missed something big (and you did, it's just not in this book) or that you got ... (and you might be right on with that assessment too)."
2,Jesse Stone movies,I've read a LOT of the Spenser novels and ALL of the Jesse Stone novels. These movies disappointed me. The movies resembled the books in name only. Whoever directed these movies took a lot of liberties. They do not follow the story lines at all. I am surprised Robert B. Parker allowed his work to be butchered like this.
1,Tired socialist pap,"David Noble recycles tired socialist and Luddite arguments in this cliche polemic. The amazing thing is that anyone still holds these opinions in the face of recent developments.If David Noble wants to return to the past, he should have written his book with a quill and made copies by hand. He criticises the very technology that he uses every day."
3,Another one,"Another standard Holby novel: senseless death, many wounds, amazing recovery in just a few days, inability to let go of the past and accept what has happened. Two wounded spirits that heal each other. Nice, but nothing extraordinary."
5,Super Read,"This book was a gift for a ""Harley enthusiast"". He was thrilled with the information as well as the photos!"
4,Nice book with photos,This book was a gift for my Sister's Boyfriend. I liked it and felt it was a stylish history/encyclopedia of Harley's. It's a good value and makes a good gift.
2,Misleading description of book's condition by seller!!,"Although the seller stated this book was in ""very good condition"" the cover was completely bent, and so, the seller should have noted this. I was intending to give this to someone, but will have to explain why the book looks so beat up. This should have been noted by the seller, so I will not buy from this seller again!"
3,Not as accurate as I hoped,"Got as a 2012 Christmas gift from someone who knows I have a Harley, and I hoped for a good read. Fairly extensive, but I was turned off by the full page photo on page 6 (right after the Contents page) that is captioned as ""Beautifully restored vintage Harley-Davidson in Geneva"" that is clearly a photo of a 1998 or 1999 Yamaha Star Motorcycle Royal Star 1300. Note Star gas tank emblem, modern Yamaha controls, radiator and visible driveshaft to name a few clues to the real make of the bike. Not sure if this was just a ""put-on"" by the authors to see if anyone caught the joke, or if they honestly felt it was really a H-D. Makes much of the content and photos in the book suspect. However, many of the facts presented and the photos given are correct."
1,Broke 5 minutes after it was used for first time,Should have listened to the other reviews. Umbrella broke 5 minutes after my son opened it. The wires holding umbrella open are very soft and bent out of shape in 5 minutes. Now the umbrella will not stay open.Total waste of money
4,Sister in Seattle loved it!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister who lives in Seattle. She walks everywhere, as she owns no car. She has had no complains thus far, and being that she lives in Seattle (the rainy city) this is no small feat =) She seemed to like the fact that she can be walking on the sidewalk with friends and not be bumping umbrellas so easily."
1,Waste of money,"It broke the first time my wife used it--after two blocks in a drizzle. What a disappointment! It looks nice, but that's about it. Don't waste your money!"
1,"PVC IS VERY VERY TOXIC! I don't think these are ""cotton velvet""","I bought some ""faux leather"" curtains that look identical to this photo...however mine were PVC 100% which I found out is a very toxic plastic, and the nasty smell was so bad i actually researched it online, thats when i found out it was VERY VERY toxic....called ""THE TOXIC PLASTIC"" anyway, i really don't think these curtains are cotton velvet, as that is more velvet...and soft, not shiny and leather like like this photo shows, just be aware, ANY AMOUNT OF PVC IS HARMFULL to breathe in. Just a warning. I was not told it was bad for me, until i spent my hard earned money, and could not get a refund. I did not want to sell this poison to anyone else, so i shred it and threw it away after wrapping it w/ aluminum foil to keep the poison inside."
1,ZERO STAR RATING SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED FOR BOOKS THIS BAD.,"This is NOT a book by any definition. It's 90 pages are printed in huge type with triple spacing! Then there is also a significant amount of blank paper at the end of each and every chapter. So it must boil down to about twenty or so pages of a ""normal"" book. Just an issue or two of the ""Enquirer"" will give you more than you will find in this self-published ""work."" Save your money and run from this one!"
1,More a Pamphlet Than a Book --- And a Poorly-Written One!,"Wegner's ""book"" is all of about fifty pages of double-spaced, ill-written text from a guy who really doesn't have a lot to say about what did or didn't happen at Neverland Ranch from December 1990 to December 1993. Most of this tripe (which can be read within fifteen minutes) doesn't even seem to have a point. Take, for just one example, the author's description of a new elephant's arrival to the ranch:""When Michael rounded the corner of the security office, he saw the elephant. His first reaction was one of great surprise. He moved very cautiously toward the elephant. A specialist, who was hired to train and care for the elephant, was present. Michael moved closer to the elephant so that he could touch it.""End of chapter! What was the point to that passage, I wonder? Or to this sorry little ""book"" as a whole? It doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it, but that's the lowest rating allowed.I give it an F."
1,Didnt like it,Its ok but the guy speaks some netitige information about Michael Jackson and for that reason I did not enjoy it. He sounds like an unhappy employee of Michael Jacksons.
1,Greed,"When questioned of his motives of writing this book, he denied it was about earning a heavy buck off of Mr. Jackson. Hm...obviously thats easy to deny now because he never did make money off of this filth."
5,Juicy information on Michael Jackson,"Great information on Michael Jackson. If you are a Jackson fan, then you definitely need to read this book. You will know much more about Michael Jackson now if you read this book. I am so glad that I read the book."
5,TRENDnet seems to be a good brand,I have had no problems with this wireless PCI Card. I bought it to replace a Linksys that did not have MIMO technology and I am very impressed with it's performance so far.
2,"You only meet the mother and her family, Daddy is conspicuously absent","Is it too much to ask that books for kids about divorce present a decent view of BOTH parents, or, at the least, do not malign or ignore that father? In this book, the girl is at her mom's house, meets with her mom's mother (her grandmother) and we NEVER meet her father or his family. It would have been so easy to do half the tree with one family and then take the book to the other house and finish it there. What's so wrong with portraying dad in the book? I am returning this."
5,A SENSE OF BELONGING,"I think this book and its carry around cover might be just the thing under some child' Christmas tree.We all need a sense of belonging... and for the step child or a child torn in todays modern life styles this book is an answer.I speak from the back ground of Elementary School teacher, mother and grandmother..Life happensand an innocent child may have no way of ""belonging""This book allows the child and other members of the combined families to come together as one ..a family a heritage and love,thank you Marcy McCann"
5,"Elegant, charming book that opens a door","What a delightful way to present the concept of a blended family. Each page led to a point from which a loving conversation could take place. I remember my own confusion about what made someone a cousin or an uncle or aunt. This book helps solve the mystery.The book is beaufiully packaged which gives it great value as a gift. It has inserts where the child reader's actual family tree can be posted, explained and expanded. The book is a celebration of families with lots of familiy tree limbs.What a delightful and unique offering that can lead to understanding and the opening of a door sometimes difficult to access."
5,Chelsea's Tree,"I am so thrilled to recommend a most heart warming and timely book called Chelsea's Tree by Marcy McCann. This is a delightful book that I really appreciate and can't wait to share with all my ""collected"" grandchildren. When my husband and I married, we blended adult children and their children of various relationships and marriages. This powerful way of explaining the various pieces of the family puzzle is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!! Kudos to Marcy McCann for being so creative!!"
5,A definitive view,"What a great cd. If you are looking for a definitive Greek Music anthology, this c.d is it. With wonderful insturmentation, harmonic minor scales,quarter tone harmonies and great vocals. This cd is not a ho-hum collection of middle of the road Greek music. Each song has an exciting twist."
3,"Only ""master"" the basics...","Okay, I admit that this program seemed cool. It had the reviews to back it up, too. Anyway, this software package was anything but complete. With one conversational practice per unit there is no way to learn the language. After going through the program I tried the SAT II test. Nothing the ""teaching"" part of the software provided would give someone the skills to answer the questions. The program DID provide a great pronounication practice. This is its main strength."
1,Over-Priced,"A publication titled ""Mastering..."" anything should be comprehensive. This CD is not. It is a mere introduction to the Korean language. You would do better to buy a Berlitz travel cassette for much less money. The book ""College Korean"" is a much better investment, if you're interested in learning about Korean grammer and sentence structure. My wife is Korean and she disputes several pronunciation examples encountered. Unless you expect little for your money don't buy this product. It isn't without value, mind you, it just isn't worth what you pay."
3,Solid & interesting,"John's best when he's writing the fight scenes, whether physical or verbal. The background/fill writing is a little weak. I think the neo-con/conservationist argument between Bruce the Black and Edmund Talbot was funny.I think the Council Wars series has a good base. Technology so advanced that you can do anything you want. All humanity has god-like powers and acts like Greek gods. But I think John can do better. BTW, the dragons are a weak echo of Naomi Nowick's Temeraire seris, whether intentional or not. If you like John's dragons, Naomi's will blow you away.A good page turner and very interesting. Just not so good that I couldn't put it down when I got the ""lights out"" command. It never got down to the begging level. This series is good but it's not as good as the Prince Roger series. That was seriously good hi tech stranded on low tech world."
1,Buy a VHS copy instead,"While i am a huge supporter of this film of trailers, I cannot recommend this Dvd at all. The quality is sub par VHS, i know this because the dupe i have from VHS looks at least three times better than this release. I would have gladly sold my copy of this to the company who released this as it looks much, much better."
1,This Disc is Besy used as a Coaster,"I had actually seen this film at a midnite show in an old grindhouse, so I had fond memories of it. I had the VHS tape, so I figured why not get the DVD? Yeah, regretting my ass off on that purchase. Worse than any tenth generation bootleg, this tape sucks on every level, from the picture quality, the sound, dropouts, and the titles bleed off to the side. The tape source must have been found in the trunk of a 1980 something Toyota Corolla that was just pulled out of a junkyard. My VHs is pristine compared to this, and they want 19.95 for it? It isn't like they couldn't find a decent VHS tape source, they are right on this site. Another cheap out release that just screws the fans and kill any credibility Full Moon had. Spend that $20 in a strip club, at least you'll see something."
2,"Oh, Boy.","Charlie Band does it again. He takes a tape master and transfers it onto DVD. Don't look for crystal clarity here, just trailers and scenes from horror films that were released by Wizard Video on VHS in the early-80's."
4,silly me,the name on the box implied that there would be soup along with the matzo ball mix but...I sure didn't see any soup.what there is is a mix for matzo balls which is easy and came out quite tasty.But why is it called soup mix?
5,A Must Buy for My Daughter and Family,"When I unwrapped my first Yotta bar, I thought: ""here comes another granola bar"". But I was more than pleasantly surprised.These bars are good. Not too hard or soft and just the right flavor. I tried both cherry and orange and prefer cherry so far. Granola bars sometimes seem more like candy. At least you feel like you can loose a filling when you bite into one of them. Yotta bars by contract are tasty and as advertised nutritious. When I passed the box around the office, one colleague logged on and placed an order on the spot.I would feel comfortable including a Yotta bar in my daughter's lunchbox and handing them out to friends whose idea of a vegetable serving is a bag of chips."
3,Cherry Yotta Bar,I bought both the cherry and the orange flavors. Good for a quick snack. I prefer the orange flavor over the cherry.
4,Cyclops,"I have read many Dirk Pitt adventures, but this has been the one I enjoyed the most. It is an excellant book for a reader who likes to think. Clive Cussler cleverely creates a plot using suspense and many surprises. In this book you can try and figure out what Cussler is suggesting. It's amazing how Cussler can involve so many places and times to fit into one story of the Cyclops. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoy reading."
3,Too many fat man bits,"Cyclops would be a lot better had Cussler left out the long, boring sequences with the fat man. As soon as Dirk Pitt does something interesting, the story cuts to the fat man and it is really annoying. Quite good, but there are a few unrealistic parts. The main problem with Dirk Pitt books is that there are always boring parts that do not have Dirk Pitt in them. More Dirk Pitt and less boring men I say! Yes. Quite a good book, though. I reccommend Treasure and Flood Tide more than this. They're more exciting."
4,A par effort for Cussler,"Although this book contains all of the same ingredients for success, I felt that it was slow at some points and more unrealistic than his other great ones. Dirk Pitt is once again the man we all want to be, but I just wasn't swept away by the moon colony and the hunt for La Dorada. I also wasn't pleased with the ending. Cyclops is a fast and exciting read but fails to grab the reader's attention as easily as his past gems"
2,Poor writing,"A couple of independent recommendations of this author made me buy this book for my last flight. What a mistake! While the plot and the plot twists are quite good, the writing and characterization was downright awful. The characters were uniformly one-dimensional and at times I caught myself laughing out loud at the descriptions, so cliche-upon-cliche it was downright embarassing! It's about as credible as your worst James Bond movie. This will definitely be both my first and last Clive Cussler book."
2,Prose to make you cringe,"My favorite from this one had to be the fat guy's comment -- ""I'd be a rich man if I had a dime for every hour i've spent auditing Pentagon departments"" -- what - he doesn't make more than $0.10 per hour? In 1987? Give me a break. Yes, these are great page turners. But the dialog is absolutely horrendous.Shakespeare, he is not."
1,Dated,"As a long time Cussler fan I was deeply disappointed. Although Mr. Cussler's stories are quite often true escapism at its finest, the plot behind the plot was too inconceivable and ridiculous.The book is also quite dated, in that it was written during the cold war. To read today of the KGB plots and our paranoia is uncomfortable and boring.I am sure this book would have been much more enjoyable if read 20+ years ago."
4,Action adventure,Another Dirk Pitt novel that entertains with lively dialogue and white knuckled adventure. Cussler does a good job of making each book stand alone so readers can pick up anywhere and not have to search for previous stories to catch up.
5,nobody does it better then Clive Cussler,"nobody can write a book like this better then Clive Cussler. It has everything Romance,Mystery,action,and surprises everywhere. I loved it."
4,Exciting story.,I liked the way the author got Dirk out of the jams he created.I especially liked why Dirk has the bath tub in his collection.I have found all of the Dirk Pitt books and have just 1 more to read.Unfortunatelu I can read Cussler's books fasted than he can write
4,classic,another classic Cussler. It was worth re-reading. This one was back from the days when there was no co-author... awesome
5,This is one of his best!!!,"I have read more than ten of Cussler's books and can honestly say that this is one of his finest reads. Lots of nail bitting, edge of your seat action and the usual Cussler twist, but I have to tell you, I could'nt put the book down. Great job!!!!"
4,Far Fetched,"I'm a Clive Cussler fan. I approach the Dirk Pit Novels with a suspension of disbelief and go in to enjoy the ride. If you're a fan too, you already know that Cussler uses formulas that have worked for him many times in the past. I missed a couple of those easter eggs in Cyclops: Did I blink, or did I miss the Hitchcockian Cussler appearance?In Cyclops, the moon colony plot was far fetched and didn't have strong ties to the adventure yarn in the first place. It fit into the Dirk Pitt line in the same out of place way that Moonraker strained the James Bond Franchise. Nevertheless, Cussler never fails to deliver a story of international intrigue with ties to ancient mysteries. El Dorado was a gender-bender variation of La Dorada? Dirk vs. a Soviet invasion force intent on taking over Cuba...fun stuff. I won't give away the ending, but count on Dirk Pitt to give it everything he's got to save the world from iminent threats. Enjoy this one."
3,Cussler needs an editor,"I enjoy Cussler's story concepts, and the man obviously knows and loves his stuff as far as marine engineering and science is concerned. There's really only one thing I wish he would do: Find an editor at his publishers' who will tell him, Clive buddy, people just don't TALK like that. People don't talk in introductory adverb clauses and parenthetical phrases; more of them talk like Al Giordino. The only other suggestion I have for him is, now that current information and recent history have left many of his books in the 'past' (he 'raised' the Titanic in '1988,' according to his books' chronologies) he should do what Robert Heinlein did (with much success) and declare an 'alternate universe' in which the Titanic *was* raised (in one piece) in '88. Just finished reading 'Flood Tide' and his concept of how easily the Mississippi River could be royally screwed up, at least from human perspectives, is actually kind of chilling."
3,A review from a robot junkie,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with Mr. Maltin, although I'm biased because I've loved anything to do with robots since I was a small child. While the plot _is_ a bit weak, Crichton's carefully constructed ""world of the near future"" populated with construction robots, housekeeping robots, security guard robots, robot pets, etc. is one of the most realistic treatments of the subject I've seen in a long time. People who, like me, have followed the development of real robots and eagerly await the arrival of the world depicted in ""Runaway"" will enjoy the robots in the movie at least as much as the human characters."
4,GREAT 1980's SCI-FI ....,"One of Kirstie Alley's earliest roles . She does well . Cynthia Rhodes is good actress and stunning . Gene Simmons , what can one say ; PERFECT mad/genius villain of computer/robotic age . For the time period of our technology , robotic and computer props are STILL believable . Excellent work . Tom Sellick is less humorous than ""Magnum"" , but a great Hero , cop/dad .I do wish the nude scene and vulgarities had been left out as the plot and theme carry well without the ""help"" ""R"" rating approprite . Good guy meets WORST villain possible ...... WATCH and learn , enjoy ."
5,"A Creative, Well Scripted Sci-Fi Thriller","You know how mechanical things go awry? Well, in the future, when a robot becomes a ""runaway"", who do you turn to? Jack Ramsey (Tom Selleck) and his division of the police department.There are great gizmos in this sci-fi story, such as electronic spiders and bullets that have your name on it. Though, dealing with the latter, a newspaper had fun pointing out those bullets were so slow and weak that a restaurant table could provide protection.Michael Crichton did a good job directing it, though he inserted one bit on reincarnation that did not add anything to the story (you should expect a fundamentalist like myself to point that out). Cynthia Rhodes played one of my all time favorite love interests. Gene Simmons started off low key, but by the end of the movie, you could easily picture him with his demonic makeup.I really enjoyed this movie, and would highly recommend it."
3,Good story for what its worth,"This movie really isn't half bad, in my opinion. It's not going to stretch your imagination or present you with any moral dilemmas, but the film's pace is good - the plot moves along nicely - and Tom's sidekick/partner is pretty enough. Too bad there isn't any nudity (or at least none worth remembering, apparently) or I would've rated it higher. I was secretly pulling for Gene Simmons to kidnap Tom's love interest and give us an extended ""damsel-in-distress"" torture scene (always a plus in a he-man action film), but no such luck. Instead, we have Tom trying to de-fuse an unexploded bomb that's become lodged in her arm. Policing is a tough job for cops of the future, I guess.Anyway, it's good action fare that's worth seeing at least once, particularly if you like well-done robot props."
5,x,Product arrived earlier than expected and was as advertised-no problems experienced. Selleck is always good..
2,"You'll Congratulate Yourself For Predicting Every ""Twist""","What a fine movie to MST with some friends! I know some of these guys like it, but I have to AGREE with Maltin here. This movie is awful. You will predict EVERYTHING that happens, I guarantee it. Witness Tom's son, Bobby, in the most annoying ""performance"" in the movie. Watch as Gene Simmons glares and grins evilly while delivering dialogue like, ""Where the template, Ramseeeeey?"" Actually, Gene is the best thing about this movie. Seriously, this movie is strictly for laughs."
2,OK robot flick.,"This is not a bad movie, for all that it was not well-received either critically or at the box office. Tom Selleck is always appealing as an actor, and co-star Cynthia Rhodes is as gorgeous as ever as Selleck's partner in this 80s robot flick. This film was made when Personal Computers and the possibility of home robots (which never panned out) were all the rage. Selleck and Rhodes are cops specializing in robots that malfunction, possibly hurting people. The premise is a little shaky, but this is science fiction. Someone is trying to make killer robots, and therein lies the plot.With a good cast and a good writer-director (Michael Crichton, no less) one would expect that this film would be excellent. Instead, it is only OK, and it is hard to put one's finger on why. Perhaps it lacks the intensity of say, ""Blade Runner"" or similar serious Sci Fi films. In any case, I found this one watchable once, but not a film that most viewers will return to a second time. RJB."
5,A 90's classic,"Therapy? remains as one of the most underrated bands of the past 20 years. They have maintained a high quality in their music throughout thier existance. This is not to say that Troublegum in particular is an underrated piece of music since it is their most succesful album. The point here is that Therapy? has created so much great music in the lasdt 10 yeras that the fact that Troublegum remains as their most appreciated album tells a lot about the quality of this seminal masterpiece.Every household should own this album. If you own Nevermind, you should also own this one."
5,The Scoreless Thai - a Thai Youngster ...,"... who couldn't score with the women!And that in 1968 Thailand!But, his lot of thinking of how to get a Thai girl in the sack - he will be Tanner's best hand in this partially hilarious adventure set in the deep jungle of Norther Thailand.I like the Tanner series because he's sooo out of the normal - but his Asian adventures are the best!An Oldie but Goodie!"
3,Wire Book,"I liked the begining of this book when they talked about wire and different properties. It was a little too focused on non jewelry items for my liking. However, I did learn some good things. A lot of the designs were somewhat complicated and fanciful for my taste.I just think it's an okay book."
1,YUCK!,This woman can't sing! The song is good but her voice is awful. The chorus sing better than her. Save your money for better albums!
1,Donald Duck on Crack,"I'm sorry.I just don't get it. I love a different sounding voice,like Billy Holiday,Stevie Nicks,Rod Stewart,but Macy sounds like Donald Duck on Crack.This song sounds like she's saying,""I Blow Bubbles when your here."" Her next single should be the remake of Rick Dee's,""Disco Duck."""
1,Bizkit beats Macy!,"Although ""I Try"" is a cute song, I am more a Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Korn fan. Maybe she should hook up on the Summer Sanitarium tour. I typically am not into the chart-topping, teeny-bopping, disposable happy music that brings up the bile from the back of my neck. Let's see if she can back up ""I Try"" with something new."
4,like it...ALOT!1,macy Grey has a wonderful voice. She is some what different than other popstars. I try really gets you in the mood for dancing!
5,Great cd of various artists,My mother once had this cd and i love every track on this cd great cd full of songs from begin to the end i was looking to buy it again but it hard to find and buy
1,Disappointing,"I bought those and one of the plates was already chipped and when I was just placing the other plates in my dishwasher another plate chip.... I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED poor quality, DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY WITH THIS SET."
5,The definitive treatment so far,"Some have knocked this latest bio of C.G. Jung for not explicating his philosophy. But that is precisely one of its strengths! There are innumerable books that try to explain Jung's thought. Bair's focus is on Jung's life, told objectively, with particular attention to the many controversies about him that persist to this day. She doesn't flinch from such tough issues as his rumored womanizing or his alleged support for the Nazis. (On which point she reveals, among other surprises, that Jung actually worked as a special agent for the U.S. in Switzerland during WWII, reporting to Allen Dulles, future head of the CIA.) Unlike such writers as Richard Noll in ""The Jung Cult,"" her goal isn't to vilify her subject. Ultimately she pictures a man who was far from perfect but deserved his place among the great thinkers. A must for anyone interested in Jung."
3,A disappointing biography,"Although exhaustingly and thoroughly researched, this biography ultimately disappoints the reader. The book provides way more detail than anyone needs to know about the circle of therapists and patients around Jung. Yet, it doesn't provide even the most elementary description of his basic philosophy. Someone who is not familiar with Jung's ideas will learn nothing from the book, although those who are already knowledgeable about and enamored with his philosophy should enjoy it."
2,"Boring, Detailed and Hard to Read","I love to read about great people in their time. It's a great way to get at history. However, Deirdre Bair's book ""Jung: A Biography"" did not do anything for me. If you are deeply interesting in Carl Jung and every minute aspect of his LONG LIFE, then this book is for you. Frankly, I could not wait to finish it and move on to something more interesting."
2,typical Eurovision,This was Samantha Fox's attempt to enter the Eurovision Contest for the UK - but failed. The song is sweet but not spectacular.
2,Este producto tiene una falla,"Hace ocho meses compre este modelo y resulta que apenas una semana después cunado lo conectaba a la computadora de mi trabajo, de mi casa o a mi laptop funcionaba bien pero despues de un rato se quedaba pegado (con la luz parpadeando) y no podía hacer nada para evitar ese problema... finalmente, el día de ayer tras haber realizado la única copia de seguridad que le he hecho (por presagio divino) se daño. Ahora cuando lo trato de usar me dice que está protegido... no lo puedo formater ni hacer nada con el."
4,a book before its time,"maybe this book would not have been of interest in 1983 ,but almost in a prophetic way it speaks to the world today. a novel of the middle east,with the names and organizations that are a part of the news of today. this is a story of terrorism ,intrigue and war..a war that is new to us but has been going on in the middle east for some time. a romance and a tragic novel of war/loss and prophecy.from the sudan to saudi arabia ,turkey,egypt jordan it covers the politics,the war and the spirit of a people. this book will truly surprise you."
5,a must-have addition to any music-lover's collection!,"These 2 supreme contemporary jazz talents have collaborated on what will become known as a classic jazz record. Each artist graciously allows the other to shine throughout this incredible recording, but without over-the-top flourishes and histrionics - this is a pure, soul-filled jazz recording, a smoky smooth effort. All players on the album contribute, each putting their own stamp on the result - a rare treat. I cannot say much more about this work except BUY IT!!! A must for late nights, rainy afternoons and everything in between."
2,"Rhythm-less, slow, dull","I have just been listening to this album in a shuffle play with songs by Sarah Vaughan, Karrin Allyson and Johnny Hartman. Cassandra Wilson's performances are so much duller, slower and less alive than the other three that I keep skipping to the end of her songs when they come on.I am a tenor myself, and I find it strange that Wilson is singing in my range, but I would never sing these songs the way she sings them. They don't swing.I bought this album originally because I liked another album (Reach) by Jacky Terrasson, but this one isn't worth listening to.Do yourself a favor, listen to a Sarah Vaughan record, or listen to a different album by Jacky Terrasson."
2,Basic & Crude,"The techniques are good, but the patterns are crude and require a lot of finishing when the sawing is completed. There are other sources for 3D patterns,of this size and type, that need little or no post sawing finishing."
4,Slow but worth the wait,"Although the program does load and run a bit slow, I find the interface is so easy to use that it's well worth the wait. It has all the ease of use of Adobe's products, and all the bells and whistles of Quark XPress. Truly the best of both worlds!"
4,japanese made easy,I am using this book and feel that it is very helpful but I can't get the CD to work.
5,Japanese in 10 minutes a day,"I really like this book, it's a good place to start while learning a new language. It teaches the basic words and phrases that are very helpful if you plan to visit a foreign country. The attached CD is also very useful for beginners (I just wish there were more of them included). The book contains exercises, games, quizes, flash cards and sticky lables for building vocabulary. It's like a school workbook but more interesting and with better explanations."
2,"Nice Looking, Poor Quality","My wife is an Oregon alumni, so I thought it would be neat for our 50 pound dog. The collar looks very good, but with even a slight tug from the dog, will not stay tight. I've needed to tighten it up after every walk, which, needless to say, gets quite annoying. I haven't had this problem with other collars like this, so I'm not really sure why this one does this. Hopefully they can make a far more sturdy collar in the future, because this one is only good for use on game day."
5,ladhybug,"Jackie & Me (Baseball Card Adventures)This is a wonderful story that you can share with your child. My daughter's 5th grade class read this book and I purchased a copy for each of the reading groups to share. Share an adventure, share a story, share a book. Read with your family No Matter What The Age!"
2,not recommended,The book was about a boy who could use baseball cards to go back in time. In this story the boy goes back in time to see Jackie Robinson because he has to do a report on a famous African-American and he chose Jackie Robinson. Sometimes he thinks of what other people are treated like and sometimes he wants to see what they were treated like by dreaming of him being treated like them and ends up looking like the other person.
5,Jackie & Me,"I purchased the book as a gift for my children. They love the series and have all of them. I highly recommend the series. It engages the minds of the readers in a fictional, imaginative way for those avid baseball lovers."
3,Character-driven plot has disappointing ending,"""Sparkling Cyanide"" has all the elements of Christie's best books: well-drawn characters which are introduced in a clever, unusual way (each relates his or her memories of the dead Rosemary in a separate chapter), a strong plot, and more motive than usual. Unfortunately the mystery's solution is so completely contrived and unrealistic that it ruins the rest of the book. Definitely a must-read for the Christie style, but don't be surprised at the hokey solution."
4,NOT TOO BAD,"This is an okay book. I guess I missed my fave detective, Poirot, but otherwise it's not too bad. The way the mystery is solved, by just a chance occurance, is so realistic that those who hated ""The Big Four"" for it's lack of realism will appreciate this edition from Dame Agatha.In fact, the whole book is full of realism, excepting how the murderer chose to claim its victims. I guess the realism is the deciding factor for this book. Did you like ""The Big Four"", or do you prefer the who-dun-its? This isn't the best, but it's far from the worst!!!"
5,Chilling!,"First of all: I absolutely LOVE the cover and title of this book, which was a huge factor in why I decided to buy this book out of Agatha Christie's many murder mysteries. It was excellent. In classic Agatha Christie style, the plot twists and turns until you just have no idea where she's going. I must have changed my mind about who was the killer around 5 or 6 times! I know I suspected literally every person in the book at least once. Agatha Christie is a master writer - I can't get enough of her. If you're looking for more recommendations of her books, (there are so many it's hard to know where to start) I very strongly suggest ""The murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and ""And Then There Were None"". You will never in a million years figure out the criminal in Roger Ackroyd (your surprise will be absolute!) and And Then There Were None is one of the most chilling Agatha Christies I've read."
2,Version 666?,"I have had System Mechanic since it came out. Every new major version, 4 & 5 most notably, have had initial release issues, but version 6 just takes the cake.I tried to install it on an IBM ThinkPad running Windows 2000...blue screen and circular reboot of death. Next, an HP Athlon XP with Windows XP Pro. It installed, but as several others have commented, it ""reports"" the machine as slow or fair in safety. It can't ""see"" the Windows Firewall or the hardware firewall upstream at all. And apparently, any anti-virus scanner but theirs is invisible as well.Tried it on another HP desktop with a P4 CPU. Horrible ""reboot of death"" as well.On my Compaq laptop (also P4) running XP Pro, it installed and ran fairly well with the exception of dubious reports.All in all, I am considering asking for a refund of my upgrade fee. This is unacceptable."
1,Buyer Beware,"I wish I had read the reviews. I downloaded the trial version of this software and it has ruined my internet connection. After installing it, I could not get my wireless to work, period. After uninstalling and restorting to a earlier point, I have wireless access again, but it is extremely slow. Speeds are clocked at 101.8 kbps versus the 1340+ I was getting before. I have tried various fixes and doing another system restore to a month before to no avail. At this point I am going to wipe my system and reformat, as their tech support has not gotten back to me. This software is terrible and would not give it to my worst enemy. Would give minus stars if possible. Shame on Ioio for making such a subpar product."
1,Worst Software I Ever Used,"I downloaded M6 and it started doing it's thing without even asking me. AFter it went through some basic changes I went ahead and click to correct the problems it found. I was getting ready to log on to the internet to register it, until I found out I no longer had internet service. No matter what I did I could not get my e-mail or internet connection. It's a good thing win XP lets you go back a few days to restore your system before downloading M6. I will wait for a patch or new version, because this one over fix problems."
1,Would not refer anyone to this program,"I was sold this program by Dell after having several issues with my xps 1530 laptop. It is running Windows Vista and System Mech Pro 10. At the onset the program seemed to work great. However, after owning this program for about six months, it has started to remove key items off of my computer. For example, I was recently trying to install a few items (adobe update of some sort) and windows came back with a ""windows installer access error"". I then did a little research online to find help on the issue and stumbled on a link where people where talking about how System Mech Pro will remove important services out of the windows configuration. This was supposed to be the program that fixed the issues before you had them and not give you additional issues. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,IOLO System Mechanic 10,I do NOT recommend System Mechanic. The application deletes necessary files for McAfee. Their technicians assured me over a month that the problem would be corrected ... it was not. I need virus protection more than I need their application.
3,This was a great package bundled with Kaspersky AV & Kaspersky Firewall since then... DOWN HILL,"This was a great way with rebates to get Kaspersky AV & a Kaspersky Firewall bundled.That's was the GREAT PART. The bad part... I had to go through & reset every scan / option to not do anything automatically. In one case after letting it ""remove items it deemed safe to do so"" i had to use system restore.This is a HUGE problem with programs like this or registry ""cleaners""Also while making lofty claims of better defragmentation... it was no better than windows in Safe mode."
5,Don't Get Your Hopes Too High,"You likely won't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very ""messy"" system. But it does have a great antivirus and firewall, and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on ""behind the scenes"", it's an okay product. But be very careful with the cleanup tool. It will delete some important files if you are not careful!!!"
1,a disaster from a good company,"Previous versions of System Mechanic have been excellent, version 6 is terrible. Avoid this at all costs. One can only wonder what has gone wrong at Iolo. Most of the features hardly work or cause major problems, The software sets a new bar for the the term ""resource hog"""
1,Highly Recomended - BUT Terrible New Version!,"This product was highly recommended so I bought it and discovered like so many others that it's full of bugs. Perhaps earlier versions were fine, but this one is awful... it hangs almost every time I use it. Always says that work needs to be done when it just finishing doing what it was supposed to do in the first place and support doesn't answer the phones. When you send an email, they give you the same answer every time that please check back for upgrades. I've checked back for the last 10 days and there are none so the problems must be serious. I'd stay away from this until they work out the bugs. No money back from this company either (or just the promise that there even is a problem and a date they expect it fixed) - they do not stand behind the product."
1,"Crashed my computer, DO NOT USE","This program crashed my computer into a fatal error. I lost everything. i was able to fix the computer with a total factory reset but it was the worst PC decision I ever made was buying this. DO NOT USE, Don't make the mistake I did."
5,Worth Every Penny,System Machanic 6 Pro is easy to use and really helps speed things up.I would recomendthis program for every user.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I've used previous versions of this product and have thought them to be a little better than adequate. However, this version is extraordinarily poor in that VERY little information about what it is doing or about to do is provided before changes are made to your system. Iolo's product management team that allowed this debacle to be released should be fired. I've uninstalled it and suggest you stay away."
1,Like blue screens? Then this one's for you!,"Usually mechanics fix things. In the case of System Mechanic 6 the idea seems to be to un-fix things. This software is buggier than a bait store and a waste of cash at best. At worst it's a system destroyer.I installed this on a new, fast, powerful laptop and found it to be a complete disaster. Luckily, I always back-up all my info and since this was a new machine reinstalling Windows was but a mere nuisance. If anyone has plans to install this dog on a machine that's not backed-up and has info you care about, consider yourself warned.On a positive note, I found customer service helpful. They answered my questions quickly and tried to remedy the situations as they arose. My guess is they're saddled with a terrible product. Suggesting users revert to earlier versions of the software is proof enough of the troubles.I must say this is the first Windows software to ever cause me to reinstall from scratch. Glad I didn't lose anything! Buyers beware and back-up."
1,Good but a fatal flaw,"Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.However, the ""repair broken shortcuts"" function does not work properly.For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File system. System Mechanic ""repaired broken shortcuts"" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target. Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences, since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever."
1,"Actually, zero stars","Why buy Iolo System Mechanic when you can get malware for free?I installed Pro 7 and it gave many, many problems. Iolo did not respond to my emails so I uninstalled. Their uninstaller did not work either."
1,Don't Upgrade to Version 7!!!!!,"Version 7 is a piece of junk. Slows the boot time to nearly 5 minutes. Internet cleanup completely ignores your settings for cookie removal...deletes them all no matter how many times you ""protect"" the ones you want to keep. Does not recognize Zone Labs Internet Security Suite's firewall or antivirus. Stay with version 6 if you must use an Iolo product. As for me, I'm in the market for a reliable product."
1,NEEDS A COMPLETE OVER-HAUL,"Had version 5 which worked fine, upgraded to version 6 professional which turned out to be a big mistake !! It consistently reports ""Speed"" and ""Fitness"" needs to be repaired, even after I have the Syetem Mechanic (allegedly) make the repairs.. Also, when I run the ""PC total care"" it consistently hangs-up and freezes. In addition, Tech support appears to be working part-time, I never get a response to the problems I'm having. Another thing is that the :""Virus Protection"" will not install with ""Norton"" installed on your computer.."
1,Version p is improved,"Version p I just downloaded is improved from the CD I bought on Amazon when 6 first came out. Blue screen of death I got as soon as I installed 6 (each of 3 times) hasn't come up with version p. Accepting repair recommendations no longer results in repeated notices to repair -- everything 6 rates in my computer shows up ""good"" now. 6's making repairs but not giving any information about what it has repaired continues, and is unacceptable. After getting no useful Iolo tech response for a month, I got a good one within hours after posting a review this replaces. I still want an update that gets 6 to show what it's repairing."
1,Garbage!!,I've used SM4 and SM5 and liked what they could do for me so i was glad to get SM6. What a mistake. Its big and bloated and at times made my computer unusable. I even tried disabling alot of the options but that didnt help. Dont waste your time with this software.btw the way....1 star is way too high of a rating for this product
1,Worthless--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"This product failed twice on me. My computer stopped recognizing it within a month of purchase. Verbatim sent me another. This one worked long enough to be out of warranty and then stopped being recognized by my computer or any computer. I tried various things to format it, etc. Nothing worked. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,truth or what?,"Missed this flick since I live in a culturally deprived city in NJ (2nd largest), and was always interested in this cultural phen. My interest led me to book research: Berbier/Castratos in French with s so-so translation in English. On to the review:Very good 'costume drama', evocative sets, imaginatively designed but parts were acted at times a bit woodenly. Overall, enjoyed it but to hear the vocal range one should listen to a CD.What I was looking for was to hear the vocal range of 3 to 4 octaves similar to the violin. Recommended for cultural curiosity"
2,"Terrible movie, incredible music","There are too many inaccuracies in this movie that I cannot even count them! In addition, the plot was terrible, the casting was awkward, and the sex scenes unnecessary. This cannot be called a 'period movie.'For anyone who knows anything about castrati, they would never have looked like Stefano Dionisi (masculine and angular. Farinelli was called 'il ragazzo' (the boy) on account of his childlike appearance. Also, his lip-syncing with the audio track was perpetually ill-timed (though acceptable for a non-musician) and distracting.However, even though I feel the artistic merit of this movie is negligible, the soundtrack is one of the most incredible recordings I have ever heard. The artificial castrato voice created for this film is sublime and definitely worth investing in."
2,Farinelli,"Two stars not because of the film itself (it is magnificent), but because of the very poor picture quality of the DVD. Scenes with slow movement (see, e.g., the last one, where he rides away into the landscape) are full with artifacts, probably due to poor coding. Btw, it is not the player, which might have problems with NTSC, other NTSC DVDs play perfectly."
5,"Its dark, its delicious, its a masterpiece!","An outstanding film with a outstanding cast performance, there are characters for whom you will really care for, when you are witnessing them on screen, you simply feel their grief, their joy. An outstanding chemistry between Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso who play the Broschi brothers brilliantly. The film doesn't only throw light on Baroque or simply the life of Carlo Maria Broschi, its much more than just a Biographical piece. The film is so engaging that you almost feel every single breath of the characters right from your couch. 'Farinelli' the film in simple words is a brilliant character study film and simply a delicious feast for the eyes."
2,Unimpressive,I love the Brandenburgs and thought this would be interesting. Unfortunately it is not. Jacques Loussier is a good place to start for interpretations of Bach from a jazz perspective.Jacques Loussier Plays Bach
1,Confusing connector spec,There was no spec that it has a Centronics connector and not a DB25 that my printer has. Called StarTech customer service They were not willing to help me with a proper adapter or point me in the right direction
1,Not pleased with product.,"The hardware package was fine, and the unit installed on an Epson Stylus Photo ink jet printer with no case modifications.The instructions, however, were confusing. I tried all optionsbut could not get the device to work on my LAN. Suspect that the router's IP address must be changed as well as the defaultaddress of the print server. Using fixed IP addresses on therouter for each PC, so that further complicates things."
5,Very good,"I had to contact customer service to get it installed. You will need to set a static IP address on this device, and depending on your printer you will likely need the Centronics Male/Female cable to get the Print Server away from the heat of the printer. This has solved print issues in the house with a Professor, Junior in College and two high schoolers."
3,Nice Print Server Except For Setup,"I've had this print server working with an old Canon Pixma inkjet printer for a couple months now, and it works great. The big issue is setup. It defaults to a static IP of 192.168.2.2, which is just silly. If your home network is configured to 192.168.1. xxx, like most are, you can't set it up. I ended up changing my entire home network 192.168.2.xxx, then setting the print server to DHCP, and life is good again. Otherwise, I'd have given it 5 stars."
5,Great adapter for those older printers out there !!,"I just purchased this item for my OLD IBM Proprinter that I still use. It's a real workhorse that I will never get rid off. I wanted to release it from my parallel to usb cable and make it wireless for my other 4 laptops to connect to it. This adapter worked great but I did need a little help with acquiring the right IP address....so I contacted their customer service dept. located in Canada and I have to say it was the best technical assistance I have ever had.They were without a doubt the most helpful people I have ever dealt with. They quickly helped me make the necessary adjustments and I was on my way in making my old printer wireless. So, if you're like me and have an old printer that still is worth keeping and you want to make it accessible for other computers on your network, well this is the baby to buy.Price is right and well backed with their customer service and its performance is simply great."
1,doesn't work with fountain pens,"These books are nicely bound, but the sealed paper doesn't play well with fountain pens. Beware!"
3,Just Okay,"I was able to watch the movie in one sitting, but it wasn't a good quality film, it was low budget and it looked more like someone filmed it with their home video instead of a motion picture camera.The story line was okay, I can't say I would recommend anyone to buy this movie. I would say rent it or bowrrow it from a friend who has it."
2,Too many issues-unresolved,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased a copy of this movie. It was drawn out- too many characters and not enough information regarding all the issues that surfaced. Acting was unrealistic at times and its ending was unexpected- actually not making too much sense.If you have nothing else to do and want to buy a very cheap copy of this movie, then it is probably worth it. However, if you want to watch a good movie- this is not the one to rent or buy."
4,From Trash to Cash,"Andy Warhol understood the conflict between the tastes of the masses and what's considered ""Good Art"" by the cognoscenti. His soup can and Marilyn Monroe took common icons and created pop icons instantly. This was one of the 20th Century's most brilliant comments on ""us"" and the world of art. The conflict between the rarified world of fine art and popular art is really fascinating, and this book hits the mark.King of Kitsch Hemmingway does a great job here of describing various popular artworks and why they've made the transition from ""bad"" to ""beloved."" A fun book, and a great concept, complete with peel-off art for your very own."
1,Crazy Price for 2 plastic shells,The concept is good but the price is crazy. There is nothing revolutionary about the concept and there is no patent on this item. One star for the crazy price.
1,Too expensive for its [low] quality,The shell does not hold the AA battery that well. I found it hard to keep the AA battery steady in the shell when plugging it into anything. Would be much cheaper to buy a piece of styrofoam and cut it to shape. It would work as good as this one.
2,battery adapter,Item fine but seller never responded to my emailed questions and gave me incorrect info over the phone.
5,great product,This is a terrific product - it's so nice to not have to go looking for a C battery - just pop in the AA (which I always have around) and go!
4,They work but you could definitely make your own,"If you had a bit of PVC and maybe some screws you could make your own but if you refuse, these are a solid 4/5 stars."
2,Too big,These are indeed too large for most applications. I've tried them in a few different items and for most of them they've been too big. I've found that taking the label off helps some but then you'll have to clean up the adhesive. All in all just buy the Sanyo ones and avoid the hassle.
1,Bigger than C-sized cells,The adapters are too big. I also have Sanyo eneloop C-sized adapters and they fit perfectly. These are TOO BIG for C sized cells. I was unable to fit them in any of my devices which use C-sized batteries.
4,"Great adapters, a bit pricey","The adapters I received look different than the picture on Amazon, but they work great. They fit well in the devices I used them in so far. I would have given them a 5 star rating, except they are a bit pricey for 4 plastic shells."
1,This batteries are good for Less then 10 months,"I bought 4 AA NIMH batteries and charger from LENMAR on 12/2004. I only use (charged) the batteries about 20 times , now the batteries are getting weak. I called LENMAR customer service, they are not replacing it. I would not recommend this battery. Be very careful about reading warrant (no warrant on AA batteries) Batteries: Lithium Ion Batteries - 2 Year Warranty NiMH, NiCd and SLA - 1 Year Warranty* Laptop Batteries - 1 Year Warranty Cordless Phone Batteries - 1 Year Warranty Cellular Phone Batteries - 1 Year Warranty (*Excludes AA & AAA round cells)"
5,Another Journey,"I have read all of Neil's books by now and I really enjoyed this one. To me, it would almost pick up where Ghost Rider left off. We find out a little bit more about Neil as he shares his memories and how certain songs remind him of those times. I realize that some people may find him as condescending but I think they are missing the point. At least he tries to explain things a little more, such as his apprehension about meeting fans and the like. After all, he is human. Overall I think this book, as well as the rest of them, are worth the read.."
4,Soundtrack to our lives,"This book is creatively laid out and is interwoven with past, present,and future experiences Neil Peart had, and might have...What Now??? As I read, laughter bursted out, as some of his childhood misfortunes played like a tape in my past...childhood can be so cruel!!! His explorations on four wheels were quite interesting and his attention to detail painted a clear picture in my head. (a quality I love in a book)This book will show the ""real man"" inside this very popular and private drummer from the Canadian band Rush. Quite an intimate view really, and my guess is hardcore Rush fans will be glued to every page.Traveling Music: The Soundtrack To My Life And Times can drag along at times, with more details or quotes than are needed to get a point across. But this is an enjoyable read and a book I couldn't put down..."
5,the highly interesting autobiography of Neil Peart,"this is travel writing woven with autobiographical elements, as Peart remembers his childhood and teenage years. From growing up in rural St. Catherines, Ontario, to moving to Britian for a year or two and playing with various bands, to finally joining Rush, this is the story of Neil Peart's personal and professional life. The most enjoyable aspect is that he goes over music that he was obsessed with as a teenager and an adult, and his drumming influences and teachers direct and indirect, like Keith Moon and Hal Blaine and Buddy Rich. It is mostly about his trip in his Porsche down to Big Bend state park in Texas, and the music he listens to along the way. It is a highly enjoyable, another terrific addition to Neil's several travel/ autobiography books. fans of nonfiction will certainly enjoy all of his books, especially this one. It has a lot of memorable pieces inside."
4,Traveling Music,"This man is not only a great musician, he's also a prettytalented writer. I enjoy his musings on music and life, not quite as powerfulas Ghost Rider, which will probably be his most powerful document/travelogue"
4,The Spirit of the Radio,"In Peart's third book he combines a bit of autobiography and travelog with musings on music, both current and early influences. He has a diverse group of musical interests, the majority of which have little to do with percussion. The praise of both Madonna and 98 degrees (not my taste) were unexpected and compelling. I found myself pulling some of the CDs in my collection out that I have not listened to in some time such as Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"" and a few old Rush tracks.My only criticism would be that the last section detailing part of his African bike trip felt tacked on. I enjoyed it on it's own merit, but in the context of the whole book it felt out of place. In the end he talks aboput the editing of the book and how he cut out the music that he rips apart. I have a feeling one might have been a trade for the other."
1,Poor Quality!,"These are the worst tubes I've ever purchased. I had purchased one before these and it lasted less than 100 miles before i had a flat. It was on the seam. Went home and replaced with another one and it went flat. Then did a 2nd one and it went flat. (had checked the tire first for a sharp object and it was ok) Luckily, i had another brand and it worked like a charm. Will never buy this brand again. Maybe it was just a bad batch from the factory. Hopefully the seller will take care of it for me....."
2,not worth the money,These robots are pretty lame. They make alot of noise but are very hard to maneuver and control
1,Huge Disappointment,"My mom had purchased this for my son and it was his big present this year. The demo mode ran fine, the training mode was pretty hit or miss and the battle mode was impossible. The robots rarely responded to the controller, honestly infrared is a poor choice for something like this, radio frequency would have been much better. I wish I would've read other reviews for this before my mother bought it. It broke my heart to see his excitement turn to disappointment. We're getting Rock'em Sock'em's instead."
3,Not as Accessible as I had Hoped,"I purchased this textbook because I am in the process of moving to the high arctic for work. I had hoped this book would provide a cultural encyclopedia of sorts that could help me adapt to the cultural setting I will be entering. Unfortunately, I think this text is geared more to the academic field of research and not so much to the layperson. I'm sure it's a central piece of research for the field in question, but for me I found large parts of it impenetrable - I guess I just didn't find what I was looking for."
3,"It's good, but not as good as it could be","I much prefer the RC 2 quick release plates, but I bought this one because of the 2 bubble levels. Those are the saving grace of this product. Otherwise, it's just an oversided, non-locking quick release plate."
2,I would not recocmmend this,"The service from the company was very good. The product itself was good. It didnt' smell like ""chicken"" base and didn't taste much like it either. Cant' say it was bad but it certainly didnt' tast good. As witht the beef version, the lower sodium version of Better Than Boullion, unfortunately, has more sodium than this one but it tastes SO much better. I'll have to go back to using that as this is not good."
5,"A Great, Quirky Vocal Jazz CD","Mose's music defies categorization. The old man's piano playing is aggressive, expressive jazz. But the structure and topics of his songs, and his manner of singing them come from the Blues. The songs are as funny as their titles suggest: Gettin' Paid Waltz; Certified Senior Citizen; etc. But serious messages are behind them: not PC and not written to sell records or win awards. The Blues Police break down his door in Ever Since I Stole the Blues. This cd has most of the songs that Mose performs on the road. If Mose's piano playing isn't as awe-inspiring as Marcus Roberts'Alone with Three Giantsor Jason Moran'sModernistic, and his singing doesn't take your breath away like Cassandra Wilson'sBlue Light 'Til Dawn, they will definitely entertain you and you will laugh! A similarly quirky fun cd is Joe Jackson'sJumpin' Jive. Approach Jazz Profile with an open mind and enjoy!"
5,"Talented voice, talented band","Your first listen will provoke the response ""what a beautiful voice!"" But Erin and her troupe weave such rhythmic maturity and sweetness that you can only conclude they are in love with music. To hear Erin in concert (a very recommended experience) is a treat through folk, jazz, blues as well as Paul Simon (one of her sources of inspiration). She so graces the presence of the St. Louis music scene that, were it up to us, we'd never let her venture beyond the three rivers. But it would be a crime to deprive everyone else of her talent."
5,Please Come Out on Video!!,"I have to agree that this is a great, great video for kids to help them learn about all the winter holidays. My kids have both been watching it since it first aired on the Disney Channel and I have to admit that it's now one of my favorite holiday videos, too. However, I have to agree that the VHS quality is very poor. We are now on our second tape, which I bought about a year ago, and the picture quality is noticably poorer than when we received it and we've only watched it 5 or 6 times. I would dearly love to see this come out on DVD so my kids don't lose an excellent (and informative!) video. So, 5 stars for Berry Bear Christmas, but 3 for video quality."
4,"Great Video, Terrible Quality...","We just purchased this one for our Bear-loving kids, and it's typical GREAT Bear quality in content. I'm sure we'll watch it again and again (and again). But I had to come online and check out the reviews here. Our VHS tape is extremely poor quality! My husband immediately asked if something was wrong with the TV--because the colors looked muted. But it's the tape. Grainy picture, washed-out colors. It looks like these were mass-produced the worst way--it reminds one of a bootleg tape, actually!Forgive me for reviewing the picture quality instead of the content, but I thought other buyers would like to know before they purchase. I doubt the kids will care, and now that I see that other buyers have had this problem, we won't be taking it back to the store. But honestly, I wish they had a DVD of this one! They may soon, and when they do, we'll be replacing this VHS pronto."
5,Very nice holiday video!,"This video covers bits of Christmas, Chaunacha (sp?) and Kwanza without offending anyone and has a good variety of songs (and funny varients of some well known songs) and an outstanding song (""Just Listen""). The two parts of the video segue into each other nicely. Very nice morale underpinnings to the plot. While the plot moves a bit slowly for some kids, patience is rewarded. Our kids at first were a little cool to this, but now it is the most requested ""Blue House"" video."
5,My daughter loves this tape!,"My little girl can't get enough of Bear. This special, in particular, has been a favorite of hers. The songs are fun - with a lot of Christmas spirit! There's always a touch of humor for adults with Bear and the Big Blue House, so it's a pleasure to watch this one again and again."
4,Pretty good,"Hosted by Beano Cook, this video series depicts fantastic plays of NCAA football.The short 30-minute video features great catches, runs, kickoff returns, and hits. It also attempts to list some of the great college football players in history.Pretty much all of the clips in this video are spectacular and worth watching. However, because the video wastes time trying to showcase some great players, we actually miss some of their highlight plays.We do get to see the Boston College ""Hail Mary"" play, as well as some other fantastic finishes, but I'm shocked that the Stanford/Cal ""Band on the Field"" play did not make it into the video. Oh well.This video is not perfect, but is good if you are looking for a bunch of exciting plays from the world of college football."
3,first sleeveless jersey purchase,"I am new to biking and decided I needed a sleeveless jersey for hot days. I picked this one mainly based on price and function (zipper pocket), but it also has somewhat of a stylish look. When it arrived, the fabric was much ""scratchier"" than I expected and there are only three pockets, not four as advertised, none of which have the advertised zipper. I think it is just ok, but I will be spending more money on a better brand for the feel and hopefully the advertised features. Also, fit is a bit snug. I got an XL and I wear an 8-10 women's size in regular clothes. I know biking gear is supposed to be sleek, but I like a bit more room and I am not worried about drag (I'm not going fast enough to worry about that...yet!) Just an ok jersey. I think I was also charged $17 in shipping and it was sent in one of those US mail one price envelopes - just a little sketchy. I don't mind paying such fees, but let's be reasonable..."
5,Use them all the time,"I have used these folders for years. They are put together stronger than any othertype of folder and are easy to put stuff in. Much, much nicer than the manila folders.Try it, you'll like it."
1,RipOff Pricing,"At $349 per copy, the authors of this software are very smart to not show their pricing on the product page.I have no idea if the product is any good at all as I refuse to pay an exhorbitant amount - See Cakewalk for a slightly less robust package at a more reasonable price.Shame on you for refusing to post your price - probably the only way you'd get anyone to spend that much!"
4,GOOD GAME!,ok this game rocks there are lot's of thing's to do in this game including home run derby and allstar and much more this game is worth every penny.
2,OK game,"This game can be entertaining, but only for a while. The graphics are fine for Gameboy, but everything else is not very realistic. It is way too easy to win- home runs can be hit 25% of the time while at bat. The codes for accessing saved games are too complicated with strange letters and numbers. It is way too monotonous of a game, and is not worth buying."
3,Confederate Admiral,"Craig Symond's ""Confederate Admiral"" is a brief biographical account of the life of Franklin Buchanan, the Confederacy's first admiral. Buchanan was prominent in the antebellum U.S. Navy serving as first superintendent of the U. S. Naval Academy, storming the Mexican fort at Tuxpan, and acting as flag captain during M. C. Perry's mission to open Japan in 1853. Buchanan went on to fight in the two greatest actions of the nascent Confederate Navy. He commanded CSS VIRGINIA during the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862 and led the ironclad CSS TENNESSEE against D. G. Farragut's fleet at the Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864. He was seriously wounded in both actions. Symond's biography is not a remarkable example of the biographer's art, but it is a serviceable book, perhaps mostly of interest to Civil War or naval history buffs. It is worth reading."
5,Timeless Worship,"This Cd is an excellent tool of ushering you into His presence! In 1995 THE SONG ""wHAT CAN I GIVE."" changed my whole ministry and saved my life. The song ""Take me back is timeless, it blessed in the 90's and will bless at all times for its message relates to people as they struggle everyday to abide in His presence. The Title is truly appropiate. This Cd is a must for those who LOVE to Enter and Remain in HIS Presence!!!"
5,"If you want your fiction to change lives, ask Ayn Rand","Half a century after the publication of her two seminal works of fiction, Ayn Rand is still selling 100,000's each and every year. And every year more and more editions and translations are issued. Atlas Shrugged was voted the second most influential book every written (behind its antipode - the Bible). Her books change lives. They take over.In this book, which discusses the 'how' of writing, Ayn Rand, states explicitly her methods for creating emotionally intense and lasting works. The information in this book is unique and is based on her understanding of how the mind works. This is a very practical guide for writers who are serious about writing. Clear, cogent and exciting."
4,Ayn Rand...,This woman's writings are almost cryptic to start with. The symbolism almost saturates her every thought and I dont believe I got all the lessons I should have from this book. I feel like I missed something after reading theis book. I found it a good but hard read.
2,Rand is the best novelist she knows..,"I like some things about this book, and in some ways it is very helpful.However, there is a pervasive arrogance that is not only distasteful but calls the integrity of the work into question. She tries to stuff everything into boxes.Ayn thinks she is the best novelist she knows. And it shows."
4,Concrete Writing,"The Art of Ficton explores the idea that fiction can be actively created and not passively channeled. While many authors look at writing as a mystical ex nihilo creation, Ayn Rand looks at the practical planning aspects of plot, theme, and other areas of novel organization. She encourages authors to say something when they write, to create with purpose. Those exploring the craft of writing will find this perspective a useful tool to give their writing more meaning."
5,What a Surprise!,"I've been a fan of Ayn Rand since 1966. What a delight and surprise to find this new book with so much clarified in the art of her own writing and thinking.This is a real how-to book for the aspiring writer. I recommend it highly. Even if you don't agree with Rand's philosphy, you will learn how to construct plot. And remember, plot sells!"
3,Useful for writers,"I'd rather give this book three and a half stars. I went with three instead of four to offset the blind blatherings of Randites who give everything Ayn touched five stars automatically.If you're interested in writing fiction, this book contains some very good lessons and advice. However, you have to filter our Ayn's enormous ego, including the howler of a line that she considers herself the best living writer of her time. When you get beyond that, her lessons on plot, theme, character, and concrete writing are valuable to anyone seeking to write quality fiction."
2,Read at your own risk,"There is, I admit, some very good avice here. But it's intertwined in a mine-field of bad advice. And the author's ego tends to drown out both. Read it, but don't take it to seriously."
1,Unimpressive,"If you're unsure about which view of the rapture is correct, look elsewhere. This book will definitely not solve your dilemma. Only one view is correct. The book was written in dialogue format. I know which view I believe but for those who are uncertain about what they believe, they will be more confused after reading this book. It's certainly not geared for the average reader."
4,A study and counterpoint of three rapture views.,"Three Views on the Rapture assumes a premillennial eschatology and contrasts the three primary rapture views. It is scholarly and probably not for the average reader. For the student of eschatology it is a very interesting work. The authors are quite respectful of one another, yet not fearful to mix it up. I recommend it only for those who already have some knowledge of issues concerning premillennial eschatology."
2,Poor Quality For Speakers with an Original Price Over 100,The speakers built into my monitor produce a clearer sound. These crackle and the quality is poor.
5,Positive advise on taking responsiblity for your life.,"I read this book 14 years ago while facing some real problems and challagening issues in my life. I still re-read ""The Optimist's Creed"" at least once a month! This unpretentious book provides clear, positive advise on how to stop being a victim and how to start taking resposibilty for your life. It offers timeless, common sense advise on how to set goals for yourself, how important delaying instant gratification is to achieving goals, and most importantly how to be responsibile for your own life(personal and business) and stop being a victim. A great self help book!"
5,Simply Outstanding...and Dark...,"Wow...one can only state this simple exclamation upon putting down this paperback edition of a modern American Classic. Bukowski writes with his usual fervor that the enthusiast has grown accustomed to. This is a collection of short, choppy stories, sometimes lacking much in the way of a coherent plot, but vivid and resounding nonetheless. These stories will leave an image in your head long after you've put this book down and will lead to compulsive reading of other Bukowksi classics such as ""Women"" and ""Post Office."" If you're a beginning Bukowski reader, I would suggest starting out with one of his novels before moving into his short stories to better get an understanding of his viewpoint and writing style. Still, this book should be in everyone's collection."
5,Terrific stuff. A must!,"This was my first experience with Bukowski, finished in a couple of days, and it was hard to put down. One story, two stories, and so on. You felt like going on forever, which is impossible if you don't have more books next to you. Buy two books at the same time, then you're better off. I couldn't help thinking that most of the stories have at least elements of thruth in them, and the way Bukowski describes drinking and the effects of that, combined with important issues that all of us should think about... Well, that is what makes this book great! Did you, for example, know that Burroughs sold his movie rights for Naked Lunch for 500 bucks? I can not guarantee for the thruth there, but still it can be. Buy it, and read it quickly. You will not be disappointed!!"
5,beautiful.,"very big fan of Charles Bukowski. already love it, (only four stories in) but it's so so great. In love!"
1,"Silly, Amaturish, ""Most Beautiful"" typifies poor writing","To suggest these works well or even moderately well written is to confuse the issues we have judged to be important in good writing. Burkowski has an obvious gift for crafting fine sentences, and to construct tales directly from life experience or perceived life experience is a beautiful thing, but not to spend even a moment making any sense of or trying to understand these experiences proves a true lack of insight. Semi-literate six year olds, lost in a chaotic twirl of inchoate thoughts and ramblings are capable of the same. All of this is not even to mention the trite, ridiculous heart that palps pitifully within each of these ill-considered works. Literature is more than this! For those who believe there is genuine meaning in organized human expression for the sake of communication, please do not be midlead by these silly stories."
4,Fine,"Seems like it will be good, it's tape and it sticks. Not much more to say about tape so that's about it."
3,BIG ROLL,its not the best but its good. its orange vinyl tape. similar to the one in home depot. slightly different.. maybe slightly worse =/
1,Not very sticky,This product is white tape as advertised. The stickyness factor combined with its narrowness makes it hard to use. would not recommend.
3,For Light Use Only,The steel bristles on this brush are too long and want to bend. Best for light use only.
5,Another magazine with my favorite star...then......BOMB....,"I just once bought it because Jessica Simpson was on the cover of the February 2004 issue. I collect all magazines with her on the cover, I thought this one would be the same TONS of advertisements and stupid fashion and make-up advice! But, No! I fell in love with the magazine it has boy advice, questions about your body you'd perfer not to ask your mother, and great quizzes. I recommend this magazine for girls 13-16! It is defenitely my fav magazine! If you haven't already looked at it go out and buy it now! You'll love it! Its not all about celebritys theres also a section where pros answer quesyions about your body and the general things you may need help with. It also comes with a large poster each month double-sided."
4,Twist Magazine,"I think that J-14 and Pop Star Magazines are better. But I say this is a 4-star rating to me. It gives you cool info on the latest celebrities. They have some celebrities tell you it's okay if you have like getting your period or growing breasts at a young age, and said that they had stuff like that too when they were like in Junior High. I didn't really expect that but that was nice of them to share that with the public. They also have the hot boys section, which is kinda ewwww for my age though. They have the fasion section, some teen's hilarious and embarrising stories section, quizes and sooo much more that I can't remember. If you're 13 or younger, you might want to show your this to parents so they can approve this magazine, if you don't then just skip the yucky, icky, and in-appropriate pages. Sorry if this review sounded boring to you, just a kid ya know."
3,"My kids love it...as a parent, I do NOT.","My 11 year old loves this magazine and all the gossip that goes with it. It's the typical teeny-bop stuff she and her friends enjoy reading. I allow them one of these magazine subscriptions, but praise her when she spends her time reading the National Geographic and other books that she actually learns something from. I think withholding this from her would just make her want it more and obsess about it, so I allow it. Thankfully she seems to leaf through it, make a few comments, and then could take it or leave it. We do, however, discuss that she cannot believe everything she reads in these magazines."
2,Twist=Disney Channel and a couple other stars,"In a nutshell--Twist magazine has the same stars/celebrities on its cover every month. Every issue will include at least 10-15 Disney Channel stars, a couple Nickelodeon stars as well and the popular bands/solo artist for young kids (One Direction, Justin Bieber). Sometimes even the covers will look the same."
1,still waiting,i ordered a subscription a month ago and it still isnt here. it would have been faster if i had walked to pick it up.
2,Still waiting,Long lead time for the orders. After few weeks time I am still waiting to get the first issue...
3,Twist,"Why do these magazines sell so well? They have dreamy pop stars on posters, and gossip, passing off as facts. This publication does just that.They may have one or two feature stories.Music artist are a huge draw, though few things are ever said about them. Instead comes a repeat of their favorites, and dislikes. I have a ton of these publication. Each has their own little quirks, making them more appealing to certain individuals.Things have changed since the earlier teen magazines which consisted of mainly pictures, and not all in color.However, these magazines need to further rethink. These magazines continue to push girls into something they may not want to be. There are females out there who could careless about the beauty, makeup, and fashion tips."
5,Twist magazine,My 10 year old daughter loves this magazine! There were no problems with the subscription. Perfect tween/teen magazine!
3,Spelling Error Mania!,"There are SO many spelling mistakes in this book, I can't even name them all. On the issue featuring Mischa Barton (Marissa from the O.C.) the spelt her name ""Misha"" and her onscreen name ""Marisa"", view the February issue for yourself. Also, they spelt Frankie Muniz (Malcolm from Malcolm in the Middle)'s name Frankie Munyze. Other than the immense amount of errors in spelling, I like this magazine. I bought it for the free nail art, but as I read inside the mag, I realized, ""Hmm .. this is good."" and I bought another issue."
2,Helped me decide to quit my job and stay home with my baby!,"This book is very amusing, at times, but it is primarily a rather ugly book. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I am still working full-time but felt embarassed to be reading this book on the train in the morning. I have been reading lots of ""mommy"" books, on both sides of the fence, trying to decide whether to stop working. This book did help me decide to do just that, though I know that was not its intent.UPDATE... I have stopped working and am now home with my toddler full-time. It is wonderful!"
4,Definition of bad parents,"Bad parents come in all shapes and sizes -- working mothers and stay-at-home moms alike. If you look at these authors objectively -- and don't stereotype them as working mothers or ""the enemy"" -- you will see this book is all too true and a good read."
2,"A bit interesting, but mostly bad.","I heard her on NPR a while back was really impressed with her interview and views on ""the mommy myth"", she touched on a lot issues that I have been feeling and I rushed out and bought this book. I kept picking it up and reading just bits of it a time, then putting it down for months at time, I just couldn't get in to it. It was angry and I felt alienated by it, I felt like the person I heard in the interview and person (or people) who wrote the book were from two different planets. I haven't picked it back up to finish it, in fact I just put it in my donate-to-charity box.There were some interesting points made, but it was very judgmental... a big turn off."
5,Excellent Analysis of New Mommism,"This is a much-needed and valuable book on the myth of the perfect, ever-so angelic mother that seems to permeate American society day-in, day-out. I am a child-free woman by choice and it astounds me that women still have babies in this country given the extremely hostile political, social and cultural atmosphere they must inhabit. This book has only confirmed my conviction that women in general and mothers specifically are a truly disadvantaged, oppressed, subordinated group of people. I will go so far as to say women are a colonized bunch, both mentally and physically.Mothers and mothers-to-be in the United States: pick up the book and smell the exploitation/oppression that you are swimming in."
2,Tedious and shrill,"This could've been an interesting read, but the 'let's invent a word and pretend it's a real concept for page after page' bit made it very tedious. The 'Sometimes I hate my children, thus so do all mothers' conclusion was not useful and the authors' contempt for women who enjoy motherhood was strange, to say the least. I could not get the word ""harpy"" out of my head while reading. Fans of Susan Maushart's brand of unempowering axe-grinding will enjoy this, though...The section on pop culture was entertaining and the book would have been entertaining as simply a fluffy look at that genre of fluff. Attempts at serious ventures into social policy issues were not successful here; any researcher whose conclusions differed from the authors' was subject to shrill attack.Parents interested in scholarly works on motherhood should check out Rima Apple instead, particularly ""Mothers and Medicine."""
5,"Waving my white flag in the so-called ""Mommy war""","This is a terrific book, both droll and pithy. You don't have to agree with every point the authors make, but they do make a convincing argument that the unrealistic standards set by the ""Mommy wars"" pit mother against mother, instead of allowing us to unite and find common ground."
3,"Excellent Subject Matter, Strident Tone","This book makes a lot of excellent points about the misinformation women are fed about motherhood, about other possibilities (and yes, these possibilites tend towards government help for mothers which may offend the truly insane), and about the ways that this misinformation hurts women. The book has an excellent point to make and a fair bit of good information to back it up, but it becomes difficult to read due to the shrill and irritating political asides that are constantly distracting from the point. If you can get past the writing to the ideas, it is a book well worth reading, but that's easier said than done."
1,Why have children if others take care of them?,"Anyone who concludes that to be a good mother one must get a ""real"" job and dump their children in the hands of strangers is, in my opinion, immoral. If your children are in school/daycare all day, you are at work, and then when they come home you don't have much time for them (just ""quality time,"" making children fit into YOUR schedule when kids don't understand such things and NEED a mommy)....*WHY oh why did you even HAVE children?!*"
5,Awesome bone!,"Got this for our retriever / doberman mix...she loved it! At first it was so large that I think she was a bit intimidated by it, but after a few days of coming up with an attack strategy she went right to town....and finished it in 3 days.Typically a large rawhide lasts about 4-5 hours for her, so it was definitely a value. Also, it was hilarious to watch her run around the house holding onto it.Bought it for one of our friends pitbulls too, it's a great dog gift!"
3,Puppy Loves It But Eats It Too Fast,"My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24"" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going. So according to her it is a 5 star product based on how much she loves it. But in my judgement it is sort of expensive for 2 days of chewing. I will buy this product occasionally but will seek a more economical alternative. My guess is that most dogs will not chew it up as quickly."
5,GREAT,My dog (medium sized husky) loves rawhide as her favorite treat. This was so fun to give for Christmas. Her eyes lit up!
1,Not a good bone.,I bought this bone because its length is good for my large dog. The structure of the bone's material is very weak and prone to premature breaking and tearing. I would recommend looking elsewhere if your dog has any teeth.
1,not because it's not good,"My dog used to love these until I found out they were not good for his digestive track. These bones truly were like dog crack. He would act crazy when he got one! Now I have him on natural bones and his behavior has changed completely. Now he's easier to live with. I would not recommend giving these to your dog, they are not healthy at all for them."
4,happy about price more than anything,"Shipping was fast! The bones are good quality. Some are smaller than others but, they are thick inside. My pitbull loves them! Saved 2/3's by not paying $16-$20 each at pets stores. Will be buying them here from now on."
5,The standard text,"How can one argue with the original standard text? It was obviously written by an academic for academics, but it a great book nonetheless.If you are looking for a more gentle introduction, try John Rahn's Structures of Atonal Harmony."
1,pass,"The author's method of ""revealing...deeper organizational characteristics"" is to arbitrarily circle arbitrary sets of notes, assign them meaningless names like ""4-17"", and make trivial assertions about the integers from zero to eleven."
1,Money for nothing,"I have ordered a seal and a clutch set from Parts Authority a month ago. I have been waiting for more than a month but I still have not received the products yet however I was promised to get it within 5 days. I can't use my car without it, the seller have not responded my e-mail.I would give a negative rating but there is no such option."
4,"Enlightening, tragic and inspiring.","The book provides an excellent cross-section of letters painting a vivid picture of Van Gogh's life. It is not an all-in-one biography, though, in that Van Gogh makes references to work that only curators and art historians can picture. It would have been nice to have a black and white thumbnail of the finished paintings as Van Gogh wrote of them."
1,Sassy Show-off,Excellent backing band spoilt by a self-indulgent singer who preferred to show off her vocal techniques rather than strive to be musically tasteful. In a word: repulsive.
2,Be sure to buy the CD you think you're buying!,"This CD is NOT the album to which most of these reviewers refer. Amazon has two VERY different CDs marketed under the name ""After Hours"". The one sounding like it was recorded after hours in a bluesy, smoke-filled bar was released in 1997 and the cover has Sarah standing in front of a mike. Here are a couple of links:After HoursorAfter Hours [Jazz Heritage Edition]."
4,Bad Dates,"Note that the ""original release date"" is given as 1955, but this recording dates from 1961, as is pointed out in other reviews and even in the official remarks."
3,Another Victim of Excessive Noise Reduction,"Michael Cuscuna has been credited as the reissue producer on Blue Note's remastered offerings since at least the mid 90s. Problem is, the reissues in every case, except Blue Note's two Monk titles, are worse than what preceded them. Extremely poor mastering and excessive noise reduction have been the primary problems with his projects, leading myself and others to seek out the original CD's from the 80's or pay the stiff premium for Japanese versions.Unfortunately, this great Sarah Vaughan collection of songs was remastered in 1997 under Cuscuna's direction, and as you've probably already guessed - it's had the ambiance and life sucked out of it by the use (misuse) of excessive noise reduction.When is someone at Blue Note going to correct this on-going problem? Seventeen years of unacceptable product is enough. They are stewards of some of the most important recordings ever made, and such historic material surely deserves better treatment than this."
2,i have yet to recieve my book ... its aug 12th now and no book...,i have yet to recieve my book ... its aug 12th now and no book... it has been well over 6 to 10 business days
1,story time,this is a fiction story advertised and sold as a non-fiction fact.... the narrator makes only subtle hits to this fact. when paying as much as this film was and expecting a non-fiction story i got robbed. this item should be categorized with movie as fiction. i was offended as to the way the narrator made constant remarks throwout the story that this is a factual story that it had to be this way or that because of this and that when we all know no one has any true knowledge or facts of this time era. the only thing i found nice in this story was the filmography had some very nice nature scenes. i would not rec amend this story to anyone i would rec amend to watch a story like Jurassic park first.
2,ONLY ONE GOOD AND PROPER FIGHT SCENE,This film Kung Fu the movie woulld appeal to most people but I do not like it. It is a bore. The end fight with Cardine and Brandon is good but even that is slow. It is not a great film but if you like a film with one good fight in it feel free to get this. DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $5 FOR IT
1,this was a movie that was bruce lee's Idea,this movie sucked they stole it from bruce lee put david caradine in it who doesn't know anything except a little Tai Chi. Personaly I don't think it desrvs one star
4,Is there EVER going to be a DVD Release?,"As has been pointed out, whatever it's flaws, this movie DOES nicely ""wrap up"" several plot threads from the original Kung Fu Series. That being the case, and with the whole Series now out on DVD, why no release of this one except on VHS Tape?I'm not aware who owns the rights to this film, but someone needs to make a suggestion to them, please?"
4,Very Good,"Brandon Lee is a very great martial artist, and as much as a role he had in this film it was enough to light up the screen and create a wonderful movie, I am a martial artist and have studied the martial arts my whole life just to be like my idol...Brandon Lee."
3,"Above Average followup, ten years later to original series. Not as good","Caine is still wanted and kindly widowalso wants info on slain husband whoonce befriended him. Followed by Carradineas Caine again in Fourth Kenny RogersGambler movie with Reba McEntire (1991),then in Kung Fu: The next generation, film-ed in Toronto for three years, 1993-96."
4,kids have fun with it,"My kids love this game, they love Max and Ruby. The only thing I don't like is the box it comes in is not a solid box so once you take the game pieces out of the package you can not use it to store the game in. There are 16 small game pieces to keep track of. We put them in a sandwich baggie and try to keep it all together."
1,Disappointed,"I am VERY disappointed in this game.First of all, there was a character missing in one of the colors.Next, the game is very confusing because several of the colors do NOT match. There is red on the pop up block, but not on the board; pink on the board, but not on the block; yellow on the board but not on the block...This game is not worth the price that I paid for it and is rarely played because of the confusion.It's a shame, because my daughter really loves Max & Ruby."
2,Buyer Be Aware!,"Buyer be aware this is the UK version with US info. Spelling and terminology is UK English and can be different than US terminology. Not saying this is a bad book, but I could not find anywhere on the listing BEFORE I purchased it that this was the UK version. VERY DECEPTIVE. I will keep the book, but not happy with it."

4,Magnificent Value,"Hard to find any fault with this watch or any contemporary Zodiac product. These are Swiss made watches, not Asian or who knows where and they have excellent durability and function. Sounds like a sales job but I am not affiliated with Zodiac or any watch manufacturer. I am however, a used and vintage watch dealer and was just thinking today that these are one of the best values in the Swiss watch industry today. [...]"
4,Latest by Jerry Uelsmann,"Somewhat a photographic collection of the ""best of Jerry Uelsmann"" -the intricate, fantasy-like surrealist photographer. Works almost solely in the darkroom - not digitally. The book does not really mention Uelsmann's pristine practice in the darkroom, however provides quotations from the artist.Had this book delivered just in time before the artist came recently to Pittsburgh. The 70 year old charismatic artist was kind enough to sign my book. Very entertaining, down to earth modern artist."
2,Confirm Your iAudio is Compatible!,"I purchased the cradle for an X5L 30 GB iAudio by Cowan. Although I had checked the Cowan site for the cradle, nothing implied that the X5L would NOT fit in the X5 cradle. When the cradle arrived from Amazon, the iAudio would not fit. I wish I had known there was a different cradle. Unfortunately, no one seems to carry a cradle for X5L so if you want one, I guess you are out of luck.Amazon was great in taking the item back, paying the shipping cost. Amazon gets 5 stars."
2,Oh man...,"Ok, I picked this up on the cheap, so with that in mind; bleh. Tribute albums are almost always bunk, and this one is no different. A few of the tracks are ""ok"", but the vast majority make me reach for the ""skip"" button.The (few) standouts:""Pleasure Heads"" is ok. Not stellar by any means.""Sonny's Burning"" has comedic value. Phlegmy black metal vocals are fun.""Nick the Stripper"" is set to goofy electro with ""Seinfeld"" bass. Actually pretty good.""Mr. Clarinet"" is even more foppish than the original. Good stuff.""Faint Heart"" by Melt Banana is the most faithful, and probably the best.The rest of them are either generic or just plain bad. ONLY recommended for folks who ""just can't get enough Birthday Party"" (in schlockey radio-guy voice.)Overall, this record does not bode well for San Diego, or 3-1-G records."
1,Worst O. Chem. Text,"There are many mistakes in this book in many of the mechanisms. Many of the mechanisms are not completely drawn out and are missing many arrows and non-bonded/lone pair electrons. Compared to other O.Chem. textbooks that I have read, this one does not flow in a manner that is very easy to follow and the frequent mistakes make it even more difficult. I would not recommend this book to any professor or student taking O.Chem."
4,Great texbook,"I purchased this for my Organic Chemistry I class, but it was used in both semesters of organic chemistry. It was very easy to follow with lots of figures, charts, and pictures. It was very easy to follow, especially since I had purchased the solutions manual and model kit along with it. Highly recommended textbook with very clear descriptions!"
3,Ok,"For me, Organic Chemistry is a dense subject. The book does an average job at explaining reactions. It doesn't help with putting the information all together like some of my other technical books do. Also, there are no answers to at least the odd problems in the back of the book. Instead, a student would have to buy a separate solutions manual. I recommend Organic Chemistry I Workbook for Dummies -- cheaper and better."
3,Not quite what title stated,Ad said book was hardcover. When I opened it I found that it was paperback. Same author and edition but not what it was advertised to be...
1,Never received book,I ordered this book on August 25th and never received it so I can't really review a product that I never got.
5,Head gear for a true Patriot,"My wife is a New England Patriots fan, and I thought this would make a great Christmas present for her. So I ordered it. The quality is great - not some cheap kind of hat you find in a discount store. It fits her perfectly, and has a sturdy bill on it. When she rips it off and hoops and hollers over a really good play or even a touchdown, the hat doesn't collapse.Would definitely buy something similar for her again."
1,Poor Service,"I ordered my flowers on Feb. 6th and just now received an email that a refund was just sent.... WITHOUT prior communication! Now I have no flowers less than a week from Valentine's Day. Yet they are still selling there flowers!!In fact, they charged me $10.70 and refunded me $10.69... so I pay for doing business??!!!"
1,Washing ton DC from the Air,"Faint and not sharp photography. Far worse than ""Above Washington"". If you'd like to buy this book, you will waste your money. Don't buy this book."
5,The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul is Back,"Definitely her BEST CD in several years!My favorite is ""Enough Crying""Go out and cop this joint."
5,Nice album,"MJB's latest album The Breakthrough takes us back to What's the 411?, My Life, and Mary. She stepped it up from the so-so works Love & Life and No More Drama. One of the best albums of 2005. Good job Mary."
2,Disappointed!,"I'm a Mary J fan and I have almost all of her CD's. I applaud her for getting through some bad times and sharing them with the public. But life story and music are 2 different things. This is my least liked CD of hers. Mary tends to scream through songs when she is trying to get a point across and it takes away from her vocal ability. Also I am ready for her to make some ""happy"" songs. I also have a problem with the message young teenage girls will get from her song ""Father in you"". Daddy is acceptable to me as a term of endearment but we already have too many girls trying to replace ""daddy's"" with boyfriends and husbands.My friends ""raved"" about the CD. Mary was all over Tv. So I went out and brought it. There are only 2 songs that I like. Disappointed !!!!"
2,Globalaza,"Beautiful cd cover that promises sophistication, quality and a certain regality. Some of the tracks deliver, most don't. Now, I am a big MJB fan. In fact, I have just about every cd she has done since ""What's the 411?"" days. But, this cd, like so many others fools me with one or two songs I just can't get enough of put on a cd that I consider largely forgettable.The track ""I Found My Everything"" is a haunting, soulful, masterpiece of a song that is reminscent of the days of Aretha Franklin in the late 60s and 70s. NO one will be unmoved listening to this song. It is a superb in its souring vocals, short and focused background singing, and amazingly expansive instrumentation. If only it were one of many.Unfortunately, none of the other songs appeal as much. It is not a disappointment to die hard MJB fans, but it is doubtful this cd will bring new fans. It is not truly a Breakthrough."
2,Just Average,"I am not a die hard MJB fan as I see most of you are that wrote reviews. I flip flop with her, sometimes she can sing to me, and sometimes she sounds awful. This cd was pretty average to me, (but SO much better than that last garbage that she put out). ""No One"", ""Alone"" and the Will.I.Am song were about the only ones that I would listen to. On ""Ain't Really Love"" she screeches through the chorus and sounds awful! I heard she took voice lessons but I can't tell!"
5,A MASTERPIECE!! MJB truly is da MVP!!,"From someone who has followed MJB's career from the very beginning, just look how far she has come! This is clearly the Breakthrough -- so aptly titled this album is.This is one of those 5 albums you take to that desert island. I can listen to it over and over again.Of course, you could hear her tremendous talent in even ""What's the 411,"" but now her voice is so incredibly silky smooth. She is clearly one of the very best singers alive today. And having seen her perform live, I can tell you that it is 100% real, and not the result of a mixing board.But most of all, I love how her lyrics speak to me, especially as a woman who has been through a lot and is around the same age. She is so hearbreakingly honest about going through lots of pain, abusive relationships -- all the curves in the road of life -- but how you can learn from your mistakes and still hold your head high as a queen.How do you even top this one? MJB is only gonna rise higher and higher!"
4,The queen is back,"I've been a Mary J Blige fan for years now, and I haven't been moved by one of her albums like this since 1999's MARY. This is her best album since then. Mary brings the heat on THE BREAKTHROUGH! On this CD she really sings, instead of the histronics we are used to hearing from her. There's a nice mix of uptempos, and downtempo ballads. Some of my favorites include ""Be Without You"", ""No One Will Do"", ""Father In You"", ""Alone"", ""Ain't Really Love"", and more. Overall I'm happy to say Mary is back!"
5,OMG....Totally Unexpected,"ummmm....o.k. I'm not really one to get caught up in the hype of the ""latest record"" and with an artist as big as Mary dropping a new release, that is exactly what i was expecting...a couple of decent songs but mostly hype. Plus I've been burned so much recently...But this c.d. really is CRAZY. The production is simply SICK....amazing job from the producers. Can't even pick favorites yet b/c I just started listening...but for real, cop this one"
4,OK,"There is only 1 song on the entire CD that I like. The CD was ok but for the price, I couldn't beat it."
5,SUPERB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I been a Mary fan from the beginnin' and this is one of her best cd's it will rank up there with ""My Life"" and ""What's the 411"" and ""Mary"" a true classic. Mary should be winning a lot of awards in ""06"" with ""The Breakthrough"" all tracks are done in Mary's style and sass. What's left to say, but Mary J. Blige you did a superb job with ""The Breakthrough"". No one can touch the Queen of Hip Hop Soul UR Supreme!"
3,MJB:doing Her Best Mariah,"what happens if Mary J.Bliege entered Mariah Carey's world? well the lead off single&the overall vibe leads you to that mindset.I dig Old Mary's stuff,but Vocally I can't tolerate Her singing anymore.vocally She gets on my nerves. this Album is better produced than her Previous last 2-3.song Selection has 2-3 real winners here.at this stage of Her career the overall presentation means more.this Album ain't touching Her first two albums no even close,but this is better than that Live Album&the last 2 albums easily.Mary J.Bliege trying to make that Mariah Carey style comeback complete with the Beyonce Album cover look.Mary did the right thing by releasing a New studio Album now&then hopefully next she will drop that Greatest Hits package which to me will cover Her Career up the best.Album Wise at this stage aside from a few songs I can take or leave Her Album stuff.this is a Pretty good set."
3,It's Cute,"""My Life"" is definitely one of her best albums. ""What's The 411"" is her second best. ""Share My World"" is 3rd. Any TRUE Mary fan would know this. ""The Breakthrough"" doesn't even make the top 4! I'd put it at number 5."
5,MARY IS HAPPY!!,"This CD is Mary's BEST, you can tell she is soooooooooooooo HAPPY!! inside and out!! Her music shows it, a MUST BUY!!! COP-IT!"
3,colossal BREAKDOWN!!!!!,"3 1/2 star effortMary, Mary, Mary...perhaps should have been focused less on a Vibe cover spread that did not make her look like someone other than who she truly because this latest effort does not reflect growth and maturity.Let downs: No One Else Will Do, Gonna Breakthrough [duhn duhn dunna, duhn duhn, dunna - Mary are you kidding!!! me?!] , Baggage, MVP (classless mixed tap calibre track) Can't Hide from Love, and Take Me As I Am.Unfortunately, Mary is still trying to cater to the brokenhearted, hurt, used and abused audience and that is what makes this album mediocre and less credible because as a ""happily married woman"" she can no longer genuinely sing about heart ache if she's pleading for the world to take her as she is: in love and beyond drama!!! :::scratching my chin:::Alone track ""help me out I'm so confused"" my sentiments exactly.However, Be Without You, Father in You, and I Found My Everything are standout tracks on constant repeat. :::wink:::"
5,Excellent Excellent Excellent,Every single track on this amazing C.D. is incredible. Worth its weight in gold.
4,Her BEST ALBUM in years,"Well well after Love And Life found Mary being happy and in love and boring, she gets all fired up and pissed off to this listener's pleasure. Mary is at her best when she has soem thing to rant and rave about, This time it is about how hard you have to work to be what you wan to be to stay wher eyou are and then work to love and be loved. Obviously Mary loves her husband slash. partner, but she says thnak god i won ttake nay crap. Of all the tracks on this cd that stand out for me, her version of U2;s One is a definging moment fo r me. She turns thi sismple song into a plea for treting each other with respect and love wailing we hurt each other but well do it gain . Thats' the lesson that Mary J Blige shares."
5,God Blessed the World by giving us Mary J Blige,"The Breakthrough is absolutely outstanding.. Every single song on this cd is a masterpiece. Mary voice is authentic, raw , emotional , gritty , and beautifully matured. She never sounded better in her life. I am amazed on how she effortlessly stay so soulful and hip hop at the same time .. Great female singers in the past never accomplished that.. And these new (xerox .. copy Mary style )girls can't even compare to Mary J Blige brilliance.I fell in love with Mary J ever since the first time I saw the "" Real Love"" video , when Mary and all these female dancers was running down an alley way with hoodies , baseball caps and combat boots. That blew me away !!And I still love her til her latest video "" Be Without You "" in which she's chillin' wearing a wifebeater and sweats.. Keepin it EXTREMELY Real..I relate to her then and I relate to her now !!Keep doing ya thing Mary !! Keep yourself happy .. God Bless"
4,Can't keep a good woman down!,"I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is Mary J. Blige's best work, but it is still a pretty decent album. Her vocals are some of the best she has laid down in awhile, and the production, on most tracks, is excellent. There are one or two filler songs, but for the most part, each song is at least enjoyable enough to not skip the tracks.The true gems here, in my opinion, are ""I Found My Everything"", which showcases Raphael Saadiq's best production is his career, ""No One Will Do"", which is an excellent opening track, and of course, the lead single that convinced us all to buy this album, ""Be Without You."" And I must admit that that her take on ""Hate It or Love It"", ""MJB Da MVP"" is a guilty pleasure of mine.Although this is not Mary's absolute best work, it is still proof that she is the soul hip hop queen, and she ain't going nowhere, but you already know her.-Nathaniel"
5,Mary J's best record ever!!!!,"This by far, is Mary J. Blidge's best album ever! I enjoyed almost every song on this cd. It is an inspiring piece of work that R&B fans will enjoy!"
5,"The only ""Breakthrough"" You'll ever need","After this CD, what more do you need. I was impressed and I can honestly call her the reigning ""Queen"" of hip-hop soul. Mary showed her maturity, progression, hurt, love and pain. After you show all of yourself the way Mary did there is nothing left to do but receive your breakthrough and move forward. This CD is a classic and I wish that I would have bought it a lot sonner than I did!"
5,Only my 2nd MJB CD...have I been missing out!,"I haven't bought an MJB album since her first (I actually have a cassette tape of her first album...how old does THAT make me?). Not because I wasn't a fan, just because she gets enough airplay, I'd get plenty of her by just listening to the radio. But, I LOVE this album. This is truly our next...dare I say...Aretha Franklin!"
5,Therapeutic!,"This CD has been so therapeutic for me, personally! Nice mix of upbeat tempos and slow grooves. My favs are ""Take me as I am"", ""Baggage"", ""Can't get enough"" and ""Alone"". The entire album takes you through the entire emotional process of a relationship, the great times of being so enthralled with the other person, to maybe having to leave to protect your heart.I mean she is the most honest artist out there I know. She was so transparent in her song 'Father in you', that a strong woman such as her, can go from being practically 'male-hating' to the point where she can be vulnerable and say 'Hey, I need you'! Also, she understood that even though she didn't have that typical ""Father"" role model, she could get all of those things from her husband. Mary, in case you ever read this, I would like to thank you for sharing with us those moments when you were down but more importantly, I thank you for showing us that you will eventually get up and when you do, you will be a better person!"
4,The best MJB yet,"These are 16 terrifically sung tunes, mostly on the theme of, you guessed it, love...The team-up with U2 is particularly outstanding (they brought the house down together at the Grammys, in case you missed it). An exemplary R&B vocalist and pretty much the closest thing to Aretha going today, apart from the real Aretha her own self..."
3,Just o.k.,"As usual Mary J. has good music to her so-so voice. I really only like two songs on this, ""Can't be without you"" and "" I don't want no one but you""."
4,Oh Mary!,"Mary has been my love for so long; she is such a songstress. She is so real. You can relate to her cd's and this one is just as good if not better than the last. My favorite's are ""SO LADY"" and ""MJB the MVP"""
3,Um... Am I missing something?,"I just need to understand... Am I missing something here?! I too am very much excited that MJB is no longer on drugs, dating KCi and has found Jesus. But, honestly... she just has not been the same since. The first single accompanied by the raves of everyone made me go get that album. And unlike 411, My Life, Mary etc.. I think it has made it to the CD player twice. My suggestion: burn or wait... Not a must have."
5,Ms. Mary Mack,This is one the best albums Mary has done I love all of her stuff but her growth is evident on this album proving she ain't going no where soon and she only gets better with time.
2,oh no just shut up,this cd was so boring i listend to the whole thing and fell asleep while listening to it um now it was boaring but some songs are good so my advice is buy it but wait till the price go down cuase like i alwys say you will be wastin you money
2,"Well, at least it was better than ""Love & Life""....","Yeah, go on. Give me an unhelpful vote.But this album as a whole is very average. While it's certainly well-produced; most of the songs DO, as another reviewer pointed out, sound the same; the lyrics are mostly weak, and the melodies are virtually non-existant. The only songs I really like on here are ""I Found My Everything"" and ""One"" (a great song, even though I don't really like U2); while ""Good Woman Down"", ""Baggage"", ""Be Without You"" and ""About You"" are OK.(which seems like a lot when you write it all down, but think about it; 6 good/ok songs on an album with 16 tracks?)But the rest of the songs on here either send me to sleep; or are really unlistenable (""Enough Cryin"" and ""MJB Da MVP"" are awful).Maybe if Mary had just released the 10 best songs here as ""The Breakthrough"" I'd have given it 3 stars; but the fact is, with all the filler here; unless you're a HUGE MJB fan, you probably don't want this."
1,I guess I was wrong about only looks matter,"And Mary J. Blige said, ""Hey I can be as generic as any other female r&b singer on the radio!"" On a side note, what jacka** told her she was fine? Don't you long for the good old days when she always wore shades & kept her body covered?"
1,No More Drama?,This CD sux just like Mary's live performances & attitude!!!Aren't we all just about getting a little tired of Mary talking and singing about her troubles? Time to move the hell on...geez.So annoying.
1,mary's gettingf better but I still can't stansd her,good musuic if you like mary j blige I advise all her fans to get thiscd but since I'm sick of mary I'll blast it I can't stand none of the songs on here.
5,Amazing can't even describe this....,"This album is nothing less than amazing. It is quite possible that this is MJB's best album of her career! I usually go through each song when I pop in a new cd....listen to a minute or so of each one and then skip to the next. I didn't do that with this album - I couldn't - I couldn't touch anything. Every single song, all the way to number 16, is incredible! If you're a fan of Mary, this is a must-have. If you're not a fan of Mary, I would highly recommend this album. I guarantee if you aren't a fan and pick this up, you'll go back and purchase her prior 6. Again, amazing!"
3,The Breakthrough,"If I had one word to describe the majority of this album it'll be ""Tha Knock"". On a serious tip, Mary's background music makes you scream, ""That's that Knock."" For the most part this album is ok. It's certainly not terrible but does not stand out as a legendary piece. What I love most about this album is the purity, honesty and sincerity it contains. Mary's lyrics are filled with reality. I'm not a die hard MJB fan but I do have this album. The vocals are barely there. But what takes this album over the edge is the sincerity in her voice. Simply stated you feel Mary through her music and although her vocals are not the greatest you listen and will continue to listen because Mary is real. Mary is the reigning queen of R&B; for that simpe fact.Stand Out Tracks (yes, in that order)OneCan't Get enoughBe Without YouCan't Hide From LuvI found My EverythingTake Me As I Am"
5,a practical guide through grief,"This book contains concise, readable information, including helpful quotes and graphics. It will help you learn to identify your loss experiences, to learn that everyone's grief is unique and that the grieving experience is a natural healing process. You will learn how to help yourself heal and how, when and where to find help and support."
4,captivating,"Loved it! I thought that this was an excellent source in understanding Buddhism with a little more depth. This book kept an intense interest, as I never wanted to put it down!"
4,Introduce McManus to Younger Readers,"This is a collection of selected Patrick McManus short stories edited for younger readers. They are just as funny as the originals and will be a good way for me to introduce my kids to McManus when they get a little older.I knocked it down a star because it wasn't made clear that these were stories from his other books edited for kids. I thought it was all new material!McManus is THE classic outdoor humorist. His earlier work had me falling off the couch laughing it was so hysterical. His later work is more thoughtful, but it's all funny. Everyone should read McManus!"
3,A little disapointed,I have read Pat McManus books for many years and really enjoy them. I was disappointed in this book. I was expecting new stories and this is only copies of what appears in earlier books.
4,Never Cry Arp!!,This is a collection of McManus stories for younger readers. The stories are written in typical McManus style with the key characters finding themselves in situations where something funny or unusual happens. It is a great introduction for younger readers into the zany world of Pat McManus and his outdoor experiences.
4,Fun DVD for Vegan Cooking,"Kerry shows how to cook vegan food with a can-do punk rock DIY attitude. He makes it look easy, in that things don't have to be perfect, if you have tasty ingredients. I would say that he should cook the onions a little longer so they have that caramelized sweetness that makes it better, and not crunchy. His sloppy joe recipe looked good, but he put too much pepper(and he admitted it)in it. I am eager to try the recipes, and I love the titles of the recipes. Perfect DVD for veg-curious punk rockers and their compatriots. In the end he visits Food Fight Grocery in Portland, Oregon and he recommends various vegan resources."
4,Spirited,"My true rating is more like a three and a half stars. I agree that he can be a bit vulgar, but I like his spirit. Also, it's fun to see a young guy cook and not make apologies for it! It's worth a watch. It educated me on seitan, since I'm new to the vegan scene."
4,Vegans *CAN* be funny!,"Not only does the chef's personable attitude and the colorful background make it fun to watch but the recipes have punchy names and are both hearty and relatively inexpensive to make. This cooking DVD defies the ""rabbit food"" stereotypes usually geared towards vegan/vegetarian diets and is accompanied by a hardcore soundtrack! I found myself giggling at some of the ingredients lists and the recipe names. My favorite being ""Eviction Notice Sloppy Joes"" (for when your roommate is stealing your rent money).The only thing I would suggest is more desserts!"
4,Food for the Next (Wise) Generation,"I finally got this for Christmas, and it is one of my favorite gifts.The chef does a great job describing the recipes, while making you laugh, as well as cussing a few times. The recipes are amazingly delicious, not to mention good for you, and unnecessarily cruel to animals.Forget the meat industry."
1,FAIL,If your idea of a cooking program includes listening to an arrogant d-bag drop the f-bomb every other word then this video is for you! This poor suburban brat couldn't think of anything worse than a steak dinner to rebel against. This is the kind of kid you'll see walking in the mall after school with a red swollen lip piercing and dark eye shadow trying to look edgy. Unfortunately the only thing hard core about this video is that he actually eats those same dishes that he can't seem to make correctly in the video.
5,She took my political virginity,"Until this album, I was blissfully unaware of the world outside my teenage bubblegum. I credit the consiousness of her voice (both literally and figuratively ) with determining my world view up until this day. Thank you Joan"
1,Not a romance,"I cannot understand why the author thinks readers would want to see an abused woman like Jenna in a relationship so completely submissive. We don't see her become her own woman. Some of the things Clint made her do seemed like torture for her after her abusive husband. Also, I didn't do a word count, but if you don't like p***y used by everyone for female anatomy, don't bother with this book. I finished it, but I'm deleting this book from my Kindle."
3,Wished I liked it better,"I wanted to like Promises Prevail, but I just couldn't connect with the characters. I thought Clint was a jerk (at first anyway) and even though there was a very valid reason why Jenna was submissive, I wasn't able to empathize with her. I skimmed all of the sex scenes and just wanted to know how the resolution of her past was going to be played out. The abuse was hard to read, but the story had a nice ending. However, I don't plan on reading anymore books in the Promises series."
2,Disappointed,I was looking forward to reading this book after reading Asa and Elizabeth's story. I just didn't like this book; no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't care about Jenna and what happened to her she was way too whiny and pathetic. I found this book boring and I started to browse through it just be to done with it.
2,Did not live up to the Promise,"I really looked forward to reading this book and became very disappointed when half way through the book I started to skim read. I felt Jenna was too submissive she became very boring and I found my self wishing she would just shut up. She said I'm sorry on almost every page. There were too many pages written for 1 scene, and I did not feel that Clint and Jenna had the same chemistry that Asa and Elizabeth had or Cougar and Mara from the other Promises books."
5,excellent introduction into Ayurveda,"I have been really pleased with the Ayurvedic Cookbook! It gives an excellent introduction into Ayurvedic nutritional theory, along with a self-exam so that you may determine your Dosha. There is a great index in the back which lists all foods according to their Dosha which makes menu planning easier. For the most part, the recipes are tasty and easy to prepare. You may find it difficult, however to locate some of the unique Indian spices and food items, especially if you are not living in a large metropolitan area. I did not care for some of the recipes as they were a little strange to my taste, but most were excellent!"
4,Great recipes!,"This is a fantastic cookbook for experienced cooks wanting to explore both Indian cooking as well as Ayurvedic cooking. I've learned a lot about the appropriate use and balance of traditional Indian spices.However, if you are relatively new to cooking, you may find the recipes to be a bit difficult. They are pared down for those who are more intuitive with cooking, but you will not have a step-by-step guide on how to do each task, like you might find in grocery store recipe magazines or Betty Crocker cookbooks. I have also run across occasional omissions of ingredients in the directions, and some of the grain recipes call for too much water (way too much).On the whole, this book has a great net benefit. In fact, it's the only book I've been using for the last 3 weeks. Indian grocers sell incredibly affordable pantry items, and the food is simply wonderful. Please give this book a try!"
5,"Good Tastes, Love and Wisdom","This cookbook has been one of my favorites ever since it first came out in 1990. Now 15 years later, it is ripped, worn, bent, curry stained and I'm buying a new copy. The recipes taste great, have greatly enhanced my family's health and vitality and been enjoyed by many friends. But it's not just a cookbook. The authors bless us with an Ayurvedic perspective on diet, constitution, lifestyle and body/mind/spirit healing and also clarify contemporary health issues related to sugar, dairy products and soyfoods in the light of ancient wisdom. This book is beautifully written, intelligently conceived and vibrates with wisdom and love."
4,A good book for ayurvedic cooking...,"In general, this is a good book. I return to it every now and then. Only inaccuracy I've found is that neem leaves are referred to as curry leaves which is not the case! Neem leaves (Azidirachta indica) are not the same as curry leaves (Murray koenigii - my favourite plant!); they're intensely bitter (make a good tea), whereas curry leaves are more fragrant."
4,Helpful and Interesting,"This book may appear unassuming and simple, but it contains a wealth of information. For those who are familiar with Indian cuisine, it may not be helpful, but for someone starting out or looking to dabble, this book is ideal.There aren't any pictures, but, in reality, none are needed."
4,The Ayurvedic Cookbook,"Clear, concise explanations of the Ayurvedic practice and lots of good recipes. I found this book very interesting and helpful."
4,Superb,"I fell in love with all things indian when i had the opportunity to visit India in Late october last year. The smells and sounds of india are forever embedded in me. When I first went to to the local ayurvedic doctor for a cure for my sinus, i never expected to see results, but I did. I now am a total believer and this is my first cookbook on the food of Ayurveda.Extremely simple, and easy to create recipes, and mmmmm quite delicious too"
4,Good for Ayurvedic recipes,"I bought this cookbook after a trip to India. I used it a lot at first. The recipes and information are ""accessible"" for an American. I'm not eating Ayurvedicly anymore, but I did find it useful and it had tasty recipes."
4,One great novella and 2 more,"Read this book for the first novella in it: ""The term paper artist"" which is perfect, no less. In this novella, Leavitt combines autobiographical details with what seem to be pure fiction. However, no one can know for sure. The novella is fascinating, daring, in my opinion even revolutinary. The other 2 novellas are nice, but nothing like the first one."
3,Not Leavitt's best day,"The first story here, ""The Term Paper Artist,"" is little more than a piece of gay erotica. ""The Wooden Anniversary"" is a return to hold characters and is written in a very wooden manner. ""Saturn Street,"" is a good story, but unusual to Leavitt, the writing falls flat. Give him time; this is Leavitt's return after a slump inspired by a lawsuit (which you'll get a pretty good idea about upon reading ""The Term Paper Artist."" Pass."
2,Arkansas,"I've read almost every novel and short story collection that Leavitt has written. This one was a disappointment on the whole. The most affecting story was Saturn Street. The Term Paper Artist was the wish fulfillment of a middle aged gay intellectual. The Wooden Anniversary was a real mishmash. I really think that Nathan and Celia should take a vow of silence by now.Leavitt always can conjure up lots of heat. In his best work like Lost Language of the Cranes and Equal Affections, he can create touching characters and emotionally involving plots. I do hope that he has gotten his rocks off in Arkansas and goes on from here."
2,A disappointing read in the gay fiction genre,"While David Leavitt comes highly recommended, I was not impressed. ""Arkansas"" is my only experience with his writing and I can't help but wonder what the fuss is about. The teasing ""The Term Paper Artist,"" where Leavitt creates a fictional unscrupulous version of himself, is nothing more than a soft-core wank job. Hunky straight college boys dropping their drawers for a nerd that writes them (gay-positive) term papers? Puh-leeze! Sounds like something out of Blueboy. And the sentimental ""Saturn Street,"" where a man falls in love with the AIDS patient he is delivering lunch to, is just too cliched. My advice: if you HAVE to read this book, check it out from the library."
1,No stars from me - but the computer demanded one!,"I've spent my life reading books and I have to admit to sending this book to the trash can.There is nothing whatsoever of merit in the words, the themes, or the content. What was Mr. Leavitt thinking of ... perhaps he should have waited until he had something to say. I am at a total loss to understand why the minutiae of sexual addiction could be of interest to anyone. I am not a prude, but for heaven's sake, don't give the gay community a bad name by producing such trashy perversion as ""normal"". It's doing those people a gross injustice. I found it a ""penny-dreadful"" which I gladly trashed."
2,This man is teaching our children!,"So, the man who in this book writes about a man who writes A level term papers for failing college students (""The Term-Paper Artist""), and so convincingly I *have* to give him a star for it, is now teaching at the University of Florida and is up for Tenure. How about that."
3,Coverage of Historical and Early Loft Treatment,"As many readers of this title I was looking for interesting, creative, innovative use of loft space. The piece seems complete in its coverage of origin and early treatment. Lofts in several international urban settings are described and pictured. Floor plans for a representative number are presented at the conclusion. By now it has become fairly dated. Present day materials and treatments clearly be an important addition. Surely there has been great progress in the 12 years since the book was released. Secondly, ""adventurous"" lofts were not prevalent. A few several portrayals were bland and unexciting. However, the work seems to be one of the few available resources for those interested in the development of loft space."
4,A Good Review of Organizational Theory,"Jones' text on organizational theory provides the casual reader with a good review of the main currents of thought on that subject. The layout of the material helps readers identify key points easily.This reader found the surprising number of grammar errors, particularly split infinitives, distracting."
2,"Just reprints from Previling Prayer ... by Rev, E.Wigle","I was disappointed when I received this book. I was expecting new lectures by Rev. E.Wigle on conquering prayers on your knees. This book is just a reprint of the first eight lectures from his book ""Prevaling Prayer or The Secret of Soul winning. I really liked that book."
5,Fabulous Femmes,"An amazing romp with some fantastic curves. Voluptuosity personified. Roll over Russ Meyer, here comes the next generation."
4,Good movie,It was a good movie. Kinda artsy for my taste but its good. it has April Flores in it and thats why I bought it.
2,I didn't see much difference,"This product may work for some -- Raquel Welch and Gloria Swanson swear they work -- but I didn't see much difference. The wrinkles would look somewhat diminished for an hour or so after removing them after wearing them overnight, but overall, I didn't seem much change. They might work if one starts using them before the wrinkles are strongly embedded, but I can't say for sure."
3,Are they working? The jury is still out.,"I have been using these for weeks now and I'm not sure if I see any difference in my forehead frown line. Admittedly, my frown line is very deep and the skin is pretty damaged. I have had the wrinkle since my 20's and I am now 40. Botox is so expensive, though!On the other hand, Frownies are easy to use, they're inexpensive and they have no negative side effects. Well, other than they look a little bit silly and you have to soak them off in the shower every morning.These are what people used to call ""Hollywood Wings"". Stars used them before Botox.Frownies has a good website with videos that show how to use the products."
2,Out of shape,"A few years back Frownies came in a sort of wing shape, and it was almost perfect for placement between the eyes.the current ""shape"" is a triangle, which makes no sense at all and has to be cut to fit the area. The edges and points of the new Frownie come loose. So far, after a month, I've seen no difference in the look of the wrinkles between my eyes, but when I remove the Frownie in the morning, there is a red patch which takes awhile to resolve."
2,Horribly designed!,Come on Frownies! You guys need to buy a clue and re-design these things. The first thing i noticed on these were the sharp edges that you have to bend upwards so they don't stab into your skin. You guys could learn something from DermaGen and re-design these with rounded edges. I will not be purchasing these again and would recommend DermaGen Anti-wrinkle patches to anyone wanting to try these. Atleast DermaGen has the more sensible design.
1,"It is useless, it doesn't evev stick",It does not evev stick to my skin!!! How it wanna work!!! It is completely useless!!I didn't like it at all!!
5,very satisfied,i received the product promptly within a few days of ordering and am very satisfied with my results from its use. My brow wrinkle is significantly decreased with only 3 weeks of nightly use! i will definitely be purchasing them again when i run out.
1,Do not be dooped.,Frownies is the old fashion glue back paper tape that you used to mail packages with that had to be wet to stick. The smell and everything is the same. The paper is stiff and does not conform to the roundness of the face. It can cause bumps where the glue is applied to skin and they are not easy to remove. This product is a total hoax.
4,great product,"I use this product about a month and I love it. I am 31 and I have expression lines on my forehead and between my brows and since using frownies I see a big difference. I use it every night and remove them in the morning. easy to use I don't know how they work but they do work for me. I tried few creams but this one is better for me, especially the price."
5,LOVE THESE!,Using these for 6 years-they work better than any expensive cream. Must use every night for best results. Crease between brows kept away with these!
4,Frownies,"I've used these frownies before for the forehead and between the eyes. It seems to work, but you really need to use them every night to get the results that you want."
2,I don't know if it actually works,They are uncomfortable to wear and just not for me. I was not able to wear them as long as it says I needed to do so for results. Perhaps others will have better luck.
4,Work well- better than expected!,I was really surprised after just one use. I totally thought I would have to use this product for at least 3-4 weeks as I read somewhere before. I was so surprised to see my facial lines had softened after just one use. Since I wore them overnight I feel like it retrained my skin to lay more still and not wrinkle or move while I slept. After the first use while I saw softening immediately upon removal of the adhesive from my skin I will say that over time throughout the day my skin went back to normal. I still have hope that after using them for 3-4 weeks that the results may last longer throughout the day. I'm hoping anyway!! Perhaps I'll re-post with another review after that time. I'm really happy with them and at 39 am happy to have found them before turning to botox!
3,not impressed,I really wanted to love this product but it just did not work for me. I did not see any improvements in the fine lines on my forehead and it even caused me to break out in little bumps where I had stuck the little triangles.
5,overnight success!,Frownies are a part of my age fighting arsenal! I have a tendency to frown in my sleep and wake up with a slight furrow between my brows; Frownies remedies this. Highly recommend!!!
4,they work,THey do work and you have to use them every night. I have no problem sleeping with them on.
1,bleh,"The gist behind these is to ""train"" your skin to not wrinkle. Completely ridiculous & in no way helpful."
1,don't bother: a true waste of money and time,I bought these hoping they would work. In a word: NO. They are nothing more than strips of paper with glue on them. If you want to put tape and glue paper on your face at night...go for it.I woke up in the morning with more lines on my forehead..forget it.Better to spend 300 dollars and go to a good dermatologist and get a small amount of botox. It works and you'll look great and you won't have strips of paper to put on your face at night...ridiculous waste of time and money.
1,Really quite stupid,"I didn't realize it was not a pliable material with a regular adhesive. Tried to figure out out to put this hard piece of paper in between my eyes. Had to cut and cut and cut until the shape was correct. Wet it and stuck it. Went to bed, and when I woke up in the morning, found it in my mixed up in my sheets.It's quite a stupid concept. No different than licking a postage stamp and sticking it in between my eyes.Just ordered these as they seem to make more sense:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CQ710U/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details"
5,Botox in a box,"These are amazing, I can't believe I have never heard of them before. Yes they are just craft paper with sticky stuff on the back. But I have completely noticed a difference after wearing them for just a few nights. Great for between the eyes and for forehead wrinkles. I often wake up in the morning with deep set lines and this has totally helped minimize the deepness of those wrinkles!"
5,Great patches!,"I purchased these because of the great reviews, and couldn't find a miracle cream for those lines between my eyes. Great buy but a little uncomfortable at first, especially if you get up in the middle of the night - you want to tear it off and go back to bed - but don't - it hurts and you'll end up peeling some hair off too! Works like a dream but I'm going to try medical tape next just to see the difference...still - I highly recommend!"
4,They Actually Work!,"These Frownies really do work. I have a really deep frown line between my eyes. If applied and worn all night I see a smooth area in the morning. The line will re-develop by afternoon, but doesn't seem to be as severe as it was before. I've been using the Frownies for about 2 weeks. I find them to be comfortable and easy to use. Bonus is that if you rip the thing off in the morning (instead of using water) it saves you from having to tweeze between your eyes!"
4,almost too simple,"It seems almost too simple that sticking a peice of stiff paper between your eyebrows would work but it really does. A very simple, inexpensive item that does produce results. I wish I had known about these sooner."
1,Frownies made me frown,"I don't get how these things work, they are basically just kraft paper perforated into triangles with glue on the one side. Don't waste your money on these things."
1,my skin hated it,"Ihave used this for about a week. I now have ""expression lines"" and a red spot of irritated skin on my forehead. ""fail"""
4,"not a magical, overnight cure but there IS a difference","A friend of mine tried these and sweared that they worked, so decided to give them a try on those dreaded ""angry lines"" between my eyes. I was honestly surprised & pleased to see that the lines weren't as bad as usual, when I woke up the night after first trying them. Usually, upon waking, those lines are much deeper and then smooth out a little bit during the day, but it never occurred to me that sleeping was making them worse, more so than just day to day.I can see how these would take a commitment, they only really seem to do good the day after you've worn them over night. But I HATE those lines, so I'll take what little (natural) difference I can get. They do also take a little practice to get them to stay on, but I haven't had any trouble since the second time. I think I can even let my bangs grow out now! I've always kept them just to hide those lines."
2,Sticks to head- no visible difference,I can see how MAYBE this product works for a person with very very deep wrinkles... using this every night may lift some of the indentations. I have very minor forehead wrinkles and this product does absolutely NOTHING for me. I would suggest not wasting your money.
4,This product is great!,"I have been using frownies for many years. i wear it overnight. Although it does not totally eliminate the frown lines in between my eyes, it helps smooth it out which makes it less visible. it also helps train the muscle to relax preventing the wrinkle to deepen. Sometimes i use frownies when i run outdoors when it's sunny, i just conceal it by wearing a cap. I love this product and i will keep on using it."
3,The jury is still out...,"I've been using these for about 3 weeks now...not really sure what to think yet. I can see the logic behind them - keep the muscles from activating & there's less reason to crease. However, they recommend you use them overnight - & I wonder how much I'd be wrinkling my forehead while sleeping without them. Also, I don't see how I'd ever get to the point where I wouldn't need to use them every night & it'd just be maintenance. In the morning when I remove them, I do see a difference. But the difference seems incredibly short-term.I will continue to use them for now, but jury is out as to whether I think they work as advertised. Leaning towards no.UPDATE: Stopped using them. They did nothing in the long run."
3,Not what I hoped for,"I used this product as recommended, and at first it really seemed to work great... But after about 3 weeks, it just stopped working, and it made my forehead breakout in many large pimples (my forehead rarely breaks out..so I know it had to be the product). I am using the ANSR: Beam light therapy device now, with MUCH better results."
1,Quality Has Decreased,"My first box worked great: lessened forehead furrows temporarily, stayed on all night, felt like really firm construction paper, were difficult to remove. I would have to wet and slowly peel to remove. Second box: didnt help much bc they often came off, felt flimsy. I have to glue 3 together to get the same effect. Very disappointed. I think company changed paper and glue. I wont continue to use."
1,brown package tape,"WOW.....this is seriously the biggest ripoff ! This is nothing but cut up pieces of brown packaging tape (the kind UPS uses when send the box). I did give it a try and then went to the local hardware store to buy a roll of brown paper tape....guess what, it worked the same as ""Frownies"" as was a lot cheaper. Look at the box ... is there anything to describe what the ""magic ingredient"" is? Don't waste your time or money."
5,Improvement even for an old lady.,"I am 68 years old with sun damage from my youth. I can see where Frownies has helped even my tired skin. It is not a facelift, but small changes are noticeable after about 3 weeks. I will reorder, for sure. I have my 50th high school reunion this year, and want to look good for that, so everything helps!!"
5,NOT Just Packing Paper!,"I've been using these between my eyes for the 11 that showed up about a year ago (I'm 53, so I guess I've been lucky until now). Yes, they feel like packing paper, but they've got something else in them cause after they dry on your skin, they feel VERY hard, which probably explains why they work. I've used them nightly for about 2 weeks now, and the 11 is starting to disappear. You definitely should wear them overnight. They're comfortable and stay on all night.I also tried the ones for around the mouth, but haven't seen any results. This is probably because, after they dry, they're also very hard and you can't open your mouth. I must talk in my sleep because I always wake up and find that both pieces have fallen off my face!I'm sticking with just eliminating the 11 between my eyes."
1,Don't Buy This Product!!!,I can't believe how those people possibly gave 4 or 5 stars on this product. I ordered it because 77 people gave good reviews. Please don't buy it. It's really nothing more than packing tape except for the color. I strongly agree with TruthSeeker's review.She mentioned exactly what I wanted to say.
2,NOT A GREAT PURCHASE,I purchased the frownies and tried them a few times. I don't like how they feel and I didn't see much of a difference.
1,wast of money..,"idea maybe good but one of the worst product i ever ordered from amazon..they r like paper strips,wet it and stick it on your wrinckle. they dont even stick, corners pops up and get hard on skin. its like i use glued paper on my face.. taking it off is hard and after all this no good result..really what a wast. i should have send it back but i was traveling and did not get time to return.."
2,It hurts a little,The patches are stiff and uncomfortable. I don't like how you have to wet them before use. I prefer Furlesse. They are a bit more expensive but worth it.
4,This product is useful,"Frownies really help me to control frowning through the night. This is so important because that is what leads to the eleven lines. They also amazingly retrain the muscels so that you are not squeezing between the eyebrows during the day as much. Go to frownies website to see how that works. I have been using this product for about a month now, and noticed differences in my frowning habit right away, but the line that I had is still there that hasn't gone away yet, don't know if it will. I do recommend it and you get a lot of the little patches so your good for a long time, and its not expensive. Delivery was on time, all in all very good."
1,"It does not do anything to attenuate lines, in addition is dries my skin and leaves a red mark!","I definitively would not recommend the patches. It is a substandard product. It's uncomfortable and leaves a dry red mark on the skin after removal. In addition, I could not see any improvement in the appearance of the fine lines between my eyes. It was a complete waste of money!"
4,Cute candles,"I got this as a gift for my sister-in-law who is a huge fan of the Nightmare Before Christmas movie. These candles were very cute and were shipped fast (especially in light of the holiday season). She loved them! My only negative was that the box looked beat up and used but the product was unharmed and in pristine condition. I would have returned since it was a gift but it was so close to Christmas that I kept it. I was a little embarassed about the condition of the packaging but once she saw the candles she didn't care what the box looked like. Overall, very cute and anyone who loves the movie will love this candle set!"
3,Has to be Replaced,"Well, we used to keep our guinea pigs outside in the day and took them in at night when my brother took care of them temporarily. Well, to make a long story short, the roof rats sniffed my piggies out and chewed through their plastic bottle. Then this bottle came in. At first this bottle was GREAT. Now, a few months have passed, and it stopped dispensing water. If you are willing to get it and replace it every few months, go ahead. 3 stars because it IS chew proof, and it DID help in an emergency."
5,These are so nice,"I have two rats, and they go through water quite quickly. I decided instead of buying a huge water bottle I'd get a second one of these nice glass ones. Some people complained on other sites that their animals cannot get water out of them, I have NOT had this problem. I have a feeling some may be filling them too full, not allowing the air exchange to occur.My rats have no issues getting water from these, and because they are glass they can be put in the dishwasher. The attachment system is sturdy, and easy to remove the water bottle to fill. The little duckie inside shows the water level easily. I would imagine for a child's pet, this would make it easier for a child to know when they need to fill it. I just enjoy the cute factor however as I don't have children.TL:DR: This water bottle holds up nicely, can be put in the dishwasher, and is chew proof!"
1,Not worth the money.,"I just finished viewing the DVD. It just goes over the main topics equivalent to just reading the topics of the chapters and moving on. If you really want to pass this test you need to read the book, so if you like a HTML version e-book feel free to buy,otherwise it is cheaper to purchase the book."
1,"tacky, cheap journal",I was misled by the information on the Amazon website regarding this product. By the image and the product information that I saw I was under the impression that it was a beautiful leather-bound journal. However the actual product is far from that. The cover is flimsy cardboard on which has been printed a faux leather-look cover. the pages are nothing special either. if you're looking for a classy journal to spill your thoughts and memories into skip this one. You'd do well to buy an artists journal from the art supply store for half the price.

5,Cool Toy,"I bought this for my 3 year old boy, he loves it. It came in almost assembled. Not a big deal to put together. Good deal for the price."
5,Very Fun!,"We enjoy this car! We have had it for over a month and my 3 year old son loves it. He is taller than average and fits in it great (on one of the smaller settings). He did not know how to pedal before this car, but quickly figured it out and now pedals even on his little bike. He loves the steering action and likes to drive on roads we draw on the driveway with sidewalk chalk. My 8 year old daughter enjoys it too (she's a little big for it lengthwise when it is on the largest setting but she can still pedal it#. All our neighbor kids take turns on it even though they are 10-12 year olds, #they are under the weight limit). We are very happy with it and highly recommend it."
5,he's good a reminiscent of elvis,"thanks to cd-dvd david foster and friends,from there i learned about this guy,he should do more dancing!!!"
3,"Is this ""Frank Sinatra revisited""?","Michael Buble's impersonated singing of Frank Sinatra is definitely ""kluggie"" and all of the women in the audience trying to grab on to him and kiss him is ridiculous. The best component of this presentation was the orchestra."
1,scratched by design,"the cd case has a loose plastic circle in the middle. So, the CD's easily come loose and get scratched. don't by this product."
1,Frank must be turning in his grave...,"I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album ""Songs For Suicidal Lovers"", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: ""...aural film noir...delve into the dark side..."""
5,Superb,"You get the best of both worlds with Michael's ""Caught in the Act"": a CD with some of the songs from the live concert and, of course, the DVD so you can see Michael's superb performance. Thank God a young singer finally came along who appreciates the great standards of yesteryear and who sings them superbly. You couldn't ask for anything more. Bravo Buble."
5,Great DVD,One of the best live concert DVD's. Worth every penny. The first one we received was defective. Amazon replaced it quickly and the return process was very painless. Picture and sound quality is excellent. The music is fantastic. You can't go wrong with this DVD from Amazon.
5,Buble shows he's no ordinary Joe,"CD portion - 8 songs sung live and in concert including the smash hit Home. Flawless in his delivery, Michael Buble conjures up memories of a young Elvis crossed with the smoothness of Dean Martin and the zest of Bobby Darin. Being recorded live is the ultimate test of a singer's true ability and Buble makes it clear that he has pipes of velvet.DVD portion - 15 songs packed with energy and raw emotion - as mentioned previously, to be note perfect AND recorded live is a testament to this man's talent. The banter that runs between the audience and Buble is sweet - Buble has that 'It' factor - he's very charismatic and charming and his love of live performing awesome to behold. He's no ordinary Joe, that's for sure!"
2,So So,"I haven't watched the video. The CD is O.K. I really only like about 3 songs on the CD. I think he tries to imitate Sinatra too much, and then goes overboard when he attempts his own style. Amazon delivered promptly."
2,Michael Buble,I hated this dvd. The only reason I gave it two stars is because when he is singing it's great. I was very disappointed that it didn't have a song menu so you could jump from song to song. It was unbearable to listen to his banter with the audience/camera man. Too immature! I would have been fine if he were not trying to be so cutsey. Seems like he's full of himself. Would not recommend it for that reason.
2,Sinatra at his worst,"I love early Sinatra. Not the stuff with Harry James, which is mediocre, but the early stuff with Tommy Dorsey, which is great. Later, Sinatra lost his voice to alcohol, cigarettes, and general dissipation, and adopted a style that attempted (not very successfully) to disguise the fact that he could no longer sing. Buble imitates the later Sinatra, after he could no longer sing. Maybe Buble can sing. I've listened to several whole albums, in the snippets provided by Amazon, and I'm sorry to say, not one track provides any evidence that he can sing at all, unlike early Sinatra. So if you actually like Sinatra, post voice, you might actually like Buble. But if you liked the earlier warm, intimate, sincere Sinatra sound, you'll hate Buble, as I do."
5,MICHAEL BUBLE!!!!!!,"The closest you will get to an in person experience. Love, love, LOVE IT !!! If you have never experienced this talented man's singing, please give this a try.If you like the old crooners, you will love this DVD. Not enough Stars to rate this item!***********"
5,BELLISSIMA!!!,"A great CD and DVD package that is well worth including in one's music library. Michael does a wonderful job of singing old standards including some of Sinatra's hits. What most have left out of their reviews is the beautiful duet between Michael and the gorgeous Italian diva, Laura Pausini. One who truly admires Laura will really be in for a treat in the DVD. Her entrance down the steps and joining Michael singing Lew Rawls' hit, ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" oozes sex personified. Having lived in Sicily for six years allowed me to listen to a wide array of Italian singers. Ms. Pausini is tops and does Michael well in the duet. I recommend those who enjoy Laura check out her album sung entirely in English, ""From The Inside Out"" on the Atlantic label."
5,Bitten by the Buble bug!!!,"I recently saw Michael Buble perform live and he was Magnificent. Words cannot describe the energy he brings to the stage. His voice, his energy, is personality is all amazing, He's a funny and an absolutley handsome guy!! Would definatley LOVE to see him again live. I'm In Love with Buble!!!! This DVD is wonderful. brings me back to the concert and wish I was back there again. Michael Buble has a way of making you feel he's singing only to you!Thanks Micheal, You are talented and a wonderful entertainer in a time where talent lacks in the music world! It's nice to see someone who can genuinely sing and put on a fantastic show!!"
5,Caught in the Act is Excellent,"If you missed this concert on PBS when it aired, this set is well worth the price. Buble is in fine form and the audio and video on the disk do justice to the performance. This DVD is especially good if you have a good 5.1 sound system and a wide screen TV. The DVD is the compilation of two shows recorded at the Wilturn Theater in Los Angeles. The main difference between this disk and the PBS special is the ending. The Chris Botti guest appearance is the last song on the PBS special while on the DVD it is part of the bonus material."
5,4 Words to describe this DVD package: Ex Cept Tion Al,This combination package is Exceptional and would appeal to everybody who appreciates quality of sound and visuals and loves being fully engaged and entertained. Buble is a stunning performer and captures you from his 1st appearance on stage and the perfect first note. Add the cd of songs and it's a winner all round
2,MICHAEL BUBLE / CAUGHT IN THE ACT,"VERY Disappointed! the songs on the cd, that was the reason for ordering it, are NOT on the CD, but on the DVD that won't play, as it is from the wrong region. That's not to say that the songs he sings on the CD are not good, but there are only 8. Guess I'll put this one in the yard sale and order another!"
3,Little dissapointed,I still cant play it on my DVD player due to the fact that it is from london. Need info on how I can play it here in the US.
1,Rude and crude,I was so disappointed with the performance. Michael looks so classy but is so rude and crude when talking to the audience. I was so offended I threw the CD and DVD away!
5,Caught In The Act,If you like Jazz this CD is outstanding. The clarity and quality of Michael Buble's performance is simply marvelous.
5,ALL TECHINCAL BOOKS SHOULD BE WRITTEN THIS WAY,"It took me only 10 minutes of thumbing through the book in the shop before I decided to buy it. I have just read it cover-to-cover and can categorically state that it covers its subject matter superbly. Although it is a hefty 1000-page tome, the text is lucid and written in a no-nonsense style. It gets right down to business with numerous (and accurate) tables, diagrams and screen shots. This book will teach you everything you need to know about troubleshooting TCP/IP. If you are thinking of buying such a book, you can't go wrong with this one. Congratulations to the authors and Novell Press."
4,fun via New York,"much more upbeat and listenable than ""echoes"" despite the prior album's great singles. this album is less schizo than echoes yet has the same vibe. great to play loud in a car."
3,Not for me,"Musically The Rapture is a breath of fresh air. Good non-electronic dance music is a rarity these days. (not that I dislike electronic music) Unfortunately, buying this was a complete waste of money for me. The album is full of profanity including the f-bomb multiple times. I often listen to music with family including my kids. There is no way I would play this. This really should have had an explicit lyrics warning on it. I guess I should have done more research. I will be selling this CD or trading it in."
1,soulless,"It's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud. There is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record. The songs feel like poor B sides to the original album, and while nobody ever claimed them to be geniuses they WERE catchy, but even their keen pop sensibility is pretty much lacking here. Slightly amusing for one spin, but in the long run utterly fogettable. Not even worth your time to illegally download."
4,"Tony Curran is delicious, as usual, and Red Road shows why he deserves more attention","This movie was different, to say the least. Initially slow moving, the pace picks up when the lead character, Jackie, encounters the man, Clyde(played by the delicious and ginger, Tony Curran)who she believed was still imprisoned for his role in destroying part of her life. Jackie becomes obsessed with confronting Clyde, but spends most of the film slowly building up the courage, first stalking, and then resorting to a more subdued form of vengeance before the final honest confrontation they both need to heal.*This movie has some pretty graphic sex scenes."
3,"engaging, ultimately unsatisfying","What this film does right, it does wrong: its direction and pacing and cutting, the surveillance cameras, the close-ups, all the usual gimmicks, frankly -- suggest something more, some kind of modern-day Rear Window. In fact, the film is none of that, and is far less, however well-crafted. It's a straightforward revenge drama. The entire surveillance angle, which is a major theme, has nothing to do with anything, other than to mask the film's ordinariness."
3,"Slow-paced, but ultimately worthwhile","I wondered if they really do have these surveillance cams everywhere in urban Glasgow? How Big Brotherish, if so! Why would criminals do anything in the open, if they have these? Anyway, this film spends long minutes with no dialogue and little action, as we wonder why the heroine is so depressed. I had to turn on the English sub-titles to understand the thick Scotch accents. I recommend you do the same. The film does reach a shattering conclusion if you stick with it."
3,good but a pity,Surprisingly the film held my attention despite the lack of action while she was spying due to good pace and acting. I thought why she was spying will be revealed in good time. IT WAS NOT. Luckily there was an ipod nearby to click on amazon to get the answer and continue watching or I would have got very very annoyed.I liked being surprised by the sex scene. It mirrored Jackie's surprise too. After watching so much bleakness most of the film it was welcome.One criticism- Clyde would have run a mile after what she tried to pull even if she didn't. Seeing as the film was almost ducumentary in its realism this was a let down. Better to have found another way to confront him.I might have found it more interesting than it was having lived in Glasgow for over a year- I was curious to see the poor parts i never saw having lived in the quaint parts.Not sure how well the film can hold other people's attention otherwise ditto IT WAS NOT.........
4,"Strong film, somewhat disappointing finish.","""Red Road"" is an unsettling film about a woman who works as a security guard, watching closed-captioned cameras all day long, who stalks a man recently released from prison. Filmmaker Andrea Arnold is quite talented; what's on screen is a combination of strikingly realistic, grubby Glasgow and moody, disquieting interiors. It's gripping till you get to the end, and commendable for creating characters of real interest and sympathy, but the resolution of the story, without giving it away, is unfortunately a bit facile, not entirely credible, and too obviously marked by symbolization. In all a very good film that leaves us looking forward to more from all involved."
2,Says it's widescreen but it's not !!,"a great film. truly amazing!! but i hate films, like this one, that are ""modified to fit your screen"", even though on the box it's described as anamorphic widescreen 2.40. A 5-star film in a half-star format!!! they (Tartan) need to re-transfer/release this dvd!! and the cheesy art-work....what up with that??"
5,Beware Spoilers in other 'reviews'!,"Red Road is a brilliant, emotionally draining piece of work. It doesn't need any more kudos from me to secure its reputation. BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE avoid the petulant, brattish ""Kid's Review"" dated April 5th, the unpleasant little troll gives away a HUGE plot spoiler that isn't revealed until the end of the film. Hopefully, if you're reading this page you've already treated yourself to one of the best European movies in years. If not, read no more about the movie, from any source, and give in to its extraordinary dark power.One other caveat: as another reviewer points out, the US DVD is NOT REPEAT NOT anamorphic widescreen. It's full-frame, and frustratingly crops actors out of the frame at key moments. That Andrea Arnold's movie survives this treatment is a testament to her talent. And no wonder Tartan Films has gone out of business."
4,Loads of fun,"I had a chance to see this novel before publication, and it's informative, amusing and quite well done. Should more than satisfy any fan of the genre."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"Not very well written. This tries to take advantage of the Bolitho, Ramage, etc genre but places it in the new US Navy, 1790-1800. The verbage is silted and the situations illogical. I read about half of it and gave it away to Goodwill. And I'm sorry I did that."
3,Great music badly rendered,"Either you like Herb Alpert or you don't. It's that simple. I do. Ever since I heard his ""Lonely Bull"" theme in the early sixties. I treasure my record albums since most of them are still not available on CD. This album was supposed to be replacing the oldest Alpert LP album in my possession. Finally without any clicks and hiss. Unfortunately not so. The clicks are gone, but a lot of tape hiss was added. A great opportunity lost. I have copied the CD tracks to my PC, removed the constant hiss and re-recorded it. Now *that*'s an improvement. But I think the CD is not near the LP original in quality."
1,Sent it back - don't bother ordering it,"First, I really don't take the time to write reviews unless something is either really horrible or really awesome about the product. This dartboard arrived damaged at the corners, the pine frame evidently bangs/dings up fairly easy due to its poor construction. the backing is medium density fiberboard (MDF) which is poorly mounted to the pine frame with additional mdf shims. The pine frame and mdf is all fastened with glorified staples. its light, its cheap, but its also poorly constructed so we didn't even try to hang it on the wall. Once we opened the box, we knew it should be sent back. Guess that's what you get for one of the cheapest backboards out there."
3,2 years and still holding up,"I've had this backboard for over 2 years now, and I play several hours per week. Since I knew I was going to use it alot, I modified it slightly. When installing the dartboard center mount, I didn't think it would be secured sturdy enough, so I secured a 1/2 inch thick piece of scrap plywood I had. It worked perfectly. For the price, it's worth it."
2,Mediocre at best,"Its shown with a natural wood trim but the item arrived with a very poor blotchy medium brown stain. It almost looks like they didn't finish staining the item in the corners. I bought this because of DMI's reputation in quality dart boards but not the case here. It was poorly packed and arrived with some minor scratches. Low quality, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not what it's made out to be.,"I have had read a lot of review about this movie but frankly I was disappointed. It is gory for the sake of being gory but unfortunately the effects are only mediocre.So absolutely no ""shock"" effect. It is a cult film so it's a must have for collectors of the genre out-there."
1,Very few redeeming qualities,"This movie has no plot, no story, no investment in characters. It is basically a nasty autopsy with some necrophilia thrown in. Disturbing? Yes. Worth watching? No, not really. I'm a huge horror fan and the gorier the better but this movie (or really three shorts) just has (have) no redeeming qualities. If you get the chance to watch it for free, have at it as it is not a large time investment; however, don't bother to pay money for it as it simply isn't worth it."
5,Review applies to Aftermath only,Well what can I say?Nacho Cerda's only reason to make this is to shock and offend and he pulls it off great. No doubt one of the sickest short films ever made. The only thing I would complain about would be the length. Worth the money if you're a gore-hound like me.
1,Porn movie for necrophiliacs : Aftermath,"No story, just necrophil splatter scenes. I wasnt shocked just bored. Its not a masterpiece like Buttgereits Nekromantik stuff ( these have a story)Rent it, watch it one time and give it back........greetz"
1,Garbage. Horrible effects. Dont believe the hype.,"I heard about this flick years ago but at the time it was an obscene cost to buy.So finally I looked and found just 2 weeks ago. Wow what trash.I dont know how anyone could be shocked or upset after watching.The bodies were fake as hell. In no way looked real. Only one body that of a man with a Italian stash, but you will see no actual cutting was near this guy, just clever film cutting.I was expecting awesome effects but this looks beyond trash. Maybe this was cool back in the 80's when the crap was filmed but this stands to be more of a joke than anything. Right down to the horrible dog at the start of this crap.Even when he was humping the body, keep your hands to your sides and save the paper towles, if thats your kind of thing. Cuz it was so sexless and stupid. Her chest was open. It wasnt like he had sex with the woman. It was that of an open wound. Dumb.Save your time."
2,My mistake,Didn't review the content enough up front and was disappointed with the material. I had visited Austria recently and wanted to know much more about Maria Theresa. This wasn't the book for that. It was more about the military decisions that formed the Hapsburg empire than about the woman who reigned for so many years. Will look for another to find what I'd like to read.
5,Holy Crap!,Go! has to be the best song i have ever heard!!!! OMG i cant wait for the movie! it's gonna be so goooooood!Peace!
3,"An OK soundtrack, a good movie!","I just got finished watching ""Jump In!"", and it was a really good movie! I DVR'd it. The Jump In! soundtrack is an ok soundtrack. I really like ""Jump To the Rhythm"", ""Push It To the Limit"", and ""It's My Turn"". For the rest of the soundtrack, it is ok, but I would still consider buying it."
3,It's OK,"The kids (4 and 9) really wanted this based on a couple of tracks they'd heard, but as it turned out they only liked those two tracks. Better to download just the songs you like."
5,Nazareth still ROCKS!,The only ones who DON'T like this one is the neighbors! Play this CD at max volume for the full effect! I'm pleased!
5,Great Quality,This was exactly what we needed and looks great installed. I added two flange tabs with rivets to make it easier to mount to a floor with carpeting. We are very pleased with the purchase at a great price.
2,Low-Budget Disappointing Urban Movie,"2 G's & a Key is your typical, straight-to-video urban flick. The story involves Curtis (played by Conroe Brooks) getting back into the drug game after spending several years in prison. To make matters worse, he has to deal with a dealer he double-crossed, other vengeful dealers, and shifty women.The story is unoriginal, and the acting is downright terrible. The film is written and directed by Paul Wynne, whose portfolio includes a number of other low-budget movies that went straight to video.The only reason why I gave the movie two stars instead of one is because of the decent comedic performance by Warren, Curtis' trusty sidekick. The irony is that I can't recommend the actor, because he had his name replaced with a pseudonym in the film's credits out of embarrassment. The only thing I like about this movie is that it's so bad, it's intentionally entertaining."
3,"ANOTHER GANGSTA MOVIE, BUT IT IS PRETTY GOOD","AFTER SPENDING 3 YEARS IN PRISON, AN EX-CON TRYS TO GIVE A DRUG DEALER SOME MONEY THAT HE OWES HIM. BUT INSTEAD, THE DEALER WANTS TO KILL HIM. THE ACTING WASN'T ALL THAT GREAT, BUT THE MOVIE'S ACTUALLY OK. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST GANGSTA MOVIES TO HAVE COME OUT IN THE PAST 5 YEARS. IT'S WORTH RENTING."
3,Lacking something,"I looked forward to this book - I have all of Ms. Stuarts books from way back when and always eagerly await the next -whether it be suspense, regency, contemporary, etc...She can write brilliant characters, conflict, sexual awareness, and emotional scenes like no other. Usually her books leave me thinking about them for weeks and even months.This book however disappointed. The usual sexual tension and awareness between the two lead characters wasn't there. Neither the plot or the characters relationship drew me into the story. I read it and felt let down. High expectations and then ""Pfff""...no sizzle. Hopefully I will enjoy her next book more."
1,BORING!,I began this book with hope that I would enjoy it. After the first 3 or 4 pages I knew it was going to be a stinker. I read Lord of Danger and it was fairly good. Seriously don't bother.
4,The perfect example of Stuart's style and genius,"This is the consummate Anne Stuart and a perfect example of her style and her genius. Dark, unlikable heros written so well you fall in love with them in spite of their sins. Plain, ordinary heroines whose courage and moxy knock those heros for a loop!"
4,"Real rake, not a fake!","This book was very good! Christian was the real deal. A rake that was actually developed as such. His speech and actions stayed true to his character. I also loved the fact that Annelise's rival and charge wanted him for his looks and nothing more. It was very believeable since he was dead broke.Annelise was a great heroine. She didn't let her charge walk all over her like they do to the governesses in most romance novels. And it was hilarious that a plain spinster such as herself had such a foul mouth.I wouldn't have mind Christian and Annelise spending a little more quality time to get to know one another better, instead of just stealing kisses here and there, and I would have liked the villian to have a little more dept, but I cannot deny that I really enjoyed this book."
1,EINS ZVEIN POLIZEI,I JUST WNAT TO HEAR IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I HAVE LONG TIME THAT I HA NOT HEAR IT.
5,football lovers,I bought two honor roll series for my two boys (who are football freaks) and they loved it! It's a great addition to any collection.
1,Buyer beware - only a single Mighty Mouse episode on DVD!,"Although the cover picture and the title of this DVD might lead you to believe that there is a lot of Might Mouse material on it, the truth is that only the very first cartoon (Wolf-Wolf) is a Mighty Mouse episode which lasts only a couple of minutes. The DVD contents should really have been listed since you have no idea what you are getting when you buy this DVD. The only reason I wanted this DVD was Mighty Mouse and I have to say I am sorely disappointed."
5,gut-wretching guitar and vocals,A must buy for fans who missedit the first time around. Brian pours out his heart andsoul on a solo debut album like no other artist has donebefore. Great music that nevergrows old.
3,Decent effort that got no support from the record company,"Having followed Brian Setzer's Stray Cats career from a somewhat bemused distance, I didn't expect all that much from his first true solo effort. Back then I used MTV as background music when I was down to crunch time on whatever paper I had due, and it was during one of these marathon typing sessions that I first heard and saw ""The Knife Feels Like Justice"". Expecting more along the lines of the Cats, I was shocked to find that he'd jettisoned that image and sound for more straight ahead rock. Like I said, shocking, but by the first guitar break I was hooked. Bought the album later that afternoon. The rest of the album doesn't quite live up to the title track, and there isn't anything I'd consider a must have for Setzer fans, but only on ""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams"" does it fall flat. A decent album and a surprisingly tough find in cd form."
1,THE KNIFE WOULD BE JUSTICE,"I have never been a ""big"" STRAY CATS fan, but I liked their music, and when Brian stepped out on his own, I had to pick up his cd to see if he would follow the success of his first band. The Knife Feels Like Justice, is a big let down. I bought the cd, not knowing what I was going to get, and what I got was a disappointment. The songs have a good beat, but the vocals and the material, is lacking. There are some descent songs on board, the title track, Chains Around Your Heart, and Bobby's Back. But the rest are really poor. If your a ""cats"" fan, you will be let down, this is not his better work"
1,Don't Buy it.,"This Mini Cooper mat didn't fit. It was way too small, and the vent holes were mostly covered. It was poorly constructed and very flimsy. A complete waste of my time and patience."
3,Nice Product But Does Not Fit a 2005 Mini,"Don't order this product if you have a 2005 Mini Cooper--it won't fit. Amazon's webpage for this item states that this dash cover ""will fit a 2005 Mini Cooper."" However, I was shipped a dash cover that was made to fit a 2002-2004 Mini, per the label on the carton in which it was delivered. Returned it to Amazon for a replacement. Same problem with the second shipment, and again I had to return it. The product/catalog number is correct per the label, but the ""Fit Verifier"" is wrong. Amazon was very good with both returns, and will refund my money."
1,I gave up!,"I've ordered this same exact knife from several different vendors in the past and was always pleased. This time it came from ""Regate"" and it was the wrong knife. I called their customer service number many times, no answer, left many emails, no answer. I asked them to either allow me to exchange the wrong product for the right one, or at least refund me. I did this for about 2 months, til I realized they don't care and aren't going to help me at all. It's been a terrible experience and I won't be ordering from them again, and possibly from Amazon again either."
3,Its Kind of Hard,This game causes frustration for my son because its not easy to play and doesn't come with very good instructions on how to get the characters through certain obsticals but overall he loves it and enjoys trying over and over and over until he gets it. Its fun and the music isn't annoying which makes it fun for me as well.
3,Satisfied,"Shipping was perfect! I received it within 48 hrs after clicking the order button. I also like the really nice CD case included. However, I do not recommend this product for people with a short attention span. It gets VERY repetitive and moves at a really slow pace. This is good for slow learners like myself however, it gives plenty of room for your mind to wander because of its repetitiveness.Also, there is not book to follow along with which would be really convenient for people who learn best via the visual sense. Recommended to be used together with other visual products such as ""Portuguese in 10 minutes a day"" or Rosetta Stone (if you can afford it)."
4,*Girl..,"was a really good movie!! I haven't seen it in years! but I love it, mainly because of Dominique Swain! but can someone explain why it's so damn expensive??"
5,I AM TOTALLY A GROUPIE OF THIS MOVIE,I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE. I STUMBLED UPON IT LATE ON HBO ONE NIGHT AND HAD TO HAVE IT. IF YOU ARE FEELING A LITTLE NOSTALGIC FOR THE SEATTLE SCENE THIS IS DEFINETLY THE MOVIE FOR YOU.
4,Good Movie if not compared to book,"If you are a fan of the book ""Girl"" you will probably not enjoy this movie. The movie leaves out much of the detail in the book which presented a more together, engrossing, and character-rich story. If you can watch the movie as a separate entity from the book, it is enjoyable. The strong point of the film is the excellent cast of many indie film stars like Selma Blair. Portia De Rossi from Arrested Development also has a role in the film. The film still presents a coming of age story that doesn't take itself too seriously."
2,Blake Nelson was robbed!,"As when usually happens when those Hollywood people make a book into a movie, everything the author tried to get across in his work was changed, compartmentalized, and sugar-coated. I realize it's difficult to capture 1/100th of the essence of a TREMENDOUS novel (in 2 hours, no less), and I give this movie 2 stars for trying. If you really liked this movie, read the book, because they changed all the characters in the movie, and it lasts for 3 years of Andrea's life. (We are talking The Catcher in the Rye for teen girls.) If you already read the book (and REALLY loved it), but have not seen the movie, don't bother."
2,A poor interpretation of a good novel!,"While the movie Girl has good intentions, it doesn't come close to capturing the spirit of the novel by Blake Nelson. The book, which reads like a diary, spans several years in Andrea Marr's life. Unfortunately, the movie packs the story into less than a year's time, scraps a good portion of the novel, and leaves many characters, if not all the characters, poorly developed. The story and characters will remind you of My So-Called Life. Andrea and Todd Sparrow, played by Sean Patrick Flannery, are a lot like Angela and Jordan. The movie, however, doesn't match the quality of the show.Dominique Swain is good as Andrea, and the supporting cast, which includes Selma Blair and Tara Reid, is decent, but this movie fails due to bad character development and a choppy story line. Of course, I have read the book so I have trouble reviewing the movie based on it's own merit. If you like this movie, you should definitely read the book, also titled Girl."
2,Horribly Miscast!,"Oh the HUMANITY!...First, the obvious: Tara Reid as Cybill? I don't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor, but it is a mystery how that happened.Secondly, Dominique Swain just didn't act like the Andrea Marr of the book. It seemed like Dominique Swain didn't even read the book before she played Andrea. I also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around, but that's another topic.The movie didn't have any similarities with the ""feeling"" of the book, even though the plot was (roughly) similar.Portia DeRossi as Carla? Ummmm.... maybe?Selma Blair as Darcy sort of worked.The only character I felt was well-cast was Todd Sparrow.Anyhow, I re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie, to try to recapture the feel of the book (and erase the memory of the movie)."
2,Read the book...,"Like most films based on books, the book is usually better. In the case of Girl, this is beyond true. The film hardly resembles the raw and truthful book it is based on except for the fact that the characters names are the same, and situations in the book are touched on. Otherwise, it tries too hard to be cool for the teen audience, and gives all the otherwise talented actors terrible dialouge to work with. Read the book...and Andrea will imerge as more than a rock star-groupie, because in the book, she was. She was a little piece of every teenage girl out there. Read the book, skip the film."
3,could have been..better,"I saw this movie cause I love Lolita. Dominique is a great actress, even tara reid was good... she usually isnt .. but in this she was great. Selma always does a great job. The rest of the cast doesn't. Story is ok. Just not good enough to pay for."
5,this is the best movie,i love this movie so much. when i first watched this movie it moved me it was the only thing i could think about for a week.this love story is very beautiful. i think they did a great job on this movie.
5,"Girl: Yes, you can find the music for this movie!","I LOVED this movie and was amazed that there was no soundtrack, especially when it centered around a (so-called) 'groupie' and the singer of a band! Finally I discovered that there is music available from The Color Green, apparently formed by Jon Kahn who provides the music that Todd Sparrow performs. Find it at mp3.com. You can order the DAM CD's which play like normal CD's as well as on mp3. 2 songs from the movie 'One Step Forward' and 'Girl' appear on ""the color green -- Jon Kahn"" [23587] and the song Cybil sings 'Never' plus 'Blood Brothers' and 'Look my way' are on the ""the color green -- Acoustic"" [71629]. I hope this helps other people who may have loved the music the way I did. Enjoy!"
5,The psychology of being a fan....,"This movie disects the emotions that fans go through, although most fans do not get to fullfill their dreams with the objects of their desire. Swain's character goes from believing that she'll never succumb to the pitfalls of fandom, but falls hard for a rocker portrayed by Flanery. (Who wouldn't?) What unfolds is an endearing coming of age story with many joys and bumps in the road. This was a well acted movie with likeable characters and a plot that many can relate to. The only thing that could have made this film more enjoyable for me would have been to allow Flanery to sing the songs that Todd Sparrow supposedly does (as he sings his own song in ""Raging Angels"")."
4,"Seemingly light and fluffy, but it has a great message!","I thought I'd be a little old for this but I loved it!YES, there are blatant parallels to ""My So-Called Life"" Angela-check. Jordan-check. Rayanne-check. Brian Krakow-check. All the pieces are there, but this is a GOOD thing! (Must Dominique Swain look and act so much like Claire Danes in this movie?)The most important thing, is that, when all is said and done, and we see Andrea lose virginity, come of age, and make an utter fool of herself in the process, she walks away from it all and gets on with her life. This delivers the most important lesson to young girls watching this movie---it's okay to get caught up in it all for a little while, but there comes a time when you grow up and move on. And Andrea learns that the people she most admires, admire her in return. She discovers her own self-worth.Oh, and all the songs by The Color Green (a real band!) can be found on MP3.com!"
4,The Girl meets Boy,"I thought this film was one of the best i have ever seen. All of my friends think it is great too. I think all the actors were great in this film. ... It is great because in real life,we meet someone and admire something in them but we don't realise they might admire something us. I thought it was really sad... I loved all the music,i think there should be a soundtrack with Cybil's song and Todd Sparrow's song on it."
2,Meh ... I've been there,"I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever. But, it failed to impress. I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him. I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much. And my determination paid off! *Patting myself on the back*But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie. The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either. The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise."
4,reality,"I have experienced and learned first-hand what Angela experiences in the film. And that is the ""reality"" of the music business, its stars and how these ""stars"" treat those who love them. Music, and the person who creates it, can affect an individual so much so that the person assumes a role they never envisioned for themself. And the ""truth"" Angela finds about the need Todd Sparrow fulfills in her - and the need she fulfills, briefly for Todd, is right on the mark. I found the acting exceptional, especially Dominique Swain and Sean Patrick Flanery in the lead roles. I LOVED the music! Why isn't there a Soundtrack? Does anyone know what bands and musicians performed, and how I can get their work?"
4,Sensitive and Realistic,"Dominique Swain's portrayal of a groupie is refreshingly youthful and innocent. Sean Patrick Flannery is hot as the boy all fledgling groupies' mothers warn them against. Despite a few teen flick cliches, this film treats the subject with sensitivity and realism, neither minimizing or overly dramatizing the consequences of groupiedom."
4,My Thoughts,"""Girl"" was an okay movie..not the best, but there was something about it that caught me. I really feel it deserves a 3, but because I seem to be fixated on it, it gets an extra star.The narration was magnificent. I liked the way you could hear Andrea's thoughts. The plot was a bit thin, but the movie managed to survive quite well. The whole groupie aspect was interesting and refreshing. The actors portraying the characters did an excellant job. This is the kind of movie where one can just roll with it. It may not top any best seller's lists, but it's worthy of a few viewings.."
4,One to make you think...,"Life is a novel that presents the reader with the quandaries that arise from trying to balance the roles of a working professional and an active member of a family. Anna Senoz starts as an undergraduate student trying to find her place, not only in the scientific community, but also socially. As she progresses through her life she discovers that an obsessive researcher and gifted mind can be both a blessing and a curse...The progression of the book sometimes jumps around in time as you go from the present to long dialogues from sometime in the past. A well written novel - however, there are places that may have been a bit extreme in terms of content for my taste in some places in the book. As a current graduate student this book posed several questions that I often don't stop to think about and sometimes should consider. I don't know if I would call it a ""must read"" but there are several good lessons to be taken and considered from the book."
1,RUST!,"The product certainly looks sleek and pretty when you get it, but as soon as it's touched by moisture (which a toilet brush holder will, invariably, be) rust! Got it two months ago and the entire bottom is now rusted and unsightly."
2,Smaller than expected,"They are about 2/3 the size of regular brushes and stands, but if you're fine with it being smaller, then you'll like them. (Esp. great for tiny cramped bathrooms).You'll find they're cheaper than the silver ones you get at walmart, bed bath and beyond, target, etc, but you also get less of a brush and stand.the bottom section looks a bit stupid since it's not totally in proportion to the skinny body of the cleaner, but I suppose to make it more sturdy they needed a bigger circumference for the base.If I didn't have to pay s&h; it would have been well worth it. So instead of spending about $60 bucks for 4 stands, I spent a little less than $40."
2,Not for me,I LOVE her Dear Jane book but this one I don't like at all. It's mostly applique blocks which are ugly in my opinion. I didn't see any blocks I really cared to spend any time on. The letters to her grandchild were a sweet idea but this book is one of my LEAST favorites.
5,Victorian,"This book was amazing--the premise is what happens when two people marry for money, and then discover neither one has any? Set in Cape May, NJ, this Victorian had me up half the night. Do not start this if you have any work to do!!!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"I have referenced this book on several occasions while dealing with my children's illnesses. This book has kept me from making some serious mistakes with my children, and it has also kept me from putting my children on an endless round of antibiotics for minor things. I have used her wisdom to treat my children on various occasions, and would recommend this book as a household reference for anyone desiring the best for your family."
1,1-1/2 stars -- Movies don't get much wacker than this,"Morgan (Sean Astin) is a dish washer. Anne (Shannon Elizabeth) is a stripper. They both cross paths and eventually fall in love, and Morgan decides he has to leave because love and commitment scares him that much. Does this even sound remotely interesting to you?If it doesn't, you're right. This movie was made for video and it isn't even worth that. I advise everyone to watch something else. (By the way, has anyone else noticed that Shannon Elizabeth has put a ""no-nudity"" clause in recent contracts - and she hasn't worked since?)"
2,"Horribly written, bad acting.","This film failed to capitalize on a good cast and is generally a snooze. Shannon Elizabeth is the one bright spot, though her part is small compared to the two whining dishwashers. I don't think I'll ever see a movie with a plot as ridiculous as dishwashers who roam the U.S. in search of a philosophical ephiphony. Don't waste your time."
3,A Good Rental Movie,"I saw this movie with a bunch of my friends and we all thought that it was a good movie to watch with friends or your mate.It had good actors with ok preformances and direction, and a pretty good story line.The two things that we all thought made this a good movie,were the places where they filmed and the music.Over all I do recomend this movie for rental.My hat off to the producers of this movie or the people in charge of the music and the filming locations."
4,A Good First Vehicle..but that is about it,"Shannon Elizabeth is by far the star of the show in this film. Matthew Lillard was nothing but annoying, and Sean Astin to me was almost as annoying as he was in Rudy. Brian Dennehy, and Richard Moll were about the only other things that kept this film afloat. All too often Astin's character was too transparent, and you constantly cheered for Shannon Elizabeth opposite him. I gave it 4 stars simply because of some nice zingers and fairly well written wit....this was definitely an unpolished film."
3,Mixed feelings,"This is a sort of brisky production of a tango collection. While some of the songs are undeniably beautiful and part of Argentina's tango tradition, their renditions are not as good as the songs deserved. There are better interpreters of Buenos Aires soulful music. However, not everything is just Ok; Piazzola's ""Adiós Nonino"" is worth paying for this CD. For those not familiar with tango, be aware that this is just a collection, that is a small sampling of a humongously rich musical tradition in Argentina. This CD with just 3 interpreters cannot reflect that richness as much as I would have wanted."
3,Good review of many steam engines for modeling.,This is a good overview of mostly standard guage steam engines. There are some good drawings that could be used to create or enhance an engine model. There is very little information on narrow guage and none on two foot guage engines.
5,steam,I purchased this book in the early 1960's and have enjoyed it ever since. I am glad to see it in print again so that another generation can enjoy it also. It contains many illustrations and scale drawings (HO) and I have made several models from it.
3,needs improvement,"Sure it works as designed. Intended to backup your contacts on your phone. Although I had the understanding that I could copy the contacts to my computer and/or import them into Outlook. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong) all I can do is edit and create contacts stored on the cellstick from my computer. I don't see a way to export them to any importable format for my computer. Or copy contacts from Outlook onto the cellstick for transfer to my phone. Not a big deal though, obviously if I need the cellstick to begin with that just means I didn't invest much in my phone in the beginning. I'm learning I just need a new phone."
2,Works - Kind of,"Pro: Very easy to use.Con: For 40 bucks, why didn't they just make it at least a 128 Meg flash drive? It's 128 Kbytes? C'mon! I buy 1 Meg flash drives for 20 bucks.Con: The first time you upload to a LG 4650, it WILL screw up your groups. It over-wrote my custom entered groups and added a bunch of groups in Spanish, of all things. It does not support the 4650 correctly, in other words.Con: As others have noted, no import/export. I kludged an import using excel to edit the .dat file, which is standard CSV format. I bought it for 40 bucks and sold it for 10 to a friend with the same phone as me - after giving him a few warnings."
3,Polycom Soundstation2,"The buttons on the Polycom Soundstation2 are very stiff and sometimes do not come up after being pushed, but we are hoping that they ""settle in"" after a little use. I don't have time to deal with exchanging for another soundstation at this time, so I am hoping it will be fine. Other than that, no problems."
4,Traditional phone,"Good phone, good quality, but if you are thinking to use it as a voip terminal, you have to buy other parts to make it work."
1,Speed Dial Limitation for International Numbers Storage,"Bought a Soundstation 2 for my company...almost everything was perfect....except when I tried to store international numbers in the speed dial, I realised that it can store numbers up to 15 digits only. As the equipment runs on an analog line, we have to dial a prefix-9 + 001 before the international number. Countries like China or India have 12 digits. In total there are 16 digits to dial to China/India. Sad to say it doesn't support companies with global presence."
1,"Average product, crap customer service","We have had this phone for roughly two years, and when it works, it works fairly well... but, the phone would constantly drop its registration and as of recently it will no longer register. Software updates don't work (and are only supported via Windows, hello... 2010!). I called technical support for our $[...] phone and they said that I could pay for assisted troubleshooting and then pay more if a repair was needed... crap service for such a pricey product. Won't buy Polycom ever again."
1,OFFICE MANAGER,"Never received the product.Therefore can't rate but can on ""customer service"". Received a box with totally different item. Called was told they should ship another Polycom Soundstation 2W and would have by Thursday or Friday the latest. It is Monday and still no unit. Called again, said it will ship out today. This is a business transaction and I personally will not use Amazon for any of my persoanl purchases.Disappointed customer"
5,Quality Phone,"This phone is a good quality phone. When on speaker, typically during conference calls, the sound is crystal clear. And the people on the other end have no trouble at all distinguishing your words. I also purchased the 2 additional mics which compliment quite well. If you plan on getting the mics, make sure you get the expandable version of this Polycom SoundStation2. There are many versions that are similar to this one, and it's easy to get them confused. I definitely recommend this phone!"
4,Really exciting,"Great CD, unusual that this band aren't better known. Perhaps they're lazy or drunk, they sound so excited and dark. People who like DFA1979, early 80s electro and anything with that Albini production edge he had back in the 80s should really dig this."
2,So boring my pillow needs a pillow,"I absolutely love history and foreign relations, but this book is written in the most boring style possible. Horrible, I wouldn't recommend it. He has some great points, but you are better off reading the book reviews to get his argument."
2,A compairson of 2 native cultures fighting for a way of life,I was put to sleep three times by this book. Those poor natives. They just can't get no justice. This book does provide a new look at what an injustice western civilation has done to native people.
1,''Bought the wrong book,I couldn't distinguish between the textbook I was supposed to purchase and the one I bought. The covers looked the same.
1,I am very unhappy,"I never received my book. When I finally got the book from another source, I wrote the seller and asked for a credit to be applied to my account. I haven't received that either. I don't know who to contact now to complain to, since the seller hasn't responded to me."
3,Usage in University in NJ,"This is the book that was used for MATH 0150 at Kean University, Union, NJ, USA."
2,do not buy from this seller,"When I received the book, it had 20-30 sticky notes with hairs on them. It was disgusting, considering I paid $43.00 for it. At least the seller should clean it up or inspect the used book before resell it. Would not but anything from them again. This was the first bad product I got from Amazon."
3,Missing CD,I believe this series of books should come with some sort of CD or software. The CD was not included with my book.
4,Begining Algebra,I liked my purchase. The book came in good time and the price I paid was worth the book. There was no writing on the pages and the edges were not horribly worn. You could tell that the book was used prior. This purchase was all good.
3,Beginnng Algebra by Lial,"I like the way this book is laid out. It is a good book to self-learn from. The last time I was looking at an algebra book was over 25 years ago- this book has a lot of color, imagery and relevant information for using algebra. I would like to add that I ordered this book ""express shipping"" and received it nine days later. I thought it would arrive much faster than that, actually."
2,Very dissapointed,I looked at all the offshore clones and decided to buy the original. When it arrived the front and back angle iron rails looked like the steel had been bought at a scrapyard. The finish was rough as though rust had not been removed prior to painting and the paint was already beginning to peel at the interior angles. I couldn't return the fence because I needed it to complete a job and it was accurate and worked fine. The rail that the fence clamped to was well painted.This experience just confirms my opinion of Delta. They have cheapened the unisaw so it is now a light weight shadow of its former self and now they are doing it to the Biesemeyer fence. Too Bad it makes it hard to justify buying North American unfortunately.
1,waiting for resolution,On Dec 13 a claim was filed on this purchase.As of Dec 27th the vendor has not contacted me.
2,Don't buy the DVD!,"I have to say that as a huge Chaplin fan who already owns all of his feature films and shorts on VHS, I was quite disappointed with this DVD of The Kid. Although it does contains a few deleted scenes, these scenes totally disrupt the flow of the soundtrack that Chaplin worked so hard to write. It's chopped to bits! The music starts and stops abruptly, and is not in sync with the action! Save your money and buy the VHS version. I think the 20th Century Fox Centennial Collection is by far the best!"
5,My Favorite!,"This is the most charming, touching, story from that genius little fellow Chaplin! There's one scene in the film that you can never forget. Hauntingly beautiful score written by him to boot, how could one man have so many gifts?"
4,One of my favorites paired with a decent short,"A Dog's Life:A routine Chaplin short - which makes it better than most other silent shorts.The Kid:This may be my favorite Chaplin film. It doesn't have the depth of his later films but the brilliant timing and trust in the audience to understand subtle cues already infuses Chaplin's first feature film, a film which also catapulted Jackie Coogan to preeminence as cinemas first child star. And Coogan set the bar very high for the child stars who followed.The cinematic purity of this film, which simply tells a touching story superbly well without trying to shoehorn in a message or statement, is something I find refreshing 90 years later."
3,Chaplin's First Full-length Feature far from his Best,"This film is quite decent compared with the average comedy of today, but it is far below the level of Chaplin's greatest which were to come a few years later: The Circus, City Lights. The humerous sequences were not all that funny (although they may have been to the audiences during the 1920's). There are a few tedious sequences that do not seem to advance the story ( the fight between the two children, the wierd dream scene). And the grand finale scene is very bland. See the 1931 film: CITY LIGHTS and notice the great difference in quality of humor and storytelling."
4,OK tools,"These are just OK, they will do the job. They are HSS and come with a good edge. The steel seems to be a lower quality high speed steel as they don't hold an edge terribly long. For home or hobbyist use they work just fine. If your are a professional buy something else. For my use I will likely buy again."
1,Outlandish book,"The Real Truth About Alien Abductions is simply the most ridiculous book ever printed. I met Mr. Ness in a local libation establishment, and needless to say it is an experience I will never forget. He drew a picture for me and my comrades of an alien that had perpetrated him. He explained that the alien fed off of his aura and what a feast it must have been! I digress, this book personifies the author. Simply, it is crazy. His idea of government involvement with the aliens in a drug scandal is simply ridiculous and based on nothing but heresay. Also, the book appears to have been edited by a blind third grader.Thank you Mr. Ness, we are all less intelligent for having read your book and having met you in person."
1,Reading this book was worse than meeting the author...,"And meeting Mr. Ness was an awful experience. I realize the author is serious about what he's written and that makes is so much worse and more terrifying. The writing and editing are chaotic and the illustrations are funny in a scary way, mostly scary. Little bits of rehashed government/alien-abduction conspiracy, including anal probing, but with a new twist: Aliens are helping in the ""War on Drugs.""I DID NOT PAY FOR THIS BOOK! I met the author in a bar. He is, in my opinion, a mess. Shouting and spitting. After Mr. Vess drunkenly raved to my fiends and I about ""the truth"" and his book, the bartender forced a copy on us. Another patron had given the copy to the bartender and he couldn't wait to get rid of it.In all, it made me kind of sad."
5,Adventures In Time,"Yes, along with ""Cuban Fire"" an absolute masterpiece by Johnny Richards. Haunting, yet esoteric music for any Kenton fan.Each piece takes the listener on a trip through the Universe. Absolutely magnificent writing by a master of composition. The power and precision of each piece presents the listener with breathtaking time passages. First class solo work by Gabe Baltazar on alto, Don Menza on tenor, and Marvin Stamm on trumpet.As on the other Kenton ""Mellophonium albums"", these horns are once again showcased and their presence felt with power throughout the entire album.Absolute must for the fans of the Kenton ""mellophomium period""."
3,Decent But Unexceptional Session,"""Blind Man, Blind Man"" is a nice bluesy composition, and ""King Cobra"" is a decent bop tune. The album as a whole is less impressive than his first was, and not as impressive as the ones that followed, though there's nothing wrong with it per se."
2,"Too basic for Pilates folks, too advanced for beginners","I have done a lot of Pilates, and I found this session too basic (as have other reviewers). But I think this workout could be very problematic for beginners -- trainer Chaos includes some fairly advanced exercises without proper emphasis on form. In particular, the Teaser (which I think she calls the Vee-Up or something like that -- it's the one she's doing on the cover of the DVD) is an exercise that requires far more focus on form than she gives, if you want to complete the exercise without messing up your back. It is good that she offers alternatives for beginners (and, to be fair, she does offer an alternative for the Teaser), but I fear that there is a big gap between the beginner option and the main option on several of the exercises, and the lack of focus on form will make it easy for folks to hurt themselves."
4,Must have,"I bought this for my doberman. It is of good quality. I did notice the collar keeps loosening on it's own. I have to readjust it three to four times a day on my dog's neck. My dobbie does have a choke collar on her as well, which I use when taking her out. I would suggest, if you have to use this only for your dog, check it constantly before taking your dog out to make sure it is fitting correctly. If you go on long walks, check it while walking. If your dog is rowdy, not walking properly with you, then I do not suggest using this as a way to contain your pet. It may loosen too much and the dog might be able to bolt. I am a Steelers fan and had to have it for my big baby. I do not use the collar when walking my dog nor training her due to it constantly needing to be tighten."
1,Painfully bad,"Despite Bert Sugar's reputation, this is one of the most worst sports books I have read. He is guilty of ""overwriting"", inserting awkward metaphors and descriptives throughout each fact-starved page. I have tried several times to read this book, but each section is bloated with commentary such as ""...Aaron had quietly snuck up on Ruth's record...he was laying claim to more records than an Alaskan claim-jumper..."" Huh? And describing a young Bill Russell: ""...a skinny, six-foot-two, 128-pound teenager who looked like he worked in an olive factory dragging the pimientos through..."" What in the world are you talking about, Bert?This book is better when Sugar sticks to facts and doesn't try to dazzle us with his ""wit"". He is not a terrible writer, he just tries way too hard here. I wouldn't recommend this unless it were rewritten."
3,Not my cat's favorite,"This variety seems to be more shredded when you open the can - sorta like Shredded Wheat cereal in appearance. Because of that, I think it's getting stuck in my cat's teeth whenever he tries to eat it because he's always using his paw to try to get the food out of his teeth. He won't eat this anymore at all - he figures out what it is and that's it. It's a great idea, but it seems to fray and get stuck in his teeth. He gets a little aggravated over it so I took all of them back to the store."
1,It stank!,"Wow, that was a really bad movie. I can't really give a good review without spoiling the movie, but believe me, you won't like it. It was creepy for a moment or two, but that was it. I mean, come on, flying skeletal ghosts? Wooo....sccaaarrry...... OMG! What a piece of junk. I fast forwarded through most of the movie."
3,Worth a rental,"Could have been great, interesting story and very creepy atmosphere. But the movie was ruined by poor makeup effects and even worst CGI effects."
1,syfy channel crap,"I saw a trailer and read the thing about evil dead 4 on the cover and was a little hyped for it, and was a little disappointed that it didnt come out before halloween...well, the only thing like evil dead is the camera work. Theres no humor at all. The worst thing is definetely the cgi, particularly the skeletons. At most, its a rental, but I didnt even finish it."
1,Horrible,Don't fall for the comparison to Evil Dead on the box. This movie is crap from start to finish with ghosts that are about as scary as a Scooby Doo cartoon and a story with more holes than a bowl of Cheerios. I found myself fast fowarding through most of this to shorten the torture.
1,its only a movie????????????????.,this movie is not even close to be like the evildead movies well anyway they tried but sorry evildead is alot better then this movie .
4,Milwaukee 6310-20 18-Volt Ni-Cad 6-1/2-Inch Cordless Circular Saw,"Final got out to get some new 6.5"" blades. Works very good & not too heavy."
5,18 Volt Cordless Saw - perfect for the quick fixes,"This is my first purchase of a cordless circular saw. Because of that I can't say how this one matches up to other brands. The pros: medium sized therefore lighter weight than corded saws, lots of power - no problem cutting throught 2x4's or 1 inch oak, cordless - no connecting extension cords, it has a push button blade lock for easy blade replacement, safety trigger release - for those with kids, batteries seem to last about as long as my cordless Hatchet Sawzall (probably could crosscut about 50 -75 2x4's, and it will run on Milwaukee's 18 volt Regular or Lithium Ion batteries. The cons: blades (6.5 inch) can be take a little time to locate at some of the commericial big box do-it-yourself places (I know the big orange stores sell them) and it has a left sided blade - not a really big deal since it works very well right handed , it just takes a couple of practice cuts to know where the blade is cutting like all saws."
3,Nice but not the best.,Works best with Lithium Ion batteries. Will not run on m18 but v18 batteries so please don't confuse the two because they are completely different animals. The M is the newer type of L-Ion batteries from Milwaukee. The saw is nice and has decent power but does bog down or stop if pushed too much. I think maybe the 3200 RPM is a issue. Fact is a Bosch cordless saw is the highest at 3900 RPM and that saw does cut faster. The balance and control is one of the best out there for a cordless circular saw. The electric brake stops the blade very quickly when the trigger is released. The trigger takes a little getting used to as it has a safety on it that I would rather not have but all cordless saws seem to have safety's on the triggers. It will also work on the old type 18 volt rechargeable ni-cad batteries if you still have them and have not bought Lithium Ion replacements. Overall I like it for small jobs and it's actually the only circular saw I carry day to day in my truck.
3,good but this organization is not active or proactive,"the knowledge of the book is good. however, it is not feasible to say that all Indiginous black people are Lenabe/Lenape we are all indiginous but not all lenabe. This org take money but I never see there activity in the country."
