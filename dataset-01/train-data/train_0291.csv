3,Good start,"Decent book for a person wondering how to ""notice"" possible past life influences that are in your current existence. As with any good beginner book there are recommendations for further work."
3,Back to the Past...............,"How To Uncover Your Past Lives contains a lot of information regarding reincarnation as well as various excercises to help you discover who you were. It is not required that you know anything about reincarnation to understand this book. The author puts forth all the information you need in easy to read theories and examples. He even gives a word-for-word guide for self-hypnosis that you can tape record and use at home.I thought this book was a little too cheesy for my taste. Although I learned few things I did not know before, and it made me contemplate a few different questions, it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I guess if this is your first venture into reincarnation this book is a good one to start out with. But for those of you that have studied it, I would recommend skipping this one."
5,pure genius,What can I say....the man is a genius....sings through a telephone atttached to a motorcycle helmet for cryin' out loud!Great dirty f'ed up blues.....must him live for the full effect.
3,Trout Mask Dracula,"Capt. Beefheart fans can quit boo-hooing over their great white leader crapping out on music for trailer home paradise. Bobs has assumed the great musical mantle of Beefheart dementia. Quickly download the track ""Booby Trap #2"": it sounds like the Magic Band backing up Gary Glitter (BOOMPABOOMPA Hey! BOOMPABOOMPA Hey!) Great crazy slide guitar playing even the kids will enjoy. Never cared much for Doo Rag but this is dynamite. More vocals next time, Logman."
3,The story line was interesting but difficult to read.,"I enjoyed this book as far as the story line; however, I felt that I would have had to take medical and legal classes to understand a great deal of the jargon. I had to look up many words that I didn't have a clue what they were. Galvin's age didn't help my perception. I will try a another book of Barry's though, but should probably stick to Grisham, something I can understand."
3,"Versital, but flimsy","This wah actually sounds quite good, and the added flexibility of the three settings actually comes in handy for those who like to play a variety of styles. However, the unit is cheaply made- mine broke after only a few months of easy use. The plastic peices can be fixed, but these repairs won't last all that long. The other problem with this pedal is that it perceptibly diminishes your guitars tone when left in your loop- I would recommend disconnecting it when not in use."
5,Darkfever,"What can I say, except that this book is truely a pleasure to read. Looking forward to the next installment of delightful escapism."
1,Worst protagonist ever,"I usually love Moning's books and I picked this one up without knowing anything about it. Mac has to be the most annoying and boring protagonist in any book I've ever read. ""Vapid"" is too kind a word. I have no interest in her story; I made myself finish the book but the cliffhanger didn't make me interested in getting the next book at all. I'll wait and hope that Ms. Moning comes up with a more interesting heroine for her next series.The first-person POV didn't bother me but the writing itself didn't seem up to par with previous books."
5,Best Book I've Read in Awhile,"After a reading bonanza which ended with me feeling oddly depressed about the ever expanding urban fantasy genre, I found this. I was a bit hesitant considering that it was in the romance section but pleasantly surprised by the contents. It isn't much on romance though I suspect we'll be seeing some in following books but I found it to be good fun. Ignore the other reviews that says this book is anti-woman. I don't see it like that. Yes, some of the antagonist characters that are seeking the same mythical book as our heroine are anti-woman but then, that's why they're the bad guys. The main character is a bit shallow and appearance obsessed but then, how can we expect a character to grow if she starts off the book all grown up and strong willed? This is a fun, quick read with a nice little cliff hanger that made me go out and buy the next!"
3,"Good story, no text to speech","No test to speech. Publisher must hate vision impaired people.Otherwise, it's a fun story. The author does an excellent job ofbeing true to the mythology she has created."
2,Stockholm Syndrome much?,"DARKFEVER by Karen Marie Moning. (2.5 stars) Perhaps all the sensational, brilliant, stunningly jaw-dropping writing from other authors is making NYT Best Sellers look like child's-play? I don't know, but I'm not convinced this kind of mediocre writing is inspiring this many people to buy these books. The romance is so convoluted I don't see how anyone could have ""felt"" anything for the characters being together romantically. He's an ass, she's being held captive, love connection? Not buying it. Stockholm Syndrome much? No thanks!"
3,grown up scifi fan,"I'd suggest that this is a cross between buffy and the twilight series. Well written, but the teenage angst was just replaced with twenty something angst - not for every reader. Best enjoyed via used or borrowed books."
3,"Not captivating, although it has good moments","From the beginning you know this is not your typical fiction book, its about non-earthly creatures who apparently are here to destroy our world. While the plot is not well developed there are certainly points in the book that keep your attention. However, there is definitely a lot of ""fluff"" that caused me to lose attention and didn't excite me to keep reading. Overall I give it three stars as there are some great elements along with the mystery of what will happen as the series continues and how the characters will further develop. The main character certainly matures throughout the first book (given where she started that wasn't difficult) and hopefully we'll learn even more about the other characters she encounters during her adventure. I would read the next book, and if it is better I will continue to read the series."
2,Cheap Trick,"The book just ends as though it is in the middle of the story. I don't mean there is a cliffhanger it just ends. No idea still about her sister; did not find her sister's diary; don't know about adoption; etc., etc.. I was shocked and have really never seen this before. I won't be reading the next book in this series."
2,Not in the same league as Sookie Stackhouse,"I actually read this because another reviewer objected to the sex. (There are fairies that turn women into nymphomaniacs at least temporarily.) My problem with the book is that the female protagonist can't spot a clue until it bites her, not just on the ass but in a tender spot, and she is mildly incompetent. I like heroines who are at least fairly intelligent and resourceful. To me that is bottom line."
4,DARKFEVER TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY INTERESTING BOOK,"The main character is MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Mac is a sidhe-seer, which is someone who can see the true nature of the Fae and are not fooled by Fae glamour or magic, but she can be hurt by them. Her life changes when her sister, Alina, is murdered in Ireland. Mac goes to Ireland despite her parent's disapproval to find out what happened to Alina. Once Mac gets there her whole life is turned upside down again. Alina left a message for Mac telling her to find the Sinsar Dubh and that a man who she thought loved her was one of them and out to get her. The problem with this is that Alina didn't tell her how to find the Sinsar Dubh or her boyfriend's name. Now the action starts.DARKFEVER is a fast paced, well written book. I liked the storyline, I like the paranormal suspense, and the characters are well developed. This is book one in the FEVER series and I look forward to reading book two, this was a fun read."
4,Book is good - Potential is great,"This is a new style for me. Has good writing to keep you interested even when you hate ""Barbie"" characters. But I do hate it when someone thinks the nickname for Patrick is ""Patty"". It's NOT! It is ""Paddy"" based on the Irish spelling, not the English."
1,bored to death,"Probably the worst book I ever read. I would give negative stars if I could.I got this book through the Kindle deal. I am not a romance reader, I don't know the writer, never read her previous works. I don't think I will. Ever!The plot is boring, it is not leading to anywhere. The characters are weak.The heroine is a mindless town girl, whose biggest fear in the world is the discontinuing of a some stupid pink shade nail color. She is taking time to describe her clothes and hair (in her journal) even when she is chased by an evil fae.The author keeps describing her barbie like like matching pink outfits through the book. Half of the book is filled w/ outfit, hair and make up descriptions.I was glad when it was over.Even for the Kindle experimenting, keep away from this book, seriously. Buy a real book.It is an insult to your intelligence."
1,Frustrated,I love her books but I was very frustrated at how it left me feeling incomplete! Now to find out it will take 4 books to finish the story?Call me when it's done. Cliff hangers are not all they're cracked up to be!
2,Repetitive!,I would say not to waste your money and time and skip to book 4 & 5which are absolutely good plus they summaries the first 3 book . The series feels incomplete.
1,"Terribad narrator, good story.","wow whoever thought that this narrator could pass for 22 year old woman was out of his/her mind. I couldn't stand this audio book, I kept picturing a middle age woman acting like a total ditz. why couldn't they find a voice actress closer to Mac's age or young sounding, man way to ruined a good story.Don't waste your credit on this audio book, get the actual book instead."
2,Not a great read,I'm an avid reader and have read other books from Mrs. Moning and have liked them. This one however... I kept expecting it to get better but it never did. I have always finished each book that I have started until I got to this one. I couldn't make my self get to the end. Maybe it's just me but I just couldn't bring myself to like it even a little.
1,very disappointed,"I have read all of Karen Marie Moning Highlander books which I loved. I assumed I would love this one also. I was so wrong. I have never read a book like this its almost like watching a movie for 2 hours and at the end its ""to be continued""... If I didnt have to wait mths maybe even a year for the continuing story it wouldnt be so bad but the next one will be ""to be continued"" also:("
1,Very disappointing,I have loved all of her other books but this one was very disappointing. I wouldn't waste my money on it if I were to do it over.
1,a commercial rip-off,"I felt ripped-off after reading the last page of the book from her series where the author is hawking her web-site GIFT STORE to purchase t-shirts and coffee mugs. YEP the true colors shining through are greed. All this author wants is to split up what could have been ONE awesome book into 5 different parts so she can make more money.Yes, the first book in the series was free on kindle....but that's where they hook you in. At the end of the first book, I felt there should be SOME resolution and that the story should tell more about the characters. WRONG....it feels like each book is just a reincarnation of the same theme.First book was free, second book FIVE bucks, third book SIX plus bucks, and the fourth book was TEN bucks...minus a penny. The last book in the series doesn't come out until 2011. I feel utterly ripped off. I feel like I wasted my time and I wish I'd never read the first book. I'll never pay for another book from this author again."
2,Disappointing,I thought this story was very incomplete...I also did not like the 1st person voice. Not comparable to previous books. I won't buy a hardcover book from this author again. I'll also wait to read the viewpoints from other readers before I spend money.
2,"someone give the hero a better heroine, please",I don't get the cult following for this series. The heroine was TSTL most of the time and I can't see why Baron even liked her. I couldn't stand her. I won't be continuing the series.
2,Very Disappointing,"I confess that I read this book because I fell in love with The Highland Series. I knew this was going to be different because the author warned us. That said, the main character was so juvenile that I found her unbelievable and I had trouble finishing the book~~and I missed not having any romance in the story. I will read the next installment and if the storyline does not improve, I will not read another."
5,A must read series!,"My sister loaned me this book and said I would love it. However what she didn't tell me was it was a series!!! I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down! All the deadly immortals and secrets, not knowing who to trust! This writer throws you into a world where anything is possible including everything you thought was impossible! Non-stop action with twists and turns! I had to order the whole series the next day because I couldn't wait to find out what happened."
5,"Great Blend of romance, fantasy and suspense","I'm always weary of fantasy novels. Usually they are unbelievable or poorly written. I really loved this book. Mac Lane is a spoiled, shallow girl in need of having her eyes opened to the world. But her love for her sister is unmistakable and she is willing to brave danger to figure out who killed her sister. Really good character and plot development and the chemistry between Mac and Barrons is off the charts!"
2,Good world-building but slower than I like,"I loved the world-building in this novel and the premise is very intriguing, but it was so slow getting where it was going, and I still feel that nothing was really accomplished in the book.Intimacy rating: graphic and repeated depictions of sexual desire, several scenes of masturbation."
5,Beware of the addiction factor!!,"When I first bought this book it was only because it was one of the free books from kindle and it sat unread in said kindle for quite some time. I finally started it one day when I was at the gym and finished the book I was reading mid work out. At the start the lead character Mac seems really flat, but it quickly draws you in with the constant suspense and leaves you teeming with unanswered questions. If what you're looking for is a steamy hot romance this might not be your best choice but, if you are looking for a great suspenseful story rich with sexual tension this is an excellent choice. My only negative would be the cliff hanger ending but in the end that has only lead me to read the next two books in the series in record time and leave me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment."
2,Don't believe the hype.,The female character was beyond annoying and before I was half way through I had stop just to shut her down. Not worth the $7.99 Kindle price that I paid.
1,wow,"having read the whole series, she is just sick. Find out what's really going on in the end and it's just gross, sick, and creepy."
2,Boring,The most slowest book ever! Goodness! Something needed to happen and so I read and read and read and read some more going nowhere!! What the heck!!
1,Horrifyingly awful heroine,"I'm adding my one-star rating with the others just to counter all of the glowing reviews. I was baffled and disgusted by the inane heroine. I felt like my mind needed to be scrubbed and disinfected after reading this book - which I only finished because I kept thinking, ""no, it couldn't possible get worse"". If you took her out of the story it still wasn't difficult to miss the fact that in this fantasy it is clearly a man's world, and women are just there to serve, in any way, preferably in stilettos."
5,Everything I love in one book!,"Mackayla Lane goes to Ireland to find her sister's murderer. She ends up living in a bookstore with Jericho Barrons, helping him find a powerful book. To make matters worse, she confronted by a ""death-by-sex"" Fae, Vlane, who adds humiliation to her emotional ride abroad.I loved this book. It had everything: action, mystery, paranormal, and even a little bit of romance...a little bit....more like a hint of a possible romance. There were moments that had me laughing out loud. The contrast between Mac and Barrons made their relationship much more interesting to read. The bickering that went on between the two of them was hilarious. I just wish that the hint of romance would have turned into something more. Hopefully in the following books, their relationship will grow.The action was thrilling and suspenseful. I read the book in one day-I couldn't stop reading. I absolutely LOVED it."
3,Good Story,"I really liked the plot of this book, but I could only give it three stars because the main female character just a little too ""whiny""."
2,Definitely not a highlander type of story,"Gosh - so I go into this series thinking it is a continuation of the Highlander series (as I was told on the Amazon blog) and I disappointed. I read this first book, and nothing was resolved, I read the back of the second book and realized nothing was resolved then, I read the back of the 3rd book, and alas.....still nothing resolved. I agree with a very early review that this series shouldn't be read until the series is over. I equate this series of books to Lynn Kurland's recent series or maybe a push to put herself (Karen) in the avenue of Diana Gabladon.Regardless, it's highly unlikely I'll continue the series. I have the first 3 books and may or may not decide to read them."
3,Dark fantasy/romance with predictable romance,"I haven't read romance novels since I was a teenager, when my grandmother lent me a mystery collection that included the gothic romances of Victoria Holt. That said, I am guessing that the dark, dangerous, enigmatic man whom the heroine fears but who is really in love with her is a romance novel convention. Ditto for the occasionally explicit sexual reactions of the heroine. None of it kept me from enjoying the dark fantasy elements of the story, which is set in Dublin, a city I had visited just a few weeks before reading Darkfever. I finished the novel in a few sittings. It was pleasant entertainment of the cotton-candy variety."
1,This is the WORST series EVER,"This is well written, but an absolutely miserable series. I would sell mine, but I bought it for my Kindle. What a waste of money!"
2,Disappointed,"I read this book, but had to struggle through it. I agree with another reviewer - how dumb can a heroine be. Come on - no one is that clueless except in the movies. It makes one wonder what the author really thinks about women - obviously not much. The heroine is stupid, careless, and an idiot, and I don't believe anyone would really act the way she did. I was really disappointed in this latest book, and I don't think I'm going to read any more of the series."
5,Went out on a limb... didn't want to get down,"Like to keep your mental 'feet' on terra firma too? Let go, girls, and enjoy this ride. Moning crafted a gem with the first book of this series. She takes you brilliantly through the main character's disbelief in all things Fae so you're not going this journey alone. Mac is smart, sassy and endearingly human with mistakes and weaknesses and plenty of non-stellar moments... the kinship you sense to such a sister brings this magical story more alive so you can suspend that disbelief and inhale the intriguing plot Moning wafts around you! She will challenge your deepest thoughts on good and evil, how you define yourself between these polarities. What do you hear and what do you see? Upon which do you base your beliefs? Love the story, delve as deeply as you wish. Just join me up on the limb. It's worth the climb!"
4,Great read,I was looking for something different. No doubt I found it. So well written I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the rest of The Fever Series.
1,thank goodness it was a free Kindle book,"Unlike most who reviewed this book, I'd never heard of the author or her books before. Given the quality of this book, I sure ain't gonna read any more of them. Not one of the characters is likeable, especially the main character. Annoying! The stream-of-consciousness first-person writing is embarrassing to read, so cloying, and such an obvious attempt to create a cute but ditzy heroine. Like all of the free Kindle books, this book was meant to entice us into buying more from this author. No way!!!"
4,WOW!,"This is my first encounter with Ms. Moning's work and I was so amazed with her character development, plot and storyline that I' ve become an adoring fan overnight. Mac has a hard time deducing her friends from her enemies and learning to manage her abilities. Can't wait for book II!"
1,waste of money!,"I totally hated the main charactor- MacKayla....her arrogance was only superceded by her stupidity!!! She goes to a strange country, totally ignores warnings; is rude and so busy 'cracking wise' she invariably gets innocent people hurt and killed!! This could have been a good book if the writer were not so intent in trying to write like Laurell K. Hamilton! I read both the 1st and 2nd book (unfortunately I had purchased them at the same time) and they just left me more upset with the heroine than ever...I won't bother to read the 3rd book as frankly, I don't care what happens to her! I hope Barrons sees the light and lets her just die! what a waste of time! Oh and Mac ~ Barrons is a vampire for goodness sake, couldn't you figure that out already? Anyone want to buy my copies? $5.00 a piece! Still new with perfect dust covers!"
4,So Not Laurell K. Hamilton,"I've been trying to find a better author then Laurell K. Hamilton's fairy series. I have found it! Karen has created characters that I feel emotions to and none of them on this book have sex on every other page. She has a wonderful plot and characters with different views. This series has a mixture of mystery, fantasy, and a little bit of romance. I'm sure there will be more later in these books. If you adore later novels of Laurell K. Hamilton, you may not enjoy this book. The only bad thing I found about Darkfever is the fact that it's 1 of 5 books, I believe, and the ending to this book was very abrupt. I do plan on reading the next one and hope you find her as entertaing as I did."
1,Disappointing Deception,"I purchased this book because I have enjoyed reading this author. I was terribly disappointed in Darkfever. First it moved so slowly with little action and pages of boring exposition. It lacked romance and even the attempt at the beginnings of lust were flat. I found myself scanning the pages hoping for something better. When the book ended without resolving even one mystery, I was horrified. What a waste of my time. Also what a shameless ploy to sell books. If I want to know more I can by the next book which happens to be a more expensive hardcover. I can tell you I am not pre-ordering that volume. Also in reading the author's question and answer section I see that the story of Mac won't end in the next book. I have no problem with a continuing character. In fact I like it but each book must have some resolution or the buyer must be warned that this is only part one of a continuing story not book one of a continuing series. If I could I would be asking for my money back"
1,"""First Person"" disppointment","I love to get ""get lost"" in Karen Monings' stories. I was very disappointed in this latest book written in the first person which for me was boring and caused me to dislike Mac.....ALOT. Then there's the very misleading cover illustration considering there is nothing romantic here at all. The way it ended ticked me off ....making you want to run out and purchase the next in the series. The word ""greed"" POPS up boldly in my mind !!!! Hugely disappointedSheila Anne"
1,Mac,"A wonderful series of books and storytellers filled with fantasies.However, the lead character, Mac, is without doubt the most irritatingand insulting of any character in any fiction. The series would have been so much betterif this babbling whiner disappeared. I listened to all the books on audio CDs.If I could I would fast forward every time the reader opened her mouth.Just simply irritating....!!!!1"
2,Five Books before the Story Line Ends!!!!!,"I love Karen Marie Moning's writing and have read all her books. However, if a story line is going to continue with cliff hangers at the end of each of the books, there should be a warning in bold print on the front page about the ongoing story line!!! Five books before we receive the answers to questions asked in the first book is ridiculous!!! I have quit reading other authors who tried this tact to get their books sold. I hate to think I will have to give up Ms. Moning, but I will if this is how she plans to write in the future."
2,Sméagol?,"So I have actually been listening to this as a podcast, which I am entirely grateful for, because truthfully it's just not a story worth paying for. If you're interested, check it out at the library. Whatever you do don't buy the audiobook! The reader is the same in both the audiobook and the podcast, and while she does well coming across as a an empty headed teen girl, she sounds like Sméagol (from lord of the rings) when she's attempting male voices."
2,It was ok but not memorable.,"I found this book to be an ok read. I found Mac the main character to annoying and shallow, way to obsessed with her appearance. The detailed descriptions of Mac clothes and appearance were way over done. When I read a book I really don't care if a character's outfit matches her pink manicure and pedicure. Maybe in the next books the author won't be as descriptive. I don't find the main characters likable and the story dragged. But I did finish it."
5,Review,This is an excellent book series. Well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Characters are well written and it is very fast paced.
1,Disappointing,"I do not recommend on it's own. the story has potential but it never gets there, you never really know any of the characters, the plot is not strong and there is no ending!"
1,Don't waste your money on the hardcover...........,..if you must read this because of the who the author is then wait for a cheap used copy or for it to come out in paperback. I LOVE this author but this book was awful--for me anyway!!! The first person charactrer Mac annoyed me to no end and the story was in almost no way a romance. Half way into the book I stopped reading and just scanned to the end more so because I paid the money for it and not so much to see what happened. I don't usually leave reviews but I just had to let others know how bad this was!!!
2,Not for Everyone is an Understatement,"I'm actually kind of fascinated over how in the world any author could have found a character like ""Mac"" fascinating enough to write about. I was too annoyed with her to be fascinated. One more mention of a pastel color, or the word ""petunia,"" and I would have thrown up. Seriously.Jericho didn't fare any better in my estimation. Another extremely annoying character. I felt nothing for either of these people and don't wish to continue their story in the hope that I might someday understand why the author was fascinated with them.Sorry, Karen....love your other stuff...and this one could have been fascinating. Parts of it were interesting and had potential for me. I just hated your characters."
2,not recommended,"Can't recommend anyone start this series. Books are installments, not stand-alone stories and get more depressing and unsatisfactory as it drags out. Two male leads are domineering and abusive, if you're into that, rape theme runs thru first three books (so far) and heroine starts as a weak sort of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (minus campy humor and interesting friends) and gets darker and more pathetic. This book just kind of sets the scene without resolving anything, and isn't much fun. The 'ick' factor increases in subsequent books. Really disappointing for fans of this author."
2,Feeling used,"This book is clearly part of a multi-part story. It leaves you hanging - if you get to the end. It reads like Valley girl meets super stud but without any sex or pasion. If you are spendthrift enough to buy it, wait until a sequel comes out so at least you get more of the story. The author and publisher are clearly into ripping off readers with this one."
2,Disappointing,"Good book by good author. However, I was VERY disappointed to pay $17 (including S&H and tax) only to receive a book thinner than my average grocery list and to find that it's only an ""installment."" While I love the author, I won't be buying any other installments. This was a monumental rip-off."
3,Very DISAPPOINTED Romantic,"I am a huge Karen Marie Moning fan. I mean, I mark my calendars with her book release dates, just to be first in line when they come out. I buy her books in hardcover, because I can't wait on paperback release. But this latest book, Darkfever, has left me very disappointed. I was assuming this would be a romance. It was NOT. The story wasn't bad (I could have done without the first person point of view). But I am a romance novel collector and reader. Once I made it through 3/4 of the book, I finally had to accept that romance just wasn't happening. I was so let down, it felt as if a good friend had played a nasty trick on me. Again, the story seems to be a great paranormal mystery or thriller, I'll just have to pass on the remainder of the series(I must have my romance fix). I wish Ms. Moning the best of luck in her new genre."
4,"Great world, poor ""ending""","I picked this up when it was a free kindle download, figuring that despite the book's lineage (first non-romance from a romance (bodice ripper) author) that it didn't cost me anything, so nothing risked.I got pulled into the premise and the world despite my reservations. The writing's nothing that'll be referenced decades hence, but it's clear, it has a strong voice in the narrator/main character, and it's engaging. At the end of the day, what more do we really need from our fiction?The only down side to this is the ending that lacks only ""to be continued"" to be the book version of the season ending cliffhanger that the evening soaps used to have. The fact that the story isn't really contained, but sprawls across five books is a little irritating, but I'll still be picking up book two to see what else is really going on in this story's world."
4,Surprisingly good book,I am someone who is use to reading about vampires and weres. I never really thought about reading a series that is about Faes. This book was suggested to me and I decided to buy it just to try it out. After the first chapter I was hooked. The whole plot from beginning to end was just great. I think its mostly due to how KMM writes. She has a specific style that just pulls you in. This is definitely a book that I would recommend to others and this is definitely a series that I would want to continue reading.
5,Love it,"I'm not going to write a book review I'm only going to write what I thought of it. I read the entire series. Once I got started I didn't want to put it down. The story is a little out of the ordinary which is refreshing to find. Moning has a great imagination and her writing flows seamlessly. There are some sexual scenes in the later books but the story is not based on sex, that can sometimes become repetitious. Her characters are well developed, the story does not leave you hanging as long as plan on reading all five. I would recommend this to anyone that likes mystery and fantasy. I will probably read this again someday."
4,Great series,I read this first book and have been stuck on the series ever since. New and refreshing storyline. Nicely written. Really pulls you into the world Moning created.
3,Decent new series for me!,"I really like science fiction, but some of the longer more difficult books just don't hold my attention, and quite frankly I don't have time to commit to long tomes. So I really liked this small easy to read book. I read it on a day off and found it entertaining. I was a little annoyed that this book has no ending and requires you purchase the next book to get any resolution. I think that is a bit of a fail, and a touch lazy. . .but not enough so to turn me off completely from the series. The character has an ""Elle Woods"" feel, which could be annoying, but her concern for her family does redeem her a bit. Overall it is a fun and quick read with an interesting paranormal turn."
2,A feverishly bad read,"Moning always gets a lot of positive kudos on the Amazon forums, so when Darkfever was offered free on Kindle, I thought why not try one of her novels.Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be a good book to start reading Moning. I gather it is book one of a five book series. However, there wasn't much in this book that made me want to read the next four. The heroine seemed weak and at least for me not very likeable as she seems very immature. The hero on the other hand seems rather aggressive and too strong for the heroine. They don't seem to have much chemistry or much in common emotionally.The end of the book leads you to the next book in the series. I guess since this is my first Moning book, I would not recommend it for others reading this author for the first time. It might have been better to start with one of her better known Highlander books."
3,"Tea: Yes please, thanks","Overall, a solid first book to a new series.The story follows a young woman who travels across the world to find out what happened to her sister. She tries to retrace her sister's steps hoping it will lead her to clues somehow missed by the police. And soon she discovers that the lines of reality are blurred, as she's thrust into that new world of magic and mystery and strange creatures, completely unprepared. And in that new world, her only link, is a shifty stranger she's just met at a bookstore. But if she wants to truly know what happened to her sister, she'll have to jump head first into the magical world, and put her trust into a complete stranger.The story features characters from fae to vampires.Good story, intriguing characters. I liked the main character a lot, and the shifty stranger was pretty interesting as well."
1,Please tell me our heroine gets hacked into a million pieces soon....,I am still trying to get through this....I usually devour Ms. Moning's work in hours...it has been almost a week and I am dreading picking it up again. The heroine is laughable. I am rather disappointed. Mildly entertaining so far if you can stomach the juvenile ramblings of Mac. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will get better or that I will at lest have some closure and Mac is severed from this series forever.
2,Darkfever,"I was at first very excited to have an author that has a slightly different way of telling the romance such as timetravel included with paranormal. But just having recently purchased Darkfever,it was such a hugh disappointment. Beginning with the very first page the shallowness of the main character ie MAC, what follows is mainly death and destruction. Any romance at all? A few sexually sick Fae's, and a kiss between Mac and Jerrico three pages before the end. I will wait until I read all of the reviews after any new books from Karen Marie Moning."
2,No Doubt it's 2 stars,"This is the first book by this author that I have read. My first impression from reading the back is that this was going to be a great new series for me to pick up. Unfortunately I was wrong.I was annoyed that the main character never grew a back bone. This first book should have defined the character and where the characters personality was going. By the end of the book I was so sick of the main character I just stopped reading. I stopped caring about what happened to her sister or Barron. A person cannot go from small town, never had anything bad happen to them to big city half way across the world surrounded by death and not get over pink ice nail polish that match silver sandals. By the end of this book you should have started to see a person who is starting to mature and find their purpose.Ooh and I was tired of the word demarcation which seemed to be used every other page."
1,Tedious...Don't waste your money!,"Darkfever represents a departure from KMM's usual style in that it is in the first person. The heroine is chatty, informative and really, really boring. I get the impression that KMM was trying for something as cute as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and as edgy as Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, but the result is dreadful! To make matters worse, Nothing is resolved, the romantic ""sparks"" are almost non-existent, and this book is only a set up for the next one. I feel used.KMM is a hot writer. She has never failed me before. I buy her books, IN HARDCOVER, on sight, without even reading the description. I have recommended her to many people looking for a good read. But this was not even worth the paper it was printed on. I hope she returns to her ""formula"" soon. I miss it."
1,highlanderluver,As much as I love Karen Marie Moning this book really didn't do it for me. I could have bought another book and heard about this book from someone else. I feel as though I waisted my money on it. And now after reading this book I am scared to buy the next one because I might not like that one eiher. Normally her books make me want to stay up all night and all day because I can't put it down. But with Darkfever I couldn't wait until it was over..
5,Darkfever - - - Definitely worth the read!,"I LOVED IT! Man, the Prologue gets your attention, and the first chapter just sucks you right in. I stopped reading this only while driving or to sleep. I couldn't put the book down. I love reading Karen's books, and she is by far one of my favorite writers for Historical Romance books.MAC is this down to earth, totally her generation, type of girl. Life is bliss, no real cares in the world...the kind of kids we, of the previous generation (or generations), would like to knock on the head with something really hard, probably out of jealousy (tanning by a pool, living off the parents, not REALLY working or getting an education), and Yell --- Get A Life Barbie!Well MAC did. Now she's knee deep in it. I'm only sorry that I have to wait until October to read the next part of her life...and Barrons'. Looks to be quite interesting. I also hope some of the future 4 books engage some familiar people from the past that come to help out; particularly Druids."
5,A natural progress for the overall plot of her books,I bought this book with a lot of trepidation because I knew that this was not a romance and I was not sure I was going to like Karen's books without it.I was extremely happy to be proven wrong. I LOVED the book. The characters are human (or not) depending on who we are talking about. You find yourself so drawn into the story and worrying about the heroine and wondering how you could help her (with what WE know as the readers of the other Karen books). I found myself screaming at the herine not to do this or to do that. To me that is the mark of a great story and a great story teller. I can NOT wait for the next installment.
2,"If you don't know it's a series, it","I didn't know it was a series, so it was quite a shock to be left in the middle of everything...no answers to all the questions the book laid out. I was not a happy reader."
3,not her best,"No offense, but this book was not interesting at all. I started reading diligently for the first 70 pages, but then it started getting really boring. I skimmed through and found only a dumb blond (who becomes a sexaholic whenever that other fae thing shows up) running around with some guy name Jericho (which reminds me of a bad reality show). Yeah, they're searching for some book.great. But that's about all I got from it. It's not so much there's no romance because I do read genres other than romance, but it just doesn't give her books about the Fae (such as Adam Black) any justice. It's blah. But, I love Love love her other books because at least the ongoing story of abhoeal and the unseelie made sense. Now I'm all thrown off and confused. PLEASE STOP USING BLOND CHARACTERS ITS GETTING OLLLLLLLLLDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Extremely Boring,"While I was browsing around at the library, I noticed that this book had an, ahem, interesting cover and the summary seemed interesting too, so I decided to check it out. How glad I am that I just got it from the library and didn't buy it.Instead of being a romance like the cover suggested, this book is more like an adventure/mystery book. An extremely bad adventure/mystery book. It's about the heroine trying to find out who killed her sister, but I couldn't bother caring, as I found her completely boring. The book gets so wrapped up in its fae plot that I found it didn't develop her at all and left a big cliffhanger ending. Even worse, this book didn't even contain what I was looking for."
5,The beginning of a fantastic journey!,"I didn't know what to expect when I started Darkfever, it was something different for KMM and something different for myself. Wow, I'm so glad that I decided to read it because Darkfever is the first book in the most compelling and enthralling series I've ever read!I don't get the MacKayla hate, she's a 20something year old girl who prior to her sister dying didn't have a care in the world, I know people like her! It's great watching the evolution of MacKayla Lane in the hands of such a talented story teller.If you haven't read Darkfever yet now is the perfect time to start! All five books in the Fever series are out so there is no wait time between books. Turn off your phone, computer and tv and jump into KMM's Fever World. It will take you on an incredible ride!"
5,Liked it,"This book was very entertaining and creates a wonderful fae world within our world. I was surprised this was in the romance section, because though there are very sexually charged moments, this came off more as a mystery/supernatural novel about a girl looking for her sister's supernatural killer. That being said, I still enjoyed it and was turning the page to see what she was going to come across next."
2,Eh,"Someone recommended this to me, but it was just really slow. And considering how upset Mac was I thought it was odd that I couldn't feel any of her upset. I dont know. Maybe it was me. It seemed like it should have been a good story, but I just didnt connect."
3,IT'S O.K (HOPE IT GETS BETTER),"Well I got it just because everyone was talking about it, and I enjoyed it (I dare say)!I'm not head over heals with excitement but it was really captivating.Barrons has me wondering (allot of thing all the same time) what he is, what he is after....and so on.About Mac I can say that I loved her disbelief, another world opens up and she can't handle it at all!!! I'm really not fond of characters which take the entire nasty-tricky little vampire-faery-otherworldly thing too smoothly.Just hope that the romance heats up a little bit and thank god that this series is already over because I am not good at waiting."
3,Keep reading... the series gets better!,"To be honest I thought this book started out a little slow but the story was interesting enough that I kept reading. Books 1 and 2 in the Fever series do a lot of building up for the explosive action of the next 3 books. Definitely keep reading! by the time I was halfway through the 3rd I couldn't read fast enough and literally dove right into book 4 the second I finished reading the 3rd. Mac's whirlwind adventure is an adrenaline rush of danger, magic, and dark romance."
3,"Good ""Bones"" But a Little Too Light","I liked the Fae element of the book, & Jericho is an intriguing character. Ms. Moning seems to be a talented writer. (This is the 1st book of hers I've read.) However, having such a ditzy, below-average intelligence main character & then peppering the book with SAT/ACT-level vocabulary just made the whole thing just not quite work. I will likely give 1 more of the series a try, mainly because Jericho is such a compelling character. I hope Mac develops into a more believable character - fitted to her ""calling"" - as the series continues."
3,Not as good as her Highlander books,"Ok, first I really love her Highlander books but I knew from reviews not to expect anything like that with this one. This book was OK, I really wished she had not written it in 1st person but it was not a total let down. The different Unseelie creatures are interesting and I do love Barrons. For the most part I skimmed the book and focused on the times when Barrons was present. I'm hoping that the next book is better and I can't help but wish for a little sexual interaction between Barrons and Mac in the next one."
1,One more disapointed reader,"It seems that all of my authors in the ""got to buy immediately"" category have been failing me on their most recent efforts. KMM, unfortunately, has joined this ever growing list.The ""first person"" style doesn't bother me too much so I can't blame my criticism re Darkfever on this issue. This title could have been condensed to a couple of chapters prefacing this tangent to KMM's series. In reading Darkfever, I did something I would never have thought possible with a KMM book. I skimmed, skipped and eventually yawned my way to the end. How sad!This is, I believe, the third of my usual standby, favorite authors I have done this with."
1,A husband weighs in . . . . .,"I had never read a romance novel in my life until this past summer when we were on vacation and I'd forgotten to bring a book. My wife handed me her just finished copy of The Immortal Highlander and I was hooked. Though I didn't make it through the entire series, hard as it is to admit, I did go on to enjoy the adventures of Drustan, Daegus and Cian. Unfortunately, I can't recommend Darkfever. I was so bored and disinterested in the lead characters that even if they ever do evolve, I won't care. I don't plan to read anything else in the series."
1,Go Back to the Old Writings,"I hate ot say this, cause I love Moning's work, but the way she wrote this, well....I stopped reading after the first chapter. I tried continuing it, but by the second, I couldn't take it. The way main character talked drove me nuts! I missed the confident and sassy heroines. This almost seemed like she was trying just to get the interest of the new generation. Don't think I'll be continuing this series.Hopefully she'll go back to writing about Highlanders and time travel once she's finished this."
5,Great Series,I loved this book. This is a wonderful book full of great characters and a good plot. I have read all three books and can't wait for her fourth book. This book is very well written. I'm counting down the days until her next book come out in this series.
5,Glad I ignored the 2-stars...,"I usually make a habit of reading at least three bad reviews, and three good, and decide then if I should read the book or not.I'm really, REALLY, glad I bought and read this book. This whole series in fact.I'm not into spoilers, or quoting lines from the story, so I will leave it at this: It is more than a revenge story, and it's not at all a romance, although there are tons of situations and opportunities in which the write could have taken it in that direciton. It doesn't drop you into the middle of a fictional state of mankind, and doesn't broadside you so much that you feel there's too many details coming from too many angles. It starts out normal enough, and slowly (not too slowly) builds up and eases you into the world of Karen Marie Monings making. And that world is fabulous! Hair-raising and scary while simultaneously being humourus and attractive.I highly recommend this book, this series, to anyone. It's just a great escape =)"
4,pure entertainment,not usually a reader of this genre yet it involved me immediately and engrossed me entirely.
4,An intriguing beginning to an Urban Fantasy series,"I found the main character Mac to be a bit flouncy, but I suppose that's her charm. The writing is casual and by no means extraordinary, but what shines in this book is the plot. Moning has created a rich world with a mythology I can't wait to learn more about in the following volumes."
1,Appallingly Awful,"Let me first say that this book came highly recommended by a (former) friend. I usually enjoy paranormal tales. However, if I never read another word penned by this author, I do not feel my life will be the less for it. Indeed, I believe this novel could be inflicted upon people as a form of punishment. The narrator/""heroine"" is superficial , both in development and personality; if anyone can actually relate to her, I would immediately end that friendship based on their lack of substance. The plot is ridiculous and far-fetched, even by ""fantasy"" standards. If you actually enjoy reading books in this genre that are of quality, you will certainly wish to pass on this rubbish."
4,Enjoyable,Easy to read. Heroine isn't stuck in denial. She actually develops. It is a series book though. So know that you will have to read more to get what is going on.
4,Hot Amazing FEVER!!!,Don't let the 4 stars fool you...I am addicted to this series like a good drug. I feel powerless to stop reading it...really. (A book a night...but who's counting?) I would have never pegged myself to like an Urban Fantasy book much less a whole series. This book definitely is setting the bar high for the rest I might decide to try. Love the fast paced storyline with all of the characters shrouded in mystery. I'm on book 4 and I still cannot figure out the good from the bad. I leaves me wanting more...I will be ticked if book 5 does not have answers!
3,Not For Children,This book is not appropriate for children. The words are too big and fancy. This is almost 500 pages of descriptions of people getting their heads chopped off or way worse. It just goes chronologically through all the kings and queens and tells in detail all the people they killed and all the attempts on their lives.This author is pretty anti-Catholic. Joan of Arc was some poor unsuccessful misguided child who should have stayed home on the farm.I am giving it three stars because it totally reshaped my view of English history. It helped me to understand the sort of crimes committed by dictators in today's world. I am glad I have finished it and don't have to read any more of it.
3,Don't blame the dissapointment on the rating.,"I fully disagree with people that say this movie was not good because it was PG-13. Even the director used this excuse saying that the studio changed his movie. What bullsplit. Granted there may have been less blood (although it was pretty bloody for a PG-13 film), but the movie did not fail in that aspect. The movie was entertaining but failed in respects to actually pitting the Aliens vs Predator. There were too few fight scenese. The film turned out to be more focused on the human plight."
1,Why?,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. The story plodded along, dragging the audience with it, hoping for something, ANYTHING, more to like. The actors seemed more interested in picking up their paycheck, than working in this bomb. The whole point of science fiction films is to have some sort of science involved in the story, however my friend and I laughed out loud when the actors in Antarctica never had condensation billowing from dialogue. The story was so unbelievebly obvious and heartless, that I won't even bother describing it for anyone remotely interested in reading this. Save your money, buy the video game and play on line. Anderson shouldn't be allowed to make films anymore after this obtrusive, brainless drivel. Ridley Scott and John McTiernan should take legal action for this cinematic serial killing. Hare Kare (the ancient Japanese samurai suicide) was what I needed to get through that debacle. If I only had a sword at the theatre."
2,at best matinee fare,"I went to the movie with low expectations and they were met barely. The visuals were good and the fight scenes were excellent but overall, the humans are soo incredibly stupid. ""Gee what made that tunnel appear so we can get down to the pyramid"" ""lets not seperate"" and other brillant things that made me think of a typical teenage slasher film.SPOILERThe fight with the queen reminded me of aliens, could have been more original and the end scene with the dead predator belongs in every B-grade movie made and says hi Im coming back for a sequel all over it.I like Lance Hendrickson but he was wasted in this movie except for making a continuity sequence for the movies. The other actors were just cannon fodder and to show you how bad the aliens and predators were."
3,A lot of fun but still lacks the punch of the previous films,"I remeber going to see Alien Vs.Preadtor back in 2004 when I was stationed in Europe with some of my Air Force friends. Walking into the film I thought I'd get the same feeling I got the previous summer when I saw Freddy Vs.Jason, and while AvP does has some cool action sequences it could have been so much better. Sanna Lathan was good as always while the rest of the actors seemed as if they were there just for a pay check. As for the sequel well let's just say it's a slight improvement."
3,Better than expected,"Alien vs predator is worth seeing. Theres no point pretending its a classic film - its not. However to write it off completely is unfair as it has some merit. I thought the basic plot idea was a rather well thought out story, and for the first hour the film maintained a decent level of interest and even a little bit of characterisation.It was certainly nice to Lance Henriksen back playing Charles Bishop Weyland - a nod to Bishop the android in Aliens. Sanaa Lathan is also pretty good as Alexa (effectively the Ripley role) but you would have thought that they could have come up with something slightly more original than creating another Ripley like character. It did become a bit predictable in the second half of the film and there are some noteable plot holes that can't be explained away.Overall though I found to be an entertaining film. It may be shallow but there are a lot worse films than this out there."
2,Dumb,Writer/director Paul W. Anderson should stop making movies.His movies are so bad. I don't even want to talk about what he did with Resident Evil 2. The movie is so bad the people in the theater I was at actually booed toward the ending of the film. This movie does not deliver any scares at all from either creature. It doesn't stay true to all the movies in the series. Because of the pg-13 rating there is not much gore plain bad.The acting and dialogue is not good either. If you are a fan of the series you will be very dissapointed with this stinker. And then you will be thinking of what could have been if someone else made this film.
3,NOT SO GOOD...,"this ALIEN vs PREDATOR is ok...nothing brilliant, but a decent movie for the clash of the 2 coolest aliens of the galaxy...While Alien is some kind of alien parasite, brutal and without much thoughts, the Predator is a more humanoid form, with interstellar weapons and some war techniques...They are soooo cool! By far the best alien characters of all time!!!!"
2,AVP Movie Revew,"The movie is decent, but in the end I would call it a one time see movie. Still if you're a alien fan it's a good idea to have this movie in your collecton."
1,It was stupid stupid stupid!,I enjoyed Alien 1 and 2 but the others I didn't like. Alien vs. Predator did not make sense at all. The Predator being friendly to the lady at the end of the movie just didn't get to me. It was just too awful. The acting wasn't bad but the storyline was just out of place. The arcade game is way better than the movie. People who like this movie needs a life.
4,Just try it,"This movie is fun. If you're in the mood for a serious, mind-twisting thriller, skip it. But if you're in a mood that does not require much thought whilst enjoying a film, check it out.It was worth the $8...that is if you don't rip it apart. Just take it for what it is: Entertainment.It's really a fun 2 hours."
1,"If I could, I'd give it half a star","Can't we keep the playstation games on the playstations?What a ripoff! This movie is just to visualize those games!It has absolutely nothing to do with either of the other movies.When they brought frankenstein, the wolf man and dracula together, the did it in a more believable manner.I hope hollywood realized it didn't do justice to either character here.Boo. Hiss.At least Sigourney Weaver had the sense to not be in this one!"
1,an insult to two great franchises,"Paul Anderson has to be the worst director in a long time...I never got into the comic books, but I loved ""Aliens"" by James Cameron and the original ""Predator"" with A.S...the directing in Predator was brilliant because you never got to see exactly what was stalking these people until 40 minutes in the movie...anyway, the movie was geared toward the teeny-bopper crowd, which sucks....the script spends 15 minutes plucking a group out of nowhere with not much explanation and throw them in an ancient pyrimid (HA!) was rediculous. the funniest part in the movie was when the Predator helped out the surviving woman, and the best part can be seen on the trailer of the moviethis movie sucked...boycott Paul Anderson films!"
4,Alien vs. Predator,This was to be a Christmas gift and it arrived in time to be under the tree on Christmas morning!
2,worth seeing once...maybe,It just a let down that any one attempting to make these movies dont take it seriously and put little effort into them but it was worth watching once and it grows on you.
4,Alien v Predator v Humans (w/out sex),"Until Alien v Predator, the best human/alien interaction was Danny Glover's encounter with the alien/hunter in Predator 2. It was a down to Earth (no pun intended) face off between the hunter and the hunted. But humans are predatory by nature... we love the hunt, the kill, the challenge. The aliens never stood a chance.Alien v Predator now introduces the acid bleeding aliens we all got to know and love from that series of movies, faced against these safari specialists with humans thrown in as a bonus.Some one fire up that grill!It's the perfect set up... three races of creatures all pitting their ability to survive against the other.No surpises though... the bad guys lose, the middle guys get a trophy and the humans win... for now. Just don't leave it this way for too long though. We need another episode!"
3,"Good, but could have been better","It's a good movie, but the beginning is extremley boring and alot of the action looks fake. It does have good action in it (which takes up 2/4 of the film), but still, it's not very good."
1,AVP Unrated and still not a good movie.,"I managed to get my hands on a copy of AVP Unrated Director's Cut, and if you were expecting to see anything new that wasn't already on the original release, be ready to be let down.The only thing they did was edit in all the deleted scenes that were included on the original disc, and (badly) digitally animate more blood into every human death in the movie. It doesn't work at all. 20th Century Fox must be in desperate need of some extra cash off this stinker.So, trust me when I say this. The original release was better, if you even like the original. But don't give this one a second chance."
1,god this sucked,"Boy did this movie really suck...thanks fox and paul ws anderson for making a pg-13 piece of crap...and how does one alien kill two predators like it was nothing?? you would think two great franchises like alien and predator would at least get a decent director...and what was with that slow mow matrix like facehugger scene...???and was it me or did the predators look kinda fat and bloated? but the worst thing was when the predator took his mask off in front of the girl and he had this smile on his face! stan winston must have vomited...what did they do to the predators face? and did you notice when the queen came out of the ice the predator had this ""oh crap!"" look on his face...can anyone tell me how predator which was made 18 years ago looks so superior to this???"
1,AVP is very disappointing,"When I saw the AVP film in the movies, i thought it was lacking. It was too short and missing blood and gore. When i learned a ""director's Cut"" would be coming out, i was hoping they would return the origional scenes. I was very livid after viewing the ""new"" version. It had almost no new footage, the extra story line was not in it. What they did put in was not adding to the story. This is a terrible film."
2,Your kidding me,"I cant belive i listened to some Newspaper Reporters when they said Movie of the year. And i listened. I love movies where there is a monster and everyone is trapped trying to survive. Of course everyone dies but the main character, who didnt see that coming a mile away. Well it starts out these group of people saw a Pyrimid in Antarctica and they invistagation. It ends up there in a middle of a war between Preator and Alien. It had a preety good beganing and then it gayer as it went on. To the crapy actors and actresses to the cheap computer generations. It sucked. But who would thing it would be good anyway. I give it A 2 out of 5."
2,"Good concept, bad execution","This movie had alot of potential. I was expecting a very good movie, Alien vs the Predator, good concept (unlike Freddy vs Jason). first, it should have been rated R. since all the alien and predator movies are R, i dont know why this one isnt. The battle scenes were good, but the plot was just stupid. this is like Alien Resurection, very bad.what i did like were the fight scenes between the alien and the predator. but thats it. who ever thought the plot up should be fired."
1,Up there with the resident evil series,"This movie is painfully bad..When I 1st heard this was coming out I jumped for joy at the thought. I was thinking of classic aliens fighting the predator all while a bunch of colonial marines(the marines in aliens) where in the middle of the conflict..what turned out was this. Bascily a ripley wannabe is cought up in a war between the aliens and predators in a predator training temple. Which leads to alot of deaths from side characters and a pretty sad plot. In the end the predator teams up with the woman and they kill the queen together..this I think was one of the key things that destroyed this movie...what where they thinking of...Also..one alien manages to kill 2 predators by itself which is completely sad..It was just a run of the mill one, nothing special about em..If your a aliens or predator fan do not waste your money on this weither your buying it or renting this...they should be handing it out and paying you...its that bad."
1,Pretty weak,"You could take the greatest alien ever and the greatest predator ever, and match them up at some monster brawl to end all time, and it will always pale in comparison to Arnold and his buddies going deep into the jungle to save captured comrads. Somehow the whole genious behind either of these movies is totally lost in Alien Vs. Predator. But, who doesn't know that already. Predator remains my favorite movie ever and this thing was literally a waste of roughly 2 hours of my time."
3,What do you expect?,"AVP is entertaining, but also awful. It's the biggest guilty pleasure out there. What's next Chucky V. The Leprachaun?"
3,"A fun romp, but not up to usual A or P standards","What I did NOT like:1. The heroine was not strong enough to convince me she was what she was supposed to be. I did not believe for a minute that she had the skill to lead that group.2. There were too many stories going on in the beginning causing the viewer to be too distracted to get into what was happening.3. Not enough development in the middle of the movie, it just whams right into ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"" then ends.4. Sliced and diced apparently. When will the money-men stop trying to govern the art of film? This movie should have been full of the same fright and gore that made Aliens & Predator II so great.What I liked:1. The plot overall was a good one.2. The team members3. The scenery and special effects.4. Lance H. is always great to watch, died too soon.5. The archeologist was great, he died too soon though."
3,it's fun!,"I have read review after review trashing this movie. As a fan of the Predator movies, I can definitely agree that this is an inferior installment. It just doesn't have the intensity of the previous movies, and it isn't as engaging, nor are the characters engaging. The monsters just don't generate suspense in this movie as in the older ones. Also the story just failed to capitalize on all its potential. But its not it's the worst movie ever made, as some reviewers might lead you to believe. Yeah, its not as good as the the other movies in these franchises, but it is really a fun action flick. It has a neat story, some cool effects, and a great scary environment in the ancient pyramid. Of course the fight scenes are fun to watch. There are some really cool inovations, and subtle nods at the previous films. On the whole I would say this movie is very enjoyable, though it's not another classic."
3,An OK Popcorn movie.,"If you're going to see this movie, I highly recommend you have a bag of popcorn. Although the build-up is a bit long, I enjoyed the tension and the suspense (the popcorn helps the time go by). I was not disappointed with the final 30 minutes. There's lots of green fluids flying over the place. One thing I 'd had done differently is to have had more Predators and Aliens fighting. Initially only 3 Predators come to Earth to hunt the Aliens.Forget about the plot holes, if you want a good action-horror movie , AVP is it!"
3,So-so team up,"I was expecting more, I'll admit. A lot of this film didn't make sense and the history of the Aliens was played around a bit too much. Shortened gestation periods? Gregory turns in a top notch performance (as usual) as the Predator. Nice to see that CalArts education paying off for him."
3,"Do Not Be Fooled By The ""Unrated Director's Cut""","If you are considering buying the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" specifically for additional footage, then save your money. I already owned the original theatrical release DVD, saw the original in the theater, and am a Big Fan. So I purchased the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" without much research. After watching it last night, I can testify that any extra footage is almost transparent. A Big Fan will notice a couple of added scenes, but they are insignificant. There is no additional ""gore"" or essential background data.I have not perused the DVD extras yet, so this commentary is specifically limited to the ""extra footage"" in the ""Unrated Director's Cut"". In summary - it is a disappointment. If you already own the (very entertaining) theatrical release DVD, then keep it. If you don't already own it, then the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" is definitely a worthy purchase."
2,Not a Director's Cut,"I read an interview with director Paul W.S. Anderson several months ago where he discussed being forced at the eleventh hour to cut down the film to a teen friendly PG-13 rating. In the interview he mentioned that all the explicit kill shots were actually filmed and that there were several other sequences that he was forced to cut, including one where you see the Alien Queen being pumped full of steroids which helps the characters (and moviegoers) speculate that this was to speed up the Alien's life cycle. This would have explained a lot. The DVD box is marked UNRATED VERSION. There is no mention of the director being involved at all in this re-edit, which is essentially the EXACT SAME FILM, with a few extended dialogue sequences and some very insulting bad CGI blood added to the existing footage. How dumb does FOX think we are?"
1,a sad time for movies,when directors like paul anderson are given money to make crap like thise it makes me sad. i would not trust him to direct a porn movie when i see his name on enything i turn it off. the only reason his movies make money is coz his movies are basst on good franchises like resident evil there are a lot of fans of that game and will see the movie watch it then cry coz of how bad it is and its the same thing with alien VS predator and im not the only one that feels this wayps watch out for his next movie death race 3000 and pleas dont pay to see it
3,set in for a movie and got a hour and a half of adequite,"well just finished watch AVP and i have to say it left me wanting more, more dialog, more action, more overall movie (too short), less predators dying so fast, and the ending just leaves you hanging, nice set up for a sequel; but is a sequel ever going to be made? all in all i thought the movie was decent. was better than ok, but not pretty good, it was decent."
4,An honest non-nerd review!,"This is a non-nerd review for aliens vs. predator. I watched the film through rental and I was very impressed by the whole movie. It is very idiotic to pick apart every piece of a movie to determine inconsistencies among previous films involving the subject. I have seen all of the Aliens/Predator films and this movie exists along with them. In fact, I hope they make a sequel with an R-rating as to which would do the film real justice, hence me giving only 4 stars. It is a crime to make any horror related movie with a pg-13 rating. If you are remotely a fan of the aliens/predator series, check this out, you won't be dissapointed unless your a nerd and then you've got bigger problems to deal with."
4,good film but too short,"to put this in a nut shell with good and bad points:GOOD:-1)sets look great2)alien and predator fights are intense and fun to watch3)intresting mythology with regards to the predators4)great special effects and not too much cgi5)seeing a queen alien running around the north pole :)BAD:-1)only 90 minutes long(way too short)2)huge expectations3)sounds stupid but not enough gore(i wanna see guts flying!!)i may like this film more because i only have a little knowledge of the avp world(i have one video game) but i am fairly savey with the seperate franchises so i'm no outsider. people shouldn't expect this to be the next alien, aliens or predator because it's not and doesn't want to be, this is a seperate film. to put it in a nutshell i enjoyed this film but would wait for a directors cut if paul would ever do one and if your listening paul maybe you could do a box set with a bust of an alien or a predator... now that would be neat!"
2,The box office says it all!,"Look at it this way. AVP couldn`t even outgross Aliens, a movie that is 18 years old. Imagine the price of tickets back in 1986,and Aliens was R-rated! I REST MY CASE!"
5,point,people look at reviews to decide if they want the movie or not. they didnt ask for a history lesson. its hollywood get over it.
3,Three 1/2 Stars,"I've seen all the Alien movies, but none of the Predator movies. While I am not a huge fan of your basic slasher horror movie, I am a big fan of movie sci-fi like scary flicks like Pitch Black. I was pleasantly suprised with this one. Many of the reviews are quite negative, and I'm afraid I'm never quite in the mainstream. But as I don't go all out critical of movies, I usually just think if I found it entertaining and didn't consider it a waste of time, then I liked it. Funnily enough, I watched this with my mom and she enjoyed it too. I thorougly enjoyed the special effects and even if the mythology behind movie had holes, I didn't know any different or care. I really liked the direction the story moved in the last third or so of the movie because I thought it was a new and different way to go. I am really looking forward to the Director's Cut."
1,"Wow, this sucks.","I was expecting more from this movie, but I was greatly disappointed. The plot to this movie was lacking greatly. If ANYTHING, the plot from Alien V. Predator for SNES should have been used. At least it would truly be between Aliens and Predators. And no human intervention."
2,Sell out.,"If I had to sum up my sentiment for this film, it would have to be: ""it could have been so much better"".For starters, the characters are all cliched and instantly forgettable. Links to the previous films are extremely tenuous, and generally very lazy (in earlier films incubation of the alien inside humans took a day or two, here it only takes 5 minutes). This film should have been so much darker, more brutal, in line with the comic books. Instead they sold out rather, by trying to appeal to the masses.That said there is one redeeming feature of this film - the fight scenes between the alien and the predator. They are well executed, and genuinely exciting. Shame there is'nt more of them."
2,Big fan. Big let down.,The PG-13 rating says it all. You have two movie monsters who's main purpose is to kill but the only thing that gets killed is their true purpose. What we get with a rating like that is fast cut aways and the shaky cam.<br />The monsters looked cool but I cared very little about the characters. There was absolutely no suspense. There were a few cool action moments but it was less like what these monsters usually do and more like a wrestling match. The worst part of the whole movie was the corny human/predator team up (it was painful to watch)<br />The movie was by the numbers for a sci-fi movie targeted for the 12 year old (No offence 13 year olds but my requirements for movies at 13 weren't that high).<br />Rent this one if you must see it.<br />
2,OK but wheres the Marines???,"I kept thinking it would be like Predator, or Aliens where the military would do some thing about it, to stop the aliens from spreading, but aside from like 3 people with guns, this movie is almost a pacifist compared to its LEGENDARY ancestors. When people die, theres fighting right? No they just whine? IF the sequel doesnt have the marines in it, IM gonna have to burn down the theatres to stop this evil from spreading."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I don't understand why people are wasting so many words on this turkey. I'll make it simple. Besides, since AVP doesn't qualify as an actual movie, it doesn't deserve an actual review.You might like this movie if:1. You have never before seen a movie, and therefore have no basis for comparison.2. You are under the age of 11.3. You have never kissed a girl, regardless of your age.4. You are a HUGE fan of director Paul W.S. Anderson, and just absolutely love those kick-ass Resident Evil movies.5. You are Paul W.S. Anderson.6. You are legally blind.7. You own either Dragon Ball Z or Pokemon DVDs.8. You don't understand why everyone makes such a big deal over those Lord of the Rings movies. I mean, they SUCK!9. You care if Greedo or Han Solo shoot first.10. You read the byline, and actually want the Aliens and Predators to win, so you can lose."
1,"Good Lord, How Did This Get Made?????","People are actually giving this piece of garbage 5 stars???? Are they insane? They must be connected to the film in some way, because this film was terrible! Acting was weak, secondary characters you could care less about, action was very minor, and the ending? Please! An infected dead Predator with an alien baby inside. Come on, how many times has something this weak surfaced, only to kill off a good premise? This movie had potential, but fell flat on it's face. Yes, the film had a few good spots, but the keyword there is ""few"". I found myself yawning throughout and noticied people laughing and shaking their heads.Save yourself $9 and wait until video, which should be alittle better with the director adding more to it, hopefully more character development."
2,Please release a director's cut DVD,"Dear Paul W.S. Anderson,Please invest a little time and effort in a director's cut DVD of AVP. I bet there are miles of good footage on the cutting room floor.Thanks,A disappointed AVP Viewer"
3,worth watching for the ending,"Chronologically, it predates all the Aliens movies, the setting is 2004. Typical military sci-fi, you don't need a review to tell you what happens to the cast, one by one. And if you're already familiar with the Predator movies, you'll be screaming at the TV, ""DON'T TOUCH THE GUN!""Did I mention the ending is pdf - pretty darn funny? As Jayne from 'Firefly' would say, ""High-Larious""."
3,Not as bad as the reviewer's would make you think,"I enjoyed both entities. As with the excellent Alien series the sequels should have stopped at 3 but money talks. But, combining the two ""hot"" aliens makes for some ok movies. This is not fab but it's not horrible. I thought it was pretty good.Enjoy!"
3,Had the same problems as The Hulk /both REWORK CANDITATES,most of the scenes were so dark it was difficult to see what was happening in the film even with the lights off. A good movie with bad lighting.
3,Two franchises come to life...sort of.,"I went to the theater to see this film. Everyone there (including me) was praying for the ALIENS thrill ride we got back in 1986. That didn't happen. However, I thought Paul Anderson did a good job of combining two separate franchises in an engaging story with incredible special effects. To tell the truth, I am not a huge fan of Predator and would have liked to have seen what Paul could have done with ALIEN 5. I'll admit, I wasn't thrilled with certain aspects of the plot, but I think Paul remained true to the original creatures. I also thought the set design was brilliant. One more thing...this movie should have been able to get an ""R"" rating like every other Alien film and should have been 15 minutes longer."
5,AVP Roxxx!!,"I turned on this BluRay and my head exploded it was so awesome. Then I showed my roommate and he threw up all over the TV and then jumped off the balcony cause he couldn't take it. Then I showed my friend and he vaporized right in front of eyes. This movie is so sweet you probably shouldn't even watch it, because you like watching movies like Little Women and Can't Hardly Wait."
1,Nice sets and that's it,"Wow. A plot that ranks right up there with some of the worst in the history of movies. Wooden, leaden acting by about 3/4 of the cast. Some of the photography is decent. If you have no interest in plots or acting but have a thing for science fiction then you might be able to get a sliver of enjoyment from this but I can't imagine that most will enjoy it at all or even make it to the end. I almost feel like I deserve some kind of medal for watching the whole thing.Regardless as to who did what in the war of the Director vs Producers, the plot has no legs and the writers should be banned from working in film again. At least then we could say that some good came of this movie."
1,"Oh my God, Why Sr.Anderson,","Okay the frist of residen evil is ver bad, but this is a joke or what,the only good terror movie of the 2004 is Dawn of the DEad and Saw, i don't wheret why the movie is not nominade for the worst movie of 2004, if you want a really good movie buy a movi like Dawn of the Dead and you have fun(if you are a fan of the terror movies)"
3,ONE HUGE FLAW FOR MAN KIND,"Even though I liked this movie and it was entertaining to me, the thing that really pulled this movie down was the simple fact that it became a typical movie where only the main character survived. There is no...soul in the movie. Its just a bunch of people stepping inside this pyramid and running around screaming and finally dying. Several people that I really hoped would survive died in pathatic ways, characters that could have made the movie a lot better than it was died with little plots intied to them.However, it still entertained me and I just LOVEEEEE seeing the alien queen, she is soooo cool. Best in this trilogy is ALIENS...part 2 of it. Its Alien, Aliens, than Alien 3. The second one is best.GOD D.A.M.N the makers for f.cking up something like this. This movie had soooo much potential. Very disappointed."
1,This is Garbage.. Save Your Money,"This is biggest waste of franchise I have ever seen. Unfortunately i realized this 10 mins into the movie and having looked at my ticket stub where it read ""Rated PG-13"". The preceding movies have been known for showing violence and gore and this was dissappointing. I aint saing a nonviolent movie cant be good. The movie itself was bad with unlikeable characters, not enough action between alien and predator and a shameless setup for another lame sequel. I wish i did not spend the 10 dollars at the movies and saved it towards the alien boxset or the predator s.e. dvd."
2,NOBODY SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS MOVIE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!,"AVP WAS VERY DISGUSTING AT PARTS,AND THE WORST PART WAS ONLY THE GIRL SURVIVED!AND THE GOOD GUY AND THE BAD GUY TEAM UP TO DEFEAT THE ALIEN! AND DID ANYBODY NOTICE THAT IT HAD A SORT OF CHEESY PLOT,AND THE BACKGROUND , AND THE WAY THE ALIENS WERE MADE AND/OR THE COSTUME?I DID NOTICE ALL WAS CHEESY.I ALSO WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS FOR LITTLE KIDDIES,PARENTS. I RATED IT TWO STARS BECAUSE I FELT SORRY FOR IT. IF YOU LIKE ALIENS AND ALL THAT JUNK,JUST RENT IT,PLEASE YOUR $20 IS NOT WORTH IT."
4,cool,"this was one of the coolest video game movie ive ever seen. which has stunning visuals, and sanaa lathan rocks."
3,AVP Aliens Versus Predator,Good package a little short on the extras but they still expanded the story. Good buy for any fan
4,"Not Bad, not bad at all!","I saw this movie twice, I liked most of what I saw, there were somethings that I did not like in Alien vs. Predator, one of them being how the quickly and how the first 2 predators were killed in this movie, and the second is how cheazy looking the predators shoulder cannons looked. Other than that the movies was spectacular, strange but still a good movie regardless. I have been a fan of both the Aliens and Predator franchises since I was 10 and I have to say that this alien vs. predator movie has been long overdue."
3,Its ok,AVP was a ok movie. I was going to see The Borne Suprmecy but was 15 minutes late and couldnt see it so I saw AVP instead. The beging was boring. The middle was ok. There was a lot of action. And the ending was just stupid. In the end the pedator gets hurt and a person is looking at it like they love it. I thought it was a corny ending. Pretator was a lot betterthan this. When it comes out on DVD and video rent it If you liked Predator or Alien rent it before you buy it. The whole movie is about a temple thing under ground that has aliens and peditors having a war in it. Some people find it and go on a expedition to it and the expedition goes wrong beacouse of the aliens and predators. The people on the expedition gets split up and everyone dies exept one person. Rent it.
1,Whoever wins ... *WE* lose,"As long as *we* is construed as referring to the hapless cinema-going public, then you have to give the promoters of this witless film credit for at least being honest.For the huge problem this film has (leaving aside small matters such as a lousy script, complete lack of originality etc.) is precisely the point that the tag line - wrongly - addresses: No matter who wins, we (the human race, that is) WIN. For surely it would be better to have just one set of genocidal bad guys roaming the antarctic wastes, and not two.As they're slugging away at each other *we* just don't care a jot who wins. As is evidenced by the box office returns on this turkey.Olly Buxton"
1,"So, looks like Paul W.S. Anderson lied to everyone?","When this came out in cinemas, he claimed that it was cut 3 weeks before release and all the plotholes were caused by the edits... despite people who saw the script claiming that was a lie.""Wait for the DVD"" he said, promising all would be reinstated. ""You can't reinstate what doesn't exist"" said some.So, here's the DVD... looks like the same content and rating as the cinematic release. Well done, you ballsed up a potentially decent film."
1,Don't bother,"This movie was absolute trash and shames the whole Alien and Predator series. Good special effects (thanks to large budget) but rest of movie (acting, story, etc,) way too corny and bad. I'm just relieved I didn't pay to see it (thank you Predator special edition DVD). Do yourself a favor and watch any of the other Predator and Alien movies (even the awful Alien Resurrection)you will be 10 times more entertained than watching this crud.BTW they ruined the predator's whole image by making it ""friendly"". What the hell! The predator slaughters every human it comes into contact with and then suddenly is friends with the remaining human survivor. What a joke, just like this entire movie."
4,avp review,Hey guys its me agian and i want to review this awsome movie. the movie takes place in the year 2005. A team of explores are Assembled to find a pyramid hidden in the north pole the movie starts off kinda like one of those documentaries about the wild but ramps up when the humanswake the alien queen. this one is rated pg-13 the strange thing is theres not really any blood but they say the f-word twice the film is pretty cool i recommend this to any one who wants a awsome action movie alright guys im out.
3,Pretty good,"Ill keep this short. Its a pretty good movie,kind of cheesy at some points but gets right into the action and that is really all that matters in a movie called ""Alien Vs.Predator""You cant really expect a really awesome plot and this movie doesnt give you that, but what it does give you is a decent story and some pretty cool fight scenes between the alien and predator.This movie also did really good in theaters and only has somewhat of a bad rep because it didnt live up to AvP fanboy expectations.a couple of reviews ago someone had mentioned that the movie bombed and the directors cut was ""only released to feed the cast and crews family"" but the fact is the movie did not bomb and it is not by any means a horrible movie.i mean come on do dome research before you start poppin of you mouth pretending you know things. Bottom line its a good movie not incredible but good and if your a fan of the alien or predator series pick it up."
5,Looked great on my Samsung BD-P1000!,"I played this on a Samsung BD-P1000 and the picture quality was great! The sound was also very clear. It's a fun movie and I really enjoyed the experience.I had to upgrade my firmware before playing it, so make sure you do that if you have any problems watching it."
4,Much Better than Theatrical release,Now don't get me wrong they only addes some bits here and there but it changed the tone and motives of some of the characters and the mood. I feel what was cut was purely to get a pg-13 rating nothing else. Some people criticize this film as being boring or out of touch with the others but this is a Pre-quel in a sense and it works very well fast paced and more graphic in the new edition see it.
4,Great great monie.....,"If you are a fan of any Alien movie or any predator movie, this is a must see. Forget about what ever one else is writing here, the plot is great, and the action is awsome!"
3,AVP,"A friend loaned me ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (recommended) in the full-screen version - usually not recommended, but in this case it probably didn't matter. There wasn't that much interesting happening in the middle of the screen, so I probably wasn't missing much happening on the edges.I'm not a devoted fan of either the Alien or the Predator franchise, and I suppose my ignorance has inoculated me against outrage. I don't know alien incubation times, or when a predator has last visited the earth, and I don't remember what a predator is supposed to look like when he pulls his mask off. Also, I'm blissfully unaware that AVP offends the story lines of earlier movies.AVP is okay, but that's about it. About my only beef is that the aliens didn't really versus the predators enough. Probably a rental, but I'd recommend borrowing it from somebody if you can."
3,Mindless yet Somehow Entertaining,"In spite of its manifold flaws, AvP managed to be fairly entertaining. The characters were all pretty flat, the acting was horrible, and all but one of the humans dies without putting up any kind of meaningful fight whatsoever. The premise is totally absurd. The movie is basically entirely lacking in subtlety or depth. But for all that, I have to admit to having taken a great deal of rather juvenile satisfaction in watching the Predators and the Aliens-- two of the baddest beasts ever to hit the silver screen-- tear each other to shreds. Plus, once the main human character hooks up with the Predator to help him do battle, she turns out to be pretty cool, too. This is definitely about as mindless as action flicks come. But if you're male and under thirty, you'll probably get a kick out of it anyway."
2,Awesome speical effects,"The movie is PG-13 so that pretty much tells you what you wont see. The speical effects are really good but as I said, PG-13 really hurts the movie. I see they have an unrated version but I wont buy it. I did notice that they have an extended version. I thought it was cool until I realize it didnt have more violence, just swearing. Cool effects with a few scenes that are really good but overall, disappointing."
4,"Awesome action, dull,confusing & ridiculous storyline","Many people might get offended if i give this movie 4 stars( SPARE ME !!!! Some have also given it 5 star). ONe major point everyone agrees that the story is distorted and twisted, even the entire history of human race has to be rewritten to fit this story.The backdrop of this story looks as if a 10 year old has written this screenplay out of his childish imagination.Even the storyline in the movie is pretty weak . All human characters die except one and humans are not at all involved in any fight sequences( They are just mute spectators). I had the feeling that its story could have been better.Although acknowledging all this,This is a great action movie.The action stills,the breathtaking images,the larger than life fight sequences all add to the eeriness of the movie.IF you will see this movie in a theatre you will definitely be blown by it.All in all,an excellent fun and entertaining movie."
2,um...well not so good,"With a plot that makes absolutly no sense if you've seen any of the alien or predator movies and a bunch of faux scares with decent effects but no real gore (which is what you look for in one of these films) AvP falls short, very very short of what it could have been. The acting is what it could be which is not very good and the alien on predator battles and or fights are really dissapointing. This is no war. It's one predator and a human girl fighting a bunch of aliens. False advertising is what I call that. A waste of time and money, not just for the consumer but for 20th centery fox as well...really bad."
2,The Human Element,"ALIEN VS. PREDATOR has an interesting idea and some cool special effects...but they shouldn't have been so quick to kill off all the human characters. The scruffy space crew of ALIEN and the steroid mercs of PREDATOR helped make those films the classics that they are.First blown opportunity: when the commando tumbles down the ice shaft, he lands covered in ice and snow--reminding me of Arnold covered in mud in the first PREDATOR and concealing him. So why couldn't the commando have survived to keep some human element in the story? Why couldn't the Predators have missed him like they did Arnold?Instead, the people are dispatched with little imagination. And the movie suffers. Or, I guess I should say, the audience suffers."
5,Buy this DVD NOW,Both Predator movies are great and I love Alien and Aliens but the Alien films took a sharp turn into the Trash can with Alien 3 and 4. This Film renewed my faith that a good Alien film could be made. I will buy the Director's cut and look forward to AVP 2.
4,"Won't win any awards, but still good.","I have two reasons for giving the movie four stars instead of five.1. The human characters are cliche and you just can't get to the point where you really care about them.2. They messed with the Aliens life cycle a tad. In the original movie, it took a few hours from the time the facehugger attaches to someones face till the time they wake up, give another couple hours before the chestburster actually emerges. Here, the whole process it greatly condensed.But who cares? Most people going to see this movie don't really care about the humans. I doubt they'd care too terribly much about life cycle continuity. They want to see the Aliens and the Predators fighting it out to the end. And in that category, this film delivers quite nicely. The Aliens have never looked better. While the gore is toned down a tad for PG-13 (chest bursting in particular is more implied than shown), it doesn't get toned down in action in the least. It's definetly worth the ticket."
5,AVP,"Why buy new ..The DVD was just like new no scratches, played like new one..movie and sound ismuch better in bluray then regular DVD"
3,Good but not great,I would have preferred the unrated version but Amazon video does not have it. It also would have been nice to have some special features included.
1,Do these guys ever actually watch the originals?,"Between this movie and Resurrection I've pretty much given up on the idea that directors now could achieve continuity and/or quality in a story continuation. The first 3 succeeded because of a style. The stories were about the struggle and unity of the few survivors, not about how cool it looks to see someone killed. This movie (like all of Paul W.S. Andersons) could have easily been written and directed by a grade schooler.He cares more about facehugger bullet-time shots than actual suspense, a point that is made even more apparent if you watch any of his Resident Evil movies. And if you swing an alien around and smash it into a stone collumn I really doubt it will just plow through the collumn with very little physical damage.[...]"
3,Not really any better.,"I concur with another reviewer that stated not much more was put into this edition. Rent it and make up your own mind beforewasting the money if you already have the original version. If you don't the buy this one. Kind of a waste of money for thoseof us who bought the origanal, then bought this anyway, but I traded my old one in and got some decent cash to put towards this one so no harm. But again, if you already have the origanal, don't waste your money."
2,"Good Music, Cool Predator, Great Set",That says it all for me. I liked that the people had to side with one or the other and some of the action and the design was really great but when i was finished watching i deffinitly didn't need to see it again. I have seen Alien at least ten times and Predator at least four. But put them together and it's almost a bore.
4,AVP dvd,"I picked this up for my friend who just HAS TO HAVE this movie. Came very fast, like 3-4 days . Sealed , perfect. good price. Thanks"
2,What a pity!,"I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5. In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films. The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series. It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it. I think they could pull off one more film. Ripley's a great hero.This movie was pretty bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects. I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien. Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money. The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent. Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement. This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair."
1,Worse Then Garbage,"Whe I first heard Alien Vs. Predator was happening I was excitied, I went to see I fell a sleep after the first 40 minutes. I rented it once and almost took it back three minutes after I finished it. This was the awful!!, Their is alien gore which sucks that's it, no good actors, I can't even name one that starred in that movie, the looks and effects were sh*t. The ending had to be the worst of all that. I'm just glad I didn't buy cuz if I had that movie would be burning in the fireplace right now. They had to take good movies and fu*k them up with this sh*t. Worst of all they gave this movie a PG-13 so all the good things about a horror movie were gone. If you wanna see to good horror icons go at it, watch Freddy Vs. Jason that movie at least kept me intertained."
3,The Hype It Isn't.,"ALIEN VS. PREDATOR was pretty much exactly what I thought it would be. The movie could have been a lot better, but it could have been a lot worse, too. The movie kind of explains part of the history between the two different races, but doesn't go into much detail. The movie takes a while to get going and because the people in the movie are killed rather quickly, it doesn't leave much room for suspense.One thing I am curious about from the film. Lance Henriksen play Charles Bishop Weyland, a man who is the father of modern robotics and likes to dabble in archeology. In ALIENS, Henriksen portrayed the android Bishop who was responsible for saving Ripley's life. I don't think the connection is a fluke: did Weyland create Bishop? I don't know, but it's kind of fun to think about.Overall, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR is a decent movie and average sci-fi flick. Perhaps it will make more sense in the future once more of these films are made (and they will be)."
2,Mangled Menaces,"I really am not at all very impressed with too many movies these days, because there really isn't anything all that exciting right now. Anyway, th latest Alien Vs. Predator, isn't all as impressive beyond the original Alien film. Although Sanna Lathan has done some spectaular performances in A Raisin In The Sun, and in Dissaperaing Acts with Westley Snipes for HBO, this film is just a first class bomb. I really wasn't very impressed with the story and the detail of this movie. It just really seemed like the same thing a lifetime ago. All in all, for die hard Sci-Fi fanatics, it is a good film. Otherwise, don't bother seeing this flick."
3,Reminded me of Jurassic Park 3,"I found the movie to be short, sweet mindless fun...A satisfying popcorn movie. See it with no expectations, turn off your brain and you won't be disappointed. A pleasant surprise."
1,Looking for a Comedy? You found the right one!,"If you came to this movie looking for something up to par with Aliens or Predators? Then turn your back on it now. From the cheesy plot, predictable story and average to undestinct acting the most this movie has to offer is a good laugh.The start is basic of an action movie and you might be a little intrigued but as the aliens start showing up and then the predators any suspence or interest is gone. This isn't an action its a comedy, half the time the alien and predator don't look like their going to fight; they look like their gonna kiss! And when your heroine seems to be developing a bit of a crush on the predator? Well, I just hope they ment this as a spoof and not a serious attempt to follow up the former movies."
4,Predator Alien meets Indiana Jones,"Unlike a few other's I wasn't disappointed in this film, it was enjoyable enough for this kind of genre. No its not on the same terms as Alien but then what is. If you have seen Alien and Predator and you're looking for something a bit different which ties those two worlds plus adds a dab of Indiana Jones then break out the popcorn."
2,Eh...,"I didn't really like this movie at all. On paper, the idea is great, they just failed to pull it off. I really wanted to like it, since I liked the first two Alien movies and the first Predator movie, but I just couldn't. I didn't feel any suspense at all throughout the whole film, I didn't care about any of the characters save for maybe one, and the plot was kinda confusing. I wouldn't recommend it... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Ok to watch on a boring night...,It was fairly good. There have been better movies though. It was not too scary. It wasn't scary enpugh to keep me up at night. Best to rent not to buy!
3,"Overall , pretty good","I wish it had more graphic scenes of death and gore, but it's not a bad flick. The predators looked pretty cool in it and I liked the aliens. I'd say worth owning, and here would be the order in Alien series: Alien(A+), Aliens(B+), Aliens Resurrection(B-), AVP(C+), Alien 3(D-). The predator series: Predator(A), Predator 2(C+), AVP(C+)"
4,Director Paul Anderson redeems himself..,"IF this is not a godd action movie, I don't know what it is. The pace is intense, the special effects are not used to cover a bad script, the battles sequences are exciting, the scenarios are gorgeous (I'm talking abou tht eunderground pyramid), the jokes are enjoyable, the cannon-fodder cast do their part with ability.It was MUCH better than Jason x Freddy, and it had a little bit of enthusiasm and care for a commercial project of this kind, which usually are mechanical and lifeless."
5,AVP Rocks,"Ok Ebert and Ropers chill, there are many movie critics out there bashin AVP. If you haven't seen this film yet, then your missin out on a cool flick. For a PG13 movie it has alot of gore in it, even if it is green and slimmy. Plenty of action seens here too. Who cares what people say about this movie cause it rocks, Im writin this review to hopefuly raise its customer rating. Check this one out, this movie is one of my fav's. And Ill be sure to check out the directors cut of the film when that gets released some time in the future. Ok, quit reading this and watch this movie loser."
1,Popular at Wal-Mart...,"What sound do you hear at Wal-Mart's more than any other sound? Okay, besides the yelling and screaming of people who feel as though being obnoxious makes them more impressive...Cash registers!The only reason this movie was made was to make money flow forth from you to the studio, nothing more. They are trying to get you to waste money on a film like this that's so mundane, so hopelessly ridiculous in concept, that it makes new Star Wars look like Oscar material.So get ready for AVP: whoever wins, we lose. Big bad monsters! Cool special effects! Lots of killing and action! The action event of the year!Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
5,"NOT an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" Movie...IT'S AVP - Got it!!!!!","The fact that Lance Henriksen (a.k.a. ""Ash"" (Alien) and ""Bishop"" (Aliens)) is in this movie, and he's not a robot, should tell one that this IS NOT a sequel to the Alien or Predator family line......it's a NEW movie. All these ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" fanatics have come out of the woodwork talkin' about how LONG they've waited for the ""sequel"" (huh?) and it doesn't live-up to their expectation. I loved this movie! If you're looking for a great sci-fi movie with a lot of action, incredible sets, great imagination, and yes - GREAT acting - then this movie beats all of them! You get a HUGE dose of Mr. Predator and Mr. Alien with little humans stuck in-between. I bought this yesterday after being impressed in the theaters and IT DID NOT fail to live up to what I thought about it in the theater. SO, if you're going into this looking for a sequeal to ""A"" or ""P"" you're not going to see it clearly. Out."
3,it was ok,"how could one alien kill two predators that part made me mad. the only good part was were the predator stabs the queen in the head that was cool. really the only reason i saw the movie was that predator was in it. they also made the predator wimpy he had a soft spot.predator does not even kill the queen like it would really survive after what he did to it.the movie was ok at the time when i saw it i thought it was the coolest movie.they also should of used stan winston studios for the spiciel effects. overall paul anderson should stop directing he ruins comic books and video games such as mortal kombat,resident evil,and avp."
3,Good - But Could be better,"GREAT potencial, very god to watch, but a bit too short and definately needs more alien/predator 1 on 1 ACTION."
3,The Best There Is,Well I haven't seen the movie but I heard that movie was off the hook and I give 3 stars.
5,Very ejoyable,"OK, I am writing to rise the rating too, b/c the movie, inspite all its flaws and cut scenes, is a visual treat."
3,They totally ruined it for me...,"Aliens Vs. Predator was the most anticipated motion picture event of my entire LIFE (besides my constant hope that someday the musical version of Les Miserables will be translated into a movie). You don't understand what it did to me when I saw this. I was devistated. This movie is cheezy. PREDATORS KILL PEOPLE. PREADATORS ARE NOT PEOPLE'S FRIENDS. They become all ""friendly"" with the humans and it totally ruins it for me. Not to mention making the Aliens (the side I root for) so wimpy. I waited close to 13 years for this movie to come out and it was not good. It gets 3 stars because they finally got around to making it, and when push comes to shove, at least I got to see the acid bleeding, face hugging, chest bursting action on the big screen again... even if the movie did suck."
3,Point of view of casual fan of both series--,"I've seen the Alien movies and really liked the first two, liked both Predator movies, read some of the comics. I picked this DVD up and thought that the movie ran as smoothly, and as interestingly, as one of the comics. Like in the comics, there isn't a lot of character development here, but there are some violent thrills and a halfway decent plot.THE DVD EXTRAS: The extended version of the movie on the dvd helps you get to know the characters. The commentary by the director and two stars is just about the single best dvd commentary I have ever heard. The director explains what he took from the comics and some of the limitations he had. Lance and the director seem to be real fans of the Alien series.MY CONCLUSION: Not exactly high art, but what would a reasonable person expect from a movie with ""VS."" in the title? Good fun and not a disappointment."
4,very good,this was a very good movie directed by paul ws anderson. so if you loved resident evil or event horizon you will love this movie.
2,This movie is subpar AT BEST,"What do you get when you combine two popular movie franchises from the 1990's? Apparently the answer to that question is one very bad movie. The movie's over emphasis of the acidity of the aliens' blood was beyond annoying. The movie was tolerable until about 45 minutes into it when the plot took a turn for the worst. Honestly, I don't think that fans of either series were really looking forward to seeing the predators befriend any humans. Also, the scene at the end was strangely reminiscent of a Jurassic Park movie, I could just as easily have pictured a T-rex chasing the woman through a field of bones. If you're not a fan of either of the movie franchises, this movie could potentially pass as decent, for anyone else I would avoid it."
2,Filmed in Total Darkness,"I actually liked this movie, too bad it was so dark inside the pyramid that I could not see much of the action. Throughout the whole movie I kept wishing that the expedition crew would have larger flashlights or maybe the sophisticated predators installed a lightswitch somewhere!! you can tell millions were spent on the elaborate maze of tunnels and walls in the pyramid, but we can barely see them ! The only light during the filming of the action came from their tiny flashlights or the constant lighting of flairs. I hope the sequel will be filmed outdoors instead of caves and pyramids. I do love the predator costume/armor/latex makeup. I won't give away the ending, but you can tell it opens the door for a sequel. The final 2 scenes are outdoors so you can actually see the action."
1,I want those missing hours of my life back.,"I can't say enough bad things about this film. The ""extended"" version is crap. The new opening scene is absolutely pointless, it adds NOTHING to the film.Mr. Anderson promised us that the deleted scenes would be put back into the film, and the DVD version would be bloodier, and unrated.There really isn't deleted scenes. It's more like extended scenes, and there's only a couple. The commentaries aren't horrible, but they're only available on the theatrical version.So really what you get here is 2 versions of the theatrical release. There is absolutely nothing that makes this DVD worthwhile to purchase. Fox wanted to cash in on the fan base of two very popular film series', and that's exactly what they did.Save your money, and you're time."
2,Quite lame,i saw this crapfest in theaters. I regret it. I am only 15 and all these toned down horror movies are starting to get old. Not even the teenagers like me want to see this toned down crap! I regret seeing this movie and sadly even if this movie was rated R in theaters it still would have gotten only three stars from me. The plot was plain stupid and when the chick teamed up with the predator i was ready to walk out of the theater. Overall a bad movie either way.
1,Don't pay to watch this movie.,"I'm serious, this movie is awful for anyone that's over twelve years old. Words can't describe how incredibly bad it is. I rather watch Battlefied Earth again."
2,What were they thinking?,"How to ruin two perfectly good movie creatures...let 'em duke it out on Earth in a time before any of the other alien movies were made and have the king of jacking up a movie direct it. Anderson, you really have get another job. I think after this poorly done movie he hasn't any options left. The characters were no-namers (Exception of Waylon), the PG-13 rating took away something at all the other movies had (I don't care if a bunch of 12 yr.-olds want to watch it!!!), the action was blurry and few a far between. But the one good thing about it was it was over in less than and hour and a half! If you have any respect for any of the original movies, do not watch this! If you are a Paul WS Anderson fan, you have something seriously wrong with you."
2,Okay but flawed,"I've read the other reviewers of this movie. It isn't a very good movie and runs very contrary to the other predator and alien movies. However, I think it you looked at it in a vacuum, it wouldn't be all that bad. It was an entaining evening viewing and then I promptly erased it from my DVR."
2,too bad,After watching the seperate movies this movie is a bit of a dissapointment. The story starts actually pretty good with the discovery of a giant pyramid but near the end it sadly becomes a joke. Many people complaint about the lack of onscreen violence but you can do a lot more by imagination (e.x Blair witch project and Ju ON which use psychological terror and let the audience think for themselves but sadly this is not the case in this movie). Humans worshipping predators and building pyramids for them? Protagonist becoming friends with the predator? Making a shield with an aliens head? Protagonist and predator snowboard together? That sounds like a joke to me but it's all in this movie. Make the sequel better!
4,Stupid but very cool,"I have to admit that the basic story line and plot was fairly stupid. However, I personally feel that the battle scenes between the Alien and Predator more than made up for this. I guess it comes down to the mind-set you are going into the movie with. If you don't go in expecting much more than a basic shoot'em up movie with cool special effects then you will be pleased."
2,Hard to hear over the snoring,"The special effects were okay, but the story was weak, silly, and predictable.As a kid I loved the Alien movies. Aliens (the 2nd one) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh about how my mother caused M&M;'s to rain down on the theater after an alien scared her. So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories.What a disappointment. It wasn't scary at all. People in the theater were actually ***SLEEPING***. I was jealous of them. I was mostly glad that this was a short movie. Sadly, the scariest thing in this movie was a penguin.Don't see this. If you are a big alien or predator fan and must catch it, wait for video or HBO."
2,wrong title - Studio vs Director,"Sorry, if you really are into the Alien and Predator movies, then I suggest you watch this on Cinemax (now running it and see if you want to buy it this version). With the protracted and harmful battle between the director and, once again 20th Century Outfoxed winning to make it good for the kiddies, adults lose out. So guess what will come down the road 6 months to a year from now? AVP-Director's Cut (THANKFULLY). I will wait to buy until then.Movie makers are going to have to learn that the under 16 crowd is the movie goers these days. Movie theatres are used as a ""babysitter"". But you CANNOT gear all movies to that audience and have to make choices that stop this dumbing-down of movies. Why there are so many box office failures of late.So great premise, one we have waited for since Predator 2. Shame that had to short change us in order to make it for the children's bucks.Wait for the Director's Cut Edition which will be coming shortly, I am sure."
3,Not bad,"With a story based on a PC game, the negative feelings of these movies is purly justified. Although the story is quite good it still resorts to many old cliches such as the cool fad of ""MTV"" editing and the lack plot, as linear as it is. It still has its quirks but you are left feeling yes it has good effects and yes it has an alright story... but not much else."
2,this should have been a comedy,"what they should have done was created the uneditted rated R version of this movie and that should have been the only thing released. after all the editting, they should have just left the rest of this movie out. i am a fan of both aliens and predator, but the plot of this movie was god aweful. money was the only reason this movie was released. it had it's entertaining parts. the fighting between the two monsters was decent enough. if only someone with a brain created a plot, it would have been worthy of praise. although i really can't see how they could make a coherent plot to support the two characters and integrate them with our planet. rent this if you have to, but don't buy it unless you are just finishing up your collection of the aliens' and predators' series. just trying to save you some money."
2,Huge Disappointment!!,"I can't agree with the previous comparisons more. What an insulting flop! While I did enjoy the production value and the concept of the film, it's all wrong!! Give me Aliens Vs. Predator in space! The whole thing should have happened on another planet and in the future. And to think they continue to ruin this story again in AVP2!Another point astray from the original scripts...In the first two Predator films, the Predator comes to hunt in very warm hot climates. This tells me that these reptilian-like creatures wouldn't fair well in sub-zero temperatures.New script please!!"
4,Great Fun,"This is a super rendition of what is (surprisingly given its subject) one of Offenbach's most jolly operettas. Lots of good music and foot tapping tunes. The cast handles their roles well, with very clear diction, though without any voices that are particularly outstanding. It is fortunate that pronunciation is clear, since there is no libretto and the leaflet with an essay by William Parker is pretty useless. Furthermore, the tack index also is not much help about who is singing or which parts are spoken -- and there is a lot of dialogue, some witty, some dull, but none of it particularly rewarding on repeated listening. The sound quality -- probably a radio broadcast since the orchestra and Chorus are ORTF -- is fine -- much better than one would expect knowing the recording is billed as being of a one-off live performance."
5,a return to christmas,"A RETURN TO CHRISTMASI think that this is a very good book I really liked it, it gets you so addicted.When you start to read it you can't stop it stays on one topic most people in my class have gotten confused towards the some people really liked this book it was a perfect Christmas story. If your one of those happy Christmas people.Well this story is about a poor child named Chess. and a rich boy namedArtames then they go to a store called Nordstroms. then when Chess try'sTo steal some clothes from there and then Artames steals Chese's clothes when ``they both got hit by a truck then they switched places and then somewhere in the story Artey hitches a ride home on a diesel and has a merry merry Christmas.by kids"
3,A Return to Christmas,The book A Return to Christmas is basically about two boys that end up switching places. But there are a few things that go wrong. They end up switching places so Chess is actually Artemus and Artemus is Chess. They end up going to Las Vegas and getting totally confused. They wonder where they both are. So they both have to act out each others character to blend in and to be normal. So things get a little suspicious. Find out what happens.A Return to Christmas is a pretty good novel I mean if you wan to read it at Christmas time. But in some parts it can be a little confusing. It does get a little confusing when Chess and Artemus switch places. And at sometimes it switches back and forth to one story to the other. There are other characters in the book that you might think that are a little exciting in the book. But from what I have herd the ending is a total shock. So if you like Christmas stories I think that you should read it.
5,This was a very good book!,Chris Heimerdinger is an awesome author. I have all his books. A return to christmas will be a good movie and I am looking forward to seeing it.
5,Wow,"I got this book for Christmas from my parents. On a car ride home from my grandparents, I picked it up. From the very beginning, the first sentence, I was rivited. I only put it down to take my coat off. It was finished in two hours! I think it was way to short, but would recommend it to anyone and everyone."
3,A good flowing album and interesting,"I cannot agree with the reviewers that think this record is crap, but niether can I agree with the Hendrix association! But I like it. It actually shows that this guy really enjoyed playing the guitar and could adapt to many different methods of playing. Jason's career probably went as high as it could in the rock world when he play with Roth. It would be interesting to know whether Roth heard some of this material before Jason's audition. What cannot be denied is that if a 17 year came into a studio even today and played like this, heads would still turn. So it has some timeless properties to it, without a doubt."
5,JASON RULES FOREVER ! ! ! !,"Ok, first of all, I`m a big fan from Caxias do Sul, Brasil. When I first heard this album, I`ve said ""OK, Jason IS the best guitar player of all times! "". Not only you`ll find great music Ideas, but also amazing shred guitar playing, amazing Blues playing, Jazz, Rock, Metal...Jason can play any style of music. He also shows great sensibility in a lot of tracks. And one thing for sure: there`s no studio tricks. Is all Jason`s magic. When I`ve read another review, saying his playing in this album is ""lackluster"", I couldn`t believe. I have one thing to say to all of you who haven`t listened to this album yet: BUY IT! ORDER NOW!"
1,Just a big raspberry,"Whilst reading the previous reviews that make this album sound like it's the greatest piece of guitar playing CD around, I have to say 'rubbish'. The sound quality of this record is poor, the rock chops on it don't have any commercial value whatsoever, hence the reason why they were never released in the first place. The compilation of tracks is dire and after just one listen has ended up collecting dust in my CD cabinet. Be realistic, we have already heard the best of Jason Becker, and now all that we hear is the release of old guitar licks from tape in a desperate attempt to keep the bank roll going. To say this CD is a master piece is a joke."
4,Man!,"I have ben playing guitar for about 4 years and I have been looking for some other guitar players besides Greg Howe, Vai, and others like that and I went looking and I found this CD and man I was completly blown away .Just listening to this cd for 5 min. you will get hooked. I have already bought his other cd and one with Marty is on the way.He has so much harmony, speed,and style and his music is so beautiful.When i found out about ALS, and that he cant play any more it made me almost cry this has never happend to me before. He will always be my favorite guitar player. Go buy this cd and any others with him you will like what you hear. (I hope you will play again Jason and i hope you get better).Peace out Yall and enjoy the sweet tunes.Bill"
4,genius interrupted by disease...,"OK, so Jason's music ain't Bach, but I'll tell you what, I've played music for over 15 years, and of all the Mozart,Bach,Beethoven I have heard, Jason's music has the same understanding and genius to it. I was a little dissapointed by the sound quality of a few tracks,but the insight into how his brain works is there..He is as good a composer as he is/was a musician. When I am really down in the dumps Jason's music is comming out of my speakers before the old classic dead guys (whom I have a great respect for..) And when Jason and Marty Friedman get together...dont even get me started ! The only reason Bach didn't play electric guitar is he didn't have one ! Have a good one !"
5,Jason will ALWAYS rock in my mind!!!,"Well, I haven't even officially heard Rasberry Jams yet (because it hasn't been RELEASED here!!), but through my 13 years of guitar playing, I believe Jason would have become the hands-down most talented guitar player of the 90's, if it weren't for ALS.. Anyway, I hope this album is in the vein of Perpetual..... Jason, whether or not you ever get to pick up another guitar, you will always ROCK in my head!!"
4,Really good information about how to start and run a small business,"I have used material from this book in my lectures to my university freshman business students. Ms. Stewart does not use so many formal business terms which is why I use the book as a reference and recommend it to my students. What she says though is often right out of the business texts that we use in class. Love her or hate her, Martha is an excellent example of a highly successful entrepreneur."
3,Please stop with the MSLO marketing,"Martha, I love yah, but you have to stop plugging one product via another. Between plugging your products and your magazines on your show, to the blatant MSLO plugs on the Apprentice, to this book...please just stop. Your essentials are the essentials, that is true. And, you have great ""stories"" to share about other's successes (which read like someone else researched them as the writing style seems to change in your book with those stories), but give me more of the real Martha. Tell me about what you heard people that work for you say when times are bad and how you may have really had to take it to heart. Tell me about how you put on your filters with all the people that come to you with opinions and ideas and how you process that. You say you have files and files of ideas, but I am starting to see your outputs as recycle bins of the past. I love yah, but turn off the marketing machine and take us back to your beginnings."
3,Mediocre,"I opened ""The Martha Rules"" with great expectations, but was a bit disappointed. I've put the book down at the halfway point - I will get back to it, but it isn't a ""read straight thru"" enticement. The book is small in scope, so perhaps she will expand at a later date, but I will continue to rely on Jack Canfield's ""Success Principles"" instead.I'm a fan of Martha Stewart, but this book didn't resonate with me."
1,Great if you're in love with Martha,"I didn't realize that this book was going to be a series of 'I did this' anecdotes. I feel like this book was a way for Martha to feel better about herself. She recounts several of her successes while making light of her stay in prison. In my opinion, this book was politically motivated.Not helpful at all."
5,Great read worth the price and much much more,I will say that this book is very helpful if you are looking to open your own business or if you own your own business she tells you her secrets to sucess and how to build your business in a responsable mannner
2,Don't break your arm patting yourself on the back.,"Wow, how could you drone on about nothing for so long. This book reads like an abbridged version of any qualitative text on running a business - lots of have a big idea, listen to your customers, and hire good people. (As opposed to what?) The only part left out was watch out for the Feds.This book is a definite look into a company founded on ideas, and the packaging of ideas. Forget about exectution and learning much about execution. As Martha explained they leave all those details up to their partners. After reading the rules, I think Martha left out the biggest rule of all - constantly hawk your products like you are P.T. Barnum.I found the section about the Apprentice interesting. She might be reconsidering that ""wonderful"" idea considering the ratings."
1,"Is Lying a Smart ""Business Decision"" Like Going To Prison?","Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a ""business decision""? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this ""criminal spectacle"" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company?Be ""thoughtful"""
4,Martha does Rule,"When looking for information on how to do something, don't go to people who have never done it. Go to people who have done it; even better, go to people who have done it well. Martha is fun and knowledgable."
5,Martha Stewart's Guide for Sucess Fit For Everyone,"No matter what business you are in, THE MARTHA RULES, has something for everyone. Martha Stewart uses her own experiences in life and business to show that all creative individuals who are looking to make their mark can do so with just a little bit of hard work, a quality product or service and the right advice. Get it today! It is a book you will continually refer to for direction."
3,Seemed a bit thrown-together,"There was some entertaining stuff in here, but it felt very once-over-lightly, like it was thrown together in a couple of weeks, and probably a lot of it delegated to assistants. I don't care about the convicted-felon part -- and I think she handles that honestly and gracefully in this book -- but there is so much more that I'd like to know about her career, and I wish she'd gone into more detail. As someone else said, it seems like this was just a quick addition to the ""Let's rehabilitate Martha's image"" campaign. I'm not a business person, but I can't believe there aren't better books out there."
1,Not an accurate depiction of Asperger's,"This book seems to reduce Asperger's syndrome to a bunck of quirks oddities and compulsions. As a parent of a child with Asperger's, I worry that this book could create a dangerous misunderstanding of a very serious condition."
2,Professional and mom,"I am a professional psychologist and also the mother of a 19-year-old son with Asperger's Syndrome. I found the interviews in this book with individuals diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome interesting, which is why I gave it two stars. However, the book is ultimately infuriating because I can't figure out what the author's ultimate point about Asperger's is. He seems to say: (1) this is a real disorder; (2) it is a neurological disorder; (3) these people are really just harmless eccentrics; (3) the disorder exists partly, and maybe primarily, because of American notions of what is and isn't normal. Interestingly, those he interviews or discusses who fit closest to his view of harmless eccentrics who should be left alone, such as pianist Glenn Gould, are those with either remarkable and marketable talents or independent incomes. Those who would have to cope with life unbuffered by either talent or income fare much less well."
1,"A Little ""Information"" . . . a dangerous Thing","I really mean NO STARS but that is not an option. As not a parent of a child with Aspergers but a person with professional experience with kids who have it, I was shocked to find this book having so many factual errors. Osborne's barely veiled contempt for these peoples families shocked me, too. Who would think that in this day and age a discredited, dangerous fraud like Bruno Bettelheim would have such an equally misguided ""heir?"" There might be lots of diagnoses people with common sense could question (such as: compulsive shopping) . . . . but if you ever knew someone with AS and saw the endless challenges and the pain and the stress and the heartache AS brings, you would never doubt that this is ""real."" Osborne just doesn't ""get it."" ...."
4,Mankind in the next iceage,"Set in the future after the next ice age has destroyed most of civilization, this is a story about Dr. Catania Olsen a member of the Trappers tribe, a group by people living in the North at the edge of the glacial wall. Enough time has passed so that most knowledge has been lost. Civilization is still on the fall. It is a brutal time and life is very hard. Catania's tribe is attacked and forced to move.The tribe meets the Garden people, which live in the forest. There Catania meets the rather extreme one-eyed doctor. Catania must tread carefully with the half-mad woman.I enjoyed this story. It is creative and well thought out. We are not presented a world where humanity bravely steps up to and overcomes a challenge, but where it descends back into darkness and merely strives for survival.An interesting story."
2,No thank you,"A wonderful concept, discussing the possible world after a new Ice Age, is ruined by poor characters.The only character I DIDN'T find myself hating ends up...well, spoilers and all that so never mind.In any case, the vision is quite intriguing, but I found the execution severely lacking and it made for an un-enjoyable read."
4,Very interesting,"I was surprised by this book. I really thought it was a kind of pulp post apocalyptic thing, but I usually like that so I got it. It was far deeper and intricate than I anticipated. The characters were not cookie cutter carbons but had interesting fragilities. One moment in the book, where the women of the tribe, spend their last minutes shooting arrows into the enemy as their toddlers stood beside them nearly made me cry. Anyway, for pulp Sci-Fi, it was good. Peace to you."
2,Unfinishable,"I tried to like this book. I really did. I normally love post-apocalypse-type stories, and this one looked like a winner. Now, to be fair, the writing was not too bad, and the characters seemed well-drawn.Let me tell you why I got 150 pages in and then threw it down in disgust: The insane overabundance of ellipses. You know, when you see three periods strung together... Once in a while, such a device can add tension, etc. etc. But when you use them (and I'm not joking here) every third or fourth sentence, it quite rudely interrupts the flow of the story. But wait! It gets worse! There were several dozen instances where the author and/or editor apparently felt that just one ellipses wouldn't do. So instead there are two or three strung together, both on the end AND beginning of sentences. ......Kind of like this......Annoying, and ultimately unreadable."
5,this is a [great deal]!!,"My 8 year old daughter received this for a Valentine's present, and spent the rest of the night fighting myself, her dad, and her 16 year old sister to get to play with it! It is an awesome toy, and a great value ...As a matter of fact, that same night, I went back to Amazon and ordered five more, one for the 16 year old (at her insistence), one for my husband (a 38 year old kid at heart), and the rest as gifts for our nephews. I highly recommend this toy. It is extremely detailed, and the Krusty controller is a riot!"
5,Man this toy ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"By Mr.AWhen I first got this toy I dieing to play with it.When my momgave it to me I ripped it open,put batteries in Bart's skateboardand rolled away I played with it all the time.It is a REALLY,SUPERBLY,FANTASTICLY, AWSOME TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I think you will definetly enjoy it."
4,A cute toy,I brought it for my 15 months old and of course it might be too advance for him and my husband and I end up playing with it. I works on carpet and he will do a wheelie with his skateboard. My tot end up following it around !!!
5,Excellent,This is a very good dance-instruction video. It is well thought out and planned for optimal learning and very well enacted. It makes learning Lindy pretty easy though I would definitely recommend learning East Coast Swing before Lindy. The DVD itself would not play on one of my players so beware of that.
4,Nice fountain.,"This fountain pretty much looks just like it does in the picture. Keep in mind it is not real concrete or metal and is very lightweight. My only complaints are (1) the interior pump hose is bright, clear plastic with a hint of translucent blue; looks very fake so I painted it brown. (2) The little black pump stands out in the bottom of the fountian, so I put decorative black stone in the bottom (that also weighs it down more). If you do those things, then it becomes a five-star product."
5,great parfum,"The odor on this one is really good,i bought as a present for my husband and he love it,really.The price is good,as well as the free shipping."
4,Good read but not as good as The Manor,"After the Manor and the Estate, this book was not quite on par. Same theme, well drawn characters. Towards the end, tho, it seemed a little rushed, suddenly trying to expand on previously minor characters. I found myself skimming, trying to get back to the main people. Perhaps I shouldn't have read them back to back. Very informative and interesting, tho."
3,A dark story of Polish Jews at a bad time in history,"The story takes place in the first half of the 20th century, a bad time to be a Polish Jew. We know that the Nazis are right around the corner. This is not a story of Nazis, though. It's about the very active but painfully confused lives of Jews caught in between traditionalism and the modern world. Warsaw is as lively as New York's Lower East Side when it was throbbing with the vitality of Jewish immigrants. The main character of this book, Asa, is a young man whose grandfather was a revered rabbi, but who doesn't really believe in anything himself. His personal life is shattered, not only by traditionalism, but by his own modern faults. It's a good book but it's something of a train wreck, which is why I don't give it 5 stars."
1,I should have read the other reviews,"I didn't think that artists like the Smith's would lip-synch their songs on an English TV show. This was a terrible DVD and I'm a big fan of The Smiths. I was expecting something like ""The Complete Jam"" DVD, which is an incredible slice of music history. Don't buy this unless you have to own every speck of media generated by (for) The Smiths."
4,Smiths: The Incomplete Picture,"For those of us who didn't have access to TotP back in the 1980s, it's nice to see these performances similar to those given by the Pogues and New Order on other DVDs. I bought this, trying to get some of my favorite videos from childhood on DVD, but the reliance on the TotP performances has resulted in a criminal offense to this Smiths fan: THE VIDEO FOR ""SHEILA TAKE A BOW"" IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.Granted, it was a straight (Can we use that adjective in relation to Moz? Sorry, cheap joke.) performance clip that kept switching hues from green to blue to purple, but if this is supposed to be ""The Complete Picture,"" why isn't it included?I have a special place in my heart for that video as it was the second video I ever saw on MTV (first was Modern English's ""I Melt With You"") and it's MIA status prevents me from going all the way to five with this DVD.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,The Smiths - The Complete Rubbish,"I love The Smiths. One of the best bands in recent history. But their videos are low-budget cheese. This DVD does have a couple nice moments, but overall, it was a big waste of money.Just buy the audio CD ""The Singles"" and you'll get MORE of their greats, and you'll be sparing yourself the agony of these trashy videos.The technical quality of this DVD is fabulous. Crystal picture, with uncompressed linear PCM audio for the ultimate in sound clarity. Spartan custom-made menus. No bonus stuff. And the back cover says running time appx. 50 minutes. Really, it's 47 minutes minus 2 minutes for credits... 45 minutes of videos."
2,unbelievablely inconsequential,"I've never been a Smiths fan, I've never even heard their music to speak of. That's why I rented this video, to see if maybe I was missing something. Maybe that lack of a pre-existing interest in the band disqualifies this review, I don't know. Anyway, I found both the music and the videos to be nausiatingly and insufferably narcissistic. The music seems to have very little structure, no real melodies. Just Morissey warbling in his ultra-fey, upper class manner. Add to this the fact that Morissey is as ugly as a boot, and the videos are very hard to watch. I suppose if you're already a Smiths fan, then these videos will satisfy."
2,Bollocks really,"As a long time Smiths fan I was hugely disappointed by this. I actually quite like the TOTP footage, but where is their ""William it was really nothing"" appearance, which was one of their best? Where are the actual live performances from the Whistle Test and the Tube which were just great? Of course, the Jarman mini-movies are here which is great if you like Derek Jarman. Frankly, this collection's pretty much bollocks and a waste of money. Nice to see the shrubbery again though."
4,Now you can WATCH the musical genii in action!,"Lots of great live videos from the club/top of the pops days. It's an hour of eye-pleasing, flower-throwing fun. And for those of us who were too young to remember The Smiths in their heyday, it's the only way we'll ever get to see the guys together."
3,Not So Complete,"I own the VHS copy of The Complete Picture. I love The Smiths, but I wasn't very satisfied with this production. I just felt kind of awkward watching it. The Smiths should be presented on film in a way that captures the same feeling you get when you listen to their music. Perhaps if they were legitimately filmed and recorded at a live performance, that could have been achieved, but then again being in front of a camera never appealed to them. Get this on DVD only if: If you are a big Smiths fan, you like the setlist, you don't care too much for the videos, but are interested anyway cuz you love 'em."
3,heaven knows im miserable now!,"Another dvd purchase of not quite knowing what to expect...a few oldies from the Smiths, but quite popular in there time...well worth buying if you are a Smiths fan!"
4,Worth it for the price...,"If you are a Smith's fan, this is an excellent collection. It's essentially the VHS tape in DVD form, so no bangs or whistles. But it is easier to jump to various tracks. Audio and visual quality are much improved.There are a few ""short films"" directed by the late Derek Jarman in it, for those who are fans. (Most notable is ""The Queen is Dead"".)And if you are not a Morrissey or Smiths fan, you WILL hate it. Period. Keep that in mind."
4,Fun and educational,"Yes, the videos are kind of corny, but this DVD is a real treat for those of us who were still learning how to walk when The Smiths were at the apex of their career. I liked how the DVD combined Smiths videos with some live preformances letting veiwers who maybe be new to The Smiths see them play. The sound quality is excellent reguardless of the shorthandedness of some of the videos. The only knocks I have against ""The complete picture"" is the length (50 minutes) and the ""The queen is dead"" flim at the end. If you like The Smiths you owe it to yourself to check this out, just don't expect to see amazingly artistic videos."
3,"good towel, waffle patterns work better","I bought these towels for use in a travel trailer. They dry you quickly and completely, but they tend to become odorous compared to the waffle weave micro fiber towels. They work well for dishes and hand towels, but for the shower and bath the waffle weave are more comfortable and dry better after use."
5,Product review,"This was exactly what I was looking for, was easy to find and was deliverd on time. What more could anyone ask."
5,Hard made easy,"I've done alot of studying of financial statements, but Higgins quickly pointed out some of my flaws in knowledge. He takes difficult material and makes it refreshingly easy. For example, Chapter 4 on sustainable growth is a must read. I never knew a company could grow into bankruptcy. In fact, I had a candidate in my portfolio. He takes balance sheets, income statements and statements of cash flow and writes about them in understandable language.Well, I've only studied a few chapters in depth. Can't wait to get to the rest of them."
2,"Lots of info, but poor explanations","I bought this book in October and have only finished it this May. I could only handle reading a page or so at a time because I found the style of this book awkward, stilted and difficult to follow. The 'conclusion' at the back of the book was particularly hard to read with the author evidently trying to impress the reader but failing to do so with me. The book also contained terminology and processes unique to the USA that was not explained such as GOP (which I found out through Yahoo is a reference to the Republican party) and 'auditor' elections. I still don't know what an auditor election is !There is no doubt there is good information in this book, but it lacks humour which makes it dry, and did not flow well. That's why I could only manage a page or so before having to put the book down for later on."
1,A masterpiece that won't be able to transcend time...,"This is not the book it purports to be. The rights to the book were bought by another company and the book was rewritten so much that the book is unrecognizable. I bought this as a reading copy to the older original version of the book(A 3rd edition from 1908). Man, was that a mistake. DON'T BY THIS BOOK! it's not the original, it's a travesty.<sidenote:Amazon mispelled the title(tracend?)"
5,In tune,"from reading this great book. Everything is made up of energy. Through meditation and quiet reflection, an attitude of gratitude... we become in tune. Find out how to manifest a better life and be in tune with the infinite nature of you."
2,IN TUNE WITH THE INFINITE,I did not like the book I received because it was not written as the original book. Passages of importants was not set in italic print as the original. I also found a typo error which made me think that this print was not edited properly. I have not gone through the whole book as of yet but was rather dissapointed in what I had received.
2,Type size very small,"It's really a shame as this is a wonderful book, which I read years ago.But the type size is so small and extremely tight on the pages.You'd be better off buying an used, older edition, hardbound, copy which will be easier to read."
3,Pool table is the best part,"Bought this to go on the top of a mini pool table. My son (6) and his friends (older and younger) use the pool table (not these games) 99% of the time. Mini version works well for pool, not as well for air hockey (with no air) or ping pong."
4,Rare Karla DeVito Tracks!,"This album is worth picking up for two very nice tracks by Karla DeVito: White Bird and Walk Away Renee. The arrangements are a nice frame for her voice, in fact Karla is backed by The Roches."
4,Beautiful gem of 70s music,"I can't believe nobody's reviewed this wonderful CD. Take some of the sweetest voices of the 80s singing songs from their youth - how can you go wrong? And you can get this for a buck - I paid $12 and it was worth every penny. Standouts are Walk Away Renee, Who'll Stop the Rain, and Baby, It's You. The Roches are just beautiful in the background of Walk Away Renee and White Bird - too bad they're only on three tracks. Buy this fabulous work and reminisce about a better time."
4,Just a heads up that this is not the UK heavy metal band,"The band description in the Desolation Angels link is mismatched with this recording. ""Anthem"" is not from the band with David Wall on vocals. The UK band's boxed set, ""Feels Like Thunder"", is available through [...](Since I've never heard ""Anthem"", I've given it 4 stars only to maintain the current average)"
4,Gets better with age,"When I first got this disc I thought, ""Its not as good as Dog Days"", and I sort of pushed it to the back of my collection. Well after pulling it out again and giving it a fair amount of playing time, I discovered how much I like this Disc. Still may not be quite as good as Dog Days, but it has a more of a varity of sounds and songs than Dog Days. This is just simply a talented band, and given the chance, if you are a country rock fan, these guys will win you over. Think Neil Young, Skynyrd, Jayhawks, and Son Volt, and Blue Mountain is in that catagory. Fine company indeed"
4,A good album from a great (overlooked) band,"Blue Mountain may never again record an album as great as their debut (""Dog Days""), but this one is pretty good. The first five songs are classic down home country rock (though ""Lakeside"" is merely a rewrite of ""Blue Canoe"" from the first album). After that, things get a bit more experimental and not as fun, though the disc closes with the rollicking ""Just Passing Through,"" which is one of their best-ever songs. These Mississippi homeboys (and one homegirl) deserve a much wider audience."
3,Torn away homework by Analve,"sentences:Declan is thirteen year old boy,who was forced by the police to leave Ireland and to go to Canada.In Canada his uncle's family wants him to stay but he often tries to escape.I like that Declans feelings were discirbed very good so I can understandhim better.Also there is a good describtion of nature so anyone can imagine Ireland better."
2,"""Torn Away"" and the Irish conflict!","We had to read the novel in our English class. We discussed the conflict of Ireland and its history. The novel is easy to understand even for Germans. From my point of view the story doesn`t deal enough with the recent problem. But it`s a good book for children in the age of 13 to 15, because of the nice content. It`s easy to identify with the characters and the main character's situation. But for dealing with the Irish conflict the book is useless. Sorry!"
4,Pretty Good,"For any of you who've read Shades of Gray, it's similar to that book. Declan is someone that is easy for kids to relate to. He's so full of hatred, and he doesn't know what to do with it. Naturally, he turned it toward the source. Unexpected twists hold your attention. The end is predictable, but over all it's a good story line. It's easy to read, but I recommend it for 13 and up."
4,Realistic but nice to read,"I read the book, because we had to read it in school.First the title meant nothing to me.After the first chapters, I thought that it will be a boring book. But later on, I enjoyed reading it more and more.I think it's easy to identify with Declan and other protagonists of this book. It's a story which is explained realistically with real problems of the modern life.I liked the contrast of the two ""worlds"", on the one hand, the world full of violence and hate, and on the other hand the peaceful and friendly world.It was nice to work with this book, because there were so many possibilities!"
2,Okay but not necessary,"I'd heard great thing from my waxer about this product, but wasn't terribly impressed. It is alcohol based, and it makes me think that regular rubbing alcohol could do the same job. Didn't do anything ""magical"" to ingrown hairs, just dried the skin, and kind of brought them to the surface (same result as rubbing alcohol). Okay product, but you might be better off with a home remedy of rubbing alcohol."
2,Skin Tend,"Hasn't helped me yet. But still trying. Product got to me fast though, so nothing against the company who shipped."
3,3.5 - an entertaining adventure,"I've read a few Norton novels, and liked them all. But I'm not familiar enough to rate this in relation to her other works. My opinion is strictly based on this book, without knowledge of characters/themes that are shared in other stories. It is an entertaining and easy read, and is well written. The theme of telepathy is featured, as well as an outcast character who discovers his own talents and confidence among native life on an unexplored planet. Not a great work of science fiction, but a satisfying book and one I would recommend."
2,Horrible!,This movie was horrible. I regret buying it. It had a good message behind it though but the quality of the film was horrible!
5,LOVE,"This is the best curl activator out there. I love it. My hair curls, holds its curl, and keeps its curl all day long. It is a little sticky at first but what I do is spray my hair, curl it, let it sit while I curl all my hair then run a brush through it or my fingers and it takes the sticky, strong feeling out while holding my curls in."
5,Great gift !,All of my friends love this video. Every year I hear from people how much this video brightens up their Holidays !
4,Great Christmas present,A novel video that simulates a fire in a fireplace. Great gift for someone who has everything.
3,"Pretty, functional, flammable","I lit mine on fire the first day I used it! It still works, but you don't wish to leave this on a cast iron skillet while the skillet is on the flame, which kinda defeats the purpose, right?At least the burnt part is on the bottom, and I can slip it on easy enough to move the skillet around."
4,Can you locate the lost treasure ship?,"From the back...You're spending the summer with your aunt Lydia on Orcas Island, in the Pacific Northwest. You've always been curious about the island's legend of the Onyx Dragon, a treasure ship that mysteriously sank off the coast over one hundred years ago. When you stumble upon an old letter, you decide to search for the ship and its precious cargo-the infamous emerald known as the Star of Asia. The letter provides you with three clues. Where should you look first?"
5,Great Product..Easy to Clean and Install,"I'm purchase and Installed a K&N air Filter in all my cars and including family and friends. I don't think you get a noticeable increase in HP in cars with cars with no modifications. But this filter is good because its reusable and pays for itself after 4 cleanings. It does flow alot more air than a stock paper filter. I've installed them on (BMW Z4, Toyota Corolla, BMW 330i, Mazda Miata, Buell bike, Path Finder, Acura Integra, ....) and never had problems. Every 5000-10,000 miles I take it out and use the recharge kit to clean and re-oil it, at 3000 miles I just take it out and tap the large trapped particle out and put it back in. If your busy just keep the old paper filter and put it back in your car as you wait for the K&N filter to dry out so you can oil it. (If you own a car like the Audi A4 turbo 1.8 or 2.0 motor, that take like 1 hour to get the filter out and put back in, you might want to buy 2 or wait for it to dry and do it once)"
2,showboating,"I thought the artists who slowed down the tempo were dragging out the songs as if to say, ""Look at me, I'm doing a Smiths song."" Showboating."
4,Best historic survey of Chinese costume available in English,"There may be better histories of Chinese costume, and there may even be more comprehensive ones, but I know of no more through history of Chinese costume in English other than this book. It is also lucidly organized by period and features numerous illustrations, but of period artworks and color sketches of period costume designs. An absolute must for the English-speaking scholar who wishes to become conversant with the outlines of the history of Chinese costume."
4,Cirith Ungol - 'King Of The Dead' (Metal Blade),"Good, second release by this {now} long-gone Los Angeles metal band, their 1984 follow-up to their debut 'Frost And Fire' and just as head-hammering. Tunes like ""Atom Smasher"", ""Master Of The Pit"", ""Death Of The Sun"", ""Toccata In D"" (nice heavy guitar riffs) and ""Last Laugh"" display their obvious influences from the likes of Deep Purple, Jimi Hendrix and possibly Budgie. Saw on their current site where it noted 'Death To False Metal' - so you know you're getting the real thing here. Line-up: Tim Baker-vocals, Jerry Fogle {R.I.P.}-guitar, Michael Flint Vujea-bass and Robert Garven-drums. A definite should-have."
2,I'm glad Gonzo found a gig after the Mupper Show!,"Ok, I admit that the Tocatta is way cool and they are talented, and the grooves are tres meaty, and, I have taken the lyric ""Born in a test tube raised in a cage"" as my motto, but I simply couldnt get past Gonzo the Great on vocals. I hope I don't get caught in the ""snapping jowls of the dogs of Doom!"
4,A Must for Painters,"This small book presents a wealth of information for oil painters of all styles and techniques. Perhaps the most useful chapter is that which deals with the changing optical nature of pigment in various oils. Ever wonder why it never quite works to paint a new image over an old one or why an underdawing plays such a crucial role? This chapter explains why. Though old, this book has not become dated. It remains an excellent companion to Ralph Mayer's handbook and Robert Massey's _Formulas for Painters_, and like them, deserves to be in the bookcase of any serious painter."
5,A must have for painters.,"If you wonder why a Rembrant looks so different from a Canaletto, and how you can be inspired to emulate the Old Masters, read this classic book. Written by a favoured Academic Painter (in a modern sense), it soberly describes the wealth of paint vehicles that can touch the surface of a canvas or a wood board. A wonderful eye opener for the neophyte, the student , and the careful, attentive painter."
3,"""Stories"" too short.",I was very disappointed the stories are barely that. More like sayings than what I consider stories.
4,Great Book and a Great Series.,"I have been a huge fan of Bernard Cornwell ever since i picked up the Archer's Tale book in Barns and Noble. Every time I finish a series I am looking for the next no matter what the subject. I am not that into our Civil War history for reasons I do not know., but this series has made me more interested and I am almost Sad to say I have only one Nathaniel Starbuck book left to read. This book was the hardest in the series for me to put down. I read it in three days. I would have finished it sooner but work got in the way. I did not know historical fiction existed until I found this author but now I am hooked for life. I HIGHLY recommend this book and any other book from this author."
5,Nate Starbuck lives on!,Book is in great shape and arrived quickly. Great Civil War series for those who enjoy the genre. Keep reading!
3,OK,"BATTLE FLAG is not one of Cornwell's best efforts, it suffered from spotty dialogue and weak characterization. I ordered it a couple weeks ago from amazon along with the new WWII novel THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and have to say that the new writer, Rustad, won that round hands down. But I still have the highest espect for Bernard Cornwell's work. I guess one can;t produce a winner every time."
2,"Civil war ""movie of the week""","Dashing, one-dimensional, yet able to survive war AND a dysfunctional family, Starbuck guides us through the civil war. The action is gripping, fast and frequent (okay, even well written at times); however, it isn't enough to offset wooden characters and dialogue. The history and facts seem accurate and real; but the story is mind-candy. One is reminded of a TV-movie like ""War and Remembrance"" in which the character's superficial romances and personal tragedies serve as a rest stop between ""Important Events."" I nominate Chuck Norris for the TV-movie version of this book and series. A ""4"" for historical accuracy and above average action."
3,battleflag by Bernard Cornwell,Following on from his previous books rebel and Copperhead This is the third book in the series Following Nathanial Starbucks adventures as part of the Southern army during the American Civil warHis commander Washington Faulconer is still determined to rid himself of Nate but seems to be thwarted at every turn.I found this continuation as good as the first two in the series and look forward with some regret to reading the last book and no doubt final out come for Nate
4,Great series,This series really help me peak my interest in the civil war. Cornwell is one of the best at historical fiction. A great story whilr learning at the same time.
4,Entertaining historical fiction,"The 3rd installment of the Starbuck Chronicles continues to follow the experiences of Nathaniel Starbuck and in my opinion is an entertaining read.I love to read fictional history and I love to read Bernard Cornwell. His stories contain excellent battle descriptions and loveable (and dislikeable) characters.If you are a fan of historical fiction, I wholeheartedly recommend most-anything by Cornwell. Battle Flag probably could have been better, but it kept my attention, it entertained me, and even taught me."
3,Okay - not sure how well on the long term,"Well I have been wearing Carhartt jeans now for a few years. I seem to be going through them quickly though (6 months or so per pair) So I looked for a cheaper solution. Decided on these. I used to only wear wranglers. These though seem very cheap and I dont expect them to hold up long at all. They are very tight fitting (expected because of the cowboy cut, but I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear and they are still tight). The belt loops seem to only have a single row of stitching unlike a web or X shape I am used to. When I walk my rotts alot of times I clip their leash on my belt loop, but I wont be doing it with these jeans. I am very hard on my jeans but I would suggest spending a little more and just go with the Carhartt. (Like $4 more) I will update the next time I buy a pair either way...."
2,MISLEADING SIZE,Ordered a 48... it's smaller than my all my 46s... sizing chart is not accurate on these... fabric is very stiff and copper color buttons look very cheap.
3,Dirty Beatniks - One One Seven In The Shade,"The Dirty Beatniks' debut, ONE ONE SEVEN IN THE SHADE, pokes fun at Elvis with its short intro, then lays into the beats of ""Don't Stop."" This was the heyday of big beat, and those influences are all over this album: the thick beats, the 303s. But ""Beatnik Bounce"" has have a hint of cheeky disco in it, and ""More Danger"" starts off with some moody downtempo before the requisite hip-hop sample drops. The mix of Spanish guitar and blippery of ""So Vou de Mulher"" also pops out. The synth pads and mess of ""Hypnotysin'"" provides a nice atmosphere that's missing elsewhere, as does the unabashed funk of ""Roger 'n' Andre"" that shoots unexpectedly into outer space. But overall, this album doesn't have quite enough to lift it out of the pack. There are some bright spots here, but the album stays too much in the shade of the big beat era."
5,Not just fish food,"My corals love it, too! Some eat the whole pellet, for others I grind a few pellets. I do that in my vitamix with a little water after pre-soaking for a few minutes. My corals have better color than ever and I believe they do grow faster. Also my Lawnmower Blenny, an algae eater, is crazy about this food.It's so funny watching him chasing the pellets."
5,"A very solid overall CD, thank you Dennis.","Back to the World is way better than what I've read about, for it stands strong with stand out songs such as my favorites, This is the Time, Call Me, Black Wall, Warning Shot and Person to Person are all spectacular songs but unfortunately are not known enough, these songs should be played on the radio at least, an excellent buy for true musical treasures, once again thank you Dennis."
3,Gracias,"Muy esperado ya que es raro, grupo formado por las voces femeninas de Sly & the Family Stone, lo unico que puedo criticar es que el sonido es pobre, yo lo saque del Long Play (acetato) y tiene mejor sonido mi cd que este que compre, que lastima, lo pobre del sonido radica en que los bajos casi no estan, esta marca de cds saco tambien un cd de Sister Sledge y sucedio lo mismo con el sonido. de cualquier manera como coleccion esta bien, y se agradece."
4,A good introduction to the Hong Kong Cinema.,Hong Kong Babylon is one of the better books about the wild and entertaining world of Hong Kong Cinema. The writers briefly touch all the bases with the information provided. Get this book and the one by Bey Logan and you'll have a nice overall view of this cinema.Strongly recommended.
3,A VERY FRUSTRTATING WORK,"This book could have been so much more that what it is. The author had interviews with many of the top stars and directors in Hong Kong Cinema, and yet the interviews of such notables as Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, Jackie Chan, and Michelle Yeoh are barely a page-and-a-half. While it does provide some wonderful information, the bulk of the book is plot summaries and reviews; while the summaries might be helpful, I think most people would have been more interested in what the people involved in the business have to say. Ultimately, my main take on this book is that it was a squaundered oppurtunity for the author to have access to so many well known stars only to reduce them to 5 or 6 comments in a book of this size. Magazine interviews are longer than the interviews found in this book. It's worth reading, but just speaking for myself, it was little more than a tease."
3,Not 6.5lb memory foam!,"This foam is decent. However, it will bottom out. I tested it on a hard surface and my heels reached the board. It works okay on a mattress. I wonder what the ""5.5"" and ""6.5"" numbers mean?"
3,Buy the originals,"This album is just a compilation of songs from the first two albums. However, they change the song order and leave out critical songs like Island of Domination. You are better off buying Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their original full versions. Especially Sad Wings, the album must be listened to in its entirety to be fully appreciated."
5,One of the greatest metal CDs of all time.,I have had Hero Hero for 10 years now and just had to write a review on my favorite Metal CD. If you are thinking of buying it don't hesitate. It is a mastepiece. One in a million.
1,Don't buy it! You are getting ripped off!!!,"As another reviewer indicated, this is one of Gull records/ Transluxe/ Koch records attempts to cash in on the Judas Priest name. This album, Genocide and The best of Judas Priest are substandard, unauthorized reissues of the first two Priest records, Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny.The sound quality sucks and there is no new material on these that you won't find on the actual albums. Be careful what you buy!! If it says Gull records, Transluxe, Koch records or Koch international on it you are getting ripped off. Support Judas Priest, the best heavy metal band of all time, and don't waste your money on this crap. Buy the real thing, Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny, which is still available through Cdnow/Amazon.Watch for the label!!!!!!!"
2,Ok.,"The quality of the berimbaus were not good. Too flexible. The parts that came with such as the arame, caxixi, and cabaca were good, however the verga was not good at all."
5,Some Info For Those That Want It,"First of all, this has become a worldwide electronic/rock/hiphop fusion classic, setting a standard that Prodigy and other electronic artists are still trying to match. (No offense to the Prodigy). I would just like to clear something up that I see very often misrepresented; Future in Computer Hell (Part 1)is not a 17 minute Opus. That song is only 3 minutes and ten seconds long and is a radio-ready rock anthem. It is followed by a few minutes of silence, and a bonus track called ""Mulu"" which lasts for 9:48 and is exceptionally cool."
5,Whoa Baby! Rev me up!,"Like techno, RATM and high paced tunes? Get this killer CD. Great to MTN BIKE to listen to while playing Quake 3.Tron - Defender of the Users."
5,Not like anything else,"I've been to 3 top online cd stores, and each have a review by some washed up 30 year old critic that says they try to be the Prodigy, but don't succeed, and that it is a feeble attempt. All are not true. It personifies something wholesome and new, with hardcore beats and ryhmes that keep you going. Dealing With The Roster is the best electronica song I have heard, and I've heard alot"
1,dull boring and insulting to christianity,"With all the books out there that make a buck by slamming the church, this one is actually ridiculous. The author is no Dan Brown by a long shot. Save your money, nothing new here at all. Pure trash"
1,Save Your Money!!!!,"I did a lot of research on mineral makeup and thought this would be a good one to try - was I WRONG!!!!!!The only thing in the whole kit that was good is the concealer brush - the powder didn't cover, and the concealer was heavy and DRY! I went with Mineral Essence -best mineral at the best price - trust me!"
5,Best concealer on the market,"Skin by Alison Raffaele makes one of the best concealers on the market. It's smooth and creamy with a high concentration of pigment. It provides great, smooth coverage, even when applied sparingly.Also, try her foundation sponges for perfect application of liquid foundation."
5,Fallen Heroes,"As you are reading though the tribute to the fallen, you see thenamesof each of the lost Firefighters scrolled across the bottom of the pages. Each page left me more and more with a sense of loss. I did not lose anyone that fateful day, yet, we all lost. The words you read are quite moving, the pictures mean more than the words and poems. Yet i am most moved by the names of those precious and brave firefighters name across the pages from the front cover to the back cover."
5,Thoughts from one who experienced the aftermath,"As an Urban Search and Rescue team member who worked at ground Zero, I found this book refreshing and insightful. There are few pictures of Ground Zero, which I thought was good. It's nice the author focused on the people and staion houses that make up FDNY, instead of the usual 9/11 books with pictures of the debris field at the Trade Center. Across the bottom of every page are the names of those who gave their lives in a valiant effort to save others. Photos of the shrines created in front of the fire houses serve to uplift rather than cause sadness. Instead of being depressing and dreary, this book drew out the pride I feel to be one of the members of this family-- the fire service. The books tell the story of not only the FDNY, but the city they protect and serve every day... and the pride those citizens feel in their fire department. This is one book about 9/11 everyone should read."
5,"Looking to understand the Bible better, look no further",This is a wonderful Bible. I thank my God for allowing me to find it. It relates things in the bible to things happening now in the world. It gives you a better understanding of Gods word and what he expects from us. I would recommend it to any one looking to understand the Bible better.
3,Spirit Filled Student Bible,The content was excellent but I had a time reading it. Fonts are too small. Passed it on to someone who could read it.
5,Very Satisfied customer!!!!!!,"When I received my Spirit Filled Life Bible I was alittle nervous to open it because it was used, but to my surprise, I couldn't be happier!!!! It arrived sooner than I expexted and it was in EXCELLENT condition!!!! All the pages are perfect!!! I'm so blessed to have found this bible in such great condition!!! Thank you so much!!!!I ABSOLUTELY love it!!!Thank you again!!!Sophia63"
4,Great Album to Rock-Out To,"Theme for a Major Hit is the second full length album from Chicago based rockers Hot Stove Jimmy. On this album the band ventures off into the land of rock while still maintaining their ska-punk roots. Front man Matt Irie (of the Mustace Diaries) drenches the album with energy and a clever viewpoint on everyday life. He even manages to make a song about a dog (""Foxy"") witty and fun. Having seen many of their live shows I can say that Theme For a Major Hit is the band's best work to date. My favorites are ""Sweetheart"", ""Good Dresser"", and ""Her Name In Lights"", but there isn't a song on the album that I don't like."
3,"Decent, but opticscould be clearer","This magnifier is decent for the money, but looking through it it seema a touch hazy in the glass. Still an okay product for what it is!"
4,"Concise, informative and practical.","A straight to the point aquarium fish breeding reference book which I found concise, informative and practical.Well organized and presented.Breeding instructions of more aquarium fish would be desirable.Not wasted my time and money. A very good book!"
5,Long-time User of Samba,"Samba has been my choice of cologne since receiving as a gift 25 years ago. My sons have started using more so I got them their own bottles. Clean scent, not overpowering, long lasting."
4,Mystic poems from the Celtic-Nordic Axis,"These poems connect the twenty first century reader with the Celtic past of Ireland, in a unique way: through the experience of the marauding Vikings. Wonderful poems with a mythic edge. Heaney is fantastic.Fans of Heaney's Beowulf translation will find a great introduction to his work here in this accessible group of poems."
5,Great blues and jazz,"This CD, of great recorded quality, is outstanding. It has a superb selection that showcases the Vivino Brothers talent for all kinds of blues and jazz. I would recommend this album for the blues and jazz lovers out there that appreciate great music."
1,Looks like home video.,"Save your money! There's much better waves videos than thischeep, bland, and dull video. I've enjoyed many other nature videosthat are much more colorful and relaxing. This one looks and feelsquite dated. I'd can't recommend it."
2,I wish they had a more exotic beach!?!,Nice video but I'd wish they had selected a more exotic beach like in Hawaii or someplace more tropical... It's not as soothing as I wished it would be- I got tired of it after 5 minutes...
3,Perpetua's Passion,"I found 'Perpetua's Passion really interesting, getting an interesting picture of Roman Society and attitudes. I finished the book wondering if the author, had some type of axe to grind in this society. I thought she tried to dismiss any notion that Pepetua and the other martyrs might have been truly holy or had any divine access to God. She was always giving another reason for what happened as though nothing spiritual was taking place."
4,"Good Book, story well told.",I like this book because I'm an western historical romance reader. Jillian Hart gives you the old west feel in her stories and yet you get a little of the drama and romance that keeps you interested from beginning to the end.
1,Not written to Love Inspired Standards,"Just a quick note to those out there who have read Jillian Hart's Love Inspired books. This book is sexually explicit. So if you are wanting to read Jillian's books, just be aware that they are not all in the same category. I tried to find out if this book was explicit before I bought it and could not find any warnings on it that way. The story did seem engaging but I did not want that kind of detail. Love Inspired books are written for the Christian Booksellers Market and if you check the Harlequin site, they have a very detailed description of what can and cannot go into Love Inspired books. It's not a bad guideline if you are wanting to make sure you have more control over the content you read. I am not panning her writing here, she writes fairly well. Just giving a head's up that not all her books are written to the Love Inspired standards."
3,For Suicide fans only.,"The performances are very good but the sonic quality is VERY rough - listenable, but just barely. Sounds like an OK bootleg - worth it for hardcore/super-devoted fans, but for novices, get either of the first 2 Suicide albums."
3,Combination it is not,While the blade is of excellant quality it functions much better as a cut off blade than ripping blade. You can rip with it but it is very slow.
5,Freud combination saw blade,By far the best saw blade I have ever owned. I installed it on my 50year old craftsman table saw and can rip a 2X4 like it was butter.
3,The African Mask,"The African Mask was a story full with an intricate plot. The plot of the story is magical, casting a spell on the reader to read more and more. However, although the plot maybe magical, the way the author doesn't have describe the characters and just provieds a list of characters in the beginning, so if you don't know a character you can just refer to the list. Also, I think the author's transitioning was really bad. At first I'm reading about a character, then suddenly the character dissapears from the story! However, although the transitioning and details may be lacking, however the plot is magical."
4,"""Tales that speak of Frost and Fire""","Although this is Cirith Ungol's weakest album it is nothing short of excellent. The flaws of this album lie mainly in Tim Baker's singing and in the production. Tim hadn't really developed his spine-tingling schrieking yet and the production is a little on the trebly side (obscuring the awesome bass playing). With any other band this would mean failure, but this band was so powerful even at half-steam that it will still kick your ass sideways. CU were sort of an anomaly in the thrash sweepstakes of eighties metal, as they still had one foot firmly planted in the seventies - and were all the more great for it. Recommended for fans of early Blue Oyster Cult, the MC5 (the production actually resembles 'Back in the USA' to some extent), Stooges, Pentagram etc."
4,Cirith Ungol - 'Frost & Fire' (Metal Blade),"Barely remember this Los Angeles based metal band. Didn't realize it's been THAT long, as this effort was origibally released in 1981. Really liked hearing this lp on CD reissue. Best tracks are ""I'm Alive"", the rocking ""A Little Fire"", ""Better Off Dead"" and the must-hear ""Maybe That's Why"" {possibly the best song this disc has to offer}. Fans of Mercyful Fate, Celtic Frost, Iron Maiden, Angel Witch and Lizzy Borden will likely eat this up."
4,Unknown master,"I admit I bought this CD because of Tina Brook's sidemen. Of course, everybody knows Sonny Clark, Lee Morgan, or Art Blakey, but Tina Brooks? Who is Tina Brooks? It is a shame he didn't nearly get as popular as other tenor sax players of the Hard Bop area. I guess one of the reasons might be that people just didn't get to hear him that often. If I understand it correctly, this album was first published in Japan in 1980. Which is a shame because it is so good that it should have become a real classic much earlier. Among all the Blue Note sessions I know there are quite a few which are way less interesting than this one. Tina Brooks and his sidemen create a very nice atmosphere which is fairly relaxed and it swings a lot. Art Blakey on the drums is superb as usual, Sonny Clark and Lee Morgan deliver very good performances, and Tina Brooks introduces you to his way of playing the tenor sax. Very nice."
4,Another Good One,"Unknown Tina Brooks, quite a story. He didn't live long enough or record often enough to develop into a true leader on the tenor, but he had a fine, personal voice in hard-bop jazz, and made a decent debut with this record, never widely released in his lifetime. The sound and the promise is there, as well as his personal voicing style in the typically tight Blue Note arrangements. He sounds a little callow though, not quite as confident as his assured band-mates. A good record nonetheless, and it displays the promise that would be fulfilled on ""Back To The Tracks"" and ""True Blue,"" which is one of the greatest Blue Note records of all time."
4,semi-classic,"men, this band is unknown and it's not fair...they're of the level of adverts, slaughter and the dogs or eater. there's a cover from The Equals: viva Bobby Joe. The band musically is great, pure punk rock, simple, with a good performance in some parts...some tracks are like recorded at the house of some band's member and sounds bad...if I don't give 5 stars to this cd is because some tracks sound like s#%t!!! and I'm not telling lies...there are some excellent songs that you must pay attention to get the tunes, or must tell your family ""shut up, I'm hearing my blitzkrieg bop cd than sounds like s#%t, and I want to underestand the music"". and obviously, there're track with good sound, and that's when the band turns interesting.it's a very good band. if somebody have some lyrics of the band please e-mail me: klaudio_k@hotmail.com"
2,Somewhere between odd and typical,"This edition reprints astronaut quotations in purplish color throughout. It is a weird choice, since the only other books I know of that do that are Bibles with the words of Christ highlighted in red letters. The color is hard to read. Aside from that, this book is about what you'd expect. It was written by an Australian, and so everything is slightly skewed toward the Australian involvement, which seems unimportant in the grand scheme of things if you ask me. I loved the movie The Dish about the Australian tracking station, but I can't seem to stir up any more interest in the subject. At least the film was comical and quite aware of its peripheral status--the book has no such perspective. See the movie The Dish and buy another book--either Chaiken's or the new one by Reynolds."
2,Legends... wit this.... i think not,"I like ATL i think there album Uncle Samz Curze is a underated classic. But LEGENDZ???? not a classic, not even mediocre, da beatz sound strained and da lyricz are tired. This only getz 2 starz cuz of da song Adventurez Of... easily the bezt cut on here, and one of da bezt of dere career. If u truly love ATL cop this, if u dont, find a way to get Adventurez Of... and leave this alone."
1,1 star is the lowest amazon offered!,"out of all the garbage I have heard(Mase's double up and Silk's made men)This is by far the WORST Rap album I have ever heard in my life! They dont even rap on all of the songs and the skits are dumb and not funny. This is the worst album ever! Ever! Go and buy it, I bet you wont even trade it in but you will throw it away. This is the Girl 6 of albums, Hugo(car) of albums. I want you to buy it so you can feel what I feel."
4,"Good, but not the best.","I'm still trying to find a Dutch processed cocoa as rich and flavorful as the no longer available Hershey's European Cocoa (Silver Label) which was cheap in comparison to some of the other Dutch processed cocoas I've tried since.This is MUCH better than Droste (which, in my opinion, is tasteless)-It is better than Penzys, slightly better than Double-Dutch Dark from King Arthur, but not as good as Bensdorp."
3,fatty,"has a lot of fat in it. wasn't aware of that when I made the purchase. no nutritional breakdown to be found. so can't tell how many calories either. so will be sticking with hershey's pure cocoa. not as good, but way less calories and no fat at all. i did try some of the brute cocoa. it tastes very good. but that's kinda besides the point for me as i want the cocoa for the nutrition and health benefits."
5,A page turner with surprising suprises,"If you're the type of reader who loves to see every side of a situation, you're going to love Day By Day! This story begins with a man and woman who are deeply in love. A horrible car accident throws them into a situation no one can possibly prepare for. Maggie's car accident changes the entire family, but what is life if not change? Maggie and Spence are endearing characters I rooted for throughout this entire story. I loved their little girls, the setting, and the side story of Maggie's sister, Jackie. I was on the edge of my seat during most of this novel. When I finished it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. (That doesn't happen very often.) Very well told. I highly recommend this one, as well as anything Sandra Steffen writes."
2,I really wanted to like it.,"This is the only time I've read a book that was later made into a movie, and came away certain that the movie was better.I get that William Peter Blatty enjoys exploring the connection between madness and evil, and pondering its origins, but if you're coming to this already familiar with The Exorcist (which I'm assuming most people are), it's going to feel redundant more than anything else. And well it should, seeing as almost half a page is reused verbatim in The Exorcist."
5,A must for anyone interested in Animals & Ethics,"When I taught a course on Animals and Ethics, I chose this volume over all others as my primary text. While Peter Singer's ANIMAL LIBERATION first awoke my consciousness to the tragedy of the manner in which humans have regarded and treated animals, I found the philosophical underpinnings of his work (a form of utilitarianism) troublesome (for reasons I won't go into here). On the other hand, I found Tom Regan's THE CASE FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS, to be far too Kantian. Midgley discusses a wide-ranging group of philosophers, but doesn't overly attach herself to any particular moral philosophy. As a result, she is less doctrinaire than any of the other major writers on the topic. The book reeks of common sense, in the way that the English so often seem to have mastered. Just a wonderful, unjustly neglected book."
3,Animals are Beautiful Souls,"Animals are living, breathing, feeling, living, loving, soul-filled children of God, just as much as we human animals are.Further, Animals can (and do) speak, only we ignorant human animals are too stupid to take the time to listen.We human animals are legends in our own minds.Animals deserve the same love, respect, compassion, and consideration that we afford to anyone else.Animals have souls....... eternal souls.To think otherwise is to be ignorant, arrogant, speciesist and one other thing: Wrong.I highly recommend the book ""The Souls of Animals"".It is much better than this book, and the author is much more enlightened than this one is, with all due respect.Adopt a Cat or a Dog at your local shelter, bond with your new best friend,...... watch, listen and learn from them, and find out what true love and true evolution is all about.""Man has alot to learn from the higher Animals""-Mark Twain"
5,Suspenseful till the end,I think this was her best book to date and thats saying something! She has wrote some really good books. It was suspenseful it kept you guessing till the end. Its one of the most exciting books I've read in a while.
3,Unsatisfying,"Lisa Gardner draws very interesting characters, but there are a lot of holes in her plot. The biggest hole: she doesn't say how the killer, who is obsessed with Rainie Conner, comes by his knowledge of Rainie's deepest, darkest secrets. He just happens to know the truth behind what everyone else has only speculated about for fourteen years. And the action is unevenly paced, ending almost abruptly. I found this book at a used-book sale and bought it because it started out very well, with characters and dialogue that got me involved right away. But even the most fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue in the world cannot compensate for the lack of a consistent and airtight plot."
4,captivating suspense,"The Third Victim is definitely Gardner's finest work, with local police woman Raine working to solve the school shooting involving the police chief's son. Gardner's novels are well-researched, which adds to the realism. Add to that her fine writing skills and you have a top notch read on your hands. My only complaint was the 'surprise' twist about the heroine's past. Anyone familiar with Gardner's category roots will recognize that as a retread from Hiding Jessica. It really seemed superfluous and detracted from the mystery itself."
4,Great Read.. But Definitely Not the BEST,"I really enjoyed this book, it keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what was going to happen next. I've read pretty much all of Lisa Gardner's books and waiting to read more. But if you really want a ""I have to finish this book NOW"", book by Lisa you should read Next Accident. That book by far is her best."
4,Good Book...,The book arrived as stated. It was used and thus it did have one page where there was part of the page missing...not enough to cause any major concerns. I was able to still understand what was happening despite part of the paragraph missing.
2,Not as good as other novels by the author,"I am sorry to say that I really did not enjoy this novel as much as I have enjoyed the other books by Lisa Gardner that I have read. Primarily, I did not think that the book ever got to the point, but was constantly being side-tracked by romance, the female detective's family history, the family history of Danny, etc. Also, I felt that the principle characters were left hanging, with no real conclusion being drawn as to what happens to them. I purchased this book on audio disc, and it did not live up to my expectations."
3,A thriller turns into a whodunit,"This my tenth book written by LG and most have been four or five stars. This novel has interesting characters that are well defined but there are some plot flaws and often I was left thinking, ""How in the hell did she/he know that."" About half way in the book, I actually stopped reading and wondered how these arcane sub-plots could possibly be explained in relation to each other. The answer; suspension of disbelief in a big way. All that being said, LG told the story in such a way that I did not want to stop reading - I had to find out how it all ended - good or bad.If you want to know all about the history and background of school shootings here in the US and want to listen to characters being psychoanalyzed, then this might be the book for you.Oh, can you imagine a school shooting without even one big press conference?"
2,What a stretch.........,"The Third VictimThe story starts out interestingly enough and then it all falls apart as the plot unfolds. The Sheriff's son is involved in multiple murders at his school. The Sheriff is actively interfering with the investigation. The lead investigating officer is Rainey Conner. She works under the Sheriff. Conner has a long personal friendship with the Sheriff and enough personal baggage that normally would prevent her from ever being a cop in the first place. Holy comflict of interest Batman! State and Federal agents are called in but who is in charge, the admittedly unqualified, conflicted, unstable, Rainey Conner! Oh Please!!! If you removed the unqualified cop, had a realistic chain of command with the investigators,and put the Sheriff in jail for interfering this might be a good read.My suspension of disbelief button was pushed too many times on this one."
2,Not Very Good...,"I didn't like this book for several reasons. The school shooting theme is very disturbing to me and I honestly don't think that the author did a good job exploring or explaining that issue. Another reason I didn't like the book was because the Rainie character was severely irritating. I'm so sick of the ""macho"" woman in these suspense thrillers. Rainie needs to grow up and get over herself. Lastly, the villain in this book didn't make any sense. His motives and reasoning were stupid. This book had potential, but fell flat."
1,Here we go again.,"An interesting start goes downhill very quickly. The female cop is of course ATTRACTIVE, single, fit as a fiddle and has the HORRIFIC MURDER OF HER MOTHER constantly on her mind. All main character cops in books these days have brutal memories of murdered members of their families. The murderer is also gives us his/her thoughts and SINGLES OUT THE ATTRACTIVE COP AS A FUTURE VICTIM. Cops and detectives are the prime intended victims of serial killers in today's mystery stories. Of course ATTRACTIVE FEMALE COPS ALWAYS MEET HUNKY, LEAN AND BEAUTIFULLY MUSCLED FBI, DETECTIVE, SPECIAL AGENT, or something, with his own HORRIFIC FAMILY DISASTER and FIGHTING/ROMANCE ENSUES. This plot is so shopworn, overused and boring that reading it becomes a chore....wait a minute, the chore is over...I'm a third of the way through and have stopped reading this book. This is the second book I've tried by this author and both have been graded D. Get original Ms. Gardner."
2,"Unsatisfying, Not Her Best..","Unlike some other reviewers who love everything, this book was NOT a hit for me. I've read Both of Ms. Gardners other books and enjoyed them but this one wasn't great.The suspense part was just ok, wondering who-done-it and especially why. Even the ""why"" part was a bit shaky. But the ""romance"" element was basically non-existant and pretty lame. Not the greatest ending I've ever read either (won't say more and ruin it for you). Better luck next time Ms. Gardner."
1,I Don't Get It,"How did the watcher know Rainie's secrets? Didn't anybody ever wonder what happened to the guy who killed her mother--he had a wife and child. Was he a local man? What did Rainie do with his body when she moved it? How did a man as young as Richard Mann supposedly know so much about what Rainie did? It seemed as if he knew what ""really happened"", then somebody says that he thought she killed her mother and was disappointed that she didn't. This book didn't make a whole lot of sense. Halfway through it I remembered I had read The Other Daughter, and I didn't like that one either."
5,Why six stars?,"The least of the times you take a book is to learn something really important. You read a book to have a good time, because someone gave it to you or any other reason you like. But when you read a book and you understand why are the killings at schools. What are the kids' main problems. That the deans has their own life and own problems and those problems implicate the students, maybe before you send your kid into a new school you'll want to know the background of the teachers and deans.At the end you'll think about the life of the police, their problems and how they solve them, the end of the book is not a happy ending, but it deserves SIX stars."
2,The Third Victim,"This was not as good as ""The Perfect Husband"". I kept waiting for her to get to the point. Too, much time in between waiting for something to happen. I was disappointed."
4,Good enough to listen to (over and over...),"I really hadn't noticed how much I liked this album until I realized it had been in my car CD player for almost a week straight (and I commute 30 minutes each way, so I probably heard the album 11 times in a row). The thing is, there's nothing spectacular about it. It's just 15 good, quality, catchy pop-rock songs that don't get old quickly.I would recommend this to fans of Myracle Brah (obviously) as well as fans of Fountains of Wayne, Owsley, weezer, Cotton Mather or any other guitar pop groups out there.You'll probably have to get it used, so get it while you can."
2,Most Overrated Baltimore Group,"Love Nut's debut wasn't bad, though the production was more than a little flat. If you combined it's best tracks with the four or five good ones on Baltimucho, you would have a pretty stellar album. Sorry, I'm not a member of the cult of Andy Bopp."
2,It was probaly really good when it came out.,"About a year ago I bought this album along with the debut and time.This was the first disk I put in my player and I only found a few good songs.The grunge and hard-rock thing going on gets annoying after a while.(But we all have our own opinions.)I recommend debut,time,come together,or the offerings.But,if you do buy this, listen to the clips."
3,Third Day vs. Creed,"I have listened to this album and I would personally recommend any other album by Third Day before I would recommend this one. I would also like to respond to the comments about Creed. I find it very dishartening that anyone would compare these two bands. Third Day is a band that creates music the way it was intended by God, to glorify Him and His name. I have seen an interview with Creed and they dont claim the name of Jesus in anyway. I am not being judgmental, that is fact. I just wanted to clear up any confusion that was stated by other reviewers."
2,Lady of Green Cheer 'says',I love every other CD done by Third Day. This one just did not stand up to what I have come to expect from this group.
3,its not Pearl Jam,The music is OK. I definitely like their newer stuff better. I bought this one because I read somewhere that it sounded like Pearl Jam. Mac Powell sounds a lot like Vedder but the music is different. Its good for hardcore Third Day collectors.
1,YOur Wrong Jenny Person,"Creed is by far better than this petty excuse for a band. These guys are terrible compared to creed. Creed is original and they sing about life not about god. NOt everything has to be focused on Religion. I saw Creed live and they rocked. Man THird day is terrible. I warn n e one who is not very religous, Dont Buy the album. You should not down size bands like creed jenny. do you know them personally. Then who are you to make false judgments on people you dont know. I recommend buying creed Human clay or My own prison"
4,Finally a good christian rock CD,"Third Day is a great rock band that happens to play Christian music. This disk contains some good, hard rock with Alien, Peace, and Have Mercy, but throws in a more personal touch with My Hope is You, I deserve, and several others. If you're a rock fan that wants to get away from some of the questionable lyrics of mainstream bands, you'll probably like Conspiracy."
3,A Mediocre Book by a Great Man,"I admire Orrin Hatch, and was thrilled when I stumbled (literally) across this book during a Christmas shopping excursion. The most interesting parts were Orrin reflecting on his decision to run for Senate, and the process of that campaign. Also interesting was the Clarence Thomas confirmation and the resulting controversy. Far less interesting were his long tangents on the Labor bills and others that I'm too lazy to recall. I love politics, and enjoyed this book a decent amount... but I fail to see how anybody who isn't both a diehard conservative and a political junkie would be able to finish this book. It can be pretty tedious at times. That being said, Mr. Hatch is a great American and I salute him."
4,A Complete Surprise,"I found this book to be a complete and pleasant surprise. Contrary to what one might think, the book is actually an interesting, instructive, and revealing look at the political process. Senator Hatch makes legislating seem real and more thoughtful than one would ever guess from the evening news. I never thought I would read a book by Orrin Hatch and laugh out loud. I still don't agree with all of the positions he takes, but you do grasp that there are actual humans hiding behind their political stereotypes. It's a quick, easy, but surprisingly fun read."
2,Does Not Charge,"I bought this for my S51 camera thinking it would power the camera and also charge its battery (when the battery is normally inserted in the camera). It does not charge the battery of my S51. I need to contact Nikon to inquire about this, but if you want an AC adaptor that will also charge the battery, then do not buy this one."
5,The Kiss & Its History,"An eloquent, lyrical, beautiful and ultimately sublime chronicle of the kiss. Attempting to define and categorize the kiss (& it's origins) based on different cultures and their poets provides a vivid and romantic commentary. This is a book of poetry, history, sociology, and osculogy. Enjoy."
5,A Must have book,"This is definitely the best Maya character animation book I have ever read. Even though its a bit advanced, you can manage your way through and learn from your mistakes. the way every thing is illustrated makes the workflow a lot easier and faster. Another amazing feature in the book is the way the author arranged the subjects, it just makes you understand a lot better and you don't feel lost .I believe that any intermediate Maya user who is interested in character animation must get this book. Its worth it. because you learn many different techniques and achieve what beyond your imaginations."
4,Not for Beginners,"This book is a very detailed, extremely advanced Maya reference. I wasn't especially pleased with the organization of the material, and the book can be very difficult to read at times. However, I truly did find it useful while getting the hang of character animation. It's worth the effort to read it."
5,One of Smitty's better albums...,"Michael W. Smith comes through with another passionate album in Go West Young Man.While a couple of hits did make the pop music stations (Place in This World and For You as I recall), some other songs on this album hit a more personal, religious nature.Seed to Sow is one of my personal favorites on this album. Along with Smitty's fantastic piano playing you have a group of children singing in their native language...quite a sound to hear!!Angus Dei is a haunting yet touching praise song. This is not like his more recent albums, I'll Lead You Home or Live the Life, and yet its not like his earlier albums like The Big Picture and I 2 Eye. Instead, this album is more in-betweenish and will appeal to those that like the pop genre type of music. and yet are looking for something with a bit more of a religious theme."
3,Old School Michael W Smith,"Good example of Michael W. Smith's initial music. There are some catchy tunes and songs, but nothing terribly fabulous or innovative. I can tell that his music comes from the heart.Strong early 90's feel to the music; some songs have a pseudo-hip hop feel.Interesting to see how his music has changed over the years."
5,Wonderfull,"I grew up wit hthis album. As a child I remember listing to it on a tape deck.Go west Youngman just speaks to me,While Love crusade makes me get up and praise/dance.And the haunting melody of children singing to God. Agnus Dei always sends shiviers dow nmy spine. This album is soo good. Hey, im listening to it right now!"
5,THIS CD ROX!!!,"Michael W. Smith is one of my favorite artists. ""Go West Young Man"" is awsome...It features the hit song, ""Place in This World"" and his song ""Love Crusade"" about care."
1,False advertising,"The book was listed as 'good as new'. However, the condition of this book is obviously well-used. It's at least 20 years old and has a well-worn cover. They left the store price tag on it, and it was 7x as much on amazon. I would NOT recommend buying from this store."
1,Utter rubbish!,"More propaganda from a fanatical religious group that has a long history of manipulation of its members and deceit. Yes, they are a peculiar people, and not in a good way! If your a brainwashed mormon, you'll probably eat this up, if not it will scare the hell out of you and you will never look at a mormon the same again."
1,Wish I could rate it lower than 1 star.,"I really doubt anyone but a Mormon would even bother to read this book, much less buy it. However, don't bother - even if you are Mormon. You're probably getting enough guilt trips at church anyway. By far the most depressing, horrible book I have ever read."
5,Judas didn't say nice things about Christ either:),"I applaud the good reviews and caution you about the bad reviews.Matt. 10: 25... If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?http://scriptures.lds.org/matt/10/25#25Most of the negative reviews are pure fiction or at least twisted severely.If you want to know what a church believes -- ask them:)www.mormons.orgHope this helps:)By the way, great book!"
2,Believing Christ -- Better Understanding of His Atonement,"I am an active LDS member.This book was written before Spencer W. Kimball became the President of the Church.This book has President Kimball's personal views and many of his opinions on sins of omissions, etc are not necessarily inline with LDS doctrines.If you are looking to better understand Christ and learn how to utilize His atonement in your life, I would suggest you pass this book for a much better LDS book called ""Believing Christ"" by Stephen Robinson. The views shared in this book are significantly more inline with the teachings of the LDS Church and will really help you feel the tenderness of the Savior's Atonement in your daily life."
5,The Best and Clearest Approach to Repentance and Forgiveness,This is a frank discussion of sin especially sexual sin and the manner in which they ought to be repented. There are many like Laman and Lamuel who take the truth to be hard but this book is truth and it clearly outlines the path that must be taken. Sometimes we need frank gospel discussions that may not be pleasant and Kimball certainly offers that discussion in this book.
1,Broken,This book nearly destroyed my life. The person who wrote it did so without any understanding of compassion; it's only message is one of submitting to 'authority' and living a cookie cutter life.
3,Truth Is Not Always Popular,"In this work, President Kimball has endeavored to expound upon the effects of sin and the hope of forgiveness that comes through the Atonement of Christ. This book is probably not for those who read for pleasure, but rather for the serious student of the gospel.There are those who have expressed dislike for this book. All I can say is that the book contains absolute truths which are declared boldly, without reservation or equivocation. There is no deceit in President Kimball's honesty and straightforwardness. He has labored to expose the true face of sin and its ugly consequences. The truth can be hard to take at times, but it is truth nonetheless!"
5,miracle of forgivness review,"a special way to learn of the need for forgiveness and to be forgiven and to know that in todays world there is hope to return to happiness in this life,"
4,Perspective,"This is a book you will either love or hate. It will be the most offensive ""nightmare"" to those who need it the most, and a reassurance to those who understand its message. It all depends on which side of the fence you happen to be on, the side of the Lord, or the side of the world.This book is a call of repentance from one of the LDS Church Prophets. It is a well timed message for our day and age. Even if you are not of the Mormon faith, its basic principals are soundly Christian. It encourages repentance, forgiveness and self-control.Who among us doesn't need repentance, forgiveness or self control?The teachings are very conservative in comparison to the modern day accepted morality, but then I don't remember the Lord putting a time limit on the Commandments, nor does it say, don't do this, unless you have a good reason to."
1,Shaming the victim,"It is unfortunate that this book is still in print. From the book itself:""Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.""In the book, Kimball also sees ""disobedience to husbands,"" masturbation, and homosexuality on equal par with murder."
1,This book made my life worse not better,"I'm told that this book have been revised after President Kimball died and that several of the more damaging ideas have been removed. I read the original version when I was 21. Rather than helping me progress on my path to godhood, this book had the opposite effect on me. Time and experience has helped me see this book in a different light. I believe this book is more about guilt and scare tactics than wound healing. I've heard the analogy that sin is like a cliff and forgiveness is a hospital at the bottom of the cliff. This book isn't a hospital. This book is a sign screaming about the dangers of the cliff and reiterates in so many ways that no one can survive the cliff or if they do they will never be the same again. The message is that life experiences will forever leave you bruised, damaged, and weak."
5,A must read,"If you are having struggles in life, this is a must read book. Ir really touches on a lot of great things"
1,Worst guilt trip book written,"Reading this book at the request of my bishop was a huge mistake.Bigfoot is Cain, son of Adam and Eve. A women better fight to her death if sexually assualted or she has sinned. Dictating sexual relations between spouses.I would suggest reading ""God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"" by Christopher Hitchens. It sheds light on religious guilt trips used by the majority of cults and religions. Chapter 11 puts the Mormons religion in perspective.If your pompous Mormon leader suggests this book to you do yourself a favor and pass."
1,ZERO stars? Is that possible?,"I'd have thunk that LDS, Inc. would have taken this book OUT OF CIRCULATION (buying ALL available copies & BURNDT THEM!) a long, long time ago...SWK was 'on a tear' about sexual sins, it's hardly about God's/Christ's Forgiveness At All.For example, he tells us that masturbation leads to (GASP) homosexuality!I believe he says that homosexuals are about 1% of the population, links the slightest sexual acts to beastiality, etc.Better Title: God's LDS HOUSE OF SHAME."
1,Dangerous nonsense.,"When you consider that this book tells doting Mormons that masturbation eventually leads to bestiality, is it any wonder male youth suicide is so rampant in societies heavily populated by Mormons?This book is valuable in that the more copies that are sold, the less easy it will be for the Mormon church to deny such absurdities were ever written (they are inclined to do) by a so-called ""inspired Prophet of God"".Buy this book and keep it for future reference. I'm sure LDS authorities would love to see it out of print."
3,"Errr.....Well, um.....it's interresting","If you like chilling, witchey, and erie sounding chants you'll love this CD!As far as the technical quality of this recording, I can't say much. It sounds as if she is in a metal echo chaimber for much of this cd. As far as the accompanying sounds....can't say it's much there either. It sounds like something you'd hear on bad sci-fi.However, to give credit where it is due, this is a decent way to start to learn galdr if you don't have an experienced teacher. I wish there were other recordings of Galdr avalible on the market. You may want to check out other chant recordings of the eddas avalible."
3,Authentic,"This is a strange CD, containing various tracks of chants to Odin using the runes of the Elder Futhark. Most of the runes are presented in a series of individual chants, ""The first one thou taught me ..."" but it's a little hard to understand what's being said. Knowing the names of the runes makes it much easier to get it. Other tracks cover other sections of Northern mythology such as post-Ragnorak times. I bought this CD with her book, and after perusing the book I appreciated the CD much more than I did at first. She seems to be a real scholar of the runes and I'm glad to have this genuine authentic material, even though at first it's a little less approachable than the popularized rune books like Blum's. I would recommend this for a serious investigator of the power of runes. This CD is kind of haunting, almost eerie at first, but later powerful in a very elemental way."
4,"Good content, poor audio quality","I purchased this CD specifically to hear examples of rune-singing. If the singing was clearer, it would be a good example that I could learn rune-singing from.On my PC (cheap speakers and inexpensive on-board audio), echoes and other sound effects make it difficult to hear exactly what is being sung. Perhaps on a better sound system, they add richness to the audio; I'll investigate that possibility when I get the chance."
2,Close to Wicca,This is an ok book if you are Wicca-Tru or more of a universalist. The book has proven virtually useless in practicality.
2,Dreadful,"I have trouble keeping this CD on. The singing is dreadful. Her voice is horrible. It sounds like she is calling the devil. My kids leave when it is on. I can not recommend this CD, it's just not good."
5,The Great Duke Ellington,This picture sums up the life of Duke Ellington. I have been going back and forth in my mind about getting a picuture of Duke when he was younger but the wrinkles and bags under his eyes were earned by him
1,outdated,I returned this book after opening the cover and scanning the contents. If you are looking for help with computer based recording this is not it.
2,musician's home recording book,"I bought this book after hearing great things about it. It references older technology and has very few useful things in it. If you own a reel to reel tape machine, it will show you how to make splices. There is a brief mention of digital recording. The brief mention of it feels akin to reading an old earth science book from 1965. ""Someday, mankind may reach the moon"". I sure hope so."
5,Excellent book,"An excellent book for a musician in desperate need but with no possibility of going into a professional recording studio. All the basic controls are explained, the book deals with recording and post processing in an easy and understandable manner using graphs and photographs. A great book for those that want to produce good music from home, but if you want to get noticed and step away from your home recording studio you should also read ""How To Make A Fortune In The Music Industry By Doing It Yourself: Your Personal Step-By-Step Guide To Having A Successful Career In The Music Business. ... To Sell Music, Book Shows And Get Noticed!"" By Ty Cohen, a great book to get you started in the music business ."
1,Only Good as a Brain Puzzle,"Anybody who tells you this is a good way to learn Scheme (or recursion) wants to cause you pain. Don't believe their lies!Go learn the language (or how to use recursive techniques) somewhere else and come back to this once you have the basics if you want to get some practice thinking in the Scheme mindset.In my opinion, a better way to practice would be to simply write some tools in Scheme than to waste your time banging your head against the wall trying to divine what this waste of paper is trying to teach you."
1,A waste of time and money,This book has no place in a serious students library or anywhere else. It is poorly laid out with no logical sequence or progression from one idea to the next. There is never any detailed explanation just a bunch of disjoint sentences that read like a Dr Seuss or some comic book. When I am stuck I never seem to get answers here. If you want to learn scheme I suggest skipping this one.
1,TERRIBLE!,"This was, without a doubt, the worst book on learning a programming language that I have ever had the misfortune of encountering.It proceeded along tossing out tiny pieces of knowledge that were presented in an incredibly unhelpful way.Maybe some people think like this and ""Programmed Learning"" pedagogic theory (google it for more info) would work well for them, but it sure doesn't for me.The general experience of this book in the class I had it for was that it was fairly polarizing. Some really liked it, most cracked the cover only a few times and then looked for online resources, and some really hated it (like me)."
1,What a stupid way to write a programming book,"This book is nothing but a list of disjointed questions. Of course, my professor talks up and down about what a great way to learn this it. Which, like the book, is nothing but bologna. Definitely a book to sell back at the end of the semester. Professors beware: I have already decided how this course's instructor will be evaluated at the end of the semester, just by flipping through the book he selected at the campus book store before I even met him. After all, what idiot would make me buy a book like this?"
2,"Not for me, thanks","The music on this tape set is so annoying and bizarre that I can't stand to listen to it again. And it takes up a good portion of the tape.On the positive side, most of the dialogue seems fairly clear. The transcript appears reasonably complete. The packaging is attractive.Best of all this tape set helps to smash the myth of better learning through the addition of music."
4,Excellent Movie,Vidhu Vinod Chopra has created a very Hitchcockian thriller. I liked the idea that the whodunnit story takes place among a films cast and crew as they are shooting on location. Chopra's reference to films like 'The Godfather' and 'Psycho' were quite funny. 'Khamosh' isn't as much a thriller as there's a lot of humour.
2,"Cayce rocks, but this book is dated","Having completed my thesis on the function of sleep and dreaming, I have read extensively on the subject. While I tend to lean more toward physiological neuroscience perspectives on the functions of our dreams, I am very open-minded and believe that our dreams surely serve a psychological purpose as well. I picked up this book expecting something more than I got. I was presented with a poorly written and gender biased first chapter(for example, when talking of one of Cayce's clients ""She turned to the woman's world of family and relationships..."" Granted it was written several decades ago, but still...) Honestly, I'm avoiding finishing the book. I am sure Cayce himself was a very talented dream interpreter and helped many people but Harmon Bro does not do him justice here."
2,This book was a disappointment.,"I have enjoyed other Edgar Cayce books, however, this one left much to be desired. The information on dream interpretation was sketchy, when the author discussed Cayce's OWN dreams and the fact that they were ""submitted for interpretation"", he didn't indicate who interpreted them! In addition, most of the example cases used in the book just seemed to be heavily stuck on the Stock Market. I didn't buy this book for assistance in the Stock Market, and honestly, the information given in the book wasn't helpful anyway!"
4,Stan and Oliver,"Two things distinguish this CD - Oliver Nelson's charts and Turrentine's superb playing. Nelson was going through a great arranging period at this time, doing marvelous things with his big band. The excellent albums he made with Jimmy Smith come to mind immediately while listening to this CD, and one tune in particular (GRAVY TRAIN) has a very strong flavor of a Smith-Nelson monster hit. Nelson is an excellent colorist in his charts: LITTLE SHERI makes interesting use of flutes and MATTIE T. features the brass section nicely. Stanley is the chief soloist on all the tracks, and he really shines on the gutsy RIVER'S INVITATION. A TASTE OF HONEY is an up-tempo waltz, one of the better versions of this song I know. Herbie Hancock has a compelling solo on the blues A KETTLE OF FISH. It's nice to have this album around again."
4,Mattie T. swings like hell!,What a combination Stanley Turrentine with the famous Oliver Nelson (Jimmy Smith- Bashin') Band.Mattie T. is the highlight of this session. The band swings like a fire ball!You gotta hear this beauty!
3,Big Band Stan,Modern big band music...you have to wonder what it would have sounded like without the ON Orchestra and over production. Did this stuff ever sell. Think CASINO ROYALE soundtrack without the hooks or Dusty Springfield. BN should have RVG'd LOOK OUT instead of this one. I am not a fan of big band jazz or over produced jazz like some of the Verve and all of the CTI stuff from mid 60's to early 70's. Listen to the sound samples here before you buy. Having said that Oliver Nelson's Blues and the Abstract Truth and More Blues and Abstract Truth are essential jazz listening as well as the Gil Evans stuff. This is just way over produced/charted. Stanley T is still GREAT!
3,So slow -then so fast,"Ok, when this guy starts you think we are never going to get to play the harp here. He spends forever on tuning and talking up the harp. Then all of the sudden he is playing songs this way and that. You are supposed to play along, but there is no bouncing ball telling you what notes to play. Then he starts singing, which is not that great, so you are thinking what the heck is going on here."
2,Not for beginners,"I did not think this DVD was helpful for a novice autoharp player. Yes, it was very detailed in showing how to tune the autoharp, but it did not explain well how to play. It also progressed much too rapidly. It needs to have more basic how-tos added. It also assumes that you know chords, chord progressions, etc. I must confess I was disappointed."
4,TBS are Amazing,"I was recommended this CD by Amazon.com because of other albums I have bought through them. I was a bit skeptical, I'll admit, since usually nobody can pick a good CD for me. I trucked down to the local music store and listened to it there. It was a beautiful piece of work. I have always enjoyed Belle&Sebastian, and this CD definitely has a B&S-esque feel for it. There are one or two songs that don't strike me very well, but other than that, this is a great album and I suggest it to anyone that enjoys the melancholic music scene."
3,broken by whispers,"It simply allows me to be ""blue"" and ""vulnerable"" to hear some of the songs. Sometimes the tempo is slow but I like how it delivers a unique experience of subtleness of a dreamland.Bob's vocal is very nice."
1,ur so fragile,"boring music for boring people. typical... copy of a copy of copies copied from copies. We all know the story... I'm sure they felt good making this music, but failed to realize they are concocting a college campus. Just looking at the song titles anyone should be able to realize the lack of creativity in this collective. i do not have nerves of steal. if you think this music is emotional, you need to be compacted into lampshades.*note: apply this review to your cd collection"
1,Not sure why all the fuss,"This was recommended to me by Amazon because of other CDs I have purchased or my buying patterns. I found that the recommendation was poor and this CD offers no musical, vocal, lyrical, or pleasurable value. Even after a couple of listens it doesn't grow on me. I much prefer the other CDs that this CD is consider to be among."
4,One of the best bands I've never heard,"I can't believe this album was released 5 years ago, but I only just recently heard it for the first time. Literally, TBS drew me in the moment the first song started.Overall, their stuff is quiet, thoughtful, sparse (without neglecting melody) and melancholy. In many ways I think it's a great testament to a group when I find it difficult to describe them, yet easy to describe how they made me feel."
4,Big Halloween ideas in a small package,"This isn't a large book about Halloween, but it's fun. Though this book is mostly geared toward children, I've found it to be a good source of ideas for adult parties as well. It has some wonderful treats recipes using pumpkin that I have made to rave reviews, and I particularly love the sections on ""costume party themes,"" Halloween outing ideas, and fortune-telling games. With only line illustrations and no photos, it isn't a flashy book, and some of it's suggestions are a little cliche, but it is so jam-packed with good ideas that I hate to see the Halloween Book fall out of print. Grab it where you can!"
5,Great Filters,I put 2 of them in my Dodge Viper and could hear and feel the difference compared to the factory ones.
3,Item not as pictured on Amazon's ad,"A lovely pattern by Lenox, however, unless you are very familiar with Winter Greetings, please note that the Winter Greetings china butter plate does not have birds on it and instead only has greenery. Please contact Amazon before ordering this product to make sure you're getting what you need."
2,DRIVE_IN MOVIE CLASSICS,I like the movies but I didn't like the mill creek entertainment logo that comes up 3 or 4 times on the screen when your watching a movie.I own all the 50 packs and no other pack has this annoying logo that comes up except this one and DARK CRIMES.IF i had knew this i would have never bought these two.If you don't mind logo coming up 3 or 4 times on the screen when your watching a movie then buy this.
2,Good Titles - Poor Quality,"Some great B grade to Z grade movies that are often hard to find, so if the movie you're looking for is in this collection then be warned that the quality of the source (old video)is no match for any reasonable expectations.Example: The Invasion of the Bee Girls is still much clearer on my 30 year old video copy than it is on the DVD version.The B/W ones are reasonably clear and I prefer to watch these than the washed out -no contrast - over saturated colour versions.Millcreek (the production company) seem to have done little to fix up the source stock, or maybe the source stock was incapable of being fixed.Too bad! If you are desperate for the titles then I recommend that you buy this collection, otherwise try and find it yourself as an original."
3,"Good, but too gory in places.","Once again, Mill Creek presents a fun box set of 50 movies, but 4 or five of them were very gory."
4,worth it!,"i bought this item because one title sprang out at me which was absolution starring richard burton, a movie i've been wanting to see for ages now. i almost bought it on it's own from amazon which would have costed me $13.99 ++ shipping costs but buying this pack costed me $12.99++. the movie itself is still in good condition as it's only about 30 years old so i considered this purchase as extremely good and i got the other 49 movies as a bonus, so i,ll have an enjoyable time wading through them."
3,50 Movies (almost),"I originally bought this dvd set for one movie that is not available anywhere else on dvd. That movie was ""Spare parts"". Out of 50 movies 49 of them played just fine. I'll bet you can't guess which one didn't play. That's right, Spare parts."
3,Laughs For Days...Most Unintentional,"First of all, you can't beat the price, but if you're a stickler for quality videos (some of these aren't so good), then you might want to purchase these films separately. Some are quite action-packed and take you back to a more innocent time, when drive-in movies were all over the country. (There were once more than 3000, now there are les than 300).A lot of memories (my teenage kids crack up at some of the slang used ""back then""), but a pretty good amount of bang for your buck--especially if you like camp and over-the-top acting. You also get a chance to see some famous actors of today in their embryonic stage.There is some nudity. ""Bee Girls"" in itself is a hoot and a half, as is ""Jive Turkey."" If you like a good buzz, this fills the bill."
2,they put way to many of the same movies on this set,"i own many of these 50 movie packs and i really like most of them. so,and i know i was dumd for not looking for a list of the movies in the pack, i bought this one with no worries. after i got here i found at least 30 to 35 of these movies are on some of my other collection i bought.so my 2 is for the movies that i didn't have,and if you have never bought one of these before you may like it better than me,but be warned the transfers on this set are poor even by this company's standerds."
3,Cheesiest of the 5 sets I have,"Of the five 50-pack sets I have, this one seems to me to be the cheesiest overall. But then, I rather expected this given that it's a set of ""drive-in"" Grade B/C ""classics."" I really did not recognize many of the names and, unlike one other reviewer, though I have other sets, there did not seem to be duplicates here. (I have Suspense, Chills, Mystery and Horror besides this one.)"
1,WARNING,Another 50 pack that is sometimes sent with different movies on itI got this one with no outside cover no Ceepers and no saticfation
1,"Not worth it, save your money.","They should call this ""50 Movies no one watched"" These were horrible and a waste of money. Anyone want to buy mine from me?"
2,Drive in Movie Classics,I've found only a few of the movies that I actually liked. Some of the movies are of poor quality and really bad plots--I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Complete crap,"I jumped quickly through half the movies and threw the whole collection into the trash. Not campy, not funny, not sexy, not interesting in any way. One star for the reusable 13 disk package."
2,Quality in the toilet,"I've bought a couple of Mill Creek's 50 packs in the past. I thought I knew what to expect: quantity over quality but tolerable enough to be enjoyable. What the Drive In pack contains is horrendous quality, pan and scan formats, and heavily edited versions. If that weren't bad enough a Mill Creek logo pops up on screen frequently. I quit watching TV because I got so tired of them putting crap over the picture, now I have to put up with that in DVD's I buy? I don't care if it is cheap. If I want to know the name of the company I can look at the freakin' box! Who thought that logo was a good idea and why have they not yet been committed to the asylum?Still, I have found some of the movies in the set to be entertaining, movies that I wouldn't have seen if not for getting this set so I won't give it the lowest possible rating.If you're looking for a movie that's in this set and it's available somewhere else, go for the other version."
2,waste,I didn't realise how awful these movies were - when I think we used to really look forward to seeing these stinkers at the show - guess our senses have matured
3,Piece of Junk,It should be noted that this emachines was released 1/19/2006. As such it is not the emachines that the individual noted in the other review that broke after 1year and a half.From What I have read - this machine is highly recommended.
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I purchased this emachines through Best Buy 1 1/2 yrs ago. I have had many computers in my lifetime and this one has been the most disappointing to me. The motherboard shorted out/blew the other day and now I am left with a piece of junk. After talking to many people I work with, I find out I am not the only one with issues exactly as this one. Now I am completely out of luck and the $500 I spent! I will never purchase an emachines again! Yesterday, I ordered a Dell, let's see how that one behaves!Luckily, customer service is nice, but they didn't fix this computer!"
5,I LOVE HER.,"IT'S ALL ABOUT INTENSITY. SHE SINGS FROM HER STOMACH, AND FROM HER HEART. I AM GLAD THAT SHE ENTERTAINS AND WRITES, AS SHE SAYS, ""GOOD POP MUSIC"", AMEN."
4,OUCH! I MY EARS HURT!,"Homogenic contains some of the most bombastic and the most melodic songs by Bjork I've ever heard. Personally I think the best songs on this CD are ""Joga"", ""Unravel"", ""All Neon Like"", ""5 Years"" (I just love the infectious bassline, the lyrics and that stomping sound that creeps up from a distance and continues to stomp to the end), ""Immature"" and ""Alarm call"". I think that Bachellarette is a weak ballad that is long and overdrawn. At first a liked ""Pluto"" but now that rattle-rattle-bragadang machine sound effects and Bjork's disgustingly uneven howls and scream near the end of the song is annoying and I can't stand it. Purchase at your own risk but don't expect another Bjork: Post (which I prefer). Most of the songs are lyrically enchanting and melodic. Who knows, you may even appreciate ""Pluto"" more than I do. Just don't explode like Bjork does. Bzzzzzzzzz...Rattle-Rattle... Bragadakk...Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!"
5,**Pluto** Rocks!!!!!!!!!,"Whatever they may say, I must tell you that the track called *Pluto* is very wonderful. It is the fastest song on the album, but if you think you can handle it go for it. I recomand playing it over and over 3x daily as a healty regement to a happy life. For the song is about that moment when everything has built up to the point where you'er going to expolde, and don't we all feel like that sometimes... well, I guess not all of us, christina."
5,Pure Bliss,"This review won't be me just gushing on how great Bjork is, and how she changed my life, and all of that crap. I just love this cd, pure and simple. The music is haunting and only gets better with each listen, that is what I buy a cd for, longevity, this album definitely has it. From the opener ""Hunter"" to the closer ""All is Full of Love"", the mammoth vocal talent that is Bjork struts her stuff, not yielding to mainstream, and just making great music. Just buy it and listen to the whole thing straight through, it will change your life, just kidding."
4,Neat stuff,"This CD ends up in fairly heavy rotation whenever I'm doing research, writing a paper or cleaning the kitchen. Even the slow songs move forward with a methodical pace that would shame Baum's Clockwork Man.Favourite tracks are Joga, Alarm Call and Pluto. All three have their special charms, but most particularly I dig the beats on Joga, the lyrics on Alarm Call and the electronic effects on Pluto.This album doesn't rate a five simply because there's no song that combines all these elements perfectly. Still, a really good album, I recommend it highly."
5,This may be my all time favorite album. And I own many.,"So many musicians can change lives. When I look back at the time of release of this album it just had longevity oozing out the speakers. And yep. About 15 years later it still sounds oh so good. This is my kind of album. Haunting, free thinking, and flows like honey. One smoking track one after another. I Think this may have been the pinnacle of her career and she still has the potential of making an album just as well if not better. Oddly enough from a guy's perspective. This album really helped me get over a first love experience in high school. I listened to it over and over again with a crushed heart. And it healed me in time quite a lot. Maybe for that reason alone sure I will admit. This is probably my favorite album that I have yet heard and ever heard in my life. A thank you note to Bjork and affiliates. Tune upwards. Tune onwards. Peace."
3,An acquired taste,"Giving this record 5 stars is a little too over-rated, IMHO. I waited a whole month before giving it another listen and still can't get into some of the songs. Bjork has a great voice, but a song like Pluto makes me scramble for Chopin as an antidote. If you think Tori Amos is weird, wait till you hear Bjork! Her blood-curdling screams are probably annoying to people who are more subdued.Great songs like Bachelorette, Joga and All Neon Like kept me from throwing this one in the garbage can. There is a kind of East European.Oriental feel to the music, especially with the string arrangments. Although Tori Amos borrowed a little from Bjork on her To Venus And Back, I think both women are unique in their own ways. E.g. Bjork doesn't have the depth of Tori, or her pianistic talent.Anyway you have to find the right mood to listen to this one, because on some days the techno noise can really drive you up the wall. Oh, and ignore the tacky photo on the cover."
2,Alarm call!,"I even have a limited edition digipak of this album, but I am really unhappy with it. After ""Post"" (one of the most important albums of the '90s), my expectations probably were too high, but I think ""Homogenic"" is one of Bjork's worst efforts. This arty project collapses in a heap of extravaganzas, pretentions, and lax song ideas. Despite the participation of Mark Bell (he once was a member of a groundbreaking British techno duo called LFO, releasing two innovative albums, ""Frequencies"" and ""Advance""), it's unbelievable how plastic und ugly the techno beats sound. The orchestral arrangements are sometimes very whiny, and besides, this album completely lacks the sonic diversity of ""Post"". It's just one big mush of uninspired techno beats, affected vocals, and lame neoclassical tendencies. Even the remix collection ""Telegram"" was better. There's only one really good song here: ""Joga"", and its accompanying video clip is fantastic. Apart from this song, ""Homogenic"" is a waste of time."
2,sorry to burst your bubble,"the lyrics are relatively below grade, compared to bjorks other efforts. the beats sound like a certain locust album, but not as inspired. she could have worked with any arranger/composer -- i found the strings to be tepid. she might as well hired gary numan to play an early 80s keyboard. and even though bjork has a very expressive voice. she seems to have stagnated vocally. which is dissapointing."
2,Thumbs down,"With the exception of Joga, I really can't say I like this album. I loved Post, debut and even a few of the barmy songs she did with Sugarcubes, but Homogenic downright makes me cringe.To sum up: Bjork, you've got a terriffic voice. Let someone else do the song-writing!"
2,pass,"i am bjorks biggest fan.i have every import mini bjork bootleg promo cd in the universe. i have a bjork web page, my own bjork secret stalker fan club. my girl friend looks like bjork, and i have legally changed my name to bjork. its on my drivers license. i plan on having many many children and naming them all bjork.however, i have one regret.if i could do it all over again, i would not buy this cd. i would spend the money on plastic surgery so that i could look like bjork. i would then kidnap myself and collect the ransom money from the record label. and then i would hijjack a plane and crash into the statue of liberty... i would buy a used copy of the cd with the left over money. only 2 or 3 songs are decent."
5,Music that makes you THINK.,"Homogenic is NOT your everyday album. The sounds, the textures, the beats and noises are all unique unto themselves. This album is very BJORK. Therefore, it is unusual, ahead of its time, and just plain amazing."
5,Absolutely essential for even the most casual Bjork fan,"Bjork's personal turmoil at this point in her life shines through on this stripped down album. All ten songs are basically techno mixed with strings. No other musician has ever made pain sound so good. This album is essential for the most casual fan of Bjork, Madonna, The Cure, Weezer, or Evanescence."
5,Bjork's Masterpiece,"Homogenic opens with a frightening soundscape that will lure the listener into this dark and isolated world right away. Abrasive electronic beats mesh perfectly with the angelic strings and it makes for quite a combination. A true treat to Bjork fans and music fans alike. This is an album of pure genius from one of the most genius artists currently making music. It will grab you and refuse to let the listener go even after the album is through. A masterpiece from the cosmos is ""Homogenic"""
5,One of the Most Important Albums of the 90's,"I have been a Bjork fan for more than 5 years, and after hearing Homogenic fro the first time, there was no way to expect the emotional and musical reprecussions of this incredible recording. The tension created between the strings and beats in virtually every song on the album make every cell in your body squirm in a mixture of ecstacy and dread. Bjork has outdone herself here. Every song exemplifies her enormous capacity to put hardcore emotions to words. Every person claiming to be an audiophile must own this album for themselves."
5,The best CD I ever purchased!,This has to be the best purchase I ever made. This is one of those CD's that I will wear out because of overplay. I can't get over how amazing and refreshingly new Bjork's music is. Listen for yourself and you can purchase with confidence on this album.
4,Yum,"Gotta say guys, I love Pluto! When it comes on I start to sway, my eyes close, my grin spreads - there's just so much power and enthusiasm and impatience there! I was initially disappointed with Homogenic, I was hoping for an album as evolutionary/revolutionary as Post had been and this wasn't it - but oh my, did it ever grow on me and now it's one of those cds that spontaneously pops into your head and forces you to drop what you're doing and run home and crank it up to listen entranced for an hour! Very Bjork!"
5,A Masterpiece,"This is undoubtedly the best purchase I've ever made. Bjork has been my favorite artist for a few years now and I'm very familiar with her music, this is the best. It's a testament to her brilliance. Believe it or not, when I first bought this album, I didn't like it all that much, but one day I was listening to it leisurely, when all of a sudden All if Full of Love came on, and I started listening, and it turned into the most beautiful piece of music I had ever heard. I then listened to the album over and over again. As I was listening, I realized that Bjork is such a genius. She's so there and I'm so greatful to her for making music and lending her fantastic voice to my life."
5,In her own genre.,I couldn't help but fall in love with Bjork after hearing this album. The lush orchestral strings are painfully beautiful while the weird electronic beats in the background make it seem as if her songs are on the verge of complete dissonance. But Bjork makes it work; no other artist even comes close to creating the stunning blend of rich classical sounds with the underground beats of electronica. Bjork has created her own genre.
5,WOW,"I am a brand-new Bjork fan. The first album I bought was Greatest Hits and now I am working on getting all the others. I got Homogenic just yesterday, and already I can't stop listening to it! This album is AMAZING, i LOVE it! Not a sinlge throw-away song on here. The marriage of techno and orchestration Bjork creates is absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to hear Post!"
5,A+++++++,Perfect! Every song speaks to my soul! As an avid Bjork fan I must say she has not let me down. Unlike Debut and Post you have to let this one grow on you. A few listens and you will be hooked. Also check out her singles they are all great. She is taking music to a new level.
5,Bjork at it again,"Bjork is one artist whose albums are always anticipated with bated breathe and more often than not, they don't disappoint but thrill instead. The latest Homogenic contains such visionary and futuristic ditties like Hunter, Joga, Bachorette and All Is Full Of Love. and of course the complementary visuals of her fantatsic videos. EXCELLENT! One glitch though, Bjork is probably one of the least recognised talent around, acieving very little success in the US than many untalented artists out there. But in Iceland, UK and Europe, she is in high demand!"
5,I can die happy!!,"Homogenic has made my life complete. There was something lacking and I couldn't fill the void. But after purchasing Homogenic, that void was immediately filled with a new genre of music which only Bjork can create. I can truly die content and happy now."
4,Prince of the house,"The ever so mysterious Romanthony (in the last five years he has given two interviews - by phone) delivers a grand album, following numerous releases on vinyl. Joint released by his own label Blackmale and Glasgow Underground, R. Hide in Plain Site is like the house gospel tribute to the great Prince, Romanthony's big inspiration. The album is met with high expectations, but doesn't disappoint. Sweet and low, joy is all when the R makes his moves. Bliss."
4,"Thuper, super awesome","I agree. They rock. Solid message, great instrumental (cap)abilites (is that what they're called?), and humorous lyrics. An awesome album, definitely worth listening to, it's a good example of great Christian music. My favorite song is probably the Vitamin Song. So, for those of you who have heard OF ASU and got the impression that they are a soccer team or something... check out the album!"
3,Not as good as I thought It'd be.,I was a little disappointed with this cd considering all the hype and stuff I heard. It's different sounding (it might just not be my style). Some of the songs had potential but probably could've been better musicalistically. I did like Savior of My Universe however. Maybe I just need to listen to it some more before it grows on me.
5,All Star rocks my socks fer sure!,"I've had this CD for quite some time now and I must say that it's gotten a lot of play in my CD player. Excellent driving music! Clever lyrics! All Star United just rocks! (btw: check out International Anthems For The Human Race, their new CD) One last thing: Jesus, come and save us 'cause we're lost in space."
1,Rubbish,"I heard this gentleman do a presentation which was filled with a plethora of logical fallacies, sheer nonsense, and laughable logic. This book merely dumbs down dumb ideas to something a kindergartener would find ridiculous. Evolution does not preclude a belief in God, and ""Dr."" McMurtry (if you research, he received his ""Doctorate of Divinity""--usually an honorary degree--from an unaccredited Bible College) seems to want everyone to believe that you are either a Bible-fearing believer or an atheist. A typical either/or fallacy and pure rubbish. Don't waste your time with this pseudo-scientific hack."
3,"You want good cheerful music, buy this one!","The music is upbeat, the words are uplifting, you'll go away feeling alot better than before you heard it! MWS continues to write songs that relate to young people, like ""Somebody Love Me"", which gives hope knowing you are not the only one needing to be loved. Though the music is encouraging and makes you feel good, I wish there would be more of a focus on Christ. However any Christian can still be ministered to and uplifted my MWS's positive words and music! This one needs to be in your tape deck!!"
2,Illustrations are illegible on a black and white Kindle,"I wanted to save weight on my hike to Phantom ranch so I bought this guide for my Kindle. Don't bother. Field guides need illustrations. This edition is a cheesy digitization of the dead-tree book filled with illustrations which were originally a) much larger; and b) printed in color. On my 7"" b/w kindle, they were near useless."
5,These work great,"These are easy to put onto the cable before stripping and installing the end. It gives them a more professional look. The only problem, I forget to put them on sometimes. I probably have 4 cables with this boot missing from one end. Of course, no star deduction for user incompetence."
3,Cat 5e White Strain Relief Boot,"Ordered these RJ45 strain relief boots. Items were received promptly. I would rate these items as just ok. The boot diameter was a little too large for the Cat5e cable I was using. The cable diameter I was using was rather small (about 3/16""). Some Cat5e cable diameters run larger; so for me the boots ended up slipping away from the RJ45 connector. Also, it should be noted that one does not really need these boots. I do not think they provide any strain relief. They are used for cosmetic reasons only. Nice look if the cables are in an area that is visible."
3,Not recommended for frequently connected/disconnected cables,"First time I've used boots. They look nice, but seem to partially depress the ""release tab"". Takes extra care to ensure the jack is locked into place. I wouldn't use them on a jack I expected to connect/disconnect frequently."
3,RJ45 relief Boots,"Item used for surveillance system and it works like it was made to do, would recommend this product to anyone needing added hardware to their system."
4,"Does exactly what it is supposed to, and does it well.","The price is right, the quality is spot on. Great for color coding your cables, and protecting the RJ45 ends. These things are quality enough I wouldn't have any problems using them in customer installations."
1,Many problems with this book.,"I have been working with this book for over a month and have not been able to get beyond Ch.2 because the instructions in the book simply do not work. ORA-ERROR!!! This book needs to be tried and tested by random students across the country before releasing to the general public. There is no-one responding to the ""Bulletin Board"" questions the student's pose and no interaction with the professors or any instructors. Why do they call this book ""Interactive?"" It is time consuming and highly frustrating. Find another do it yourself book or CTB... I hope the author's really improve on the 2nd edition, with better web support!"
1,Bad Web Access (Don't buy this book),"This book is good for beginners with all the information from the publisher web site (www.....com). The down side for this book is, there is not cd-rom & all the script & examples in the book needed to download from the (www.....com). The web services provide by the phptr is really bad. I have been unable to access the web for more than few days(Until Now!!). I advice to all the oracle beginner look for other¡s book. Cause without the access to the web site (www.....com) a lot of examples can¡t work. Don¡t¡ waste ur money & time for something can¡t work 100% for U. (not even 80% - This include almost all the interactive series from phptr)"
1,:),i love chill lofi music and this selection is just not up to the challenge. imho every one has their own taste so pls listen to all the samples before purchase.
1,Global communication?????????,"If i could give it no stars i would I listened to this with enthusiam.when I heard global communication's ""tremble"" i absolutely fell in love with the song and the artist. Its still one of my top ten favorites. so i got this mix comp just specifically because it was glibal communication. Ive never heard such garbage this is horrible i expected beautiful melodic music that would send me to another place. I listened to the entire thing with hopes that there would be something good but no luck. Last few tracks are decent except the very last one. tom middleton screwed up as well. well avoid this mix unless you want to be dissappointed anyone who does like this is tone deaf"
2,Not what I thought.,"I should have read the discription of this CD better than what I did, before I bought it. I absolutely LOVE GC, and was assuming (my bad) that this was going to be like, or more like, 76:14 or Pentamerous Metamorphosis, so I rushed to order it. What the CD is, is a mix or other artists doing funk/jazz/rap/street beats, and in my opinion, not all that great. Sorry Mark and Tom, but this was a bit of a shortfall. Next time, I'll read the entire discription of the album before I just presume."
5,brilliant,"I couldn't believe the new student. I thought for sure that BRITT was gone for good, but when it came time for things to happen you really can't tell a book by its cover. CONGRESS should do more reading and a lot less gabbing..."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this frame along with another by the same company that has a darker frame and gold highlights. When I received this frame in the mail, it had 2 cracks in the frame on diagonal corners. Paint was quite glossy, not what I was expecting. The paint finish made the product appear cheap rather than classy. The other frame (which I also reviewed as poor quality, shipped damage) was in worse condition, and more expensive. As I recommended on the other product, don't waste your money on this frame, and instead look for something of much nicer quality if you plan to frame something nice."
5,Truly a very catching ending!,"I have to tell you, as an avid fan of Charlotte Valen Allens', I milked this book the whole way - not wanting it to end, as I do all of her books, but the ending to this book was not even what you think would happen. I think that is what makes Ms. Vale Allen's books so much of a ""must"" for me. Where she comes up with the surprise endings is beyond me. I think that is why I'm always awaiting her next book after I finish one - one never knows what she has in store us. Charlotte Vale Allen's books do not come fast enough!"
1,shallow literature,"I just finished reading ""Grace Notes"" and regret wasting my time. What an inane story with the most unbelievable characters. The dialogue was trite and repetitive. How many times do we have to hear the characters telling each other how much they love each other?(all that gooey sentiment -yuck) I have teenage sons and a daughter and we do not talk to each other like that! Rather than have the reader learn about the characters through action and decisions, she keeps giving us laundry lists of all of their qualities, ad nauseum. She didn't flesh out the characters, she just kept telling us about them. The reader never learns anything new about the main characters from page one until the last page (except for Stephanie). If this book is like any of the authors other books, than count me out as a future reader of Vale Allen."
5,An Enigma of Delight,"Imagine yourself in a labyrinth where every exit is an entrance. A place that you can never realy leave because just as you think you can you find another wonder to explore which you may have explored already. That is what Pavic has created in this truly delightful enigma. One is tempted to make comparisons with Swift, Carroll or Kafka but one can safely say that Pavic in this book stands by himself. A grand book that has managed to never end nor ever begin!"
1,No Substance And Little Style,"An unreadable gimmick. Has little to do with the Kingdom of Khazar, a nation in Medieval Russia in which the entire population converted to Judaism. The fact that the authors needed to include a stunt such as releasing ""male and female"" versions of the book (in which the difference lies in one single word being changed in the editions) should say a lot about the substance of this work."
1,Studies in tedium.,"I've had this book for thirteen years.I have tried to read it three times.Everytime I felt like chucking the boring thing at somebody.Unless you have read every single book out there and are a completist, skip this one."
3,Where was the sound Engineer?,"Even a hard core Chicago fan like myself has to sadly admit that this is not a great video. The band performed flawlesly (exept a couple out of pitch notes by the brass), and I think the interviews were great, not even Lee missing as a trumptet player bothered me. Why then I say is not a great video? Because the sound mix stinks! I dont know who mixed the audio for this video, but Chicago colud ask for their money back. Odly balanced vocals and poorly mixed music takes all the magic away. If I were to have it my way, I'll take the interviews and the cool edit they made on ""Does Anybody Really Knows What Time It Is?"" and transfer it to the Chicago At The Greek Theatre video where the sound mixing was very well done. And thats all I have to say about that."
1,Which band?,"Yes, the band played on, but with 4 members of the 8 not there, and most of the music that made Chicago, replaced with love ballad after love ballad mush, what's the reason to call this Chicago? Yes, it's a perfectly good band playing good average AOR, but unless you are very young and joined them after the first 11 albums, you'll know that the original band DID NOT play on. This is just survival stuff, and good for them too. May they always play and make a living, as I love them dearly. But Chicago-music compared to its best? To remember what they are capable of, and watch what they actually have become now, is very sad. To gloss over everything with a blanket praise of everything good and bad, will neither serve the audience, nor the band themselves who could do with some realistic feedback. So yeh, if you have never seen them, this is worth a look, but if you remember what they set out to be, then forget this."
2,terrible b-ball simulation,"the control itself sucks - passing is akward, shots look weird, players don't move like they do in real life when setting up a play...graphics are disappointing as well...i liked nba live 05 better than this game...it seems to be choppy and doesn't flow like a bball game should"
4,Pretty Good,"NBA Live is a great game for basketball lovers, but not PS2 sports fanatics. It lacks the play-as-a-superstar in first person aspect of Madden and MLB the show, but still provides a good dynasty mode. I am dissapointed though, even now they still don't have the supertstar. The game would fly off the shelves."
3,It was OK,"The game play felt forced for lack of a better word the movements didn't feel smooth and in certain situations they were even a bit jerky, instead of the usual slow forced action. but once you get used to it (and change the default gameplay settings) it is a very nice game."
3,NBA Live 08 is ok,I've played this game for a few weeks now so obviously I'm still deciphering some of the nuances of the game. It's not bad. I thought the graphics would have been much improved. I had the ESPN game a while back and I would say that the graphics on NBA Live 08 are just slightly better.Other than that the game seems to flow pretty well. It's not too difficult to pick up on. I didn't read any directions or anything. just turned it on and started playing. It's pretty intuitive.
4,"Decent, but sometimes disjointed","Jeffrey A. Brown's work is important, however his conclusions are perhaps a little overblown. His impression on how important Milestone was to both comic fans and in its influence is a little overstated. Milestone, upon the date of this work's publication, had been defunct for several years. While it's been about six months since I last looked at Brown's work, I don't believe he mentions this fact once. His last chapter on gender is important but doesn't necessarily fit as neatly into the work as I would like. However, the work in this chapter is very good. Perhaps it would have been better served as an article or the basis for another book."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book, but was let down. The book is an academic work and is a boring read. It does not provide any real insight into the forming of Milestone Media. The author relies on other sources instead of actual interviews with the founders of the company. The author draws many conclusions based on his visits to comic conventions, stores, and interviews with fans."
4,Great 80's Cd!,"This was Michaels 2nd release. Where the first album had a more aggressive sound this cd slowed it down a little bit. The songs that got my attention was ""End Of The Book"" and ""I Am Sure"" with their refreshing pop sound. I love the keyboard/synthesizer work on these songs and because of Smitty and other artist like him such as Leon Patillo made me want to venture into wanting to play keyboards and get into synthesizers in my younger years."
5,Excellent and truely overlooked,"I've been searching for this CD forever. I lost the tapes years ago and often thought of this album. What a great group of songs.Each song is so meaningful. If you like Michael W Smith,this is a must buy ...you will love it! So glad I found it after so many years."
5,An Old One but Good One,"This is one of Michael W. Smith's first albums, and well worth revisiting. I enjoyed listening to this one after not having had it in the collection for about 15 years. A must for any Michael W. Smith fan."
4,Great second album!,"Few artists have ever been able to span the test of time and generations, no matter what the genre. However, Michael W. Smith is definitely one of those rare artists whose albums, although 25 years old for this one, still reaches a new generation. Personally, I always thought the ones he wrote with his wife like ""Hosanna,"" on this one, were their best. What a songwriting team they make! I bought this when it was first released and still have it. MWS's ability to reach all ages, even today, just shows how much God can use a willing heart. Highly recommend!"
5,One of the BEST TRANCE CDS to date,I got into trance about 2 years ago and have been a die-hard since. Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport is what got me started and I thought that I would not ever hear a cd that comes close...until now. Trancematch puts two of the best trance dj's (Ferry Corsten and Armin Van Buuren) together for one of the greatest mix cds ever. The transitions are flawless. This has been in my cd player for months.
3,Good for first timers,"I would side with those that truly know trance in saying that this is not anything new. However the CD does have a lot of trance classics. If you are a first time listener I'd definitely recommend this CD since it is kind of a ""Best of"" album that will get you hooked on trance. It really deserves 4 stars, but in order to make sure veteran trance listeners aren't fooled by the scewed ratings, I had to try and bring the ratings down to what they should be.If you really like trance then you have to listen to Tiesto end of story. Summerbreeze is still one of my all time favorites. His recent CD In Search of Sunrise 3 is good as well. It's first 7 tracks are awesome. And if you are into High BPM trance then EVERYONE knows that DJ Dean's Tunnel Trance Force series is the best ever. Must be something in the water in Holland because great DJs spring up from there.Hope this helps.MP"
5,Trance UnMatched - even in 2005....,"Defintely the most addicting trance CD I've ever heard. If you're interested in trance and you want to make sure you'll like every track before you buy a trance cd, this is the one. With a few additions to songs like ""Touch Me"" which has a sweet female vocal, and Armin's own ""armix"" of Gouryella, you'll just want to repeat the cd. A perfect 10.UPDATE: I see some reviewers complaining about this CD. Obviously, they are new to trance, and have been suffering with the last few years of substandard trance. 1999-2000 still reigns as the best trance music year ever. Sorry, this IS the best trance CD ever."
1,Remarkable ear for idiom?,"Goldblatt's book is certainly ambitious, but in the end, its satirical nature fails to fully materialize. Unfortunately, AFRICA SPEAKS rehashes the same things that cultural critics have been saying for years, putting forth very few new ideas. However, Goldblatt's characters are perfect in consistency and crafted with care. Still, anyone who feels that AFRICA SPEAKS displays a ""remarkable ear for idiom"" has lived a very insular life.A valiant effort, nonetheless."
3,Interesting but lacks the spice of Black people,"If you haven't read this book, then i most say that this is quite an interesting book and because it is written by a white man, that doesn't mean that the voices of Africa (Africa Speaks) was not heard. I'll also recommend you if you have read this book or not, to read ""Africa Speaks - a continents' agony in poetic form"". This is also a book written by an African here in the U.S. It vividly tells the life of all Africans as carrried forward to this day, it can be found here on amazom. Coming back to this book, if you would like to hear the White man tales of Black poeple, then buy a copy."
1,Yeah! Black culture sucks!,"This is quite possibly the most shallow, one dimensional book I have ever read....this WHITE man seems so under the impression that he knows what black people think that he ends up making all his black characters unidimensional stereotypes and cardboard cutouts of real people. He has no concept of complex characters, and his satire comes off as forced and idealogically conservative. This book is essentially proposing a new white man's burden.[open sarcasm]I mean, its not THAT bad being black, is it?!?! [/end sarcasm]"
1,Satire is no excuse for racism,"This author has an overblown sense of his own insight. The use of satire as a literary technique is no excuse for creating ignorant, racist, and anti-human ""literature."" Please, do not be fooled by the ignorant ideas presented in this novel. The characters are nothing more than products of this author's racist fantasies. This is a dangerous book; it is a serious detriment to all genuinely thoughtful efforts to address America's racist legacy, and ongoing social conflicts."
3,I think it's Dolphy on bass clarinet,"Re: First review---according to the back cover of the cd, Dolphy plays alto sax, flute, and bass clarinet, and Coltrane just plays tenor & soprano sax. Also, Naima is the only tune that I've heard bass clarinet on, which I was very disappointed about."
5,Memory lane,"Loved this album when it came out on vinyl in the 1960's - so glad to see it on CD. I sent this to a dear friend who was dying of cancer, as a reminder of our glory days in the last 60's/early 70's, and he smiled through his pain. Great songs - versions not found anywhere else. Blondie at her best."
3,Difficult to similate,Rabi Remi Shapiro usually writes books that one can be encouraged by because the writing is so consise and flowing. I found this book difficult to follow. It might just be me. I would still recommend others to read it because it may be more clear for them.
4,A delightful skip and jump through Idaho history,"Stapilus collects the highlights of Idaho stories and presents them in readable vignettes. Some of the stories were familiar to me, after living here 27 years, but many were new, and delightful. How Idaho potatoes became famous, the first city electrified with nuclear power, the compact synopsis of ""Big Trouble"" in 3 pages, murderin' mountain man Claude Dallas' moment of infamy and more.Once it's done, you'll wish there were another layer of chocolates underneath the first one, or maybe that the book idea had been for 5 and 6-page versions of the stories rather than 2 and 3."
4,It Happened in Idaho,It was a quick read and told me of events in my home state that I never knew. I wish it would have included how the boundry of Idaho was formed. I am told that the boundry was formed by mistake. Now I'm curious. I gave the book as a present to my two brothers to enjoy as well.
3,Idahoan Review,Interesting stories about historical events in Idaho's history. I would recommend it to anyone interested in getting aquainted with the state and its past.
2,left me hanging...,"i found this record rather boring. i am a fan of electric wizard, sleep, et al and i bought this because it was on rise above records. i was disappointed. it seems that as more and more bands jump on the stoner doom rock band wagon, the more dull they become. this just doesn't have that spaced out evil desert vibe at all, if you know what i mean."
4,An essential reference,"This book is a terrific resource, even if you're not a budget. Wilson's book is chock-full of simple, creative ideas to make your home a stylish reflection of your personality, without spending a fortune. I've gotten many complements on my ""new furniture"" - which is really just my old furniture slipcovered with some inexpensive sheets following Wilson's easy instructions."
3,Not extraordinary,"I read this book because it was based in Manchester NH and Wells ME, two areas I know quite well. It was wonderful to read discriptions of places and be able to picture in my mind exactly the setting. The story line was not extraordinary, however. It seems a great deal of books I've read lately are about women who move on with life after their husbands walk out on them. This one also has a woman going in search of a lost love and how they rekindle old relationships. The best thing going for it was that it was short, so it was very quick. I wouldn't have wanted this book to go on much more than it did."
4,Maggie May's Diary,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I recently visited the location of this book's setting so it made it all more interesting and more personal to me to read.
3,Location Location Location,"I read this book one day while I was vacationing in Wells, Maine (one of the locals in the book). It was very enjoyable to read his discriptions of places and beaches that have been my second home for 18 years. I was intrigued to read on and see what other landmark he would choose to include. The book itself is just a tadd above a romance novel. My major complaint with the book is that Mr. Coughlin never made me like the main character, Maggie. She simply did not seem like a very nice person. I found myself almost wishing against her at times. All in all, a good first novel."
2,Not in wasp/yellow jacket territory!,"We got one of these when we bought our new home. It came with the house. We love it as do my boys (4 and 16 months) but unfortunately, the wasps love it too. The bright colours attract them and the gaps left where the pieces join together are apparently considered prime real estate for wasps to build their nests. I'm allergic to bees so I am in fear whenever we go in our backyard. I do a walk-around the structure every day, but between morning and nap there have been industrious wasps and so we can't play outside till my husband comes home and gets the nest down and sprays the living daylights out of the wasps or whatever these nasty things are. We are looking into getting either a metal structure or a wooden one...something not as bright and cheerful looking and something without all those little holes."
1,Disappointed,"I, as many others, bought this item at my local store for my son's first birthday. The birthday party was really the only time my son played on it. He enjoyed the big slide. Unfortunately, the small slide was broken when we bought it, and we have never received a replacement even though I have tried on several occasions to get one. We have also tried to reconfigure the tunnel and have been unsuccessful. I have encouraged him to play on it many times, but at two and a half he seems to have outgrown it and doesn't show much interest. We have other items by the same brand and are very happy with them. For the money we paid, I thought this would last us at least a few years. I am now looking for something else for my son to play on outside."
5,We love this toy!!!,"We got this toy from our local Toys R Us last year for our then 1 1/2 year old son. It is not as colorful as the picture on amazon.com/toysrus.com but thats ok. The other one is more ""hot"" colors and ours is more neutral. Also the other one seems a little girly to me... I don't think my husband would be thrilled with a toy that had all hot pink slides instead of the red, blue, green, and tan one we have.It held up great outdoors through our bad winter and hot summer. Hasnt faded at all and still looks brand new. Most important our son loves it and plays with it even more this year then last. For the money it seemed like the best choice for us b/c we got the most ""bang for our buck"" he was able to use it last year but looks like he will be able to use it for quite a few more years before he outgrows it.After reading all the reviews I felt confident in our decision and I am very happy with it still over a year later!"
5,great gym,"My daughter is 14 months going on 3 years. She's a daredevil and a heck of a climber already. I bought this gym at Walmart (cheapest I found). So far it's a hit. I found the assembly easy. As mentioned in a previous review, I used a heavy rubber mallet to pound stubborn pieces together. In all, I had it together by myself in less than 45min. I currently have it separated into two pieces (no tunnel connecting). So she has a playhouse with a door and a climber with 2 slides. I only did this because I think I got two of the same pieces for the tunnel. I am currently awaiting a return email from Little Tikes on how to handle this. Hopefully they will just send me the right piece. This gym is a hassle to haul home...you need a truck. Overall...I am happy with this product. Great toy, hope it lasts for a long time!!"
5,Not so tough to put together - use a rubber mallet,"Was a bit daunted by the reviews from previous buyers saying how difficult it was to assemble, but found that using a rubber mallet to pound the pieces into place (and not worry about bending/breaking any of the plastic) made a world of difference. Got the whole thing together, including getting it out of the box (which took almost 10 minutes by itself) and my daughter was crawling on it in under 45 minutes."
4,Easy to Put together and Hours of Fun Afterwards,"My husband and I picked up the toy at the store...BE AWARE the box is HUGH!! Its like 2 refrigerator boxes put together. (Product Measurement in inches: 65.0 x 175.0 x 45.0)So bring a Pickup Truck!! ..It will fit in a large SUV if the Seats are down and you take it out of the box..Gettig it home only took my husband 25 mins by himself.. its really easy, Just use your stand on the pieces will surely make them lock into place! No Tools Required just you! So buy one and Have F-U-N !!!"
4,Very fun climber!,I purchased this toy for my soon to be 2 year old daughter and she just loves it! She loves to play in the house area and make her dolls go down the slide. It's well worth the money!
3,Hard to assemble - and came apart,"Thirty Minutes? It took us a couple of hours in hot/humid Florida sun. I thought it was secure, after pounding it like crazy with a rubber mallot. But, the lawn guy moved it to mow under it, and the section with the door disassembled. We have experience putting other Little Tykes items together, and most are difficult to assemble, but durable. I'm starting to regret my purchase though, and the kids (2 and 4) are not exactly begging to play on it either. I don't think it's challenging enough for my children. I would have done better with a big swingset."
1,You need nuts and bolts instead......,"Questions #1-#3 I couldn't answer well because I had to refund this item. Two men (roofers!) and I couldn't put the first piece into the second piece. We had tried unsuccessfully for four hours and seven minutes. I am convinced not to buy Little Tikes ""slot-and-groove"" products anymore. Seeing the disappointment on my Daughter's face on her Birthday is certainly the resolve I need to stay away from this and similar products. 'Such a shame!"
2,biggest disappointment in little tikes,"it was played upon at my son's birthday party when he turned 3, and hardly afterwards. maybe it's a girl playground?it falls apart everytime it's moved.it's harder than heck to put together (body slamming is advised).my son's three and a half now, so this didn't even make it to 4.DO YOU WANNA BUY MINE? FREE DELIVERY IN NASHVILLE AREA"
5,Fun and,"Before purchasing this item I read all the reviews. I was a bit concerned after reading complaints about the difficult with assembly. I also was concerned about the size of the box. I didn't want to pay $175. to have it delivered.I decided to go to TRUS and purchase the 8 in 1. My daughter is turning two next week so I thought it would be appropriate for her age. My husband and I took the seats out of our minivan and headed over to the store. The box was large!! Probably the size of a refridgerator...it fit in our minivan with plenty of room to spare once out of the box. Once home, my husband and I put it together in less than 30 minutes. At times you really need to put some muscle into it, however, tools are not needed. Everything will fit. Our daughter loves it and it looks really nice in the backyard!"
3,Good & Bad,We have had this playset for 3+ years. It has both good and bad points. On the good side the slide tower has been a wonderful toy and has held up well. The playhouse side does not fit well together and we eventually had to abandon it because it would fall apart during use.
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!!,I read all the reviews. I knew many said it was hard to put together. I was hesitant. We got it home. This thing is BIG!!! We had it together and the kids playing in less than an hour. Many said to use a 2x4 and that is soooooo true. The kids love it and we couldn't be happier!
4,Fun even for the inside.,"I bought this toy for my children last X-mas. We live in New England where the winters are long and hard. We put this up on the inside of our house in the Children's playroom so that they could get some physical activity indoors throughout the winter. (The room is not that big, the playground takes up most of it, but it is still a life saver on rainy and other indoor days.) It beats watching video's all day. My only complaint is that it was a little tough to put together. The joints did not ""fall"" into place so easily and I found myself using amateur martial arts moves to stomp some of the pieces into place."
3,summer fun?,"We had bought this playcenter for our 2 sons (1 & 2 yrs old) for their birthdays thinking this would be a wonderful toy for them to play with during the summer months. It is a very cute looking play center, but not worth the money. My children would rather play with their ride on toys then this after having spent all the money on it. ugh! I read many reviews stating they had problems assembling the center...the only part my husband and I had and still have problems with was the tunnel...its still not together! It just doesnt seem to fit in the hole like the instructions say it does...we called little tikes and they sent us a new one (which arrived last week). The woman at Little Tikes didnt give me a hard time about it at all, just sent me a new tunnel...making me think other people have had the same difficulties as we have."
2,Less fun than anticipated,"I bought this playground about 4 years ago when my daughter was almost 2. I figured that with the recommended age range up to 8, it would be $300+ well spent. However, it just wasn't that much of a hit with her or her friends. It's been used occasionally for a few minutes at a time, not much of a draw. I don't think she's used it once since she turned 5. So much for recommended age up to 8.The yellow archway connector over the big slide comes apart all the time, even a child can pull it off. When we move it to mow the lawn (not a small effort), the playhouse part comes apart. It's also a major undertaking to change the configuration of the pink tunnel, so make sure you like the way you've got it when you put it together!"
1,don't bother,"There are a total of maybe four good tracks, on the first cd of three. The rest are junk."
5,Clay's voice is Spirit-filled blue eyed soul,"Clay Crosse is one of my all time favorites...This CD is truly AWESOME....the song "" Walk a Mile "" changed my life...brought me back to Christ"
2,Raffinee,It did not have the smell. I think it was old. I ordered multiple and I was not happy with the product.
4,Nice floral-ish scent that lingers well...,"Bought this ""unsmelled"" from Amazon.The scent out of the bottle is pretty sweet/floral -- but it mellows out after a bit (as scents tend to do) into a nice, lingering floral with some hints of spice."
5,TRACK LIST,1) If I Didn't Care 2) We Three 3) Maybe 4) My Prayer 5) When The Swallows Come Back To Capistrano 6) Bless You 7) Whispering Grass (Don't Tell The Trees) 8) Do I Worry? 9) I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire 10) Don't Get Around Much Anymore 11) Java Jive 12) Stop Pretending 13) I'm Getting Sentimental Over You 14) Someone's Rocking My Dream Boat 15) Christopher Columbus 16) Your Feet's Too Big 17) That Cat Is High 18) Slap That Bass 19) I'll Never Smile Again 20) Who Wouldn't Love You
5,Presenting the 21st Century Alternative to Runaway Big Government,"With a new preface by the author, the phenomenal classic on the American libertarian philosophy is now back in print and available to a new generation of readers interested in the constitutional alternative to socialism and 'liberalism' in the United States. In the tradition of Bastiat, Hazlitt, von Mises, and Ayn Rand, Prof. Hospers dispatches one Big-Government cliché and fallacy after another in clear and understandable English. An important resource in the arsenal of liberty, this 2007 edition includes a new preface by Dr. Hospers which discusses some of the most critical issues facing Americans today. The book that launched a movement can inspire us all again in the struggle to recapture the spirit of American freedom under constitutional law.Libertarianism: A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow"
5,"A must own DVD, along with the other three.","As a desensitized viewer, regular programming doesn't do it for me anymore. The minds that put these episodes together are on par with my own. As a native Georgian, I probably ""get it"" a little more than most non residents. If you enjoy sick, twisted, violent, idiotic, bizarre, hilarious humor...well then step right up and start being a Squidbilly. Early Cuyler for President!"
2,meh,"not as good as seasons 1-3. This is apparently in some sort of movie format where they spend extensive time making fun of Arabs. I'll over look things to an extent, but once it became clear this was going to be just one, long racist joke I shut it off. Not really a fan of that - even if it's meant satirically. I mean I laughed at Borat - a lot - this just wasn't funny."
5,El Primo Porno,"This was an especially forceful and good collection from a female porn editor (Mel stands for Melanie). I liked this collection so much that I looked up her name and ordered her other title (which is ALSO primo). Her other title is ""Sweet Lips"" and is a strange cowboy story. It proves a point that not all porno is the exclusive domain of the men folk. I look forward to reading more from this author in the future and will be looking out for her. I believe this was an Alleyson book and in my judgment they made a good call on publishing this title!"
2,Over the top violence!,"This movie is way over the top with unneccessary violence(done terribly by the way),and such awful acting by ShahRukh Khan too! His problem was over acting in every bit of the movie, he should learn that less is more sometimes but I think it's inherent in his style of acting. Kajol wasn't too bad except that someone should have told her to lose that mono-brow of hers before filming! The saving grace of this movie was the story line and some dignified and believable acting from the mother, the bad uncle and Salman Khan, thus the 2 star rating. Will I watch it again? Nah, unless it's to perversely amuse oneself by watching what bad acting is all about!"
1,"Awful movie, very bloody and violent","I usually love Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this was a terrible movie. I thought Salman fared better in it than Shah Rukh did. I really liked the two female costars, one of which was Kajol and I don't know the other one's name, but she was Salman's romantic interest. To me, she was the star of the show--what an incredible dancer! This movie is full of violence and blood. In almost every scene with the boys' mother, she was being beaten up and I got used to seeing her with blood on her head all the time. Even children were being beaten and killed. The only good thing in this movie was the dancing--that was it. The dancing was very traditional and very entertaining. But the movie itself? Awful, awful, awful. I give this movie one star for the dancing only."
2,Read of Shayne's novels instead,"***Review containers spoilers***This is a novella, which centres on Puabi - a dark Immortal High Witch. She throws herself into the sea after her husband leaves her to burn in their house, as he runs off with his mistress. Matthew rescues her from the sea. Puabi could be the twin of his dead wife, Gabrielle.The story is about redemption and love and has an unbelievable happy ending.It was a compelling read but not a satisfying one - even though I knew I was going to get a predictable romance before I started reading. I don't usually mind that - so I guess I must have found other elements of the story unsatisfying and that is probably down to the length - not enough time for characters to be drawn properly and events to unfold at a natural pace."
4,Great short story,"As I didn't pay attention to the number of pages, I was shocked at how small the book was. It says 96 pages, but is actually only 84 in reading. But, short story or not, it was a great read! I thought it might be too far fetched, too sci-fi to be a romance as well, but Shayne made the characters very believable. Can't wait to read more of her books!"
2,okay,"This is the first book I've read from Shayne's witch series. I wasn't expecting it to be a short story. It's actually 84 pages long. Needless to say I finished it in one evening. It was sweet and sappy like most romances are. What I didn't like about it was the fact that they fell in love with each other almost immediately. Reguardless of the fact that she was a total B***H to him. It was just sooooooo over the top. And then when she admitted to killing (and I don't mean just one-I'm talking lots) he seemed okay with that because he felt he murdered his wife because he didn't pay enough attention to her. Oh, boohoo!Sorry, but I think weakness is lame."
3,Short and Sweet,If you've ready any of Maggie Shayne's Immortal witch stories - this is a must ready. It tells the story of Puabi the dark witch mentioned in earlier books.
3,Nice scent,"Love the scent but I've had trouble with some of the sticks just not staying lit, so they don't fully burn."
2,Scorched writings!,"This book is disappointing, very disappointing indeed. Firstly, there are not many pictures of the band, the pic on the front cover could have been better too. Worse still though, the writer seems to get sidetracked too often, her sentences are quite long at times and she has a habit of using fancy words that some fans (no offence anyone) would not understand. Recommended only for true Pumpkins, otherwise I personally wouldn't buy it."
5,Our Choice for All Around,Simply can't beat these blades. We keep one in the Tsaw and one in the miter saw for general work. Leaves a good surface on solid wood. Our expensive Forset blades just sit on the rack now except for plywood and mitering. These work really well for genral cross cutting at the miter saw. Cheap to buy and easy to sharpen.
4,2 years of use and still cuts great!,"I've been using this blade on hardwood, softwood, crap wood, plywood, particle board, and MDF and it's still working fine. I can tell the blade is getting dull now, but I've gotten two years out of it without it going to the sharpener. It's just now starting to slow down as I cut wood. I keep it really clean (especially after pine) and I think that has not only helped the cuts, but has also helped keep it from burning the wood. In fact, the only time I did get a burn from it was when my fence got bumped out of alignment and my cuts were pinched. Other than that it's been great. The only thing I don't care much for is it's thin kerf. I bought it thinking that I might like the thinner kerf, but I found I really don't like having to compensate for it."
3,Wrong item,"I received a belt from a different manufacturer than Oregon. I researched the new part I got and found that the belt size was 1/2"" bigger then the Oregon. The seller was very quick to respond, and gave me a full refund."
1,Horrible,"This book was a major disappointment! I have read other R. Benson books that were good but this is plain garbage.It is such a rip off to ""You Only Live Twice"" for the romance. If you recall in the movie perhaps the book too but it's been sooooooo long since I read it:-), James falls for a girl, she gets killed and beds the next girl he works with in Japan (again). Plus she is only 20 years old. Give me a break! Bond is old enough to be her father. The storyline is hard to follow and you never have an understanding for the villian and why he acts the way he does. It is violent and bloody to read. Best advice, reread one of Ian Fleming's books like I plan to reread ""You Only Live Twice""."
1,The Man With No Writing Skills,"It's a sad commentary on how corporations can annoint someone a best-selling author, complete with promotion accounts, regardless of whether the writer is any good at all.This book shows how consistently cliche, weak, and predictable Benson's Bond series remains. Ian Fleming could describe masterfully yet stay brief. Benson imitates this by describing every detail of a hotel lobby, thinking this makes it descriptive writing. It doesn't.The plot itself is predictable and formulated with all the usual characters to drag it along.Don't waste your money on this pap, even if you're looking for a light beach read. There are countless others to choose from, starting with Fleming's original work, soon to be reissued."
2,A disppointment...,"This is not one of Benson's best, neither is it among his worst. I find all of his Bond's far superior to John Gardner's and so inferior to Ian Fleming's that no comparison is just. Mistakes like having someone major in business at Oxford bother me alot. I do not enjoy reading tour guide excerpts much either. It moved quickly enough not to be boring, but the ending was truncated and very disappointing. Some of the scenes were interesting. I do not blame Benson per se, Bond is not a plausible figure out of his necessary historical period.I confess to being a purist. I suggest reading, or rereading, the Fleming books if one wants the authentic Bond. The first four films are good too."
2,A Boring Bond,"The idea of taking bond back to Japan was excellent as was the bits of info on Japanese culture. However, the novel was less than thrilling. Bond is written as a physically weak character which is not consistent with his reputation. The sex scenes are boring and the action slow. The 2nd battle with the dwarf was insulting to the reader after their fight in the Casseopia tunnel. Also, where were the gadgets, car chases, etc.? The novel does, in fact, read like a Japanese tourist brochure. Way too much detail! This is not Bond at his best. Mr. Benson, please bring back the Bond we love!"
4,Fair Bond,". See storyline above.Raymond Benson's version of 007 is adequate. This time 007, in order to save the world, must find a deadly virus. This virus is a highly altered version of the West Nile virus.Benson takes you through the beautiful country of Japan and its nearby provinces. You'll learn about the Japanese mafia. You'll be intrigued by some unusual customs practiced their. This was a bare bones thriller. Fast-paced and quick to read.Recommended for the hardcore Bond fan"
5,Outstanding!,"I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. This book had me gripping the covers from the moment I began until the second I finished it. It's fast-paced, interesting, and exciting. I can sense Fleming's original Bond in these pages, and Benson shows that he is a terrific storyteller. Try it for yourself, as well as his other works. These books soar...!"
1,tourist brochure,"It's hard to get involved in plot when every other paragraph reader has to endure a Japanese expression which takes a paragraph to describe/explain. then there's the odd usage--tyre vs tire, which not even an Englishman like Ian Fleming used in his works, and Benson (American?) wasn't consistent in using them; then there is strange use of ""storeys"", rather than 'stories'or 'storys'. Even beyond travelogue, plot drags with no sense of drama, and logical gaps--as another reviwer pointed out, if you have bug-magnet, why not use beforehand rather than wait (too late) for flying mosquitoes."
5,Great Bond experience.,"I enjoyed reading ""Tattoo"" because it not only provides an exciting adventure in the 007 tradition, but it includes location details that actually put the reader into the fantasy. This adventure takes place in Japan, and Raymond Benson's research into customs, social interests, food and politics are outstanding. I completed it in record time and was hungry for more!"
5,A cry of delight!,"As a 1st generation American, I have never been to Iran. When I picked up ""Cry of the Peacock,"" all of a sudden, a whole world opened to me!Nahai's vivid imagery and use of magical realism entrance readers into the the scent, sound, sight, and feel of life in Iran through the many kings, the Constitutional Revolution, the reign of the Pahlavis and the present government.I learned so much of my country's history and culture. I now know why we are ""a culture of sorrow"" and why we have so much to offer the world.A must-read to anyone from Iran or anyone who wants to understand the beauty of the Middle East.Nahai's writing echoes Isabel Allende, Toni Morrison, and Amy Tan. It was a pleasure to read this book."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I bought this for my daughter and at first she really enjoyed it. Each button has three different responses. But when we changed the batteries, the book sounded drunk and the voice kept skipping. Maybe I had a defective book."
4,John Denver & the Muppets: A Christmas Together,The first CD is a collection of beautiful songs John recorded with the Muppets for a Christmas special in the late '70s. It's full of carols you love and ones you soon will. This is one of the most touching Christmas albums of all time and it stays in my CD player from Thanksgiving Day until at least New Year's. It's the perfect family Christmas CD.
4,Solid EP from Calobo frontman...,"I have all of Calobo's studio albums but am just now getting David Andrews' solo work. This EP is actually from 1996, while Calobo was still together, and features Andrews' trademark guitar melodies and vocal harmonies. Warm, engaging and intimate songwriting, mostly mid-tempo, but very satisfying. Recommended."
4,Pretty useful book about knots,"I find this book to be pretty useful in explaining how to tie a lot of different kinds of knots, ranging from useful knots for fishermen to climbers, to general purpose for camping, securing loads on vehicles, to tree trimming, etc."
3,ok for quick trim or using cord,Battery doesn't hold a charge long enough to shave my head. After about 1/2 way it loses charge and I have to go back to cord. Does a pretty good job and if you aren't shaving for more than a few minutes you'd be happy. Not too bad for the price.
1,not all it's cracked up to be,"blades are dull, have to go over the same area several times for decent results"
2,"noisy, cheap combs, heats","Used once, and decided to return it.Pros: this is a nicely designed piece in a nice storage box. Engine seems reasonably strong and battery life is long. But...Cons: (1) I used the shortest comb and did my whole head for several minutes. After nothing further came off, I looked at the mirror and discovered that the result was horribly uneven and cluttered. Only after shifting to the next shortest comb and spending extra 10 minutes on fixing the result it ended up okay. (2) In the process, I also took off the comb for fine trimming, but I could barely touch my skin without getting burned: after 20 minutes of work, the blade was insanely hot! Finally, (3) the machine is very noisy compared to others I've used before.I went back to use my old Panasonic, but this one is really decaying and mostly unusable at this point. Need to find another one soon..."
1,The nosiest clipper ever...,I recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the Andis Company 22560 Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Hair Clipper Kit.
4,Cordless Hair Clipper Kit,"I gave this to a bearded man for Christmas. To my knowledge, he has used it only once, with no complaints. Was nice for the main reason, he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one. This one is so convenient and I am sure he enjoys it. Purchasing was a breeze. Thank you"
5,Top Notch,This item is exactly what I had envisioned and when I found it on your website I didn't hesitate to order it. It came quickly and was pretty easy to put together. Love it and would definitely recommend this item. Now I am looking for a matching nightstand with 3 drawers.
5,wade,"This was probably my least favorite of this series, but I still loved it and will read it again, and again."
1,very low quality ..,"The sweatpants got very small after first washing. But the real problem was that one leg became almost two inches shorter than the other! Never had such a weird issue before. It looks funny. I cannot use it anymore..It was hot summer and did not use it after purchasing in the spring. Now it is too late to return.. So, it is now a piece of junk.Advice: wash right after purchasing and check if both legs are even.."
1,STAY AWAY FROM DEAL RACK. (seller),This order was placed with Deal Rack for a pair of sweat pants Cost; about $23.00. The cost to ship this pair of sweat pants to me was approximately $7.00. The pants labeled as Medium actually were for a man weighing about 200 pounds and probably over 6 feet tall. The seller was willing to accept a return. BUT I HAVE TO PAY THE RETURN POSTAGE because of his sizing mistake.When you add together all the shipping costs they will probably equal 50% of the purchase price.No bargain. Stay away.
1,LINT Everywhere!,"These pants felt nice and thick. I always wash things before I wear them and that is when I found my washtub wall lined with fuzzies!I thought, okay, this is just the loose stuff, the rest will come off in the dryer.I dried them and got a tennis ball size ball of fluff off them, so kept tumble drying on air only and five drying session later I am still getting huge amounts of lint.I will not be wearing them as I can foresee that the will be dropping lint all over the house.Unfortunately, I bought 3 pairs because I thought the reviews sounded good, and washed all three pairs, or I would be returning them.VERY disappointing."
4,Good sweat pants,They are good standard sweats. They've been washed several times and are holding up well. I ordered XL and they are definitely XL.
5,sweat pants,Very pleased with this product. Thicker and more durable than what you buy from the store
3,Got what I paid for,"The sweatpants were oversized and not real thick. I bought them for knock around use and they serve that purpose. They are not top of the line but I didn't pay a top price for them. All in all, they are about what I expected."
3,ok,Sweats are really comfortable. I shrunk them the first wash so they fit perfect (were slightly big to begin with). Would have given them 4 stars but after only 2 washes one of the pockets got a hole. Easy fix tho. Still for the price they aren't bad.
2,already cracking,"I bought this in November 2012. I like the handles. what I don't like is the fact that it has started to split at the seam, and the handle color has rubbed off and they now look a dirty light brown."
5,Love the color,Not only do I love the color but it is functional and very stylish. I was also looking for a case with a handle.
4,Another great on from Spyro Gyra,I haven't picked up a Syro Gyra CD in a while. Saw this at library and glad I grabed it. I've seen them several times and heard a couple from this C live. Dave Samuels joins for about 4 tracks.If you ever get a chance to see them live jump on it!
1,Disapointed,This product worked great in the beginning but it didn't last long. I think I've been using it for about 1 1/2 months. Now it works occasionally but not very consistantly. It's headed for the trash.
4,Great book!,"My Mother purchased this for me after the birth of my son. I love to read it to him. It's very lyrical with wonderful pictures. A good reminder for me, too. Brings back the memories of when he was first born. Would be a great book to read to a child who is getting ready for a new sibling. Shows the world through the babies eyes."
3,"Eastern music for Western ears, a little too mellow","Do not operate heavy machinery while listening to this album! This reminds me a lot of Silk Road II by Kitaro. It is more eastern than Silk Road II, but still manages to be New Age at the same time. This is accessible eastern music, with no Samisen. The entire disc is very tranquil, but pleasant to listen to. On the Kitaro Scale, it rates about a 5, or the equivalent of taking a couple of NyTol."
5,Healthy Alternative,"Dr. Randy W. Martin, author of ""Optimal Health - How To Get It, How To Keep It"", explores every avenue of health with precision. This very comprehensive yet user friendly manual is a must for anyone serious about preventitive medicine and it's practical usages. This book not only covers traditional western medicine, but details Chinese medicine, homeopathic and nutrition. Dr. Martin also addresses men and women health issues, as well as Pediatrics. Well, it's about time that someone has taken the time to proactively administer the plain facts with such a wealth of answers. This book rarely stays in my bookcase, but at my bedside! Thank you Dr. Martin!"
5,"the BEST decorating book, and I have at least 20","This book explains in so many useful ways how to create a home, that makes you proud of living in it. The photographs are very beautiful and well chosen, and the author explains step by step how to mix colors, patterns and not to forget how to arrange furniture and pictures in order to create a relaxed atmosphere. You will not regret buying this book, it is next to the awesome pictures really worth reading! ENJOY!!!"
1,Best Left Unplayed,"The great Dizzy Gillespie recorded this CD in 1989 with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and a few additional side men. Diz passed away in 1993. Gillespie is one of my favorite musicians; however, at this point in his career his capabilities on the trumpet had faded drastically. Sadly, this CD doesn't offer much. Diz does not play well, and even the quality of the recording is sub-standard. If you want to hear Gillespie when he was on the top of the jazz world, pick up any of the following: Dizzier and Dizzier, OO Bop, Briks Works or Rhythmstick. Better yet- get them all."
4,picture better than real,"i'm a bit sad, product's picture is a bit better than real thing, but it's fine. i like it"
5,Where the rubber meets the road . . . . .,"I arrived in Viet Nam in March of 1966 and was assigned as a pilot to 1st Cav's 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion (Stacked Deck). I carried the 7th Cav into various battles and never questioned Col Moore's analysis of the situation. We always knew that if Col Moore would go there, we would go. We all did our job as best we could and often under fire. He darn sure fully and accurately assessed McNamara. If you ever have the honor of saluting Hal Moore, do it with pride. He's as good as they get. Don Estes (KIA), who is mentioned in the book, was a personal friend of mine. I saw him die . . . but that's another story."
5,"Hal Moore is not Emerson, but it'll do","I admit, the book does not flow well. In fact, it reminds me slightly of Catch-22 in that is seems to jump around, even though it doesn't, even though Catch-22 did, and now I've gone cross-eyed. The point is, it reads like a report to a general. And that's probably more what it is. Hal Moore is not an author, he's a retired Lt. General. Galloway was a reporter, not a novelist. They aren't going to write a nice neat book like Tom Clancy. The reality of the battle is to me reflected in the reality of how the book was written, namely in a manner I expect from a soldier, not a writer. The book is compelling because it's real, and it's never been told this way before. A must read in my opinion for anyone curious about Vietnam."
3,Solid and Significant...but Boring at times,"I have yet to see the movie so I am unable to compare the two. However I know that this book, in the years to come, will serve better as a historical document than a weekend read. The authors take care to mention as many of those who participated in Ia Drang as possible. This slows down the read, but as i said makes it historically significant. The book takes you through the two main parts of the battle, and describes in detail the harsh realities of war. In my opinion this book should be read by history and military buffs, although it would make a great source if you were writing a paper on the Vietnam War."
3,"Definitive account of Ia Drang, albeit heart wrenching","I read the book twice and saw the movie twice. The movie does not do justice to the book. It is the best historical record of a brutal battle in Vietnam in 1965. However, the book does not flow easily. Nonetheless, it is painful to imagine the staggering losses on both sides with the Americans having a 5 to 1 kill advantage. But 200 troopers killed in this battle from Custer's old 7th Cav made me reflect that history repeated itself somewhat because Custer lost about 200 troopers too. Hal Moore had high technology to back him up in the way of air support and artillery. Custer had neither. And yet the losses are the same. Politicians should read this book rather than us military history buffs to learn what the human cost is to wage war. Like Fredericksburg, Ia Drang drives home the old saying that war never decides who is right, only who is left."
5,Timely In Any Year,"Soon to be 50 years ago, not unlike the '90's when we remembered our veterans who fought and died in WWII, it's time to read this exceptional and historical work about one of the great battles of the Vietnam War. We cannot forget the sacrifices made by the American heroes of the war, no matter how historians opine it's merit or its outcome. Each page tells us about real soldiers who did Americas's work. The book also reminds the reader of the horrors or war and the impact of each injury and death upon all of America."
5,Vivid account,"This is one of the most vivid accounts of the war in Vietnam I have read. The young men who fought there were the true heroes of their generation. It gives new meaning to the phrase ""War is hell."""
5,A Must Read!,"This is perhaps the best book that I have ever read. I could not put it down. The author replays what happened in the Ia Drang Valley, minute by minute as told by the soldiers who fought there...on both sides. This is definitely going to become a classic. What I like about the book is the author tells the story the way it was, without the sideline drama. You definitely feel as though you are transported back into the steaming jungles of the Ia Drang Valley. I would recommend this book to anyone that appreciates military history. This is a must read."
5,Required reading for anyone who thinks wars are romantic.,"This is an excellent book. It will make difficult reading, I think, for anyone without some war experience. The author did a wonderful job of distinguishing for the reader what the soldiers knew at the time and what is now known about the battle."
5,We Were Soldiers Once - Book review,"This book is co-authored by the Colonel in command of the battalion engaged in this pivotal action early in the Vietnamise War. It is authentic and very descriptive of that action, the events surrounding it and the effect it had on future actions. It is particularly attentive to the individual human aspects of the events both during the battle and on the home front. The other co-author provides the touch and thoroughness of a professional writer. Inputs from North Vietnamise commanders, during the action, documented the events from the oponents perspective.It is an excellant book."
5,An American Military Epic.....,"After you read Sheehan's A BRIGHT SHINING LIE and McMaster's DERELICTION OF DUTY, pick this book up and cry at the smug hubris that sent these sons of WWII veterans into the hell that became Vietnam.God Bless them and may God always hold them....Garry Owen!"
5,Book has become required reading for my highschool students.,Three years ago I read the book. Today we have 150 copies of the book in our history dept. Each student in my American History class must read the book. For those of you who do not like the book come to my classroom and see the effect it has had on my students.General Moore is a true American patriot.O
4,Now I understand...,"Because I am a woman, I will never see ground battle. Because I am 40, I want to know what my male peer group experienced during that drawn-out, significant, memorable period of my life now refered to as ""the Vietnam era."" ""We Were Soldiers..."" was gritty and real, immediate yet contemplative. I learned a little about the men who were drafted and those who chose military careers, then how they went to war, performed under extreme pressure, perservered under incredible situations and died under worse, and returned whole or shattered, dead or alive, to their now-distant homeland. A welcome afterword section also introduced me to some of the people who waited stateside only to have to learn to live without their soldiers. Now I understand military teamwork, hierarchy, politics, protocol. Now I am glad I was never expected to serve, yet grateful that these authors so vividly recounted their experiences, making them real for me."
4,Essential Reading For All,"As a non-American living in the US for a year, I bought this book to learn more about the Vietnam war. It didn't really serve its purpose in this respect - and that was my fault - but it more than made up for it by being one of the best war books I've ever read. This stands easily alongside anything Stephen Ambrose ever wrote. The authenticity is one hundred per cent because these authors were there - their passion, emotion and commitment to their mean comes screaming through the pages. As does their frustration with military top brass and politicians. I'll never forget finishing the book on a Sunday morning, sitting up in bed, tears streaming down my face as I read of the impact of the deaths of those brave men who perished. The consequences hit generation after generation. This book is essential reading now because it highlights the futility of war and the no-win situation that America repeatedly puts itself into."
5,A Wonderful Tribute and Shocking Book,"This is not an easy book to read. That isn't a statement on the writing style or the way the book is organized. I found this a difficult book to read because of its content. Several times, more than I could count, I stopped reading and found myself staring off into space as the impact of what I had just read was beginning to sink in. Bravery and nobility, even in the face of such horror and violence, all in a day's work. I was humbled by the almost nonchalant way in which these men spoke about their role in the battles at LZ X-ray and Albany. I have't cried in reading a book in a long time but I could not hold back tears when reading the chapter at the end in which the wives and children back in the States told their own tales of how the battle impacted their lives. This book made me feel so very proud of all of our men and women who went to Vietnam, fought for our country, risked everything, and in far too many cases, never came back home."
3,I never knew....,"I had always thought I knew a lot about the Vietnam War. However, after reading this book I realized that I might know some dates, facts, names, and generalizations but I did not know the human cost of the war.I think for many of us, we know why our guys were there, we know that many Americans had different opinions about the war, we know about the Tet Offensive and maybe the Tonkin Gulf incident but I never realized that I did not know about the many battles fought over there and I certainly did not know how bloody they were.In graphic and moving detail the authors of this book use personal experiences and the voices of others who were there to tell the story of Ia Drang.We can debate the politics of the war for ages. We can debate how the war was fought forever. One thing we can not debate is how brave the soldiers who fought there were. And this book clearly shows that."
5,The REAL STORY!!!,The authors brought me into their battle. Morerealistic than a movie. The Audiobook was just what is needed to have someone tell the storyso your mind can create the vision. What happens in battle can not be second guessed. Fate took a turn here. Thanks to the Authors-->a fine service to the Vietnam Vets & U.S. History.
5,A pressing look at war at its worst.,"General Moore's sobering account of the First Air Cav. in the battle of Ia Drang shows you, the reader, just how the war in Vietnam was, up close and dirty. This book is recommended for anyone with and interest in the Vietnam Conflict"
5,Perfect,"The greatest book I've ever bought. Very poetic in more than one way it gives the men and women who have, do and will serve ever lasting life to their sacrifices."
5,Better than the movie!,"I have seen the movie, both before and after reading the book, and the book is much much better that the movie."
5,Incredible War Epic,"This book is extremely well written. I'm not a soldier, but I could easily follow the battle sequences, in fact, they had me riveted to my seat. I couldn't put the book down.There are numerous detailed reviews, so I won't get into the minutae of the book. I'll only say that this book gave me a true appreciation for what our Soldiers and Marines went through during the ground war in Vietnam. Many of the battles are written in such gut wrenching detail I felt like I was in the trench with the soldiers.I highly recommend this book."
5,WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!!!,"For a long time I have been biased towards reading only WW II histories and therefore thought that no book could describe war better than MacDonalds 'Company Commander'. Well, I was wrong, and this is the book that convinced me of this. This is without a doubt the harshest, most vivid picture of war I have yet to see between the covers of a book. Moore describes, literally, every moment of the most ferocious battle in Vietnam. And unlike the movie, which only shows you half the battle, he tells about the second big NVA attack that decimated the Americans. In this book you will see war in all of its horrific colors, like you have probably, never seen before. In fact it almost makes a war historian not want to study war any more. There is no glory here...only bravery and terror and horror and pain. Pleasse take time to read this book that is oh so different from the movie...you will not be disappointed..."
5,Gripping true to life...,"I finished the book over a month ago-I usually don't review at all-& especially with the top review from Ramon A. Nadal who participatedin the battle-[much respect]However I thought it was a pretty even-handed account of the battle-policies of the time & emotional content wasn't overdone.I prefer documentery style books/movies etc...It wasn't masked by any 60's rhetoric of the times-which is nice-altho it was very ""in the moment"".I wanted to get a feel for real combat-as opposed to soldiers as numbers- as Im actively opposing aggressive wars in Afghanistan & Iraq.John Findlay"
3,A little too dry for me,"An interesting book, but I have read many others in the genre that were a better read. I picked this up after watching the movie, and I have to say that it was a good companion read, filling in the missing details from the film. Still, there are better alternatives to this book, unless you are an avid history buff who simply must have all the details."
2,Dry Yet Accurate,"Well I have to say this book definately was an accurate accountof what occured in Vietnam. The brutality and anguish the soldiers went through was accurately told but was dry as the Sahara desert. For a true war lover, or for somebody who wants an accurate account of war in Vietnam from people who were there it's good, otherwise I suggest the movie or a book that doesn't drag on."
4,Ia Drang in detail,"General Moore did a fine job interviewing survivors and re-enacting the entire battle. His initial chapters describe the training and the strategies behind airmobile forces. Having already seen the movie, I expected to read more about the effect of the battle on the home life of the involved families, but the book limits itself almost entirely to the intricacies of battle.Let me warn the readers who lack military expertise: General Moore wrote in explicit detail of the ground maneuvers. A person who has no recollection of Vietnam's geography will need a map better than the one in the front of the book. Additionally, plan to read in large sections at a time because reading a page or two at a time confuses the descriptions of who is supporting whose flank, who is farther west, and so on.Overall, a very interesting book with just enough human detail to portray Ia Drang as a personal experience at the same time that it was a military event."
5,Changed My View of War,"This book is well written and gives you the sense of being in this horrible battle. I have always been one interested in war and somewhat glorified war. This book taught me that there is no glory in war, only loss. The men who fought there were brave and in my mind tremendous heroes. I salute them all."
4,Depressingly realistic,The carnage of Ia Drang is shocking...there are incredible acts of heroism--the kind only something as horrible as war can bring out. Emotionally gut wrenching. Our troops in Vietnam were real heroes. Shame on those in the '60s who didn't honor our warriors...
1,not as expected,"I came intrsted with this book after I saw the movie, which I saw it many times and I determined to get more information about the the real events by reading the book which was the base of the movie. but I was disappointed when I read the book and I found it not intersting. it looks as it was written by someone who dosn't know how to till a story. I don't like this book."
1,"Amazing Topic, Poorly Written","When I think of this book and the movie made from it, I wonder how they did that. Trying to gather comprehensible, story-telling scenes for a motion picture from this jumble of poorly written hodgepodge would have been very difficult-hats off to the screenwriter.Admittedly I, who read at least one to two books a week, was unable to get more than halfway through this one. I pushed myself hard to finish it, but reading again and again about the major screwups by field officers which caused the deaths of so many men and the way the commander (author) never placed blame or showed criticism for those junior to him made me lose all interest. Perhaps later in the book Moore court-marshalled them all and everything came out well in the end. As an officer he may be among the great; as an author he should have found a good ghostwriter."
1,Should be reclasified as FICTION,As I'm a slow typer look under VIDEO Amazon.com look under Vietnam:They Were Young and Brave customer comments for my review of this book Russell L. Ross 1741 Maysong ct San Jose calif 95131 408 926 9336
1,An orgy of Americanism self-indulgence,"This book is exactly what Americans love after Sept 11, 2001. It pampers to the myth of the American heroic spirit in war. The purpose of the book is to glorify the "" brotherhood"" and ""bond"" of American soldiers using their superior firepower to inflict maximum kills on the enemy. The high moral tone of the book started with the mention about the Air Calvary's historical links to Custer. How can the authors take pride in associating themselves with a barbaric Indian killer? And like Custer, the US military in Vietnam thought they could take on the North Vietnamese Army whom they regarded as no more sophisticated than the American Indians slaughtered by them in the 19th Century.There was some tribute paid to the Vietnamese but it was done grudgingly. The only way the American soldier can prove himself is to take on an enemy with equal firepower.I am glad I didn't buy this book with its load of self-indulgent nostalgia."
5,THE REAL WAR,"MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE, THOUGH IT WAS VERY TELLING.Written by a real soldier and shows what war, at least in Vietnam, is like."
1,No good.,"As much as I liked the first release ""Jigsaw Pieces"" that was interesting not to repetative and an amazingly produced sound recording. This one is dull boring. Sound productions is very low. I listened to it a couple of times and ready to sell it."
4,Loved it!,"The sound is clear and the pink is hot! =) Watch out though, I though that because this was so bright and not many people have this shade that I wouldn't have to worry about it getting swipped as much. I was wrong. It got swipped. =( I'm going to have to get another one..."
2,Very hard to hear anything...,"This looks good, and it is packaged well, but the sound quality was terrible. Will probably not use it again."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this stethoscope so that my grandchild could listen to heartbeats, but it didn't work well at all. We could barely hear anything. I plan to return it."
1,Awful,"This is easily the worst (WORST!) stethoscope I have ever owned. The ear pieces fell off and the acoustics are poor. Don't be hooked in by the price, this is a piece of junk."
1,BOGUS SELLER,"I have never been so disappointed in an online experience in my life. The supplier, Medex Supply basically are crooks. They sold me a stethoscope that was supposedly brand new. When it came it was in an unsealed box and did not work.There was no auscultation or sound emitted from the bell of the stethoscope whatsoever. When I contacted them, they told me to contact the manufacturer. Medex took my money, and then refused to refund me. I had the stethoscope 1 hour found out the problem and immediately e-mailed them. They took 2 days to respond to say they would contact me in the future, then they contacted me two days later to say contact the manufacturer which was ADC.This was a total waste of my time, and robbery of my money."
1,Difficult to hear,I bought this in addition to a littman cardiology III as a backup and all I can say wow what a night and day difference. The littman is much clearer and louder whereas with this particular stethoscope requires excellent hearing IMO to be used. I say why strain to hear something when all you have to do is take the extra few weeks worth of savings and buy a real stethoscope especially for those who considering a profession in the medical field.
2,"Not as good as what others said, IMHO.","I use Stethoscope a lot on pt., but very honestly to comment that the BS quality is not as that good/clear as what others said. Compared to Omron which is much cheaper & more heavier, but I can listen more clear."
3,Ok,"Very nice item, it still isn't the best stethoscope ive ever used, and the ear peices it comes with wont stay on."
3,Not as pictured,"I was disappointed when the product arrived, it was pictured with orange bells and was grey in the box. I would of much rather had the orange bells."
1,Unhappy,I am a home care nurse and use this frequently during work.I haven't had this stethoscope very long and the ear pieces keep coming off. I have been lucky enough to find them both times but very inconvenient to keep losing them!
1,wrong item,I was sent a ADC 609bk instead of a 603. still waiting to find out if they can cross ship a replacement.
3,"Well made, low Efficiency","This stethoscope is beautifully made, and looks to be a clone of the Littman Classic II SE. This stethsocope has been independently reviewed at http://www.forusdocs.com/reviews/Acoustic_Stethoscope_Review.htm which rated scopes on the basis of loudness and clarity.Sound clarity on this scope is good but loudness is poor. You will need good hearing to use this stethoscope."
4,Great value for a good field/ER stethoscope.,Good stethoscope for the money. As a paramedic this serves my needs well in the field and I do not have to worry about losing/breaking an expensive stethoscope.Pros: Decent sound quality for the price. Great value. Durable.Cons: Ear pieces seem to fall of fairly easily.I would buy again.
3,Did it's purpose,It worked well. Kind of cheap looking and feeling but I didn't wanna spend a fortune on one for my first level of nursing school.
5,Great for the price,"I am not a medical expert and just bought the stethoscope to listen to my sons chest since he has ""reactive airways"". I have found it them to be quite clear. They feel quite solid as well and come with an extra diaphragm. The earpiece are a bit painful so I would not want to wear them all day long."
5,Excellant stethescope,"excellant product, good quality, not cheap, as good or better than the high dollar competition, but at a lower price."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I am a nursing student and I bought this stethoscope to learn with. It has not served me very well. It is heavy both in my pocket and around my neck. Also, (and more importantly) I cannot hear much with it. Everything is muffled. This is NOT a good stethoscope to learn on. Maybe it is okay for a person with a trained ear. I am personally switching to a Littmann. I need to hear!"
1,Useless,"I ordered this based on all the good reviews. When I received it I tried it out and could only hear heart sounds very faintly. Have definitley used better, clearer, louder stethoscopes before and this one was practically useless."
4,Great Examples,The book has lots of code examples and great documentation on Site Server CE Objects. It is lacking in the features such as ad server and personalization and membership. This is the best book I have found so far on Site Server CE.
3,written in 1999 - not relevant to current Commerce Server,"I almost bought this book, before realizing it was written in 1999, for a version of Commerce Server that is no longer relevant to most of us - if you meet a client running Site Server 3.0, try to talk them into updating at least to Commerce Server 2002!"
5,"A thoughtful, non-linear drama.","This film is thoughtful, engaging, intriguing and mysterious. Debra Winger is both innocent and dangeriously loyal to herself and her friend, Mike. Anyone who has ever tried to save someone they love, or seeks answers to the sudden, tragic loss of that someone, will identify instantly with Winger's character."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I've read in years,"Although the novel is readable and engaging, I was sorry I wasted my time reading it due to the distracting inconsistencies within. Utimately both unbelievable and disappointing, not to mention gratuitiously sensational."
2,What's the point?,"The premise from the back cover of this (paperback) sounded intriguing. I enjoy mysteries, especially those that offer many colorful characters, relationship problems and are of a contemporary setting.The book started out well and had my interest, but after about 100 pages, I had no clue where it was heading. Everything that was happening seemed to move along too frantically and at times, unbelievably. I never felt close to any one of these characters.Jeanne Cross was an exerciser (jogging) yet a pack-a-day smoker. Come on!Her son, overweight, though endearing, still evoked little empathy.The royally messed up lives of others (Ali, Brian, George) had me feeling that each one got what they probably deserved: Ultimately, I did not finish this book, mostly because I just didn't care to know the outcome of these character's lives. Disappointing."
3,not as thrilled as others seem to be,"First, a warning...do not read my review if you have not ALREADY READ THIS BOOK....ok...now that's said...I thought the book was interesting and moved quickly...I did stay up late to finish it, and was surprised by the ending...but I didn't think some parts of the book were very realistic..why would a 16 yr old who is physically larger/stronger than his father not stop the abuse from happening to him? Why wouldn't the son have one day punched the father out when he attempted to abuse him again...I don't get it."
1,"Is the author a ""C"" student in high school?",I can't take another second! After 325 pages into this contrived rubbish I am waving the white flag....I surrender. I have managed to get through some really bad books but I can't make it through this one. Jean is a pathetic character in every relationship. She might be insane or redeemed in the end.....but I don't even care.It's the writing that's killin' me. Empty characters are slightly acceptable in a well-written story. It's so lousy.
5,A+ suspense novel and book club must!,"The Liar's Diary is the best book I've read in ages! Smart, sophisticated suspense with a knock out ending you won't see coming! I've already ordered five copies for friends and can't wait to propose for my book club. Go buy this one -- it delivers!"
4,Chilling Psychological Suspense Novel Provides Non-Stop Excitement,"Liar's abound in this chilling suspense novel, and their web of deception results in devastation and death.Jeanne Cross, a school secretary married to a hotshot doctor, has spent her life portraying the part of the perfect wife and mother, ignoring the way her husband's secret activities are destryoing the life of their 16 year old son, Jamie. Enter 46 year old Ali Mather, a free sprited, seductive musician, whose own secret past allows her valuable insight into the evil that lurks in Jeanne's family. Her struggle to help Jeanne and Jamie face the hard truth about their lives results in chilling psychological suspense and violent death.Francis' characters had me hooked from page one, and I eagerly followed this thrilling roller coaster ride to it's surprising and satisfying conclusion."
5,Dorfmeister's True Calling,"I take nothing away from Peter Kruder, but Richard Dorfmeister was meant to collaborate with Rupert Huber. Their work as Tosca is exceptional, and Suzuki is one of art. I love Opera for it's quirkiness, but nothing beats chilling out to this CD."
4,Heavenly downtempo,"For those of you who gave up on Dorfmeister after the first Tosca effort ""Opera"", I guarantee you'll come back to him after this disc. The hip-hop influence has taken a back seat, and gentle melodies with smooth vocals have come to the fore. The production is highly polished, and the album forms a cohesive whole, with ""Annanas"" and ""Honey"" being standout tracks. Great summer music to usher the twilight in."
5,Totally love this CD,This CD is awesome. Each time I listen to Tosca's Suzuki I hear something new. Makes me so happy !!
3,Next level denied!,While Suzuki promises to be a complete journey it fails to evolve or even devolve and meanders into a bleary replicated backwater. On the upside it works well as a sedatitve.
2,TWO headz are better than one,"...The two headz of Kruder and Dorfmeister that is (Do we really care or know who Huber is?) Like most everyone else here, I bought Suzuki because I loved the K & D Sessions--a magnificient disc, groove heavy, with many many details. I suppose the problem here is that i expected Dorfmeister to be at least 1/2 of K & D. Because of the concept of synergism, I can tell you that D. alone is not even 1/8 the brilliance of K & D. Don't know why that is...but just listen and you can hear the difference. Totally lackluster. I admit there are some good tracks on the CD, hence the two stars; but by comparison they are unoriginal and uninspired beat tracks with a melody here and there. Don't bother."
4,New to me and Great.,"I had never heard of Tosca before Amazon recommended this to me. I was happily surprised. The first half of the CD is highly textured trance using layers of original vocal percussive sounds and wordless spoken syllables on top of solid, balanced harmonies. The music gets progressively more jazzy as the CD goes on moving into a unique acid jazz/bossanova/trance mix. It has great character and rhythm, and importantly excellent dancibility. If you enjoy Underworld, Orbital, and/or acid jazz then try this out."
5,Excellent Disc,"I thought this was a fantastic disc. Nice smooth rhythms, great beats and they all seemed to flow one after another like they were meant to be together as a compilation almost. I really enjoyed this disc, it had a great style and tempo. I highly recommend this disc."
5,Another gem from G-Stoned,"Solid album! Every track is unique and worthy in its own way. If you are a fan of the G-Stoned label, you won't be dissapointed. Outstanding!"
5,Techno Terrific,"This CD was my introduction to techno music. I love it! This CD is not only soothing, but stimulating (can you believe it), and relaxing. Great make-out music.I will purchase Opera.Job well done, Suzuki, keep 'em coming."
1,Heath Zenith 715w-1,"I had 4 of them. This doorbell push button on sun light site has working for 1 year, then wht button braked, and light out. Do not buy it !"
3,interesting,My husband has read this book and decided to give it to various friends..He really enjoyed it. He felt it really gave a good history of the state and the times.
5,Two Big Thumbs Up!,I can't really add anything that hasn't been mention in the reviews above other than this is the most enjoyable book I've read in a long time.
4,Big Variety of Different Music,"This cd has got every kind of music that they would play in stadiums or arenas around the country. It has rock,rap,techno,and a lot of mixes of songs. It also features some big hit songs. The reason why I gave it a 4 star rating is because it does have some rap,which I'm not into, but its a great album to get pumped up for a sporting event."
5,One Hell of a CD,A rock-jock compilation to top all others...rap edge tightens up the tracks. One rollicking good time.
2,Game Time,Would have preferred to hear samples of each track before purchasing rather than seeing only a list of song titles.
4,A Sweet Sound Resounds From Bay Area Septet,"Without practically any publicity aside from word of mouth, these acoustic masters from Northern California, produce a wonderful groove remindful of modern day troubadour Keller Williams, but with a much smoother sound. Hopefully with this most recent edition to their catalog Calobo will gain the recognition they deserve."
5,A Great State Reptile Book,"Excellent maps, photographs and text. Uses taxonomy current at the time (early 1990s) and uses common names standardized since 1978. The authors provide a wealth of information about the turtles and reptiles native to North Carolina. A must buy for anyone living along the east coast, and any herpetologist or naturalist interested in North American herpetology."
2,Tripe,Most of this is tripe...not particularly insightful. I find the interview questions pandering to the egos of the artists.
3,"You won't see any ""images"" in this book...","224 (only 202 without the bibliography) pages and only 1 ""image"" inside. I expected this book to have pictures. There is one on the cover and one on the second page (and it isn't a good one). For close to thirty six dollars (regular selling price-not inflated because it is a rare book) I expected more. The stories do look interesting. I would not have bought this if I had more carefully researched the book. Just an FYI for those who come looking for pictures. There are many other books that discuss the Italian immigrant experience for much less."
4,Better than nothing,"For those wishing to successfully keep Killifish and not having had exposure to these fish before, this book will be most informative and helpful. The basic guidelines are provided and a fair number are discussed that would provide the beginner with a good grounding.With the lack of literature on these particular fish, this book may prove to be informative and helpful even for those having kept these fish before and the ""experts""."
1,The worst book I've read in three years...,"If you like reading each paragraph twice due to incoherent, sophomoric writing...you'll like this book."
2,The Pickup is a let down!,"Don't get me wrong - I am a fan of Nadine Gordimer (see my review of `The House Gun'). But sadly `The Pickup' is a let-down!The story of an affluent white girl falling in love with a black (illegal) immigrant car-mechanic is so utterly implausible that, even as it unfolds, the reader is hit by a sense of disbelief.Still being a fan of Nadine, I persisted.However fifty grueling pages later when the girl - who apparently lacks for nothing, brings her black, slum-dweller, boy-friend to meet white, upper-crust South African society at her parents party ... I conceded to common sense and cast the book aside.If you haven't already bought the book, reach for another title!"
1,This author fails English 101,"I didn't mind the lack of quotation marks for dialog, but I don't forgive the many poorly structured sentences that I could not decipher. The editor failed to do his job. Other than that, she tells a good story about life in a desert Arab town, until the ending, which I found unbelievable."
3,Book Received late,"I haven't had a chance to read the book. It arrived almost a month after I ordered it. I ordered it to read with my book club, but it arrived too late for me to read. I'll read it later."
2,Overrated writer,"Looks like I'm the second reader from the small town of Los Osos, CA who was underwhelmed with this book. I didn't appreciate the choppy style of writing which seemed more laziness than intentional craft. Also found the premise more than a little difficult to swallow."
2,Nobel Prize winner?,"Am I missing something here? While I was intrigued by the premise of the novel, I was distracted by the poor writing: the annoying shorthand style and the numerous grammatical errors. Is this woman such a 'great' writer that no single word can be edited?"
5,fast and accurate,"This is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape, grounded firmly in love and faithfulness. It moves quickly; I was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant. The grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of Julie and Abu. And it is not transient but deepens. Miriam, Abu's sister, remains with me in her moving quietude, and the litle girl Lela, hand in hand with Julie, plucks deep."
3,Book club selection,"This is a tough book to review. The first half of the book is slow and sometimes you lose interest but, the second half is very revealing about the man and the woman and how their feelings about what they each want out of life.This is our book club book for the month so will have a better idea after our discussion."
3,Syntax bothered me,"I'd never read Gordimer before but must say, I expected more. My read was from a Kindle edition and I wondered if the conversion process had screwed up the syntax, but I gather from other reviews this word placement can't be blamed on electronics.The story started out well enough and I was able to tolerate the protagonist even though some of the plot design seemed contrived which along with the ending somehow just did not ring true. Sorry Nadine, don't think it was a great success, but I will try one of your other novels anyway just because I don't like making decisions based on one example."
3,Very insightful ...,"After reading the first few pages of ""The Pickup"", I was determined to reach it's conclusion. The story unfolds of two personalities that are as different as night and day. Here are two people who see the intimate workings of the world through two distinct sets of senses and whose common threads, rather than intertwine with each other's realities, run directly parallel to one another. Theirs is the story of two people who are using one another to fill a void that neither can fill because they are not grounded in the present with an eye toward the future but instead are reliving the past through each other, trying to circumvent the truths that eventually bring them to an awakening of what they are looking for in life. It's an insightful treatment of diversity in relationships that are more about codependency than they are about love."
5,No Regrets,"I've been reading self help books for 25 years but this one is the one that changed my life. The stories combined with practical tools and exercises helped me to make the changes I've wanted to make forever, but simply couldn't until this book.I've always tried to be what you OTHERS wanted me to be. That is a lot of work, and not very satisfying. The *Questions Worth Asking* were wonderful. The one that really made me stop and think was: When I'm 80, what will I regret having done or not done? My answer, which shocked me -- was to dance. So, at the magic age of 45, I started salsa classes, and I'm having the time of my life!This book taught me how to be fearless and how to live my dreams. Thank you, Stephanie!"
5,Same book as 'Predicting',"This is the exact same book as his other title ""Predicting Love, Marriage, Sex and Money"". I'm not sure why there are two different titles for the same book."
3,"An interesting book gets very, very strange.","Mero's book is an interesting read, and is a very good non-mathematical review of the basics of game theory and its relationship to human ethics. I suspect that its translation from Hungarian led to its sometimes strange choices of words, but on the whole, it is a good way to get a sense of the surprising generality and importance of the subject.Unfortunately, the book is marred by Mero's expansion of game theory into a ""theory of everything"". By the last chapter, he has gone from straightforward applied mathematics into fuzzy-headed mysticism. At this point, the book has become more embarassing than interesting. My suggestion is to read the first half of tbe book and forget the rest!"
5,Terri Anytime!,"Well, I've been a long time fan of Terri, and was thrilled when I found out that she would be releasing a home video collection! When the tape arrived at my home, I sat through the entire the tape mesmerized! Terri is so passionate about her music that it's inspiring! There's so much raw emotion, and honesty in her music and her voice. When you hear her sing, you just know that is's real, and you don't see that very much. If you're a Terri Clark fan, this video collection is a MUST have!"
5,better things to do,"This is an awesome video, I just love the Terri kicks ass. Terri has a very unique style and ways of telling us exactly how she really does feel. You go-girl."
5,One of the Greats,"I rate Terri up there w/ the greats such as Reba, Loretta, Tammy, Dolly, Kitty, etc. This is a great collection of videos and she definitely gives you your money's worth!"
5,Melody in Medley,"A little jazzy (check out the medley of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer), a little romantic (Silent Night), and a little sweet lullabye (Oh Holy Night). All of it is filled with soul... with a little bit of country. Gary Chapman's distinguishing vocals give the perfect blend of yule-tide warmth."
4,Good but hope you aren't allergic...,Be careful if you have an allergy to Ragweed. This cleanser has chamomile extract which is in the same family as ragweed. Made my face itchy and red. Other than that I liked the product.
5,Worth the Wait!,"This is a great comic book. The story about the snow goons was hilarious. I always laugh at the fantastic duo's wit, intelligence, and friendship. I throughly enjoyed reading and smiling with this. Hope you enjoy it when you buy it!"
4,Great book But not The Best,"This was a Great book, non stop Laughs and fun for toilet reading :), Honestly though, My favorite Calvin and Hobbes has to be ""Something under the Bed is Drooling"" which I also Highly Recommend. But Dont let that stop you from Buying, this is a great book."
3,Misleading title but good old Calvin + Hobbes,"We were under the impression this was going to contain 100% snowman illustrations, so were slightly disappointed upon seeing that that was clearly not the case.But Calvin is a great cartoon and helps engage a parent and child in conversation and having a good laugh together..."
3,For Calvin fans ONLY!,"I thought this one was a little too...................dumb. It wasn't really THAT funny, but sometimes it was. Weaknesses: 1)No Color 2)Not Overly Funny 3)Worst C+H yet Good parts: 1)Nice Cover! 2)Some good cartoons 3)When it ends"
3,Good Clean Fun,"""Oh, great altar of passive entertainment...bestow upon me thy discordant images at such speed as to render linear thought impossible!"" - Calvin.Oh, yeah. Good clean fun."
2,There are better manuals for Saab,"While I can certainly appreciate the effort that goes into researching repair manuals, the Chilton books for Saab are too general to be used as anything but backup for other manuals. For the 99, the best choice is the factory Service Manual (#0314948 - very difficult to locate) followed closely by Haynes (#247 US)."
5,A Wife Pleaser!!,"I bought, ""You Caught Me Kissing: A Love Story""by Dorothy Bridges, for my wife as a Christmas present... She loves the book! It's well written, funny, and romantic! Great for anyone who likes Biographies or Personal-Interest type books. She has already read it several times!"
1,"Turgid, a book of little consequence",This book attempts to prove what everyone already knows. Fones Wolf proves she has no depth and no real understanding of Twentieth century cultural and intellectual history. Her book is pitched toward the lamest of knee jerk liberals.
3,"Good product, but....","The company did not indicate that the book was coming from the UK, so it took a very long time to arrive (complicated by winter weather). I looked specifically for a domestic site to order the book from. They should have indicated that it was coming from overseas."
5,Wonderful tale of a common man doing extraordinary things.,"Keith Stewart lives quietly in suburban London, working free-lance for a model mechanic magazine. His sister and brother in law have him hide a jewel box aboard their sailboat just before they emigrate to Vancouver. But when the ship goes down in the South Pacific with them both, Keith must not only raise their young daughter, but must seek to retrieve the jewel box from the wreck.Keith has never before left Britain, and is very much a fish out of water. But there's not that much suspense to this story, as he finds that many people who have read of his work are delighted to help him along.All the same, it isn't an easy trip for Keith, but it is a far easier one for the reader, with a fine read and memorable characters."
5,Super-Refined Ska,"Wanna hear what 3rd Wave is all about? Get this CD. SUPER SUPER catchy horn parts, way fast guitar, excellent basslines, and catchy lyrics make this an excellent CD. I actually convinced my brother to buy this CD for me...Hehe, stupid brother. Anyway, it's good. Buy it."
5,"Tightest, fastest, catchiest ska ever","I've got all the CD's including LTJ, RBF, Musturd Plug, MU330, Aquabats, Hippo's etc and while I love them all I have to say that Keasbey Nights by Catch 22 is the most superbly tight and skankin ska out there."
5,EGAN RULES!!!!!!,"I don't know why I haven't written a review of this until now; this is such a great album and Egan is frickin' amazing and such a cool guy (I should know, he taught me trombone). This is simply the best ska album ever recorded. The songs never get old and the horn parts are insane (Egan rules). Everyone MUST buy this album."
5,The Greatest,"It is, of course, the greatest. Looking at these reviews, how could you think otherwise? Catch 22: Keasbey Nights is still laying in my cd player, months after purchase. This cd is wonderful, GO BUY IT."
5,Possibly the best ska album ever!,"Catch 22 is one of the best ska bands ever. This whole entire album is a non-stop thrill. From such songs as Hey Sergio to 9mm and a Three Piece suit, the whole album rocks. My fav. tracks on the album are 9mm, Keasby Nights, and On & On & On. Also, if you have a chance to catch them live, they are unbelievable! This is deifinately an album you shouldn't miss."
4,Above Average,"I don't like ska, but I love this album. Melodic yet edgy at times, it's an album that can be listened to straight through."
5,"Less punk than ska, but it still ROCKS","This CD is so good. I've seen them twice already and this CD gives me such great memories from those shows. Even though this is pretty much all ska (excluding 12341234 and a couple others) it's still very good. Washed Up is also a good EP of theirs, but first get this so you can hear them in their totally ska style. BUY IT."
2,Give the guys credit for being popular,"I hate to say, but listening to this CD, i don't hear anything that hasn't really been done before by some other ska band that is just starting out. It reminds me too much of the Skolars (aka, Telegraph). When i heard ""9mm and a three piece suit"" back on Skarmageddon 4 (Moon SKA NYC, RIP) I thought, ""wow, these guys are reall fast."" and that's pretty much it. The only difference is that most bands that put out music like this didn't last more than a year together. At least this band has stuck together, to carry the banner for every other band that broke up after high school.To me, Catch 22 is like cramming the popular ska songs of other earlier bands into one little nugget of mad-tempo skankin, song after song. But who cares? You could go out and buy any number of other bands' CDs and get the same effect. Pass on this and just learn you ska history."
4,A Great ska album,"Catch 22 really got me into ska with this album. It melodic, fast paced yet slow and groovy at times. The songs are just plain fun. I can't listen to this album without singing at the top of my lungs. Its a must have for any ska fan."
5,"Keasbey Nights, the Best Catch 22 Album","This is the best album Catch 22 ever made.And as far as Cesana is concerned, I'm not sure what her problem is.This is top-notch 3rd Wave ska. I'm not sure what she was looking for.Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, and all those other party-ska bands don't have a THING on Catch 22.Catch 22 has the fast tempos, loud horns, and catchy(heh) rythms that separate the great ska from the mediocre.Keasbey Nights gets a ""best ska album"" nomination, easy.If you like Catch 22, you'll love Streetlight Manifesto, too. Check 'em out."
3,A solid SKA choice.,"This one album was a harder-to-find one. On the precedent that what is rare is best doesn't quite apply in this circumstance. After reading some of the other reviews for this CD, I was expectant. And while they do have a few catchy tunes, I was more-or-less dissappointed. They have solid acoustics and horns, but their best song ""Christina"" was a spoiler for me seeing as how my sister's name happens to be as such. Their terribly fast tempos and almost incoherent lyrics at some times turned me off. Mustard Plug is certainly a better choice, and perhaps the pinnacle of ska, along with Planet Smashers. I would recommend this to the hardcore addicts of ska, but for those with high expectations, think twice before you shell out the money for this one."
1,Not readable,"I love George MacDonald, but this is not readable and in old ""something"". I wanted the translated books and should have gotten a sample first."
5,What I ordered,It was a download and it came tom my device quickly. That's all I can say. 11 words is so unnecessary when there isn't much to say.
1,I could never use this item,It doesn't work in any of the karaoke systems I have neither in the computer. It was a waste of my money.
3,"A useful work, but full of gaps and inconsistencies.","This book goes a fair way toward fulfilling the crying need for a dictionary of Spanish dialects. It contains much useful information. I have not been able to detect any outrageously inaccurate information, which is quite an accomplishment in a field noted hitherto for the abysmal quality of its production.Nonetheless, this dictionary leaves much to be desired, since it contains many gaps and inconsistencies. In the first place, in the English-to-Spanish section, the Spanish equivalents are given only for some countries, not for all. To make up for this, the authors introduce the concept of ""principal term"", which they leave undefined, but which presumably is the term used in the countries whose Spanish equivalents are not listed individually. However, the ""principal term"" they list is often incorrect for some countries."
1,More frustration!,"I'm referring, of course, to there not being a 0 star rating. This is without a doubt the most useless, inaccurate, and misleading publication I have ever seen. Why? Well, each entry is followed by translations that are wrong or misspelled or committing some other dictionary-destroying information. To the dictionaries credit I did find that it was about 8% accurate. I calculated this by adding up all the entries (a rather limited and useless compendium of words to begin with) and determined from various sources which were accurate and which were not. About 8 in 100 fit the bill, meaning that 92% of the dictionary is just plain wrong! Since the author does not have the courtesy to point out which entries are properly handled, it leaves you looking like a sucker after buying this book. Do yourself a favor and keep clear of this book. Please keep way clear if you want any chance of learning any Spanish."
1,Great film - Parts missing due to censorship!,I agree with all the reviews before but one thing really makes me angry: in the version i bought here 5 minutes are missing. I watched this film in the german television and I know what they cut out! It's really hilarious!!! I suggest anybody else to look for the original version!
4,Lost In Translation,"all the reviews i have read on amazon have left me extremly confused they are all one of two extremes: they either review the film as awful or excellent. i would definetly put this film in the 2nd catergory.bill murray is excellent as bob and scarlett johansson makes a good charlotte. the camerawork when around tokyo is a bit dodgy (but good considering they used a handcamera). the film does not exactly have a storyline, but this does not stop it from being a good film. bob and charlotte are just two people trying to find out who they are and what they should do with their lifes.the film has some very funny parts, and is very enjoyable."
4,"strong, well-made, worth the watch (but not for everybody)","I really enjoy this film, but it is definitely not for everyone. I'm noticing that many of the other reviewers found the film boring, didn't get it, or simply feel that watching a film that imitates (or attempts to imitate) life just isn't worth the time. The dynamic between Scarlett Johannsen and Bill Murray is really beautiful to watch - one of the sweetest and least conventional love stories I've seen in a long time, actually. This film isn't about sex or action or sitting braindead in your seat waiting to be entertained, so if you enjoy movies as a Hollywood escape from reality, look elsewhere. This movie is about being lost and down and connecting with people who are also trying to dig themselves out of a hole. Sound boring? Stay away. Sound familiar? You'll like it."
3,Bored out of my mind,"I usually enjoy snail pace movies with minimal dialogue and long periods of ""meaningful"" silence, yet this movie was somehow... dry. And SLOW to the point of being irritating. Granted, there were a few gems (electric curtain scene in the morning, low shower nozzle, ad production scene, etc), but the rest wandered off and formed an incoherent jumble of garish colours, neon lights, night clubs and bad karaoke. Even the dialogue was disappointing, especially for an art movie (""life is hard... but it gets easier... marriage is hard too... one day you'll find yourself"" - semi-direct quotes). One word about Murray's performance though: phenomenal."
2,LOST IN THE SCREENPLAY,"The film certainly creates - in a convincing way - the atmosphere that would make it difficult for an uninspired foreigner on a short stay in Tokyo to be anything but bored. Unfortunately the proliferation of simple sentences made up of simple words in the screenplay not only made it boring for this viewer but also failed to convince me that any meaningful relationship could develop between the young wife (Johansson) and the older actor (Murray). The screenplay was unable to lift the film above the level of the ""elevator"" music that anaesthetized the patrons of the hotel bar. I gave it 2 stars for atmosphere and the film work. The non-plot and non-acting was worth a big fat zero.This DVD is not worth owning or renting."
2,If you watch movies to escape - skip this one!,"Okay, I'm getting tired of all of these artsy-fartsy ""day in the life"" movies. I'm frustrated that after watching LOST IN TRANSLATION I will never get back the 2 hours of my life I gave away. If you like movies without any real point, this is for you. If you like to see your favorite comedic actors in dramatic roles, this is for you.Bill Murray is not only NOT FUNNY in this movie, he's downright boring. The jokes that are in the film are rehashed from years ago - like when the director of the commercial talks for 2 minutes straight and the translator tells Murray ""He want more passion."" Murray - ""That's it? That's all he said?""That was the funniest part of the whole movie.Skip this turkey."
2,Not as I expected,"I've lived in ""foreign"" lands all my life. There is no excuse for Hollywood Romantic ""interludes"". I followed my wedding vows - I felt they were important, thus didn't like the whining and the "" feel good "" aspects of the story line. Both protagonists were despicable to me. I am a reasonable man, but dislike the tone of ""rationality"" which seems to permiate our culture - especially in this film, which was not funny in the least."
2,The longest 90 minutes I ever spent in a movie theatre,"I love Bill Murray and his deadpan delivery and he is terrific in this film. And Scarlett is very good, too. However I don't understand all the fuss about this film. Yes, I know the characters were bored and lonely and I guess the director wanted us to feel their boredom, too. Well, she did a great job of conveying that feeling because I was bored to tears. The photography was ugly (for some strange reason the photography looked better on TV ads. But in the theatre on a big screen the film looked under exposured with flat colors). You would think since these characters were so bored and lonely they would go out and find something interesting to do. Nope. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Is Bill and Scarlett attracted to each other or not? It's not that I wanted them to have some predictable affair I just wanted to understand what was it they found so appealing in each other. Sorry, I wanted to like this film."
5,Magical,"Visually beautiful, a great story and Bill Murrays best performance to date. Easily the best movie of 2003."
1,The first movie I felt I needed to watch in fastforward.,"This has to be the most unbelievable and boring movie ever! I have spent time in Japan and was never able to complete 10% of what I wanted to do. Here we have two people who can find nothing interesting in all of Japan. They are just two people who are depressed with their lives and we are forced to suffer with them. I could not care less how depressed they are with their lives. The only thing I was waiting for throughout the movie and sadly never happened was for them to both jump from their hotel windows killing themselves. I am most thankful that I only rented this movie, so I am only out 2 Euros for this bomb. Why, oh why can we not select 0 stars???"
1,tedious,"This is perhaps one of the most tedious, mind-numbing films I've ever seen. Can't imagine what all the hype was about. Don't waste your money or your time. It is dull, slow, and has no redeeming features beyond a tawdry view of Tokyo nightlife."
2,Boooorrrrrrrrring,"Bill, please get back to doing movies like Stripes! I have no clue what the academy saw in this movie (they must be 60+ in age).. If this movie was on in the Dentist office I would recommend the Musak machine instead."
2,Really slow...,"Let me start by saying I love Bill Murray and I thought he did an excellent job in a REALLY SLOW movie. Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to show us how boring and sad some people's lives are, if that was the intent, then the film was a success. I kept waiting on something interesting or exciting to happen, and before I knew it the film was over. If you are really bored, and want to see a film about someone's life that is worst than yours, then this is your movie."
2,"Superb? Oh, come on!","This movie was boring, almost beyond belief. The woman I saw it with kept nodding off, and when we left the theater she asked, ""Did we go to the right movie? Was that the movie all of the critics were raving about?"" She had it right, even though she snoozed through about a quarter of the film.Murray almost saves it with about ten minutes to go, by putting in a strong final show of his innate acting ability. The problem is though that the movie is so painfully slow up to that point, that it cannot be saved, ultimately. I would pass this one by."
1,haha... 5 stars? you're kidding right?,"WOW! i'm sorry, but did i miss something here? This movie was horrible. A normal movie lover, i was bored out of my mind tossing and turning staring at my wall, pausing to go to the bathroom, running downstairs for some food... even fell asleep once. what a waste of the $15.00 i paid for it. maybe im missing something but this cheepo shot in tokyo looks like it cost $200 to make, and was a pointless movie. all in favor that johnny should have won the Acadamy award instead say Aye..."
3,Lost,"This movie is about isolation in the world, of how you're constantly surrounded by people yet there is nothing more lonely and how two people, Bob and Charlotte, are lost in a period of their lives. Bob is an aging actor, having a mid-life crisis and Charlotte has freshly graduated with no aim in life. In their isolated states, they find each other in the most unlikely place, Japan, for comfort and the strength to carry on.However, I do think that the movie tries too hard in portraying its artistic values with the long periods of silence and very little terse dialogue. It's slow-moving and besides, the idea of isolation isn't original. Other people have expressed it in better ways."
2,"visually nice, weak otherwise","mainly this has to do with the locations and in even worse case the whole seems to boggle into a travelog. There really isnt much here. there isnt a storyline to speak of and the pace is the slowest ive ever seen. Bill Murrary has a few funny lines and his performance is understated but too much of the movie is spent in silence. Scarrlett johansen is ok as the love interest. The movie seems far to concered with visuals and making the location Japan itself more the focus as if it were a charachter, i couldnt help myself but lose interest.it also doesnt help the movie seems over self indulgent and disconnected. The movie goes nowhere and ends the same way.the movie had the potential of giving Bill Murrary something to do but instead it focus' less on the charachters and more on the art school visual que's. For me its all mostly about the charachters and plot. this one seems lacking in both"
2,COMPLETELY LOST on this film...,"Folks, I don't own this dvd, but I recently rented it. I have to say it did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, I normally LOVE Bill Murray, but somehow I think this is not one of his better storylines. Blah, very. Or maybe it just wasn't my style? Try it out and see if you agree."
2,"Sadly, Opens with Mandatory Commercials","This is a touching, understated film deserving four stars, but on DVD it opens with a long set of mandatory commercials -- the Menu function is disabled so you must watch the commercials before you can watch the movie. It's hard to recommend purchasing a product that forces you to watch advertising, and I can't give it more than two stars.I believe Amazon should inform people when a DVD contains mandatory advertising."
1,I'll never get that time (or money) back,"This movie had a little bit of humor, but overall, I was anything but amused. I don't understand what the big deal is about a movie of two bored people who never really get ""unbored"". They bored me. I kept wondering when this movie would take off...reminded me of seeing ""A Thin Red Line"" or ""Ghost World"" - just boring. I won't ever get that time back that I lost watching this film (or the money)."
5,Mirrors,"One reviewer said it well. ""Lost in Translation"" is a mirror for those who see it. When I see words such as ""ignorant"", ""racist"", ""boring"" bandied about here they seem to me to reflect directly on the reviewer. When I see others who view it with intelligence, subtlety, passion, and interest, they seem to convey the same properties. All of these are in the movie. And the look at people's foibles (both American and Japanese) is affectionate throughout.The concept of favoritism towards the Coppola name is laughable. There's a reason why her father is concentrating on making wine and not getting the budget for movies. A LOT of people could get together a $4million budget to make a film like this. Whether they'd have the talent is another issue."
5,Beautiful movie,"I think this movie deserved every bit of hype it received. Last year's abundance of comic book movies and Matrix sequels really turned me off. This movie brought together two characters with much in common though at different stages of their lives/marriages and avoided all unhappy marriage/lonely character clichés. The beauty of this movie lies in what doesn't happen.Most people I know who didn't like this movie were expecting a Bill Murray ""comedy"". It is, but not in the obvious ways. It is so much more. Murray and Scarlett Johansen were perfectly cast - I could not imagine any other actors playing these parts."
2,Please go out watch more movies,"For those who ""got"" this movie, I initially wonder what one has to smoke to like this one? Then I realize they actually have not smoked enough, not seen enough movies so to say.I've read previous reviews of both sides... those who can see what this movie really is - ball of nothing, are the type who typically watched lots of movies, esp. independent and foreign. On the contrary, those who love this movie are the ones probably not seen enough movies.So you go figure.Then another fellow reviewer is probably right: do yourself a favor, go out and watch more movies. After you watch 50 of top-notch independent movies, come back to ""lost in translation"", you probably get lost too...Well the thing is you may not hear other indes as much since they probably don't have such strong marketing/publicity as ""lost in translation"" or not that many wooing critics (God knows what they wooing for) to start with."
1,Completely lost,"You have to watch this movie without expecting it to go anywhere and then you might be able to appreciate the interesting cinematography and subtlties of expression in the actors. I didn't know that when I watched it and I kept waiting for something to happen. The movie is also hard on Bill Murray's character's wife--making it seem that she isn't justified in calling him and telling him he should be at home. He should be at home. His wife is right. He might be less depressed and lost if he went home, instead of staying away longer than he needs to and swooning over a girl half his age who is married to someone else. Speaking of Scarlett Johansson, her character comes on a business trip with her husband and then acts hurt that he's not spending more time with her. This movie caters to all the selfishness in people and makes it seem justifiable and right. Good camera work, though."
4,The loneliness of being in a strange place,Bill Murray and Scarlatt Johansen are stuck in a foreign country with no understanding of the language and feel left behind.
3,Blah,"I love Bill Murray, particularly in one of my all-time favorites, ""Groundhog Day"" (quoted approvingly by Roger Ebert as ""one of the most spiritual films of our times""). He does a great job, as does his opposite, Scarlett Johansson. Sophie Coppola's direction was outstanding. But the movie didn't *do* enough to capture the attention of my MTV-addled mind. Yes, the characters were well-drawn and believable -- but to what end?"
3,Not bad but...,"This is interesting, I'm sure those who are put off by traditional Hollywood productions, which do get old, will love this. I might be crude but I found it a bit too subtle.Chatlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson was a charming character, someone you wish you could be best friends with, but she still looks the 19 years old girl she is. She does not look like the 25 year old married woman she plays.During the whole movie all you can think about is, will Bill Murray and Johansson hook up, will they? Well, Dont hold your breath buddy...This love story might really need some simple translation, into human terms, because it's just too subtle. I felt like i needed a microscope or a giger couter to get in on the action.This was a nice movie, really. But I doubt I'd watch it again."
1,"Someone Shoot Me!, Please!!!","If I could have the 2 hours back I spent watching this movie, I would rather have spent my time licking my own ass or get beat over the head with a baseball bat! It was Long, Drawn out, and boring. Not once did I attempt to laugh, it would have hurt too much. The ""Artiness"" of the movie was nonexistent. It was crude toward Japan. Mocking them many times and showed them as boring and crazy. I would recommend that you take a boxing glove put it on and pound your head before you glance at this movie!"
1,I don't get all the hype,"I didn't get it. This movie received all this hype and I was excited to see it. Boy was I disapointed, this movie had no point, no ending, no meaning. The story is old man meets young girl, old man and young girl party, old man leaves. That's it. Nothing happens. Save 2 hours of your life and pass on this movie."
1,This movie is an insult!!!,This movie is boring and stupid. Don't buy this DVD or rent the movie. I can tell you right here everything that happens in the movie so save your money. Bill Murray goes to Japan to film a commercial for a local whiskey. He is bored and meets the wife of a photographer who is also bored. They go together to a few stupid places and develop some platonic relationship. In the end he leaves to the U.S. and she stays in Japan. The end. Sucks huh? I can only say that this movie was done becuse of the Coppola name behind it. If some unknown would have written this junk they would have been laughed at.
1,I Cannot believe this movie is up for Best!!!,"I ask you this, if you were in a far away place, FREE would you be sulking in your hotel room!!!. Was there nothing this beautiful land had to offer except a trip to a strip joint?? I think these people were depressed. What ever it was it was not worthy of 2 hours of a bad reality show of a business trip. I asked people who say they loved it to describe to me WHY they did and WHAT it was about and no one really knows. I think it is a case of ""lets just hop on the band wagon"". A great injustice to truly great writers directors and actors. I dont think this took much talent at all."
1,"Pleeeze, Bill Murray is NOT funny","Bill Murray cannot be considered a comic, this man is not, has never been and will never be funny. OK, so you insist he is funny? Did anybody see the David Letterman interview with Ms Coppola? She brought in a tape of Murray doing some kind of dance, was that supposed to be funny? I didn't find it even slightly humorous. Murray sucks as a comic."
2,"Conventional, Superficial","Admittedly I went into this film with high expectations: I had heard it was quite good. But the film provides at best a superficial glimpse of its characters, who in turn exhibit barely more depth than those around them."
3,Touching but a bit boring.,Fine but over hyped comedy that is good if you are looking for something different but boring if you don't expect it. Bill Murray is fine in his role but the movie just drags along to its end. Worth a look but don't expect the great movie that some made it out to be.
1,Just plain boring,"This movie is one gigantic snoozer. It is not humorous, the characters evoke no emotion and the plot is nonexistent. So many critics are so willing to sing its praises because they do not want to admit that anything from someone named Coppola could be such a failure as a film. There are thousands of talented young directors and screenwriters out there trying to sell their skills and this piece of junk gets a big studio release just because the baby from the Godfather directed it. This is simple injustice. The Academy and the critics need to put their eyeballs back into their heads and take them out of the nether regions of their bodies. This movie is not ""a classic."" Nor is it ""one for the ages."" It is also not ""visually stunning"" or ""revolutionary"" or even plain ""good."" It is an example of how a bad movie by a bad director can cheat its way into positive acclaim through family connections and condescending critics."
1,Patrick Dempsey would have been better,in the lead. He is closer to the girl's age and mush more handsome then the pocked marked Murray.
1,"Daddy, I want to direct a movie!!!","PLease, Daddy!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! WAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! I want to make fun of Japanese people and feature main characters that are so obnoxiously spoiled and self obsorbed, I could relate to them! DADDY!!!!! WAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!And I want an Oscar for screenwriting an improvised movie...Thank you, Daddy. (Did you make them an offer they couldn't refuse?)"
2,A movie about nothing,"You know how Seinfeld is a show about nothing? Take out all the funny jokes and witty banter. Next, take out any personal conflicts. Then take out interesting ironies or coincidences. Have it set in Japan and you have Lost in Translation.It gets two stars for the good cinematography and music, but that's about it."
1,forced commericals and corporate greed,"This DVD opens with about 5 minutes of commercials which cannot be skipped; although you can fast-forward, this still takes time. This movie grossed 44.5 million at the box office (USA alone, on a budget of 4 million), the DVD retails at $15, yet the corporate honchos are so greedy that they have to include DVD commercials even when people are buying the DVD. The movie is mildly entertaining, but not worth seeing more than once. I recommend checking it out from your local library."
2,Misdescribed Japan,"As a native Japanese, I would say this movie misdescribed Japan.They way it described Japanese culture was very inappropriate and I felt it was rather racist. We do have a very eccentric pop culture in Japan, but that is not all we have. Japan is not only sushi, samurai and stupid TV shows. The movie put too much forcus on describing the silly part of Japan and not on the other part. I guess that's because it is based on Bob's view of Japan only, but how many people who saw the movie would actually realize it?The message I got from the movie was that there is no understanding between American and Japanese culture. The American people in the movie did not even mix with any Japanese, and all they thought was that Japanese can't speak English, which is pretty natural, and they made fun of it.It made me really sad."
2,lost in a hotel,"My trip to Japan last summer was awesome. The food was great, ppl were nice, and the places were beautiful. What about the country seen through the eyes of these people in the movie? It seems so boring and freaky. hmmmm let's see... maybe it's cuz THEY NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO LEAVE THAT STUFFY HOTEL! This movie portrays a lot of idiots in real life who waste money to travel abroad but instead of experiencing the culture and learning the language, they create an artificial environment resembling their home and hide in it. no wonder they feel isolated. duh!"
2,Don't blame the translation,"This is ultimately a fairly objectionable movie. It offers vacuousness poorly disguised as profundity, and stereotype poorly disguised as cultural commentary. The characters may be realistic in their emptiness, but I doubt this was the filmmakers' ultimate intention. The title itself seems to try to offer an excuse for the film's vacuousness (an excuse that seemed to pay off in terms of popular and critical praise).The film is not exactly boring, since it does keep you waiting for some insight or emotional pull, which is unfortunately never forthcoming. Scarlett Johansson is cute as hell, though, and the acting generally is quite OK."
1,short review,"i don't have much to say about this. i fell asleep 20 minutes through it. i'm not sure what happend in those 20 minutes, due to the fact that it was flat out UNINTERESTING.and that's it."
1,Wow that was boring....,This movie was boring and lacked anything interesting. Hi points in the movie were people smoking. Every exciting...Many made for tv movie are better made. Just about anything is better than this one.
1,"Ugh,....","pretentious garbage. I would rather watch a root canal performed on a baby, and I love kids."
1,Save your money!!!,"I am mad at myself for pay per viewing this movie for $3.95!!!!Nice concept, no plot. If you have trouble sleeping, then just watch the movie. You will be asleep in no time!!!"
4,ONE PROBLEM,I am getting tired of DVD's that force coming attractions on you. I don't mind if they are on the dvd as long as you can skip past them.This dvd won't allow you to skip past about 4 comercials. You have to Fast forward through them every time you put the dvd in. Shame on them
5,"Excellent service, amazing movie","The service was quick and the movie came in great condition. For my price paid, it was a steal. I defiantely recommend this vendor ."
3,Interesting...,"If you want to capture my outlook on this movie, here's what you have to do. First, have everybody tell you it is the cinematic achievement of the century. Second, have everybody tell you it is a stirring encapsulation of the contemporary human condition. Third, watch ""Rabbit Proof Fence"". Then, after you've come to terms with what legitimate hardships forced upon people look like, it will be time to reflect on ""Lost in Translation"". Hmmm. How much do you care that rich, white people feel lonely and misunderstood? Are you riveted by their boredom, self-obsession, and deep yearning for novelty? Perfect. Give it five stars. Personally, I found it ironic that this movie might have been the very cure for insomnia that they were looking for.I give it three stars for visual originality, length, and the subtle ending - defying formulaic convention until the very end."
4,A great movie about loneliness.,"Lost in Translation is not your average movie. It's more of a thinking comedy about people trying to connect in a city that is hard to fit in with. Sofia Coppola does a great job with the majesty of Tokyo but also shows the way people can get lost in it's huge tapestry of culture. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are great as the two lonely people trying to connect with themselves and the outside world, and we, the viewer are taking though this journey with them and are intrigued with their misadventures together.It worth the word of mouth that it's getting, and I hope Bill Murray gets the Oscar because he is that good in it."
1,What a wierdo,I have checked back and it does appear that some guy is writing like a dozen 5 star reviews one after another. Take them out and you have like 8 one star reviews out of every ten reviews. I wonder if some flack has invaded this normally open and honest forum.
1,Suspicious of the recent 5 star reviews,"I have noticed several 5 star reviews all from ""A viewer from USA"", this seems like quite a coincidence that with such a rash of 1 star reviews we have a spate of 5 or 6 perfect reviews all from people with the same description. It is a shame that the few who actually liked this film have to resort to in essence stuffing the ballot box in order to keep the score inflated. There are many poeple who reply on these ratings before deciding whether to spend hard earned money and it is a real diservice to them to write multiple reviews under false pretenses. I hope in the3 future amazon will require a different sign on for each review."
1,I honestly wish the system would allow less than 1 star.,"This movie has one scene that is worth a look (and it lasts about 2 minutes), but the rest is trash. It is one of the most boring movies I have ever suffered through. In the beginning, you are not sure what's happening, but you're sure that it's slow and dull. About half way through, you finally understand what the movie is about and where it's going and you are extremely disappointed. Finally, you reach the end and if you are still awake, you are feeling extremely unfulfilled and robbed. I don't understand where all the hype comes from. It must be one of those movies that people don't dare to hate because somewhere along the line it became ""cool"" to like it. You will feel robbed even if you don't pay money to see it. I want my hour and a half back!"
5,I love to watch it over again,"Funny, touching, sweet, profound in a perfect way. Great soundtrack (I bought that, too), there isn't much of a plot, doesn't need one. Very simple story, very lovely. The scene at the hospital when Bill Murray is talking to an elderly Japanese man seems completely unrehearsed, natural and it worth watching the movie only for that. The two Japanese ladies sitting behind them keep laughing, it is just great. Bill Murray in the role of a slightly tired and jaded actor is beautiful. Just beautiful. By the way, I've never seen Bill Murray in anything that wasn't great. I've heard he's ""difficult"" to work with, but is that a bad thing? He does great work. This movie is a delight. Scarlett Johannsen is superb, the actor who plays her husband is a perfect young husband and the girl who plays the dumb action movie actress is a hoot. Beautifully shot, beautifully paced. Made me want to visit Tokyo. Each scene is fun to watch in itself, little vignettes (did I spell that right?)."
3,Lost In Translation,There were 6 minutes of previews at the beginning of this DVD which you are forced to watch because the DVD wont allow you to skip ahead to the main menu. Despite my mood being soured by the previews at the beginning of the DVD I enjoyed the movie.
3,Good try but watch a real Japanese movie for realism,"First of all, I don't hate this movie. It was pleasant - not exciting, riviting or moving, but pleasant. Bill Murray was exactly as he is in any of his dozens of slapstick movies, only a bit older and more sedate. I have a feeling the only reason he was nominated for the oscar was because he's been around so long and is probably very popular with the other ""stars"" who decide these things. He wasn't terrible, but one can only make that same lost-dog face work in so many movies. Scarlett Johannson was very good and you did feel for the loneliness of her character. The filming was crisp, the sound quality is good and there are a few chuckles here and there, but for the most part I think many people raved over this movie due to their inexperience with Japanese movies and were enchanted by the different culture. For a great Japanese movie, try ""Shall We Dance?"" or ""Tampopo""."
2,Bill's great but that's it,"After seeing this movie I couldn't figure out what the hype was about. Visually this movie is wonderful. Everything is bright and colorful and so unique that I was constantly gasping saying ""look at that!""Bill Murry Is a treat. It's great to see him in a new movie just being perfectly Bill.However the plot was so horribly boring I wanted to cry. I was fighting to stay awake just so I could keep watching Bill. If you go and see this movie just don't expect anything wonderful. Bill is the best part of the movie. Too bad 'cause I think it had a lot of potential."
2,"The idea is there, the film is not","This movie, despite all the hype, was at best mediocre. The idea is great, being lost in a foreign place and making an unlikely connection almost like an out of body experience where your ""realities"" are waiting for your return.The idea of the story was almost at complete odds with the movie. Acting was bad, and directing too. I was happy that the story was recognized by an Oscar, but not the movie!"
2,LOST IN MEDIOCRITY,"Probably the most overrated film of the year. A good word for this movie is DULL, because it goes nowhere fast. Bill Murray is a has-been actor from the states filming a commercial in Japan. While there and bored he meets Scarlett Johansson, who is also bored. They get together and are bored together. Its contagious and quickly spread to the audience. Not sure what the buzz is about. Murray's talent is clearly wasted here.Rent or buy something else."
5,Tone Poem,"Someone compared this movie's last scene to a lyric in a pop song, and not kindly, because it is elusive and allusive enough that the viewer/listener has to fill in the gaps. Do you know what they call spare writing where the reader has to fill in the gaps? They call it poetry. I wonder how many who dislike ""Lost in Translation"" actually like poetry of any kind.In just a few short lines a poem can move you as powerfully as any novel. The most small-scale work of art, perfectly honed can penetrate deeply. But you do have to make an effort yourself to fill in the spaces.""Lost in Translation"" is beautiful for the same reason a haiku by Bashu is beautiful. And has a similar mood.The year's first daythoughts and loneliness;the autumn dusk is here."
1,This is NOT BLU RAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The image quality of this movie is just TERRIBLE!!! Image looks washed out, grainy and color is bad, some scenes looked worst than VHS. I purchased Trading places with Eddie Murphy and for being a much older movie it had much better image quality. I have a 55 inch Samsung plasma 3D tv. What a rip off this movie is!!! I can not believe it is legal to sell such crappy product with a Blu Ray label on it. I am sending it back for a refund. It looks like I am watching VHS on a really expnsive tv. For those of you reviewing the movie itself, GET A CLUE!!! This is AMAZON NOT IMDB!! We should all help each other and describe the quality of the blu ray so others dont waste their time and money on garbage like this!!!"
4,This film is brilliant in subtle ways....,"A box office special effects hit it is not. Hollywood, however needs more human films like this. These stories about the interplay between different people, who may only meet for but a short time in their life, and may be world's apart age-wise, are important. Basically, Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who decides to take a commercial gig in Japan, pending his next role. Murray feels like a fish out of water down there, and ponders returning early until he meets an American girl, brilliantly played by Scarlett Johansen, who feels the same as him. Her recent husband, played by Giovanni Ribissi, tends to neglect her alot as he's working on his own career as a photographer. Inevitably Murray and Johansen become friends and explore Japan together. If you like independent films, and you can be patient, this film is worth the trip."
2,I have to agree it was boring,"I do not consider myself a movie watcher who needs action/adventures to be entertained. In fact, I had high hopes for this film, but it was very disappointing. The beginning is slow; the ending is meaningless, and, as for the rest, it was difficult to find a plot. If we were suppose to understand the lonliness of the characters or the difficult times during marriages, I think that it could have been presented in a much more engaging way.I think that most movies should be watched, just for the experience, but no one should buy this one."
1,Pathetic,This has to be one of the few movies where someone received a best director nomination even though you could see the boom mic in several scenes LOL!! Reminded me of a freshman student film where the director has not yet learned to line up the shot to avoid having the boom mic rereflect into the camera.
5,Me too.,"I have to agree with the last reviewer. I was surprised to see such a low rating for this movie. Sweet story, great scenes of Tokyo at night, uplifting ending -- I loved it. You will, too."
2,Boring...,"Boring. what else can I say? I used to travel alone alot but I can't connect myself to this film. Will I share a bed with a stranger? No. Not even my close friends under any normal circumstances (seriously). There are so many things to do, to see, and to film in Tokyo; and I don't understand why the director, Sophia Coppola, picked a hospital and made fun of the people there. Just plain boring. But I find the Karaoke scene interesting because this is really part of the Japanese culture and that storyline should be developed more. Afterall, it'd better to have more communications among the characters in the film."
1,You can't really call it a movie.,"There is no plot and there is no acting. Bill Murray didn't even have a script. I watch movies to be entertained, not bored. This is the second movie I could not even finish (the first one was Pi) because it was so boring. I don't know how to explain it any further, there is no plot! It's as simple as that. I would not recommend this to anybody who still enjoys movies with a plot."
1,Lost My $18.00....,"Lost the time it took to watch this plotless wonder.Lost the Oscar (thankfully.)Almost ""lost"" my mind.Please, choose another movie!"
3,Way overrated.,"Tokyo does most of the talking in this movie. The script is very bare. The pacing is sloooow, so don't watch it when you're tired, unless you're looking to fall asleep. I was disappointed that their relationship had to turn to romance. How original and unpredictable. Nineteen-year-old actress, fifty-something actor--inappropriate and grossly overdone in Hollywood."
3,"5 star movie, 3 star DVD","Lost in Translation is one of the best movies of 2003. It's truly a masterpiece. However, the DVD was done poorly. You cannot skip through the previews at the beginning of the disc and there are no commentaries. There's no excuse for not having at least one commentary track for a movie of this caliber.If you want to see this movie (and you should) then rent the DVD and wait for a director's release DVD with better quality extras. (or at least one that you can pop into the DVD player and watch without sitting through 15 minutes of advertising)"
2,A Bit of a Disappointment,"Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have surprising on-screen chemistry despite a massive age difference. I must disagree with someone's comment that acting ""real"" isn't acting. If it isn't realistic, then it is hammy, so what do you look for in acting? The story, however, is a little dull for my tastes. All though this film does an excellent job of creating the illusion of reality, I prefer the movies where something actually happens. This storyline has no hook, nothing to keep the audience in the seats. And, it doesn't help that the film portrays the Japanese as obnoxious, which couldn't be further from the truth. The viewer is left depressed, irritated, and a little bit drowsy."
2,Coppola couldn't figure out what to write...,"hence, the whisper, that frustratingly unintelligible whisper. I am dismayed that this poorly-written movie was not only nominated for a screenplay award, but it actually WON! It is just ludicrous.Murray did not deserve that nomination (yes, he was humorous, in that deadpan way of his; when Johanssen laughed, I laughed, but that is not enough to garner an Oscar nod ). But even more so, Coppola did NOT deserve those three Oscar noms, and to WIN for Best Screenplay is just plain WRONG.This is exactly a two-and-a-half star movie -- not great, not terrible, just exactly there in the middle. It is no wonder that many of these four and five star customer reviewers don't just review the movie, they also insult other customer reviewers. They obviously lack heart, just like the movie."
2,Tripe,"This movie tries desperately to express the struggle two people undergo to find meaning in their lives. Unfortunately, the expression of the whole concept of what it means to be human is overdone and tedious, and the main characters are unsuccessful in appearing complex and multi-dimensional in their journey. Instead, they seem spoiled, ungrateful, and just plain bored. All the scenes showing the main characters looking out of windows or looking into their drinks become annoying when you see them for the 99th time. I understand what this movie was trying to express, but it failed miserably and instead comes across as an immature and underdeveloped low-budget film that happens to have a big star in it and an association with another famous director. The Coppola reputation and Bill Murray's talented performance can't salvage it, unfortunately."
5,What a different film.,"A pleasant movie to watch. Lost in Translation is almost indescribable because the film is basically about nothing. Bill Murray plays the struggling actor character with much honesty, and Johansen plays the confused 20 something well too. Set in a vibrant setting, the outlandish Tokeo, this film centers around the two leads. They constantly bump into each other and grow a friendship. It is very sweet to watch the two together who have this weird chemistry on screen. The only complaint about this film, is that you sit through an hour and a half of PG rated humor and then suddenly, Bill Murray is sitting in a strip bar watching a Japanese stripper. I though the film could've done without the scene but that might be the only way Sofia Coppola could sell her film. All in all the film was wonderful and I would put it in among the years best films. See this movie for a relaxing film."
1,Big Letdown,"I think the popularity among critics is that it shows an 18 year old playing a 20-something who actually has an attraction to a geezer. Speaking for all geezers, it gives us hope. An otherwise bland and boring film."
4,Atmospherically perfect,"For any westerner who's ever spend an extended period of time in Tokyo, LiT perfectly recreates that feeling of ""apartness"" and disconnection from the local culture. It's not a diss on Tokyo or the Japanese, but just a cultural distance that's difficult to bridge, which Coppola recognizes and accurately captures - amazingly! This is a subtle, refined film with a thin story -- more of a poem - or haiku, maybe? :-) -- than a conventional plot-driven tale."
1,Aptly Titled,"From all the movie critic reviews, I thought I was getting either an artsy film or a comedy. I got nothing instead. This is the most pointless and boring film I've seen since ""About Schmidt"". I know where Coppola was going with the film, as I have been stuck alone in Tokyo and other foreign cities numerous times, but she just wasn't able to pull it off. The only thing she got right with this one was the quirkiness of modern Japanese pop culture. The plot was too loose, and the only funny scene was the one in the exercise room. This was an extremely disappointing film, particularly since it got so many rave reviews from critics."
2,Lost in boredom,"This movie was nominated for Best Picture. You'd think that would indicate that that would be an indication of a good movie. My friend and I thought that when we went to see it live. So we sat, waiting for the good part to come -- and then the movie ended."
1,Not my cup of saki..............,"Having lived in Japan for nearly 14 years, I was so hoping for a look at a country I love (like is seen in parts of ""Enlightenment Gauranteed""). Instead I found this to be a depressing, non-acted film where the Japanese were made to sound stupid because Bill Murray's character simply didn't want to take the time to learn and understand anything about this marvelous place and its citizens. Here he and Johannson's character had the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy Japan and all it has to offer and instead they were maudlin and condescending. This could have been a good film...it was not but that may be because I personally know what the characters missed. Regardless, I think the movie cast Japanese people from a less than positive vantage point which was offensive to me and I think will be to others."
1,"dull, boring","I liked a few scenes, Bill Murray is a great comedian. But overall, it was long, boring and almost completely without beauty"
1,How did this win awards? HOW,"I bought this crap based on the rave reviews and was stabbed in the back for doing so. Please if you do not believe this movie sucks RENT THIS FIRST, dont buy it."
3,lost in the funny movies Bill Murry is in,"This movie was bad because Bill was not funny. Differet websites said it was a drama, but I thought it was kind of funny; then I changed my mind. It was nominated? I thought it was pretty good, but I can not believe it was nominated. And Bill? God, it was heck that he got a chance. Well, I will put it this way: Bill starred as Bob Harris, and he goes to Tokyo. There could have been more, but they (Hollywood workers) decided to make it boring. And there will be better films in years to come and they (Hollywood workers) will realize that this film could have been better. So import some more countries and citys. So sit back and relax and enjoy Lost in Translation."
1,"""Winged Migration"" is a far better movie!!!","Please watch the film ""Winged Migration"" instead. That film has gorgeous photography of birds in flight and is truly life-affirming. It is NOT boring like this very bad movie about two depressed people getting together and doubling their depression. ""Winged Migration"" is 85 minutes long and will leave you in awe of the natural world.I only watched the first hour of this super-dull movie. Save your time and money. This movie is dull, pretentious, and incredibly bad. Let's hope the Academy gives its Oscars to other films and actors."
1,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in this film. I really like Bill Murray, but his female co-star said it best, just another male mid-life crisis. It attempted to depict the void that people feel when they attempt to find meaning apart from God and showed how flat we fall when we turn to drugs, sex and alcohol. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that they would show that the characters learned something. It was a false hope. Don't waste the time and the money."
1,Murray & Johansson in Slumberland,"This film was produced for those of you who may have trouble sleeping. I usually enjoy offbeat films, and liked some of Bill Murray's comedy features, but this movie has nothing to offer except a cool soundtrack and some neat shots of Tokyo. Numerous scenes of the Murray character in the hotel bar set the tone for this mostly monotonous film.If you can swallow the implausible premise that a young, hip chick in Tokyo would be attracted to the lunkish, sullen Murray, then you may enjoy this. I kept wondering when something interesting or humorous was going to happen - nadaIts a soundtrack with a half baked movie attached. The point? maybe that lonliness makes young girls pine for unattractive older men who hang out in hotel bars. This would be a good way to cleanse the palate if you've been watching too many Hollywood action films,otherwise stay away. One star for Scarlett Johansson though, - a pleasure to watch and a darn good young actress."
1,You People are NUTS!,"How is it possible this movie has received so many 4 star reviews? I'm a fairly easy to please movie goer and sat in utter amazement at how UN-riotously funny it was. Over 80, 4-star reviews??? I guess my version didn't come with the appropriate drugs."
2,Artistic BUT,To answer the question 'Will YOU like THIS movie?' It all boils down to the fact that this is a Bill Murray movie. If you like Murray you WILL like this movie because Murray is Murray regardless of the production he is in. But be forewarned--Cadyshack this is not. Keep in mind you are watching two very bored people try to cope with their situation. If you're looking for something funny Lost in La Mancha might be a better bet.
1,LOST IN TRANSLATION LOST IN MAKIN,"I fail to understand how this movie got so much euphoria around it. The movie is incredibly slow moving, no well filmed, and just plain out boring. ITs the type of movie to watch when you're really depressed and just feel moping about. OK, so the acting might be good, but i mean, whats a movie without a plot?Lost in Translation was terrible."
1,i guess i am too dumb for this,"I was looking forward to this film to be released on dvd and rented it about three weeks ago. Amazingly, it still remains in me memory of certain distaste. The music by Kevin Shields was nice and so was Tokyo. The rest of the film (story, characters and cal) tried desperately to appear deep and dimensional, but it just didn't work. Maybe it was because the film was from Hollywood and I thought the colours were just too rich in contrast to the slow, boring mood in the film. Somehow i got the impression that the Coppola wanted to achieve those moods and... a story about people being meaninglessly stupid and fearing their own loneliness (although they brought it upon themselves). If true, well done fooling us!Just dont bring any expectations when watching Lost In Translation, but rather have your own voice and emphaised with the characters when you wish to."
4,It doesn't go BANG! tsk tsk.,"Unfortunately, the only way audiences seem to be satisfied with a picture they view is if every line and every scene is delivered to them via a baseball bat to the skull. Humor and emotions have to be so brutally transparent so as one can assume zero brain wave activity and still fully enjoy the movie.To those who gave this movie less than 3 stars, I pity you. Life must be dreadfully boring.I thought the cinematography, dialogue and acting were superb. I think it is an accomplishment when a movie can set a certain mood and be able to work within its parameters not searching for cheap thrills.There is wonderful chemistry between the characters and the humor, although not delivered by Bozo the clown, is found throughout.In short, I loved it."
1,Lost in Translation is Just Lost,"To call this movie minimalist would be kind. There is about as much thought in story and character as a 30 second Coke commercial. If it wasn't for Bill Murray and his talent to improvise there would be no movie at all. The director has about as much vision as a UC film school freshman. Cut the constant establishing shots of the city and the movie would barely make sixty-minutes. She obviously doesn't have the slightest idea or interest either in fashioning an ending to her pedestrian plot. This film was obviously made the old fashion way; pure unadulterated neoptism. Rent ""School of Rock"" instead for a laugh a minute evening."
1,DONT' EVEN BOTHER !!!!,This was the most uneventful film I have ever seen. It is like a bad reality show about a man on an uneventful business trip. I cannot believe this movie got any attention at all. I think what was lost in translation was the point to the viewer. There was no point. If I had to tell you about the movie I would say it was about a man on a business trip who met a girl whos husband was on a business trip. They exchanged words now and again. He went home. The end.
1,Wait..... what????,"This has to have been one of the worst movies I have yet to suffer through. Zero plot. The attempt to portray two lost (pun intended) individuals searching for meaning in their lives falls far short, resulting instead in a tiresome and altogether disjointed film. Finally, the movie's portrayal of Tokyo life must have left travel agents fuming."
1,lost in filming,"I found this movie totally empty of plot, of interest, of good acting, and of good direction. I have no idea why it won an academy award since I found nothing in the movie that was a story or good acting or good direction. I recommend anyone who is interested to save their money."
3,Not for me,"The quality of this dvd is fine, I might be an ignorant but I am sorry I hated this movie."
5,A great movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, because of the fact that it is so different from most other movies out there right now. It feels like they took a ""day in the life"" approach, which contributes to the unstructured feel of the story. It feels like an honest portrayal of unrequited love, something that is very ordinary and not dramatic or schmaltzy. It was refreshing to see that loose ends were not tied up in a pretty bow at the end, much like life. Oddly enough, you would think that a movie without car chases, explosions, or horrifying revelations would be boring as hell. Not so - I didn't once look at the clock thinking, ""Are they done yet?"", as I have with numerous releases in the past couple of years.The DVD has a good amount of extras, considering the type of movie. The extra scenes were good, but would have screwed with the pacing of the final product. And the behind the scenes featurette was entertaining. All in all, a very worthwhile purchase."
5,"An extraordinarily beautiful, subtle, work","Fifty years from now or so, we will still be discussing ""Lost in Translation"". It is a movie that is not about 'nothing' but a film with the stillness of everyday life at its center. The performances are so finely nuanced that they no longer seem like ""Acting"" as the movie barely seems to be ""Directed""; the transparency that is achieved by this work of artistic creation will grow as the years pass by - as we strive, in contrast, fifty years from now, to remember the name of that year's oscar-winning director whose amalgam of sound and fury signify, ultimately, nothing. - I must add, four years later, that this film is best seen in the theater. It is marvelous on DVD as well; it's just that there is something gained by this work when the images we witness are truly 'larger than life'."
5,You either love it or you hate it,I believe the only people who are fortunate enough to 'get' this film are those who can identify with the characters.I'm very fortunate. It's the best film I have ever seen.
5,"Deep, poignant story. Very funny and also sad.","A beautiful romantic comedy but not in the normal sense. It's hilarious at times and sad at times. It's about two lonely people visiting Japan who develop a very special friendship and personally grow as people as a result of their friendship. Bill Murray should win an Academy Award for his amazing understated, brilliant acting performance. He's also very funny at times. The movie's plot does not play it safe, like many other movies. This pays off. This film is an incredible achievement for the director/writer. It's a deep, meaningful movie."
1,Made to be bored,"Since this movie wasted enough of my time, here a short summary:Not only the characters were bored in Japan!"
3,i'm a bit lost,This movie is okay but I'm a bit lost watching it. Bill Murray can't act. Good thing this Johanson girl was there to save this movie. Call me at 156-38-3461.
1,Typical Hollywood bigotry,"Most of y'all just don't get it (save only a few smart posters)... this movie is reeking with racism. For me, the racism was very blatant and not subtle in the least. For those that didn't pick up on it, I feel very sorry for you, you need to escape your white coccoon and face reality... just because you don't think something's offensive doesn't mean that it's not offensive. White's are not the only race who's opinions matter."
1,"If I could, I would rate it 0 stars.","No, really. You're not 'missing' anything. If anyone tells you that you 'just didn't get it', please punch them in the face, for me -- at least a dozen times.Worst. Movie. I've. Ever. Seen. In. My. Life.The rave reviews and press on this movie has me seriously considering suicide. Who wants to live in a world this phony?Sophia Coppola has officially been added to my 'Stupid Bit***s To Slap' list."
2,i likde this movie.,my brother saisd that this was a good movie so i went to see it and do you know what my brother was right!!!! i watched this movie three times and i still like it alot more than some other movies that i have seen before that i don't like as much if you like to watch movies about japan this is one of those movies. i learnt that japan is a place were lots of people to go have a nice time exccept the maine characters in this movie LOL ;). even tho you dont know my brother you should still take his advise and see this movie because it is a good movie.
1,A disappointed Bill Murray fan,"What did I miss in this movie that the critics thought so highly of it? This movie was like watching two people wandering across a desert dying of thirst! This movie proves that critics have as much credibility as weather forcasters. This movie stunk, rent the Care Bears instead!"
1,terrible,This has got to be Bill Murray's worst film ever and amazingly he may win an Oscar for it!! It is like Alex Rodriguez winning MVP in a year he spend on the disabled list.
1,Definitely lost on me,"Usually the more people who tell me I 'have' to see a movie or listen to a certain singer, the less likely I am to do it. I should have stuck with that plan! I finally saw this movie after hearing everyone call it a masterpiece and I hate how everyone is saying you are stupid if you don't 'get it'. I didn't like it (nor did my parents) and I don't consider myself (or them) stupid. Although I am stupid for listening to the reviewers. About halfway through (during one of the eighty scenes when they were singing karaoke) I picked up a book and started reading it while this movie droned on in the background. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is boring and asinine."
1,Aimless...boring....zzzzzzz,"I agree with another reviewer who pointed out that if the director had not been named Coppola, this movie would never have seen the light of day. This is, quite frankly, a movie in which nothing happens. When my wife and I saw it in a movie theater, we followed a stream of others out the exit about midway as the movie lumbered along. That the movie was nominated for Oscars says something about the ""avant garde,"" but I don't know exactly what that would be."
1,"Should have won for ""most over-rated""","As a big Bill Murray fan, and after reading all the good reviews, I lined up to see this movie the day it opened in my area. What an incredible disappointment. I can only attribute it to Sofia getting a free ride on her daddy's name (again). There should be an Oscar for ""most over-rated"". This would take the cake, maybe of all time."
1,BORING!!!,"This has got to be the most boring movie I have ever watched. I just kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. It was a waste of my time and all the plots lines they could have pursued, they didn't. It was a major disappointment since I like Bill Murray and the previews for this movie made it seem a lot different than it was. Of all the people I have talked to that have seen it, I don't know a single one that actually liked it. Not a good choice Bill."
2,A Week in Japan.,"I don't get it. Sorry. A quiet movie that I found relaxing to watch as there was not a lot of background music. But, I don't get all the hype. What was this movie about, other than 2 Americans who meet up in Japan and form a friendship? What's the big deal? I kept waiting for the ball to drop or for Bill Murray to bust out and be Bill Murray. Never happened. Scarlett is very pretty and easy to watch. Only need to see it one time, if that."
1,jeepgirl109,"Lost in Translation was a waste of talent, time and money. The plot (what plot?) is horrible. For intellectual stimulation this is not the movie to see."
1,Horrible,"This movie is the second worst movie I have ever tried to watch. One good line amidst an entirely forgetful, boring movie."
2,A great movie about nothing,"Like SEINFELD was advertised as a ""show about nothing"", this is ""a movie about nothing"". No matte how delicate and tender Sofia's direction was, the movie left me with no impression at al.. It dows no touch deeply Japanese culture; I've seen a lot of better movies dealing about middle-age crisis; the redeeming factor is really Bill Murray, who makes the best with hat is offered to him with the silly script.This movies seem to have achieved cult status. Alright, the girl was unhappy, Bob Harris was ""moderately"" unhappy,. thei love was impossible, the movie did not play it cheap, did not make them sleep together, and that was a merit. But I simply go bored wiht people singing karaoke in Japan for 90 minutes..."
2,okay but not that great!,My husband bought the DVD the minute it was on the store shelves because he said the reviews were good! We watched it and we both find it slow and dragging! The only reason I think he (Bill Murray) was nominated for the movie is because this is not his typical genre! Now I wish we just borrowed the DVD instead of spending $19.99 for it which I think will just be LOST IN STORAGE!
4,Strangers in a Strange Land,"I loved the way that the film contrasted the Westerners with Japanese culture. There was no connection. The Japanese weren't given english subtitles (to help us feel the confusion and overall alien-ness of the experience, too). The film made me feel like I was an insomniac (but it was supposed to). The protagonists could not relate to any of the non-Westerners but only to one another. I found that to be really super realistic and a refreshing respite from the no-matter-where-we're-from-we're-really-all-the-same bullpucky found in most other movies. A good movie!"
3,Virgin Suicides was better,"Interesting movie to a certain extent but gets old after the first hour and then it becomes extremely long and boring, i can only take so much japanese culture. Its loaded with exquisite images of the city , the life and the culture of the Japanese. About 2 strangers played by bill murray and scarlet johansan who find eachother in Japan while staying at a hotel. HO HUM. I was more interested in the japanese people than the characters bill and scarlet played. I recomend Virgin Suicides ( also directed by Sophia Coppola) over this. 3 Stars."
1,Don't be fooled by the Oscar nomination,"It's unbelievable that this movie had an Oscar nomination. It has no plot and wanders aimlessly. I kept watching because I was stunned that it could be so bad and was wondering how they would pull it together at the end. When it did mercifully end, they didn't pull it together."
1,ballot stuffing,"very interesting to see the ""fellow"" from seattle writing a dozen 5 star reviews. Aside from seriously lacking a life, it is probably similiar to the ballot stuffing that got this garbage an Oscar nomination. Scary how a few fanatics can manipulate the process."
1,Lost in Translation - that's for sure,"I am a big Bill Murray fan, but even that could not help me get through this movie. I kept waiting for the movie to ""start"" but it never did. And seeing that it is up for an Academy Award, I have to agree with those previous reviewers who say it's only because of Soffia Coppola's name. I thought this movie was boring, slow moving and it took 1 1/2 hours when it could have taken 30 minutes (if that) to get the point across."
1,Plotless and boring,"This is by far one of the most plotless and boring movies I've ever seen. I was simply unable to find a point. After all the hype surrounding this ""movie,"" I was, needless to say, very disappointed. The fact that Sophia won an Oscar for this waste of film is really quite pathetic."
2,I have a suggestion for those two characters with insomnia -,"THEY SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!Actually, it didn't put me to sleep - parts of the soundtrack were too noisy, and I was too hyped by my SHOCK that this mediocre movie has received such a plethora of critical praise.Like Johanssen's character, I did chuckle at most of what Murray said. But I was almost immediately struck by the patronizing attitude of the movie toward people of another culture, and I'm a middle-of-the-road type person, not an extreme PC type.There is nothing at all special about this movie."
2,Lost in the Movie...!,"This movie completely escapes me. I read all the reviews before seeing it, and was expecting to be pleasantly surprised.At the end, all I could see was a couple of lost souls wandering around tokyo, looking lost themselves. If the movie was ""intelligent"", I certainly missed it.Neither of the actors possessed any emotional latitude. They just wandered thru the movie lost themselves.After this movie ended, I caught the last 1/2 of the ""Last Samurai"". At least this movie did not pretend to be something else, and what you saw was what you got.Don't waste your time on ""lost in translation"" or you'll be lost yourself."
2,Mostly hype,"I expected great things of this movie but unfortunately, it did not live up to its hype. It was a one-note film, full of angst, and had no plot.I had read that there were some funny parts, but they must have been cut out of the version I had!And Bill Murray, nominated for a best-actor award...all he did was mope around with a long face and bassett-hound eyes!What a depressing, dull movie!"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","This movie is full of dead-ends and inconsistencies.If you like drama or comedy, do not watch this movie.It will put you to sleep. If you like dull moronicdialog with no substance, by all means, see it or buyit. Why the Bob character has fleeting relationships withwomen other than the one he is in love with is anyone'sguess. But, then again, by the end of the movie, you willbe asking yourself ""who cares?"". If you want to see amovie about Japanese culture, rent an international filmwith subtitles. The number of stars I pick for a moviereflects how many times I would like to see it. I couldn'tsit through this movie again. It is a 1 star.P.S. Watch the paper on the straw in the bar scene ;-)"
1,Too many idiots in this word,"This must be one of those films that people wasted their money watching and then wanting others to do the same. So they rated this boring movie high so others may want to see it and waste their money also. How sad. If people can really say they can identify with this movie, they must be really lonely and living a boring life. If wandering around a city looking out the window and looking bored is great acting, then this would be a great film."
1,a romatic comedy without romance and without comedy,"Its an art film made with the best of intentions: ""let's through out all the rules and make something totally different."" Well they did, and the result is a romatic comedy without romance and without comedy. And the worst part is the missed opportunity, for Johansson and Murray do have chemistry, but it is smothered by pretentious adolescent symbolism. This movie is tedious, irritating, banal, with sparks of brilliance that never last long and leave the viewer frustrated and worst: bored."
1,My date fell asleep,"And I wasn't far behind. Whatever appeal this movie had to others was completely lost on me. I kept waiting for something to happen, and waiting, and waiting."
2,For those who think they're smarter than everyone else,"I've noticed reading these reviews that people who love this movie tend to knock those that don't because they think we wanted ""explosions"", ""jokes about passing gas"" or other raunchy comedy scenes. Please don't be fooled. This is not an ""art"" movie. It's not that Lost in Translation is boring--it's that it has no soul. Coppola does nothing to make the audience care about the charachters, or care about the plot. Those of you criticizing people who didn't like it need to get off your high horses."
4,You either love it or don't get it...,"I watched this movie with a friend and afterwards, her reaction was 'Huh???' while I loved the movie. She did not get the point of the movie at all. If you are expecting a comedy, you will be disappointed. There are comic moments but this is definitely not a comedy. What it is is a lovely portrait of growing emotional intimacy between 2 lost souls - Americans totally out of their element in Tokyo who happen to run into each other in the hotel bar. Their friendship and intimacy is in sharp contrast to the characters marriages which are decidedly lacking in either friendship or intimacy. Bill Murray is excellent in his role of an aging actor, the script is great, I was entertained and touched by the movie. But if you prefer car chase scenes, explosions, and/or laugh-out-loud comedies, bypass this movie. You won't get it."
2,"Interesting idea, but racist","People visiting cultures unfamiliar to them as well as being adrift in their own lives in an interesting premise. That they find each other and connect may provide a satisfying movie.But I could just not get over the constant racism of the movie: it may be funny at some level for Bill Murray's character to be confused by a Japanese speaking director in Japan, but the movie seems to imply that these Japanese are just weird and insensitive. And Charlotte's youthful Japanese buddies are so stereotyped that they are insulting to all Japanese. Just consider the impact if instead of Japan, the characters were placed in Harlem and the film went out of it way to stereotype and insult the people who live there."
2,Dreary Days and Starry Nights,"This is a documentary about Japanese night life contrasted by some day-light tourist scenes. The photographic work should have been nominated for the award, not the screenplay. It show-cased a has-been and a might-be. Other than that, I wished I had by-passed the purchase of the DVD. E-bay to the rescue!"
1,Not deserving of its one Oscar,"The fact that this film won one Oscar at last Sunday's Academy Awards is an outrage. Pure nepotism was at work. Sofia Coppola did not look genuinely happy to be at the Academy Awards. She only got the Oscar because of her last name. In her acceptance speech, she thanked some people who helped her to continue writing the script for ""Lost in Translation"" after 12 pages. You can bet that the script is only a little bit longer than 12 pages.Sean Penn won an Oscar for ""Best Actor"". Thank God that Bill Murray didn't win. Penn deserved that Oscar. Murray didn't deserve the Oscar nomination."
1,Bored to Tears,I was really looking forward to this movie after all the great reviews in addition to the Academy Awards nominations.I was bored to tears.I shut it off after forty minutes.Totally overrated.The Japanese stereotypes are offensive.A waste of time.
1,Overrated!!!,"I just saw Lost in Translation on DVD. This movie defines the word ""overrated"". What a boring movie! I actually dosed off for a few minutes. I went back to see what I missed. It didn't matter. Boring characters, boring script, boring movie!!! I can't believe it was nominated for best picture while good films were passed over. I can't see how anyone can call this a great movie, unless understated and boring is now considered greatness. I write screenplays and one of the cardinal rules of screenwriting is ""don't bore your audience""."
2,"Dull, very dull","It is a general rule of ours that if nothing happens in the first thirty minutes of a movie, nothing is going to happen. Having read several reviews of this one, and having a long-time liking for Bill Murray, I forced myself to watch it through to the bitter end. It was no exception to the thirty minute rule.I can certainly relate to being stuck in a strange city with nothing to do, but the concept really runs dry pretty quickly. There are a couple of redeeming points about the film - it's interesting as a travelogue, the portraits of vapid people are fairly good - but all in all, it's just plain dull, dull, dull."
1,"Watch it once.... DON""T buy it........",I really think the only reason this movie went too far is because the director is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter.You can imagine this movie directed for some stranger and you will see nobody would say is a good movie. I really think is a terrible terrible movie and I never thought a movie so bad could even be consider as ANY Oscar winner.
4,Enjoyed it - not your typical Bill Murray movie,"I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't at all what I expected; it was different and unpredictable. If you don't like ""Kramer vs. Kramer""-style movies then you probably won't like this one. (Before you start flaming me...I'm not comparing this movie to ""Kramer""; I'm simply saying that this movie falls into the ""depicts real life"" bucket as opposed to the ""fairytale"" bucket.)Lost in Translation makes good use of cinematography; there are many nuances that can only be realized by watching the subtleties of the images in a scene. Personally, I enjoy a movie that requires a little thought and which requests that you at least halfway pay attention...rather than just spell everything out like I'm five years old.I really enjoyed the music in the movie too!"
2,nice travelogue,"Nice footage of modern Tokyo and Kyoto. And yes, it is hard to sleep when you first get to Japan from the U.S. because of the time difference, but overall, vacation footage,as far as I can tell. Bill Murray being Bill Murray. How hard is that? Good looking movie. A little naive regarding the Japanese people. Also, yes I would have liked to know what was said at the end, but that doesn't make it Academy Award material in my opinion."
3,HMMMMM disappointing,"Being a huge Bill Murray fan, and given the hoopla over this film at the Oscars, I decided to buy and view... Yuck. Depressing, over-stylized. Sure, still love Bill, but the subject matter lacked significant substance.."
2,Very Lost In Interpretation,"The title seemed to be the best in this movie, they showed Tokyo very nice but I did not want to watch any quide. The whole story very poor and disappointing and very far away from a comedy. Nothing could really make you laugh in the movie and nobody seemed happy. It would be ok if that was an award for a quide to Japan as a documetary."
2,Lost in itself,"Okay - the acting is excellent, the chemestry between the two leading actors is wonderful, the camerawork is supurb, and the message gets across beautifully.Given a plot, this could have raised a mediocre plot into a wonderful movie. With no plot at all, they merely frustrated me - this much work into telling a story should be spent on a story worth the effort.If you're prepared for mood without story, you'll like this flick. If you want some story with your mood, you'll be disappointed."
2,REALLY Lost in Translation,"The cinematography is excellent and, of course, Scarlett Johansson is wonderful to look at. Even Bill Murray is pretty believable as a washed up actor. But that's as much praise as I can muster. If this movie had a script at all, the dialogue couldn't have been anything more than a weak suggestion. It seemed as though Sophia Coppola just showed the actors her story board and told them to go improvise. For all the Oscar buzz it received, ""Lost in Translation"" is the 2003 version of a ""Blair Witch Project"" disappointment."
1,Lost in Meaning,"With all the praise that this movie garnered,I came away feeling as empty as the characters.I wondered why this movie did not explore more of the dynamics between Japanese/foreigner?The characters come together only out of lonely circumstances,and given any other place,would more than likely not be bothered knowing each other.Hanging out together in a different city does not make one a true friend,let alone soul mate.Sorry Sophia,this movie doesn't cut it."
2,Just OK,"It is a strange character study of two people lost in a strange land. In fact, it is two people sharing their own private desperation and depression. If you want to stay in a good mood, pass on this one. If you like to be ""Lost in Translation"" then have a nice time. For me, it was a waste of time and I was not the least bit impressed. There are much better films out there, and I can't understand all the hype."
3,Nothing out of the ordinary when traveling abroad.,"This movie is great for someone who hasn't visited Japan, but want to or plans to. It's labelled as a romnatic comedy, but the romance is not anything steamy. The comedy is smart, culturally eccentric, and sometimes just seems too dry. The movie is more like a well done excerpt on the film crew's journey in Japan rather than a movie which stands on its own. There was way too much karaoke in it- it was more of a filler to make the movie last longer. Scarlett Johansen gets great reviews for this- she poses great at the beginning. The Japanese imagery in the movie is impeccable- when they show the pond, it's breathtaking. Nothing too awe-inspiring otherwise- too critically raved for what it is. Not a must see, but an ""I don't mind seeing."""
1,Lost in Boredom,"I thought this movie was a great one, but instead I was almost falling sleep and my worst nightmares were better. There is absolutely no coherence and the dialogues are vague and infertile. I didn't like it and will not recommend it."
1,lost in the doldrums,"All I have to say is, if you want a movie to put you to sleep, this is definitely IT! This film is perfect for the insomniac looking for a way to sleep without the aid of sleeping pills! One of THE most boring movies in the past 10 years which somehow was able to receive quite a few academy award nominations. I don't recommend this movie. It's sad because I think Bill Murray is such a talented comedic actor. He has been so entertaining in most of his other films, just not this one. There is only 1 laughable scene, where he is in the midst of making a commercial. The dialogue between Bill and his Japanese director is priceless. However, that scene alone is not worth the time it takes to filter through this boring story line. Save your time and energy and see any number of his other movies instead. You'll be happy that you didn't waste your time sitting through lost in the doldrums."
1,"This movie ""lost"" me.","I watched this after the Oscars and I can see why Sofia won, however it's not my cup of tea. Call me shallow, but I just didn't get it. Great soundtrack though! Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'"
1,Einstien was right!,"In his examples of relativity, Einstien suggested that unpleasant experiences seem to last longer than pleasant ones, even when they are of the same actual duration.This movie proves his point. This trite, pointless attempt at entertainment felt like it went on forever.I've tried to figure out how Bill Murray could have gotten himself involved in a project like this. My conclusion: he lost a bet!"
1,See Kingpin instead.....,"If your really a fan of Bill Murray, avoid this snoozefest at all costs! I watched it based on the critics ""glowing"" reviews, and the fact that Bill Murray was nominated for an oscar. I should have known better, then to trust those artsie critic's tastes.If you want to see Bill Murray in a truly oscar-caliber role, then go see him as Ernie ""Big Ern"" McCracken in Kingpin. He just gets funnier and funnier the more you see it!"
1,amazingly bad,"The movie was just terrible and boring but reading the reviews on Amazon almost made it worthwhile! After watching this, I was so amazed at how this 'acclaimed' film could be such a bomb that I was dying to see some comments by others who didn't ""get it."" I really got a kick out of some of the hilarious reviews. Totally agree with whoever said that following almost any tourist around Tokyo for a few days with a camcorder would be as good as this. Also laughed at the guy who said he considered liking this film a character flaw! I rented this movie and ""Love Actually"" at the same time and they couldn't have been more opposite: Lost In Translation: dull, pointless, pretentious. Love Actually: entertaining, upbeat, well-written. Gotta say I love this website."
1,Not even a vodka tonic,"Could make this movie interesting. I tried. I wanted to like it. I went in with all the best intentions in the world, but wow. I can't imagine what would have redeemed it. Perhaps if someone had DONE something at one point or another..."
1,Big disappointment. Where's the story?,"To cut to the chase, why wasn't the script written so Bill Murray was single, and Scarlett Johansson's husband was cheating on her, and the two fell in love? This could have been a terrific love story. On a side note, (A) Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson had chemistry, (B) the directing was very good, and (C) Scarlett Johansson is very beautiful and a wonderful actress."
5,A modern-day classic,"I shouldn't be giving this film a 5-star rating, but as one more expat making a living in Southeast Asia, I couldn't help but laugh uproarously at so many things in this movie. It perfectly captured the essence of ridiculousness and culture shock that so many of us here encounter every day.It's redundant to say that Bill Murray is excellent; his bad performances are few and far between. And Scarlett Johansson performs well for a new-comer to the screen, but the real beauty in this film lies in its pacing. You're drawn into this ethereal neon culture which is so utterly different from N. American culture, but you can't help but maintain your fascination. Everybody who watches this will go home thinking:""What would it be like to live in an alien world?""On top of that, the film boasts an impressive soundtrack; one of the best I've heard in a long time, and perfectly suited to both the characters and the storyline."
1,Can I please have my 2 hours back???,"I can sum up the entire movie in one word ""disappointing."" I was so excited about seeing another Bill Murray movie, and rented the DVD the day it came out. I really can't think of a slower movie that seemed to lead me nowhere. And it took what seemed like an eternity to get there. As much as I want to like this movie, I must say ""STAY AWAY"". Don't do it to yourself. Just read the comments from the guy who posted ""Lonely Days, Lonely Nights"". That's all you need to know. You can thank me now."
1,"AWFUL, BORING movie; Go see Memoirs of a Geisha instead","This is an awful, boring movie. Sofia Coppola shames her family name with this piece of shoddy directing (aka garbage). This film is racist and plotless and UGLY as HELL. The acting of Murray and Johansson is zombie like. This is not acting; it's sleepwalking. Anyone can do it.For a film that respects Japanese people and culture and looks gorgeous to boot and has a real plot and MUCH BETTER acting, go see Memoirs of a Geisha."
1,Where is the 'Zero' star? One of the WORST movies of all time.,"Arguably Bill Murray's worst movie. And no doubt, one of Hollywood's worst. An ABSOLUTE dud. PLEASE, don't waste your money. If you really want to see it, borrow it from your brother in law. This movie seriously was 'Lost' in translation."
1,Please while you have a chance...stop !!!,I love Bill Murray.I hated this movie...i watched it almost all the way throughand gave it away.SAVE YOUR MONEY.
2,What was the point?,"I was surprised to see Bill Murray take this role, yes he did an awesome job acting, but what was the point. I just didn't find this moving appealing. I would ask NOT to see it again."
1,lost in deep slumber,"This is my first review on this site, i chose this movie because i heard it was a masterpeice. and i have to say wow, it sure is a peice of something. this is movie is like watching fungus grow. it is so boring. i like movies that spark interest and i am not dumb. i just found this pointless. Bill Murray was good playing Bill Murray. I was so happy he did not win the Oscar. I respect Bill Murray for Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, and Rushmore, but this movie did not do it for me. The whole time while watching this i was thinking about ""what would i get with my refund?"" The girl opposite of bill was very attractive. i am sorry i dont know her name but this is not one movie that people should become famous for"
2,SNORE,"This was a ""none"" movie for me. I could not relate to either of the characters, and as much as I like Bill Murry......no Oscar from me. The pathos of the two characters was a non relationship, only a bump, that did not ever register. Sorry"
1,"If ""The Sun Also Rises"" was made into a movie...","This film has a lot of similarities with Ernest Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"". The characters in both are heavily depressed and drink and drink and drink and drink. Both this film and Hemingway's book are about Americans in foreign countries. Both works are DULL, BORING, POINTLESS, and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME."
2,Poor man's Wong Kar Wai,"I found it difficult to identify with these rich, spoiled and oh so depressed characters. Movie relied too much on cheap gags at the expense of the Japanese. I found it hard to find redeeming qualities here. At least Wong Kar Wai's movies are beautiful to look at and have great soundtracks..."
1,A Piece Of Junk,"This utterly boring piece of junk was promoted out of fear, fear at what wrath Francis Coppola would exact if people in ""the industry"" didn't praise this piece of tendentious trash from the tops of mountains.This praise for this utterly lousy film reminds me of going to your boss's home and praising some finger-painting done by his daughter posted up on the refrigerator, with you knowing the whole time that your boss's daughter is a full-grown adult who does NOT live in a group home.Skip it."
2,"A film about, by, and for the snobs","Lost in Translation - a film about, by, and for the snobs. Two lifeless egotists, while suspended in sterile environment, happen to drift past each other and briefly develop an appearance of human relationship, then part ways and continue drifting aimlessly in that lukewarm formaldehyde of a movie. It was nearly as memorable and engaging as watching the movement of two floaters in a broken toilet. The fact that the toilet is very expensive and is located in a foreign country doesn't change the nature of what it is you're looking at.Bring this plot to a studio and unless your last name is Coppola you'll be lucky if you can pitch it to the security guard without being slapped silly. The photography was great, though. It had an expensive look and feel, perhaps like everything else in the author's uneventful life inside that ivory tower of hers."
2,uuuhhhh....Travel video?,"You can see the power that's supposed to exist, but it never actually gets there. There's too much focus on the surroundings to emaphasize the situations. The situations should've been the source. Bill murray rocks, but nothing else really does, at least not the way in which this movie's promoted. Too bad."
1,Overrated!,"This is quite possibly the most overrated pile of horse manure i have ever seen. People say i don't get the movie, well that is not true. I understand the point of the movie it is just so long and boring. After all the rave reviews I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did. If you decide to watch this movie do yourself a favor and shut it off after you see Scarlett Johanssen in her underwear in the first minutes, its all downhill from there."
1,BORING!!!!,"I saw this movie in the theatre. It was so boring that quite a few people in the theatre got up and left in the middle of the movie. I considered it a challenge to see if I could actually sit through the entire thing. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! This movie was about as exciting as watching carpet rot. The acting was excellent, but everything else about the movie dragged."
1,a nice helping of pre-chewed pabulum for middle-america...,"I don't get you people. Just because the movie is composed of arduously long shots with little dialogue- that don't make it compelling cinema. Just because the characters are 'alienated' don't make them interesting. Just because there's a happenin' soundtrack don't make it worthwhile. And just because Ms. Johansson looks nice in panties and can stub her toe believably- that don't make her talented. And just because the boom-mike falls into frame after frame, that don't make it arty, or relevant... And while I'm at it, Just because someone studied philosophy (which is a joke anyway) or dabbles in flower-arranging or is stuck in a dead-end marriage- that don't make her deep....There is no discernable script, or plot, or substance to this abortion. It's not that I hated it- there's nothing to hate. It's just a spoilt rich girl's painfully contrived delusions about herself and her place in the world."
5,Great movie,This movie arrived on time and in good condition. It is a wonderful work and special to anyone who has been lucky enough to have been to Japan.
4,A Wispy Daydream,"This is an interesting one. I think it is the type of film you either get a feel for or you don't. And that's okay. Certainly not as miraculous or profound as some think, it's a wispy daydream carried by a quiet, little story, an etheral soundtrack and an ending that leaves you with, ""what did he say?"" The performances are consistently great in this fish-out-of-water romance. Did it deserve all the attention? Perhaps. But maybe it's just that we need more of this type of film in our drama-, effects-heavy world."
1,Loved the Movie - HATED the DVD !!!! Shameless Advertising!,"First, let me say I loved the movie of Lost in Translation. Definitely a 5-star movie. BUT, I HATED the shameless advertising on the DVD. Much to my shock, after plunking down the money here to get the DVD, I put it in my machine and it automatically starts up with streams and streams of advertising for coming attractions,etc. Hitting the Menu or Jump buttons doesn't work! They've disabled it in this portion of the DVD! All you can do is do a forward scan... it still takes close to 10 minutes to get to the movie!!! Each time you play it! This is disgusting and shameless. No one wants to pay close to 20 bucks for a movie and have to sit through these mandatory commercials. I'll never buy a DVD from this producer again."
5,superior film,"simply the best film i have seen in years. if you don't like 'lost in translation', it is not because it is dull (it's because you are). i'm surprised that the ugly director's daughter could have made such a great movie, but here it is...and it's one of the best made in my lifetime. the only thing i can complain about is in the making of the film segment on the dvd, you get to see what a true tool ms. coppola is (she has everyone hold hands and all repeat some made-up word which she claims is a family tradition before starting working on a movie; what a dolt!).this is the best movie of 2003, no matter what the oscars say (since we all know that they are going to reward 'return of the king' (the worst of the three tolkien flicks) for the accomplishments of that trilogy as a whole)."
3,"I had expected something else,","And I was disappointed!This was a wierd movie! I felt lost in the subject of this movie, no conclusion, and no string of events!Since the movie maker is a lady and in hollywood there are only a few film makers who are women, I give her 3 stars otherwise it deserves a one!"
2,Bill Murray should get credit for a save!,"This movie was saved by a great performance by Bill Murray. Without his quirky and fascinating presence, this film would have nothing going for it.What a great dramatic actor Murray has become."
5,Wonderful,"For anyone who has felt out-of-place and lonely in a foreign country, this movie aptly encapsulates that feeling. Stellar performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson make the movie all the more charming. Subtle humor that will leave you giggling throughout."
1,Not that great,"How this movie won so many awards, I will never know. It has to be one of the most boring and rediculous movies I have seen in a LONG time. It is, actually, one of the VERY few movies that I have stopped because I couldn't take it anymore...another one being Blair Witch Project 2, if that tells you anything. I did, however, finish it after reading how the ending was so great. I don't know what is so great about the cut-off ending that was there. Horrible. The movie has NO plot. It is the same thing again and again. Bill Murray looking boring and depressed, walking around one of the greatest cities in the world...poor him. I rarely give movies bad ratings, even if they do suck, but this one was horrible. What compounds the idea is that it won so many awards...HOW?? Don't waste your time."
1,"I'm Lost, On Lost in Translation","Lost is the keyword for this movie: Lost money for buying the DVD, Lost time for watching it, and Lost on all the hype surrounding it. Much of the hype is that it was low-budget film (by current Hollywood stardards). After the first 20 minutes of the movie it showed. I love Bill Murray, and really wanted to like this movie, but the effort it would take to find one reason to like it would be more Lost time."
1,terrible times 2,simply writing this to add to the one star reviews and offset a lengthy 5 star review. the sky is very pretty tonight.
1,"""Lost In Translation"" SUCKS!!!","First, I would like to say that I'm a big fan of the french new wave and Stanley Kubrick. I think I can appreciate an ""art"" movie. However:1. Lost In Translation is a wannabe French film. It has nothing going for it. Of course it is very boring and pretentious, but that does not make it art.2. The acting is HORRIBLE, Sofia Coppola is the first director to get a boring and unfunny performance from Bill Murray, there is no chemistry at all between Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray.3. Dumb people like to feel smart too. That's why so many morons go around saying they like this film.This film is so shallow and empty, there's really nothing to say about it, other than IT'S REALLY BORING, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS HORRIBLE AND THE ACTING SUCKS.Nice try Sofia, I guess you've proven that talent is not genetic."
1,"""Lost"" is RIGHT!","I do NOT understand the fascination with the movie OR Bill Murray's performance. I didn't think the movie should even get a nod from the Academy. Bill Murray's performance was ""just Bill Murray"".Maybe there is something to this movie I didn't get? Yeah, so the two characters were ""lost"" people....And??? Jokes? Not in this movie!Doesn't deserve a rating in my book."
1,Don't waste your time!,This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Actually I shut it off after 1+ hours. I must say that I now feel dumber thanks to having to witness this dumb as rock movie.
1,To be kind: overrated,"To be truthful, boring and insufferable. The Academy was asleep when it nominated this flick for awards, and dead on its feet to grant one. There is nothing likeable about the characters and Bill Murray is totally wasted as a has-been actor making a commercial in Japan. Johannsen is cardboard as the largely ignored wife of a hot photographer. Murray is rich and famous, but unhappy: well, he cheats on his wife! Johannssen, unlike many REALLY unhappy and abused wives could easily leave but doesn't. Sorry, Hollywood, people with REAL lives and REAL problems aren't going to be entertained by rich people who have it all but sit around complaining about how shallow their lives are. Rent Bill Murray's classic ""Stripes"" instead and have some real fun."
1,"Face it, this movie STINKS","Anyone who gave this more than 3 stars has never seen a well thought out, intellectual film. There is nothing interesting or engaging about this film, except that Bill Murray does a good job acting. But he was much better in some of his other films. People who give this film 4 or 5 stars are the type of people who think Red Lobster is fine dining because all they ever eat is Filet O'Fish. I can only imagine what they'd do if they saw an Ingmar Bergman or Roman Polanski film."
1,And I thought American Beauty was a pointless movie...?,"Oh My. I have always been a Bill Murray fan. He's made many funny movies, many classics. Here I was expecting some comedy, maybe a little drama even. Two Words, Forget it. It is almost as if this movie were an actual attempt to deliberately avoid being entertaining. Its much like I would imagine sitting in a padded room for two hours. One thing this movie is chock full of, Melancholia. Perhaps that would have been a better title. I realize now the title ""Lost in Translation"" isn't referring to Bill Murray being in Japan at all, but rather the great divide between pretentious Hollywood elites and the average moviegoer...Do not even watch this movie to see why other people hate it, its so bad.. p.s. it doesn't really deserve a star but I must give it one to post this review."
1,Look at the cover,"I watched the movie and was dissappointed. Now I could write a lot of things, but I noticed that what describes the movie best is the cover itseld! Look at it and decide: Do you really want THIS?"
1,PLEASE MAKE IT END!!!,"There are no words to describe how HORRIBLE (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: ULTRA SLOW, SOOO BOOORING, NO PLOT (none!)... and the ""movie"" just ends! Can it get any worse??? Probably not! One wonders how did this film win ANY awards apart from ""worst movie of the year!"" Rent or buy at own risk. You have been warned!"
1,disappointing movie,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It never gets to where is seems is is going. Watch anything else...
1,100% pure Boredom,"Unimpressive: Nothing happens. No conflicts, no characters,no idea. The Ultimate Boredom Movie.Best to put me asleep on Sunday afternnoon.Did not make me think after.One look on the bored face and the nigtgown of the actoris enough to tell you enough.Waste of time."
1,Just Plain Lost,"I like bill murray, but this movie was aweful.Charlotte is a pretentious little snot and you can just see coppola living vicariously through her. This is basically a movie about a self-absorbed little girl who has the hots for an over-the-hill but presumably very rich actor. murray plays the sleasball well, the only thing worth watching in this movie.The plot, what there is of it, is weak -- Poor charlotte has to suffer lonliness in her 5-star hotel room for a week while her hobby go plays photographer. They're in the bar, their in their rooms, they're in a nightclub.blah.no story, no imagination, pretentious, insufferable, adolescent.basically, what you'd expect from a pampered little b--ch like sofia coppola."
4,"some will enjoy, others may dose off","I watched this with my fiance and a group of friends. While the film generated quite a few laughs, the general consensus was that it started off OK and dragged on at the end. I felt differently. I enjoyed the odd role played by Bill Murray and appreciated the performance of Scarlett Johannson. I suppose I also liked the film's international setting in Japan. The various scense from in and around Tokyo made for interesting viewing. I'm guessing that most people will rate this a 2 or 3, but for me it was a 3.5 or 4."
2,Beware of the hype,A near miss that has been sold with loads of hype. Bill Murray does some good work but it is really nothing that he has not done before. The depictions of some of the characters have a meanness to them that will put me off from watching it again let alone owning a copy of it. I feel that a second viewing would not be entertaining. R.E. and his peers must must have seen some other cut of this movie.
2,The Emperor's new ennui...,"To borrow an Americanism, I cannot help but be far out in the left field as far as this movie is concerned. I saw this movie in the theatre a while ago and frankly couldn't understand what the fuss was all about.Bill Murray gives another deadpan performance and Scarlett Johansson is impressive in her role as newly wedded (but ignored) bride. Yes, they are feeling rather alienated and are bored out of their minds (for whatever reason) in this city that seems to be teeming with life (and myriad forms of entertainment). Granted, some people will bored regardless of their surroundings, but does a movie about them have to be boring too?Or perhaps, it's an inside joke: a boring movie about boring people, who are themselves bored. In yours truly's opinion, just as the title aptly puts it, there's something ""Lost in Translation""..."
1,Better Than Ambien,"I still have not learned my lesson:if the film critics praise a movie I will probably hate it. I tried watching this movie twice; both times I fell asleep. I understand there are those who find this film beautifully realistic and a glimpse of people as they really are, but why watch a movie for that - just go sit on a bench at Wal-Mart and observe life as it walks by you. I found no point to this movie and it was simply BORING! I figured I had missed something the first time I had fallen asleep so I watched it again. Out like a light about 3/4 of the way through. This movie is the best sleep aid on the market!! Better than Ambien! You observe real life everyday - let Hollywood make exciting films. We want to be entertained."
1,Comedy it is not!!,"I thought this was a poor excuse for a movie, what a waste of Bill Murray's talents. I had a hardtime staying awake in this one. Basically, a snoozer!!"
1,Wish My Dad Was Frances Ford Coppola!,"Living over-seas in Southeast Asia, I was really looking forward to enjoying this movie. It was a tremdous disapointment. It is horribly slow, has little plot, and can these character's be more self absorbed? Japan is such an interesting place to visit even if you don't know the language. But these characters are so shallow they can't get past the differences in the language. If ""Charlotte"" is supose to be a philosophy grad, she sure wasted a lot of time in Japan not looking into the incredible amounts of philisophical sights and ideas that are right on the surface of this culture. It was about two really insecure people that had nothing to offer the audience at all. A great Graduate school project, but don't waste your money."
1,utterly lost,"In writing this,I have to admit to having not seen the DVD version of this film.But I have seen the cinema version just this afternoon.What a lot of overrated tripe.The film has no meaning,no goal,and seems to drift from scene to scene.The characters seemed to lack a sense of purpose,and the European style ""lingering shot"" just looked ridiculous,as if the script writer had run out of ideas.I found trying to identify with the characters hard going ,and ultimately couldn't care less.If I were Bill Murray,I would be embarrassed to have appeared in this film,and even more embarrassed to receive an oscar for this role,a role in which not much was required.And as for Scarlett Johansson,the only thing that can be said about her ,is that she looks good in her underwear,little else.Lost in Translation's right,utterly lost."
2,SLOW and DULL,"The movie is slow, almost to the point of no story at all. If you don't like intolerable cruelty then you won't like this one either. I don't know why people kept saying its good, I would rate it only two star. It is just a story of two people met in Japan and they were bored to death and trying to entertain each other till friendship is develop. And that was it. There is no point to the story. No action, no big drama, its just DULL. Just plain DULL."
4,what's the big deal?,"This movie was not as great as people make it out to be. I liked it enough to make it worthwhile, though. Maybe I missed something."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"My sister and I saw ""Lost in Translation"" this weekend, in a packed theatre. From the applause that followed, I'd guess that we weren't the only ones who were blown away. It was the first movie in a long time that really felt worth my time and energy, where I never wondered why I was there or had my attention wander. Its not a book, its not a rehash of something else, its not trilogy. Its just a very real piece of life, which is sometimes hard, and often exhausting. People make good choices, and bad choices & in between choices. And our paths cross, and it changes our lives a little bit. I thought both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen were well cast, and they didn't over play it a bit. The movie never took the easy way out. It just touched something in me. I hope you enjoy it."
1,Horrendously overrated doze-fest,"Perhaps more than any other, this is the movie I consider wholy underserving of its unanimous critical acclaim. I don't usually find it difficult to appreciate off-beat films on an artistic or intellectual level, but what this movie lacked in its ability to entertain (which is to say, none whatsoever), it failed to make up for in substance. I was unable to forge any sort of emotional connection with its two protagonists, and Sofia Coppola's script was sparse to the point of irritation. One of my most joyless and insipid movie watching experiences in recent memory."
5,A beautiful story,"I loved this movie. It was about a friendship developing, not a quick roll in the hay. Two people stuck in a culture not their own, find each other and discover they have much more to share than their ability to speak English. Tis is one of the few movies i feel is worth buying and watching again. It is a keeper."
5,Art,"Here's a question. Why can those who write negative reviews not use the word ""art"" without turning it into ""artsy-fartsy"".Surely a movie needs no apology for being art. Far from it. I am sick and disgusted with movies that make no attempt at art whatsoever and just aim at being bulk-fodder for the lowest common denominator.As far as I'm concerned, ""Lost in Translation"" is a great movie. Maybe it does show ""art"" in its making. If that's a good thing to you I'll doubt you'll be put off by it. For those who can see it holds many treasures. For those who can't, well ""you can lead a horse to water...."""
2,Title of the Movie right on the Money!,"Watching this movie you can't help but feel lost in the translation. The best part of the movie is Bill Murray's acting, the cultural faux paus, and the fabulous location. The worst part is that this movie has no point, a sorry excuse for an ending, and a big huh!What's the big deal! feeling. The critcs seem to love this movie but I don't think the viewers feel the same way. I can't imagine buying this movie and watching it again. But then again, I value my money and time!"
3,I didn't get it.,"I was pretty disappointed with this film. All the critics raved about this movie, gave it five stars, and touted Bill Murray for Oscar consideration. So I endured two hours on my couch, watching the DVD. I just didn't see what everyone was raving about. There really is no plot aside from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson wandering aimlessly around their hotel and Tokyo together. Murray is basically playing the same character he has been doing since ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Rushmore"", etc, except he isn't really very funny this time. I thought Bill Murray was great in ""Rushmore"". Although there are a few funny moments, the overall movie wasn't that funny. I kept waiting for something to really funny to happen but nothing ever did. I was also a bit embarassed about the caricaturish portrayal of Japanese people. This movie wasn't for me, but apparently some people really loved it. Go figure."
3,"Not as good as it;s ""supposed"" to be","I read all the accolades for this movie, then I watchged it. I don't know why all the reviews say it's funny, because I didn't laugh once during the film, and wouldn't call it a comedy at all. Well, I DID find the lyrics to the song that was sung in the strip club (NOT a prostitute scebe, hich was stated in another review) were just plain silly, along with a goofy melody.On a side note, the strippers were old and ugly, and not representative of the true beauty of japanese women.As much as I loved Murray in ""Ground Hog Day,"" I just am not excited by this film. Rent it first before deciding to buy.The DVD extra behind the scenes is nice, though and really shows how hard the cast/crew worked, along with some candid moments of Bill being Bill. I will agree with what one Japanese crew member said: Ms. Johansson and Ms. Coppola are ""cool"" and ""yasashii."""
5,Being far from Home,"I have been reading the reviews with great amusement. I agree that you either like the movie or don't with little range in between. Holding either opinion does not define you as superior to the other side. As for the comments on Tokyo and Japanese, I think this movie could have taken place in New York or LA or London. It is about being far from home, and not being connected with where you are. I have traveled many times on a direct flight from the Orient to New York or Washington DC. There is always a disconnection beyond jet lag. At home I wear a shirt and pants to work. In New York its a suit. The daily concerns of New York are just not like those at home. Tokyo is just different then the US. Not better or worst, just different."
4,DON'T BUY FULL SCREEN,"This movie is beautiful, but the full-screen version is an abomination. Buy the letterbox version and see Tokyo."
1,"Slow, boring, don't know what the hype was about.","This movie was stupid plan and simple. This movie started off slow and ended slower. Its a about a guy who has a small amount of fame from movies in the 60's who goes to Japan to do photo shots about liqure. He meets a woman who is married to a guy who seems loving and faithful, and turns around and cheats on him with a guy who is old and bitter and who is also married. I recommend that you rent or buy a DVD that is better then this. You have been warned, it sucks."
1,Since there's nothing lower than only one star...,"In my first review I fogot to say that the first thing you see in this movie is the buttocks of Johanson in her panties. What for?When a movie starts like that, can you expect anything good?"
1,A Zombie in Tokyo,"What a yawn! The plot? The sexual tension? What is all the hoopla about? This is a bad movie: it drones on and on. We serioulsy considered leaving after the first hour, but we kept saying it has to get better. We should of left. And if Bill Murray wins an Oscar, it should be for the part he didn't have in ""Night of the Living Dead."" He plays a perfect zombie."
1,Overrated,"I so wanted to like this movie but no matter how much I tried I just couldn't.It was just plain boring and I saw no emotional connection at all between the main characters.What with all the hype this movie received I surely expected much more than was delivered.I just don't get it and I usually love the off beat,different and unusual indy type film but was utterly disappointed with this movie.I wonder if the name Coppola has anything to do with all the praise this film is getting-of course it does-no other explanation!"
1,'lost' is certainly the keyword,"This is a sad, boring movie about sad, boring people. The front of the DVD case says ""Getting Lost Never Felt So Good"" but I ask what was good - Charlotte drinks a lot and feels sory for herself and is clueless about herself, her husband (oh my - he tried some different hair products and ""I don't know who he is anymore"")and life in general. So she picks up bored with life Bob in the bar and they hang out in Tokyo, but mostly drink, and this is supposed to be ""close firendship""? She pays no attention to her husband and is jealous of his friends."
5,An island of humanity in a sea of loneliness,"The setting: Tokyo - huge, unfeeling, plastic - a metaphor for the world we live in. The male protagonist: urbane, funny and accomplished, but at a lonely stage in his life, where he feels impotent and unimportant. The female protagonist: bright but just starting her adult live, in a marriage which cannot work. Insomniacs, they meet, and give each other a feeling of importance in a world where no one cares. The depth of feeling as portayed in the script and by the actors is stunning. I immersed myself in this movie in wonder. This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen."
2,A 30 minute short dragged out to nearly 2 hours,"I enjoy the offbeat, interesting and non-mainstream but sorry...this movie is just a bore from beginning to end. There's one central ""joke"" which wears thin after 5 minutes (Bill and Scarlett are the recipients of a constant barrage of Japanese which, of course, they don't understand and so simply mimic back as best they can in an effort to communicate...such scenes go on forever and made me yell ""All right...I GOT IT!"") There's about 10 minutes of plot (will Bill and Scarlett make a love connection?) , 40 minutes of Bill looking bored and/or confused, and an hour of pulsating Japanese night life. Which is fine if you're looking for a travelogue.Someone else here referenced ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" which were our exact words as we turned off the DVD player without bothering to check the extra features. Our eyes were already too glazed over. This was at best a 30 minute short dragged out into nearly 2 hours."
1,What a bore,"My wife and I saw this movie hoping that it would live up to its hype.However this was so boring we left before it finished .We usually like different movies,but neither of us liked this.We went to see the movie hoping for a comedy [ we both loved Love Actually ,Calendar Girls ,and Something's Gotta Give]but left wondering what the "" Film Guru's "" watched when giving out Oscars....maybe Sophia has some pull ?"
1,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever,"The praise and attention this movie was recieving in theaters and the Oscars drove me to check this movie out. I have never been more disgusted at a movie. The movie was so incredibly boring that I found myself drowsing during most of the film. Although labled as a comedy, I did not even get a slight smile out of the film. The acting was shameful, esecially for such icons as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen and the storyline itself was so basic and boring the whole point of the movie could have been conveyed in five minutes rather than dragging it out into a whole movie. This movie was a waste of time...don't bother wasting your time or money to see it."
1,I FELT MY BODY DYING!!!,"When the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie, I fled the theatre, arms spread wide, eyes ablaze, looking for something, anything, to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes. I wanted to bathe in bleach, or perhaps gouge my eyes out just to feel clean again.40 minutes into Lost in Translation (which, by the way, is a new code word amongst friends, meaning GET ME OUT OF HERE!), I could actually FEEL my body DYING! I would have collapsed on the theatre floor if the movie had gone on much longer. No, seriously,Most scenes went on for minutes (MINUTES!) too long, and were boring in both their content and meaning when it came to the paper thin storyline and simplistic character development. I want both my money & my 100 minutes back!Unfortunately, I'm forced to give this movie at least one star. There's not an option for zero."
1,It must be a joke,"This movie was awful. No story line, blatant metaphors about being alone even though surrounded by people. This could have been an important movie about finding friends when you least expect it or how people become so easily lost within and unhappy with their lives......I like independent ""artsy"" films BUT obviously the only reason this one got so much industry attention was because WHO the writer and director is. We can all hope she actually develops some talent instead of riding on her family name."
3,"Bittersweet, quaint tale","Monday, August 30, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Bittersweet, quaint tale.Exploring deeper human themes like isolation, loneliness, and boredom this was an interesting movie, almost quaint and child-like in its telling. World weary and tired washed up actor Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo and crosses paths with a disenchanted fledgling wife. Together they buoy each other as they slowly become inseparable friends exploring the wonders or Tokyo beyond the glass confines of their hotel. In a stand against cinematic convention, the two do not become lovers, if only to prove that an odd pairing like this can happen on a Platonic level. Thankfully, we are also allowed a brief glimpse into the other natural wonders of Japan through the landscape and religious shrines as the twosome does their own exploring. In the end, the viewer is glad that these two met and interacted, especially watching Murray grin genuinely at their final parting."
2,LOST IN WHY THIS IS A OSCAR WINNER.,"i give 2 stars, each for the actors. As for the restthe film goes everywhere and yet nowhere and when itit over the first thought in my mind is.....""let'sgo see a movie, its been such a long time"". Boring,with some interesting moments this is the mosthyped film of the year. I thought a second viewingwould change my mind. There is NO way i could sitthrough this again, I realized after the first10 minutes..............all over again!"
1,Boring,"I didn't care for this movie at all. Boring and without much of anything to keep my interest. The only thing I liked about it were the Tokyo scenes. Otherwise, I wish I'd saved my money."
1,RACIST!!!!!!!!,"WHAT A HORRIBLE RACIST MOVIE....Only Japanese women you saw in the movie were either prostitute or silly interpreter who can't speak English. Besides the story and everything, this movie has a fundamental fault! DON'T WATCH IT AND MAKE FUN OF JAPANESE CULTURE."
2,I got Lost As Well,I really found this movie to be pretty bad!! I mean I watched this movie and felt no empathy for the characters. Bob was some rich lonely loser and the female role was nothing but a crybaby who was jealous of her husbands fame. I think she should have stayed home while he was in Japan if she was going to whine so much. I have truly seen the bottom of the barrel on this movie. The only saving grace this movie had was the beautiful scenery and a few really cool scenes into the true Japan.
2,"Umm, boring","Ok, let's not overanalyze this rather two-dimensional plot. Characters, their interaction, their personal problems, yeah, well conceived, but... boring.This is a classic- a classic rental that is, or buy one of them used for $8..."
2,You'll Need a Double Expresso to Get Through This Yawner,"As a frequent traveler who has sometimes felt the displacement of another culture, I was looking forward to Lost in Translation. But twenty minutes into it, I was looking at my watch. If it weren't for the dialogue I would have sworn there was a technical problem and it was being shown in slow motion. Yes there were a couple of laughs, yes it was well acted, yes the cinematography was good but in the end nothing could overcome the weight of its incredibly slow pace. Perhaps I missed a deeper significance, but this movie was just plain boring."
1,Could Hollywood be any more stereotypical???,"Of course, most of the posters didn't pick up on this after they watched this cinematic atrocity... hmmmm... I wonder if it's cuz most of you are white Americans. Did anyone realize how they painted the Japanese in a non-human way? And every stereotype imaginable was used to portray the Japanese. I'm very embarrassed because this movie has received all these awards; what it should win is The Most Racist Film of 2003/2004 Award. I wish I didn't have to give this movie 1 Star.... I wish it could be in the negative range."
2,Pretentious and slow,"While sitting through this movie and the bonus features on the DVD I couldn't help but feel that those making it were constatnly thinking, ""We are SO cool because we can travel the globe and make movies overseas.""The movie did have some beautiful shots of Tokyo but that was really about it. The story itself was very understated and simple and really never took off in my opinion. The story can be summed up by saying that two Americans unhappy with their relationships meet each other and then wander around Tokyo. Their wandering around takes them to karaoke bars, strip joints and sushi bars. That's it. Nothing beyond that really happens."
2,Extremely disappointed,"Being a huge Bill Murray fan, I went into this movie wanting to love it. In fact, I purchased the movie before we even watched it! I went into it with no expectations except that it was going to be wonderful in an unconventional way. But try as I might, I couldn't like it. I found myself zoning out. My fiance and I discussed it at length, trying to understand why we didn't like it or why we didn't ""get it"". Then it hit me - it shouldn't be this hard. Just because some people consider it a great work doesn't mean everyone will. Murray has a few funny lines as you would expect, but the dialogue is extremely limited. A close friend of mine loved the movie because ""she knows what it feels like to be lost"" - she connected with Scarlett Johansson's character. I'm not sure if that means anything. Very rarely do I watch a movie, especially one so critically acclaimed, and feel as though I've wasted my time."
2,Good acting --Sloooow slooow story,"Acting was good its is just the story never really got going. There is no plot in this movie, it is just more a 'life situation' or 'point in time'. And outside a few moments, its just not that funny.Don't see this movie unless you liked Bill Murry in 'The Razor's Edge'."
3,"3.5 Stars, pretty good","I give the movie 3.5 stars out of 5. Overall it was pretty good. I'm not sure it deserved all the Oscar hype though. There is no glitz, glamour, or glory in this film, its just about two people (oddly at very different points in their lives) who connect while in a foreign country. Bill Murray is pretty funny. I guess you'd have to like him to like this film, which I did. The movie made Japan seem very interesting and mysterious, it made me want to go there."
1,Who would nominate this movie???,"You will keep watching and watching and waiting and waiting...then nothing happens!!!! This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I just kept waiting for something to happen...anything, but nothing ever did. What a waste of my time. Don't bother renting or buying this movie, you would have a more enjoyable time watching a blank screen."
1,Lame at best!!!!,"It kind of puzzles me how the film ""critics"" today rate films, and accordingly recommend films for honors, such as ""best Screenplay"", ""best motion picture"", etc. In my opinion, this movie is, at best, a waste of time - to say nothing of giving it those types of ""honors"". I can't believe anyone would be so fooled by a movie that is slow, lame, and pointless!!! Watch an old re-run of something on T.V., you'll be far better off!"
1,lost in the mundane,Save yourself the cash!This is a massive disappointment.I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time before it was released - I should mention it didn't REALLY get released theatrically in Australia...and obviously for good reason.This is ART at it's most obscure.Avoid it at all costs.
1,Gosh I liked Bill Murray so much more when he didnt know he was profound,"Wes Anderson and Sofia Coppola and Jarmusch all did him no favors. They are three of the most insincere, style over substance filmmakers around. And they all love clothes. And they all took a great baseball fan and turned him into an Oscar baiting self-serious ego wannabe genius walrus."
1,One word sums up this movie: Garbage,"This is a pathetic movie with pathetic characters for pathetic moviegoers. If you enjoyed this movie, you must have a sorry life."
1,"Ms Coppola, I'd like my money back please!","Don't waste your time. I never walk out of the movies, ever... I was very tempted with this one, but I stuck it through til the end. Biggest waste of time ever.There is no chemistry, there is no spark. I thought the movie was very self-indulgent and the relationship between the two main characters wasn't developed enough. I didn't feel their connection, and this ""connection"" of their's is what the whole movie blathers on about.I honestly have no idea what all the rave reviews are about. We must not have seen the same movie at all.There are so many other great movies out right now... 21 Grams, Cold Mountain, Goodbye Lenin, Mystic River... Save your money or spend it more wisely on a better movie."
2,"Eh, so so","I don't know maybe my expectations were a bit too high. I expected something to happen in this movie. It never quite gets off the ground.Let's put Bill Murray in strange situations and see what happens should be the title. I always liked Bill Murray, but it seems he doesn't have enough to work with. I'm not sure what all the buzz is about this flick.The woman playing opposite Bill is quite a boring actress,it must be nice to have enough money to sit around in hotel rooms and stare out the window, boring.She truly is a piece of cardboard. My friend saw this movie and didn't like it either, he said it never quite came together.The only thing that happens is you lose your money."
3,"Like the review says, atmospheric, not plot-driven","Let's just say I expected a lot more out of this movie. As they form a bond, Charlotte and Harris certainly are touching, most definitely because--not in spite of--they do not get involved romantically. That is what makes it so disappointing; there isn't much cause to get teary-eyed at the conclusion, because over the course of the film, you keep wondering when something like a story will start, and when it doesn't, you have little emotional investment in its nebulous finish. The film is mainly a montage of Japanese sights, which rocks if you're a fan of Japanese nightlife, but it just isn't enough to make a movie out of. If Coppola had wanted to make a ""valentine to Tokyo,"" she should have stuck to a documentary, in which nobody would have expected a plot."
3,Ticked Off,"This is a comedy alright, but the jokes on us. I enjoyed the journey of these two lost souls finding company and comfort with each other as ""strangers in a strange land"". I would have been OK with the ending being Bill Murray's character just riding to the airport thinking about what just happened. But this whispering in the ear and excluding the audience after letting us in on every little detail up to that point--- well it just ticked me off. Oh, I can sit there and come up with my own ending, but I wanted to know how, in Sophia's vision, this story ends. Maybe she doesn't know herself! I felt like I had just been had and I don't care for that. Had I known the ending before the seeing the movie, I'd have passed on the journey.I did get a few chuckles out of it and loved the ""Lip my stockings"" scene. But found the premise as rude as listening to a friend tell a joke to a group of people, only to have him turn and walk away before the punchline. You just wonder, why they bothered."
4,I enjoyed and am not sure why,"In describing Lost in Translation, I can say that Bill Murray is a funny actor regardless of the setting. I don't think many if any actors could have pulled off this role as well as he does.The movie presents glimpses of two people's lives as they befriend each other during their ennui in Japan. The development of the relationship between Bill Murray's character Bob Harris and the character played by Scareltt Johansson is enjoyable and is really lovely.I enjoyed the scenes of the Tokyo nightlife. The movie just seems to fade away in ending. There is no defined plot or climax and the audience must decide how it ended, what the lessons are, and what the point is.The movie is relaxing to watch, not too stimulating or exciting but enjoyable.The bar for it was set high by the many praises in the media so it did not meet those expectations for me but I was not disappointed. I liked the characters and that made the movie."
2,The emperor's new film,"There's less than meets the eye in this tediously overpraised example of good old fashioned Hollywood nepotism. Even more egregious than the baseless fawning was the film's trailer, which misrepresented this yawner as a comedy by showing EVERY funny scene in the film. Two stars for the exterior shots of Tokyo (although if you've been there, you know that even there, the film underplays the mindblowing reality)."
2,A dull yarn,"This movie is watchable as a travelogue as it captures Tokyo's urban landscape, but as an exploration of empty despair, loneliness, culture shock, blah blah blah, I found it neither insightful nor amusing. It feels as though Sofia Coppola came to Asia for the first time, had a sophomoric affectation by how different things are from America and proceeded to make this silly movie where the audience is supposed to ponder such things as - the novelty of jet lag - how the Japanese have trouble pronouncing r's (this is really exaggerated in the movie) and many Japanese do not even speak English...TV is different too. Culture shock and introspection ensues. Yes, how profound. This movie is no better than shows like The Amazing Race, where the rest of the world is just an exotic backdrop for Americans to run through and observe such differences."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees and see 50+ independent films a year. We drove for an hour in horrendous traffic to see this movie, and it is the only film we have ever walked out of in 25 years of adult movie viewing. It is pointless and banal to the point of idiocy. If you are a film buff, it is like the worst excesses of 60s French New Wave. Long shots of actors staring. Little or no dialogue. Brief scenes cut in that have no relationship to the (absent) plot. Long, long scenes where not a word can be understood. Characters you can't care about because they HAVE no character. Characters who are supposedly intelligent who can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the great cities of the world. We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Ugh. Don't waste your time. The positive critical response to this film can only be some bizarre plot to hoodwink middle America."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes. Awful. Just Awful.,"I have talked to people who liked this movie. They fawn over its goodness. I just do not get it. I think they're making it up. The only thing ""good"" about the movie is that it makes you empathize with the boredom of the main characters. The movie is so painfully boring that I kept waiting for the end that just would not seem to come. Skip it."
1,I have lost my faith in Murray,"First off i am a big fan of Bill , But this 'movie' is just plain awful. I have never disliked a movie enough to give a 1 star review but this one pushed me to it. There is no plot i could make a better movie than this just give me a camera in a foriegn city and film people being 'real' as many people have said this actors do so well if i want to see people being 'real' and bored I will take a walk down the street theres probabably a lot of people sitting on thier front porch being bored . So im sorry if im bored with a movie about people being bored."
1,Lost in Translation is definately a lost cause!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I heard a lot of good things about the movie and was very anxious to see it. I rented this movie with high expectations and was sorely disappointed. There was no point to the story as far as I could see. The reviews said this movie was hilarious; I sat through this movie for an hour and didn't find anything funny. It just jumps from one scene to the next with no purpose, this makes for a very boring movie. Although that is not to say that no one will like this movie, as the saying goes ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"". However, I would not recommend this movie at all."
1,worst movie ever,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I kept expecting something to happen in the movie and it never did. There are a couple funny spots but they are few and far between. A most of the movie consists of shots of Japan with no dialog. Keep your money and see or buy something else!
2,Waste of time,"If you have time to kill this is the movie for you. Don't buy this movie thinking you are getting a comedy. I was greatly disappointed in this movie. I expected to atleast laugh once in a while or atleast get some snickers with Bill in the movie. I think there was maybe three(3) places in the entire movie I snickered at all. I kept watching it expecting it to get better, but it didn't to my disappointment."
2,Flat out not Hilarious,"I bought this DVD because I was told by a friend it was ""Funny,"" and with Bill Murray, I did not question it any further. My mistake. The representations of Japan are very interesting, but the movie has little plot and you will have to search very hard to find much humor (at least not Bill Murray style). Later, my friend informed me that she had not seen the movie, but had heard it was funny. I Have seen it, all of it. I found it slow and uneventful."
1,Painful Experience,I have seen a lot of movies. This one is BORING....long and drawn out without a convincing conclusion...I rented this travisty at my local video store and feel I paid too much.Best part was it put me to sleep. Read a book and search for something more entertaining.
2,A generous rating out of respect to the Coppola name,"This movie was visually interesting but, otherwise, a completely unengaging stinker. I saw Sophia on the Charlie Rose program and liked her very much. It gives me no pleasure to be so blunt about this film. I am amazed at the critical enthusiasm and pre-Oscar hoopla. If there is ANYthing here, it entirely escaped me. (If you're reading this, Sophia, please don't be depressed. You're charming. It is more worthy to be an engaging human being than to make a good film. Besides, you'll probably do much better next time.)"
4,We thought it was a pretty good movie ...,"We just returned to the States after living in Seoul and Taegu in South Korea for four years.We thought the movie was pretty good, especially the parts about miscommunication. My wife undertands Japanese and I think that made the movie even funnier for her. The part where they are in the hospital and Morris is talking to the old man/woman was very funny, especially the reactions of the two women in the background.For those that have lived overseas, especially Asia, they will ""get"" this movie.There was a previous comment where someone's opinion was the movie was racist. Far from it; it is just a slice of life and it pretty accurate at that."
1,102 minute of my life I'll NEVER get back! Don't waste your time.,"I had very high hopes & expecations when I rented this movie. As a huge fan of Bill Murray's I ran out to rent it. I knew Bill Murray was nominated for the BEST ACTOR Academy Award. WOW, was I completely dissapointed with this movie. Long, boring, the plot is dumb, Scarlett Johannsen is nothing special, and unfortunately neither is Bill Murray, and the ending sucks. This was one of those movies where when the credits roll you look around and think ""did I actually just waste 102 minutes of my life on this?"" It is definitely in my ""steaming pile of crap"" movie category. The ONLY reason why anyone even heard anything about this movie is because SOPHIA COPPOLA directed it and actually WON BEST DIRECTOR for it. Obviously there were some major politics involved in that award."
1,"How can ""Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz"" get lost in translation?!","Man, what a boring film! Different, but boring. Different because it is an American film pretending to be a European one. How it got rave reviews is beyond me. Is it because Sofia Copolla made it? If she made a 3-hour feature with nothing but asses crapping from beginning to end, the critics would go ""ooooh, aaaah!""The Japanese were shown in very bad light - merely as a bunch of buffoons and intruders.On the merit side, both lead characters looked convincingly bored throughout the film (they were probably stunned into looking that way from reading the script). That should explain all the awards.I normally prefer to complete watching a movie once I've started. I agonized through this one.I agree with one of the reviewers. Sofia ought to return her awards.You think this critique (or whatever) is juvenile? Wait till you watch the film!"
1,Hate isn't strong enough a word,"...after buying and watching this movie my first thought was how much I'd like to skip it across the freeway.The opening scene IS the entire movie.- You have two loathesome, lifeless, and self-centered people wandering around one of the most exciting places on the planet and seeming to be able to do nothing more than drink and wallow in introspective malaise.Terrible photography, the ""emulating-a-slightly-drunk-person-with-a-handycam-perspective"" really gets annoying after a while. I can't say enough bad things about this movie...if you're thinking about watching this, smash yourself in the face with a ballpeen hammer instead, it will be more enjoyable."
1,"who did Sophia ""date"" to get these awards?","to get to this forum i had to choose a rating for the dvd. I gave it a 1. In truth, there is nothing wrong with the dvd. The 1 is actually for the movie.i love Murray and it was really a pleasure to watch him in many of the scenes doing a lower key of humor. But, NOTHING ELSE WAS FUNNY! The ""america meets japan"" stuff was 40 years old at least.three quarters of the way through i gave up and turned it off.If this gets an academy award for anything it will be right up there with the one given to Kim Bassinger."
1,lost,"I tracked this item and it shows it was delivered, but I haven't seen it, what is going to be done about it?"
2,Not What I Thought,"While I loved the opening shot, the rest of the movie didn't really do anything for me. I don't want to come out and say it was bad, but this movie just wasn't for me. It had it moments, but I don't think I'll be watching this one over and over again."
5,amazing,"i'm writing this review because when i looked at the reviews on this page i saw alot of them that bassically said that this movie was boring and that they didn't get it.yes. this movie is boring if you need alot of dialouge or a loud explosion every couple of minutes to keep you awake during a movie. but this is one of the best and most well crafted films i have ever seen. Two married strangers are bassically stranded in Tokyo and fall in love almost by accident. The ending is perfect for the film. Many people say it doesn't resolve anything and that it's unclear, but that's the point. It leaves you feeling weirdly comforted and you can't figure out why.Just watch the movie. you might love it and you might hate it. but it is most definatly worth the risk."
1,Rip my finger nails off please,"I have watched 100's of movies in the theaters. This is the first and only movie I have ever walked out on. I put up with 1 hour and 15 minutes and I couldn't take anymore. I have never, EVER seen a movie so dragged out. Every scene in the movie could have been accomplished in about 30 seconds and instead they chose to make it 5 minutes. It was amazing. One scene shows Bill Murray walking around a golf tee and then hitting the ball. It literally took 2 minutes for this segment that meant absolutely nothing. I have never seen such a poorly made movie. You would have to see the movie to know what i am talking about. Unfortunately, I wouldn't let my worst enemy watch this because I think it would be cruel and unusual punishment. Save your time and money on this film."
1,One of the worst movies of the year!,"This movie is dreadfully boring. Very slow even in the fast scenes. Not very funny. Hardly any character development. As a matter of fact, the two main characters are the same at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning. This movie is over-rated. I wonder if the critics are being paid off?"
1,Lost in Depression/Perdido en Depresion,"Si desea ver una buena pelicula, creyendo que por haber ganado premios, esta es una de ellas. Mejor busque por otra parte, esta pelicula es una de las mas aburridas que he visto. Sinceramente no vale la pena."
1,Slow and Boring Movie,This movie is extremely slow and boring. The clip shown on the oscars is the best 1 minute of this movie. The rest of the movie is junk.
1,waste of money,"All I heard were rave reviews for this movie, so I bought it. DO NOT buy this movie. Rent it if you dare. It sucks."
1,actors look out windows and America genuflects...,"this straining display of limp pathos should appeal to fans of James Fey's, ""A Million, Tiny, Overwraught, Ill-Contrived, Rich-Boy Pieces of Dung,"" which recently topped out at #1 on the Amazon editors picks for best of 2003. No wonder we're in Iraq- my country is populated by easily led fools: ""Oohhhh! those long shots of faces looking out windows- they were just drenched with inner longing and tendentious malaise, indicative of the character's live, *sigh,* I can't wait for the sequel when he goes back and hugs her again.""whatever... if you think this drivel is 'arty' or 'deep' because it is merely ambiguously insinuative... Do yourself a favor and stay away from Florence, Italy. You won't get it."
1,And I heard it was a comedy...,"I hardly ever meet a movie that I dislike,But this one made me want to run away on my bike.In the theater I almost fell asleep,When it was over my heart gave a giant leap.I normally like movies with Murray, Bill,But this one made me want to scream shrill.'Twas horribly boring, thats what I say,It wasn't even the slightest bit interesting, but what the hay.Now the main actress, yes her,I liked her other movies, yes sure.Why would I want to watch a movie mostly containing people being bored,When to get that sensation I can just look here and there along my ward?"
1,A bad and stupid movie,"My husband really wanted this movie. I thought that it my be good because I loved Virgin Suidies. This was one of the most stupied movies. Why did everone think Bill Murry should get oscar. Even after Shan Penn won a person from the stage said""Sorry Bill we wish it was you. What and inslute to Shan Penn and Johnny Depp. If you are unhappy it will make you more unhappy and it you are happy it will reck your night. Do not buy just rent if you must."
1,Lost In Translation,"This is the very worst, most boring, unfunny movie I have ever seen. Avoid it like the plague. Only reason the rating is one star is zero was not an available option."
1,"I agree,Boring!!!","The people that wright good reviews of this movie must either be critics defending what they said, or freinds of the people who played in and directed this worthless movie. If movies like this were to become mianstreem I'd never go to the movies agian!!! I watched about half an hour of this movie and simply couldn't take any more of it, and I'm usually the type of person that gives these type of things a chance. I'll tell you what, intead of reading reviews of this waste of digital info go buy yourself a can of paint, apply liberaly, watch dry, tada youv'e just had twice as mutch fun as this piece of crap."
1,Lost in Translation,What planet were they on when they nominated this movie for Best Picture and Bill Murray for Best Actor? There is no way this movie is deserving of any awards.
1,BOOOOORRRRRIIIINNNNGGG (Boring),"I'm a movie buff and Lost in Translation gets one lost to the point of being bored to tears. I'm not sure what all the hoop-ha is about, but there are a ton of great movies out that will leave you emotionally entrigued. Try ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" much better movie, great story telling, etc.."
1,Anything lower than 1 star???,"Bill Murray needs to be put out of his misery, and stop acting. This movie was not only racist, boring and horrible, it was racist boring and horrible.The only reason everyone is saying it is so awesome is because everyone else is praising it. This movie needs to be shot and put out of its misery!!!!"
1,Pretentious crap-ola...,"...Offensive to Japanese peeps, features spoiled, self-obsessed non-characters that you couldn't care less about, and is total rip-off of ""Walk, Don't Run"" (Carey Grant vehicle from '66), to boot.Think old Daddy-dearest Francis made Hollywood an offer it couldn't refuse...? Does he actually even HAVE any clout anymore???...And just how DOES a mostly-improvised movie win an Academy Award for Best Screenplay???!!!...Stuff to ponder, kiddies."
1,Unbelievably boring,"I am serious about this: lost in translation is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life! This movie is going to last forever in the eternity of the worst movies ever made. If you don't believe me, please watch it. You are gonna remember me."
2,and the big deal is?,"While this movie isn't bad, I don't understand all the hoop-la surrounding it. Though I don't mind the overall point, or lack thereof, I found it to be pretty boring. It's definitely not the kind of movie you want to watch more than once. Plus, Coppola apparently has a personal bias against attractive blondes. The only people she portrays completely negatively in the movie seem to be blonde American women - first w/Kelly (Anna Faris) and then with the woman near the end who approaches Bob (Murray) in the hotel lobby as he's leaving to say she admires him and is immediately brushed off by him when he spots Charlotte (Johannson). Coppola's intent here seems to be to reinforce the old stereotype of dumb blondes, and this is definitely a turn-off."
2,The stars are for the stars.,"If it hadn't been for Bill and Scarlett, I would have given this thing a big fat zero. These two stars did a brilliant job with lackluster material. Was almost worth watching to see them. Definitely not re-watchable or buyable. (The script was rife with racial slurs toward the Japanese culture which was very offensive.) What was Oscar thinking??????"
2,"If you are depressed, don't watch that movie!","I was very curious about that movie everybody is talking about these days. First of all, don't expect a good scenario because there is none, just everyday banalities. This is mostly about the atmosphere surrounding a very boring hotel life in Tokyo, where two people meet and share their loneliness. I wish that movie could have been shot, let's say in Paris. At least the atmosphere would have been more romantic (instead of witnessing those phony disco clowns everywhere) and with a good scenario, would have been more meaningful. Something is missing in that movie and it would be very presumptuous to even think that movie would get an Oscar for best movie, best director etc... Sofia Coppola could have done a lot better with the two very good actors she had (Murray and Johanssen) but, unfortunately the result is very boring and superficial. It's a nice try though...next time maybe..."
