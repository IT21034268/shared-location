1,new york was never my proud,"One of the most awkward, most rediculous phrases ever sung by anyone. this is an awful album start to finish. almost every review (by magazines etc) bashed this album.. believe those reviews over the customer reviews here that somehow give this horrible thing a positive review.Grade: F"
4,A nice surprise,"I have liked R.E.M. since back in the day - ""Document,"" ""Murmur,"" etc. They have never been awful, but have been average.I think this CD is very good and was impressed. I have listened to all of R.E.M.'s CDs and continue to listen to contemporary quality music (Wilco, Radiohead, Coldplay, etc.) and would categorize this CD as ""above average."" I highly recommend it."
5,very mature souding,"This has got to be REM's most mature sounding album to date. The music is on the low tempo side, the vocals sound great and even the lyrics sound much more polished than many of REMs previous works.Definatly a SOLID release from REM...Good to see these guys still on top of their game."
3,Make it all ok.,"I think an album comes along in your life when it tends to reflect what you are feeling at that moment. Like looking back on something that occurred in the past, but knowing those times are gone & wont come back again. The gift of memory I suppose. This R.E.M. album takes some time to sink in, but it has its moments. I mean if you want something upbeat, go listen to gwen stefani or britney. At first, I thought what a slow, plodding, tedious album for mellowing old farts nearing mid-life crisis, but it's actually very good on those rainy days when there's just little life & energy & f*** else to do & you begin to ponder why there are so many women but you'd rather listen to a good album than bother getting to know one. Or maybe if everyday for you is a rainy day, well you've got yourself a winner. Just lower your expectations that a work of pop art is supposed to be some magic elixir, & the album does fine on its own merits."
4,Unlike anything else,"I bought this CD after hearing just a few seconds of Ms. Bittova's music on NPR's ""All Things Considered."" She creates in the spaces outside what would normally be categorized as classical music. The results are interesting and enchanting, but definitely do not fit neatly into any classification system. I've played it for friends who love classical and they hated it; ditto for the friends who don't love classical. Not sure why I find it so appealing, but I do."
5,Bittova Pleases,"Once again Bittova's sound strikes the ear and pleases the senses. An eerie, superb mix of vocals and violin that will raise the hair on the back of your neck - make sure to have goblets of red wine while listening to this one!"
5,"NO ES UNA DIETA: ¡ES EL ADI""S A LA OBESIDAD !!","Expone la mecánica psicológica del sobrepeso, y la forma en que podemos manejar a quien ha sido un enemigo poderoso y desconocido que nos empuja a la obesidad: EL SUBCONSCIENTE ! Este es EL MEJOR, EL ÚNICO LIBRO VALIOSO PARA DESHACERSE DEL SOBREPESO ¡PARA SIEMPRE !Sólo quien quiera seguir torturado con la obesidad puede dejar de leerlo ! Es el descubrimiento del milenio !Yo bajé quince kilos y no he vuelto a subir nada..Y SIN SACRIFICIO!!Se los superrecomiendo !!"
5,Wisdom of the Ancients,"When I was studying for my Bachelor of Education at the University of South Australia, parts of my studies were devoted to the study of Egyptology and Ancient Egyptian Spiritual beliefs. As a result, I had the good fortune to study one of the chapters from Brandon's book. I must say that I found it absolutely facinating and thought that Brandon was clear and concise in his descriptions. I enjoyed Creation Legends of the Ancient Near East by S. G. F. Brandon very much and I think it offers a great overview of various creation legends. There have been lots of books I have read with similar themes, but I think few explain them as well as Brandon. Additionally, as a lay person, I think any reader can pick this book up and enjoy reading it. I would thorougly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in ancient cultures and their beliefs."
5,Smelled great,"This candle came in excellent condition and smelled great! It makes a great gift!! Sad to know that Yankee Candle ""discontinued"" it...it's a great scent!"
1,SICK SICK SICK!,"I love candles!...particularly Yankee Candles. Sometimes, I will buy a candle having never smelled it before and go by the description. That's the case with the purchase of this scent. This is the most disgusting smelling candle I have EVER smelled. I cannot stand it. My parents and sister like it, so I'm not sure why I hate it so much. It seriously makes me want to gag. If they have it lit on the dinner table, I have to blow it out and take it out of the room. I have no words to describe this scent other than NASTY! There are plenty of better smelling candles from YC. It almost makes my stomach turn thinking about how stinky it is. I'm not surprised this scent was discontinued. I wouldn't even take one if they were giving the rest away for free. barf."
3,Useful For The Beginner,"This is a useful book for someone who is thinking about starting an online business. The book gives a good overview of e-commerce. I liked the margin notes. The resource guide at the back of the book listing all the websites referred to in the book is useful. I found the chapter with interviews of sccessful e-commerce merchants to be the most interesting. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to start a business on the web. The experienced e-commerce entrepreneur, however, will find this guide too elementary. As an ""Unofficial Guide,"" the book purports to give the inside scoop. I found nothing that I hadn't already read elsewhere. This volume is a solid beginner's guide and reference but don't expect to learn any secrets that will put you ahead of the many other businesspeople flocking to the internet."
1,Don't Buy It,"I bought the book on the strength of the excerpts on the back. It is a waste of paper. The information is shallow an very dated. It does not provide any valuable information, even the rhetoric is thin and pale. The ""trends"" are old guesses from the DOTCOM era. AND the ""money saving techniques"" are stale. And I figured this out and I'm just starting a web business. Try TechTV's Starting an Online Business. It's FAR better. Better yet try multiple books and do some deep diving on the web. You know the 3rd 4th and 5th pages when you do a web search. Good Luck."
1,Complete Waste,"The only thing to be learned from this book is if you have a catchy title and access to bookshelf space, you can sell anything, even 414 pages of filler.Among the pearls of wisdom is the advice that you can compare features of different computer brands by shopping at your local computer store. I'm not kidding!I was so insulted by the banality of this book that I was moved to write this review."
4,Start your ecommerce business here,"Good stuff! I looked through a lot of books to help me, new to ecommerce, get going. This book looked promising and was better than expected. Start here and you won't go wrong. It helped me out a lot!"
4,Pacific Vanilla Chai...... so happy to find it here,I got hooked on this chai latte a few years ago; it makes Starbuck's tast like dishwater. Then my market discontinued it and I couldn't find it anywhere else in my local area. I did a quick Google search and was so happy to find Amazon carries it; I now have a supply to last me through the winter!
5,Great deal!,"This decaffeinated version of vanilla chai latte is excellent. It tastes almost exactly like the original, but for those of us who do not or cannot drink caffeine, it is the best alternative!"
5,trai chai,"This is the best pre-mixed chai I've tried. I first found it in a grocery store but could not find it again, so I looked online. I ordered a year's supply."
5,"A delicious breakfast drink, as well as ""anytime treat""","This chai is delicious. In addition, I am most appreciative that there is a decaffeinated choice, since I cannot drink products containing caffein. I often use it as a substitute (for coffee) breakfast drink, as well as a special treat for myself at times when I feel a need for some nurturing after a busy day."
2,Nothing special.,"My own version of a Chai Latte was better than this: leave a bag of chai tea in 1/4 cup of hot water for a minute, then mix it with steamed milk and add a little honey. This is just a sugary drink that doesn't taste anything like a chai latte I get when I'm out. Unfortunately, you have to ""try"" 6 cans, too. I'd suggest passing on this, but feel free to try it--it's not bad at all, just not what I was hoping for, and what I would gladly pay for. My search continues..."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I have been looking for a cheaper alternative to the great tasting Café Escapes Chai Latte, K-Cup's and thought I would give this a try after reading some of the reviews. This isn't bad, but doesn't come close the the Café Escapes. The first thing that I noticed was that it really doesn't smell very good (weird, but that is what I noticed). The taste isn't particularly bad, just not quite what I was hoping for."
5,"perfect---the 12"" version on CD at last!","This is all you'll ever need of ""The Way You Make Me Feel."" You get the single mix and the near 8 minute original 12"" single version on CD, so you can get rid of that old vinyl! Plus, if you don't already have MIchael's DVD singles collections, you get the video in DVD format on te flip side."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!:),I love this song it is my favorite off of Michael's album! it is so good! I also love the fact this single includes the video that is great I love this video to it is so romantic he is fallowing Tatiana Thumbtzen through the streets he will take no for an answer so sweet! also includes a remix of the song:) I love this single buy it if you are an MJ fan or just love music you can't go wrong!:)
5,warm,kept my noggin warm during the winter. good coverage for your ears and wrap around your head. comfy and fashionable in my opinion. :)
3,nice but not well designed,"We expected a dinosaur but we found it only on a small label. The proportions of the hat are not perfect. The size is good and fits 3-6 years old. Looks more like a girls hat than for boys. It is hot and cozy and that the most important thing. Not sure it's worth the price, only the cold winter will tell."
3,TOO SCRATCHY,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND HAD THE SHEET SET INSTANTLY RETURNED. SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY WERE TOO SCRACHY AND ROUGH. I ENDED UP SELLING THEM TO MY SON FOR HALF PRICE AND SEVERAL WASHINGS LATER THEY ARE WRINCLE FREE BUT STILL A LITTLE ROUGH. DON'T EXPECT 400 COUNT CONFORT.
4,Great for the price,"I love these sheets, but my husband thinks they are a bit too heavy. If you like lighter weight sheets these aren't for you."
1,SATEEN Sheets,"I spent an hour on amazon trying to find 2 sheet sets for a king size bed, one blue, one white that were NOT sateen. I want normal, cotton sheets, not weird satiny ones. These say nothing about being sateen in the description or in any reviews, and yet when they arrived today...they're sateen. :( Looks like I'm sleeping my sleeping bag for another who knows how long til I can find some good old normal cotton sheets."
1,Forced Boredom,"This book is not funny. Higgins is not funny. Nietzsche's Joyful Wisdom is not funny. This book, as discussed in the preface, was contracted by a silly university press -- one of the silliest of them all. Then Higgins sat down to force the thing into shape. Every page has the feeling of being forced. There is nothing here that is smooth, natural or even very insightful. Higgins is constantly saying 'I think that is funny' as though her opinion could be worth anything at all. She has to think that in order to fulfill her contract. And who cares about her mental state anyway? The only proof that something is funny is that people find it funny, perhaps. But Higgins is an interested party, so her opinion is irrelevant. In fact, her opinion is worthless here, and so is her book."

2,TP,"Loved the jersey, but have washed several times since receiving(maybe 8-10 times) and the lettering is washing off! Not the quality I expected. Will not order through this vender again."
5,youth shirt,bought shirt was not the size i needed returned and handled quickly and very satisfied with the compasny i was dealing with.
3,Very large fenders,"I have a hybrid Schwinn 26"" bike (target brand). I bought this pair because they are listed for tires that are 2 to 2.125 inches in width; mine are very close at 1.95"". However these are huge. They are about 3.5"" across at the bottom and would not fit my frame. Even if I had bent them to fit they would have looked ridiculous.I sent them back and ordered theWald 952-26 Standard Bicycle Fenders (26-Inch, Chrome). The 952-26 (middleweight) fenders state they fit 1.25 to 1.75"" widths, but clearly they are off too. The middleweight fit fine.Since the actual measurements of the fenders are not available here or from Wald's own site, I would suggest ordering with caution. Unless you have a very large fork opening look somewhere else."
2,"Interesting, but not for class","I purchased this thinking it would be great for my Shakespeare class. It isn't. The editors have made decision about the text that do not match with what seems to have been (right or wrong) standard. Too difficult to follow along. Has a pretty good introduction, but you can get this online and elsewhere. Use Arden or Folger."
4,Great Purchase for Shakespeare Class,I purchased this text used for a Shakespeare class and it was delivered within a week. It's in great shape and has everything I need. For what I paid I feel that I got a very good deal.
2,First Edition was of poor quality,"I have the earlier edition and unless they have greatly improved the printing and binding, I cannot recommend the second edition.In the first edition, the text is tiny. My guess would be that it's 7 or 8 pt type and my weak, middle-aged eyes have a hard time reading it. Also, many times the printing is not complete and some of the words are impossible to read. The text is formatted in two columns and they push it so close to the gutter between pages that you have to grip the book tightly and pull it apart to see the text closest to the gutter. It can be quite tiring.The book is also just too darn thick to read comfortably.So far I've read only the three parts of Henry VI, which I enjoyed. I think I'll not read any more from this book. I've decided to buy each play individually instead."
4,Shakespeare works in Kindle,"Shakespeare is fascinating, however it is not easy for not native English speaking persons like myself. The extraordinary introductory materials and the Kindle Oxford dictionary are a valuable tool to understand and enjoy Shakespeare. Notes on the actual text would help. I imagine they are included in the printed version."
3,As Advertised,"It is what it says it is. A complete Shakespeare without any notes. If you are looking to save a buck, and don't mind the lack of foot notes it can't be beat."
3,Good Complete Shakespeare,"The print is surprising readable in this fairly compact, one-volume complete Shakespeare. It is well organized and more than good enough for this non-scholar to use as a reference book. We also read the plays out of this when the mood seizes us."
1,Shakespeare Spoiler,"Impossible to navigate, poor formatting making it uncomfortable to get a flow off the page. This will put you off reading shakespeare. Check other editions. Complete Shakespeare for 1 dollar? You get what you pay for."
2,Barebones edition (you get what you pay for),"Anyone wanting to quickly and cheaply collect all 39 of Shakespeare's palys can rely on this edition, an inexpensive, barebones Shakespeare. Those seeking in-depth study should be forewarned, the texts are not annotated at all...even difficult words have to be looked up in the glossary in the back. The typical scholarly introductory materials found in the preface and apendices is largely absent. And to top it off, the type is printed in a dark gray ink, instead of black: not that easy to read. Scholars and students should look elsewhere.Update: After using this text in the classroom, I would downgrade my rating to one star. The binding is hardcover, but the its quality is inferior. Out of ten students in the course, three had books that were falling apart after just two months."
4,An All-In-One Shakespeare,"This new edition of Oxford's standard anthology of Shakespeare's works has been expanded to include a new general introduction and introduction to each work, an essay on Shakespeare's language, and a new user's guide, among other original features. This favorably reviewed new edition of a classic is a superb way for libraries to provide attractive access to all of Shakespeare's works and introduce these classics to today's readers. (South Texas Library System summary)For individuals, I'd recommend getting each work in a separate volume, preferably one with more notes on each play. When I studied Shakespeare in college, having an annotated edition really opened up the writing to me."
2,Believe what other reviewers said about this book's binding.,"I own and have read thousands of books, and this Oxford edition of Shakespeare's complete works is by far the worst bound book I have ever come across. I had pages falling out of my copy within days of using it. Oxford University Press should be ashamed for binding this book so badly. If you want the text of the Oxford edition, then buy the hardcover Norton Shakespeare, which uses the text of the Oxford edition. Better yet, check out the RSC Complete Works, edited by Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen and published by Modern Library."
1,Not for students or new readers of Shakespeare,"Lack of glossary or footnotes, as well as scant (one-page) introduction to each play make this compilation more suited to the Shakespeare veteran than to the casual or even novice reader. I regret not checking out The Pelican Complete Shakespeare before buying this."
2,Still not worth it.,"The first edition was incomplete and the Wells/Taylor team made editorial ""choices"" based on disproven assumptions and information. Unfortunately, despite this and the continuing lack of a *decent* glossary, the second edition isn't any better. Well-known FACTUAL ERRORS are still not corrected and the editors seem to feel they can take just about whatever liberty they fancy with Shakespeare's words (especially with King Lear) and nobody will notice.If you want a quality edition, spend more and get the Riverside or Arden due to their accurate and intelligent decisions over text discrepancies, insightful commentary and extensive glossary."
4,Cheap Alternative to an A/C,"The fan helps a lot when it gets hot during the day.I also like the fact that it has a timer because it gets kinda cold at night. Overall, it's a cheap alternative to an A/C."
4,Helped a beginner,Bought this book for my daughter who is a beginner and she caught on to playing within the next week...very helpful
5,The Joy of Painting,The instructions are clear and easy to follow with beautiful results at the end of each project. I reccomend this to anyone interested in the wet on wet technique.
5,What a life,helen gurley brown should be an inspiration to anyone struggling. she proves you can start at the bottom but end up on top. this is a great video that covers a remarkable life. a treat.
5,Super easy to install and better quality than the original,"Both of my trailer drain valves failed after a dozen + years of regular use. I wanted to replace them with a higher quality valve and this Valterra fits the bill perfectly. Changing them out couldn't be easier, 4 bolts to replace but make sure you thoroughly flush and drain your tanks and dry out overnight. This makes the unpleasant prospect of getting dripped on much less likely. Be sure to wear rubber gloves and follow the instructions."
5,help for a stuck valve,No one want a stuck black water valve. We can use force to open the valve but closing it is another problem. YES you can take it to a repair shop and pay a service call and full price for their dump valve. I was able to replace my valve in under 30 minutes. I used common tools to do this. BUT make sure you have an empty black water tank and have flushed it out first.
2,Boring,"My grandson,who loves pirates, has nothing to do with this toy. Maybe an older kid would like it. It sits under his bed, unused and un played with."
3,Thought it would be a winner,"I bought this for my older son when he was 2 in an effort to spark his imaginative play. Over the past nearly three years, he never played with it, not even once for more than a couple minutes. I saved it and introduced it to our younger son, who is also not the least bit interested in it. This surprised me, as he likes pirates and has very different taste in toys than my older son. But this toy was also NEVER a hit with other children when we had families over for playdates. I am a bit baffled that all the reviews are raving over this toy. It is very cute, well made, and appropriate for play when babies are present, but it does not really do very much, which may be why my sons seemed to find it ""boring"". Perhaps children who really enjoy imaginative play would benefit most from this ship."
5,Great Toy!,"This is a great toy for your toddler or preschooler. The parts are strong and solid, the colors bright and vivid. We gave it to our youngest son on his second birthday. He and the 9 month old neighbor had a ball taking the people in and out, opening the door in the back, and making the parrot sing or make noises. In fact, this was one of my first Little People purchases and my son plays with it enough to warrant purchasing some more Little People play sets. I'm sure it will look as good a year from now as it does right now, and even my 9 year old will jump in and play with it when my 2 year old is playing so it's something they enjoy together as well."
5,Great toy!,"My son got this ship for Christmas the year he turned 3. Now, over a year later, it's still one of his, and my 5 1/2 year old daughter's, favorite toys. Lots of activities aboard ship and plenty of room for imaginative play. It even survived a voyage down a spiral slide into a mud puddle with no ill effects!"
3,Okay...cheaper at Target,"This pirate ship is originally $25 at Target and on clearance for $17 now. The ship is sturdy and if you press down on the parrot, it does alternate between the sound of a cannon ball, a song, and bells ringing. My 18 month old daugther isn't too interested in it - like she is with her other LP toys. In addition, I really dislike how the 2 LP Pirate Figurines included are BOYS. Why can't we have a little girl pirate? I actually bought a LP Wonderwoman figurine and put it in her ship for her just to show her that little girls can be pirates, too. :) I'm hoping when she's a bit older she'll appreciate it more. Overall, if you get it for $25 and under - a good buy."
4,CUTE SHIP.....,"This is a really cute ship from the Little People line. The only downfall is that the pieces do come off too easily and get lost, like the crows nest and flag. It is not as much fun as I had hoped for, but my little one does play with it. Just a little boring for busy minds, but my older son uses it more to play with his Pirates of the Carribbean ships and stuff, so it does get used. for my toddler it is still in the 10 ten favorite toys. So for these reasons is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is a very nice toy, well built, made to last."
4,ARRRRGH!!! This was a hit,"This was a 3rd Birthday gift for our grandson. He is all about pirates, so he really enjoyed this gift. The little people are great for his little hands. Would recommend this item."
4,Striper Strike = Deadly,"First, I don't have the mackerel finish, but I do have one metallic, one blue flash and one silver flash, all three have caught me stripers. I like the silver flash the most because to me it looks like the eels we have hear on Long Island. For me, the retrieve I like and use most is a slow one with a slight pause, before I pop it, to get it to submerge a little and get the blurp sound it was made to do and 2 or 3 cranks of the handle between pops. Best for surf fishing from the beach or jetty in moderate conditions with a slow to medium current and casts great. Only negative and keeping it from being five stars is the finish wears and peels to quickly after normal use."
3,Almost,"Informative, but not complete. It's like they don't won't the average, hard working man to know exactly how to fix everything wrong with his engine. I learned a lot, but still have to take the engine in for certain problems I'm sure I could do with my tools but the book gave incomplete information on how to fix. A book this at this price should give every detail on how to fix almost every problem with the engine it covers. Am I right?"
3,not specific enough,"I should have purchased a book that was specific to my engine model.This book covers many things,but not in-depth enough, so I had to research certain items to get the details I required.As far as basic service and minor repairs,it will suffice."
5,Childhood imagination at its best,Astrid Lindgren has written many a book which I enjoyed growing up in a small town in the north of Sweden. Her imagination and her gift for storytelling greatly enhanced my youth and follows me now in adulthood. I'd recommend any parent to read this book to their kids and discover that they'll be just as spellbound by the story themselves. Two thumbs up.
4,good service,"Very good service. Book itself is, ofcourse, classics. Lindgren really has gone into the dark side in this one. Great story, regardless."
2,Great adevnture with HORRIBLE ending,"SPOILER ALERT:Astrid Lindgren lost her marbles when she wrote the last chapter. The story is beautiful and as a christian I have no problems reading it to my children as a fantasy rendition. The illustration of evil regimes and quest for freedom is very moving and uncanny in many ways. Worth reading for this alone, but the ending speaks a message that should never have been spoken. The older boy, the hero, would rather kill himself and his younger brother in a suicide attempt, rather than living a life as a cripple. SICK!"
5,Perfect,"There are not many books I read more than once, as a father of 3 these are mostly childrens books. Of all of these no book has made me cry every time like this one does. It is in my opinion Astrid Lindgren's best book. It tells the story of two brothers that face a terrible evil, more so because it is evil like we know, bad people doing bad things. In ways resembling recent wars and tyrants.It is a book ful of morals and lessons. They are not slapped into the readers face or overexplained but they are there and an innocent child can relate to them.The lesson of the book is to do the right thing always, no matter the risk and several more lessons besides. I have yet to read the first 2 chapters and not cry.It is the perfect childrens book."
5,"Oh Brother, Where art thou?","All of my family, most of the children at school, most of the people I have since met, have read this book. In Denmark and generally in all of Scandinavia, Lindgreen's books, and especially the Brothers Lionheart, is held in the highest regard: She has for several years been considered a respectable candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature. So why, oh why, is this most wonderful book not available in an updated english version? If by any chance you get an opportynity to read this book - do so, it will be worth it."
4,Love It!,We were looking for a Faucet that was taller so you can actually get big pans under it. This one is great and beautiful.
3,overall a great deal,"The quality of this set is pretty good for the price, I havent had it that long though and the soap dispenser already broke."
3,leaking at top,Until just recently I would have given this faucet a five star. I loved it. The price was excellent especially for the style. I had this installed about three years ago when we had our kitchen remodeled.It fit beautifully with our new style. Recently it has started leaking at the very top of the faucet when you turn the water on. Can't figure out why it would leak there. I hope we can find a way to fix it because I still do like it inspite of the flaw.
4,"great product, great service, awesome price","i have been looking for a brushed nickel facet for some time and couldn't find what i wanted that was affordable until i found this one on amazon. i could not be any more pleased with the actual product and the service. the facet exceeded my expectations as far as the quality and appearance. the facet arrived 2 days after i placed the order! there have been reviews that complained about the sprayer hose, but i do not see that as an issue and although the unit has not yet been installed, i can tell from the quality of the facet that i have purchased a product that will last for years to come. a similar facet in the home improvements stores cost at least twice as much. i don't usually write reviews, but i was extremely impressed with this service."
5,Great faucet,"very pleased with faucet - sturdy, looks great, arrived fast! I chose to use the soap dispenser instead of the spray in the second ""hole"" and had to locate a ""plug"" at the hardware store."
1,"Looks Beautiful, But LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS","We installed this faucet last December and have had a constant problem with leaking between the fixed base and the Swivel head. At first it was extremely hard to move the faucet between my two sink wells....but, even then, it would leak when at a particular location. Now that it's ""loosened up"" I have a hard time finding a spot where it doesn't leak. Going to have to go with something less ""form"" and more ""function""."
3,It's nice for a widescreen,"I purchased this tv with some doubt. When I finally received it I hooked up everything and wanted to see what thing was capable of. The widescreen for dvd's is great, I love not having any black bars while watching a movie. But, there were shadows in the picture, like multiple outlines to the right of objects that faded out. At first I just thought it was my cable provider, but it was on dvd's and my xbox. So I called Philips and am having a technician sent out soon. They claim it should not be like that, so we will see what happens. I am hoping to save this tv, because for the price you can not beat it! Overall it is a nice set, hopefully this problem is fixable."
4,very good widescreen CRT TV...but no HD,Love the picture quality. Can set it to Wide screen or 16:9 or Super zoom or subtitle zoom or 4:3 or 14:9 modes. Using this for around 3 yrs now and it's exactly how it was when we purchased it. Never had any problems. Sound clarity is also very good but not as great as it's picture. Overall it's a very good purchase.
3,"Fine, but nothing special.","I was glad to find a widescreen TV that I could afford. I've had it for a week and it's fine, but not amazing. I guess you get what you pay for.Pros:-It has a speaker in the center, which I'd been wanting.-Flat screen.Cons:-It's not actually 26""! Apparently someone doesn't know that widescreen TVs are supposed to be measured horizontally--it's only 23"" this way.-The picture needs a bit of adjusting, (it's about 1/4"" off-center).-Once in a while the brightness flicks up a notch and then back down a second later. Weird.PS: Read the reviews of the service plan before buying it! They are not very positive."
1,Can't review TV but can confirm Amazon customer service is good.,"1st set that arrived was obviously a refurbished item and the state of the packing was terrible - the foam case that normally goes around the TV was in bits and haphazardly packed in.So it was no great surprise to find out that the TV didn't work at all!I ordered a replacement from Amazon and was pleased to see that a) they sent the 2nd unit whilst the 1st unit hadn't reached them b) they upgraded to 2 day shipping.Unfortunately, the 2nd unit had a terrible picture & after calling Philips they recommended sending it back so I did.I ordered another replacement but Amazon cancelled the order themselves because they didn't want to send me another dud. They gave me my refund quickly."
3,not satisfied,I have had a vibrating noise in this television since I've got it. I am considering returning it to you.
3,stuttering key issue,I purchased this keyboard recently through Amazon and I like the keyboard but I found that I had a stutttttttering key issue. Every so often I would get a keypress that went ccccccrazy. I found it happened both on my Vista and XP partitions. I have the most recent version of setpoint also. Logitech support had no advice and I did notice some others with the same issue on their support message board. The only solution I found was plugging it in with the adapter to my PS2 port. So it's only the USB that's acting weird. I don't mind using PS2 port but there are a few functions that you can only use on USB.
1,JUNK!,"My cordless Logitech board went kaput after 4 years and I picked one of these up while waiting for my new more expensive board to arrive from Amazon. Soft, squishy keys that felt like they might fall apart under my fingers and the board was actually WARPED. Get back on track, Logitech."
2,Noisy....,"These keyboards are just too noisy for me to think! I like keys with softer, springier strokes. The Logitech is just to clunky. I had replaced the original keyboard that came with my HP computer for this one just because I thought--just by looking at the hp--that the Logitech is more sturdy and comfortable, but now I'm back to the HP. Much better. Plus, Logitech's setpoint software gets worse with every update. The last 4.60 didn't work at all!"
2,Logiterch Keyboard and SETPOINT,"I've owned this keyboard for about 3 years now and enjoyed using it, when the Setpoint program worked. Upon system reboot, there is always about a 50% chance that the portion of Setpoint that applied to the ketboard would not load properly. I tried everything to correct this deficiency, but to no avail. It is very quirky and since it is a corded keyboard, Logitech offers no means to correct it once it loaded wrong, other then to reboot again and hope it loads correctly. I'm in the process of replacing it with a highly reviewed Microsoft corded keyboard and cordless mouse. I might add that once I got my new VISTA equipped computer, Setpoint went from bad to worse."
4,"great keyboard, unexpected details","This keyboard is really fast for typing. i love the design and feel. On a regular set keyboard some of the buttons are larger like the enter key or shift key and on the media keyboard there smaller and gets some getting use to. When i started using the keyboard i noticed that some keys were not in the right place and didn't want to work like it should so i readjusted the keys myself and put them in the right spot. All in all my boyfriend loves it, especially the extra features like the email button and the calculator so i'm satisfied."
2,OK.,"The keyboard itsself is fine. The buttons are placed well, I never had any hardware issues with it after having it for about 3 or 4 years. The software however, is junk. After like 3 new versions the forums are still plagued with people who cannot get the software to display the tab necessary to program the extra buttons. Tried reinstalling over and over, talking to the (Indian) tech support, going through the forums. Nothing worked. If you want a cheap decent keyboard and don't care about customizing the buttons, go for it. I myself am avoiding Logitech from now on since they never addressed this issue after several years and software versions."
5,"Corded, Love it","I'm typing this review using this keyboard. It replaces the wireless Logitech that I had before. I opted to go with a corded key board for two reasons. First, the response time during FPS games and in general seems to be better (this has become less important since my purchase of aFang Gamepad by Ideazon). The second is that it does not require batteries.Regardless, it has useful ""extra"" buttons (some of which are configurable) like Volume control, web browser (plus ""back"" and ""stop""), email, media player controls, and my personal favorite: the calculator (I was getting tired of doing Run... --> calc --> ""Enter"")Additionally, the keyboard has configurable ""function"" buttons similar to a laptop keyboard."
3,A little disappointing,"I bought this album based on an advertisement I heard on the radio for it, because I love The Band, and I'm a pretty big fan of many of the artists on this album. The album was a bit of a let-down, though. The artists featured on the album do a good enough job with their chosen songs, but I haven't found any of these artists' renditions to be nearly as good as the originals. The Band was truly a collection of musical geniuses, and it's just hard to top their versions."
3,Buy the Originals,"As pleasant as the music on "" Endless Highway"" is....and there is alot to enjoy here,not one of this album of Band covers comes close to the originals. New Morning Jacket's "" Makes No Difference"" is really nice but then you go back and listen to the Band's version, you realise a whole depth that isn't there...same with all the others.Enjoy this for what it is and then go to the source."
5,Packaged Genius!,"It just doesn't get any better than this! I guess we'll never know where these guys might have ended up but for Robertson's ego-trip of a final concert (Last Waltz)which (far too) prematurely killed off a great group in its playing and recording prime. Still, as Lennon said to Beatles fans many years ago ""you've still got the records"". This fine tribute is among them!"
3,What is the plane of the golf swing?,"The plane truth about golf is another approach to explain how the golf swing is effected by the path of the club in relation to the motion that the player creates. It is helpful from this stand point of view however I feel if the player, 100 to high 80's shooter stays focus on the plane of the shaft (driver-7 iron) that he or she is swinging they will be more successful in their efforts without to many things to think about. Coach H. Turk Walker"
1,Absolute Nonsense,"What a complicated mess. The classic golf swing is a backhanding action, but one that must be done in a certain way. It is important to find the swing plane that works best for you, but that means very upright or very flat or somewhere in between. To learn how to swing a golf club, I recommend a very simple book called ""The Golf Swing And Its Master Key Explained"" by Noel Thomas."
4,not quite the whole truth,"Hardy does a good job detailing the major differences between the one and two plane golf swings. People who are interested in determining which type of swing best suits their natural tendencies will find this book helpful. This information is not readily available in any other publication and is extremely useful for the golfer who wants to improve their swing. However, if you want to make significant changes to your swing and go for more of a pure 1 or 2 plane swing, then you will need to look elsewhere for additional information. Significant details (particulary on the 1 plane swing)that are missing from the book can be found in the DVD and through Hardy's website ([...]). The book is a good place to start if you don't mind doing some additional research and potentially spending more money on the DVD. If you're a serious golfer then I'd suggest passing on the book and heading straight for the dvd."
1,Buy the paper version,"I own the paper version of this book. I think it is one of the best golf books ever written. I refer to it often. I bought the ebook for travel, since I take my Kindle with me. The paper version has 8 pages of full color pictures of Peter Jacobsen swinging both the one and two plane swings. I like these pictures. Sometimes a quick look at them before going to the course gives me a mental model to carry with me.Two other annoyances. First, there is a copyright notice at the beginning of every chapter. (I don't like being treated like a thief.) Second, the ebook does not have chapter divisions. You can't move quickly from one chapter to another like you can with every other Kindle book that I have.5 Stars for the paper book. 0 Stars for the ebook."
5,The Plane Truth for Golfers,"Excellent, straight forward, presented in simple logical terms and concepts. A valuable book for anyone who wants to learn more about the golf swing."
4,The Plane Trugh,"This book did as it says. It explains the differences between the two swing types well. It really helped my swing and added distance as well. I do wish it explained how to figure out what is going wrong by ball flight, so you can work on that part of the swing, but otherwise it is very good."
2,Innovative Concept,"The concept of different swing planes is a breakthrough for instruction on the golf swing. Jim Hardy is a very reputable golf instructor. I found the DVD set to be very professionally done, but to contain too much explanation. While there are a number of examples and demonstrations of the principles that are presented, after more than 30 minutes of viewing, I found it very difficult to remain attentive to Jim's talkative teaching style. My 2-star rating applies more to the method of presentation than to these remarkable concepts. Other more skilled golfers than I have told me that they LOVE the DVD series. I suspect that experienced, skilled students of this very demanding sport will too. As for me, a high handicapper who has been playing regularly for less than a year, I found it to be ""too much""."
2,Not Easy to Read & Follow,"The golf swing is one of the hardest concepts to convey to a student by direct, personal teaching let alone by words in a book. This book suffers because, well...it's a book! Way too complicated to follow via the written word. Needs better graphic illustrations of the concepts or better yet...produce a DVD with the graphics needed to convey the concepts."
5,The real truth,"Several times but not consistenly I've played golf with friends that were really involved. I've got thousands of advices. Can write a book if I put them all together. I went to an instructor two times with total failure. On sepetember this year my wife and myself took five golf clases w/ PGA Jim Montanaro, based on this book. He explained so simple yet so effective that I've bought it. It confirm all of what I was expecting from it. It is not a magic book. It is better than that because it make one think on what golf strike is based on your own skills. Briefly and togethr w/ jim help affter five clases I hit better than ever. I strongly reommned it."
3,"Good collection, but not definitive....","Short review here...After listening to this set of two discs (A-I and J-Z), I was really pleased with the cross section of artists they served up. I was not real happy with the song selections though. There are far, far better songs done by each artist that could more effectively capture what this set was trying to accomplish.I do have one serious critique of disc A-I: what were they thinking when they put Willie Nelson's ""Blue Eyes"" on there??? I started to sing that Sesame Street song ""One of these is not like the other..."". Maybe it was an error or oversight, but either way, detracted from the disc.This collection will take you back to the yesteryears, but other recordings can do it much better."
2,ANYTHING BUT DEFINITIVE!,"This may look like a great buy, but in fact these are for the most part second rate performances that don't do the songs or their historical period justice. Many sound like they're off the cuting room floor and others are simply ""filler""."
4,great buy for style and price,I just got this dress and it is adorable. You can wear it as a dress or a shirt with jeans or leggins. It is easy to dress up or down. Great buy for the money. Extremely flattering and comfortable.
4,Cute top/Dress,This is very cute casual dress. I agree with some of the other reviews that this will also work as a top. It seems to run true to size (I wear a 10 & ordered a Medium) But it is a little low cut so unless you are trying to be flirtatious wear a cami underneath.
4,Casual Dress,"Suitable for Casual Wear. It's very simple, cool and comfortable. Machine Washable and can be dried in a Dryer."
2,serious sam 2,Was dispointed it did not work with xbox360. It also is one player game if you are not online. No split screen.
3,Background sound missing,I love the episodes but the sound is messed up on several episodes. Should return it but not sure how :( sad I can't use them with my lessons
5,Wonderful!,"I really loved this novel. I read it in 2 days! It had all the elements of a commercially ""popular"" book like romance, suspense and even sex. But it also dealt with important issues like aging, population growth and finding one's identity. Lili Quan is a terrific character - I could really picture her - full of self-doubts, feisty, yet vulnerable - a complicated person, not a one dimentional stereotype. I learned so much about China and how the Cultural Revolution affected those Chinese who were my contemporaries (I am also a child of the 60's). The suspense made my heart race, the ending made me cry a little. All in all, a wonderful story!"
5,Amazing,The lyrics are very appropriate for today even though this is an older CD. The lyrics are timeless and the music is hypnotic. One of my faves forever.
3,/Suave/,"Jon Marsh follows up with more synth fused pop. Catchy hooks, smooth vocals, and solid melodies add up to great tracks like the infectious ""Sweet Harmony"" and ""You've Got Me Thinking,"" with a flamenco style guitar riff that is sweet. Also check out their debut Happiness, which is note worthy."
3,Do you want your Conscience raised?,"Conscience is the 4th album from the UK-based electronic pop duo The Beloved (if you count the 1990 remix album ""Blissed Out) but seems to lack what it's predecessors had. The album starts with the rather lacklustre ""Spirit"" and it appears apparent from this point that Conscience is little more than an unintentional ""best of"" album taking old riffs and breathing new life into them. There are some classic moments such as ""Sweet harmony"", ""1000 Years from Today"" and the more experimental ""Dream On"" but in my mind they will never top their 1987 classic Indie-Pop album ""Where It Is""."
4,Junk,"When 2 teenage children run away from home together, they seek shelter in a squatting den with 3 others. But, the other squatters don't like Gemma, so Gemma and Tar move on, and find themselves under the care of 2 older people.A gripping tale of teenagers being drawn to the wrong corwd, and regretting it for the rest of their lives..."
2,Too Complicated,This book is too complicated for someone that just wants to get started with Frontpage.
5,Should be on DVD....,"I think that this was a great movie to watch. Pebbles and Bamm Bamm finally get ready to tie the knot. Poor Fred does not want to let her go. It goes through all the emotions that some parents go through. I cried when I saw the wedding scene!I thought this was one of the better of the current Flintstone films. This film should be on DVD to enjoy forever... I think that this is a great movie to share with the family and to hold in your heart. It is a wonderful film, and I loved it."
2,Just Terrible,"I am a big Futurama fan...of the TV show.This ""movie"" looks like Futurama and sounds like Futurama. The formula is right, but it is just not funny. Not at all. It's tedious and self-indulgent. It even includes a special feature by the poster child of tedious and self-indulgent: the global warming huckster Al Gore (who wasn't elected President because he couldn't carry his home state: Tennessee).The show is great (even when Bender's robot friend Algore is on it) but this movie is just terrible. I spent $1 renting it and consider it a wasted dollar."
3,"for fans only, a rental","I had read various reviews of Bender's Score before deciding to buy a used copy. For the most part those reviews hold true... this does not have the comedic quality of the series. It does try, but the writing is just not quite there. There are many subtle and not so subtle cameos of characters and events from various old episodes, allowing the fan to smile knowingly. These same references will be a puzzlement to others. The storyline itself is the primary selling point, and it is a merry chase through time and space... something Futurama does without equal. The animation graphics are good, though not as cool as the best of the series or as wonderful as hoped for in a 90 min movie. Bender's Score is definitely worth viewing, but you may want to rent it first to see what you think."
2,"Should be renamed ""Bender's Big Bore""","Being a big Futurama fan, especially of the first 2 seasons, I was looking forward to some classic Futurama. I could not have been more wrong. This should be used as a textbook example of things you should not do when writing comedy for a series. Almost every line is a forced joke, and most of them are reused jokes from past episodes. Just about every character is brought back, unnaturally forced into the plot for reasons I can't understand. The plot is all over the place and has no flow. They dropped the ball, bigtime. I hate to say it, but this was actually worse than a Simpson's clipshow episode. Probably not even worth renting. There is a lot of extra content on the DVD, but I'm not even motivated to watch it, given how bad the movie was."
2,Point me to the nearest suicide booth...,"After about 10 minutes of uncomfortable silence, my friend and I simultaneously looked at each other and said ""I can't watch this..."" As HUGE Futurama fans, it was astonishing to watch our favorite show gasp and wheeze like a fish long out of water. The jokes fall flat, seemingly aimed at 9 year olds. The voice acting seems stilted and the timing is completely off. The orchestral score, which appears intended to give the DVD more of a cinematic feel, was completely out of place and overblown in proportion to the action on the screen. I hardly laughed once during the entire viewing. It was like some cheap knock-off of a show I once loved, with a complete lack of irreverence, visual humor and comedic timing that made the show so wonderful. It left me feeling angry, confused and in search of a suicide booth."
5,Bender's Back!,"I'm a die hard fan, as many people writing reviews here are. I have to say that I was so excited to finally receive my version of Bender's Big Score. I watched it and thought it was good. Not great. I was a little disappointed. I thought it would be funnier, quicker moving, etc. Maybe I was just setting my expectations too high. Whatever the case, two days after my initial viewing, I put it back in the DVD player and watched it again. I found myself laughing a lot more. There were things I missed from the first viewing. It really grew on me. I've now watched it three times and I keep laughing. I think it's classic Futurama. I'm looking forward to more direct-to-DVD movies being released. I hope they bring this back to television soon!"
5,Thank the gods!,"I just received this as a Christmas gift and I have to say I am extremely pleased! When they took Futurama off the air I thought my life was over, but now I can see the light!Basically the plot sees the whole world being taken over by an alien race that scams people via the internet and it is up to the crew of Planet Express to stop them.Using a special time travel code Bender and Fry travel back in time and it's all hysterics from there.I don't want to say anything more about this movie but if you are a TRUE Futurama fan you will really enjoy this movie the comedy is true and the story enjoyable."
5,VIVA FUTURAMA!!!,"Honestly, I wasn't sure if the writing would be up to snuff after two years, but Bender's Big Score proves that the show is still as sharp as ever. If you loved the show, you will be in heaven watching this animated treasure."
1,Hermies big scam,"We are such big futurama fans that we have all the seasons and watch them regularly (they are one of the few things we can agree on watching.)Surprisingly this was something we can agree on watching too, we both vowed NEVER AGAIN.This was bizzare and dreadful, the story is dry and confusing, the characters never do anything funny, exactly unlike the TV show. It has a couple of laugh out loud moments with Zoidberg, but you will really wish you didn't watch this. It's too bad the producers decided to sell out their great legacy for a cheap buck. Unless you are an 8 year old kid who signs onto Amazon to post 5 star reviews and has no powers of discrimination stay away from this movie."
5,Loved it.,"If you're reading this, you're probably already a Futurama fan. So all you need to know is yes, it is a worthy continuation of the series."
3,"Long, Kind of Boring",Bender's Big Score unfortunately did not quite capture the humor and entertaining of the original series. It has a lot of unnecessary character appearances and was way longer than necessary. It was almost as if they didn't do much editing (i.e. they forgot to remove the un-funny parts).I was disappointed but I'm still hopeful that the next release will be better.
2,Four years to prepare and we get a lousy clip show,"I really hoped that four years to mull over ideas would have produced some truly sublime sci-fi and humor. Instead, we get a glorified clip show. Sigh."
2,Where are the Laughs ?,It just wasn't funny and having Bender brainwashed throughout most of the movie took away the words and antics of the best character. Also the plot of the movie was all over the place. They should have stuck to what has worked in the past.
1,Absolutetely NOT like the series!,"I am a huge fan of the Futurama series and was very excited that they were making new episodes. I was very dissapointed when I saw Bender's Big Score. This movie had nothing of what made the series so funny. This tried to do so much, yet accomplished so little. The only cool thing about the movie was how they tied together parts of old episodes, like when Fry's dog is encased, and other little tid bits of the show. Unless you want to see a bunch of non-sense things that connect to the series, this is for you. For true fans, this movie is very dissapointing. Not a good way to start the new series."
1,Below junk,"After the start i truly thought this was going to be brilliant.However, just like the Simpsons movie, it quickly loses steam. The first song featured, ""I might as well jump"", was so childish and poorly written, I couldn't bear to see it! There were too many characters crammed into an overly complex plot, and the new villains were so dull and boring , it was a wonder anyone had thought them up.Don't get me wrong, I ADORE the series, and I loved the ""in jokes"", but I really think they were a mistake. Instead of appealing to those who used to watch the show, they should be appealing to those who have never watched it. They were cancelled once; now a second one doesn't seem so far off."
3,"not as good as the TV show, still good for some laughs","as the title suggests.funny in places, quite cringe worthy in others. My only issue is: At the end of the tv show, its a given that leela and fry wind up together so why did they suddenly wind up single again.yes yes i know, two years have passed but there was no information on it.Anyway, I hope the other DVD's they release next year are better then this one. It was good and i liked out they tied a lot of stuff together from past episodes but really, they could have done this better.BUY IT ON AMAZON!!!"
3,Definitely not Futurama's Big Score,"I love Futurama. I own all of the previous episodes on DVD, and I was very excited to finally see some new stuff.Unfortunately, Bender's Big Score is not like the old Futurama. They have basically taken several new episodes and mashed and interleaved them into a single movie. While this must have sounded like a good idea to someone at some time, it definitely doesn't flow well and it really starts to drag around the half-way mark. It's sad, especially because you can see the threads of the underlying episodes as they weave through the movie and they seem like they would be great on their own. It wouldn't have been all bad if they had an option to just let you watch the separate episodes on their own, but they inexplicably didn't include that option.Overall, it was probably worth watching, but perhaps not worth buying."
3,Benders not so big score,"The shipping on the product was great and fast! As huge fans of Futurama myself and my husband were eager to see a new episode/movie instead of all the old reruns and we were a little disappointed with the result. Having said that, we did enjoy it but just not quite as much as we thought that we would. I would recommend it tho to any fans out there!"
2,nastalgia doesn't hold the show together!,"First and foremost, I want to explain why I gave this two stars. Because I would have given it one, but heck, it IS Futurama. And that's about it. Whatever you remember about Futurama, keep it gold by avoiding this mess. The writing is poor. The one-liners are only kinda funny. Everything seems rushed to make sure everyone gets an appearance while you sit bored for most of the movie. My wife actually turned to me during a painfully unnecessary song and dance (the first of TWO) and whispered ""this really sucks."" The worst part of her statement.. I was about to say it to her!Sorry Futurama lovers across the globe.. It's the cold, hard truth. How many years did they have to perfect this gem? Doesn't matter, because what they gave us was rough and boring. I'm almost NOT looking forward to the next movies.. but I am because they can't get much worse!"
3,Mediocre... Rent before you buy,"Pretty good but still kinda mediocre compared to the old series, not really good enough to hold your attention for an hour. Has become self-referencial just like the Simpsons. A letdown if you expected more and better Futurama that would be free from the restraints of being a 20 minute broadcast sitcom, the ""movie"" is just more of the same with nothing added.Some creator of Futurama seems to think Hermes is really, really funny... I personally do not find the character terribly interesting, but there is lots of Hermes in the movie if you really missed the two joke cliche reggae/bureaucrat. The alien antagonists are very underwhelming, and not very funny either... not a good way to start out Futurama again. I guess people are just happy to have it back after it was ended prematurely."
3,It just wasn't there,"I've been a huge fan of futurama since it originally aired. I was looking forward to this movie since it was first announced. Unfortunately this movie produced a few chuckles, but the number and type of laughs found in the original episodes just weren't there."
4,Fanboys suck,I've been watching Futurama since it debuted on Fox.This movie is good. There is some awkwardness but that's what happens when your productivity is interrupted. This movie may disappoint fan boy geeks who make DVD releases the focal point of their lives. People with lives seeking a little comedic respite should find this a worthwhile waste of their time and money.
3,Typical Futurama humor,"If you like Futurama, this is at least worth renting. It's pretty typical for Futurama humor, but I would not say it's their best work. I don't regret having bought it, but I would have been just as happy to have rented it."
3,Bender returns...,"I love Futurama , the hummor , the irony , the zingers ! and ""Bender's Big Score"" needed a little more of that! Buy it anyway - it's FUTURAMA !!!!!!!"
4,Bender's Big Score,"This was a very good return for Futurama, I thought. Granted, it wasn't excellent, there are some lame jokes and the plot is slightly overdone, but, overall the movie is very good. It was very nice to see Fry, Leela, Bender and the rest of the crew back, and this was a very good return for the series."
5,Awesomeness!,"This is a really good film... Not just one to watch if you're a huge Futurama fans, but something that can be enjoyed by newer fans and people new to the series.Definately something worth buying"
5,Bloody Brilliant! Amazing as ever!,"I was in primary school when Futurama first aired, and it's just as funny now as it was then. I bought this the day it came out, the plott is a little complicated but it's amazingly funny. The only real thing going against it is if you ware unfamiliar with the old television series you would be slightly confused as to whats going on in the film. But for those of us who have been watching it since the beginning this is a must have. As for the rest of you go buy the DVDs of the old show then buy this one! I cant wait for the next film to come out!"
1,Bad news everyone... DVD of most terrible quality,"Having purchased all the other Futurama DVDs R2 from the UK, I couldn't wait for this one so bought this R1 from the US. The DVD packaging is cheaply done and film of terrible quality. Very pixillated. Not my TV or system as other region 1s work perfectly.And the film was totally awful. Very safe, very tame, very unfunny."
2,Love Futurama but this was terrible....,I'm surprised how good these other reviews are. I thought this was a very weak effort. The first half of the movie was wasted dwelling on the two years they were off the air. There was very little story that was engaging and there were odd characters that look like they were drawn by a different set of animators.I'd love for them to bring the series back but the wit seems to have fizzled out in this venture.
2,Not nearly as funny as the episodes,"I loved all 4 original seasons of Futurama, and I ran out and bought ""Bender's Big Score"" the first day it was available. However, I was very disappointed; it just isn't very funny. I think I chuckled only once. I thought that the original writers were back for the movies, but if so, they were off their game this time.Also, it's just not very well-paced; it feels like the took an episode's-worth of content and padded it out to 90 minutes. They tried to make it seem interesting by adding tons of references to the episodes, but it doesn't work.It's worth watching for die-hard Futurama fans, but I recommend you rent it or borrow a copy; it ain't worth 20 bucks. I hope the remaining 3 are better."
4,movie,"box was damaged, appeared to be by a box cutter, it had a gash through about half the length of one side. the DVD was undamaged and plays fine. i recommend the DVD to anyone who likes futurerama."
4,weak start but it got better,"It did not have the same SPARK as the old days, but it got better. For a full movie, I hoped the animation would have been better. It was funny and smart. Im glad its back. Im glad Al Gore was in it. Worth the money."
3,Not my favorite,"I am a massive fan of the Futurama series, but this movie was a big disappointment. It wasn't very funny and rather forced. I thought a few aspects of this movie were really great, but I didn't like it overall. I own all three of the movies - but the second and especially the third installment trumped this one. This has a very wimpy and awkward segway into the second movie, but only as an afterthought. I only bought it because I am a true Futurama fan and own every episode from their series and all three movies."
4,"My own Futurama, with blackjack! and hookers!","Mmm. Tasty Futurama. How I have missed you.You have come back to me after years apart. Unfortunately, I can tell that your writers have not remained faithful. There are brief hints, albeit many of them, that show that your writers have pursued other projects, and did not spend our long nights together practicing dialog for Bender, Fry and all the rest.But not to worry. You have still warmed the cockles of my heart and tickled my funny bone. Like always, you manage to convince me to suspend my disbelief and follow along with your parables on the dangers of modern society.You tried to keep it subtle, but I saw that moral you introduced. I recognized that this whole production is either a warning not to play with time travel, or to not give out your personal information over the Internet.Oh, Futurama, how I have missed you."
3,A long-awaited and overly complicated return,"I've been a fan of Futurama for years, and continue to rewatch episodes all the time. The movie served as the long-awaited return for a show that was cancelled in its prime, but they made the plot too complex with not enough old-fashioned humor. The reason everyone loved the show was because you sympathized with the characters, but in the movie they're all far too one-sided and only in scenes for split seconds before they move to another plot line.It just seemed like the writers attempted to recreate the success and humor of the episodes ""Farnsworth Parabox"" and ""Roswell that Ends Well"" with the plot, but couldn't quite recapture the enjoyment. I'm glad the shows back, but I'm hoping they can get the show back on track before those execs at the Box Network cancel them again."
2,What a Disappointment!,"I LOVED the series, and waited for this with bated breath: God was this lame! The weakest episode of the series was heads above this. It was really bad and hard to sit through. SIGH!"
1,Bender's Big Disappointment,"I'm a big Futurama fan, I own every season on DVD and have watched every episode probably four times. I didn't have unreasonable expectations for this film, I just hoped it would have some of the same wit as the series. Unfortunately, it didn't.With the series, I'd nearly cry in laughter at points by the clever well-timed jokes, but the movie had me giggling only twice during its duration, and I almost took a break half way through because it was so boring.On the upside, the story and complex tangled plot-line were a little interesting, but this movie just isn't funny.Here's hoping it's a warm-up for the next film (which I'll rent before I buy because of this disappointing showing)."
4,Futurama is back,"It's great that Futurama is back and I really enjoyed this DVD.The only problem I have with the movie is all the time travel! So many paradoxes! I would have preferred a 'linear' storyline but hey it was fun and as it said once in an opening credit title ""You can't prove that it won't happen""."
2,Not that good,"I'm a huge fururama fan, but these episodes were not that funny. I wouldn't rate them as high quality on plot or creative jokes as the original TV series. It seems like they sat down and cranked out a few episodes to create some DVD sales (are all the original writers on this one?). Fans and non-fans will be slightly disappointed."
3,"What's in our future, FOX?",Eehhh... it was okay...now keep Family Guy cancelled like it supposed to have been and bring back Futurama!!!
4,This review is Carbon Free!,"It starts off strong... loses a little steam midway and pays off pretty well in the end. At least I thought so. But it's not all roses... The songs are in my opinion horribly, cringe-worthy lame... I tolerated the singing in the episode where they went to Robot Hell pretty well, but this time, I winced. Some of the alien machinations seem kind of just there to push the plot forward, but this is nothing new for Futurama or it's cousin The Simpsons, whose movie I was a little less enchanted with on the whole earlier this year. To be frank, I don't think the movie format fits either the Simpsons or Futurama. Anyway, this is the first of four, so maybe it's just the shakedown cruise!!! 4 stars- minus one for lame songs, some general creakiness and flatness. Warning: If you are not into Futurama already, start with Futurama Season 1 first!!!"
2,Did I expect too much?,"Don't get me wrong, I love Futurama and I am very glad it is back, but this movie left a lot to be desired. The writing on the original series was tight, full of one liners and wonderfully dry humor, while this one felt like the writers were tied to a chair and forced to make one 22 minute episode into four. There were some very funny parts, but they were few and far between. I really don't think I was expecting much in the way of comedy either, as my favorite episodes are the character driven, newer ones (""Jurassic Bark"", ""The Sting"", ""Roswell That Ends Well"", and ""The Devils Hands are Idle Playthings""). I will continue to faithfully follow Futurama, but I hope for better things in the future."
3,"Not Bad, But Definitely For The Fans","I wasn't let down; if you're a fan, buy it, buy it now, maybe two copies. Supposedly we'll get four more of these, and if you're like me, you can't comprehend how Family Guy got revived while Futurama sat fallow these long sad years. All that said, this is a little long, a little light on jokes, and a little heavy on series references and in jokes for fanboys. As a fanboy, I love it, but if you don't know every episode inside and out, you might not be down. The villains are truly disgusting to look at; the letterbox format doesn't fit the format all that well; and the lines turned jagged and funky on my copy. Not the homerun we'd hoped for, but we'll take what we can get. The disc is worth the price for the full length episode of ""Everyboyd Loves Hypnotoad,"" perfect to have on screen in the background of drunken parties. Commentary throughout as always, and the geekiest extra ever: a Futurama math lecture make this a must by despite the flaws."
5,It won't stay dead!,"Great to see the Futurama is back, and I'd say that it seems that they lost none of their great wit and humor in the layof. It's clear with so many story lines that they are planning to splice this movie for TV, but overall I thought it was great - one of the best stories in the series!"
4,Good to see them back,"I think it must be hard to make a feature length film from an animated TV series, but you wouldn't know it based on watching this movie. I really enjoyed it and thought that the plot, especially with all the references to previous episodes, was great. The film is a little confusing, but I don't think it's particularly important to try keeping track of everything, especially since it is all explained. I thought the film was just as funny as most episodes, though I personally wished that Zap Brannigan appeared more often."
4,Adequately Satisfactory,"Good stuff. Doesn't compare to episodes such as ""The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings,"" but worth watching. And watching. And probably watching again."
5,Excited!,"I had NO idea that this was even being created! I just happened to be browsing for future purchases, visited Futurama which I plan to buy the series eventually and to my surprise I found this! I must say that I am very excited to see Futurama coming back at least in a sense!"
4,Spanish!!!!!!,"Yes, Futurama is back but this time it's only on an English version. We latams will miss A LOT the spanish version specially 'cause the earlier season releases came with it and I have to say, it's a lot better than the english version. It's really a shame, but hopefully will wait for a spanish release on TV. Anyway Futurama will always be my favorite cartoon serie ever..."
2,Would have been better as 4 30 minute episodes...,"Weak. Futurama simply failed to translate to an epic movie.It isn't horrible, just too damned long and tedious.Would have been superior if they had spent the money on creating three or four separate 30 minute episodes built around a central plot.If you felt that the Simpson's failed to translate to a full length movie successfully (I did -- but it was still entertaining), this movie will be a disaster of an experience for you.The 20 minute hypnotoad is a definite win, though."
5,Absolutely Brilliant! Just buy it now!,"If you liked the series, you'll like this DVD. If you loved the series, you'll love the DVD... if you hated the series, I'm surprised you made it this far down the page... what's wrong with you, anyway?The creators of Futurama lived up to the series with this DVD release. It's just fall down funny for the entire length of the film! Just buy it, and watch it - you won't regret itLong live Futurama!"
5,Finally! Futurama Returns!,"This is the best adult cartoon ever created. I could care less about the Simpsons but this show is excellent. This movie is awesome. It's been awhile since I laughed as hard as I did while watching this. The best parts are that all the voice actors are the same and it FEELS like Futurama; as if this was just the next episode in this cancelled series. The DVD includes several bonus features-some great, some blah. Overall if you love Futurama or even just watch it when nothing else is on the tube, you should pick this up."
3,Futurama - Bender's Big Score,"Viewers Log, Scar Date 01/23/08:The story plot does not parallel the same tongue and cheek format as the series does. The writers went overboard creating a complex story line that seemed to have lost it's silly humor factor. It was an over zealous attempt to wrap up all the loose ends from the series and served to prove that there is no future for Futurama. ""Good news everyone"" ... I have the entire series on DVD!The needs of the few outwieght the needs of the many.Doug"
3,too long!,"I love Futurama, but this is a bit excessive. Would rather have seen a series of episodes rather than a long movie. The jokes were okay, but spread thin."
3,Not the greatest but still a proud fan of the show...,"Like many loyal fans I was very happy to understand that more episodes of this series were being produced. I plan to see them all. I rated this recent effort 3/5 stars because the typical humor I have grown to enjoy from the televised series was absent (or atleast reduced). I can't really put my finger on it. Maybe the longer duration caused the humor to be diluted somewhat. I think the storyline was okay but the writers attempted to ""Geek-it-up"" too much by referencing today's internet society and norms. The spam/internet/identity theft references were humorous but not enough to carry the whole program. The time travel plot was intenersting and how it tied together wild diverging storylines to make sense - in the end. But be warned that the storylines will be all over the place until the end."
1,Is this the Pilot?,"Futurama - Bender's Big ScoreBy far the most horrible episode of Futurama ever. I am such a fan of Futurama and when I found out this was going to be released I could not wait to get a copy. Sitting through this was an unbelievable boring, unfunny, and slow ordeal. I recommend that this is a rent grade DVD. Something is really off with this DVD, so off in fact that I thought I was watching a pre-pilot episode."
1,Bender's Big Waste of Money,"I really have no idea what movie most of the other reviewers were watching, it certainly wasn't the complete waste of time I just finished watching. The original was funny and innovative, this movie just seemed like lots of rehashed jokes from the original series which, when all smashed together, are not funny or interesting.I can not recommend that anyone purchase this mess. I had to give it one star, because no stars is not a permitted option."
2,At least the voices are similar...,"Definitely not as good as the original seasons. Not really worth buying on DVD, but worth watching when the episodes come to TV.While I absolutely loved the original seasons, this is an obvious attempt to cash in without actually devoting any resources to making it worth my time to watch."
1,*silent sobbing*,"i'm a massive futurama fan and this movie was just a big letdown. its just a collection of references to jokes made in past episodes. its good that people rally behind futurama and supported this release, but the content of the movie itself is so poor compared to the quality of the actual seasons. there needs to be more of a movement for the show to get picked up again by a network and screened again in episodic format instead of saying the movie is good (when in actual fact its horrible - which is the general consensus outside of amazon) in order to keep the futurama people sustaining their input.i give it no stars. so very very bad. - annoyed fan"
2,Worst Futurama EVER,"Some episodes of the show are better than others, but even if you took the plotline of this VERY stretched-out movie down to a normal 30-minute episode, it would still be the worst episode ever. Very few laughs, virtually nothing that's clever, and the voice actors are all out of practice. Not to the point that they sound like different people, but without the energy they need to pull this off. Worst of all was the writing, though. No wonder this went straight to video! The distributors wouldn't put it in a theater, or spend money promoting it once they got a look at it. Trajic waste, too. This was the chance for them to reboot the entire series, but they fumbled."
2,A disappointing executing of the exciting return,"I'm a huge Futurama fan, so I gathered several friends to watch this DVD the day it came out and was very disappointed. The movie doesn't have the same creative spark that most episodes of the TV series did. The plot is great and leads to some funny situations, but the little inserts of humor were often unimaginative and dropped too often into stale toilet humor. Even the songs were mediocre. Between the 5 of us watching, there were very few laugh-out-loud moments, and the chuckles were not nearly as frequent as in the TV series. I think we got more laughs out of the Everybody Loves Hypnotoad special feature than the movie itself. I'm definitely glad that Futurama is back, but I hope they have much better stuff in store for us than this lame attempt."
1,Bender's Big Flop,"I like the Futurama series, but the movie release just didn't come up to the quality of the TV shows. It was crass without being funny. I won't waste my money buying the rest of the direct to DVD movies."
3,Really for die hard Futurama fans!,"The movie has a great story, some good twists. Everything is almost the same except one thing: the jokes. I found myself not laughing as much as when I watched the tv episodes. But its still good, I think the next movie they'll be fresh with the jokes, because they won't have to focus so much on the complex time travel stuff..."
1,Heartbreakingly horrible.,"I was so excited to see this. The first few minutes (poking fun at Fox) were giddy glee. Then the ""story"" began.It just plain was not compelling. It felt like if you asked a machine to write a Futurama episode. The characters and jokes and themes were all there, but it seemed like a fake sendup of Futurama.Heartbreakingly horrible."
3,Not what you would expect from Futurama,"After watching Futurama reruns for a while, I was really excited about this film. After watching it, I was not particularly impressed. There are some good scenes and lines, but it lacks the great humor of the tv show. I would recommend borrowing this movie from a friend or library."
3,"I would totally buy Season One of ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad"". Seriously.","It's nice to have the ""Futurama"" crew back, even if they did seem a little challenged by filling up all the space in a feature-length format. The opening gag, with them taking a jab at the ""Box"" corporation, was hilarious, and there's a lot of fun bits about mucking with the space-time continuum... Mostly, though, this seemed pretty slack and padded-out.However, the real gold here is the bonus feature full-length episode of ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad"" (from the third season). I don't know why, but I LOVE that show! (No, seriously!) I have watched the Hypnotoad episode three times already. Would love to see more. Need to see more. Must see more Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad. Hypnotoad........"
4,"Call me crazy, but I liked this.","Dispite being a cheesy cartoon and not being 100% correct on the edicate of time travel, it's still a fun story for adults and kids. I really enjoyed it."
3,VERY POOR PACKAGING!!,"WARNING WHEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT: When you purchase this product, it would be best if you purchased a plastic one-disc empty DVD case. The packaging this item comes with is a poorly constructed DVD case made from a thick card-stock-like paper that is very tacky-looking and easily damaged. It is very poor quality, and if I could tell the people who designed it, I would tell them to shove their design up their own butt-holes.When I received this item the DVD case was wrinkled and damaged, but luckily the disc inside wasn't damaged and worked fine when I tested it in my DVD player. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU TEST OUT THE DISC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is because I like Futurama. Very poor design."
3,Not detailed,"I just received this map and I see it isn`t going to do me much good. I already have a Guia Roji highway atlas, and ordered the Edo JAL map for more detail on the small towns and back roads in western and northern Jalisco, but the state map actually shows less than the atlas does. Well, at least it`s smaller and more portable, so I`ll hang onto it and it`ll save me from having to drag the atlas around and flip through pages for 90 % of what I need. It looks like I`m going to have to figure out exactly which INEGI maps cover the areas I most need and shell out for those. OMNI Maps (prompt and accurate service) carries those too, hopefully they will be able to explain better over the phone because I can`t see enough from the reference map on their website to tell which ones cover the zones I`m interrested in."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my then 15-month-old daughter. She gets no thrill out of it whatsoever and it is one of those toys that has been tossed to the side. The blocks don't really 'lock' in place so that you can see what animal noise, etc. is being said, so it can be confusing for a child who is learning the new sounds and letters. The only good thing is that it sings the ABCs... but I could do that myself and could have saved myself $12.99."
2,"Really a lovely voice, but...","it definitely lacks expressive quality, particularly on the classical pieces. Her dynamics are appropriate and fine, but it's a very one dimensional sound. Her long notes have a beautiful tone, but they don't move anywhere. They just hang in the air waiting to meet their ends. Listen to Cecilia Bartoli's rendition of Sposa son disprezzata to hear what this piece sounds like when it really is brought to life. I'd love to hear Summer's tone with Cecilia's passion...."
1,Is she falling asleep ?,"Bought the album because it had all of my favorite selections, nice orchestration but her vocalization is totally without feeling...and beautiful music without feeling is a waste..nice voice but boring ..."
1,Disapointing,"As a once an admirer of Bernard Lewis, I find this book oversimplistic in it's nature. It seems it was written to misinform the public which is a departure from Mr Lewis's previous work."
1,Betrayed,"I was looking for something insightful when I spent a lot of money on this book, but I found myself frustrated, manipulated, and misinformed from beginning to end. I could not believe that the author would actually refer to the reader as ""us"" when he made his profoundly biased claims against Islam. What kind of ""academic historian"" would use the words ""us"" when speaking to the public at large on such a divided issue? I also can't believe how many five-star reviews were listed for this book. I'm highly suspicious because the overall distribution of the reviews of this book are unbelievably bimodal. What are the chances? Look for yourselves. Something fishy is going on here. I'm not an academic and I'm not a muslim, but I was deeply annoyed by this author and the disservice he has done to humanity. He's not even a good writer."
3,Open Questions,Lewis' basic premise for why Muslims are so angry with the West is that they always have been. Specific examples of things Westerners do to annoy Muslims like supporting Israel and developing and buying Arab oil are just more examples in a long string of examples stretching back to the Crusade. It seems that Muslims hate those who put up a fight. Now I wonder if Muslims still harbor grievances from centuries old conflicts with other civilizations they have conquered or tried to conquer like the Indians and North Africans.
5,Excellent primer on West-Mideast divide,"Bernard Lewis keeps it simple and clear in explaining the history of the Judeochristian/Islamic divide. He clarifies misconceptions of why America has become ""Satan"" in the minds of ""fundamentalist"" (another term which has been misappropriated as explained by Dr. Lewis) muslims. He avoids making apologies for either side; just tells it like it is. Excellent and easy introduction into the crisis of our time (although slightly outdated at this time since it was written in 2003)."
5,This book is still the best,"This book is still the best for those wanting to know about the crisis of Islam from an outsider's point of view. (Go for Akbar Ahmed's Islam Under Siege for the best insider). Christopher Catherwood, author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED IRAQ (Carroll and Graf 2004)"
2,"Terribly inaccurate, one sided and misleading","I will not go into the details of the book otherwise the allowed 1000 words would not be enough.Do not be impressed by the prestigious academic position of the author, or by his vast historicalknowledge, which he employs to convince the readers with his superficial analysis. It doesn'ttake much effort to find out how emphasis is placed on certain issues inappropriately. By doing so,apples are mixed with eggs all the time. The book is full of contradictions, half of the truth -most ridiculously in Chapter 5.If you are seeking a compact, and thus not comprehensive, lesson of Islamic history, this book mightbe useful, and therefore, two stars. But if your aim to learn something about the political evolutionof the Islamic world, do not waste your time with this book."
1,Propaganda,"Lewis has prostituted his vast knowledge of history in the service of the terribly misguided U.S. foreign-policy stance on the Middle East, which policy is a stupid blunder that will lead to WWIII."
1,Why write a book based on UnTruths?,"This book is a sad depiction of one who has no knowledge of religion and is just trying to make a book about a popular subject, distort the facts, and make lots of money....Don't buy this book... It's a waste of time. Instead, buy something like ""The Islamic View of Women and Family"""
4,An Eye Opener,"For anyone that has ever pondered why it seems that people who follow the religion of Islam hate Americans, this book is the answer to your conundrum. I read this book as a supplement to a survey course in World History, during the Islam unit. Although this book does not get into the advanced study of historical facts, figures, beliefs, etc. about Islam, it does a formidable job of explaining the case for Islam and the origins of their hate towards Americans. It also paints a great picture of the origins of the religion, how is it closer to Christianity that the lay person thinks it is, and why America is branded as the ""enemy"" in their culture. If you have ever wondered, this book is the answer."
4,"worthy, if flawed, intro to current events","THE CRISIS OF ISLAM mainly concerns itself with the past one or two hundred years of conflict between Islam and the West. Lewis does a good job of detailing the various bones of contention, and spares no one in assigning blame to the current mess. His outlook for the future is dire, indeed.Like his previous book WHAT WENT WRONG?, THE CRISIS OF ISLAM packs a lot of information into a slim volume, yet suffers from being too sketchy at times, so that the reader unfamiliar with the finer details of Middle Eastern conflict is forced to do further research in order to understand his arguments. It doesn't help that there is the occasional sentence that is awkward and unfocused. Still, worthwhile for those looking for some background into the current Mideast situation."
4,An Objective Insight,"I was looking for a book on the Middle East crisis that provided more depth and insight than what was available through television pundits and daily news reports but could be read without a huge time commitment. This book fit the bill. It can be read on a Sunday afternoon and, considering its' core is some previously published articles melded together, it reads very well.I appreciated the author's objective critique on the subject and felt he did an excellent job of assessing the pulse of the rest of the world, especially Europe, and their views on 911 and the Middle East."
5,A good basic overview,"This is a great primer for learning about the Middle East and Islam as a whole The book is only 170 pages long which is nice in that it gives you a quick and easy, general understanding of the topic. The reader should be aware however that no book can claim in 500 pages to explain an entire religion and an area of the world much less in 170. This book is simply a good jumping off point to getting a better understanding of the historical context of Islam and the Middle East."
3,crisis of islam,"The book has been well written for most of the part of the book. Towards the end of the book, in the last couple of chapters onwards, the author, in my view, seems to have tilted towards trying to say that the Christian world that is fighting the terror is correct. The major part of ""Terror"" or ""Crisis"" that is seen today in islamic world is also because of the western (christian) powers who have tried to impose their views on the whole world. Except for this small portion, the book makes a quite interesting read"
5,Professor Lewis - a true scholar,"There are no stones left un-turned by Professor Emeritus Lewis! His wisdom and expertise are completely engaging as always. I've read all his books and it is true that they're heavily academic, but they are circumferential and complete with minimal un-checked opinion. Be prepared to contemplate and drop your concepts about life in the Middle east."
2,Disappointing but still worth the read,"Disappointing simplification of Arab American relationship or lack thereof, its link to the decline of Islamic political power and the frustration of Muslims. Mr Lewis is successful in drawing up a picture of failures of Islam through the American prisms. Unfortunately, the arguments must be viewed in a broader context to be credible for those of us who have also lived outside the US. His linking of Islam hostilities to the Nazis and the Soviet Union is a bit weak, although some truth could be found in it. Overall, an interesting book for those who want to understand Americans' misconception of Islam written by a scholar within the middle of it."
1,I'm not a Muslim but I can recognize bias.,"I lived for years in the Middle East and after reading this book I can tell you that this ""historian"" comes with an agenda. It may be his jewish cultural background or whatever, but he only seems to have a cursory and simplistic understanding of Islam and Muslim thought. Of course saying that some Muslims could care less about ""The West"" or Israel and just want to be left in peace would not sell many books.Take it from someone that has been there. Most people in the Middle East are no different from you given similar circumstances."
1,Completely unfair and biased,"Although Lewis does make several legitimate points, the overwhelming majority of this book is right-wing, anti-Islamic, pro-American rhetoric. Some of the ""points"" that he makes are so ludicrous that they are down-right laughable. For example, the Crusades are the only example of violence in Christianity, and even that wasn't so bad? Yeah, I'm sure."
2,Whatever!!!!,"The contents of this book are extremely offensive. I'm a muslim and from my point of view this book is biased. Lewis generalizes way too much. Sure there are some muslim extremist but what religion doesn't come with it's share of bad apples? If Islam is so ""evil"" and whatnot then how come even today you find old churches from way back in muslim countries yet in christian or jewish countries you only find ruins of what was once mosques? It's because Islam is a tolerant religion, and always has been, that's why. Again, what religion doesn't come with it's share of fanatics?"
3,Not one of my favorite books,"This was recommended reading for us before we deployed to Iraq in 2005, but quite frankly I didn't think that much of it. While the author has some interesting points I found many of the arguments he made self-defeating and some of the history behind his assumptions invalid."
5,Why Islam needs to move into the 21Century,It is important to understand the downward spiral that the middle east is going into by grasping at an era that has no place in the modern world. It is time the US ends it's unholy relationships with dictators and Islamic fanatics and helps the innocent people of that region who are caught up in the middle of things. History has called the US to save the world once more and it is now time to answer.
4,Farman the Master,"When I first picked up a John Farman book in a bookstore in London, I was hooked from the beginning. Mr. Farman makes history fun for kids and adults alike. In this book, he explores the history of technology from the Greeks to the present day. This funny and informational book is one of his finest works of literature."
5,Ugly cover; Great anthology,"I really enjoyed the first anthology in this series. After seeing the cover of this second book, I was afraid the series had taken a turn for the worse. The first volume was so expansive!and this cover seems so focused and limiting. I bought it anyways: everything Nicola Griffith has worked on has exceeded my expectations, and I decided to trust her.Boy was I justified.The cover of this book suggests that it's ""gay fiction."" It is, but more importantly it isn't. What it is is a series of remarkable stories that deal with queer themes, from the points of view of straights, queers, and all those real people who lie somewhere inbetween or beyond these labels. Regardless of the themes, you aren't going to be reading a better SF anthology this year. If you're at all interested in having your notions of gender and sexuality expanded, then READ THIS BOOK (and if SF isn't about the expansion of notions, then what is it?)."
1,Kiana......the COWGIRL?,"Puh, Wild West, I think not. This doll is as un cowgirlish as it can get. First off, cowgirls aren't skanky little sluts. They have class. And no one can ride in horse in these tacky outfits they dress them in. Yeah, you can say ""well they're just dolls they aren't supposed to be realistic"". If they hadn't made horses for them that wouldn't had bothered me as much.PLus, this doll is just crappy. My younger cousin has one and when she tried to brush the doll's hair half of it fell out. Do not buy this doll, spend your money on something good."
1,I am Sooooo Sick Of My Scene Haters,"I hate when you guys messing around with my scene. What? Do you think she is a role model? WELL, i WOULD SAY yOU Are crazyyy!!!! yOU should see her skirt. It is way toooooo short. My scene designer didn't make an outfit as short like that. You should see all Bratz outfits. They are tooooooo sexy. And I'm sick of the MISSPELL words. Instead of spelling BRAT, they spelled Bratz and instead of spelling ROCK, they spell ROCKZ!! And some other trillions of misspell words. Okay so I hate Bratz or should I say brats, what are you going to do about it? Kick me at the shin? Well try it! I am half way of the earth. My country have two seasons only. Well that isn't a problem, the problem is YOU ARE GOING TO MESS AROUND WITH MY SCENE, WELL I AM GOING TO DO THE SAME WITH BRATZ A.K.A BRATS. Ha... Ha...Torryianna"
5,She is my Twin!!!!!!!!!,I can't believe it. There is a Bratz doll that looks exactly like me!!!!! She is great. I am glad that there are more new Bratz dolls. I hope that this doll rocks your world because she definatly rocks mine!!!!!!!!!EsweetieBratz 4Life
4,A Must to Read & Share with Everyone in your life!!!,"Alison is a visionary and this first book exemplifies her dedication to making sure that men are treated with the utmost respect. She is educating women of all ages to be responsible for themselves and to fulfill their needs and then they will be available to give their all to those they love. Her workshops and coaching programs are incredibly informative and it is so easy to apply the knowledge you have learned. This book compliments her work and commitment to getting the word out. I gave this book to everyone that I love for the holidays and they devoured it. Valentine's Day is just around the corner and what better way to say ""I love you"", than to buy this book and spread the word. Alison also has articles available on www.consciousloving.com. Thank you for the immense difference you have made in my life and the lives of others!"
5,Inspiration,All this time trying to figure out men - and Allison Armstrong makes it so easy - so clearand FUN!!The book is aptly named - it really gives you the keys to the kingdom - regarding your relationships with men.
2,"good message, poor writing!","This book appears to have a good message which could have been conveyed in about 15 pages (or less). Yet, the reader has to sift through about 200 pages of an annoying ""fiction"" story that is anything but a ""novel"" writing. I would have personally benefited from this book had the author just succinctly outlined her message - the fiction takes away from her message, and the story is poorly written, and just plain annoying. If you can find the cliff-notes on this book, you would take away a lot more from the cliff-notes than reading the book."
2,Get the book instead,"I am big fan of PAX (Armstrong's company)and I own her book, CDs, and have attended her seminars. I really liked Keys to the Kingdom in the book version, however, friends and family that listened to the book on CD hated it. Not sure why exactly, but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead. Also, you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist. Hang in there though, because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships. I can't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men. Did I also mention that apparently Alanis Morissette is also an Armstrong fan? In a nutshell, get her book, and her other CDs like ""In Sync with the Opposite Sex"". Also, her CD ""The Amazing Development of Men"" is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in ""Keys to the Kingdom"", which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars."
5,I couldn't believe it wasn't me...,"I was fortunate enough to hear just a snippet of a radio interview with the author and it prompted me to find out more about Alison Armstrong. I found ""Keys to the Kingdom"" and I was delighted by it. It's a fast, easy, and enjoyable read, but more importantly it clarified some of the most important and engaging differences between men and women. I couldn't believe she wasn't talking specifically about ME and MY journey through manhood. It made me realize how my ""natural"" tendencies could easily drive my wife crazy and result in her natural response that would, in turn, drive ME crazy. It's not about faults or failures, it's about acceptance, understanding, and reaching a level of compatibility that all relationships seek. I have two married children and one who has been ""frog-farming"" all her life. I won't wait for a special gift occasion, all three are getting their own copy of ""Keys to the Kingdom!"""
1,"Did not care for the ""story"" format -- boring","There are a few good ideas in this book, but an insipid storyline makes you have to fight boredom through most of the pages. I finally just started skimming through the book to pick out any relevant points. I suspect Armstrong used the story format because without the storyline -- the points made in the book would take about 20 pages to make."
4,earnest and heartwarming,"I got this book on CD for my sister, who is 16. I listened to it first to make sure it was okay for a teenage girl. It is. Keys to the Kingdom is written very earnestly, and it is so straightforward that the lessons about men (and a few about women) are clear as crystal. At one point in the book I thought she was talking about me! I think at the end of the book the plot interfered with the main message of the book, but overall it is an excellent listen.By the way, the author herself narrates the book, and her voice is perfect for narration. Her voice was how I was introduced to her: I heard her on the radio a few times before I became convinced that this would be a good book to read."
4,Great message covered with cheese,"I agree with other reviewers that although full of powerful information that can literally make you see the opposite sex in a different light, the message is diluted with a cheesy story line. I still recommend this book to any woman interested in deeper understanding of men in her life."
5,Yippie for Keys to the Kingdom!!!!,Alison Armstrong's Keys to the Kingdom is a blessing....I can't wait to read it again to find deeper value and hope for all my relationships with men.Thank you Alison for your hard work . Beautiful book.
4,Improve your relationships with men,The informaton is revealed in a very moving and compelling way. The characters seem to come alive. I have applied the advice in the book in my own relationships and have had amazing results. For anyone looking to improve their relationships with men this book is a must.
1,Better to take the seminar,I took the seminar and it was a gift. The book is so boring I couldn't get through the first two chapters. Don't let the book disuade you from signing up to take one of her seminars. Celebrating Men and Satisfying Women is one of the best weekends I've ever spent.
4,Good news is around the corner for us men,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. What I enjoyed most was knowing that this information is going out to 1,000s of women and is going to have a great and very positive impact on how women relate to men. Life just got a little easier. So much of what Alison writes about men is right on. I am 38 years old, so I also got a glimpse of what is on the horizon for me as a man going through his own development. Having this book read by women will make it easier for us men to love, appreciate and be heros to women. As a man, it taught me what women are going through as they 'try' to relate to us (men) and what is their current thought process that prevents it from happening effortlessly. This book gave me an insight into how I can now relate to women that will make things easier for me."
1,A must read for psych students.,"This book is required reading for my Abnormal Psychology class, and a must-read for all psych students.Told from the delusional perspective of the book's author, Gospel of Timothy is the story of the self-proclaimed ""King Messiah"" who claims to have seen God -- in the flesh!Tons of insight into many different aspect of abnormal psych, including borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, paranoia, conduct disorder (aggressive), dementia and serious psychosis. Also the topic of my term paper.Important to note that the review given by ""Lyn Johnson"" is actually the review of the author himself.A must read for all psych students and enthusiasts."
1,The Gospel of Timothy - Religion or Psychology?,"With degrees in both Religious Studies and Philosophy, and an advanced degree in Psychology, I thought I'd read it all, until I found ""The Gospel of Timothy."" I found this book to be fascinating; not in it's content (which is based upon a modern-day Messiah's experience of literally seeing God in the flesh), but in the psychology behind the author's experience.A must read for psychology buffs, professionals and hobbyists alike, ""The Gospel of Timothy"" presents eerie similarities to the development of such charasmatics as Jim Jones (The People's Temple) and Bo Peep (Heaven's Gate).Errors in grammar, syntax and spelling can be quite distracting within the text of ""The Gospel of Timothy"" (a professional editor would be recommended for any future editions), however, skimming for content may help in reducing the preoccupation with the egregiousness of the errors, and the appentence to edit in red pen."
1,How?,"How did this book get on to Amazon's shelves? Upon first reading you're not sure if he's serious...and it's kind of funny. Spend some time in ... chat rooms and talk with him. He's very strange; and then the book makes sense. He's serious, it's his gospel."
1,You have to be kidding.,"This guy must have been doin too much LSD and crack way back in the 70's. Go to his website and you will already know this guy is a psycho. This guy needs some serious help. I don't even know how this book ever made it on Amazon. The guy didn't even seem to use an editor, there are so many mistakes."
3,No new tales to tell,"First I want to mention, that I was a huge Alarm fan from the time they released 'Declaration' all the way to the underrated 'Raw' album. I was even a founding member of the first official European Alarm fan club. However, as much as I wanted to rant and rave about this new album, I actually got rather bored with the CD quickly. Someone mentioned, that this 'new Alarm' sounds nothing like the 'old' Alarm - but I completely disagree. Here are the same huge 'Rock' anthems that we heard on 'Strength' or 'Eye of the Hurricane'.... unfortunately though, the originals were better (in my opinion). I thought 45 RPM was a step forward, but the rest of the album just doesn't cut it for me. On many occasions, the album sounds like a bad U2 copy. The production is uninspired and the lyrics are rather dull. If you want to add another item to your 'Alarm' collection, then go ahead with this one, otherwise buy 'Declaration', 'Strength' or the remastered 'Electric Folklore Live' CD."
4,This is NOT an Alarm album,"Does it bother anyone that this isn't an Alarm album? It's essentially a Mike Peters solo record. Don't get me wrong - it sounds good but it's MP and 3 other dudes ... none of whom were ever in The Alarm.Therefore, it bugs me to hear how ""The Alarm are back."" or ""This is the first Alarm album in over a decade.""I'm afraid not. But it sounds good. = )"
1,Doesn't lock in,The inner sleeve doesn't lock in the outer part. I lost my iPAQ while walking down the stairs and now it needs an expensive repair of the display!!!!
3,should have been 5 stars,"absolutely great camera and sound work, performance segment should have been much longer; if it were, 5 stars for sure. The interviewer inserted himself far too much into this dvd, appearing on camera and asking (in a rather awkward manner) some tired, well worn questions himself---the Stephen Bennett dvd from the same company is much better---many more and longer tunes, and Bennett talks and answers questions at length from an unseen and unheard interviewer, without the distraction and interruptions of an on camera questioner."
1,Keep Looking,"This book is ok as a supplemental command reference but as a tutorial I would give it a D-. There are only a few exercises & the drawings were created in an earlier version and saved as 2000 format. Some don't act as expected. There are also some errors that were not caught (the book appears to have been updated from an earlier release). While a beginner could re-create the drawings shown in the command examples, it would take an unacceptable amount of time. Each explanation should come with a drawing that has been pre set up for the user to practice the commands & see how they work. Only the command line version of each command is given (right click menus are also somewhat explained), with no mention of how to use a toolbar or menu bar to activate the commands! The only reason to buy this book is because it's the only one out there."
1,Lacks a crucial element,"What a disappointment - this is a fairly decent book for Mechanical Desktop 5, but ALL instructions pertain to the command line prompt codes (not the toolbar).For those of you who don't know what I'm referring to: Autocad gives you two main ways to execute commands - by typing in 8 to 10 letter codes (the old way), or by clicking on the toolbar buttons (the more user-friendly way). In some cases, you have no choice and must use the code commands, however this book makes no mention of the toolbar buttons that relate to what they're doing. Unless you are 'old school' and plan on trying to memorize hundreds of command codes, forget about this book - its no help."
4,parametric moddeling,This book gives a great overview of all the commands to start with parametric moddeling with mechanical desktop 5. The overview of commands is great but there's a lack of different possibilyties to acces the different commands.
5,fun!!,We read this book to our preschoolers who just love it! But early elementary ages would also enjoy the humor!It is one of our mainstay stories!! Enjoyed by both the children and the adults!
2,expected more,"Nice collections of cases, great quality pics and good discussion about each disease. But it misses DDx and findings discussion (ok, dr. Yousem has it in a pdf file on his website, but this is not practical). I recommend the case review authors to give a look at Mayo Clinic GI Imaging and Dr. Chew's MSK Teaching Files which are better case books (ok, they're more expensive, but are also more useful)."
1,Head & neck case review,This is a garbage book. Do not waste your money or time. Who are authors audiences. It is a useless book for anyone.
1,"Good cases, poor explanations","Good variety and various complexity of cases. BUT, little or no description of findings and the comments section is not well organized with no/little differential diagnosis and sketchy explanation of the radiologically relevant information. Poorly written book compared to its counterpart Case Review Series: Brain Imaging. Would not recommend for boards review or CME."
1,Jilted IW really Messed this one up,"Bug Riddled. Almost evrey map has exploits. This combined with all the built in hacks that COD1 had and absolutely no Anti-Cheat (PB) makes this a hackers dream come true.Hackers use wall hacks, aimbots at will, and can shut anyones server down, also at will. And Infinity Ward does not care.Mass multiplayer Server strike pending , read about it at iwnation.com/forums. I didnt buy it at amazon, but I believe that thier customers interested in buying this junk should be informed of the truth.If I was Amazon, I'd pull it from the shelves to avoid the inevitable angry customers.Oh, and the single player is a joke. Too easy. Only gets one star for graphics...to bad they didnt attach that to a decent game."
1,CoD2 only xp,"The requirements posted at amazon site say 98/ME/2000/XP.That was great. I was ready to buy, but Activision states CoD2 not compatible with 95/98/ME.CoD is compatible but CoD2 is not compatible 98 or ME.I can't run this without 2000 or XP OS. My hardware is fine but now I have to make my system boot both XP and 98. NUTS"
1,Whats the point...?,"This is just the same old game that you beat in two hours and then throw away... if you are so rich that you can throw 50 bucks off the window for 120 minutes of staring at a computer screen, go ahead... I know it's a contradiction to spend time in front of a computer screen writing a review to complain about how much a waste of time this game is, but hopefully, a few minutes of my time can save you 50 bucks."
5,Call To Duty 2,This game was very good and well worth the purchase - I dont write long reviews and played it awhile ago so dont have much more to say
3,Call of Duty II just like one,"I think one was better, as in most followups. I finished (on the easiest) in around 10 hours or so. One was more challenging and different."
4,Call Of Duty 2 (Review),"I haven't played the game all the way through yet but so far it has been a lot of fun, the graphics are great, and the soud is pretty realistic too!"
4,Not quite as much fun as the first one but enjoyable,"I enjoyed playing this game, but it is quirky on my machine. I have 512MB of memory and it seems to not be enough for the game to load smootly. It had a tendancy to hang up at times when loading modules.My biggest complaint is there is no way to disable the 'windows' key. I often hit it diring heavy combat and hard to start over.A smaller complaint is the ending, it is quite abrupt and much less satisfying as the first game.On the positive side, the graphics are great and I am looking forward to Call of Duty 3."
3,Frustrating 1st Person,"The person who decided to make game saves automatic should be demoted to the mail room. This game is SO frustrating because of the lack of saves. Even in easy mode, you can get killed and you are right back to where you started 15 minutes ago. I have played the same stretch of ground 20 times and have finally given up. I applaude Activision for getting some realistic detail into COD2, but the there have been WAY too many times of frustration that has quenched the fun."
1,Doesn't install in Windows 7,"I have a new PC with Windows 7 64 bit on it. When I try to install this game, I get an error immediately and the install exited.I played this on my old Vista computer and it worked fine and was a fun game."
4,You can really feel like you are part of the action!,"What I really enjoy about this game is how realistic it is! There are a number of great missions that you go on that are based on historical events. Also, you really do feel a part of the actions. For instance, when a bomb explodes next to you, the ground shakes and your controller shakes as well! The game is also rather challenging. Often times it is hard to see who is shooting at you so you have to be very, very careful not too move too quickly or expose yourself to gun fire. One wrong move and you are dead!I would strongly recommend this game to any fan of shooters...or any fan of good games in general!"
4,Replaying same old game with new disk,"I purchased this copy to replace one that had become damaged over the years. Played it again, still a good game to pass the time. Wish there were more like these WW11 games."
1,A total failure,"I think I expected too much out of Call of Duty 2. I expected it to be playable. Sorry Activision but this game was a total flop. It is completely ridculous to have to have something more than a 256 MB nVidia 6800 and more than 2 GBs of Ram to play it a resolution greater than 1024x768. This game wasn't only a complete failure on the graphical front, but also on the fun front. It was a complete chore to play through the first few levels. What a waste of $50. Save it and buy something that is fun, like Call of Duty 1, Battlefield 2, or any of the other FPS games which are semi-decent."
1,50 bucks down the tube,"I recieved this game yesterday. Installed after luch, around 1 PM. By 6 PM I was watching the credits. The game was intense, I'll admit that, but I didn't pay 50 BUCKS for 6 hours of entertainments! I feel robbed! When my dad, who payed the game, came back home and asked me if I was enjoying it I had to tell him I was just starting!If you can install and finish the thing in 6 hours then it's not worth more than 10 BUCKS!!! I would have gone to the movies!! It would have costed me a penny conpared to this!!!50 bucks down the tube!!! I want my money back!!!"
1,do not buy call of duty 2,"It costs to much and its very bad. Its to much like the last one and the graphics are terrible. there is only about 5 knew guns and they are all very similar, so if I were you I would not buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,DirectX errors,"i have a high end system with a GeForce 6800 nVidia video card, and the game has many errors. At first I had to run the game with low video settings to avoid the ""Directx unrecoverable error"". Then, I had to run it in safe mode to avoid the error. The tech support had many things to try and were baffled at why the error is still occuring on my high end system. About half way through the game the error still came up even in safe mode!! The gameplay is predictable, but still fun at times. I'd wait til the price drops to about $20 to buy it..."
4,"Great game, a little short","That's basically all I have against this game. It's a tad bit short. I bought it and beat it in less than 5 hours. I was suprised when the credits started rolling (In that classic COD way). But i do play the missions over and over again, so pretty good replay value. Graphics are awesome and the music is well done. Gameplay is very intense. The only thing I really got sick of was hearing soldiers scream ""MG-42!"" and ""Potato Masher!."""
4,"Fun, but haven't I done all this before?","Let me start and say that this is a great sequel. It's a fantastic game with an engaging mix of graphics and gameplay. Aesthetically, it's one of the best FPS's in the genre at the moment; from the rich 5.1 sounds to the gritty feel of combat situations, COD2 has it down.Where it lets me down is just that it feels pretty tired. Sure, these are all new locations, but it's just... old. It's unfortunate to say that because it's really a great game, but I can't stop feeling like I've already done everything before."
4,this game is awesome!!!!!!!,"All you guys who said this game sucks is wrong. This game has awesome graphics, convincing explosions, and over 50 different guns. But I have to say that MW3 is way better."
5,Great WWII shooter,First to that poor kid who doesnt know what card to use. I would recommend an Ati radeon 9800pro or an nvidia geforce fx 5600. Make sure it has 128 mb of vram so u can pump up most of the graphicsAnyway to the game FUN AS IT CAN GET the AI is fantastic!!! Your guys get shot up the enemy gets shot up its soo fun!!! get it!!!
2,What a mess.,Have been a die hard COD'er since the original release. COD was the first PC game I played Multiplayer on and was hooked immediately. Have competed in CAL and TWL and used to play daily. IW messed up big time with this one. Single play is way to easy and I completed the game in a few hours. Multiplay maps are graphically much nicer but the new engine seems to have some flaws. Really feels like IW rushed this out with out much market testing. Easy to find glitches and the release of this game WITHOUT A ANTICHEAT are things that any testing would have brought to the forefront immediately. Would figure they would have learned from the first version. Recently there was a worldwide strike against the game due to the lack of response from the gamemakers. Just google search cod2 strike and you will get much of the information. Game is still fun but way to arcady. Unfortunate that such a highly anticipated game with a huge multiplayer base was taken so lightly by the developers.
3,Fun but...,"...but this should be an expansion pack for COD 1, and not a COD version 2, the fun is there and nice levels but nothing improved apart from graphics and some AI more, nothing in this COD2 justify the ""2"". I got more fun and brain working on COD1. At least you can have the multiplayer to get some ""original"" fun, nothing more justify buying this title."
1,A precursor for the later albums,This album mixes the old Debbie with the new Deborah. The tracks are great especially Tear Down These Walls and Goodbye.Its worth owning !
3,Some good advice but not polished,"Marion Winik writes personal essays that are funny and meaningful and I was really looking forward to hearing what she had to say on writing. She does have some good advice but this is a live recording of a writer's workshop and she has only a loose outline of what she wants to say. If you can stand the 6,056 times she says ""you know"" and ""or something,"" and if it doesn't bother you that she laughs at her own essays as she reads them, then this is for you. I was disappointed that her class wasn't better thought out and very irritated that her often wonderful essays were read so badly by her. (I just can't stand the nose laugh she does every few sentences.) I also lost sympathy with her the more she spoke about her rather indulged upbringing that included drug addiction. If you can get this for less than full price it might be worth a listen."
5,Encouraging and insightful - wisdom from master storyteller,"If you write personal essays, this is a fantastic book. Marion Winik tells it like no one else - and here she is in a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, giving us simple yet encouraging advice. I came away from this inspired and -- in spite of the other reviewer's challenges -- felt better knowing that this admirable writer is human like the rest of us (not always a performer). I'd recommend this to any writer, but if you love Marion Winik's writing, you can't go wrong here."
2,Just Wasn't There,"I was excited to get this book, for erotica books it had alot of good reviews. Well I was very dissapointed. The book was very short, and didn't explore the characters enough. I wanted to know more about their background. The characters were weak and there was just too many coincidences. Also I thought the thing with her grandfather was just too corny, especially at the end."
5,"Vampire Fantasy....hot , hot , hot,","Summary: Rana finds the man of her dreams but he is a vampire, and a hot one at that..Rana enjoys sex with Lucian but won't let him take her blood.Lucian is next in line to be head leader of the vampires, only he has to do it with his mate by his side..He found her only she can't commit. While these two are having hot and steamy relations there is a rogue vampire named Kraid who is out to kill Rana so Lucian can't complete the role of leader.WHAT A FUN READ...LOTS OF ACTION...LOTS OF SEX......GO LUCIAN !!!!!!CAN'T WAIT TO READ BOOK 2 A TASTE FOR REVENGE....."
2,Very limited,"This system is EXTREMELY limited in terms of flexibility andconfigurations. I spent some hours reading all documentation and afterall configurations I made, I still feel very disatisfied. It's realyextremelly limited.Its SIP connection/configuration (use of parameters) is not the standard,so IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY PROVIDER. Routing options are also a veryweak feature.Two stars is THE MAXIMUM SCORE POSSIBLE TO THIS SYSTEM.I've been working with mixed phone systems(voip + traditional) for 4 ys. This system is theworst I ever tried."
1,A misconceived compilation,"Maybe putting Peter Gabriel's first two solo albums together on one disk wasn't such a terrible idea--but why scramble the songs together, with alternating tracks from alternating albums? Those records had quite different sounds, themes, even production values--it's almost like intercutting songs from Diamond Dogs with songs from Young Americans.Either of the first two albums is worth buying on its own--together, they are not the bargain they seem to be. This is one album that should go out of print."
3,good,"This is a compilation of his first two solo albums, his third album (melted face) is not covered here. If you've only heard his popular songs on the radio you should be prepared to spend some time listening to this album, as it is more challenging, though not necessarily better. I think this collection of early tracks is more for hardcore Gabriel fans, and since those fans would already own his first two albums they probably would not want this bastardized collection. If your a casual fan just looking for a greatest hits collection you may want to stick with Tree, but i recommend Revisited if you are more adventurous."
2,What's the point?,"There is no real point in getting this compilation. This is basically a set containing material from Peters first two albums with songs that alternate between the first and second LPs.Go get the WWWAAAYYYY superior shaking the tree album for a great sample of his works.For a far better investment, look forward to his entire CD catalog being rereleased remastered. You can get the remastered editions of his first two albums.I agree with the reviewer below, this is one compilation that should go out of print.This album is completely unnecessary, even for die-hard PG fans."
2,The Real World,"Do any of you people know what Peter Gabriel is about? Do you hear music or feel it? If you are like me and you feel it, then yo don't need a review of ""Revisited"", because you have these tracks already on the individual albums. But, if you don't and you want to hear something different then check out ""THE RHYTHM OF THE HEAT"" We out!"
5,great album,"I honestly don't know why more people didn't rate this higher. If you are a fan of Peter Gabriel, then you will love this album. I have most of his albums and this is one of the best."
5,no more stomach problems,I found that I was getting acid indigestion from Glucosamine. This was the only tablet form of Glucosamine that does not give me indigestion.
4,good product,I have been experiencing some pain in my elbow and left knee and after 2 months of treatment with this product finally I felt some relief. Another important fact: it is totally safe for your stomach.
2,Beginner's Romanian,"I found this book to be moderately helpful regarding customs and history of country and culture. From the perspective of learning the language it was virtually worthless. Many conversations are listed, but without direct pronunciation guidelines, so the reader doesn't actually know if they are pronouncing it correctly. It might be okay for reading the language - not speaking it. Additionally the text is printed in approximately 7 point pica and is tiny and difficult to read. I'd advise a ""pass"" on this one."
2,Missionary to Romania,This book contains some helpful insights regarding customs and etiquet of the country but is not very useful in teaching the language skilss needed to communicate the type of phrases one might like to know when visiting this country.
2,it's not worth your money,"This book has a few good facts about the culture, but as to helping you learn the language, forget about it. It doesn't show you how to pronounce the words using English sounds. It just has the alphabet, then pages of scripts that you are just supposed to know from the alphabet. It is very bad for learning the language."
2,"ordered BLUE, light up blue/pink/purple!!!","the light appears to have a blue coating on the glass, but when lit, they shine a bluish-pruple-pink...not what I thought it would be."
4,Speedy Mountainbike tire!,"A fast street and hardpack road tire. Grips in corners well. Great for fittness riders, serious off roaders need not apply."
3,"Great all around tire, but sucks at certain tasks","These tires came stock on my new bike and since WTB is a known company in the MTB world I didn't think much of asking for more aggressive tires. My mistake.These tires are good for on the hard pack trails, but struggle to maintain grip on more technical sections of the trails such as rock gardens and areas with roots. I would would recommend going with a more aggressive tire like the velociraptor ."
2,Not as advertised...,"Well, after reading the reviews, the actual performance of these tires has deffinately left me wanting. I have put a number of rides on these tires (they came on my new 29er) and I can't wait to change them. I have experienced a flat almost every ride; even with heavy duty tubes. The traction provided by the little tiny numbs is all but nonexistant. These tires may, and probably do, perform well on hard pack, but in the NE we almost never get that. The type of riding we typiv=cally do is technical with lost of roots, rocks and mud; these tires just can't cut it. As far as puncture protection - forget it. I have pull three large thorns from the tire that penetrated all the way through the casing. These tire are probably best suited for the rails-to-trails paths!"
1,dont get this,"this is the worst piece ok crap i have ever bought for my xbox. I dont even know where to start. The glue job on the lights was so messy, it was all over the tunnnel. It wouldnt fit over the CPU heatsink without bending 2 of the lights. It caused my whole motherboard in my xbox to fry and caused me to have the red ring of death. Whatever you do, dont buy this part for your xbox because you will regret it. Sure in the picture it looks cool but it is a poorly made part that causes trouble."
2,Not worth it,Just buy a clear windtunnel and the whisper fans because with the fans you can't tell that the LEDs are really working because of the fan LEDs and would save you some money
3,"Ok, I guess",Won't fit over the heatsink on my falcon without snapping off one of the LEDs(which are glued on).
1,Waste Of Money...Returned,"We purchased this globe from Amazon.com and couldn't wait to add it to our living room. It arrived in a box that looked like it's been through a war, however the globe was not physically damaged. When we unpacked it and looked closely at the quality of the globe we were appalled at lack of attention to detail this product offered. The latitude lines did not meet and the tropic of cancer/capricorn were off as well.Spending almost $400.00 for something that belongs in a kindergarten class is not an option.Looking into another manufacturer to satisfy our needs. Waste of money!!! Returned it immediately."
5,30 Years of service reward,"I've always wanted a globe and was thrilled to find this item amongst those available to me as a 30th anniversary gift from my employer. When I placed my order, it was backordered due to ""popular demand"", but I received it without delay and on my anniversary day. I LOVE IT! Having selected it as my service award makes it even more of a treasured possession. Yes, I would highly recommend this product."
3,Oxo Can't Do Everything Well,"I like Oxo products because they stand for a certain level of design and quality. This timer looks like it belongs in a modern kitchen and has a hefty, quality feel to it (granted it's probably just extra steel that adds weight). However, when I set it for the first time, it didn't tick. That was a 10 min setting, so I thought it might be one of those where you have to turn it past 15 mins and come back to 10 mins. Nope. Bottom line is it ticks by itself half the time, and requires a gentle coaxing the rest of the time. I find the ring is also a little soft."
1,sent it back...,I got the timer and yes it's heavy. that's about all the good I can say about it.some of the numbers were scratched. you have to turn it all the way clockwise to 0 and back again to get it set. we tried it a few times and the timer wouldn't go off at all. then it finally did and wouldn't quit ringing. I had a Lux for years before this one and it was very dependable until I dropped it on the floor. I sent this one back and ordered another Lux timer.
1,Terrible--Does Not Work,"I'm looking for a timer. Simple as can be. I should have listened to the previous reviews. This thing simply did not work right out of the box. It would ""catch"" at the 20 minute mark and just get stuck there. Great.I would definitely not recommend this product."
2,Acrylic Secrets with Ginger Cook - Apple Blossom Creek,"I was really hoping for more considering the price. The dvd goes too quick, is not very informative at all and only goes through how to paint one scene. The fact is that it is mostly a promotional film as it shows students of this particular artist holding up their work which is the same picture painted ovr and over again."
1,terrible quality,"I buy this for my mother for chrsitmas because she has recently started to become interested in painting. We put this into our relatively new theater system and attempt to watch video. this look like someone has taken cheap camcorder put on tripod and with this terrible sound quality created a movie. You can barely see what she is painting and can barely hear what she is saying unless you turn the sound way way up. At which point the scene transitions are SO LOUD that it shake the window. I rteturn this DVD and I am not happy with this at all. My mother did not even want to watch this because it was neraly impossible to listen to and bad to see. Between straining to hear and plugging ears fromt he terrible transitions to the poor quality of the video, i would rate this a 1 out of 10. I feel bad for this but it was not worth $5, not to mention $30. Sorry :("
4,"Good product, slightly different than Original","As what usually happens with replacements, this was not identical to the one coming off a 1995 Towncar. The vacuum port is clocked differently. The 'molded' vacuum line was still able to reach and connect but since it is 17 years old and hardened I'm hoping it will stay there and not break. Also,it does not come with a gasket (boo!). But since my old one stayed perfectly on the manifold I just mounted the new valve and had no problems. I still feel better about using this Motorcraft one than taking chances with the more ""universal"" generic replacements."
5,Superb Album!!!,The music is played very well. with beautifull organ drones from Karen Mantler and excellent bass-lines from mr. Steve Swallow.
5,Hemp & Cotton Throw,This throw blanket is compact and works great over a fluffy throw that may be soft but not particularly warm. The thermal qualities make all the difference and is easy to transport.
5,High Times Hemp & Cotton Throw Blanket,"I purchased this as a gift, the receiver was very pleased. I was very satisfied with the speedy shipping. When I ordered, I was quite sure it would not arrive before the holiday, but it did."
1,Not Willing to Pay for Parts,"Bring out complete seasons of this series and you will get my money, but I will not be nickel and dimed to death just to own something that you want to spoon feed to the public so you can make more money. NOT RECOMMENDED until entire season sets are available."
3,"We love this series, but...","two problems:1 - you can't get all of season 2 on one disc yet, so each volume only has 6 episodes, and only 2 volumes available (as of 12/12)2 - Season 2, IMHO, is not as good as 1. We miss the adventures in the search for the Makluan (sp?) rings. This season has a completely different feel. It's not that it's bad, it's just missing a particular element of fun that we were enjoying in Season 1.Also, our kids are on the younger side (K/1st grade) and Season 2 is ""older,"" more scary stuff, more intense action, situations they don't really get, etc. The bad guy action is much more pronounced. We severely limit their watch time of this."
2,Netflix It,I just rewatched the first season on netflix. Just rent on netflix type of service till they supply a completed season box set for a reasonable price. I didn't realize there was a second season produced. But I really enjoyed the series so far. The fullscreen option is dated and unnecessary for something originally produced in widescreen.
1,Really awful.,"We bought this specifically to add body to homemade yogurt. We'd seen only good comments about it. Using less than half a cup of Nido to 42 oz of fresh whole milk resulted in the worst tasting yogurt we'd ever made. We couldn't believe it was the Nido, so tried again, this time with a scant 1/3 cup. Still horrid. Went back to the store brand, not great but certainly edible, until we were able to pick up some Saco, which worked well. I'm not sure whether the Nido was rancid or just didn't fit our taste. It *shouldn't* have been rancid, being in a sealed can just purchased, and not beyond expiration..."
4,Makes 13 Quarts of WHOLE Milk,"Instant Dry Whole Milk. According to the label, this 3.52 lb can makes about 13 quarts. Rather expensive per quart, compared to fresh milk from the grocery store, but cheaper than a trip to the store when I run out of milk and need some quickly. Ingredients: Whole Milk, Soy Lecithin, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3 (per label). Imported from Chile. Instructions say to add 3 heaping tablespoons of NIDO to 1 cup of WARM water -- I guess you can chill it after it's mixed.Haven't tried it yet, so can't comment on flavor."
1,Was excited to order powdered milk for the first time...,"So I was so incredibly excited for this powdered milk to arrive. I looked at the reviews for this product and they were generally positive. I saw one dissenting review from a person who said they switched the manufacturing plant from Chile to Mexico and it was horrible now. I thought he was wrong and was just some bitter man with time on his hands.Boy I was wrong.I never tried this product when it was made in Chile, but I can tell you that it now tastes horrible and nothing like regular milk. It tastes like cheese, really old rotting cheese. It smells terrible, and all my buddies who I had try it agree with me. I have a friend who picked up powdered milk from Albertsons and his is substantially better. It's a store brand I believe, but I can't order that on Amazon.I want to request my money back from Nestle. This is probably the worst product I ever ordered during my time here at Amazon and on prime."
5,Nice Quality,"I have never been satisfied with the quality of non-fat dry milk products over the years. However, this whole milk version is excellent when prepared as directed. Actually I used a little less in my cup to simulate a ""low fat"" version. I am using this as my main milk source when up at the cabin and am adding it to my emergency provisions.This would be a great addition to emergency food supplies, or for those that either can't get to the store for fresh milk or don't want to pay the high prices. I can highly recommend this product.LB"
4,Easy way to make milk,I found the taste of Nido to be like store bought milk. The convenience of not having to carry home the containers every time is a plus for me. It would have been nice for a measuring spoon to be included so one could get a more accurate mixture of Nido and water. It is still an easy drink to make and it is tasty.
3,WOW!,"I was about to make another purchase on this milk. I was going to do the monthly shipment. I'll never buy this again when it's cheaper elsewhere....It's a fantastic product, but too bad the price doubled like that..I just paid 13 for this....What happened??"
5,Want taste as close to Whole Milk as possible?,"We lived in the Middle East for several years, while my children were toddlers/milkdrinkers. Our milk choices were canned, reconstituted, dry nonfat, and several with indecipherable labels. Then we tried Nido (Europe). I had to experiment a little but finally came up with the best-tasting method. Mix it up in the blender - I think aerating it helps it taste fresher. Next, refrigerate it overnight before use. It becomes delicious! The family liked drinking milk again, and my tea stopped tasting strange."
4,Real whole milk,"In an emergency situation, skim milk is not nearly as attractive as full fat milk. For my food storage pantry, I choose Nido whole milk powder. The large containers keep a very long time in storage, and they are light enough to travel well. May I suggest you combine this milk powder with a meal replacement, like Carnation Instant Breakfast, for a more nutritionally complete source of calories. Both items are dehydrated, so they are light and will travel well, and keep for long periods of time on the shelf."
4,A must for any Collective Soul fan!!!,"I recently acquired this CD and man was it worth the wait. This is a very good addition to any Collective Soul fan's collection. The album is a little more ""pop""py but it still shows Ed's amazing vocals and ability to write songs. It would be interesting to see Collective Soul redo some of the songs and put them on a future album. The standout songs are ""Window"", ""Shelter"", and ""Lost and Found""."
4,A Collection of Hits,"Ed-E Roland is the raw product of something that is to become the greatest step in the musical industry. The songs on the album do resemble the writing styles of traditional Collective Soul works, but it is most apparent that Ed Roland needs the entire crew to truly produce the sound that thousands have come to know and love as Collective Soul. A band with a voracious appetite for meaning in their songs. Ed-E Roland will be an excellent addition to any Collective Soul Enthusiast; although, I do not believe it would be of any interest to someone not yet touched by the beauty that is Collective Soul."
3,Before there was Collective Soul...,"It was interesting to listen to Ed Roland's first CD. This was released (I believe) 2 years before the first Collective Soul CD, ""Hints, Allegations & Things Left Unsaid"". Even with (I assume) a low production budget for this disk, and with some of the background vocals sounding very dated, the amazing songwriting talent of Ed Roland shows through. In fact, one of the songs on this CD appears on a later Collective Soul disk, ""Over Tokyo"" is the song and it is also on ""Blender"" which was released in 2000, if I remember correctly.Basically, if you're a serious Collective Soul fan, or are looking for talented songwriting, this disk is worth purchasing. I'm a huge fan of Roland and Collective Soul, and will proudly display this disk along with the band's CDs."
3,Ed-E Roland,MMMmm bit of a let down not as polished as Collective Soul I can't say I play it all that much
1,"Useless. Repeat, useless.","If you are using a computer with a recent version of windows 95, or windows 98, the code in this book won't work, so don't buy it. Frankly, the publishers should have pulled it off the shelves by now."
5,Best record ever,"I have this on vinyl and CD. In the late 1970s, you went to a high school dance, you would hear most of these songs, for they are dance worthy and lovely and thrilling, when boys and girls danced in each other's arms. I have all of Boz's early stuff on CD now, and found a few songs he wrote & sung on Steve Miller's records. They don't make music like this anymore, I am sad to say, but I keep listening to the old stuff while checking out the new crap, which I have some of. Ya outta have this!"
5,Dorm room desk lamp,"Ordered this lamp from Amazon for my daughter for her dorm room. She pretty much likes it and the fact that it has that organizer for pens, pencils, paper clips,etc attached at the base. Pretty practical."
1,Don't buy this book on Russian gestures,"This book is not worth your time or money at any price. It contains few useful gestures one could imagine using. It contains mostly vulgar, crude, and obvious gestures requiring no explanation and features sexual and drinking-related gestures anyone could figure out without assistance. The influences of the 70s and the former Soviet Union served it ill. It is crude and not useful."
1,deceivingly educational!!!!,"Yes, it's cute and yes it lights up, but it's teaching the wrong things. I AM a teacher and the phonics section of the toy is totally wrong! Many of the consonants are mispronounced, adding the ""uh"" sound to the end. Also, when my son doesn't ""perform"" to acceptable levels, it boo's him and puts a big X on the screen. I'd much rather hear ""try again"" a thousand times than that. LeapPad products have accurate phonics and positive reinforecement."
4,Very good Learning toy,This one 2 year old son got as a gift.He really like it a lot than any other interactive toys he has played.It is more friendly and interactive. It has 7 different activites including a 'clock quiz' to learn time.Very good battery life.
3,Waste of Money,"My aunt bought this toy for her daughter it was so nice i decided to purchase one for my son. the one my aunt bought stopped working after a while (1 1/2 yrs) and the one I bought for my son did the same thing in a little over a year it jus stopped working. I thought it needed new batteries tried changing them, did not make a difference I jus have it there watching me because it is in such a good condition it would be ashame to throw it away. They should try selling this toy for 10.00 because thats what it's worth for something which just gives up after a while. what are the olds of 2 of the same toys lasting around the same time frame."
1,No one caught this glaring error?????,"This toy seems like lots of fun until you realize they're mispronouncing the word Library. They say it 'Libery'. Honestly, it seems that someone along the line in developing this toy would have caught this. Our[...]now discusses in length the CORRECT way to say the word and how his TOY says it. And they state that this toy teaches phonics and vocabulary? Not in the English language!"
4,Luck does come in Streaks,"Though a chronic gambler, I am a newcomer to backgammon games. I found this book intructive and pleasant to read. Unlike another reviewer here, I thought the advice was sound, even the one warning of ""streaks of bad luck"". Anyone playing games of chance is painfully aware of that.I especially enjoyed the section on Probability Theory and how it bears on the games."
5,"If your looking for meaning, find it here!","This peek into the lives of two remarkable figures. For anyone who enjoys Shmuelly and Uri, this book is a must. It adresses some core issues within the heart and soul of each and every one of us."
4,The Reign Continues!!!!,"The 6th Album from the Mayimbe really hits the notes with cuts like ""Consejo de Padre"", ""Durmiendo Solo"" & ""Porque tanto Problema"" which really reflects normal everyday life situations. The balada version of ""Durmiendo Solo"" is the sleeper hit of this album because the lyrics truly hit the heart of a lonely man. However, the album gets 4 stars because the merengues have taken such a change with the guira doing double time like Busta Rhymes' lyrics, which is not bad but it's not smooth either. Overall, this guy is really international with this effort."
4,sabor latino,"antony santos is the best bachatero there is in the dominican republic. He knows the gitar better than any bachateros. sabor latino is one of the best, but there are more to come. I heard that the CD for this december is going to be the best."
4,A Fund Selection of Recordings,"These tracks were clearly chosen by someone who loves this music. The repertoire is familiar, but the recordings are mostly ones I have not heard before. It's Judy Garland on ""Over the Rainbow,"" but an older Judy, not the track from the movie. And Dean Martin singing ""On the Street Where You Live?!"" Much more fun to hear than I would ever have imagined. If you want a fresh look at some of your favorite tunes, I can recommend this collection."
5,ESTA ANTIGUA CIENCIA ORIENTAL,"NI SIQUIERA TE FATIGA.-.. Es como lo dice su título: Como un ballet suave, de movimientos pausados durante el cual tu corazon tiene la oportunidad de encontrar paz-... Puedes hacerlo en tu cuarto, en tu jardin, en un parque...Una vez que los practicas, ES COMO UNA DROGA! TE HACE SENTIR TAN BIEN, QUE YA NO LO ABANDONAS..."
3,Heat,"The book is quite interesting to read. People who are into water sports would enjoy this the most. A short summery: A sixteen year-old Bonnie Chamberlain wants to be a proffesional diver. On one of her practices she has an accident injuring her scalp. Fortunetly she is is alright and is still determined to practice, practice and practice. Now it's even harder for her to concentrate on the dives that her farther's in trouble with the law, and it ends with... well,I won't tell you, if u wanna find out,read the book!"
1,What a rip off!!!,"I purchased this book as a gift for my wife, an avid Elizabeth Peters fan. This book was advertised as a new release. This, I am sure, was a planned (and carefully crafted) misrepresentation! This book actually is a re-release of an older Elizabeth Peters book--being released by her new publisher. I totally fell for this because I don't read Ms. Peters books, I just like to buy gifts that I know my wife will enjoy. Ultimately, we now own two separate versions of this book, both technically ""new releases"". Buyers Beware!!!"
3,Get rid of Ramses,"I am having a problem getting past the third chapter. I enjoyed her first two mysteries when she met her husband-to-be and then the birth of her son Ramses. Now I am getting a bit tired of the bratty son and the recurrent Master Criminal. How about a new plot? I don't know why Peters has made the son such an obnoxious character. Then there is the adolescent relationship between Peabody and Emerson. Who cares, just get to the mystery. Unfortunately, I have purchased three more of her books and will probably skim through them trying to find the mystery."
2,The one that stopped the series.,"I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but the characters have become charicatures of themselves, not developing at all. If I had a child like Rames I would slit my wrists, or his. There is no need to add to the ever present stupid female protagonist profile. Sorry Elizabeth, you took a potientially promising woman and made her ridiculous. Did not finish this book and will not go on with the series."
1,Not what I thought I ordered,"I thought this was a new release too, since it had a date of 2008 as release date. Now after reading Avid Reader's review, I see what happened, I guess it was the Mummy Case re-released. I am very dissapointed that this wasn't mentioned, because I thought I was getting a new book, but turns out to be an old one. Needs to be mentioned somewhere so fans don't think they're getting one thing, but really getting an old book."
3,Lion in the Valley,I love the Peabody and Emerson stories but sure do wish the dialogue assigned to Ramses were not so voracious.
4,The Master Criminal Plots the Series,"Amanda gets to meet the Master Criminal in the LION IN THE VALLEY and that scene alone is worth the price of the book. Elizabeth Peters is a master at humor in tense situations and she doesn't fail her readers in what is otherwise a shallow mystery.Ramses has reached seven years of age. He is now reading everything and writing his own Egyptian dictionary while making friends and causing his parents hair to turn grey with his antics. He may prove a better detective than his mother.A good summer read that is easy to postpone until your next trip to the beach.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,clever and very entertaining,I found this book to be very engrossing from the very first page! The author pulls no punches in stating his opinion and exposing the 'dirty little secrets' of some of the largest wime producers in California...a must read for anyone who enjoys wine or is interested in the wine business!
1,How dare you air the industry's dirty laundry in public!,"Perdue has seen fit for a decade now to talk about all manner of facts and situations that have no business being discussed in public. before he came along, the industry did just fine taking care of its own problems in private.I can't quibble with his research and his facts, but his insane desire to let the whole world know about the political infighting and other private controversies are too much! I can see no valid purpose other than sensantional personal aggrandizment for writing in such details about things that are the industry's own and nobody else's business.I've been in this industry for more than two decades now and can't see any reason to reveal all this. Don't buy this book. It will just hurt the industry."
5,THIS WILL BE SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!,"Evryone else says that the animorphs find the time matrix, or the ellimist comes back, but I think they find some other way to go!"
5,THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a really good book. You should read it. All I will tell you is that the Animorphs go back in time by a nuclear explosion. Bye!! I f you want to know, I have every single Animorph book there is."
5,THIS BOOK WAS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you liked Megamorphs #1, then you'll love Megamorphs #2 even more. This book was the best yet!"
5,Fascinating!,"I loved this book! The Nesk,Mercora, and even the Deinonychus and Tyrannosaurus Rex! I could't put it down! I read it on the bus, in bed at night and even a little in CLASS!!! I SAID I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN if you didn't hear me- uh, well you know what I mean: I LOVED THIS LOVABLE,CUDDLEABLE FUZZY,WUZZY,DINOZZY BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Best!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this book, in one week I read this one ten times! Im not going to say anything about it. Read the books! <Together we fight>"
5,Time Matrix,In the time of the dinosaurs?! That means they find the Time Matrix in the abandoned construction site. That means they can eliminate the Yeerks!
2,Not up to Animorphs standard,"This book had a completly unoriginal plot. A nuclear explosion, the meteor that killed the dinosaurs, blah blah blah. Do NOT buy this book."
3,What were you thinking Applegate??,"Sorry, but this book is definately only three stars. It all starts out when Marco hears about a sunk sub and the Animmorphs go to investigate. Something goes wrong and suddenly they find themselves in preostoric times!I don't like this book because: a)It has the whole Sario Rip thing that was already put in another book. b)When they find themselves stuck in the Creostastes(sorry, don't know how to spell it) Period, there's another alien speices. I don't like that whole thing, along with The Mutation #36, and c)How it ended was very, very predictable. I don't know about you, but I knew that the comet was going to blow them back to their own time sooner or later.Sorry Applegate, but you couldn't give us another winner like THe Andalite Chronicles (I have a review there, too)"
5,Expose of Great Britain's deportation of children in foster care,"Emily Watson is amazing as social worker Margaret Humphreys, the woman who exposes how Great Britain, primarily in the 1950s and into the late 1960s, deported over 150,000 young children to Australia, Canada and other countries. The movie focuses on the children, now adults raised in Australia orphanages, who are searching for their family members in England. Save time and buy the book, originally titled Empty Cradles, because you will want the rest of the story after viewing this movie.Oranges & Sunshine"
5,No odors anymore!!,"This product is wonderful!!We had a futon mattress that had a very strong mildewy odor. Placing it in the sun wasn't enough. One spray of this and the odor was gone. We also used it to remove cigarette smoke from a car interior - ceiling, carpet, seats - from many years of smoking. This took two sprayings, but it's gone and gone for good!!"
4,Very useful and simple to build,I use this device to test the diodes and transistors I pull off circuit boards to reuse. It was also a fun and simpler kit to build.
3,Its a kit.,Nothing to get excited about. It was fun to put together.The directions where very easy to follow. The circuit boardwas very easy to read.
5,Beautiful!,"I had been looking for a large tablecloth for special occasions as my old ones have definitely seen better days. I bought this one in a gold shade that's really beautiful -- even nicer in person than on line. It will look great set with my white china and can be used year-round, not just for Christmas and New Year's. It's cotton/poly which means it will come out of the dryer nicely. I'm really looking forward to using it."
3,lenox platiunum tablecloth,I returned this item.. The color was not as expected although the fabric and design were very nice. I purchased another one in a deep red and I am very pleased with that one.
4,Lennox tablecloth,This is a great buy and I really like the color. It's give color to my dining room without having to have a hot red. I'm really enjoying it.
2,nice but,I purchased the 70 by 86 oval table cloth and it is very nice except that it is 67 x 79 and did not fit my table properly.
4,Lovely Tablecloth,"The 70 x 86 oval tablecloth size is very difficult to find, so I snapped this up. I washed it before putting it on the table and although it did shrink a little, it looks great. If taken out of the dryer right away, it should need little or no ironing. Fabric quality appears to be good."
5,down with change,"to any true hip hop head this cd is a must! The lyrical skills of jaymanila and cool calm pete are out of control, and the production by Dj Pre, MF Doom, and rjd2 just ad to the greatness of the cd. The cd offers mellow beats to chill to and some heavy hitters that are sure to make your heart race. All of the tracks are incredible. BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!ALSO LOOK OUT FOR GRAND BUFFET"
5,This book is WAY COOL.,This book is sooo great I could not put it down .It is so real I forgot that it was not just a story the promlems are sort of like the real life and the things we all have to deal with .Even though I know Dawn is trying to help but could she at least try to be a little understanding after all Sunny mum is DYING like hello Sunny is having major prolems here.
1,bad,"i did not like this book because ""Sunny"" does not write in sentences. you have to guess what is going on. also, it is boring"
3,Not bad.,"I just finished reading this book last night and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I don't like the Babysitters Club series. In fact, I just tried to read one of the Friends Forever and couldn't finish it. However, I finished this book in one day and can honestly say I enjoyed it. But don't tell anybody."
4,PRETTY GOOD,This book was a bit boring but got better and better as i read along. I really liked it!!
3,It got the job done,"I bought this tool to drill holes to mount a small safe to the floor where a normal drill wouldn't give me the angle I needed. It did get the job done, but I don't have a lot of confidence that it would last if I used it for any heavy duty work. The gears must either be distorted or not well mated together with each other because the chuck side of this item wobbles when you use it. It also made a rather unpleasant noise when I was using it. If you're buying this for light duty, it should get the job done. Just know that it is a cheaply made tool that likely won't hold up if you use it regularly."
2,Superficial,"The description says ""Virtually every piece composed by Brahms and not sacrificed to his uncompromising critical standards is discussed in this compendium, lucidly, readably, in biographical and cultural context, and in fine detail."" The claim ""in fine detail"" is blatantly untrue. The detail is about what you'd get on a typical CD insert booklet, nothing more. The C minor symphony gets a scant five pages; the E minor, just three; the four concertos get a total of 13 pages."
4,Good DVD,I enjoy this TV series though sometimes I wish they would leave out all the talk of Indian spirits and how much of a roll they tend to play in the whole show. Dr. Quin is of the Christian faith and yet it's like they want to make her take on the Indians belief system. Good family show if it weren't for that part.
3,No captions; no subtitles,There is no close-captioning and no subtitles. Not for the deaf or hard-of-hearing. We would have paid more to have that feature.
1,Dr Quinn season2,So far this has been a waste of money I ordered a month ago and still no box of dvd's. I ordered from three different vendors at the same tim and they were all delivered within 2 weeks except for this...
1,"Carl Sagan Good, A&E bad",It was nice to see a biography on Carl Sagan. We asked A&E to replay it but they would not so we had to buy it. The biography was ok. We only bought it because it has Carl Sagan in it. I would never buy anything with A&E on on it as they are so arrogant. It is too bad A&E will show things right after death or more sensational biographies.
4,Not totally accurate,"Just like in ""the Longest Day"" in which the 2nd Ranger is erroneously depicted as failing in their mission, Ryan depicts operation Market/Garden as a total failure since they failed to secure the final bridge. As with ""The Longest Day"", had Ryan fully reserched this subject, Ryan would have discovered that a major objective of the offensive was to open desperately needed port to shorten the allies' line of supply. As a result of this offensive, the allies attacked northward from their positions which were as far east as Nimigen and opened the port of Antwerp in Belgium. This was an important onjective to the overall European war effort."
1,Kindle Priced Higher than Paperback,"I never have and never will buy a book that is priced higher on the Kindle than the paperback. I will also never buy a book from a publisher who has this policy. I read well over a hundred books per year and even though this limits my choices somewhat, there are many books and many publishers to choos from."
5,Great introduction to Operation Market-Garden,"Great introduction to Operation Market-Garden. Good overview, with lots of anecdotes from participants. Included maps are appropriate/good. I quite enjoyed the writing style. This is a top recommendation for anyone interested in the setting."
5,Best Ryan Book,"Ryan's book is a great view of the failed Market-Garden Operation. He especially captures the plight, and bravery, of the doomed British 1st A/B. I would definitely recommend it to any WWII reader."
5,a must read book,"This book is awesome I definitely recomend it to people. This book is very interasting the way one of the greatest armes flow over to Germany, as one of the biggest aircraft units bombing Germany.Tremendous a towering monument to the courage of man and his ability to respond to overwhelming crisis and challenage. I say hell yeah, diffenetly get this book."
5,Amazing story from the ground up,"Beautifully written account of the battle for Arnhem and the famous bridge. Told from many perspectives, the British, the Germans, Americans, Poles, Canadians and Dutch civilians. Sometimes critical, sometimes overly heroic - it still is a monument to all those who died to liberate Europe and my homecountry the Netherlands, as well as those who survived and told Cornelius Ryan their story. Inmediately bought Ryan's other two works on the WOII-battles as well."
5,Brilliant and moving,"Cornelius Ryan presents the story of Operation Market-Garden with a scholar's attention to detail and a novelist's attention to human drama. Following D-Day, General Montgomery undertook a daring push to enter Germany and force its surrender. Paratroopers were dropped in advance to secure important bridges and hold them until ground forces arrived. Unfortunately, German resistance was far greater than anticipated and the route itself was often too narrow or inadequate in other ways, making the passage of a large armored force impractical. The result was a debacle and a great waste of human life.Monuments and memorials are important symbols of our gratitude to the men and women who have sacrificed so much on our behalf. However, I think books like this are even more valuable. They bring us as close to standing by their sides as is possible for one who wasn't there and deepens our understanding of their gift to us."
4,Classic of the Genre,"One of the best-written WWII accounts of war, focusing on a disastrous Allied military operation near the end of the war. Brilliantly organized, with characters fully realized on both sides, this book is a must-read. Don't miss this fine dissection of a huge strategic misfire."
4,A Bridge Too Far is very well documented,"the book is another example of Cornelius Ryan's superb research. A good read, too."
3,Good detail but much too dry,"You can tell that Ryan has done tremendous research into Operation Market Garden. But his writing style comes off as much too dry for anyone but the most avid WW II enthusiast. I am very much interested in this topic, but am not a rabid WW II fanatic. As such, I have tried no less than 6 times to read this book and can never finish it. I usually get to about 1/3 of it and have to put it back on the shelf.So be forewarned, it will not appeal to people with a passing intereset in WW II."
4,Mini Drill Press,Great for small craft jobs especially at the $74 I paid for it on sale. Bigger jobs would require a larger tool.
5,Great read,Entertaining. Can't put this book down once started. That is Asimov though. The organization and flow just simply make this an enjoyable and educational experience.
1,real bad print,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who was very disappointed with the picture quality of the dvds. On The 1st dvd for example the last half hour could not be viewed at all. It wouldn't even let him use the forward option."
1,pile of junk promoted as a good stereo,"yeah, ""antiskip"" my lilly white a*s. every little crack in the road makes the cd skip with this player.total waste of $120."
2,Too tall for fit,"Well made, nice chamois. I am 5'9"" and high waisted- these fit very low on the hips and barely covered my knees even when ordering a size bigger than I normally wear."
2,Sound issues and the original,"I have the original soundtrack on LP, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Richard Rogers himeself. It's my father's and needless to say, it does not get much play time for preservation sake. I also own both CDs ""Victory at Sea"" and ""MORE Victory at Sea,"" (BMG Music 1992) both conducted by Robert Russel Bennett and contain slightly arraigned versions of the very familar complete soundtrack by the RCA Symphony Orchestra and is remixed in extremely good Dolby Surround. The original soundtrack is fairly clear and does sound a little tinny and was recorded in mono. (Unless it was a dual issue in both stereo and mono. I only have the mono.) While a properly mixed original soundtrack would sound great, IMHO, the Dolby version would sound even better. What I'm getting at is, it's not the soundtrack's fault this apparently sounds so bad. I really wanted to buy this, but I think I'll hold off and wait and see."
2,Count The Number of Episodes!,"There are clearly supposed to be 26 episodes on the three DVD's. By the time I completed the series, it was obvious that there were only 4 episodes on each of the 3 DVD's, and I didn't get to them till 10 days after my Return Availability expired! My 3 DVD's have a total of 12 episodes, out of the 26 indicated. Therefore, I received less than 50% of what I paid for. Immediately upon receipt, put each DVD in your player and see how many episodes that you have received!"
2,There's A Much Better Alternative,"The audio problems mentioned in these reviews are correct. The music is much too high and the narration much too low. Constant adjustment of the volume is necessary. Beyond that the writing is often poor and some of the footage staged. This is a corny 50s TV production and can't be recommended.But what your looking for is out there. It's called The World At War, a 70s British production. This is a classy, often brilliant documentary with a comprehensive treatment of WWII, including the Battle of the Atlantic. Compelling narration by Laurence Olivier, numerous interviews with real participants (e.g. Hitler's secretary) and historians (a young Stephen Ambrose), and fascinating footage."
1,Victory at Sea,"The History channel should be ashamed of this effort. I have seen the PBS broadcasts and indeed the original broadcasts on NBC in the 50""s All were quality B&W; films.This DVD has, aside from the audio problems mentioned in other reviews, has muddy, low contrast, all gray images commensurate with 10th generation dubs. Viewing and listening are an unpleasant experience."
3,Victory at Sea DVD collection,"Superior historical footage; interesting and informative. Black and white footage filmed in realtime during the conflict truly amazing. As a historical document, interesting for the 1950's perspective on America's war at sea. Not very detailed on the efforts of other nations- perhaps more accurately named ""America's Victory at Sea""; nonetheless, I had seen the shows on cable and thought enough of them to make this purchase. DVD quality good, no problems with the disks themselves. Even my kids liked it. As an aside, two friends asked to borrow this set after I mentioned it in passing; neither had previously disclosed any great interest in U.S. WWII naval history, and both thought it good."
1,One star too many!,"What an unmitigated hustle this dvd collection turned out to be. Equal portions of venom and spite are hereby awarded to History Channel and NBC for this travesty. My 5.1 dts sound system did nothing to alleviate the worse than poor sound quality/balance issues. This legendary series and it's participants certainly deserve better than this quick and dirty rendition gives. Maybe the capital ""H"" seen in the lower right hand corner of the teevee screen actually stands for ""hustle"". I would gladly purchase a remastered and remixed set but for now am left with this doorstop."
2,Video is great; Audio is HORRIBLE,"The History Channel and NBC NEWS should be ashamed of themselves for putting out this long awaited DVD version of Victory at Sea. I watched these shows as a kid back in the 50s and waited for the DVD version. I was warned by someone that the sound wasn't great, but I bought the set anyway. Big mistake. You have to watch some of them with a remote in your hand to constantly raise and lower the sound. The narration is too low and the music is too loud. A review on another website defending the DVD set said that there is a warning on the box that says ""audio levels may vary"". Yeah, right, but the sites that sell the DVDs don't point that out. This was very disappointing. I can't, and won't, recommend this set to anyone."
2,2 STARS FOR EXPECTED CONTENT 0 STARS FOR SOUND,"Ever since I had my first DVD player I wanted to get Victory At Sea. It turned out to be quite a disapointment. The sound track leaves much to be desired. When the DVD starts the music is wonderfull, as soon as the first part goes on you know the sound and effects will be and are awfull.The sound is low and lifeless.The sound is most of what makes the stories come alive. I own the CDs of this music and they are great. These DVDs seem as though they were copied from an old tape and never enhanced. I know the stories, I have the tapes, these DVDs are a rip off.Joel Powell"
1,Hold onto Your VHS Version,"If you are familiar with this classic World War II series, you know that it deserves the praise it has accumulated over the years. Do not, however, buy the DVD version. The sound is absolutely terrible! I bought the DVD set only to return it. I bought it again from a second source only to run into the same poor quality sound problem. There is no excuse for this wonderful documentary to be released on DVD in such inferior quality."
1,An absolute disgrace!,"I bought this great documentary and was appalled by what I saw AND TRIED TO LISTEN TO. The makers of this DVD should immediately issue a refund to all who have purchased this disgraceful production. It is simply inconceivable in this day and age that a product so sloppy and horribly mixed could be issued to the public. Even a child could do a better job of equalizing the sound levels between the almost-inaudible narration and the overpowering music. SHAME ON ALL CONNECTED WITH THIS ABORTION. How ironic that I myself waited so long for the DVDs to come out (rather than buy the videos) so that I would be able to maximize the pleasures I remembered from the series in the 50's, and my reward was probably the most absymal DVDs ever issued by so-called ""professionals"". It would be fitting if they were never ever allowed to practice their non-existant skills again and were condemned to listen to this audio atrocity for eternity."
3,NO!! Do not order from Emson!!,"There is a review by John Stachler ""jpstax"" here and he states he's ordering the 26 episode collection from a company called Emson. I bought this set and it's AWFUL!! Yes, the sound is good, but the video is HORRENDOUS!! They used a compression algorithm that is WAY to tight. In order to get the episodes on 2 discs, they compressed the H*** out of it and it is almost unwatchable. The highlights are all blown out and it's absolutely bad, bad, bad. Do NOT waste your money!!"
1,EMSON SUCKS,"Don't buy anything from EMSON, this company sucks. They took my money and didn't deliver the product!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Great original film footage, so-so DVD","What remastering? The sound track has some sections were the sound slows down, some of the original film footage has scratches, this should have been taken care of. Concerning the sound volume, there is susposed to be variability, like a classical score with vocals; the music volume decreases during the vocals, and is free to reach higher volumes when the vocals are absent. This soundtrack is not designed for background music, it augments the video, adding to the stirring emotional quality of the film. There is a little mismatch, but I find it minimal. The original film footage is so outstanding, it is worth viewing even now."
5,A great introduction to WW2 history,"For the person who wants to learn what the war at sea was about in World War II, there is no better way than to watch these films. Although the films came out in the 1950s, they have more than stood the test of time. The pictures, music and narration are the best ever. If you have been not moved by what happened during those terrible years, these films will certainly do that.My wife told me she used to watch the TV when she was five years old and was transfixed by them. I cannot think of a better recommendation than that. I even watch these from time to time myself to refresh my memory."
2,Problems!,"I must agree with the audio comments.It would be very costly, but this series deserves full digital video restoration with a re-recorded soundtrack.I have a complete DVD set I bought in Australia years ago: Although not digitally restored, everything, narration and music, is balanced as in the original. The original score was not recorded in the best available manner even for 1952, and is very bandwidth limited (tinny)."
4,Memories,It was great to see these episodes after so many years. I am looking forward for other family members to see this series.
4,Victory at Sea,"I first saw Victory at Sea from my library. Their set wasn't in good condition, so I decided to get a better set for myself. I was not dissapointed. Some of the battle scenes were a little long without commentary, with music that was sometimes corny, or inappropriate for the current scene, and we could've done without the poetry in the Battle for Paleau and other Pacific islands. But Victory at Sea was about the sea, and I saw and learned whole new parts of WWII that were not shown in World at War. World at War also had the Battle of the Atlantic and the Pacific Theater, while Victory at Sea did show one or two land campaigns. But mostly Victory at Sea gives complementary marine viewpoint to the land/air based World at War. And the only series problem with volume I ever heard was during Peter Graves' opening monologue."
4,THE AUDIO ISSUE,"I would like to interject a word of caution regarding the comments about the audio quality being so bad. It appears that Victory at Sea must have fallen into public domain because it is also being offered by small public domain ""Studios"", each with varying qualities. It would be interesting to know if the copies being reviewed originated from the History Channel or were from some other source. Remember, too, that the series was broadcast in the mid-50's when the focus wasn't on sound. We were happy just to GET a picture!"
2,another poor sound mixed review,"I started to watch this with my father. I have to agree with everybody else, the sound was processed for the music, not the narration. Peter Graves opens each chapter with a short discussion. Set your audio system for the introduction, and then you must reset it for the Richard Rogers music, and then turn up the volume for narration. As everybody else writes, you can not hear the narration. N.B.C. should go into the vaults and pull the sound reels out to remaster the audio. I don't care about the idea that Roger's music could be processed in stereo. The masters most likely were recorded in mono. All they have to do is pull the music down and bring up the narration.It is ashame that many of the WWII veterans may have hearing problems to begin with. Wouldn't it benefit them to rework the audio so they can hear the program, before it's too late............."
2,Worth Having but Sound Issues are VERY Annoying,Yes this is a Classic Documentary series and has footage seen no where else. However this is the most aggravating Soundtrack of any DVD I own. SURELY they could have mixed it better! The narration is very muddy and hard to hear while the music is blasting. I read another review that said the sound was fine.That user must have a high end system with an equalizer or something. It is terrible. Also I was astounded at how many scenes are obviously staged re-creations of events. One thing I liked about the World At War is they would tell you if footage was staged. So yes go ahead and get this because the historical importance makes it worthwhile. But be prepared to aggravate others in your home if you're the only one watching this while the family is doing other things. Because to effectively hear the narration the volume will have to be set high. The music will then be VERY loud. PLEASE RE-MIX this!!
1,Terrible audio plus NO CAPTIONS or SUBTITLES!,"Like other reviewers who complained about the audio level, I had to watch the entire series with remote in hand, since the volume changes are constant: barely audible narration by Leonard Graves, then BOOMING sound for the music and battle scenes. Raise the volume high enough to understand the narration, then immediately lower the volume when the music or battle scenes start. To make matters worse, there is no closed captioning, no subtitles, no SDH (subtitled for the deaf and hard of hearing). One would expect that one of the great all-time WWII documentaries would have some type of captioning for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, which many WWII vets may, in fact, be, God bless em! Are ya listening, History Channel? Good! Cause we sure can't!"
1,Video is good-the audio is horrible,"I viewed this series only once.I couldnt take the blasting music,my thumb developed a blister fromturning the audio up and down through out the whole series.I went out and got the VHS series last week.The video and sound are excellent.The only problem with the VHS set is they dont separate the episodes with theending ""V"" and the beginning of the next episode with the music,so it makes it very difficult to find aspecific episode.When I copy these on to dvd on my computer,I will have to separate and put the music in before each episode myself. I think it would have been nice if they had done that already like the originalseries was."
4,Victory at Sea,"Received this Victory at Sea DVD quickly from Amazon and popped it into my playback unit. The Richard Rogers-scored theme music and all the black and white videos of the awesome effort that went into winning WWII took me back to my high school days when I watched the original series on TV. The product obviously has been transferred from original 35mm films, but the quality of the picture and sound is quite good. Definitely worth the cost of the purchase, just for the historical value. Good to help explain to kids these days the heritage of our nation, and what their forebears thought was important to fight for, in a campaign that took this major logistical effort."
2,And they wonder why ....,"I have several options in copying many of the DVDs I rent. I rented this DVD from Netflix and it was of such a poor quality that I didn't even copy it. I'm back on Amazon looking for a good Audio CD of the soundtrack and it seems that there is none to be found. As a matter of fact, one reviewer of one of the Audio CDs was hoping that the Video DVD would offer some relief. Sorry, no help here."
2,Poor sound makes for bad DVDs,"My disappointment with this DVD set stems from my expectations. I thought that time and effort would have been taken to enhance the video in the this digital format since Victory at Sea seriesis a classic. In comparison with my VHS version of the series the video is no better or worse. Where the DVD is truly lacking is the audio which of its self is a great part of the cache ofthe series. The audio was so poorly done as to be upsetting. I had to turn up the volume control of my system by three time the setting I used with the VHS tapes which I used for a comparsion. The voice of the announcer was not melded in with the sound level of the music as was the case with the VHS tapes. Consequently,I was fidgeting with the volume control frequently. Cannonade from artillery or of the large gunsof ships would boom the volume of the audio off scale requiring another audio adjustment.My advice to anyone interested in this series-truly a classic-would be to buy the VHS tapes."
3,Outstanding Historic Video with the poorest sound possible,"The story of WWII on DVD. I saw the original broadcasts on early TV, saw 16mm films of the series while in the service, own the VHS and have just made the error of buying the DVD. The Series is outstanding, even though four years of warfare around the world is condensed into 26 episodes of approximately 30 minutes each. The graphic pictures, the running commentary, and the tantalizing backround music make for an OUTSTANDING historical documentary of the times, but this DVD version with it's poor audio recording detracts greatly from the viewers enjoyment. Buy the VHS, by all means."
3,5 Stars for original documentary - 2 stars for DVD transfer,"Excellent documentary about our brave fighting men of WWII. Anyone who's ever wondered why the depression/WWII generation is often refered too as ""The Greatest Generation"" need only to watch this documentary to find out. Made before the America hating looney left took over our media, when it was still okay to be unashamedly patriotic.Unfortunately, the audio transfer to DVD was badly botched. The narrator's voice is barely audible when the musical score is played at a normal volume. You basically have to blast the musical score to make out what the narrator is saying.Maybe I'll try watching it again with the surround sound turned off. Sometimes the transfer doesn't work very well when they try to take an old program that was origninally done in mono and transfer it to a surround sound DVD."
3,"documentary footage is precious, but","the sound track, the music score is very annoying and disturbing. although the music was composed by the 'south pacific' composer, obviously is not appropriate at all for this documentary, and most of the time, the music itself only distant from the scenes we're watching. it's a terrible choice by the nbc production. we have to either turn down the tv audio volume or muted it completely. the other thing bothered us is that there are so many repeatedly footage appeared in different locations and time frames, obviously doctored and edited poorly by the same production team. kept bombarded by the annoying score, shaddy and obscure narrator 's bad voice over, with the repeatedly shown footage again and again, made this supposed to be good documentary become so tiresome and so impatient to watch. what a shame."
2,Simply Tacky!,"I have to agree with a previous poster that most of the projects in here are pretty tacky. Examples- decorating a pumpkin with mardi gras beads, or putting glitter on coin rolls to hand out for Halloween. And there must be 7 or 8 diferent examples of the same painting of candle holders, just for different seasons of the year. In all I found 3 or 4 itmes I may be interested in making. Not very creative. Not worth buying in my opinion."
3,Some good ideas,"There are some good ideas, but overall the crafts are kistchy. Very little elegance, a lot of bright poofy things."
3,Some nice ideas,I thought some of these Ideas were nice. I really liked the card ideas they had and some of the centerpiece ideas as well. I thought some of the other ideas werent that pretty based on their examples but with a little creativity you can build off their idea and make something nicer. Overall about 2/3s of the book had good nifty ideas I wanted to try.
2,365 Crafts,I wasn't that impressed with this book. In fact I accidentally have bought this book twice and when I got it the second time I was disappointed. Out of the entire book I did one craft project. It was definitely not what I thought.
3,You don't have to be a witch to develop an interest in herbs...,"I'd encourage anyone to proceed with caution and be ready and willing to black out any information or beliefs you strongly disagree with.While I generally, found this to be a very good reference with many very interesting recipes to address a wide range of interests, my intention in writing this review is primarily as a warning to those who shun magic, sorcery, witchcraft and all the rest, in fact I had to subtract a star from the rating.I found the very last chapter of the book to be very disturbing and unexpected as it was (no longer in my book) a chapter on using herbs in magic. I ripped the section out of the book (thankfully is was only 20 pages or less) and blacked out all references to any matter dealing with the occult. My heart sank to discover the section, and for this reason alone, while I find the book useful, I won't look for any of the author's other work, nor do I care to know any more about her than I already do."
5,delightful,i found all this information highly useful. i have been making stuff and love using all natural stuff.
4,"Not perfect, but damn close","If you are curious as to what is this recent trends towards Brazilian, I urge you to go out and get 'In Brazil.' The 2 disc set is split into two - CLASICO, which are Brazilian tunes from the 80s and 70s, and 'Ahora', which reflect more recent, housey, and breakbeat-themed tunes.Portuguese is a romantic language, and to hear it to some funky tunes throws it over the top/ I especially enjoy the 'Clasico' CD especially, as it contains the sound elements that are heard in many of today's Brazilian tunes. And be sure to check out the original version of 'Sob O Mar' - beautiful."
3,Prefer Gilles Peterson In Africa,"I don't pretend to be a Gilles Peterson or a Brazilian music expert, but neither is everyone reading a review of this album, so here goes. Another album, Gilles Peterson In Africa, completely blew my mind right from first listen and remains some of the best music I've ever heard. I was expecting something similar from Gilles Peterson In Brazil, and didn't get it. In Brazil felt a little too well-manicured. The 50s/60s patio party vibe of Disc 1 borders on overbearing. That's my opinion for the other non-experts interested in dabbling in Gilles Peterson."
2,Boring and redundant,"After reading the first couple of chapters I should have stopped reading because the authors merely rehashed what they had already said. The book basically tells you to relax and clear your emotions. If you do, you set the ground to possibly have a Breakout or Peak Experience. The book is boring and redundant."
1,Old wine in new bottles,"This is a hard book to finish. The good doctor belabors the material with a particularly annoying baby talk style. The book wears thin quickly after the first couple chapters. Most of the ""revolutionary"" material consists of concepts already espoused in many prior books on creativity. This book should be listed as an example of ""literary fluff"" in a dictionary. Don't bother."
2,Well....... didn't meet expectations,"I thought this book would be more, or read like more, to me.... I ended up scanning some passages because of the telling of individuals' stories that permiate the book. I came away with a couple of things to think about, but on balance, I thought there was just too much ""filler"" and not enought ""there""..there. Good concepts, but not enough for a book..... and not so different than what others have proposed in other books. Just a different take. Would have made a nice pamphlet."
2,Empty,"Pretty much anything you enjoy doing can be a source of ""The Breakout Principle."" There. I've read the book for you."
2,soaps smell wayyyy too strong!,"These soaps are very pretty and carved, and look just the way I wanted them to. However, they are so overly perfumed and so strong smelling they give me a headache and make me almost sick. They seem like they are artificially scented, since most natural scents don't cause headaches. i really regret buying them and doubt I can use them."
5,Orchid of the Bayou: A Deaf Woman Faces Blindness,"This is a great book-helps you understand what people with Ushers Syndrome go through. The author is very real and honest. Once you start, can't put it down!"
4,"OK, but not simple!","The utilization of colors makes it more difficult than the basic numbers used in sudoku. The presentation of the game (nicely finished wood board, marbles) is nice."
5,Amazing! Not Your Father's Sudoku,"This game is remarkably better than the numerical version of Sudoku. The maker's clever use of color variations (rather than traditional numerical distinctions) makes it more accessible to those who can, at times, fall among the numerically ""challenged,"" even as it provides a completely new challenge to advanced players who may be approaching complacent proficiency with the more traditional numerical version of the game. I was impressed (and surprised, given the price) by the beauty of the wooden board and the tasteful colors of the wooden spheres. Puzzle cards are used to create ranges of difficulty from easy to challenging to ""really tough"" and they are easy to use. Kudos to the creators of this delightful game, which is also a handsome coffee table accessory."
4,Newest Addiction,I saw this in one of my magazines I recieved around the holidays as an idea to give as a gift. So I decided to try it out myself. It quickly became my addiction. I love the idea of keeping it out on a coffee table or something. When i'm stuck I walk away and do something else than come back to it. I gave it a 4 out of 5 for a few reasons. The light purple and light blue are hard to differientate in lower lighting. They would have been better off adding a teal or something to help them not look so similiar. You really have to pay attention with the cards to set up each round the dark blue and dark people look similar that i've been stumped on a puzzle only to realize I mixed up the colors when setting it up. The only other thing that would make this perfect would be some kind of container or hidden drawer to keep the pieces together. I always have grap a cereal bowl or ziploc back to keep them together.
5,I'm Hooked!,"This was a great buy! I'm a sudoku addict and I find it's even more fun than a standard sudoku! I leave the board and a started puzzle out on my coffee table (it's good quality wood so it looks great on it), and I put all the balls in a bowl. I play alone a lot, but when friends or family are hanging out in the living room, we take turns completing the puzzles together. The kit comes with 104 cards for setting up puzzles, but it also gives you a code so you can ""translate"" any traditional number sudoku from newpapers, books, or wherever, into this version that uses colors. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and it arrived faster than listed. I would buy this as a gift for any sudoku lover."
3,not well painted,"fun idea, but like others have mentioned, some of the colors are not easy to distinguish, and it can be difficult to keep track of which marbles were set up for the game and which were added later during play. it would be nicethe marbles are lovely to look at in a glass bowl. it would be nice if there was space in the box to just toss them in alongside the board. having to place them back into the indentation, though, makes sure you check for runaway marbles before storing the game. the game cards come in a perforated sheet, with a fold-it-yourself box to store them in. the problem is once they are ripped apart and stacked into the box, you can't store them with the gameboard and marbles in the original package.we had some problems with some of the marbles being lightly stuck to the gameboard because of the stain/paint. they came out easily, but left marks on the marbles and in the indentations of the board. wondering how long-lasting the paint will be on the marbles."
4,Color Sudoku puzzle,"This game has kept me occupied during the cold days of winter--it seems easier than it is--more than once I have gotten down to the last piece and found that it did not go there --then other pieces had to be moved--and I am still at the ""easy"" level!! I am improving, however, and I think I am learning to think more logically."
4,Much prettier than a puzzle printed on paper and demonstrates Suduko is about logic but not about numbers,"Would be better with a small set of mini-balls to use to mark spaces that could be one of two or one of three colors (like you can do by writing on the printing paper ones), but we figured out how to make a set for ourselves and it's a great addition to an already very good game."
4,Entertainment for all ages,"I bought this game for my 9 year old nephew for Christmas and he really enjoyed it. It's less intimidating than the numerical version of Sudoku and he caught on fairly fast. His 4 year old brother even helped put in the marbles in the right places and while he didn't quite understand the rules he seemed to enjoy trying to catch on. The wooden board it comes with is very sturdy and well crafted. My only complaint would be that the maker of the toy doesn't supply any holding container for all of the colored marbles, so it's a bit cumbersome to put away when you're done. However, I would recommend this game to any parent who enjoys Sudoku and wants to teach their children the game! The best part about it is that any Sudoku puzzle you can find online is easily translatable to this version. I highly recommend it!"
3,not for people with vision problems,"Since my dad loves sudukos so much, I thought this would be a nice change for him. But the ""cheat sheets"" are so small, it's really hard to tell a couple of the colors from each other when you are trying to read the cards. Also as people age, they have a harder time telling shades of blue and green for example - so it would have been better to make one of the colored marble sets white and another color black, instead of shades of the same color. I ended up giving it to my newphew and he likes it!"
5,"7-year-old loves it...and now ""gets"" Sudoku","This is a very high-quality game. I bought this for my 7-year-old, who was trying to understand how I did Sudoku puzzles. Very soon in our first Colorku game, it ""clicked"" for her. She loves to play this game. Right now she's doing really well with the Easy puzzles, but she needs some guidance on the Moderate ones. This will definitely be a game she can play for a while.My take on a few criticisms that other reviewers had:- We don't really have a problem with the fact that there's not a carrying case for the balls. We just leave them in place after a game and cover them with the plastic lid.- We've had no problem differentiating between colors."
4,"Nice, but I wish the colors could be stacked","I bought this for my kids thinking it'd be more fun than using a pencil and paper, and I think that's mainly worked out well - the board is big, it's easy to move the pieces, the kids can easily work together, and it doesn't feel like doing a school worksheet. But the downside is that the colors are spheres, and can't be stacked, or placed to the side - they roll. So you can't easily mark that a particular spot could take one of two colors - once you've put a color there it looks just like the colors you placed initially to set up the puzzle (unlike, say, a printed puzzle where you can distinguish between your own writing and the pre-printed part of the puzzle). So while I like this product, and we're having fun with it, I think it could have been even better by making the colored pieces more like stackable poker chips so that you could temporarily stack several someplace, or put some next to a spot or some such."
4,Mostly thrilled with the game,"The game itself is great...really gets you thinking. My only complaint is the packaging. When it originally arrived, the game cards come in perforated sheets and the box for holding them is flat. Smaller packaging...I get it. Once you put the cards together and get them in their little box, the game and cards do not fit in the big box with the lid on. Minor...just a bit annoying."
5,Fun for All,"I ordered this for my grandson who is turning seven. It was recommended to me by an aftercare teacher. What fun this is. He played it by himself and then we played together. Sometimes it is a family thing, and we all sit around the colorful board and play as one team. This is a fun and challenging game. We are still playing the easier setups, but are working out way to the more difficult."
1,blah!!! buy deep purple new album Bananas!,"avoid this! buy Deep Purple new album BANANAS!UNSATISFIED EGOS for the new mundane songs! the cd has full of clichees! it is a fact that Mick Jagger still needs money from all fans!! The songs are uninspired outside his Stones activities. I said WHAT A unsatisfied egos!! the songs are boring, Mick just titled himself as the best Rock and roll singer in the world just because he is a big boss of stones.PS:Deep Purple one the greatest Hardrock contemporary on earth is on the studio again by producing their new album BANANAS. The Purple new album has composed most of good songs and freshing sounds....Deep Purple is also an old band like Beatles and Stones, but they always produce new LPs and albums for their fans. As a result the PURPLE new album BANANAS got many good critics....see the reviews of BANANAS!!!"
5,5 STAR,"THIS IS A MASTERPEAC WITH ONE OF THE BEST SONGS JAGGER HAS DONE WITH OR WITHOUT THE STONES ANGLE IN MY HEART IS WORTH THE WHOLE CD BUT IT ALSO HAS SWEET THING,DONT TEAR ME UP AND MORE PICK IT UP"
4,Mick Jagger-Wandering Spirit,"This album gels, I mean man it rocks like Mick can. Produced by Rick Rubin if that rings a bell. Mick is the entertainer of the universe, forget David Bowie and Sting. OK-Rod Stewart and Elton John give him a race for the watering hole! But now seriously isn't Mick like the one dude we all pretend to be in the shower? Hasn't he been there since the beginning of time and carried us all the way through practically everything--like love, marriage, family, divorce, death, wealth and poverty? Let's all give thanks for Mick and forget the Beatles(Paul McCartney)who jumped ship like decades ago. This is a great album by a great artist of all time anywhere handsdown."
4,Middle aged and proud!,"This was a far better album than any Rolling Stones album put out in the 90's. Mick snarls very nicely on the rockers and does a credible job on the ballads. The ballads were refreshingly mature. Mick knew by this point he wasn't getting any younger and the songs reflected this. The middle of the album really revs up. Think, Mother of a Man, and the title cut, Wandering Spirit, kick ass in a way that makes you wish Mick did more solo stuff. I love Keith and Charlie and Ronnie but, this album would not have been this good if they were on board. Mick also did another project around this time called Mick Jagger and the Red Devils. It was never officially released. This was a full on blues project well worth hunting down. Mostly 40's and 50's covers of Muddy Waters and Little Walter stuff. I have no idea what got into Mick in the early 90's but I'm glad we have these two documents of whatever it was."
4,I bought it for 1 song,"""Don't Tear me Up"" which is great - don't listen much to the rest, maybe I will..."
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty good album, but far from a great one. And when I listen to my favorite song on this album, ""Don't Tear Me Up"", I like it, but can't help but think, ""If he'd saved this song to do with the Stones, it would have been GREAT!"""
2,Not Enough Content,"I ride motorcycles, but do not know much about how to fix them.I ordered both this and the Clymer Manual at the same time. This book is too summarized and does not provide enough photos or details. Thank goodness for Amazon return policy. The Clymer is 461 pages, provides a better how-to-do and more illustrations."
2,Disappointment from a great artist,"This album is disappointing - schlocky ballads and soupy arrangements spoil it. Melissa Manchester has written many good songs, but the songs here are mainly written by ultra-commercial songwriters-for-hire. The whole thing is contrived, and will disappoint you if you enjoy Melissa's earlier albums. And I dare anyone to listen to the final track without losing their lunch."
3,MELLOW MELISSA,"Melissa was one of our first pop divas with tunes like ""Midnight Blue,"" ""Just You and I,"" ""Don't Cry Out Loud,"" and my favorite, ""Better Days."" This 1995 release evokes memories of her hey-days, but also has some maudlin or treacly tunes as well.The best cuts are her strong emotional ballads utilizing her passionate expressive vocals. Songs like the title cut, ""In a Perfect World,"" ""To Be in Love with Me,"" and ""Higher Ground"" are good examples of her vocal prowess. She does a good cover of the Doobies Brothers' ""Here to Love You"" but it lacks the original's funky energy. ""Crazy People"" might be fun but seems grossly out of place on this album and her duet ""Don't Let Me Walk This Road Alone"" is easily forgotten.For prime Manchester, go back to her 70's disc, ""Better Days and Happy Endings.""IF MY HEART HAD WINGS has some great moments, but not my favorite collection."
4,Chester is wonderfully twisted in words and images,"I like the guy - he's sick, obsessive compulsive, and knows how to draw. What more needs to be said?"
1,Worse than 'The Poor Bastard'!,"It's getting hard to trust Amazon reviews- Amazon themselves and Publishers' Weekly are obviously taking a cut and raving about rubbish; and authors' friends are obviously doing a good job of peer-marketing and raving about rubbish.But whereas Joe Matt TRIES HARD to be neurotic (and nothing fails worse), Brown is just disgusting for its own sake- the whole thing is basically one long exercise in scatology. That and the artwork is very rarely anything like passable."
4,Two different sides,"The first five tracks of this album are out of this world, however the other part of the album is not that enjoyable to listen to. The song, ""the east from the west"" is my kinda definition for smooth jazz. all in all this album is a good buy for any smooth jazz lover."
3,So So,"Knowing Boz Scaggs music since the early 70's and seeing him in concert a number of times, I feel I know his music! This cd falls short of the many great songs like ""Someone Loan Me a Dime,"" and ""Georgia."" It seems Boz needed a filler album, and this fit his bill.Sorry Boz, I dig your music, but this cd is not at the top of my list."
4,Ipi Ntombi - an Excellent African Muciscal,I first seen this production and heard the sound track on Public Television...... It has a story line that is fantastic. The Dancing is excellent. THe Singers not only make you feel like you are there they bring out the feeling of each and every song.This production is a must see. The music. is uplifting and true african tribal with a bit more upbeat.
3,Ipi Ntombi South African Musical,"The music of Ipi Ntombi Musical was excellent. However, It was not the original Cast Recording stated by the advertisement. It was a recent recording performed by the children and Grandchildren of the original Cast. I really wanted the Original Cast Recording performed in the 70's and 80's."
4,A Must for Opus Fans!,"This one has all one would expect form Berke Breathed - Opus, Bill, Cross-Dressing Cockroaches, Elvis tribute carolers and pork with self-image issues. I loved it when it was first on TV and it hasn't lost any of it's humor, wit or pathos."
5,Not your typical Chrstmas special,"We've all seen the typcical Christmas specials that air on tv....all the way from Charlie Brown to How the Grinch Stole Christmas to the classic Rankin and Bass specials and they are indeed wonderful childhood memories for those of us who were brought up with them. But somewhere in the 90's came along a different Christmas show that broke a mold and set different theme....A Wish for Wings That Work was exactly that. It didn't play to the mass commercialism and over-marketing strategies for the season nor did it portay any of the typical themes we've all been used to before. ""A Wish for Wings"" is wonderful and when I saw this it was good back then and it's still good now. It's a nice little story and it does have the one message....that regardless of our short-comings we are all truely special in some way."
5,The funniest animated short of all time!,"Its the little things that stick with you when a film gives you as big a chuckle as ""A Wish For Wings That Work"" gave me. Like Opus' backside falling off, and the gulls say ""its like a tire....its replaceable!"". Bill having been rescued from the science lab after ""his brains were replaced with tater tots"". Milhouse the cockroach, dressed in full drag, mistakenly showing up at the sensitivity group for flightless fowl, asking ""is this Cockroach Cross-dressers in Crisis?"". I have watched this treasure year after year since its one and only broadcast when my children were small, and my now grown kids and I never fail to hoot with laughter. What a gift!"
2,"Good story, lousy media","Big Opus fan. We loved the book. The movie is good, but the disc was awful.It refused to play on two of our Blu-Ray players (different makes and models), so we ended up having to watch it on an old Sony portable DVD player where it worked fine. When inserted into one PC it just seeks forever (blinking light, motor whirring up and down) and hangs the PC (everything is stuck waiting on reading the media). When inserted into another PC with Slysoft AnyDVD, it said there was no media in the drive. When inserted into a third PC it worked fine.It was clean with no scratches or other marks, just couldn't be read by most players in our house. Since this is a newer release, I'm guessing the studio tried to add some sort of new copy protection scheme, but that's just a guess. Could just be bad quality control or cheap blanks.In any case, I would suggest getting the other version, the older release without the bonus music CD, unless you have multiple DVD players to try this in."
5,ALLLL-batross!,It's wonderful to have this smart little show on DVD. It's multi-layered humor works for my five-year-olds and myself as well. It's a bonus to have your favorite comic characters brought to life.
5,My all-time favorite Xmas video!,"After wearing out my copy of this video from its TV airing years ago, I was thrilled to find it available for purchase. This will make an Opus fan of you if you are not already one."
5,Opus and Bill and Me,I have waited for too many years for this wonderful program to appear on DVD. My tape of the original show is worn out and I can barely wait to receive the DVD. A true Christmas classic that is finally available. Yay!
5,A suprising treat for everyone in the family,"Berke Breathed does a fantastic job of bringing a surprisingly touching Christmas story to the small screen. Short of an entire staff of Disney employees and computers, the soft colors and shades of his animation are the best you'll ever see, and the music is terrific. It's a wonder this isn't a regular feature during the Holiday season. Guaranteed to make you laugh, no matter what age you are, and sure to bring the true spirit of Christmas to even the Grinchiest of people."
3,Digital Remastered?,My boyfriend and I have been watching a Wish for wings that work since we have been together! We used to rent it at the video store but they had gotten rid of it. I found a VHS copy and I was so excited to see this on Amazon! I got it yesterday and It said it was Digitally remasterd however it looked very grainy. I was surprised at the low quality of the colors. They looked very muted. I However love this cartoon and the memories it brings!
4,Wish for Wings,"I suddenly remembered this amazing special last night, only to discover that it is available on DVD as of TODAY. How strange. It is such a classic. Heartwarming and a great treat for all ages."
5,A Doonesbury Christmas,"For those who are lovers of Opus, Bill the Cat, and the rest of the gang from Doonesbury, this DVD is a must. The humble story of how Opus helps Santa when he needs help the most is poignant and inspiring to those who are still looking for the true meaning of Christmas. I give this DVD two thumbs up."
3,A wish for better quality,"I am a huge fan of Berkley Breathed. I used to own every single one of his books (until the divorce). This video was disappointing. The story meanders heavily and strays frequently into the unnecessary. There is not enough emotion conveyed over Opus' predicament. Lastly, the picture quality stinks badly. It looks like it was made back in the seventies. Casual viewers beware and Bloom County fans don't expect much. The book this video was based upon was much better."
4,Who doesn't love Opus,"Our family favorite for Christmas. DVD quality is clean and clear, though still in low def. I wish there were some extra features such as ""making of"" or something else to go along with it. This is just the original TV program."
5,"Very, very, very good book!","The last several books I've read each day have left me thinking, ""Hmm, that was enjoyable but not much to it."" Well, this is a really good book. It's well-written, the characters come alive and you feel as though you know them well. It's heart-wrenching at times too - my favorite kind of book. I could not put it down. This is a defininte must read."
2,I don't know about the other reviews but...,"I thought this book was awful. The only thing about this book that was good was the secondary characters, James and Annie. Adam the ""hero"" constantly let Maggie know her position in his life as his mistress,not anyone who he would consider marrying. He constantly called her derogatory terms which I will not repeat. The first chapter of the book Adam was great and it goes downhill from there. Maggie rarely showed any backbone towards Adam, but it is hard to blame her because she is an innocent. After reading this book I felt disappointed in love. James the secondary character should have been the main character. He treated women the way they should be treated. I bought this book because of the other reviews and I am extremely disappointed with it."
5,Superb! Our compliments to the Chefs! *Burp!*,"The Chef Who Died Sauteing is a full course mystery of flavorful characters, police procedurals, human psychology, and psychic phenomenon. The precise placement of clues are all honed as a place setting at a fine eatery, and the subject matter blends a variety of tastes perfectly balanced to keep the diner entertained in exquisite anticipation of the ""just desserts"". Finkelstein and Smily are your chefs of the evening, and this is one menu that won't have you leaving feeling empty!I and my family eagerly await the next installments in what surely will prove to be the next must reads on our list the moment they are released! Ariel Quigley and Bernice Wise are characters who have captured the imaginations of my whole family. We are eager to curl up together and explore our love of mystery, ghost stories, and the intricacies of the lives of these two budding detectives."
4,Cute mystery story,"I liked the book as I read more and more of it. It was not one of my favorites, but I kept reading it to find out ""who dun it"". The characters have potential to be very good, they need to be fleshed out a little bit. I would read sequels to this book as I have noticed characters usually get better and better in a book series. I would recommend it."
2,Too drawn out,"I was unable to finish this book, it just kept going on and on with too many unnessary small details. Reading what each charecter is thinking time and time again was too much. I think it had some good ""bones"", but somehow it didn't work for me."
2,Badly written,"I had a number of problems with this novel. First, the author desperately needed some practice of the writer's rule: Show don't tell. She had the characters' telling boring long paragraph after paragraph of their lives when a sentence would have sufficed. And that Ariel goes to her writing student's house for the first time for lunch and by meal's end is moving in there to live; it just didn't ring true. The characters were not very likeable and the twins really seemed immature. I couldn't get through more than 3 chapters; by then couldn't have cared less about The Chef Who Died Sauteing."
5,mystery,"I loved this book, it kept me captivated from the start. The added charm of ghosts is a bonus to the story. would recommend to anyone who likes a mystery."
4,one of those just one more page before going to bed book.,Good read. Finished in one sitting because I wanted to find out what would happen next. Characters were interesting and likable. Story moved along nicely.
3,Good for a quick read,"I read this book in one sitting and enjoyed it. Love the recipes and plan to try a couple of them. This is one of those books that you read, then have to think for a minute if someone asks what it's about."
3,"Great for individual study, but not so good for Group Study","The author teaches a great way to study the bible but it is tedious. Great for the individual who likes the method of study, but not so good for Group Study unless all in your group are willing to use the same method of word identification and research."
1,empty package,Hi there! I received an empty package without the book. I am frustrated trying to figure out how to talk to someone about it.
2,Bore-acracy,"I have just finished reading this book as a selection by my book club. I've only read Didion's ""A Year of Magical Thinking"" and a few essays prior to this ""novel"". Joan should stick to essays and first person accounts. Democracy, as another reviewer stated, is a compliation of glimpses. Everything is glimpses and in order to fill it out to novel length, Didion puffs it up by adding herself as the novelist to the mix.The novel is utterly pointless, the characters are thinly developed, even the heroine, the plot is aimless, and the timeline is staggeringly difficult to keep up with. Read something else by Joan Didion - not this."
4,Love this tablecloth,It looks pretty and is surprisingly stain resitant. I have been able to remove even curry stains with a little spot treatment.
3,A flawed but interesting book,"As a native of Moscow, educated in the Soviet schools, I must take issue with the reviewers who claim the author is knowledgable about Russia or the Soviet Union. It is a commonplace among Russians that ""Russia is a country with an unpredictable past,"" and the author of this fantasy bears that out. His small understanding of Soviet history seems gleaned from the learn-books I was forced to read in elementary school - full of lies and half-truths. To even begin to understand Russia one must live there, which the author obviously has not.The book does have interesting plot. Consider it light entertainment, if you will, something to while away a rainy afternoon."
2,No vocal's severely lacking!,"Not that I don't like it, when I ordered it I did not see that It was without vocals, my error, but it just does not do the album any justice having previously having the copy with vocals, I enjoy all of pete's work. I think he is a musical genius! His music has brought me out of the funk of a bad day many a time."
3,Would Like to See a Re-release with Both Versions,"Once I finnally had an uninterupted hour to listen to this I really enjoyed it. My copy is the ""radio play"" version and I doubt I would have any clue what the story was about if it wasn't for the talking that nobody seems to like.I would love to see a re-release of this album with both versions included in one package. There are some really good songs and I don't know how many times I'm going to want to listen to the ""radio play""."
2,"I have no problem with dialogue connecting songs, BUT","This is a little too much. For me the dialogue became a major distraction. It comes right in the middle of songs and is sometimes so straight-forward and literal that it makes the wonderful abstractness of music completely absent.I normally love Townshend's style of aschewing normal rock structures and really producing what I consider high art, but Pscychodelerict can derelict my balls. (sorry for the ZOOLANDER reference)"
3,It would get more stars if not for the f'ing language,"I really got tired of hearing the f word used over and over. I loved the concept, I really liked the music, but it gets tiresome to hear the hideous language in the dialog. Pete has always peppered his tunes with colorful language, but prior to this, it was used for power and meaning. Here it goes too far."
2,Doesn't hold up to repeated listenings.,"Another concept album. ""English Boy"" is excellent and while it's not a bad CD, it doesn't, IMHO, hold up to repeated listenings. The dialogue between songs gets old fast. Maybe the music- only version is better."
5,Easy to read and informative,"As a follower of the weekly Sunday column, ""Love and Money"", I moved to a new city where Mr. Opdyke's column is not in my Sunday paper. After many unfilled Sundays, to my excitement I discovered that this book was assembled. The book is equal, if not better than the weekly series. I enjoy reading the financial and true life information that realistically plagues our married and family lives. It constantly makes me reevaluate my finances, spending, and budgeting (or I should say ""Spending Plans"").The book should be required reading for married couples. Well worth it."
5,Mother-Daughter Sexual Abuse Revealed,An amazing true story of Mother-Daughter Incest and the healing process. This book is sure to help surviors and professionals understanding the most taboo of subjects. Sandor's writing draws you in a gentle story telling kind of way. This book is a gift to the reader.
5,A Moving Story of Survival and Triumph of the Spirit,"An incredible true account of the author's experience of incest at the hands of her mother. Sandor's story is courageous, and although hellish to imagine, ultimately a testament to the healing that is possible. The writing and poetry are honest and candid without being self-indulgent. This book is a beacon for anyone who has survived sexual abuse, anyone hoping to help someone who has been victimized in this way, or anyone who wishes to be reminded of the strength of amazing grace."
5,I've been waiting for this...,"...for a long time. Thea Gilmore's US debut is wonderful. If you like folk music with a twist (like Ani Difranco), this CD is for you. She's similar to Ani, but not the same. She has many differences but she is still awsome. I particularly liked Saviours and All, This Girl is Taking Bets, Holding your Hand, and Movie Kisses. This record is great, pick it up."
3,"Fair deal, so-so recording","This was a good bargain, except for the fact it was a DVD copy of a VHS that was in so-so condition. Otherwise, it was an affordable item."
3,If you are considering for public library purchase,This book has full frontal nudity. The binding is terrible. The whole book fell apart after a dozen circs. It does have lots of color photos in it.cei
1,Fell apart the first time we read it,The photos are brilliant but the book is so poorly bound that it fell apart the moment we opened it. The book should have been a hard cover. It was cheaply produced. A real let down.
1,very disappointing,"this book is for the beginner without any experience, but save your money and buy huck spaulding's how to tattoo book for 1\3 the price. i have been a professional tattoo artist for 15 years, this book cut and pastes tattoo techniques from 10 years before i started,it is a very good attempt at collecting information from preprinted articles and internet postings compiling into a booklet that is being marketed as original instructional techniques. but for anyone with skills at tattooing this book is not for you."
3,Always check manufacture's site for specs.,This phone is NOT Quad band - it does *not* support GSM 850.
4,Good and Basic,"the z610i is a stylish, 3G cellphone with video call capacity and a good media player (nothing to envy the walkan phones). Althought the M2 memory card is expensive, it comes with a 64MB card and 20MB internal memory.The surface is clean and sweet, very fashion, but is a magnet for fingerprints and can be scratched easy.The 2MP camera is not that good, no autofocus or flash/led. It does not comes with headphones.Overall, a good phone for women: good and basic."
2,KEYLESS CHUCK FOR IMPACT DRILL,Great idea but has limitations. I used it once to drill a 3/8 inch hole in wood. The drill went into impact mode when it encoutered hard wood and locked the drill bit into the chuck. I was unable to remove the drill bit since the chuck had frozen in the locked position. I wound up destroying the chuck to retrieve my drill bit. I would only recommend using this tool for small hole drilling in which case buying a set of drills with the hex shank is cheaper than buying the chuck adapter.
5,A review of Trey,"I will go ahead and tell you this is not a review on the book. If I wrote a review on the book it would be positive anyway because of how I feel about Trey Ragsdale. I am a slow reader and read everything I can on my own feild of asset management and financial planning.Anyway, Trey Ragsdale is a first rate citizen. He really enjoys politics and lives it out in his own life. He has a strong family heritage in politics, dating all the way back to James Ogelthorpe. So he is qualified to write this book. His friend Joe put his life on the line for the US in war.All I can say is that I have learned alot from watching Trey Ragsdale think from another person's perspective and effectively build relationships with people that way. I'm sure this book, which I did buy, is an excellent one because the authors are excellent people."
2,Guiness Book of Arbitrry Records,I have to say as a person who has bought a number of the Guiness Record books over the last 15 years I found this one pretty dissapointing. There is such a focus on making things funky that it will no longer serve as a refernece for settling factual disputes. The number of records has been cut dramatically and only the sports section is still comprehensive. That said there are still as always some great pictures.
4,Guinness 2000 Book of Records: Millenium Edition (hardcover),"A very nice book, but what I am really interested in is how many of these books were misprinted with a caption saying ""Donald Trump"" and showing his butler? Are all the editions this way, or were there corrected editions printed? I am curious as to whether this is a collector's item. Thanks!"
4,FILLED WITH TONS OF INTERESTING FACTS!,"What I like most about this book is the dramatic colour and layout. Like all the previous Guinness Books, this one is jam- packed with lots of trivia, amazing facts and figures. The colour, however, is what truly sets this book apart from previous years. Each page seems to come to life and captures the reader's attention.The only downside to the book is the print, which I find a little too small for my liking. If you are young and have great vision, you will not have a problem, but for those of us who are in that mid-life age bracket and wear glasses, the small print eventually becomes very hard on the eyes."
2,"Steamy, but coool","Nino Tempo is a great saxophonist, with an interesting musical history. Everything from 60's pop, to 70's Funk, to cool jazz.This is a Fine cd, with mood music inspired by Amazon Jungle that will add substance to Enya-loving collection. Grab it!Wish his 70's album 5th AVENUE SAX would come to disk!"
4,"This is a wonderful, invaluable and unique book about grief.","This is a truly helpful book with a wide range of rituals for those who are bereaved or need to grieve for many of life's losses like the loss of a pet, a job, or even a long-held belief. Life is full of necessary losses. This book shows us how to cope with them, learn from them and understand how this part of life can be of great value to us. It also helps us to express and deal with feelings that are not accepted or encouraged in our society. I bought the book to learn how to deal with a tragic suicide that affected my family. I found it to be an invaluable source of support and comfort."
3,A bit too New age,"This was not what I thought it was when I got it. It was a bit to new age, and the rituals a bit to mundane for me."
1,Please keep on looking,"As a software developer for healthcare, I purchased this book for the purpose of understanding the HIPAA regulations that are required for software. I found this book to be very poorly written. The writing style is very disorganized and terribly painful to read."
5,Incredible as the movie,"For the first time i saw the soundtrack fitting so amazing the movie. Everytime you listen to the movie songs you remmeber some part of the film, i dunno how john brion do it. Phone call is the best song for me, simple and beautiful"
4,One of the Best Soundtracks,"I really enjoyed this CD. Especially the original material by Jon Brion. He manages to create some truly unique and compelling sounds and puts them together in a compelling way. His music was a great backdrop fot the movie's theme, quirky and supernatural.Beck's song, ""Everyone's Gotta Learn Sometime"" is also a winner, one of those hooky tunes that you can't get to stop replaying in your head. Add more great stuff from the Willowz and Polyphonic Spree and this album's quite worth the money."
4,Proper credit where needed,"I agree with Keith Brown. The Korgis came out with the song ""Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime"". I was thrilled to hear Beck sing it in the movie. Good to see time-honored music still being performed by today's artists."
1,Alarmingly Boring,"I've heard more soundtracks than albums of late and let me say that the Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind has quiet possibly the worst soundtrack I have ever heard.What the producers are trying to do is to capitalise on the effect the movie had on the audiences.with all due respects, I fail to get over the extreme monotony in sound this disc contains. Every song seems like the one you heard before. Because I love you (reader) , I dont want you to waste your money here. I recommend you buy some better scores instead (The village,Road To Perdition,Edward Scissorhands)The saving grace on this record is the Beck's "" Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometimes ""which quiet possibly is one of a kind. It doesnt belong to this record. Track 4 is when this album starts and Track 9 is when it ends for me. All other tracks on this record seek attention but fail miserably.I repeat. Please don't buy this record for the love of music.That's all. Cheers"
4,the open spaces of ESOTSM put the zap in my head,"I thought the movie, like the other 2 superb Charlie Kaufman works ADAPTATION & BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, was fantastic. The soundtrack brings back wonderful thoughts and memories of the film. This has a good balance between composed music and popular song."
2,Eternal Sunshina of the Spotless Mind,"This is a review on the CD from the movie. I was not really too fond of the music or the movie. I enjoy movie soundtracks, but this one was disappointing."
4,Strange...,"I LOVE the first song. Also the song by Beck is just beautiful. The rest of it, in my opinion, leaves much to be desired. But those two songs were enough to make me buy it and not regret it."
5,My favorite soundtrack,"I loved the movie this was made for beyond reason, so it is possible that my judgment is somewhat clouded, but nevertheless I believe it says something that this is the only soundtrack I will listen to over and over, for weeks at a time; and I have, since it came out. Having just listened to some clips of Jon Brions new solo album, Meaningless, I won't rave over how wonderful HE is, but this soundtrack, and the song ""Strings that tie to you,"" are wonderful."
4,Very good for only 14 places...,"This is a very good book to supplement other travel guides like Lets Go Europe or Lonely Planet. It is not good enought to be your only travel guide because it does not cover much acomodations or sights to visit. It also only covers 14 places and Ibiza and Pamplona are only covered superficially.Nevetheless, it is a great guide for those other 12 cities and it will make sure that you are where you should be in terms or partying."
2,ho-hum formula writing,"""Still of the Night"" is the first book by Meagan McKinney that I have read. In it I encountered a ""woman's blend"" of romance, mystery, and suspense that seemed initially engaging. There was also a big element of ""action/violence"" that seemed to have strayed from another genre.McKinney's Louisiana ""downhome"" sayings are fresh and unjaded, and her language escapes cliches. The love/sex scenes are well portrayed with the right touches of physical allure and emotional involvement.In spite of her deft phrases and skillful dialogue, I found ""Still of the Night"" too formulaic, as if conforming to a careful outline with a strange spin intended to appeal to women and men alike. From its promising opening pages, I expected another kind of book. I missed the integrity of a full-hearted, cleaner romantic novel it could have been."
5,Marvelous!,"This is the first book I have read by Meagan McKinney, and I have to tell you that it won't be the last! Suspenseful and just the right amount of romance for my taste. Stella de St. Vallier is the main character who lives at an old manor in Louisiana. She is entangled in many webs of intrigue, darkness, and disbelief. She is also searching for the 200 plus year old treasure that is supposedly hidden in her manor, Shadow Oaks. She lives with her great-aunt Rose and friend Leora, a.k.a. Maman. Just wait till you get to the end, you won't believe it!!! Don't miss this fantastic read!"
2,Disappointing,"I have read all of her books and found this one disappointing. The two main characters were interesting and well drawn but the villains were extreme and not believable. The ending was rushed and not really satisfying after all the build up. There were several areas given a lot of attention but then did not get wrapped up (e.g., her interest in period photography, the sheriff's twisted homelife). I have generally enjoyed her previous books and hope her future offerings will be better than this one."
1,BORING!,"This book was boring. What is meagan Mckinney doing, her older books, My Wicked Enchantress were good but these new ones are tiresome. I basically skimmed the entire book and the only reason why I didn't stop reading was to give her a chance.PLEASE try to write how you used to HISTORICAL romances with some degree of fun!After this book I may no longer buy."
3,No mystery No suspense,"I have read all of Meagan McKinney's books and while this book is an improvement over her last two novels, it just didn't keep me guessing. McKinney's period novels still remain her best work. Her latest venture into romantic suspense has been disappointing to say the least. I gave this book 3 stars because the character development was an improvement over her previous attempts. The ending of this book was my greatest disappointment. It was wraped up in less than two pages. It was almost if McKinney said to herself I don't want to work on this book anymore. I hope she will go back to what she knows best and forgets suspense because it just isn't there."
2,Brutal quality,"SCTV is awesome, a program I grew up watching. This DVD is poor quality however. The Queen Haters sketch has a line going through the top of the screen for most of the song...horrible."
2,Worst out of the 6 disk series,"I have the complete 6 disk set and when you get to this disk, in order, its like someone elsecreated it. Like what? The music, tone, one of the 4 eps is a haloween ep that justdosent go with the hole series. Another is the wild eagle and is just so completly differentthen the first 12 eps that you eject the disk to make sure you bought the right one. Vol 4in my opinion is not worth the price for what these people are trying to get for it and is the worst disk out of the 6. my (1-5) rating of each ep on this disk which there are 4.Ep 13 The brave wild eagle (1) Ep 14 Fright day the 13th (1) Ep 15 Laon returns (2)Ep 16 The red rival (5). Internet large place. Good Luck!P.S. Other reviews that gave this a (5star) no way did they watch, norhave this series. You have been WARNED!"
3,Informative but kinda cut and dry,It's a wonderful CD. Myabe if she had some soft music playing or something in the background so it's not just a voice. It was informative but cut andd dry. And I about fell asleep listening to the first 20 minutes. Which is unusual cause I really like Starhawk's writing I just think it's better on paper.
1,Too Expensive,Why is it that this book in hardcover is only $8.95 and the kindle version is $13.50? That's ridiculous!
1,Just an extended magazine article,"This book seemed quickly put together to exploit the explosion of interest in the Enron scandal. It's basically an overly long Texas Monthly article combined with the typical ""as told to"" book, where a writer-stenographer is fed information by the ""co-author"" subject."
1,Get out while the getting's good,"So little is devoted to Sherron Watkins's experience at Enron that I'm sure there must be better books about the energy giant's downfall.I expected to read about a woman making it in a hyper-charged, testosterone-driven environment, but the writers never deliver on it. The minutiae of contracts and deals are offered up but rarely is Watkins's involvement mentioned.This failure to address her part in the company, for good or ill, leaves me wondering if she simply didn't see the handwriting on the wall and write her infamous memo just to do a little CYA. There's also an unpleasant whiff of sour grapes - she never got the money she thought she deserved. If she had, would she have stayed silent?"
4,"Good book on Enron, but others are better","While this is a highly readable book on Enron and tells the story well, the Smartest Guys in the Room is more comprehensive and detailed and Conspiracy of Fools provides more insight into the individuals."
3,No Energy Here Either,"Disappointing. Although Watkins got a lot of play as a ""whistleblower,"" you may develop a different opinion if you read her actual memo. Nothing new, which is disappointing given her immunity from prosecution, and too long in coming. Technically proficient ghost writer."
1,This isn't really a product review... Price problem,"Kindle Edition -- $17.99 --Expand Hardcover -- $8.32 $0.01Paperback $19.46 $13.92 $0.13Audio, CD, Audiobook, Unabridged -- $14.50 $14.45Audible Audio Edition, Abridged $15.95Really? $17.99 for a kindle edition? Wow. I would have loved to read this."
5,Insightful,A good insight into what can go wrong in a seemingly perfect picture. Kindled interest into reading many of this kind of subjects.
4,worth reading,good account of what happened to enron but a little too wordy and technical at times . The last few chapters were the best.
2,Wu-Tang,"There is no doubt that the kung fu movies presented are classics. The cardboard box set actually got crushed in the mail so you can count on that unless your seller is really good about caring. There's a small interlude to every movie featuring all the dudes in Wu-Tang Clan before the movie starts and there's also music videos in the ""special features"" section. Not worth more than $20."
4,great book,This book has helped me through many situations. It has helped in becoming a better woman in all relationships. I recommend every young woman read this prior to becoming a mom or wife. I also recommend it for women who are already moms and wives and question the importance of their roles in the life of others.
4,In depth analysis,"Harry Jaffa's definitive work on the most famous debates in American history is necessary reading for anyone interested in Civil War history or, more specifically, the philosophical views that influenced the leading players on both sides leading up to it. The first half of the book is an in depth examination of Douglas's position on popular sovereignty and the spread of slavery. The second (and perhaps more interesting half) is devoted to the origin of Lincoln's ideas in the writing of the Declaration of Independence. Jaffa is a combative writer who is not afraid to criticize (sometimes harshly) the writings of prominent historians on this subject. However, though he clearly admires Lincoln's natural rights thinking and rejects Douglas's ""might makes right"" philosophy, he gives a fair analysis of both men's positions. As far as I know, this work remains the authority on this subject even after more than 4 decades in print."
5,Greatest Hits Johnny Rodriguez from Amazon.com,I love any song that Johnny Rodriguez sings . He is the music that I grew up listening to.I would like to have all of his cd's if I could afford them. I am very pleased with Amazon.com for all theirefficient and courteous help when I order from them.I am pleased with the time delivery.
3,Still waiting,I am still waiting on my first edition of the magazine to arrive. It has been 72 days since I ordered.
4,Great For Travelers And Locals Alike,"""Texas Highways"" is a great magazine for folks interested in the great state of Texas. It covers the state by regions, much like the Texas Tourism Board's travel brochure, and gives those familiar or unfamiliar with the Lone Star State a nice taste of things big and small that make Texas so unique. Recipes, travel tips, stories on locals and their haunts, music, and fun are all found here. They're all given to the reader in wonderful articles that capture this truly unique state.In case you're wondering, I'm not from Texas. I grew up in southwest Louisiana rather close to the Texas border. I love Louisiana like few others do. However, if I had to pick another state as a favorite, Texas would be at the top of the list. I'm an Astros fan, love the music of Gary P. Nunn, and will never turn down a taste of cold Lone Star beer. It's a great state folks, and this magazine catches its spirit exceptionally well."
4,I've subscribed for several years,I've found this magazine gives us inspiration on other places to visit here in Texas..even the ads have influenced us to check out some other cities/towns. It has beautiful pictures and well-written articles. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 (4.5 would probably be more accurate) is because I would like this magazine to highlight more places to eat.
5,A must have for SE MN & Western WI trout anglers,"I purchased this book last year as I started getting into fly fishing for trout and have found this book to be invaluable. The information provided in this little soft cover book helped me plan trips to new streams, and provided a nicer overview, map and history of some of the more popular streams. This book is a must read for any one new to trout fishing."
4,"""Raw meat for the faithful""","...now I can finally know what its like to be out in the audience at a live Killing Joke show...Nothing terribly new here musically,but its a great portrait of the band when they were at their 80's height(Night time era).I've never seen Jaz and the Joke live,so I wasn't sure what to expect,but they we're really good live..a nice tight set with a good overall representation of their discography up to that point..."
2,DARING DERON MC BEE,"Those of you who remember the early nineties tv show called AMERICAN GLADIATORS may recognize Deron McBee, one of its star performers. McBee, looking buffer than ever, plays a determined young man out to avenge the near-crippling of his uncle by a pair of Mexican drug lords. The movie's action sequences are borrowed from countless other films, and only the film's sincere attempt to take itself serious keeps it from being a true bomb. McBee has a tough swagger and is attempting to induce his audience to take him as a serious actor. Since McBee hasn't really done a whole lot since, guess the audience didn't see things his way though!"
5,sublime!!! a must have music,"WOW, this is very impresive what God can do with His power. Indeed. This CD has such sublime energy, I can assure you that you will feel the power of God`s words in this music. This is not a recital in Hebrew, let me explain it to you, the great people whom made this piece of heaven ""translated"" the 22 Hebrew into musical notes and made music with it. Marvelous!"
5,AWESOME COMPANY CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I can't say enough good things about the CD itself. It's exactly as described.However, Hebrew World exceeded my expectations. I received the CD very quickly, and found that they paid for speedier shipping so I would receive it faster.It's rare in these days to find a company that truly cares about their customers.Peggy"
5,"Hot, Country and Single CD",This is a great CD. Dean Dillon doesn't sing a bad song. He is so talented. I wish he would record more music. I am a die hard fan.
3,Not a movie! Episodes.,I bought this under the impression it was a movie. I already have the complete series and the episodes on this video are duplicates of the complete series. For the price of this video I ordered the complete series which is what I would recommend to others.
5,Wonderful Birding binocular,"I bought the Pentax 10x43 DCF ED binoculars as an upgrade/additional pair for bird watching. I've used a pair of 8x42 binoculars (that are not waterproof) for many years.I'm incredibly happy with the Pentax. After looking at a number of models, I chose the Pentax over a well known Austrian brand - I was prepared to pay twice as much as I did.The 10x43 DCF ED has great eye relief, a locking diopter adjustment, good rubber armoring, and are waterproof. What really helped seal the deal for me was the outstanding close focus and relative compactness of these binoculars. Twist-up eye cups and rubber removable objective lens covers are nice as well.Over all a very field-worthy pair of binoculars."
3,Atom Bomb,"Features a fair cover of Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky"" and a tepid version of Blind Faith's ""Presence of the Lord"" from 1969. Maybe I was expecting too much from the producers, but I thought that this song could/ should have been re-interpreted in a way that redefined the song for the 21st century. It doesn't even challenge the rather incendiary original version; and why redo a song if you don't even try to surpass the original? Taking the safe route results in a squandered opportunity."
5,Fifth Consecutive Grammy Winner Earns 5 Stars!,"The Blind Boys of Alabama are so much more than a gospel group, albeit they're undoubtedly the most successful such minstrels in history. This CD -- to my ears -- will win their fifth consecutive Grammy in 2005. That's quite a predicition for a March release, but you'll believe me when you listen.I particularly enjoy how they retool modern classics, illustrated here by Blind Faith's ""Presence Of The Lord"" or Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit In The Sky."" In each instance the Boys put their signature vocals and arrangements to good work, making them both standards and refreshingly new.Not a weak cut anywhere to be found. Solid commitment to the higher spirit that guides their lives consistently shines through.Can I get a witness? Lord-amighty, I say yeah! A-men brother, and count your blessings."
2,"Threatens, but fails to Explode","I have a fondness for Gospel music thought I don't have much experience listening to it. Still, I listened to this CD on a whim and found it adequate, but mostly uninspiring. The songs seemed like (are?) gospel standards and the Blind Boys showcased them with there unquestionably beautiful voices. But out of the ten songs that comprised the CD, I only really found myself connecting to track 2 ""Demons"" and track 9 ""Presence of the Lord"". The rest of the tracks were nice, which is to say mediocre. I may check the Blind Boys of Alabama out again, in hopes that maybe their other CDs have a more interesting selection of songs."
1,thousand reasons to stay away,Have you ever wanted to hear a male vocalist attempt to rip off Joni Mitchell while using songs with no substance and terrible production? Well this could be the album for you.
3,On This Album Yes He Could and Did,"If you ever listened to the Byrds Pre-Flyte album of demos that the Byrds made to get their original Columbia recording contract, you might remember a slow song by Crosby (one of his first recorded efforts) called ""The Airport Song.""On this album almost 30 years later the Croz returns to that lilting slow folk-melodic style. However, because 1000 Roads was recorded during the end of the synthesizer in pop music craze it has a lot of synthesizers backing him up. His voice actually changed little in 30 years.The songs are, as the reviewers below state, uneven. I agree that ""Old Soldier"" is a standout track and would have held its own on any Byrds or CSN album if Croz had back then been old and wise enough to write it.The title track Thousand Days is also excellent along with Hero and the second song about Croz racing cars as a kid.Croz's previous album Yes I Can was a disappointment, and it made me think No He Cannot. But on Thousand Days He Could and Did."
3,A patchy effort by a great artist!,I must admit that this CD has some stand out tracks and those few I listen to often. But overall this is a disappointing effort from one of the legends. I definitely expected much more!
2,Meh game,"If you like the classic Prince of Persia style games, you'll hate this one. If you like Warcraft Real Time Sim knockoffs, you might like this one. Can't blame the person who sold me this - I blame Ubisoft."
5,Fun movie,"This is about a group of jewel thieves who hide out at a prison, while at the same time a group of young film makers show up to film a documentary there. Little do they know the place is haunted, and the ghosts are rather bloodthirsty. Overall, I thought this was a really fun movie. The characters are excellent, with lots of personality and they're all quite likable. The action moves along at a fast pace and kept me interested. Lots of hot babes as well!For a low budget horror movie, this one is very entertaining and a lot of fun."
2,Big-House On Haunted Hill...,"A group of documentary film-makers venture into an abandoned prison, only to find themselves besieged by a group of desperate criminals. If that weren't bad enough, the place is haunted to boot! Yep, the ghosts of murdered inmates-past roam the halls, waiting for unsuspecting college kids and jewel thieves to mutilate. DEATH ROW is a goofy, rather dull spooker, with the typical victims and the ghouls who love them. Actually, there are some well-done gore fx, which are worth an extra star. However, I just didn't find this one to be all that chilling, original, or fun. The usually reliable Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) was pretty lame as the main badguy, the ghostly inmates look ridiculous for the most part, and the other characters are pure wood-products. The basic story is an ancient one that's been done a zillion times before in (better) films like HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, DEAD BIRDS, SCARECROWS, BELOW, etc., and didn't need another re-tread..."
3,"Yeah, it's okay if you're bored","Yes, it has a stupid premise. Yes, I wonder why the guard in the beginning chopped off his own legs to escape and not the hands of the guy holding him. Yes, the characters do nothing to endure themselves to the viewer. No, it's not terribly scary. But you know, if you're looking for something silly and entertaining (and gross), this isn't bad. The characters bicker but they don't all turn into jerks looking out for number one at the first sign of trouble. They (for the most part) attempt to stick together to try to all get out alive. The cinematography is good, the acting is decent, and the story (such as it is) moves along. If you can get it really cheap, I would recommend it."
1,not happy,"bought it for a 06 mazda 3,it said it fit, i emailed the seller to make sure, he said ""its a perfect fit for your car"" it came said for a mustang on the package, i returned it, about 27 days ago still no refund, never buying from this seller again, not happy and weres my money? don't buy from them"
5,Another great Eloise movie!`,"My 2-year old loves Eloise and her 6-year old sister has become enchanted by her as well. ""Santa"" brought this movie and the girls watched it the other day. They both thoroughly enjoyed it. My 2-year old doesn't normally sit through a movie but for Eloise she does every time!"
4,Great for girls,My 3 year old and I love to sit and watch Eloise she is funny and adventurous! Great movie little girls!!
4,The last great Boz album...,"David Foster really rescued this artist from oblivion when he produced MIDDLE MAN, a stylish, groovy and hook-laden rock n' roll-infused album that became the last great Boz Scaggs release. From the opening jazzy riff of ""Jo-Jo"" to the road-house blues of ""Breakdown"" to the inspirational balladry of ""Isn't It Time"", this album is ecclectic enough to appeal to many tastes while at the same time remaining true to well-crafted songwriting arrangements. It also features great solo guitar efforts courtesy of Steve Lukather. If you liked SILK DEGREES, this is your next best bet."
5,"William Royce ""Boz"" Scaggs' second megahit!","This great album features Top 20 hits such as JOJO and BREAKDOWN DEAD AHEAD. Boz Scaggs' first Top 10 album was 1976's SILK DEGREES. This album was released in March 1980 and while still on the pop/rock charts five months later,he had another hit song,the love ballad LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME from the URBAN COWBOY movie soundtrack. Around that same time,HITS! was released with a couple or three new tracks on it."
4,Better than silk degrees,The songs are fuller and have more substance. I think its better than silk degrees. It should have sold more.
3,"Decent material and workmanship, but smaller than other brands","I decided to buy this shirt because of the reviews that said the shirts run big, well that wasn't the case with the shirts I ordered. I bought 2 -XXL shirts, put them through normal wash, now too tight, too short. Had to give them away. After receiving these shirts I found another reviewer who ordered the XXL size, also said shirt was way small, said it would fit his son! Irony is, I gave these shirts to a woman at work, said they would fit her 18 yr. old son. Bottom-line, if you need a bigger size, I say stay away from this brand. Sizing was the only issue, otherwise the shirts seemed to be very nice."
2,Not that good,"I was dissapointed with the polos: they run HUGE (I'm 5'10"" and weight 198lbs, and the Medium fitted me a little big); the sleeves were extremely long (about 1"" below the elbows). The material is a little thin, and a bit cheap looking. I would recommend to spend a little more money and buy something that's worth it."
4,Too Small,"I ordered this shirt for my husband for his birthday. The texture is good. I read the reviews and went on what most of the men were saying about it being big. What is BIG! Well the XXL fits my son. He is not that big and the shirt was too small for my husband. We always buy XXXL, I guess no matter what, we will continue to do so. If you or your husband is Huskey, this is not the shirt to purchase."
4,Good Value,"Great color, good stitching, no issues when washed or dryed. Good value for the price, recommend buy."
2,"Thin material, sleeves not very long","I was fairly disappointed in this shirt. The sleeves run shorter than I prefer, plus it shrunk and did not hold up well after the first wash. The price is good, but you get what you pay for. I don't recommend this one."
2,"Yikes! This was so poorly written, it was unreadable!","I feel badly writing this because I think Jim Loehr is probably a very good coach and if he were my coach, I think I would get a lot out of his philosophy and strategy but trying to read his book was torture! My husband is an editor and we both agreed on this. It was truly unreadable. So much so, that I didn't really get anything out of it. Frankly, I didn't read much of it. I tried! I really did! Too bad. Maybe Jim should dictate to a writer what he wants to say, and have them word it, ie. a ghost writer type of thing."
1,Not great for stressed out people,"Don't listen to this book if you feel stressed out about work and hope to get inspiration and help to get on top of things. I did and I had to stop after only a few chapters since the author said that in order to get on top of things you need to push yourself further. Not a great start if directed to people who bought the book because they were struggling with stress. To the books defense, I did not listen to the entire book as it felt like one more demanding voice in my life. It may be a great help if you continue to listen/read the entire book and I know that others really like this book but I just could not keep on listening..."
3,Nuts,"The book is 50/50. 7 years old and showing its age. Lots of great advice, interspersed with lots of banality. Vast numbers of examples of people changing their ways in ways that stretch credulity. People's current systems have payoffs. The new systems have to match this situation and the authors don't address this important point. The guy who has a yummy fast food lunch who changes to salads and nuts is one example of this. As if. And most Americans hate exercise because they hate exercise. Try getting such a person involved in interval training and you might as well be barking at the moon. Immunity to Change by Kegan & Lahey shows why people don't change."
4,Great read. Very useful approach on change.,"Some of the anecdotes are skim-able, but over all a great read. It will put a gust of wind in your sails."
5,Life Balance for the Overworked,"A brilliant piece of work. This book describes concrete similarities in what it takes for a World Class Athlete, and an individual in the Corporate World, to excel. It explains how to go about building skills of recovery throughout ones workday, and throughout ones life, to maximize health, enjoyment, and performance. I enjoyed reading the stories of other folks, like myself, who felt squeezed with the endless demands of work and family. While logic says, 'run faster, run harder'; this book has a message which is counterintuitive. Stop, at regular intervals, to nurture, exercise, and free-up yourself. This will actually increase your levels of energy and short circuit the cycle of burnout. Rest and recovery creates fresh inspiration, fresh energy for creativity. Life balance is a process, and this book can be a great aid for those looking to create it."
4,Perform Like An Athlete,"Since we hear so much about the challenges of time management, I really enjoyed the ""paradigm"" of energy management. The authors' use of illustrations with professional athletes helped drive home the point about how business professionals can apply the same principles. While reading, I took the free energy management inventory and recommend that others do, too. I found taking the exercises at the end to be quite beneficial to my own discernment and definition of purpose. Make the time to read this book!"
3,More stories than structure,"The book started out very good, I thought it was a 5-star book. The introductory chapter defining the topic through a story worked fine, and the chapter on the importance of physical fitness for overall energy seemed extensively researched. But then the rest of the book was written without much attempt organize the content. Rather tens of different clients' cases were presented as separate stories, without much help as to how to apply it to your own case. I guess that the best I got from it was the idea of rituals."
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"The book utilizes a lot of ideas from a variety of sources---recommending good sleep hygeine, self-care rituals, good nutrition, CBT. One of the more interesting ideas was that people work best in ""intervals"" of intensity followed by recovery; I would have liked to see that idea explored more with examples. I couldn't help but feel that most of the ideas were recycled and repeated over and over again."
1,You don't need this book if you have any common sense!,"I bought this book in hope of learning something new. All positive reviews influenced my decision to give it a go. I completely agree with another reviewer who said this book is all about common sense. Basically, you have to use your energy and make sure you recover it, i.e. work and make sure you leave yourself some time to play. Add exercise and healthy eating to it and bingo, you've got the power of full engagement. In this book, you will find pages and pages of examples from research and psychology of sports performance backing the idea of work and play.Save yourself some time and money and just make sure you actually do it instead of reading this book. That's all there is to say."
2,"If you can get through this, you don't have a problem!","Maybe I just didn't give it enough of a chance or maybe my energy and attention level is so far out of whack that even this book couldn't help. However, this is such a dry read that IF you can get through this book....you don't need a book on energy, commitment and ""Full Engagement"". I almost thought it was going to have a big fold-out page at the end that said ""CONGRATS, YOU MADE IT THROUGH THE MOST BORING BOOK EVER. YOU ARE CURED!""Another major problem of this book is that it sites very specific examples which did not help me at all. I'm not a 9-5 Lawyer, I don't get lunch breaks and if you can explain to my 5 yr old that ""Daddy just needs more sleep in the morning!"" I'll buy YOUR book!Hey, if you are down in the dumps and need something to help you, then any port in a storm I say and good luck to you. This wasn't my cup of tea I guess."
3,Fine Book,The book provided some good ideas on managing energy as opposed to time. At the end of the book it provides a plan to help you implement. Overall it was an interesting read.
3,"Funny the ""gurus""just realized it; useful guide for most","For those that have practiced any sport, it is obvious that energy is what makes people succeed. However, based on my experience in corporate America, this book will be very useful for most, since it provides a nice well-balanced approach to managing the daily stresses of life. Regretably, most of the discourse focuses on common sense, and there are not many practical tips and suggestions fr putting the book's insights into practice."
3,"Too many ""case"" studies","While I liked the general premise of the book and bought into the concept of the importance of building in time for creating energy and recovery....I was fatigued by the volume of case studies, and individual stories some of which seemed a little contrived and simply self serving. Drawing the comparison of the corporate executive and the athlete was a great way to make their point. Loved their concept of energy management as opposed to time management. I just had to struggle to get through the many, many individual stories."
2,lots of fluff,"This is a book about managing and developing your energy and apply it to life and work. Every person has different biorhythms, and the concept is that to accomplish what you want, you need to train your body to maximize your energy when you need it, just as an athlete trains everyday to get the job done when it counts. The Power of Full Engagement was full of common sense and anecdotal stories of how other people 'trained' to manage their energy (fluff).There was nothing new in the book, if you have read other self-help or motivation books. I also felt like this book was written to promote the author's institute that trained several high-profile athletes too many times."
5,What really matters,"This book can truely transform your life. Schwartz and Loehr have done some amazing research and it all makes sense. I have spent the better part of my adult life in therapists offices and I can tell you that these guys have come up with a system that can truly get you where you want to go emotionally, psychologically and spiritually. This book is a must read for thoughtful people who are trying to engage their lives."
2,Authors seem to think they know more than they do.,"I found this book a waste of money. It's full of half truths asserted as fact. For example, the authors quote the old study that found that it matters what time of day you eat most of your food - morning or night. They don't quote the followup studies that find that after a few weeks the human body adapts and the differences no longer hold.Also I didn't like the emphasis on the ""corporate"" athlete. If all you want to do is adapt to a fast paced, stressful life, this book might help. But if you want to create a life more on your own terms, this isn't your best guide."
4,Lively written,"This book is great as a reference and as a source of important information concerning no frill airlines. The author's writing style is relaxed and lively. Whether you are just trying to kill some time by reading, or, you are a frequent flier, this is a great book for you. I learned a lot of useful information that I am planning on using whenever I travel again."
3,Sweet Water S/T '93 disc,"For those of you who were in Seattle back in the day (late '80's-to-early '90's)and who had been familiar with these cats from their SGM days (by the way, if anyone out there has a lead on their 1988 AGGRESSION indie release, please let me know), and had also rocked out to the '93 disc in its' previous incarnation on New Rage from 1992, this Atlantic release can only be considered a major disappointment. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, I seem to recall the band releasing this album on their own BEFORE the New Rage release of '92, and that rocked even harder than the versions from both New Rage '92 and Atlantic '93! Trust me, folks, the Atlantic release you've all been raving about is tame and watered-down compared to both of this album's 2 previous incarnations."
5,Met my expectation,"Completely met my expectation. I purchased these to give to my grandchildren for their personal ornament collections. They often give me nativities as I collect them, but I had never given one to them. I thought the simplicity was perfect."
3,Good hardware,"I bought this for the hardware, just needed a SDIO-footprint barcode scanner for my PocketPC. The included software is OK, helps you organize your movie and audio collections. The included barcode printer program is OK also, lets you print barcodes on regular printer labels.Unfortunately, the software installs as a trial version, activated using the code printed in the manual. The manual did not contain any unlock codes, and the product is discontinued by the manufacturer. The hardware is still supported, but not the software.As far as programability goes, the SDK is available from the manufacturer, but it's not cheap. www.opennetcf.org has a .NET component for the card in older versions."
4,very nice,Great CD. I am very glad I made the purchase. The last 5 songs on the CD are the best. I have played them over and over. Anyone that likes Buddha Bar music will like this CD as well.
3,Buddha Cafe OK,"To be sure, there are some excellent tracks on this CD collection, but overall i did find it a bit more ""clubby"" than expected. If you REALLY want to chill out and appreciate truly exceptional production, nothing i've found has topped Zero 7'sSimple Things. Or if you REALLY want the ultimate in relaxing chillout, check out some of Brian Eno's ambient collection such asAmbient 1: Music for AirportsorThursday Afternoon-- unique and groundbreaking stuff."
4,Bette Midler Strikes again,"I bought this cd in the bargain bin and what a steal it was. The songs small world and some people alone are worth the price of the cd. Small world is a beautiful duet with Bette Midler and the male singer on the cd. It is amazing. I love this song. It's great to be turned on to a new version of a gorgeous classic love song. I've played that song over and over and still love it. As for the rest of the cd, it sounds a little dated, but it's not bad...great if you like musicals. If you love heart-warming love songs, buy this at least for small world, you won't be sorry."
2,Falls Flat,"I just saw GYPSY and the well-known actress, Patti LuPone, playing and singing Mama Rose was superb. Her voice was a miracle of covering all the emotional turmoil that is Rose. She soared from sexy to demented to determined to clever.I came home and put on Midler's Gypsy, and it sounded flat, stale, weary, unprofitable. I have always liked Bette Midler, but this CD seems to have no dynamic, no sparkle. I think that you need a true Broadway diva to sing Rose, and perhaps even one with some operatic experience.I can only fervantly pray that the Ravinia Festival will release a DVD or a CD of the LuPone production.It may be unfair to compare Roses. Midler does excel in different material but I don't think that she was able to find the turmoil that is Madame Rose and to sing it."
5,Gypsy. 1993 TV version. CD,Gypsy was a popular stage show & vehicle for Ethel Merman and made into a film with Rosalind Russell & Natalie Wood as Gypsy Rose Lee or Louise Horvick. In 1993 a TV version was made with Bette Midler as Mama Rose at the same length as the original film release time. The soundtrack CD appears to be taken from the film's soundtrack with the incidental dialogue intact thru the songs. There are many hits from this show and overall the CD is pleasant listening and an added bonus to the DVD of the show.
2,Whole lot of filler,"Sorry Dennis I think your great but this collection is pretty weak. As far as all the allegations of plagiarism i could really car less. No cure for cancer was crazy funny. This follow up was just plain lazy. sadly it seems with most comics there is a big slump after there early material. George Carlin is the only guy i can think of that was consistently brilliant right up until his death. Anyway avoid this, even if you are a big Leary fan."
4,Attention Comedy Nerds,"Attention Comedy Nerds: The comparisons to Bill Hicks are ignorant of the facts. The bits and jokes collected on this disc are, as any comic would admit, of the kind that anybody would come up with. But to say it's a Bill Hicks ripoff? Where's that coming from? Bill Hicks started in the 70s and 80s in Texas. Denis Leary started in the 70s and 80s in Boston. To say this sounds like Bill Hicks is quite a compliment as Bill Hicks has become a forgotten icon of the late 1980s of standup comedy. But sure, most of these tracks are not unique jokes. Everybody had stuff about the war and drugs and women. Everybody still has stuff about the war and drugs and women. But unlike Bill Hicks's even paced delivery, you get classic Denis Leary: fast talking rants that can go on and on, never slowing down, makes you feel like you've just chain smoked your own pack and downed a few fifths when you're done."
1,No Cure For Bad Comedy,"I bought this album because of the track, A*#%ole, which still raises a smile, but only just. A couple of years after buying it, I discovered a comedian called Bill Hicks, and I am here to tell you, Hicks is the MAN! He is the greatest standup, funnier because his material is deeper than 95% of other comics (Woody Allen, Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor probably the exceptions). I don't want this to sound like an advertisement for Hicks, but if you're reading this and think Leary is great, Hicks will blow your mind; besides, the Gospel of Hicks needs to be spread. If you listen to No Cure For Cancer then listen to Hicks' 1989 album, Dangerous, you'll find many similarites. Even Bill knew that Leary had pillaged his material, and Bill had this to say of Leary: ""I stole his act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did."" ..."
1,Denis Leary rips off Bill Hicks,"Anyone who has listened to the great comedian Bill Hicks will recognize where Denis Leary gets all his best stuff. Leary was a ho-hum Boston journeyman until Hicks died & Leary appropriated all his stuff. Considering the title of this CD, it's ironic that Hicks died of Cancer. If there was a cure for cancer, Leary wouldn't have a career. A pox on this plagiarist. Point your Browser to the Bill Hicks section and get the real thing. I recommend ""Rant in E-Minor."""
1,No Cure For Theft,"Wow... That's all I can say after listening to this CD. This CD has so much stolen material on it, that I doubt that Leary even bought the clothes that he was wearing on the cover photo. Almost everything that you hear on this was done by Bill Hicks -a much smarter, more inventive, way funnier comedian. It isn't just that Leary stole the bits - he virtually lifts them word for word. He also stole from several comedians in the Boston area that were of that time (mid 1980s). Even his ending bit - about how we only kill the cute animals was stolen... I know - I was around then. In buying this CD, I just had to hear for myself. Sure enough, it was a tremendous disapointment to hear several comedian's routines being paraded before me. Honestly, save your money and buy any of Bill Hick's CD's. They are MUCH MUCH FUNNIER, and worth far more."
1,No cure for plagarism.,"This album has a lot of funny material. Unfortunately, it was originally written & performed by the late, great Bill Hicks. For proof, pick up Hicks' CDs - you'll find some jokes lifted word for word. And, Bill died (far too young) from cancer. Is Denis trying to confess his sins through the title of his show/CD? So, even though there are laughs to be had, I cannot support a comic who stole everything lock, stock, and barrel from a superior, deceased comedian."
2,No Cure for Cancer,"It is true that quite a bit of the material from this album resembles Bill Hicks's material from ""Dangerous"" and ""Relentless"". Leary even does a routine on Jim Fixx, a fixture of early Bill Hicks's routines. Most of his rants on music artists also sound very similar or almost exactly the same as Bill Hicks's routines.However, Denis Leary does have original material. Some of it is quite funny. And his song ""A-hole"" is pretty good too. Unfortunately, too much of this CD sounds like Bill Hicks to ignore. This would be a pretty good comedy CD if there was more original material. I would recommend to get any Bill Hick's CD instead of ""No Cure for Cancer""."
1,Fallen Idol,"I remember seeing 'No Cure For Cancer' on TV in the early 1990s, and being absolutely on the floor laughing. About a week back, after an interval of 14 years and having heard and LOVED Bill Hicks's routines since, I saw it again and barely raised a titter.Do read 'American Scream' (biography of Bill Hicks)to learn about a comic with REAL integrity who truly 'played from the heart', as he was so found of urging us all to do. Then see if Leary's erzatz imitation does much for you.And yes, it doesn't look too good that the end of Leary's stand-up career coincided with Hicks's death.I say this reluctantly because I have only looked into the matter recently, and have actually been a fan of Leary for 14 years, both as stand-up and actor - but once you check out Hicks's work and look into the facts, it's hard to have respect for Leary any more.The amazing thing is that he got away with it."
1,Why is Denis Leary bigger than Bill Hicks?,"Because there's no cure for cancer.The drug humor, the smoking, voice box, trachaeotomy, non-smokers die every day humor (Jim Fixx) right down to the rock bands-subliminal message (kill yourself, solution to the unemployment) jokes; Leary stole Hicks' bits in an act entitled ""No Cure for Cancer."" Meanwhile, the superior comic, Bill Hicks dies of cancer. It is sad that one of the best comics the world never knew is bigger in death than he was in life, while much of his publicity comes from the revealation that an overrated comic made his fortune ripping him off."
2,From hype to eternity,"It is good? I saw the NCFC tour live, and the CD was pretty much, spoken, word-for-word, without adlib or changes. My friend and I both love live comedy, and both of us were disappointed. The CD didn't live up to the hype. And the live show didn't live up to the CD.Leary makes stand-up into an ""act"", not an ""art."" For unsanitized (and funnier) recordings covering similar materials, you - as many here have said - want to check out Bill Hicks. Also try Doug Stanhope, though his free-form rant style won't be the same as Hicks. How about ('though he's a bit too smug to be funny for me) David Cross.BTW, Leary's ""re-invention"" as the star of a TV show is because he hooked up with the guy who did The Larry Sanders show. He may be criticized for being derivative, but the guy's not dumb. He knows who to hook up with - and later steal from."
3,Has not held up over the years.,"There were some good laughs on this cd. But his over the top manic delivery was too much for me and the jokes seemed stale these days. I know that this album is a favorite among many, but I am not one of those"
2,Save your money,"The first time I saw Denis Leary I thought he was amusing, not phenomenal. Then I discovered the work of Bill Hicks. It's hard to doubt that Leary grafted a lot of ideas from Hicks into his own routine. (If you have seen Leary's material from the late 80's before MTV picked him up, you can see a 'before' picture of Leary limping through his performances.) Some of his material *is* funny, but it doesn't tend to hold the complexity that makes me wish for repeated listenings. My recommendation is to pick this title up used if you really want it. A better recommendation is to listen to Bill Hicks."
1,BILL HICKS KARAOKE BY DENIS LEARY,"Denis leary is an absoulute thief!For anyone out there who have been blessed with the comedy of Bill Hicks you will know exactly what I mean.Denis Leary has made a living by stealing word for word idea for idea in most cases the work of a far greater comedian.Leary does not have a talented bone in his body, oh except for when he is doing his MILLER commercials. Get the f*&% off the artisitc roll call you no talent cracker.If you wantt o hear Denis leary dooing bill hicks then by this.BUt if you want to hear the real thing and better times 1 million then please by BILL HICKS, your life will change for the better. I promise you that.And as the great man would once say ""CASE F%&^$N CLOSED"""
1,Dennis Leary has a career because there's no cure for cancer...,"When I bought this album years ago I would have given it 5 stars, because I laughed my a## off.Then yesterday I picked up ""Relentless"" by Bill Hicks, and I am furious. Huge portions of Leary's cd are ripped off almost word-for-word from Bill Hicks' material. I had heard the rumors that there were some similarities, but I liked Dennis Leary, and I didn't want to believe it. Now I wish I'd never bought No Cure for Cancer and contributed money in his direction.If James Frey can be brow-beaten on national tv for making up elements of his memoir ""A Million Little Pieces"", Dennis Leary should have gotten similar treatment YEARS ago for being a dirty stinking thief.Listen to the two comics side-by-side and its undeniable. The only reason Leary got away with it is that Bill Hicks died in 1994 of (how ironic!) CANCER.Shameless."
1,No Cure for Bad Comedy,"If you want to hear every joke Denis Leary ever ripped off from Bill Hicks conveniently packaged into a single show, buy this now."
1,Stolen Act,"This Entire CD & HBO special is stolen material. All this material was originally written & performed by Bill Hicks. Buy Hicks DVD ""Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian"" if you want the material in its true formhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0004Z33FK/qid=1130712550/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-5459925-2315938?v=glance&s;=dvdBill Hicks was also paid tribute on TooL's Aenima album."
1,Joke Thief,Denis Leary's whole act is stolen from Bill Hicks nearly word for word. Save your money and search Amazon for Bill Hicks.
5,"3 letters: capital N, small y, BIG F**KIN' Q","Easily the better of Leary's two offerings, this album shines for its eight minute rant about drugs. More to the point, two minutes about NyQuil make this worth buying. While some of the material will seem dated, it's all funny. The only bad points are ""Traditional Irish Folk Song"" and the fact that some damn funny stuff got omitted. Buy the CD, then watch the video, then down some NyQuil, and listen when the big f**kin' Q talks to you dammit!"
5,The Best Ever,"Dennis Leary just HAS to be the funniest comedian alive. Next to the late Sam Kinison, Dennis Leary has all the right lines. This has got to be one of the funniest comedy albums I've ever heard. If you don't already own this one, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!!"
2,"First half great, second half abominable","The graphical quality and level design VANISH in the last 2 levels. Also, the final level is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to beat--with horrible long times between checkpoints. I play shooting games A LOT and i cannot fathom anyone beating this game on normal difficulty: if anyone does it is pure luck of not being in the line of fire. Graphics are ps1 quality in the last (VERY LONG) level."
4,Diet Airbourne,"This game is very good at letting me down. Yes, you can parachute out of planes in about two missions. No new weapons, but the weapon upgrades you can find are nice, but how can this game come out in 2007 and not have online multiplayer. So do yourself a favor and just get Medal of Honor Airbourne or better yet just wait for the Newwest Medal of Honor game brilliantly named: Medal of Honor due out fall of 2010."
4,could be worst but in the end is a hell of fun!!!!,"This game is short, its had 5 or 6 levels but dont get me wrong, short dont means easy, the last two levels are a pain in the back, but you realize that the more advance through the game the graphic became better and better, and one point the graphic areequal or similar to the game BLACK, with great outdoors and ray of sunlight across the ceiling.My favorite mission was the one with te parachutte landing and conquer the shore full of germans with 50mm machine guns. the more task that you complete you gain medals. I recomend this game for you!!!!!."
3,good game,"this is a fun game overall the 10 short levels you play throughout it...Game is not worth the buy because barely any levels. I beat it in 2 hours and returned it and i think the psx version is better and funner because ive played it too. The game is fun but the levels are to short and nonrealistic, ex. when you get shot while playing this game the screen turns red...wala, after 2 seconds your health regains...So don't buy this piece of crap"
2,wait for xbox 360 airborne!!,this is a thrown together game.easy to beat on best setting.not very difficult.save your money.buy it used.
3,why do we have to title reviews?,Vangaurd is a solid game. the only thing is your team mates get in your and stop your shooting and the graphics are great but sometimes they look a little choppy. the multiplayer is really good although there aren't that many maps and weapons. i would definatlly recommend this game.
3,A decent game,"I love the Medal of Honor series, and generally the games are great. I have to admit, it seems like EA games is getting tired of its prodigy. The game has some fun game play, and has some nice added features. I've always wanted to know why a soldier in combat wouldn't run a lot more. Finally it's in this game. You can run! Also, you can peer around objects to shoot or throw grenades. Finally you don't have to expose your characters body to take a shot. The music is rehashed from earlier games and there is no story. I played right through this game on normal difficulty without any problems. The ""Sniper"" level at the end was the hardest level. On two levels you parachute into combat, and that's kind of cool, but your landing area is quite confined."
2,They phoned it in...,"FROM BUTTERCUP'S HUBBY: This game is very disappointing. I have bought all of the Medal of Honor games and each has been better than the last---until this one. They are just trying to extend the brand while they work on the PS3 and Xbox games. No new weapons, no new scenarios, not very challenging, very average. Rent it, don't buy it. There is a reason why this game is opening at $39 bucks when all of the others started at $49---it's Rocky V."
1,not worth the time,This game is not worth the cost of buying nor the time to play. Disappointment is not a strong enough term to describe this game.
1,Plastic Junk,"The clip arrived in a plastic bag, not normal packaging, and as I pressed the two buttons to see how it worked, the top popped off, and the whole thing fell apart. A total of 30 seconds after I opened the shipping envelope. It looked like the top two mounting posts were never glued, and the bottom two posts just snapped off. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. The Krussell All Metal Clips are much better. (Though out of stock by all vendors on Amazon.) The silver lining of this whole purchase was the Seller, GPSCheap. They were prompt and courteous and had taken care of the issue right away. Very good customer service, very poor product..."
5,The Best Electronic Device Clip I have used,"This is the best Clip I have ever used, and I have tried many. The round piece that attaches to the device works best if you can attach it with the screw in the middle (I haven't tried to use it with an adhesive/"
1,Dissapointment and saddness.,"I am very disapointed. I ordered this for a lightsaber holder. After I put my saber in a few times, it fell apart. It should not have done that. Also it came in a little plastic bag, and not a plastic bubble case. Also it was all black, with no white. I am forced to keep this because I have no money to send it back and no way to currently do so. I am very sad and dissapointed and say you should not buy this. If there quality control is that bad, then why bother buying."
2,Not for real Jomada fans!,"I'm guessing the record company forced them to make this set. It's a true disservice when artists step away from the genre that people love them for just for the sake of ""crossing over"". This album is full of uninspired generic R&B tunes. The only real standout is ""I Cried The Tears"". I wasted my money this and I don't recommend it."
5,An Eclectic Mix of Styles,If it is energy and master musicianship that you require in your music then truly OSB is the band for you. The vibes that the band emits makes one want to dance. From your traditional understanding of jazz (that is improvisation see... Grant Green) to funk that the JBs bring the energizing cuts that combine the powerful workings of the Hammond and guitar OSB brings true musical happiness.
1,where's my order?,I ordered this product in January. It is now the middle of March and after being told it would ship in March I am now being told it will not ship until the end of May? I just canceled the order. Why should I have to wait 5 months for a coffee mug?
2,"Interesting songs, voice very flat","The song construction and lyrics are the best part of this CD. The vocals, I am sorry to say, are the least complimentary. Knight's voice is flat and at times harsh. I have listened to the CD several times in order to try to change my mind but have not. In my opinion, it would definitely be better as an instrumental CD. There is a lot of other goddess/pagan music I would recommend before this CD. Sorry!"
5,worth buying,"I bought this CD without ever hearing it. I'm glad I did. At first I didnt like it because it didnt feel very ""paganish"" to me, but after listening to the words I realized that this CD is indeed very pagan and very fun to listen and dance to. Black Jack Davy is my favorite song on here, it will make you want to dance and sing along. To all you pagans out there, I would definatly recommend this CD. The only thing I dont like about Sharon Knight is that she has a bit of a lisp, and its hard to ignore that when listening to the songs."
5,We LOVE Pocoyo,"My children adore this cartoon. We first saw it in England while visiting friends. I'm so excited it is coming to the U.S. now!! Its very well done, computer animation, involves the adventures of a little boy named Pocoyo (age 4)and his friends, Pato the duck and Ellie the Elephant. Its all about friendship and discovery. Even my 8 year old adores it but it is really age appropriate for 2-4 year olds. I am very excited to show this cartoon to my preschoolers! Its funny, entertaining while touching on core values of friendship."
5,"Funny, but not obnoxious","Its so hard to find TV for a 2-year old that is not too flashy, loud, etc. My wife and I monitor our son's TV viewing carefully after reading many articles regarding its affect on toddler's attention spans. Pocoyo is funny and entertaining without being obnoxious and without being too ""flashy"". Shows that are all ""zoom, pan, move around, shout"" are not good for toddlers. Shows that are TOO quiet are boring and do not entertain them. Pocoyo is a great example of a show that gets it right."
5,My 18-month-olds LOVE Pocoyo!,"We received this DVD for Christmas when our twins were 11.5 months old. We would put it on occasionally and they seemed mildly interested, but weren't really that into TV/DVDs yet at that age other than Baby Einstein. Our boys just recently (at 18 months) started saying ""Pocoyo!"" and now that they can say it, I realize how much they love it; they ask for ""Pocoyo!"" all the time! This series is VERY charming, simple, and seems to be good for language development. Love the British accents, too. :)"
2,Me and My Brother,These guys are a dirty south crunk trio and this is there third album some of the stuff I heard was wack and some was good.I have heard about 5 songs off this album but there probally the Top 5 Songs well any way here it goes.Lyrics 4/10 Production 3/10 X Factor 7/10 Classic 3/10 Me 6/10Overall-23/50 wich is good for 2 Mics try again please
1,"""These are our heros?""",Why supports these sambos? I guess it's fine with everyone that these 2 young black men make a living by cooning for the American Public. Pure IGNORANCE.
5,i recorded this like haaaaaaaaaaaaahn!!!!!!!!!!!!,"yo who ever makes fun of ur voice? why u gotta diss da ying tang twins? i think the ying yang twins are awesome and if u dont then ur retarded and gey. if you dont like me then lick my 9 sucka!!! anyway my favorite artists has always been the ying yang twins and it should be yours too. i can do the impression of kane and u better do it now f***er .shove this up your blunt and smoke sucka, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahn!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,More BS,"THese brothers obviously don't know the concept behind the ying yang and the I-Ching philosophy. Because they have produced a modern day shuffering and smiling step and fetch it cd. That noise the tall dude makes is too annoying, you know when he opens his mouth wide with all that ugly gold and says ""aaaaannnnn"". That gets on my last nerve."
5,Killer Cd!,"This cd is awesome! Every song on it is great! A lot of people are on this, i love the cd, i can't stop listening to it! If you like the ying yang twins, make sure to get this cd! It's awesome!"
3,"""Salt Shaker""","I think this cd is straight. The only song that I can listen to without getting tired off is ""Salt Shaker."" It's another hit like ""Get Low."" Yeah, there lyrics aren't the best ever, but they do have some tight beats and that's what makes the song. ""Naggin"" was straight also but there beats once again made it even better."
5,Hilarious!!!!!,"I am giving this CD five stars because I am rating it as a comedy album. Its a joke, right? I mean these guys can not be serious. ""If you don't give a f**k , put your middle fingers up."" Hahaha, thats funny because its a joke album because nobody is that stupid and unoriginal to seriously use that as a chorus. ""Me and my brother, stay crunk like no other, stay high as a motherf**ker, stay drunk as a motherf**ker,"" brilliant! Rhyming the same words together, thats genius. And they do it a lot on this album. If you want a good laugh, I suggest you pick this up."
3,Pretty Good,A very good cd I especially like Salt Shaker & Me & My brother..I was so surprise & how good it was
5,This is the Best Ying Yang Twins CD Yet!,"You can listen to this CD the whole way through, it's that good!!!"
3,Ehh...back to the drawing Board,"Yes, I have the CD and it isn't what I had expected. The only good songs that will possibly catch your ear is Naggin, Naggin Part II, salt Shaker, Hanh!, and Georgia Dome. other than that, the rest are kind of lame. I recommend that you just ask a friend to lend it to you or burn it. Or if you love Ying Yang so much, go ahead and buy it, but don't waste your money!"
2,ME & MY BROTHER,"Ying Yang Twins are back with their 3rd disc, Me & My Brother. While still staying with the ""crunk"" music scene, they branch out al little with their track ""Naggin'"". But besides that, this is yet another hopeless attempt from YY. The ""Georgia Dome"" and ""Salt Shaker"" tracks are performed with Lil' Jon & The East Sie Boyz makin it even harder to like this album.""Crunk"" music has gone downhill from Bonecrusha to Lil' Jon, this whole era is gone.If you really wanna get ""crunk"", tho, try out LJ&TESB's latest EP Part II, which features up to 3 rmx's of ""Get Low""."
4,Ying Yang Still Crunk,"Yes there back, with there gold teeth.In this album they prove there right up there in Hardcore Rap and they prove this in the songs Naggin What The F**k,Saltshaker,them braves and georgia dome excellent sequel to smash hit by lil jon and eastside boys GET LOW. The lyrics they used are incredible but some songs are weak and lazy.Ying Yang include Lil Jon and Eastside boys,Trick Daddy,Bonecrusher and Killer Mike to produce even more heavy Crunk.The Twins use solid different types of Hardcore Rap to make their album sales very productive. It is a very excellent album that I think all Hardcore Rap fans should get. If a few songs were a bit better it would definately be a five star album.YING YANG STILL CRUNK!!!!!!!! so go get their album ME & MY BROTHER"
1,Yang gives Ying a woopin' it won't soon forget...,"A lot of people hate the rap today, DESPISE the rap of today, and with the Ying Yang Twins in the mix, who can blame them? With an irrepressible bark, these two southern lightweight try to weigh in against the likes of Outkast. Ludacris, and David Banner and surprisingly to the fact they are far inferior, they squeeze in there. First off this album, was ""Naggin'"" which was a nag to hear, then was ""Salt Shaker"" which squishes and farts along.If their lyrics were good, I'd be willing to overlook the fact of their lackluster beats. ""Five dollars get your ass a table dance, If you got ten then bring a friend"" and ""Drankin everyday like gasoline in the car, you can find me at the bar"" they bark, Ludacris would laugh in their faces at lines like this.The twins need to learn to pro-nun-ci-ate things and quit with the throwback (or should I say throwaway) beats."
1,this is terrible,what is wrong with you people?! it sounds like some idiot trying to sing deathmetal vocals with rap. i dont like rap to begin with but now i hate the crap.all of you other idiots could you a spell check with your damn ebonics. THIS SUCKS!!!!!AHH!
2,pretty average,"I mainly got this set for ""Naggin"" which is one of My Cuts at the moment but on a whole I wasn't really feeling this set.the styling of rapping on this set is cool for a few songs but it doesn't change&I Lose interest after a while.but I give them Props for ""Naggin"" but the Answer back is corny."
2,"come on,wise up folks","when will the ying yang twins disappear??? its bound to happen soon.i mean the bookmakers wouldnt have given them a chance after ""whistle while you twurk"",but they're still here!!! that in its self gives them an extra star.but i take a star away because they worked with britney ""hymen"" speared.but a star on for working with fruit loop little jonny boy.so on that sound basis i award this album 2 out of 5.ive heard all of it,honest..........."
1,I'm Shakin it ova here boss!,"This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in ""black face"" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL."
3,Just Basic Lil Dog,This dog is just a simple toy but my twin boys do enjoy it. I had to buy this one because i couldnt find the Chicco family of barking dogs. Still looking for a more sophisticated barking dog that lights up. Recommended but there are better puul dogs out there.
4,Old Fashioned Fun,"I love this toy BECAUSE its mechanical, not electronic. I hate all the lound battery powered ""Learning"" toys. This toy will not contribute to the pollution from millions of toys with multiple batteries required, PLUS our 12 month old daughter loves it and has been able to identify dogs and what the doggy says since opening it on Christmas day. We Love it!"
3,Not Impressed,"My grandparents got this for my daughter's first Christmas (10 months). I immediately cut the string off because one of her favorite things to do is to take anything that's long and thin and put it around her neck like a scarf (after seeing Mommy and Daddy put on a scarf every morning).The only thing this puppy does in terms of noise is it makes a squeeking noise when it's pushed (or pulled). This is probably one of her least played with toys. While it's cute, it just isn't overly interactive."
3,ok,"it was okay, kinda cute, ours did break after awhile, but then my kids play rough with things. Not sure if I would buy again???"
3,Pull a puppy toy okay,"This toy does make a noise and has fun movement, but my daughters weren't all that interested in it. The fun of pulling the dog only lasts for a few minutes."
2,A ho-hum toy,I bought this toy for my 1yr old granddaughter. The box says dog will make woofing noise when pulled and wag tail. It is very light weight so it quickly tips over. My granddaughter enjoyed dragging it around on it's side and it made the adults laugh. But it definitely does not make any barking sounds just an annoying cranking noise. The tail is loose but doesn't wag. I wish Fisher Price still made the wooden dog pull toy that my son had in the 80's. I noticed most plastic pull toys won't stand up bc of the lightweight. I thought the packaging description was deceiving and I returned this item.
2,for me....thumbs down,"This is a cute toy however, my children lost interest after about a month. Also, the ""leash"" should be about 6 inches longer for comfort of your little one and it would make it easier to pull. I would not recommend this toy."
1,A Waste.,"This toy is nothing spectacular. I got it when my 14-month-old because he was just starting to walk and he loves puppies. However, he's not too interested in this toy. When you pull it around (or push it) the dog makes a little squeak. It doesn't sound anything like a woof, bark, or any other kind of dog noise. My son is now 16-months-old and he walks really well, but he's still not interested in this toy. A few times I've seen him try to play with it, but he just lifts the ""leash"" up and ends up carrying the dog around... instead of ""walking"" the dog. It's kinda cute, but not really ""fun"" or ""entertaining""."
5,Children love too explore...,My daughter didn't know what too think at first but when I showed her a few times she got the hang of it. It is cute to see your infant for the first time learn something that you have shown them. It was worth every penny.
4,cute toy,This toy is cute and my kids love to play with it and pull it around but get very bored with it fast.But it is very durable.
2,not great,"i bought this as a christmas toy for my 11mo old son. he loves pulling/dragging stuff around the house and i had this puppy as a child so i was very excited about it. i also love toys that dont require batteries. when pulling this puppy he tips over all the time and the ""barking"" noise is more like a mouse squeek. my son doesnt really like it."
4,It isn't great.. but it's worth it.,"While this isn't any bells and whistle toy the kids like it, it isn't annoying and loud. It works much better on hardwood then it does carpet. Entertains my 18 month old all the way up to my 4 year old. Worth the small price."
4,Fun toy,My 2 year old loves this toy. I haven't had the problems with it tipping over like the other reviews have said.
1,Completely Useless,"I bought this for my nieces and it was a complete waste of money. If you are an adult and can pull and walk smoothly, then it's great, but no toddler can pull it smoothly while walking at the same time. The toy immediately tips over and my nieces are instead dragging it across my hardwood floors, which a) upsets my nieces because they want to walk a dog the way grown ups do and are smart enough to know you don't just drag your dog along the sidewalk and b)it scratches my nice hardwood floors. We instead gave it to our 6 month old son, because at his age all he wants to do is bang things with his hands repeatedly. So it's about as functional as a plastic bucket but way more expensive."
3,Wrong voice box?,"I have to wonder if Fisher-Price inadvertently switched the voice boxes for their choo-choo train and this little puppy. Instead of producing an ""arf-arf,"" the best it can do is a ""putt-putt."" If you pull it in reverse--about as challenging for a tot as teaching a dog to walk backwards--the sound is altered in favor of a somewhat more ""arfish"" quality. The ears and tail move because they're loosely attached, not because of gears or mechanical coordination.Anyway, my grand-daughter enjoyed pulling it (on its side) for a least a good five minutes, so it probably passes the most important reviewer's test."
2,Not as good as 'Sing Along Lil' Snoopy',"The only sound this dog makes is an anemic arf while the wheels are turning. It does not bark like a dog or bark the B-I-N-G-O song like 'Sing Along Lil' Snoopy'. I was hoping to get another Sing Along dog so my twins wouldn't fight over our one, but I was disappointed."
1,not what I ordered,"Just as I had read in past reviews... I didn't receive the brown dog that was pictured (I see that now they added a note about not guaranteeing the color). I even called Amazon prior to my purchase and was told that all colors are lumped into one SKU #, however, I should receive what is pictured (brown dog). I decided to take a chance and received a white dog, which we already own. The only easy part was returning it..."
1,Disappointed,i just received this item and its not even what is pictured!! I looked every where for this brown puppy & in stores then only have the white so when i found this for my sons birthday i was so excited. i opened the package and there inside was the white puppy... false pictures (it should say white one or something)! if i decide to still give this to my son i will write a review on how good of a toy it is but right now I'm very disappointed and want to make sure other people know that this item came as the white puppy not the puppy that is shown
4,"Maybe it's just me, but...","My review may be tainted by fond college memories, but I always thought Mr. Happy was one of those college bands that should have gone on to bigger things. Great band, great music, and some serious funk in the bass!The big missing item on this album is Scott's rocking cover of Let It Be."
5,5 stars to offset the other dumb review,"What I liked about this book is that it divides jewish food by nation, starting off with jewish food in Isreal, then moving through other middle east countries, Eastern Europe, Germany/Austria, France/italy, Spain/Portugal and rest of the world. Within each region the recipes are grounped according to lunches, dinners or special occassions (eg sabbath). At 218 pages there is an abundance of recipes and all the usual suspects can be found. Overall a huge representation of jewish food and a very nice book."
5,Just what my trip to Europe needed!,"I just got back from a semester abroad in Florence, Italy, and I was so glad I brought this book. It had great suggestions of all types of places to go out at night. The best part was that it gave a list of the ""Hotspots"" for every night of the week. This was helpful because it automatically clued you in on what places would be packed that night, even if you didn't know a single person in the city. If you plan on partying in Europe, this guide will tell you everything you could ever wish to know."
2,Very few cities listed in this book,"The book has detailed information for Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Capri, Florence, Ibiza, London, Madrid, Munich, Pamplona & the Running of the Bulls, Paris, The Rivieras, Rome, Venice but that is it. If you are going to alot of these places, this book will probably benefit you, but this is my third trip to Europe and I'm going to different cities not listed in this book, so it's completely not helpful. It's also kind of hard to follow and understand, picking 4 different types of travelers that you have to relate to, and not one of us on our trip did... Like I said, if you are going to many of these cities, it may be useful, but I highly recommend Let's Go Europe 2007. It was actually cheaper, includes every one of countries in Europe and I have yet to find a city it doesn't cover with very detailed info. and just as much or more of the party information found in Party Europe, written much better and easier to understand."
3,How to take the long route and still not get there.,"BABY OF THE FAMILY read like two seperate novels, and that was a problem for me. The first few chapters dealt with Lena's sixth sense and I was captivated. Then, the book shifted into a coming of age story that took up the majority of the novel. Lena's powers were not addressed anymore until the last three chapters, and by then, I didn't care anymore. Had the novel stayed true to the plot, I am sure it would have been a great read, but because it deviated and didn't jump back on track until the end, the entire novel was a let down."
2,This book is extremely disappointing,The story is not very interesting. The book has too much discription of the furniture in the house and not enough of a story line. I wanted to read more about ghosts and Lena's supernatural powers. This is a typical coming of age story with one or two ghost stories thrown in. I was truly disappointed.
5,Da Bomb!,This book was excellent! Very deep and detailed. I love the way the author talks about the relationship of the whole family. Many people expected this to be more sci-fi than fiction...I think this had the right combo of both. A must read for anyone.
1,CONFUSION!!,My mother got me books every Christmas when I was growing up to encourage me to read more. She got me this novel 1 year because of the title (I'm the baby of our family) but I just didn't get it? The story was just odd but to each its own.
3,Sweet and Boring!,"Overall the book was sweet. The most interesting thing about this book was the mystery of the veil over Lena's face at birth. After forcing myself to read the book one summer, I delivered a beautiful baby girl who was born with a caul. And I thought it was just something from Ansa's imagination. The story was long and intriguing events were told with no real excitement."
4,Not as hard as his earlier stuff...,Why Moon is not a house hold name surprises me but there are other artist's out there in the same boat.This album has different version's of his earlier releases these version's seem to be a little mellower but there pretty good there seem's to be some new material here that I have not heard from M.M.just a solid well enough done effort.....J.B.
5,Small but effective,We didn't buy this toy for our kid to play with so the review is mainly on the product durability. We purchased this for some maternity photos and these blocks are perfect for that. The yellow color is pretty hard to see because it is so bright but the colors did not effect me too much since I will be changing their colors in post anyway. They are a nice small size that make it easy to stack and even better for photos.
4,abc blocks,a little smaller than i expectedhowever a good size for his little hands and big enough not to fit in his mouthcareful where you step though
2,"Well, it's OK",Turns out this isn't really what I wanted but what I wanted cotst like $400 so this will do!
5,Much better than theatrical release,The extra content in the directors cut makes this a much better film. I felt like I was watching a new movie.
3,"Hot, Sexy, Fun","This is the 3rd title in the HotWires series. EJ, the confirmed playboy of the previous 2 books, is investigating a totally sexy woman, Charlotte, who runs SexyTarot.com. However, several of her clients have been robbed and EJ thinks Charlotte is behind it. Not all is as it seems, and Charlotte needs help when a client comes to collect. Can EJ trust her as Charlotte trusts her cards that EJ is the one who can help?"
2,For the young at heart,"It's a nice watch, but way too young for my taste. I was looking for a large face watch and this one did fit the bill. However, I didn't like the wrist band. I gave this to a younger friend...who loved it!"
5,This album rocks,Excellent jams. If you like to rock out this is where it's at. I recommend this album if you like that sort of thing.
3,Dropped black from color plates,"I have all the books in this series (four to date) plus a few others by H&C. I have to agree with Christopher. This installment seems to have some printing problems. But in my book, its only two pages (pages 14 and 15) that the black plate didn't print, giving the uniform plates on those pages large areas of a pale bluish gray where the black should have been. This might not seem that major since only two pages are affected, but since the plates are one of the stronger reasons why I collect the books, this is actually a big deal to me. For the price we pay, and the the fact that these books are of very nice quality, you would think that they would proof the printed material looking for mistakes before and during printing. My reason for the 3star rating for this book. The other books get 5stars for color plates."
2,Printing Messed up on Color plates.,One of the benefits of this series is the beautiful coloruniform plates. Unfornately in this book they are reallymessed up. This book should have never reached the marketplaceis this condition!!!
1,Just did not keep me wanting more,Okay- I loved several of his other CD's but I could not relate with this one.None of the songs stood on their own feet. I just felt it was put together to try and relate with his very young fans.I disliked the Duo with Uncle Kracker- the cross over into Rock is making him less of a Country Artist. It is either one or the other.Sorry Kenny this one I am selling on Ebay cause once was enough to listen to it.
2,If it ain't broke - don't fix it! - This CD lacks the spark.,"Chesney takes a different direction with this CD and simply put - &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;... this album lacks direction and the music (relative to his talent), gets about a &quot;C&quot; grade. What originally drew me to Kenny's music was the combination of Rock and Country. This CD lacks the spark. The songs are average at best. I'm a huge Kenny Chesney fan... and for the most part, I think his music is top-notch. I hope his next CD to this one will return to his what he truly excels at - a country/rock artist."
5,I would Give This CD 10 Stars If I could!! Must Have!,"I have to say, I searched for a month before this CD came out to get a pre-sale on it. Ever since the first single &amp;quot;There Goes My Life&amp;quot; came out, I have been wanting to get a copy as soon as I could. I knew from that song on that is was going to be a great CD. The Duet with Uncle Kracker, just takes you away to another place to be carefree just like &amp;quot;No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems&amp;quot;. I have been to the islands and I am planning another trip as soon as possible thanks to Kenny, Unlce Kracker and this song. This new CD is absolutely amazing. Another fine product from a country music artist who just never stops amazing me by how much better he gets with every CD. You will not reget buying this CD. Target and Amazon provide great service when it came time to pre-order this CD. I had it the next day. Hope all of you enjoy it as much as I am!!!"
5,Kenny rocks my socks!!,"I have been awaiting the release of this CD since the ""There goes my life"" single was released months ago!!! It was so worth the wait. ""When I think about Leaving,"" ""I go Back,"" and ""some people change"" are awesome tracks. The title song duet with Uncle Kracker leaves something to be desired though."
5,His Best Yet,"I love this CD. ""When The Sun Goes Down"" makes you think of summer, and Kenny and Uncle Kracker sound great together. ""Some People Change"", ""When I Think About Leaving"", and ""When The Sun Goes Down"" are my favorites. Usually I don't like live songs, but ""Please Come To Boston"" is the best live song I've heard. A must-have for every Kenny fan!"
2,It is going to Burn the Billboards!,"Yikes, this CD is absolutely awesome. I like it even better than the last album. Songs that EVERYONE can relate too. The duet with U. Kracker is really good."
3,Disappointed with When the Sun Goes Down,"I was really looking foward to the release of this CD as, overall, I am a huge Kenny Chesney fan. I used to faithfully go to his concerts when he was still touring on small, local venues of a few hundred people. (My husband and I even played Kenny Chesney's Me and You as our wedding song.) However, after listening to the CD only three days, I am ready to take it out of the CD player. None of the songs ""grabbed"" me. It leaves me wondering what happened to the Kenny Chesney that I used to so enjoy."
1,HORRIBLE STUFF!,"I'm sick of these ""hot hunks in hats"" acts doing what they think is country music. It may not be their fault, though. Its the producers and the promoters and the marketing ploys. It works though becaue the looks sell. The music is not proof of that. As a matter of fact, some of the messages in these songs are downright immoral!"
2,CD purchase review,"I received this CD, and case, as damaged. I did send an email requesting assistance in this matter, but as of Sept. 13, 2005 have had no response from company. This will probably be the last time I will order anything online. Thank you."
4,"Bought it for the audio, not the visual... Great Music","I have to say i didnt know much about Kenny Chesney, to the point of not even knowing what songs were played on the radio, or who sang 'em.So I found out who sang ""that song"" on the radio.. (asked the wife).. My response was ""thats Kenny Chesney???""... I hadnt expected him to be that good. When I went to buy the CD, I realized why most of his fans are women. The CD is like a Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. This was rather sad.Chesney shouldnt be marketed as some sort of Frat Model. It does him a disservice to allow his handlers to do so. I dont buy A&F; catalogs because I feel they are only marketing skin and hormones. Not clothes. Thus the Chesney CD printed booklet seems to be doing the same.That being said, the man has an amazing voice, and the music and arranging is phenomenal. I have no qualms with this CD. It is everything I would have expected and more!"
4,this cd rocks,"At first I didn't know if I was going to like the cd. My friend just started getting me into country. But I'm sure glad this was my first one. The songs have an upbeat tone to them. I love the song 'Keg in the Closet' it is just about having fun with friends and loved ones, which anyone can relate to. Another good song is 'There Goes My Life' at first the song is about this guy losing his dreams because his girlfriend got pregnant, but then the daughter grows up, and she's moving away, and his attitude is at a whole new prespective. Which is really moving."
5,Kenny Chesney ROCKS!!!!,I just saw Kenny Chesney last night. He totally ROCKS. He is just fantastic and so is this CD. This is one of those CDs that takes awhile to grow on you - but when you really LISTEN to the words... and then when you know what heartfelt emotion went in to writing these songs you really get a whole new perspective. Kenny Chesney has come a LONG way in all of the years that I have listened to him (about 4 now) and he ranks right up there with the best of them. His concert was sold out last night - and I could have sat there another 2 hours! I think that one of my favorite songs on this cd has to be Please Come to Boston (bonus track) and The Woman with you. I love Kenny and his Jimmy Buffetishness - he's GREAT with his toes in the sand and a drink in his hand. He makes you WANT to slow down and enjoy life.Get this CD - you will not be disappointed.
5,AMAZING!!!,"Only one word comes to mind when describing the latest edition to Kenny's collection: AMAZING!!!! Every track on this CD is good... I immeadiatly popped it into the CD player when I got home and from the first moment I was impressed. From the alredy gone #1 ""There goes my life"" down to the 3 bonus tracks at the end of the cd... it's fabulous! You WILL NOT be dissapointed!!"
1,How Could Anyone Like This?,"I just don't understand how anybody can enjoy this childish predictable music. I mean all of his last ""hit"" songs are all about the same things. And that is about growing up. I mean come on now think of a new subject already. It almost seems like he just keeps changing the lyrics ever so slightly in all of the songs. They almost always have lines about being young, your first kiss, or something generic. The words are just so plain and nondescript, just like the music. I just feel like this guy is one of the most boring looking unoriginal performers of all time."
1,H O R R I B L E,"I love Kenny's music but this cd really does nothing for me. His new music is all starting to sound very similar to the songs he's recorded in the past. The title should be ""when kenny goes down."""
2,Baldy's most boring release to date,"I have really enjoyed Kenny Chesney's last couple of regular efforts (not the Christmas dud) but this cd is a big disappointment. Baldy has never sounded so bored and disinterested throughout. And what's with collaborating with that no talent Uncle Kracker? Uncle Kracker may find Baldy's tractor sexy, but they need to keep their musical careers separate."
4,Good CD,"This is a good CD. I love the song ""There Goes My Life"". It is worth buying the CD for, and there are quite a few worthwile others as well."
5,A must for any Country Music fan,"I originally purchased this CD for 1 song ""Anything But Mine"". It turned out to be one of my favorites. Contains many hit songs on the radio today. Definately a MUST HAVE!"
1,Not very good,"Almost every song can be described as either: 1) Jimmy Buffet wanna-be, or 2) Kenny singing about losing his virginity in high school.Tired and boring."
2,Exactly what's wrong with country music today,"You have a talented guy like this, he comes out with a new cd that's basically a rehash of his last cd and it sells like hot cakes. What has happened to the country music industry? Everything sounds the same as if it was made from a cookie cutter and there's not a real stand out in the bunch. I bought this cd for the stellar track ""There Goes My Life"" but goes down hill from there. The duet with Uncle Kracker is catchy, but at best, it sounds more like a knock off of the Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett duet of ""It's Five O'clock Somewhere"". Hopefully Kenny will have a better album next time. I really do like his music and I own all of his releases, but I think he should have spent more time finding material for this outing. Instead of spending your hard earned money on this disc go get the new release by Clint Black or Gary Allen instead, much better material and you'll have a disc that will get repeat listenings."
4,Good for what it is,"This is a fun cd. Everybody who is crying about no substance or no real good writing on this cd is missing the point. Its not supposed to be some deep, sad country cd. This is the cd you'll want in your cd player at the beach this summer. Its a fun, layed back cd with very little attempt to be anything more. By the way even the songs that are a little more heavy are better than 90% of what's out there right now. So when this cd is the playing at every beach-side bar this summer maybe some of you will come around."
4,Kenny Chesney Doesn't Disappoint,"I have been adding to my Kenny Chesney library of CD's. When the Sun Goes Down is typical of the wonderful music, lyrics and general every day warmth that permeates all of Chesney's music. You won't be disappointed."
2,New Songs?????,"I found this CD to be basically the same as No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problems. The songs sound the same, and feel the same. At first I thought I had accidently put in No shirt, No Shoes, but it was just that the two CDs are that much alike. I like kenny chesney and his philosophy and reasoning behind what the songs mean, but he needs to mix it up a little (or a lot). Honestly because his last two CDs are so simular this one bored me. Coming from an artist of his caliber it was a major disappointment."
5,Very Different,"I like this cd, a lot. It is a lot different from 'traditional' country, which is a movement I never really understood. I have listened to country all my life, and can definitely say that Chesney, who I have listened to since his first CD waaayy back when, is as country as the last cd I bought before this one, a Hank Williams Greatest Hits album.In conclusion: Everything a country album should be. I laughed, I sang along at the top of my voice, I lived a lot of those songs myself, and I definitely cried. Who says this ain't country? No rock or pop album's ever made me do all of that."
5,I LOVE KENNETH ARNOLD CHESNEY!!!!,"this is a great cd and recommend it to anyone and everyone! all of his albums are terriffic. but if you want up to date, this is the only cd for you! i promise. his new one comes out january 25th 2004. so keep your eyes open for more kenny. it is supposed to be songs he wrote on his bus as he toured. so very heartfelt. but till then....buy when the sun goes down. you WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!! keep my word on that one!"
2,I need to know the meaning of a certain song.,"I have a question to all of you out there on Amazon, especially you Kenny Chesney lovers. Exactly what do the lyrics to his song ""Anything But Mine"" mean? I was confused by looking at the video and by listening to the song. Please help me."
2,"doll funny looking, not for play, dogs are really cute","We bought 2 birthstone barbies. Their faces are kind of funny looking, the eyes are big and look left, the lips are too big. BUT the big thing is their knees don't bend, all they do is pose. The hair is styled funny. Big hard curls in front, but flattened in the back, kind of like someone combed the curls out. Also, lots of static-hair floats up and sticks out. Tons worse than ""regular"" barbies. However, the doggies are really cute. But $15 for a tiny toy doggie is extreme. Buy a different doll and get the dogs somewhere else"
2,shipping problem,"quality of tool is as advertised. ordered 12-29-09. did not recieve until 1-19-10. Ordered collet extension at the same time-been over a month, and still have not recieved it."
5,Williams at the Top of His Form!,"Hi classical guitar fans. This is the first time I've decided to write a few words for Amazon. This recording has moved me to add a few words to the roster.I would like to convey something that perhaps is missing from the other commentary. This album rises above the usual ""good recording"", by Mr. Williams. We have here a CD that is the rare combination of all the right elements that combine to make it into the most hoped for ""favorite record"" status.It is that good! I sensed it right away when I played it for the first time through. Every song is a gem, perfectly played and follows in the 'right' order. The producers have very cleverly managed to time the space between the tracks to be very minute, and so the music flows wonderfully from one song to the next.Both my mother and father are in love with this CD as much as I am! They play it over and over. My mother (who is 70) counts it as one of her favorite recordings of all time.Folks, this is truly a winner."
5,UNIQUE!,"beautiful sound!... great cd!Im Venezuelan, and its not easy to find our music only played in one instrument (guitar)great choice of songs, played beautifully! you can feel the emotion and passion.."
3,An oversized board book with nice drawings,"But I think it would have been enough for each animal mother to simply explain (in author Tafuri's sweet, organic way) why she loves her baby. It seems less necessary to reinforce the anxiety--fans of the book would term it curiosity--of those baby animals as they ask again and again, ""Do you love me?"" My concern is that children will assume they, too, must continually ask this of their parents, when in fact it should be hard-wired and understood at the most basic level.This is an unusual board book. It is both large format (7 by 6 inches) and also quite long (30 pages). The drawings of the animals and nature are finely rendered, not so much for the humans at the very end.Ultimately, I preferGuess How Much I Love You, though that is not without its detractors, either."
5,A simple tale of love and affection.,This bunny board book provides a simple story of animal affection as it tells of various animals who ask love of their parents and receive fine comparisons in return. A simple tale of love and affection evolves.
1,"Should a child ask a mother, ""Do you love me?""","This book had great potential from looking at the title, but as I read it, I was greatly disturbed. On every other page in the book, the baby animal says, ""Mama, do you love me?"" The mother then assures the baby animal it is loved. ...But my concern is that children should not even THINK to ask this question, and I feel that this book might encourage a child to wonder (or worry) about whether or not his/her mother loves him/her. I do not recommend this book at all!"
2,Just another one of the same old thing,"This is that seen if all before kind of thing where a guy falls in love with someone, but is tempted by someone else, he's not sure what to do about it, so naturally they hit to road to go play beer pong and party along the way, get drunk, fall apart, and recoup by the end to celebrate there understanding of themselves. YAWNNNNNNN however watching this after Van Wilder 3, it seemed like a watchable movie. Just don't expect anything memorable that makes it stand out from the 100 other of these kind of films being dumped out of hollyweeds rear end every year."
5,Uptown Music for Downtown Kids,Uptown Music for Downtown Kids is an excellent CD. I love every song on it and I cannot stop listening.
3,Battle-Bots...not so much,"I bought this for my ten year old and both he and his older brother 12 were totally psyched about the concept but it has been three weeks now and noone is playing the game. Seemed like a great thing to all of us, but ...eh. They can't say what is wrong with it, it is ok, just not what they hoped it would be."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!,"This robot game is the worst gameboy game that I have ever had!!!The controls are bad:L=R, R=L, U=D, D=U, plus if you put them into reverse, nothing changes.The problem about ""design"" and destroy is that you choose from 3 of 4 different weapons, a chaisis, armour, tires, and an engine. In other words, you don't really DESIGN anything.Scale 1-10Graphics=7Phisics=2AI Aggression=4Controls=0Entertainment=1Overall Rating=4"

1,HORRIBLY LIMITED GAME,Horrible game. Limited options. Predictable and boring opponents. I literally finished the entire game within an hour. No replayability factor. Avoid at all cost!
1,Cannot save the games,"Do yourself a favor and save yourself the grief of purchasing this game. The instructions do not match the menus, there is a confusing ""password"" area that is apparently useless for actually doing anything, there is no ""save"" or ""load"" game option even though the instructions imply you can do this. So each time you start up the game, you're starting from scratch. The instructions imply you can load games, but this is not possible because there is no menu option for doing this.Need support? Just call the manufacturer's 1-900 (pay-per-minute) number listed in the instructions. That's not ""support"" in my book - and I don't buy software from a company that produces buggy software, then won't support its product without charging a fee.We are returning our game to the store; do yourself a favor and don't purchase it in the first place!"
3,WHY DISCONTINUE PLAY STATION VERSION??,"My son is a great fan of battle bots and wants as much engineer games that you can create, build and play! There is NOT enough of these games available for our left brained, intelligent engineering children! Any suggestions for these types of minds please forward! I will get the play station version, however, we now have Gameboy SP; will this meet our needs or our expectations?? I don't know! Why outdate something that could do well, if given the right promotion and advertising to this age group!! I will check back for suggestions!"
1,WORST GAME EVER,"OK THIS GAME STINKS OK IT REALY REALY SUCKS SO DONT BUY ITI GOT THIS GAME AND ON THE WAY HOME IT WAS THE WORST GAME EVERAND I HATE THIS GAME DONT WAST YOUR MONEY OR TIME, BUY THE GAME NEAD 4 SPEED UNDER GROND! buy that game not this one!!!!"
3,So cute - make sure it fits your crib,"My crib has a wide band at the top - the way that this product is designed, I couldn't attach it to the crib.It does come with wall mounting instructions, if that's what you'd like."
3,Good for showing your team spirit but not much else,My husband is a big cowboys fan so this seemed like a great idea for our little boy. First we tried to put it on the crib and it doesn't fit so we had to mount it on the wall (which has worked out fine) My only big complaint is that it really only plays for about 7 or 8 seconds after you wind it. The baby likes the music for the few seconds it's on but you could develop carpel tunnel winding the thing if you actually wanted to get it to play for a few minutes.
2,Ok...,"The mobile is ok (at best). You definitely have to have the right crib for it to fit. We had to tie it on with matching fabric b/c it wouldn't fit around the rail. Also, the arm is white plastic. Hopefully you like the look of plastic put together looking like a puzzle...it's definitely not high quality...but if you're a big enough fan, you'll stick with it for fear of being a ""fair weather fan""!!!!"
1,Sports Team Crib Mobile MN Vikings,"I bought this for my daughter and husband's first baby, a boy. They are avid Vikings fans, but when they opened it up, the football which hangs in the center of the mobile was missing, very disappointed! The football was a major figure in this mobile too. I'm not sure if I'll order another. It was very cute, but a major part missing!"
2,Not worth the money,"I was very dissapointed in this product and returned it. It is flimsy and if a decently sized child ever actually got ahold of it while it was attached it would probably break right off. The stuffed toys were all slightly ""off"" looking and were not of a very good quality, and if I had screwed the attachment on firm enough to actually keep it upright it would have chewed the finish right off the crib (as it is it left a mark I had to paint over). If you HAVE to have your team, it's really the only thing out there on the market, be prepared it is NOT worth it unless you are die hard and don't care about the quality."
2,Looks really cool,"The item is as advertised and is really cool looking, the issue is that when you wind it up it only operates for about 3 minutes, not even close to enough time to put my boy to sleep. I am going to try to find a cheap mobile and harvest the rotator part and replace the one that came with the mobile."
1,Poor quality float,"I purchased an AirTex E7094M fuel pump. It had similar issues. It was due to the float being made from 2 pieces of thin brittle plastic, poorly seamed together, and hollow. The seam developed a crack in an inside corner after the 1 yr warranty, which allowed gasoline to fill inside the float, making the float not float on top anymore. The float, now at the same density of the gasoline would find random spots to sink or float to, giving erroneous levels. What is worse, AirTex refused to send, or offer to sell, a replacement float. They just wanted me to purchase an entire fuel pump, whereas the float could easily be swapped out and it was a cheap hollow part."
4,Who would have thought?,"Who would have thought this would turn out to be one of the most fun games I have played recently. I picked it up the other day because it was cheap. I was very surprised and have to agree with the other reviews I have read. It was a sleeper. It has a great story line, blood and gore, and plenty of bad guys to blow away. It could be compared to Soldier of Fortune for the PC as body parts get blown off of the bad guys when you shoot them. It is a great game, but don't let the young ones see it as it contains very harsh language and extreme violence. Should be rated R.Graphics: 4 out of 5.Control: Pretty easy to get used to.Overall: Great unexpected shooter with the ability to interact with the environment to include flipping over items to make cover from enemy fire. I wasn't able to find any faults. Definitely a must have for any FPS fan."
4,An Entertaining Game,"I have played the first few levels of Cold Winter. It has good graphics, good gameplay and controls, and the level design is fairly creative. I like the action in this game, you really feel like you have to get something done -- complete your mission! And don't get killed! This is not the best shoot-em-up I've ever played but it certainly is entertaining."
1,What are these guys smoking?!?!?,"I don't know who wrote these 4-star reviews for this game (maybe the developers moms), but this is the worst shooter I've ever played on PS2. Luckily, I have a monthly rental pass at Blockbuster, so it really didn't cost me anything to try this game out. And that's good, because I wouldn't pay $1 for this game. It is that bad! The graphics, gameplay, story - everything - this game looks like a Beta test game, not like a finished product. Save your money and time and stay away from this one."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Over all a good idea, and was nice for awhile if only the keys werent total crap (paper thin), I only adjusted the hitch 3 times before I bent 2 keys and then the 3rd broke off inside. Bottom line the keys make the hitch worthless."
5,The good stuff just keeps coming!,"Well, I have been a big fan of Paul Owens' previous book and DVD, and this latest DVD proves that the good stuff keeps coming. I found this DVD to be incredibly helpful in approaching many of the behavior problems that I found was happening in my home. I felt that each solution was broken down into approachable steps so that I was able to accomplish what I saw on the screen.I give this DVD a double thumbs up and would recommend it to any of my friends."
4,the Original Dog Whisperer,I almost missed buying this because at first glance I thought it was a Caesar Millan video and I just can't/don't want to implement his techniques! I find Paul Owen's non-violent and gentle approach compatable with my personality and belief system and much more effective with training my new puppy and with correcting some problem behaviors with my elderly dog. This is a comprehensive video set. I purchased the clicker also. I recommend it.
2,Not What I Expected.,"Like the ideas Paul has, but I was expecting that when it said ""safety on walks"" to get some tips on walking dogs and correcting common problems. This doesn't really help with that...and I'm irritated that I now own the online version of the video. At least I didn't buy the actual DVD..."
3,NOT The Dog Whisperer that I expected.......,"The title is misleading with all the press and TV time that Cesar Millan, I expected it to be him."
1,"""Original"" but Shabby","I did not see the ""Original"" inserted in the title of this video and assumed I was buying a Cesar Milan video. I was not. Production quality is extremely poor, shot in the guy's living room with bad lighting and tattered furniture. Thinking he may have useful training techniques even if it is essentially a home video, I watched and did not find anything helpful. This was wasted money but an important learning experience. I will be far more careful from now on."
2,Not up to her Dance with me,"I thought this would be another heartbreaker of a CD.After all, Dance with me was hard to beat. Probably one of the best CDs of all time.Well, this was quite disappointing.There is one cut however which is fantatic. FLOATING.Almost worth buying the CD.So, if you really want her voice, buy the DANCE WITH ME cd.I just can't say enough about that album. It is infectious."
2,Disappointed!,"I appreciate the idea of having a healthy organic snack to offer my family, but clearly this is not the mouthwatering, melt-in-your-mouth kind of popcorn that one would expect. This stuff is so bad (tough and hard to chew!); nobody in my family will eat it. I tried eating some, and with every mouthful I was spitting hulls in the trash. I discarded more than I swallowed. I would recommend that this popcorn be taken off the market, as it is not fit for human consumption. It seems more like the type that should be fed to farm animals or maybe used for Christmas tree decorations. I often buy organic products and have found that, many times, the taste and quality is not as good as it should be. I would not recommend this product."
5,Poppin Good,"This popcorn is very good. There is no gooey fake oil butter substance that holds the kernals together, just kernals in the typical bag. It pops easily with the microwaves popcorn button. It will be dry healthy popcorn when it is complete. It is your job to add the not so healthy stuff, but at least you know what you are putting on it."
5,The popcorn I was looking for!,"This is great unadulterated microwave popcorn. This product just does not seem to be available at retail outlets. Even places like Trader Joe's sell only popcorn with various oils, salts or butter flavors added. Oils used, even in brands like Paul Newman's, are palm or cottonseed oils, best to avoid. If you like just plain popcorn as a fiber treat or prefer to add your own flavorings, this is the one to buy."
5,"Simple, real taste of unadorned popcorn","Most people will find popcorn without salt or oil to be uninteresting, because they are used to it having lots of flavor added. But I actually prefer the taste of this popcorn. For me the trick is to leave it in the microwave an extra 45 seconds, so that the popcorn is nice and crispy."
3,GOOD but there are better-tasting alternatives (and just as healthy),"This product is good, but tastes rather bland. I reviewed the label and compared it to other brands. Here are some alternative:- Orville Redenbacher's ""Light Natural"" has fewer calories, the same amount of fat, better flavoring (palm oil), larger bags (3.3 vs 2.8 oz), and costs approximately half as much since Redenbacher frequently goes on sale. The only drawback is more sodium, but IMHO the ""light natural"" variety is still a more attractive choice.- Healthy Choice Popcorn is another alternative with many of the same benefits (and drawbacks) listed above, although I don't think it tastes as good as Redenbacher's ""Light Natural"" brand.I won't be buying anymore of Bearito's, not because there's anything wrong with it, but just because there are better-tasting options that are just as healthy. :-)"
4,90s jam band at its best,"Helluva live set from a group that came and went with too little fanfare. Band that came from the same scene as Blues Traveler and the HORDE festival, but these guys had more of an Allmans feel.After two decent studio songs, this album goes through seven live songs, most of which are brilliant jams. Wave On and Eeagh the Jester Cried are up there with anything. The guitarist and piano player rip it up every chance they get. Songs that didn't get boring after NUMEROUS listens.Highly recommended. 4 1/2 stars really."
3,Not That Great,"I don't like this album. The vocals Flat-Out Suck. The guitars on the other hand are WONDERFUL!!!! The guitars just shred man!!! I f you Can Somehow block out the vocals on this cd and just listen to the guitars, it would get 5 stars. Get Trivium:Ascendancy, Soilwork: Stabbing the Drama and Unearth: The Oncoming Storm. Now THATS real metal."
5,My review for .... The War Within,"This album is the latest that I bought. I wouldn't dish it because its actually quite acceptably produced. Being a die hard MM fan, the fastness of it gives some headaches at times, but isn't that what METAL IS ALL ABOUT !!!!! \M/ \M/. The solos are so good on this album. I got the bonus dvd and enhanced version. The best song is What Drives the Weak. His voice [Brian Fair] is sorta like Corey of Slipknot. He fades in and out of singign and screaming. This is a must have."
3,half-assed... but not bad,"Am I the only one who bought this album and is a little dissapointed? The Art of Balance blew me away with it's originality and energy. The War Within seemed to fall short of my expectations. First, there is a lot more melodic singing. Not that this is a bad thing, but it doesnt seem to mix well in this album. Another big thing I noticed was that in nearly every song on the album, a riff from the art of balance in present. Whether it is the exact riff or a variation, it makes the entire song sound similar to some of their previously released songs. Also, it seems like the structure of the songs as well as the whole album follow the same flow as the art of balance. I must admit that there are some high points in the album, but it in no way matches their previous release. Still check it out, but don't expect anything new or ground-breaking."
2,"Oh my god, THIS is the standard?","Are you kidding me? -""The standard by which all other metalcore will be judged""-? I read this in a magazine review. It's hilarious how much this album wants to be ""Master of Puppets"". I wont say its a complete failure, i liked the songs ""enlightened by the cold"" and ""what drives the weak"", but COME ON! This fits in nice and snug into an already overstuffed genre lacking creative thought and originalty. How bout some breakdowns other than chugga-chuggas,and god if I hear another single note run harmonized in thirds i will shoot myself. This is another band that you can have thier entire song catalog figured out by the first two tracks. I love metal/metalcore, and it pains me to see buzz around something, then to be terribly disappointed when i hear it."
2,I don't get it,"Well, I had heard all kinds of good reviews of this band and this album. Even MetalJudgment.com gave it an average of 4.67 out of five, and those guys are usually right on the money. I have to say I just don't get it. They sound a lot like Killswitch Engage, but just not as good, and I'm not the biggest KE fan, so that is not saying a lot. The songs are all just OK, not one song really got my attention and I felt no urge to bang my head along to a single song. The songs are just not that heavy or catchy or anything. Just boring and uninspired. Save your money and go buy some Opeth, or Lamb of God or Pig Destroyer or Arch Enemy or Nevermore, or 50 other good bands. I just don't get the hype. Mediocre at best people!"
3,Not Their Best Work,"The War Within, though probably being Shadows Fall's best-selling album is not their best work. It is good, but could have been a lot better. These guys are very talented musically, alot more so than other new metal bands. I prefer their two previous efforts, Of One Blood and The Art of Balance, to this one. Those albums are heavier and rock harder, this one is more commercial. If you dont believe me, check out songs like ""What Drives the Weak."" This album is still good, better than many other recent metal releases and worth listening to."
4,"Decent, But Nothing Special","This definetely isn't 2004's best metal release. It isn't lousy, though. The vocals are alright, but are nothing special. The guitars are good. This album has some incredible guitar solos on it. The bass is nice, as well. Some songs tend to be a bit boring, though. And this album doesn't really have an aggressive feel to it, like most metal albums do. There is definetely some good stuff on this CD though. See if you can't find a used copy of it some where. It isn't bad. But to be honest, nothing on this CD really stands out."
4,Pleasing to the Ears!,"Shadows Fall is an amazing band with a lot of talent and it is displayed here again with The War Within. This album is much more melodic then their last one The Art of Balance which is my favorite by Shadows Fall. Like that album here again we see great drumming, excellent guitar solos and great vocals leading the charge. Great songs from this one are: The Light that Blinds, What Drives the Weak, The Power of I and I and The Ghosts of Past Failures. However I only gave this CD 4 stars because this album is missing the energy and intensity of their last album, I found I did not have the urge to bang my head like I did with the last one. Some of the melodies here seem a bit forced and do not flow very well with the rest of the song. In spite of this thougth it is still a very talented, well put together CD and should do any metalhead proud."
3,Bleh...,"I'm not into it and I've tried to listen to it many times and can't get it. The vocals are the only thing that steer me away from it. He can wail and scream (I'm not feeling that junk either...I can scream too pal). I'm very impressed with the guitars and the rest of the band putting it all together quite nicely however 3 stars at best. Quit screaming bud, I'm right here. He's not really on key when he tries to belt out a few conservative notes either and that's just not good when you're recording, can't imagine those songs live. Might be for you, but not for me. Trivium has a better feel to it I think. Where has Metal gone too? It's depressing if you ask me. Maybe that's why all of the hair bands are starting to brew some music up again, they're tired of listen to it oo I guess. I say we need to take a step back and regroup, metal has lost it's originality I couldn't tell one screamer from the next."
3,Different than most of the bands they're compared to,"....OK. Im trying to be HELPFUL. This band will probably not break into many metalheads' rotations. My biggest problem is the singer. The band is clearly talented, but the songs all sound antiseptic or something - not much feeling. I've bought about 25 metal albums this year and this is the only one I just look at and always say ""nah"".My problem with the singer: He sounds a little hickish. I don't mean to be prejudiced. Pantera were self proclaimed hicks and I prefer Phils 90's vocals over all others. But I really think that this singer just sounds different than most of the good metal out there in a less appealing way.Just to let you know where I'm coming from, my faves are: poison the well, in flames, killswitch (w/ jesse more than howard), trivium, unearth and a good deal of more mainstream metal. So if that sounds like the top of your record collection you probably won't love this band."
2,Very Overated Band...,"I bought this album a few months ago because I heard that Shadows Fall were really good, and where else to start but with their brand new cd? What can I say, this album really bores the hell out of me. The songs are so drawn out, it's like listening to the same song twice for most tracks, some being uninteresting the first time around. The guitars are pretty good, but I think the vocals are really poor. He tries to sing on a few tracks but it comes off weak, and his regular aggressive vocals are nothing special anyway.I'm sorry guys, I do not see what is so special about this band. If you are looking for new metal bands I would personally check out All That Remains, Trivium, and Unearth. Those bands all really impressed me with their last releases, which Shadows Fall failed to do."
2,Shadows Suck,"This album is pretty weak to sum it all up...yes, the guitarists are incredibly talented, which is why it got two stars. But just because you have awesome talent doesnt mean any album you throw together is worth buying. This really doen't have too much emotion or direction put into it, i mean really, its just pretty much stupid riffs and brian's trademark annoying vocals. dont waste money man"
2,"The talent is there, the music isn't.","I got turned on to Shadows Fall when The Art Of Balance came out. It was a great album, no doubt. I picked up The War Within, well these guys can play there positions very well, everyone is talented in the band. It's just this album sounds to similiar song after song. Telling songs apart becomes harder after each song. But that is really to say about all the new wave of american metal bands, (Lamb Of God, Unearth, Killswitch Engage..etc.) Shadows Fall sticks to the same format every song pretty much, with an occasionally melody. I would probably enjoyed this album more if I heard it before The Art Of Balance, probably. It had a bit more diversity. But that aside, if you like Lamb of God or Slayer, you'll dig this, if you want some diversity of get something else, cause it isn't here."
1,"Yes......the album of the future, NOT....... typical metal","All metal from american bands in the last 5 years have sucked, sounded the exact same, and has gone no where.This album is no different. Just buy any Disturbed, Korn or whatever, it's all the same crap over and over anyway."
3,Overrated,"Not too long ago, I had considered Shadows Fall to be the next best thing for the heavy metal genre. Their previous efforts showed promise by offering some off the wall headbanging riffs and solos and an unmistakable death metal growl. When ""War Within"" was released, the hype surrounding it was so immense that it can be easy to explain why such high hopes were had for it, and while the album isn't bad at all, it's nothing special. The riffs seem more generic this time around, and elements such as some acoustic riffs are thrown in as well. Songs like ""Art of Contrition"" and ""What Drives the Weak"" are great tracks, but Shadows Fall just doesn't sound like themselves on ""Stillness"". ""War Within"" isn't a bad album at all by any means, but don't believe the hype surrounding it."
5,Thrash Reborn!,"Shadows Fall has to be the shining band of Amarican Metal. They were playing amazing song with solos in the hayday of nu metal. Now that takes balls. I'll admit Brian Fair is not the greatest singer BUT, if your a Shadows Fall fan like me, you'd know his voice fits perfectly. The bassist is acctually really good, makin nice interludes when the guitars go soft and Mat whips out his cean vox ala What Drives The Weak. Evey song on here is great, not one let down. The only song I ever consiter skipping over is The Act Of Contrition, because it sounds too much like Enlightened By the Cold. Shadows Fall have become too good to call them metalcore; they deserve the tite of the new thrash kings. Slayer hasn't made an album for 4 years, Metallica sold out, Exodus tries too hard, MegaDeth lost their umph and Testament lost their guitarist. So untill Slayer makes a new album Shadows Fall will stay in my CD player."
2,Bought at target for 7.99.....looking to sell,"The instrumentation: Imagine old school metallica but watered down and uninspiring.The vocals: Imagine trying to tell the guy down the street that he's pretty good, but wishing you could just tell him he should ""maybe try not to sound quite so......country.....or.....weak......weakish......maybe just try and sound like you're singing more from the heart or something. I don't know its pretty good Brian""."
3,Shadows fall little disapointed... I will explain...,"Ok first of all I love shadows fall, fan since the first album... but the art of balance blows this out of the water...Yes this album is technical as ever, more so then balance... but you cant get away from the RAW power of balance this album lacks that to a degree...War within shows more emotion which is good dont get me wrong I like the album, but I think they held back some aggression. It is heavy with all the heavy hitting, awesome guitar work, great drumming... I just, for me this album fell short of my expectations, I wanted something better than the art of balance and I didnt get it...its a good album and I will continue to listen to and maybe it will grow on me more, which it has... but it will never pale to the art of balance"
1,Dissapointing,"The evolution of Shadows Fall is very interesting. They started out as a very intricate, innovative metal band and have now become basically a new metal band with solos. Of One Blood features extremely creative melodic metal guitar. This new cd showcases they complete lack of fresh ideas. The dvd gutar lessons show some of the most typical,generic, boring riffs I've ever seen. Both of they guys are incredible guitarists but it seems like this cd was rushed and is subsequently a complete failure. Check out Of One Blood, and Somber Eyes To The Sky, for true Shadows Fall."
3,An Average Heavy Album,"I bought the album, thought it was okay. The vocalist lacks any energy and plus the lyrics are terrible. Some people may call them artistic, but what the heck is he even signing about? The guitars are average and the drums are good. Nothing, however, stands out on this album, I would not buy again. This is one mans opinion.Also, I saw them live last week and led me to dislike them further. They were not tight and sounded like crap. At least they try."
1,"Best Metalcore Band, yet average and unoriginal.","""Of One Blood"" was a good album, all the elements were crafted with the purpose of making a good metal record. ""The Art of Balance"" had a much more comercial orientated sound, it sold well and suddendly Shadows Fall were the kings of Metal, so on a lazy attempt they release this album, recycling everything they did on the past and showing an unconsistent emotional feeling with a hardcore attitude, well that is what makes Metalcore what it is, but at least was better composed on past records, which by the way don't get more than a grade 3 on Amazon's evaluation system."
4,Not Bad,"I read a lot of online reviews about Shadows Fall. It seems some don't give them the credit I think they deserve. Some people are upset with the direction the band is heading in. I have to admit it took me a lot of listens to get into this album. I now like what I hear. This is a much cleaner, but not as heavy, album compared to the (in my opinion) master piece Art of Balance. And I was looking for another sign of perfection. But this album is a little off. However, it is still worth the buy, if you are a true metal head."
2,REHASHED 80s METAL,"Did I just step into a time warp? It's fine and all to be into the old school metal. Hey I loved bands like Testiment and Anthrax back in the days, and dont forget the kings of metal...Iron Maiden! But trying to do what has been done by a million other bands before, and not as good, is just plain boring and just a rehash. Leave this type of metal in the 80s where it belongs. 2 stars because it reminds me of Testiment."
3,"Good, but could of been better","I was hoping for something more like 'Of One Blood', but it wasnt. Riffs are bland, drums are mediocre at best, and Brian needs to lay off tha singing a bit. Still tho, some songs show promise and keep me interested. Better than the Art of Balance"
4,Pretty Cool Metal album,"Before I start out I should say that I'm more into the classic metal, and I don't pay attention to tne nu-metal scene much because I am frankly annoyed by most of the bands in it (Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Ect.) Shadow Fall surprised me, though. My friend burned this album, and I kind of like to think of it as Slayer meets Iron Maiden with a little bit of Metallica mixed in. This is probably the best nu-metal band out there except System of a Down. Cool lyrics, excellent guitar. This is the kind of stuff I can headbang to without getting a headache."
2,another band gone mainstream,these guys are such sellouts... they are horrible now... the only reason i gave it two stars was because of the guitarists... he's the only good part about the band... everything else is terrible and mainstream
2,okay but there is better,"the album was okay but lacks originality. they sound too much like many others i've heard.these guys are definitely not ""the future of metal"" or ""the next metallica"" as some people would call them.you are much better off getting the new Lamb of God"
2,meh...,"...I always hear so much hype about shadows fall. about how they are a great metal band.....this is true. The BAND is good. The vocalist however, he comes off very cheezy to me. I don't see how he has any talent. Now dont get me wrong I really dig alot of metal bands with little singing such as Lamb of God, In Flames, Opeth....etc. But this guy he trys to sing more on this Cd than the previous (fromw what I am familiar with) and he just can't. He honestly needs to stick to the screaming kind of vocal, but I really dont dig that either. I honestly get the impression that he is ripping off the old school metallica James Hetfield and it doesn't work. My opinion is fire the singer, and hire someone who is meant to be a front man. Just cause he has dreds doesn't mean he can sing for a band. Pass!"
2,"Good instruments, weak vocalist.","When you hear a shadows fall song, you are instantly drawn in by fast and heavy instuments, but then driven back by a voice struggling to keep up.Seriously now, their vocalist is very weak for this kind of music, if they could get a better one then they would be much better. I saw them live at ozzfest last year and they were horrible.But, if its loud, then all the little metal heads will love it."
2,Don't Waste Time,"I admit, about two years ago I really liked this album, but it didn't last long. There are some good moments (Intro to ""Those Who Cannot Speak"", ""Eternity Is Within"", etc), but the whole package is really weighed down by three factors, one of which is the rather generic, pseudo-80s riffs that fill the CD (complete with the pseudo-Hetfield vocal histrionics). Worse is Jon Donais's relentless pinch harmonics, like a bunch of bees flying into your ears. But the real achilles heel is the drumming. Jason Bittner has some skill, but possesses the taste of week-old chewing gum. Every part of every song is bludgeoned by double-kick nonsense. Even acousic passages are beaten to the ground with obnoxious double-kick, completely destroying dynamics.Don't waste time with this disc: look more toward Of One Blood, which has more dynamics, less Hetfield, fewer pinch harmonics, and then-drummer David Germain uses double kick where only where it is required."
2,Not worth price,"It's ok for what it is, if you care what the American Poultry Association thinks, or if you are a collector of these books. I looked mine over when I got it, and haven't looked at it since. It certainly wasn't worth the price I paid, even considering the age of the book."
4,Solid addition to my pantry,"I used to use Progresso bread crumbs whenever recipes called fror bread crumbs. But after having tries some panko bread crumbs elsewhere, I experimented by purchasing a package of Sushi Chef Panko Bread Flakes. What a difference. The old bread crumbs are fine, of course, but this product really crusts chicken and fish beautifully and provides a nice addition to the recipe.So, I am a satisfied customer."
5,Quality Japanes Bread Crumbs,"Sushi Chef Panko Japanese Bread Flakes, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)This is a high quality brand of bread crumbs. They are light crunchy and extremely fresh."
3,Make no mistakes. This is far from a romance novel,"Dive revolves around an interracial couple, and is an examination of human nature and all of her emotions. Ray Rose is a white construction worker, whose physical beauty hides a sensitive, faithful, and caring soul. Because of Ray's loyalty to a friend, he commits a violent crime that continues to plague his dreams every night. Ruby Falls, a black female animator for a hit TV animated series is looking for herself. When a murder is committed outside her front door, her life goes into a tail spin. When Ray leaves his Florida home for Alaska to outrun his past, he runs directly into Ruby, where she has gone to escape her own memories. In each other, Ray and Ruby will discover the love of a lifetime. The book's description reads like a romance novel. Wait 'til you read the first few words of the novel! This a nice mixture of romance and action between the two main characters!"
3,Don Edwards/Last of the troubadours/saddle songs II,"This is an ok set of discs. A little on the tame side which isn't neccesarily a bad thing. I grew up cattle ranching and at night alot we'd drag out the guitar or just a harmonica or just no instruments and everyone would sing along to quite a few of the songs you'll hear on these cd's.Don is a strong singer and guitar picker, does a good job. I guess I could say this would be a good reference collection.If you've had a long hard day and just want to relax on the porch with a cold one and mellow out, this would be good for that. I wouldn't probably play it at a barbeque or a party as it's not a ""lets liven this group up"" sort of thing. But still good if you just want some Saddle songs like the tittle says."
5,Who FreakIN Rocks?,"This books got Many things going for it.I love it as a whole.It tells the personal story of many women and their relationships with their doctors both cancerous and benign!It tells about nutritional strategies for fighting the disease,and the wonderful and sometimes horrible relationships a woman can have with horrible doctors etc. I reccomend this on the comfort value alone as a resource tool which helped me invaluabley during a time of need.Love to you,Much love,and pleasE heal yourselves as I did with this book during my cheMotherapy."
5,Non-Victim Strategies for Breast Cancer,"""Women Confront Cancer"" presents strong, positive women who refuse to become victims of their disease. ""Passive patients fare worse"" is a Medical Literature classic truth, yet breast cancer patients are treated like robots: their bodies are cut, burned with carcinogenic radiation and poisoned in order to ""kill"" the cancer. Unfortunately, doctors can't kill disease, only the patient. Alternatives are the future. Disease cannot be cut out of the body, but cancer can be healed. It takes work and strength and dedication. It takes research and experimenting to find out what works. It can be done and without medical ""treatments"" which will someday be called the dark ages of cancer treatment. These women did it their way. They showed the way to survival. This book empowers all cancer patients, men or women."
4,"Not really ""fine line"" marking tips","I bought these because they identified themselves as ""fine line"" washable markers. The tips are virtually the same as the "" super tips"" markers. If the labeling were corrected, I'd give them five stars. I wrote to crayola about it, and they were apologetic, noting I was probably looking for something they used to call ""extra fine tip"" which are no longer manufactured. They even sent me $10 coupon for another purchase. Outside of thus issue, the markers are excellent."
2,Didn't do it for me,".I liked Rodney Crowell's last album very much and bought this on the strength of it. Sadly, Fate's Right Hand doesn't have the clever, complex, folky feel of The Houston Kid.Navel-gazing is the theme of the album, and it's all the worse for it. Crowell takes self-deprecation to a new and disturbing level; I cringed at some of the lyrics in these songs. The lyrics and the themes behind them seemed to me to be weakly conceived, half-hearted even. I didn't buy the cloying sincerity.Musically it is straightforward and I thought, rather monotonous: repetive choruses, endless lists of things half-cleverly put together, and the kind of noisy country rhythm that drives you mad after half a CD. It was quite shocking to find not one song that I liked - in total contrast to Crowell's previous effort. I'm puzzled by the change. And disappointed."
2,"Rodney, Snap Out of It!","I guess this is one you either really love or really hate. I can't stand the narcissistic self-absorption, the obvious lyrics (many of which already feel dated), the dark echo-chamber voice. Oh please. It's like being trapped in an elevator with some guy who wants to dump his half-baked opinions and self-important angst all over you.Please, Rodney, lighten up, back off, and cut it out."
5,Gets my highest praise,"Yes, it is this album that is a masterpiece, not The Houston Kid. Fate's Right Hand can be appreciated by a much larger audience. The risks taken in the songwriting pay off big time. The production has replaced country twang with a variety of intelligent arrangements"
5,Fate's Right Hand,"Sure ""Houston Kid"" was a breakthrough, but this album is a very worthy follow up. The sound and lyrics of ""Fate's Right Hand"" alone are worth the price of the CD. Very catchy and great writing. Some of the other tracks are relatively weak, but songs like ""Earthbond,"" ""It's A Different World Now,"" and ""This Too Will Pass,"" a tribute to George Harrison, round out the set nicely. The delayed release of the album make the Clinton references and the reflections on Harrison's passing dated, but, again, the sharp lyrics and fantastic arrangement of the title track set the tone for a solid, interesting, introspective album."
3,It's OK,"Simple user report: we get about 1,500 sheets per ml-1710 with text and some graphics. Thats about $0.05 per sheet (at $80 per drum)."
2,"Too expensive, not enough prints","This printer/toner is fine, but for the price of the toner, you don't get nearly enough print jobs to make it very economical. I've had this printer for a little over 2 years, and I'm on my 4th toner. I'm a student, so I definitely do a fair amount of printing at home, but my estimate is that this toner only gives me approximately 1500 pages. And that's with every level of tonersave on. So every 7 or 8 months, I'm dishing out another $80 to get more toner."
3,"Expensive per page, losing print quality","While this cartridge work significantly better than any of the refills I have tried, it isn't necessarily worth the money if you don't need finished draft quality. Especially since the print crispness has degrade significantly over the last month or so."
2,used when i thought I was purchasing a new cartridge,"the box it came in was only 75 percent in tact. Inside the box the cartridge was in a sealed black plastic bag. upon opening the bag, the cartridge was not new. for the price I paid, it was not worth a used cartridge. I would recommend purchasing a new cartridge and avoiding the risk."
5,Just Load and go,"Every time I need a new printer refill (not often) I agonize about buying the more expensive ""Name brand"" or the cheaper ""brand X"" refill. Every time I go with the more expensive option and never regret it. Life's too short to deal with the inconvenience and problems that the refills somtimes cause."
1,Save Your Money,"The print quality with the toner refill is terrible - light and streaky. Plus the shaft that turns the drum on the original cartridge started to stick, so there is also the chance of damage to the printer drive gear."
1,Cheap and doesn't work,"I bought this because I keep shocking my keyboard every time I walk up to my computer. I set it up correctly with the grounding wire connected to ground. The grey vinyl is not conductive enough. I can put my hands on the mat for 30 seconds and still get shocked when I touch the keyboard. It is not the grounding wire because if I touch the wire, it will discharge immediately. I've been told that the cheap mats are bad, and I guess I learned my lesson."
4,Enjoyable,"This is a poppy jazz album. I picked it up because I really enjoyed the cover of George Michael's ""Faith"". THe rest of the album did not let me down. It has been quite enjoyable to listen to over and over. She has great tone in her voice. I am still new to the band and know next to nothing about them. But this album has been great background music while sitting at my desk at work."
1,very bad,"beware ...this product does not rflect what you are getting...you get a net and a bunch of string... you are suppose to put all this together...how, is a guess...you get about a thousand strings of different colors and you have to attached them to the net( size of an hankershift).so don't buy this product.cost me more to send back."
1,Not What You'd Expect for $50,"first off, amazon does a horrible job of describing this item. I purchased small which is suppose to fit me and when I got it and measured it myself it was more like a large on their size charts (even though the tag said Small) also the quality was not as good as I expected because there were buttons falling off and strings coming out of every which direction. I ended up returning it for a refund because I could not wear it and it did not look very good at all even on someone who fit the jacket well (I tried to give it away at first)."
3,Pretty Good!,"This sequel was pretty good. It's an easy read and takes you into the world of Art. We now understand why Roxy Winters was in Paris to begin with and how she got there. We also understand why she chose the path she chose. However, the best character in the entire novel was Nicky. She told it like it was and didn't bite her tongue. I would like to read a novel centering around her character. She was quite strong despite the horror she went through."
4,Old-fashioned fun,"I'll watch any movie that has Maggie Smith and Michael Caine together; their comedic chemistry is strongly reminiscent of William Powell/Myrna Loy. It's also nice to see James Spader in a comic role, which he handles quite well.This is a very entertaining, light-hearted movie which wears well over more than one viewing. The only part of the plot that ever-so-slightly annoys (at least, it does me) is that the girlfriend, played by Polly Walker, never gives Spader's character a chance to explain; she always interrupts him, then runs away. But of course, that in itself provides some of the ""conflict"" in what would otherwise be a mere piece of fluff.This DVD is worth purchasing for Caine and Smith alone, and also for those of us who love old-fashioned fun."
3,Entertaining,This film was funny and very different. Wonderful to see Maggie Smith and Michael Cain together with James Spader equally matching them in the acting department. A plesant enough way to spend a spare hour or so.
3,Entertaining!,"This could have gotten 5 stars...if Hollywood would learn that you don't need to infuse bedding one another and fowl language to ""enhance"" a good plot! The plot is charming, but it is insulting to have to sit through cursing and a couple bed scenes thrown in for....who knows why they throw them in! The acting is great with legendary Michael Caine and Maggie Smith as the two battling spouses/ghosts. Almost well-done from start to finish."
3,Not bad,"Caine and Smith are wonderful of course, but the script was not witty enough to sustain the plot."
3,"Great Cast, Mediocre Film","I wanted so much to love this film. Maggie Smith & Michael Caine together again (first time: ""California Suite"")was a big reason I sought this one out. The story idea is pleasasnt enough, but too often the scenes seem to just ramble on. There are bright spots, usually when Smith and Caine are around. The dialogue needed much more sparkle to make this film more memorable. A bit of better editing might have also improved the whole piece. An enjoyable, but rather disappointing experience."
5,Great Entertaining Movie!! Great Actors!!,"This movie has such a talented cast that to watch it once is never enough! Each time you watch it, you catch things in it that you did not notice the time before. All Great Actors with Great performances. Who can ever get enough of Maggie Smith or Michael Caine!"
3,Buying a house with resident ghosts,"I admire Maggie Smith and Michael Caine but this was certainly not one of their best.The main character, a young fellow buying a house with the other two as resident ghosts is such a disappointing character. One wonders how he can run a publishing house when he can't manage to ever get meaningful words out of his mouth when dealing with his personal life, especially when dealing with his girlfriend.Another film that used this theme (and did a better job of it) springs to mind: THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR.Even fanciful films such as MR. PEABODY AND THE MERMAID---unfortunately not available on DVD---worked a similar theme better. CURTAIN CALL is not a keeper in our DVD collection."
5,must haves,maggie smith & michael cain do not disappoint in this feature great performances if you like maggie smith this is a must have movie if you can get past the james spader character who was more annoying then jar jar binks from star wars you will like this movie
4,Beetlejuice it isn't but still funny in a sophisticated way,"I have watched this movie many times. Michael Caine and Maggie Smith are wonderful, I wish they would do another one like the Topper series. James Spader is great also, sort of Cary Grant similar. I don't remeber Polly Walker very well, the weak link? You also get Buck Henry and Sam Shepard! The music is wonderful also, very beautiful movie. I am delighted with many small production company movies, Kill the Man was a strained comedy but at least it was a true comedy instead of some of the movies big production companies try to pass off as comedies."
4,Perfect baby gift :),"Nice, snuggly baby-toddler gift. Soft, washable, easy for tiny hands to grasp. Well made; I expect it is durable. A perfect welcome gift."
3,"Lil Snugglers Lamb ""Cream"" Blankie","I sent this Lamb Blankie to my daughter as soon as she found out she was expecting! The COLOR on the Picture is not what you get! The Cream color sounded very neutral. WELL the ""CREAM is a very light light yellow, not what I expected OR what CREAM actually IS. The Blanket is cute, but if you want gender neutral and expect Cream, only the face is actually Cream, look elsewhere!"
5,A great lovey!,"My 23-month old daughter loves this! I started putting her to sleep with it sometime before her first birthday hoping she would develop an attachment, and she definitely did! I like the security it gives her. I came here to order 2 back-ups as well. There are a couple of differences from my original. First, this one has a ribbon around its neck, and the first did not. The previous reviewer mentioned about the bows coming undone. This one does have that problem, whereas our first one has the knot of the bow sewn down so it does not come undone."
2,Uninitiated: beware,"For those who have not studied an alternative view of belief in the supernatural, this book will be convincing. Although I disagreed with it from start to finish, I have to admit that it is fairly well written. But beware, you may be taken in by its arguments if you haven't read the opposing view.A great example is its appeal to authority. By quoting or referring to a scientist here and there, it purports that science supports the Biblical view of the universe and creation. What it leaves out is the wealth of scientific material that contradicts the Biblical view."
5,An excellent book,This book provides intelligent and logical arguments in favor of a Designer and Creator of the universe. This is most certainly not creationism but rather a reasonable account of what the Bible states about creation and humanity as well as scientific findings about the latter.
1,Calling all feminists,"This book is for all you liberal feminists out there. Don't buy it if you really want a good read. It's great as a door stop, though."
1,Very disappointed!!!,If you're looking for deep House/Club remixes of this song YOU WILL NOT FIND IT ON THIS CD! Which is most likely why you're not given the option to listen to samples of these track. A mistake I will never make again... If you can't preview the album DON'T PURCHASE IT unless you know exactly what you're getting!
2,Abba's last and weakest album,"By the early 1980s, Abba and their disco sensibilities had started to seem like relics from the past. To their credit, they sensed this and called it a day. Unfortunately, their last album was not up to their ususal high standards for pop songwriting. ""One of Us"" is the only song on the album that measures up to their classics (and, I might add, the only song that appears on the career retrospective ""Abba Gold""). The title track is just plain bizarre and few of the other songs leave much of an impression. Despite what their detractors might say about their disco connection, Abba was a great pop band. This is just not one of their better albums."
4,"Disjointed, weird.......and sometimes brilliant","Continuing the ""post-disco"" vein (is that a new description?) of 1980's Super Trouper, The Visitors is something you have to listen to a few times to get into. The opening four tracks have some expansive synth sounds and some sharp melodies. ""When all is said and done"" is a remarkable contrast of upbeat melody and trademark Abba chord changes with regretful ""split-up"" lyrics.""Head over heels"" has quirky lyrics that could have appeared on any early Sparks album. The single ""One of us"" has another instantly memorable chorus and another heartbreak lyrical theme. On the minus side, ""Two for the price of one"", which is so ridiculous it almost works, could be the silliest track they ever did."
4,ABBA AT THE END,"One should have guessed when this album was released that it would be their last studio project. The cover alone demonstrates this better than anything else and was a far cry from the good time feeling of the Super Trouper project. They went out with a ""bang"" though. Lyrically it was their most mature project. ""The Visitors"", ""When All Is Said And Done"", ""Soldiers"", ""I Let The Music Speak"" all clearly demonstrate this. The songs on this project were of a much more serious nature than previous 70's releases. ABBA has always been referred to as the ultimate ""singles"" band, but this album is a far cry from that. My favorite track is ""When All Is Said And Done"". This track is the Frida-Benny end of relationship track much like Bjorn-Agnetha's ""The Winner Takes It All"". At least they went out on high note!!"
4,NOT AS GOOD AS SOUPER TROUPER,"this album is a good end to a superb career but there are some songs on this album that to me lack that abba-esque feeling the way other songs did on previous albums. the song i didn't like on this album was TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE i think it may have sounded like a good idea at the time but when its produced a totally different feeling is produced. On the other hand the must have songs on this album is ONE OF US , I LET THE MUSIC SPEAK , SOLDIERS and my personal favourite WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE. These songs show abba's maturity as a group. This is a good finish to a great career."
4,Surprisingly complex like a good cabarnet...,"I first heard ""The Visitors"" 25 years ago cruising around w/friends in college, and I remember my friend Diane warning us that this Abba tape would trip us out...the intro ""sounds like Rush"", I remember her saying. And for a guy who preferred hard rock and metal, I was intrigued. The melodies and the lyrics made you realize this wasn't the overproduced numbers that ABBA was famous for pop audiences in the US; it was mature in lyrics and its styling. Years later I bought the CD, and I can say it's one of my favorites when I'm in the mood for something somber and reflective - check it out if you don't have it."
5,An ABBA fan must have.,"This CD was quickly delivered by Amazon and I love it. This album is completely underrated! Their are so many excellent songs on this one, Soldiers, The day before you came, Under attack etc....Abba clearly shows that they could do any style of music without loosing that unique magical ABBA sound. This last Album from ABBA begs for more!Oh and it has this one song that a woman with no talent what so ever had to borrow, she completely butchered it! Leave the ABBA songs with Abba!"
4,A Sad Farewell to a Phenomenal Band,"It's been said many times already that this album differs from your typical Abba but that doesn't make it inferior in any way. Quite the opposite. This is one of their most creative works almost exclusively motivated by their crumbling marriages and their fading interest in the world stage. Sad and dark in places, the creativity never falters and as the last notes die away, you feel sad that such a fantastic talent such as Abba had to put their personal torments to music and call it quits. I will always remember them as one of the best with never a bad song. Thank you for the music!"
3,Intended for HOME builders not builders of wells or septics,"I am looking for a reference book to help me design a septic system and well for a new home project. I thought from the title that this book was appropriate (there was no table of contents available). It is not. Much of the book is geared towards helping general contractors avoid getting ripped off by well or septic subcontractors. If that is what you need, this is probably a reasonable choice. If you actually want to design and build your own well and septic systems, then pass on this title.I'm still looking for a good design/reference text for septic and well systems..."
4,It's worth your time to read this,"I picked up this Kundera's work to help me understand the motivation of the main character, Tomas, from the movie with the same title. What I received was a wonderful book on love, sex, and philosophy. Kundera explores the decisions we make - some based on coincidence, some based on carefully thought out actions - and how it shapes our lives. Set against the background of the 1960s political revolution in the Czech Republic, it was a worthy read."
2,"I would stick a ""weird"" label on it","I would stick a ""weird"" label on it. I cannot say I disliked it completely, but I think it is indeed odd book. A few episodes from life of 4 main chars of the book. All of them unfaithful and the writer sort of supports men's desire to sleep with as many women as he can, while he also shows how tolerant a wife can be if she loves her husband, even if his head has a smell of another's woman vagina. Sort of disgusting.What was this book about?Love?Life?Politics?Philosophy?...no idea, and the end is quite abrupt.The only character that I really liked, was a dog, Karenin."
1,The Unbearable Dullness of Reading,"This was a dull and very unimpressive book. Maybe I just don't appreciate high-art and metaphysical intrigue, but if you're like me and hate reading about existential crises and post-modernist ramblings for fun, then skip this one for your own good. If you're one of those people who can't appreciate Picasso's Cubist paintings, you'll be just as frustrated with this book. Plus underneath it all, it's just another harlequin romance (about a woman trying to find her ideal lover). If you really want to get your brains going in circles without all the pretentiousness, try Sartre's Nausea or Camus's Stranger."
4,ok,A decent book. Can get off course every now and again and I wasnt to fond of the ending. Overall it is a deep novel revealing more then just relationships. Hope this review helps I know those Rolling Stone wannabe's like to write essays instead of reviews to show how intellectual they think they are.
1,Confusion of abstraction and reality,"Milan Kundera is caught in Plato's cave, observing shadows on the wall and screaming, ""That is reality!"" When we peel past all the theory, and the clever merging of narrative and inner dialogue, we see revealed: the tedious, sentimental but unhelpfully obtuse European love story. These characters do not resemble any real person, but they resemble real weaknesses, and that is why is people like this book: they want to feel comradeship in weakness. There is no triumph here, the characters do not learn or grow, and really, it's a very boring read. I am not convinced of Kundera's interpretation of Nietzsche, either, except that by ascribing extremes to Nietzsche it makes an easy foil upon which to base one half of a concept in novel form. Perhaps this book means something to the academics, but I always thought the ultimate goal of all theory was to lead to better lives. This book does not, and I would not recommend it to any literature readers."
3,good title,"this is not the best kundera book I have read. I preferred his ""Immortality"" which to me is a much deeper and challenging book. However, a Kundera book is always a gift and a challenge."
2,Should have been an essay,"I really enjoyed some of the ideas in this book - especially the central contrast between lightness and weight. However, Kundera's method of introducing these ideas -- usually by interupting his characters -- made the novel really choppy. A lot of times, it seemed like the characters had impossible foresight -- that no one living would ever think such a thing at such a time. The character's were far too analyzed, leaving the reader with basically nothing to do but sit back and attempt to enjoy the rather dry writing. Overall, ideas great, but style terrible. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Using fiction to make a non-fiction essay about life in particular and in general,"This is a fiction novel from where the author takes elements of ordinary life to raise and extrapolate them to the debate about universal non fiction concepts. The setting and atmosphere goes about the end of the 60 s at the time of the onset of the Cold War when the Soviet Union had occupied what it was Czechoslovakia forcing the Czech citizens to live under a totalitarian communist regime or emigrate elsewhere in Europe. Is about the love and sexual life of two men (Thomas a surgeon (main character), Franz an academic scholar, and also of two women Theresa, Thomas` wife, and Sabina the artist painter and mistress of both men. Generally speaking the plot discusses universal exitencial concepts. At the time of its first edition back on 1984, this novel caused a great impact in the world and got an European Literature Prize."
4,inside the woman and the man.,The thing that stirkes me more than anything in this book is the sad realization of the fact that very light things(like crossing a certain border) could bring down heavy consequences. Consequences that would shape ourlives and hence ourselves in a drastically different way. All over the story the inside of the man and the woman performed the same torturing dance. But only inside the heavy she became certain that he loved her. She was happy to know that he really did(happinees is light) and she was sad(heavy) to see him the victim of the proof. Milan Kundera flips the coin of heavy and light showing us different faces (of many different dark colors) for the same two sides of his coin until all the faces blend. He is a true magician.
1,Unbearable is right!,"Am I the only reader who found this book contrived, soulless, meandering, egotistical and overrated?"
2,enh,"This one was not as good as they say. It is a good literature book for people who love stephen king and michael crighton. But if you are looking for something more than an airplane read, look elsewhere. It is somewhat sensationalist and a bit hypocritical. It is enjoyable enough, but almost any other slavic writer is better than kundera."
1,Disjointed and slow,I just struggled to finish this book. I don't know what all the fuss is or maybe I just missed the point. I found the book to be very disjointed with only a vague story. I didn't feel that the characters' personalities were well developed. I can now say that I read it but for me it was a waste of time.
1,Tedious,"Saying this book left me ""flat"" is an understatement. The characters and the author's attempt at philosophy was nothing more than tedious. Yep, that's all I can say... TEDIOUS!"
4,"a wonderful book, for thinking","This is a truly thoughtful book. It took me 3 months to read, which I think is mostly due to the incredible amount of philosophy that I may have been a little young for. It changed the way I look at life, however, which I admit is a cliche, but the ending is so powerful and reserved that it only left me with a slight edge of sadness, mostly just a feeling of peace. I definitely recommend this book."
4,"Weight, lightness, and the world of kitsch.","This is an amazing work. Kundera plays with opposing concepts, life and death, heaviness and lightness, dark and light, throughout his story. The characters are given a personality and set into motion. The narrator points out the way the characters think and then analyzes it along with the reader, thus blurring the distinction of whether or not these characters are people of the narrator's world or characters that he has created. And all of it set in a society of kitsch. Sentimentality, words that trigger emotions that we personally do not know nor can comprehend. Its wonderful how, in reading this novel, the reader can try to decide which life is happier: the light or the dark?"
1,returned it to barnes & noble,i hated this book and quit reading it halfway through. it's been awhile but with all the glowing reviews i just had to throw this in. some people will NOT like it and will hate that they even wasted time trying.
1,The Incredible Lightness of Being,"Ordered this book but never received it. Filed a complaint, but never got a reasponse."
1,disappointing product,"The book came in a disappointing condition. It has ragged pages, so it was absolutely unsuitable as a gift for my friend."
1,"Kundera's ""Lightness"" is Hopeless","I did not mind Kundera's unusual contemporary writing style. However, there were no noble characters in this book. The confused, selfish adulterous lifestyles of Franz, Sabina, Tereza, and especially Tomas, exemplify humanities hopelessness of which Kundera seems to celebrate through this novel. Despite humanities struggle to find or balance lightness and weight, hopelessness is inevitable without the external, absolute, and objective truth to anchor upon. The only character I was moved by was Karenin, the dog, who lived a much more purposeful life than his owners!"
1,let's put on some airs,"This book is just plain awful. Avoid at all costs. Sweet 'n' low is less artificial than this book. I mean come on!! If you are gonna make up a story, at least use a little imagination and invention. *this is a story about absolutely nothing, with no subtext, no entertainment* Why do people praise this book? Probably the same people who go out and buy some tom waitts (another way overrated snake oil seller) cds cuz they heard he's cool. Kundera is about 75 (he's probably older - just lying about his age) so hopefully he'll kick the bucket soon, and not leave behind any manuscripts. How long will we let Kundera serve us a number two on toast and call it gourmet? Stop the madness!! This book bites."
5,Top five,"This book is one of my top five books ever. It is wonderful. The type of book that you finsh and start over again. Most pages are dogeared and underlined. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to get a little more out of a novel than just entertainment. One tip - don't watch the movie first...it is too hard to put into a movie the philosohpical doctrines that Kundera creates in this book. Read it first, then watch the movie."
5,Kundera's genius,"This book will forever be one of my favorites. Kundera has an uncanny ability to put into words questions that any thinking human being has to come across. I first read it in another language, and am not sure that the english translation does not obscure the overall tone of the book. However, it is still worth anyone's time who has a desire to look deeply into the human soul. Kundera's writing genius is backed by an immense knowledge of philosophy and the arts, and he ties ideas together from across the centuries to show the basic questions that humans have faced throughout history."
4,An Amazing Novel,"This is one of the most amazing works of literature I have ever read. Kundera offers the reader a lot of insight into the different nuances that people have. There are qualities in the characters that one may recognize in one's self, but these reflections are done in a remarkable way that make each character refreshing.The novel is filled with obvious, and not so obvious, insights and wisdom that a reader could pull apart and think on. I keep a journal to document and reflect on books that I read, and this novel took a good number of pages.I definitely recommend this to any reader looking for something deeper, and perhaps just looking for something interesting."
2,an apathetic frenzy of existential angst,"We are all born, we live and we die. In between many things occur - some of which make us happy, and some of which make us miserable. Some even stir our loins for a moment.That's it in a nutshell, folks! The writing is adequate, and numerous characters have sex with each other. If that is your cup of tea, and you revel in ennui and other French diseases of the soul, by all means buy this book. I did laugh uproariously at the remarkable section about the importance of feces. Funny stuff. Hence, two stars rather than one."
1,Pretentious,"I thought this book sounded intriguing, but I found it pretentious and boring. It is really the author's philosophy disguised as a novel. It is one of the few books I couldn't even finish."
5,The greatest book of the 20th century,The Unbearable Lightness of Being is the greatest book written in the 20th century. The book is woven so tightly that it suffocates you. The language is so intense and just plain Kundera that it hurts. Kundera's building upon existential and Greek lights is extraordinary
3,contrived....,"I thought this was a contrived attempt to wrap ideas round a story. It thus never develops any momentum.And many of the ideas are oversimplified generalisations when you actually take a few minutes to reflect whether they are accurate or not.On a positive note, it is a no-frills and, in my opinion, accurate description of the futility of most of the stuff which keeps our minds temporarily occupied in life."
3,Kitsch,"Interesting plot and wonderful prose style, but pretentious and full of unnecessary political grumbling and insults. Pure kitsch. I felt a bit disappointed cause I know he can do better than that. If you never read anything by Kundera before, avoid this book. Start with 'Immortality'."
3,"Well-written, but a bit pretentious","This was the first Milan Kundera novel I've read. Overall, I really enjoyed it. It was emotionally stimulating and intellectually daring. However, it was also incredibly pretentious. It felt as though Kundera was was costantly attempting to remind me of how profound his ideas are. I gathered that fact simply from the originality of this novel, and I didn't need Kundera to keep reminding me. This was really the only flaw I found in the novel. All in all, an exceptional novel-"
5,300 page symphony,"Ezra Pound once said something to the effect of ""A poet that is not interested in music is not a good poet"". I don't know if Milan Kundera ever heard this piece of advice but he certainly seems to have taken heed to it. Very much like a symphony, this book contains very musical aspects such as repetition of key phrases, notes (or words if you will) that seem unimportant then subconsioulsy affect every other part of the piece, and a need to truly be listened to. ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" refuses to be background music.I beleive trying to tell you what the book is about betrays one of it's core messages, which is you can only know what something means to you, commmunication is a hopelesss but necessary exercise. Find a quiet place, read the book slowly, and truly contemplte the things it has to say. You'll be glad you did."
4,Really Enjoyable!,I really enjoyed reading this. The way he argued his opinion against Nietzsche's was surprisingly enjoyable given the heavy philosophical nature of the topic. I found myself relating the all of the characters even though they were all so different. I loved the way Kundera wrote. This is one that I must read again.
2,Kitch,"Hoping for the author to redeem his irony, I suffered this book all the way to the end, but found it nothing but a potboiler."
5,Lightness and Weight,"By far one of the most impressive pieces of modern literature I've ever had the good fortune to read. The mosaic created by the lives of the four main characters, interspersed with intriguing philosophical blurbs and anecdotes, is superbly done. This translation is beautifully accurate. Really something that no educated person should go without reading; as a lover of good literature, I highly recommend it."
3,Enjoyable for the most part,"The quintessential apex of the hierarchy in enjoying this novel unequivocally resides within Kundera's embracement of ideas and their translation to the page. The non-linear back-shadowing admist a political background is entertaining, as is the developing love stories between the protagonists. What is less inspiring, however, are the characters themselves, who are somewhat forgettable."
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"This book is one of my old time favorites. It doesn't follow conventional style of novel. it is a mixture of Kundera's philosophy and creativity. If you want to know what it means, you gotta read it. p.s. If you like it, you'll like ""Immortality"" by the same author."
2,"at the very least, get it from the library.","I borrowed this novel from a friend who sang its praise to no end. I have since come to the conclusion that said friend and I do not have the same taste in fiction. She seemed to glean some deep philosophical meaning from the novel, as many people do, or apparently so from all the babble going on about it. The babble is sometimes very difficult to follow, and I was in no way enightened by the novel. The sex was gratuitous and the protagonist was unsympathetic. Although I have to give Kundera some credit, for writing a mildly misogynistic and wholy uninteresting novel almost entirely about sex and very faintly about oppresion, and then somehow convincing a slew of young western women (surely you've encountered a few) to tirelessly laud and contribute great genius to it."
2,The Unbearable Weight of Kundera's Ego,"I never thought I'd say this: this novel made a much better movie. Why? Because Kundera didn't write it. Although considered a virtuoso by many, Kundera can't tell a story without reminding you he's telling a story. Tereza, Tomas, and Sabina never come to life because the author of their story refuses to share the limelight with anyone. Over and over, Kundera adds his observations and such just when the story is beginning to roll. Furthermore, he's a condescending ass: how many scenes do you have to explain to us, Milan? Also, this Czech is definitely male: his women fall into the boring, old saint and sinner categories. Finally, if you've read Sartre, Nietzsche, or any philosopher claiming to be an existentialist, Kundera's philosophy is tedious rehash."
2,Unbearable.,"Read this book as an undergrad English major, didn't care for it. Read it again in a wonderful graduate companion course, still didn't care for it. I appreciate what the author was trying to do, the philosphical prose...but it was painful for me to get through."
5,Understanding the Book,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a truely incredible book, something that comes along once in a while. If you are able to get past the rude and crude every day world exhibited in this book, and look at it through a metaphorical level it offers us what we have all been looking for."
4,Highly graphic and unstoppable reading,"I'm meant to read this book for class in two years so I decided to get a head start. I think it will be interesting to study, Kundera is a very interesing author. The only problem is that I can't find any kind of cliff notes which I need to help me understand some parts of the book."
2,God-awful crap,"It seems that Kundera got confused between writing a philosophical treatise and a novel--a nasty experience to say the least. Instead of creating characters and action, Kundera get's bogged down in his own philosophical wanderings on life, and just him mentioning such greats as Nietzche and Tolstoy in this book makes me want to vomit. Thank God both those writers are dead, but I on the other hand was not spared from the stench of this literary poop. It truly contains some of the most frightful prose ever written. Yes.....it's that bad."
3,The Unbearable Lightness of Being,This book is not for everyone. It seems to have better reviews from other countries. I felt that it read more like a case study and you needed a masters degree to understand the hidden meanings in the book. It really had to be more than an oversexed man having sex with every woman he came in contact with.
2,DOUBLE D's...Dull and Disjointed.,"This book is incredibly uncompelling and dull. I felt the characters were weak and the story and philosophies disjointed. If you want to read a book where the plot is much more gracefully entwined with philosophy, read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence. This book was trying too hard to be pretentious...in fact, it was just boring. I don't mind pretentious books...if they are good. I was very excited to read this, as I never had, and found it to be a huge disappointment. Still can't get over how disjointed it was."
2,Odd,"I had no idea what type of book this was, nor anything about the writing of Kundera when I purchased this book. I wish I had.The book chronicles different people's lives and journey's, but their lives are just a subtext to the writer's general philosophy on life, which is infused throughout. His philosphy is a little odd, and very VERY European. There is a tinge of melancholy that runs throughout his philosphy, and the very Un-American idea that things don't always work towards a greater good, or that things that happen don't necessarily have a point. (Did this book have a point?)Reading this book was like being flipped upside down a few times and not knowing where you will land. If you would like to read a good fiction novel, this is not it. I think this should be put under philosphy, rather than fiction."
4,A New Experience,"I cannot offer many of the erudite reviews of my peers, however, I did read this book and have been thinking about it since I finished a few days ago. It seems to be well written, with themes that I would call profound. The amazon summary puts it nicely: ""...one that requires of listeners a dollop of patience."" This book had some very interesting philosophy in it that will keep me thinking for a while. About the nature of love and its power on people, about fidelity and sex and death. However, I must note that this was not an easy read for me. I may often make the mistake of choosing books in which I can ""learn"" some secret to life, and while this book did impart some new wisdom upon me, it was slow and difficult to continue at certain times, at least for my current preferences."
4,Worthwhile,"This book is by no means an awe-inspiring masterwork but is certainly a wonderful, highly readable gem of a book. The images and characters in this novel remain with me still and the story is subtly powerful. This is a book that will cause you to question your personal dogmas, the meaning of love, and communication barriers between individuals. My main criticism is that the language was not quite thick enough for me. Personally, I favor rich, impractical language and a lyrical voice. I understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea, but I regard it as the major shortcoming of this work. However, in light of all the shining virtues of this novel, a little disagreement over word choice seems petty. You are fortunate to have found this work. It is, without question, a worthwile read."
5,I go backto this book every few years,"This is definetely one of my favorite books ever. I read it fires time in college, and we all were fascinating by it. And I go back and read it again every few years.Kundera writes the way that it feels like he is simply sharing his thouths and reflections with you while telling the story of the couple, not really knowing himself where is it going to. His language is easy and appaelling. He makes you think and feel, and explore human nauture but not to judge the characters.This is not the book for someone who accepts only fast-pace action in the book. You need to slow down for this one, but you will find a pleasure reading it.I also recommend the movie based on the book, under the same title, with Juliet Binoche starring as Theresa."
3,"Not bad, but lacks content","This was the first of Ms. Roehm's seasonal notebooks that I purchased. I have since bought the other two, and am anticipating the Spring notebook due out soon. While the photos are exquisite, I feel that the book lacks content. I couldn't help wishing there was more of everything in this book - more pictures, recipes, etc. I enjoy a good ""picture book"" and that's most likely the reason I'm awaiting the last book to the series. I couldn't help comparing her to Martha Stewart, and I'd gladly welcome a new face in that field, but it just doesn't come close to Martha's myriad of ideas. The bottom line is: if you like to look at pretty pictures and get some inspiration for decorating your own home, then you'd probably like this book."
2,Book had glue lines on the front and back covers.,I bought this as a gift for my fiance's mom and when she opened it the first and last pages were stuck to the glue on the covers. She would not let us return it. I'm glad she was happy because I was super embarrassed!
5,Great seller,Received this item in a timely manner. Product is as described and works as designed. Very reasonably priced too.
4,Full of promise and potential.,"This self-titled debut is full of promise, and the occasional glimpse of greatness. The melodies are subtle, and the bass and rhythm are outstanding. Most of the songs quickly establish a steady groove that the band plays with, occasionally drawing it out too much. The second song, ""Glide"", is amazing. Great for any fan of acid jazz with a little funk thrown in."
5,simply beautiful,"wow - smile is a beautiful, soothing tune frm a gorgeous lady - if u like reggae, u gotta like this artist"
3,"Pretty decent, the cat's play in it sometimes.","The product itself seems pretty quality, but ultimately the review has to be geared towards how frequently my two cats actually use it. They'll run in there sometimes, but still seem to prefer blanket tunnels I make them (or pillow caves). It's nice I can collapse it together and get it out of the way though. I have to say I probably would not have bought it after seeing how disinterested the cats are in it most of the time (they're actually both ~7 months old now)."
1,Too small!!,"I should have listened to the people who mentioned this. Be clear. This is absolutely too small for adult cats. They cannot stand up in it and cannot physically fit through the two port holes. I'm really disappointed. It would only need to be a couple of inches in diameter larger to be successful.But again, this isn't even close to being useable for an adult cat, and ours isn't even a particularly large cat. Don't buy this unless you just want it for kittens."
5,My cat LOVES this tunnel!,I was very surprised when I got the cat tunnel in the mail because it is made very well. The fabric is durable and the inside is lined with some sort of crinkle material. My cat LOVES this tunnel! She plays all day with it and has incorporated it in to her daily runs around the house. It is wonderful that it folds down to a circle for easy storage while I have guests over!
5,Perfect cat toy,"Before adopting my two kittens, I (like any new pet owner) searched high and low for toys for them. I didn't realize how expensive they've gotten (it's been years since I've had a pet), so I had to be choosy. After reading the reviews, I decided to bite the bullet and get this toy. Omigod - they LOVE the tunnel. They dart in and out, jump on it, and even sleep in it. Now that they're getting older, they don't use it as much, but they still love it.Minor issue - you will need to secure the tunnel using the ties on each end, otherwise it rolls over and they can't use the openings on top (which they love). Other than that, it's fabulous."
5,Smaller cats would love it,"Smaller than I thought, cats less than 10 pounds would enjoy it better. It also gets pushed around easily. So we put boxes on top of it to stabilize it. Otherwise our 1 year old loves it!"
3,Too small,"Tunnel is super small in diameter, i have two good sized cats and only can actually fit in here and even then he can move forward."
4,Cat loves it,Only thing that was a disappointment when I received it the ball was not atytached like it was supposed to be and she like playing with things hanging on string.
2,Too Narrow for Adult Cats,"I was disappointed with this tunnel because it's so narrow. It would be perfect for little kittens but not adult cats, unless yours are tiny. I have two males - one is 9lbs, the other is 12lbs - and they're both way too big for this tunnel. It's made well, though, and is attractive and the material is also nice."
3,"Great for kittens, not adult cats","This cat tunnel is well made and would have been a perfect toy for my cats, except that the diameter of the tunnel is too small. I would recommend this for kittens only, not for adult cats."
3,Good product,"I just received this item a few days ago, so I do not yet have a lot of experience with it. My 13 pound cat appears to like it, however, and the tunnel looks just as pictured on the product page. Mostly, I wanted to post a review to say that the 13 pound adult cat fits in the tunnel with room to spare. He fits in and out of at least one of the ""port holes"" in the top of the tunnel as well. All of which is to say that this is an appropriate toy for medium to large (but perhaps not obese) adult cats."
5,Quality Product,"My husband was very pleased with this Makita Template Guide. He said it was well-made, fits perfectly and would recommend it to others."
3,Does what they are supposed to do,These have helped reduce flats for me. I ride on a lot of city trails with broken glass that was causing punctures fairly regularly. These have reduced the number of flats I have gotten.
1,Slice tubes wide-open,"My mom got me a pair of tire liners for my mountain bike tires when she got tired of driving into the woods to rescue me. Funny thing: I didn't even make it to the woods with these. The sharp edges of the tire liner cut a wide, completely-unpatchable several-inch-long slash in my inner tube.WHY has this garbage product not been recalled? Any ideas for what I can do with these worthless strips of plastic?"
1,Causes flats rather than protecting from flats,"I am very puncture prone and bought this product to safe guard myself. However this product has caused many more punctures by slicing my tubes. I have tried covering the edges with duct tape, but it has been of no use.Pretty poorly designed product-Nikhilesh"
1,They do in fact cause flats,"I bought these at the local Walmart for about the same price as it goes for on here... I had read the reviews here and thought the tire slicing reviews wouldn't apply to me because my V2100 had 2.125"" tires. I went out on a 15 mile ride in ~35 degree weather on Sunday night, and the next morning noticed my rear was flat. The end of the liner in contact with the inner tube had cut a crescent shaped groove and had caused a pinhole at one of the corners. I didn't have a spare tube with me at the time since I had a (non-liner related) flat on the front tire the previous day, I can't believe how close I came to being stranded, at night, in cold weather, 7 miles away from home. Needless to say neither tire has this liner anymore.Since I ride streets frequently I need protection from unseen broken glass. These are not the solution."
2,Not very happy,"I think there may be quality control problems. I've used these liners in the past without problems, but this set really cut into my tubes, and I went through a variety of tubes before removing the liners."
3,slime liners,"when, I installed the liner the first time, I got a flat by the air valve it might have been a pinch flat cause by the over lap. After patching the tube, I had half tire on rim with liner in place and the over lap away from the air valve. I installed the tube with some air in it, which helped keep the liner in place. Double checking has I went around installing the second half of tire over rim. So far no flats after two weeks and 16 miles of city riding"
2,"prevents punctures, but slices tire","I ran one of these (of a different size) in my front tire, 700c32, 60-70 psi for 8 months on roads. I had no punctures during that time, which I believe I would have had without the liner, but then the liner cut a hole in my tube. It was at the end of the liner, where the tube under high pressure has to stretch itself over the sharp ledge. it was a small enough cut to patch, but I'm not letting that liner back in my tire.I used glue to help position the liner in the tire as I assembled it; experience with tire liners in general tells me if I hadn't done that, it would likely not have been centered and a puncture in the tread area could get past it.Another liner, maybe not this brand, once sliced my tube lengthwise in S-curves, as it was not centered in the tire. Had to throw that tube out when one slice finally got all the way through."
1,more harm than good,"As noted elsewhere, these liners are nearly impossible to install uniformly centered in the tire and the sharp liner edges will damage and actually cut into the tube. Living in AZ I gotta have flat protection, but these liners are a problem, not a solution."
1,"These liners cause flats, buy Tuffy liners instead.","I ran these in my mountain bike for a while with over 60psi in my tires for commuting to work...they worked great with that much pressure. When I went down to trail pressure (50psi or so) I got one ride in before they caused a laceration all the way around the tube that was not patchable...there was literally a cut all the way around the tube from the edge of the liners. Other brands (Tuffy Liners, for example) have a tapered edge that is not as sharp as these. Slime needs to redesign these things in a big way. I love the thickness of them for the thorns I deal with, but they really need a tapered edge. I would avoid them."
2,This liner may be slicing my inner tube,"I installed the liner on both the front and back tire. Since I had a major flat on the rear tire before I installed the liner, I also replaced the inner tube with one prefilled with slime. 30 min into the initial brisk ride on city streets, the new inner tube burst. I replaced it with a 2nd slime inner tube - 10 days later, burst again. Kind of wondering if the liner is rubbing against the inner tube. I noticed a 1-2"" laceration along the tube slightly off center. I am now trying something else - buying a kevlar tire with a generic inner tube and did not install the liner on the rear tire - will see how this lives up. Bottom line, I suspect the liner causes the inner tube to slide around and eventually rub against the inner tube and cause it to tear."
1,This item DOES slice your inner tubes,"Bought these at the recommendation of my LBS. By the next day I had two flats - slice marks, not puncture marks, in my tubes. Walked my bike home then went back to the bike shop and got a refund for the Slime liners and two free new tubes. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,Doesn't stop thorns,I was hoping these would be as good as Mr Tuffy. Very disappointed. We have lots of puncture weeds where we live and they go right through the liner without any problem. I would not recommend buying them.
4,I love the slime,"I bought this product a while back and it works great. I have had other types of puncture resistent tubes and the gunk that you put inside your tube to make them seal right away after a puncture, but what I like best about this is that it is easy to install, and it is much lighter than the puncuture resistent tubes. I would definately recommend this as a cost effective and easy way to protect your tires from getting popped!"
4,Could Be Sticky,"Durable, useful. Too bad tires aren't better to start with. Liners are awkward to install - would benefit from a sticky side to hold them against the inside of the tire during installation."
1,An absolute waste,"Have used tire liners for for over 20 yearsOriginally used Tuffy, which were and are good.Have also used Slime liners for years, which were good and now have no positive value.Others have mentioned their sharp edges cutting tubes ... This is true - Slime liners have sharp edges on both the end and sides - these cut tubes.Also instead of being molded ( rounded to the two curves of a tire ) Slime liners are flat. The result is the Slime liner snakes around on the inside of the tire, sometimes going all the way down the sidewall.With a little finishing by the manufacturer ( smoothing the edges, molding the shape ) they would be useful. As currently sold, they cause flats."
1,Slime with Sleaze,"Ditto for me. I had the same problem as phwang. I did a search on the web and found others have too. After getting a flat in the rear tire I thought I see what I could do to prevent it. I picked up both a Slime tube and Slime Tire Liner. One thing about the Slime Tire Liner is that it is difficult to run down the center of the tire. The liner does not have an adhesive. You are relying on the tube you are installing to hold it in place. After two repeated flats with the slime liner, each with in a couple of days, I took out the Slime tire liner and noticed at one of its ends it got folded double creating a some what sharp edge. The hole was a pin hole size, much less than an eighth inch which is published by Slime to instantly patch. It did not seal the hole even with the tube outside of the tire. Exasperating! Maybe Slime can work, but I am not a believer. It's aggravation!"
3,Won't stop thorns,Product proved useless in protecting tube from thorns. My advice - Use regular slime in the tires instead.
1,Didn't work,I used a slime liner with a slime tube and I still got a flat within within two weeks of installation. Don't waste your money.
2,Not Her Best,"Unless you want the complete Ferrick collection, I recommend skipping this one. Except for ""Hello Dad"", ""Breaking Vows"" and the title track, the lyrics on 'Massive Blur' are not her strongest. Some (""For Once in My Life"") are whiny. The percussion lines are repetitive and routine. The electric guitar does not showcase Ferrick's talent as well as the acoustic sounds of 'Willing to Wait' or '70 People at 7000 Feet'.The title of this CD is, unfortunately, apt - many of the cuts blur into one another. Save your money and catch one of Ferrick's consistently superb live performances instead."
2,Instant book of lasting value,"This is a quickie book of reportage on the Vatican conclave which elected Joseph Ratzinger to be the new pope. The many interviews with cardinals on deep background that are woven into the story are most enlightening.The account of John Paul II's final weeks is good. One is stirred anew at the impression of the sheer greatness of this man on his flock. The potted biography of Ratzinger is fine, but the long section of predictions on what Benedict will do must quickly become obsolete, as he actually progresses with his reign."
3,The Papacy of Benedict XVI.,"Allen details the rise of Joseph Ratzinger of Germany into the papacy. As Pope John Paul II's right hand man, Benedict is probably one of the more knowledgeable and intelligent men to come into the office of Pope. His challenges are immense, such as the secularity of Europe, the poverty of the south, and the sex abuse cases in the United States. However, this is a man who brings a wealth of experience to these daunting challenges. Ratzinger is considered a conservative member of the College of Cardinals, so being considered a moderator in his new role may help him assume some of these challenges.This is an interesting read. Allen tries to summarize some of the new Pope's writings on beliefs, and some of this material is hard to understand (concept of relativism). One gets a flavor of what the new Pope will be like. However only time will tell on how the world views Pope Benedict XVI."
2,Dancing to New Orleans,Not very much dancing. The music that is there is good but none of the music was played from start to finish. Too much bio. I wasn't happy to have spent almost $22 for it.
2,Terrible Packaging,"They sent me this item twice, both times it was the wrong seat cover and the packaging looked like it was thrown into a box and sent off. When I received the box, it was crumbled up and slightly open. I had to send both packages back and have not yet received any compensation for it. Very Poor"
3,Not quite for beginners,"The audio CD begins with a pronunciation guide to introduce you to how to pronounce both consanents and vowels in Hungarian. The conversations are presented in two parts, one at normal pace then a second time with pauses for repitition. The part afterwards is the audio of the vocabulary used in the conversation. What I don't like about the audio is that there is no English translation following the Hungarian vocabulary. If you want the translation of the vocabulary you need the book to look at it."
5,lifelong reader,"Initially I found this almost too painful to read, but turning the pagesopened up a story of great hope, empathy, wisdom and optimism. The factthat the author's journey through familial emotional and physical abusebrings her to a place of forgiveness and personal healing, is a testamentto her compassionate nature and inner strength.Her descriptions of the people and places in her book are quite vivid, andI see the whole story as movie material, especially since it takes placeduring a specific period of time in the Pacific Northwest."
5,A Storyteller's Life,"Clara became a storyteller in her later life. That was the only way she could review her long difficult journey into adulthood and try to come to grips with the harsh reality that she had endured a childhood of unspeakable cruelty and meanness. Clara was born with a good natured heart and a keen intellect that always pulled her through the trials of life and finally made her whole. The one bright light in her young life was a teacher that opened her mind to the gift of the written word and the promise of an education. Her love of books opened her world up to the study of mythology, spiritual teachings and dreams that gave her life meaning."
4,"Feels heavy duty, will come back to rate performance",Heavy duty and security to give me peace of mind. And I will come back and rate again on performance after someone tries to challenge it.
4,SN890RH,"First you should not use any framing gun that is not shouting a round head nail. Its called ""code"". Framing code is 3"" X.131 Round Head everywhere in the U.S.A.[sence 1948]and roof rafters are 3 1/2 x .131 round head.the ""MAX SN890RH"" has the same insides as the SN890ch/34. It will not double fire has a built in filter and has alot of power.It has a trigger lock so you don't shoot your self or your fellow worker and on both the SN890RH and SN890CH/34 they have a anti jam door . the door is used more in the SN890CH do to the generic nails that people buy that can have the WRONG angle. You need to buy 34 degree nails if you don't want jams.MAX also makes some of the Paslode Air tools for them. If you are useing wood that is LVL then you will need to move up to the new 400 PSI guns that MAX makes.The MAX line is the best nail gun line i've seen in my 36 years at the bench.I have been fixing all power tool lines for 36 years in the New England area."
2,expensive letdown,does not sink nails or keep up with a paslode. tricky loading and fortunetly it has a jam door bacause it jams once a day. My next gun might be senco's framepro or a paslode.
4,"Simple, Effective Meter, if not for measuring Amps","I really like the meter...simple three-position switch (combining AC and DC); the tips on the leads are replaceable, but the leads are permanently attached (why?). The only other complaint is that the notch for the ammeter is too small for even medium-gauge wire."
2,Too low of Resistor scale,"Resistance scale only goes to 1000k, Bought it as a multi use meter for electronic/electric troubleshooting but can't check heater or resistor troubles."
1,less than expected,"Unfortunately I purchased this Fluke Test Tool and I discovered that the resolution is very pooronly 1 volt means no chance to distinguish between 1,49 and 1,51 volts battery measurement, no diode measurement,very low scale for resistance, (1000 ohm maximum) But this is my fault. This is not a tester for electronic engineers, it is ONLY forElectrical Engineers , Installers ,and Electrical Power Engineers. The overall design is very good and handy.Take care useful ONLY for Electricians."
1,"""0"" stars",Unfortunately this unit lasted maybe 4 or 5 playings. I was so desperate when I bought this..I had a 2 screaming toddlers in my van and out of town. I also have a Memorex (has worked for over 2 yrs) and a Polaroid (just now having some trouble with it after a year). It's really sad that one pays $100 for a unit that may only last a yr if lucky. I suggest you go for a Memorex and pray for the best.Don't buy this!!!
4,Pleased after a year,"Having a DVD player on an airplane is a must with young kids. We bought this dvd player after several other brands failed on us in a three month period. It has been very reliable on the plane and on trips and at home. I think its been dropped several times and it still works great. My 4 year old and 2 year old enjoy a special retreat at home with it. Its inexpensive, durable and I have found it to be reliable. The battery life seems to last a lot longer than other brands. :)"
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought this player because it was so cheap. After initial charging of the unit I watched a movie using battery power. When I went to re-charge the unit by plugging it in, it wouldn't power up. No power what so ever, even when plugged in. I contacted the warranty website twice and did not have any response. Finally I called the 1-800 number and they told me I would have to mail the unit to them, at my expense, and it would take at least 4 weeks before I'd get it mailed back to me. They promise to ""fix"" it but who knows. I only used the player once! Do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get a namebrand."
1,after a while ..even Tas' antics gets tiresome.. xxxxx,"Tas was never meant as a solo starrer , in many aspects he has the makings of a supporting cast and nothing more. I really can't think of a reason 2 recommend this book. If u've read my other reviews on other dragonlance titles u'll notice i'm not quick 2 discriminate or 2 judge , but this book is'nt really worth the paper it wuz printed on. Very Harsh but i need 2 get a pt. across. sorry Mary. Sumwhat good - reminiscent writing. Good storytelling style . Bad bad story. END"
4,Kirchoff - One of Us - lives & breathes Dragonlance...,"I, myself own ALL of the DL books published to date (apart from the ""annotated chron's"" and ""Lord Toede"" - Villains) and have read all of them over & over. When I bought Kendermore I knew I was on to a winner - it's Mary Kichoff after all - as it was written by one of the ""old firm"" DL writers . The book itself is excactly what most DL fans had hoped for - a slightly more in-depth feel for a character who is usually (or was - he's ded now...)quite peripheral in the Chron's.He later shows this ""deeper"" character again in the Legends (esp. when time-travelling with Caramon), and he then carries this demeanor throughout - Wanderlust, Dragon's of Summer Flame etc... still managing to be his witty, amusing self and SO I cannot agree with earlier reviews that Kirchoff has detracted from Tas' character but she has certainly enhanced it in my opinon. Thanks Mary..."
3,Okay,I'm sure the writing was excellent but Tas is portrayed terribly! I couldn't stand reading any further than about 50 pages because he was so quiet and unexciting. I'm sure it was a good book but Tasslehoff needs more life!

BIG UP TO MY MAN TASTE!!! ---- p-MURDER"
4,"Get it, If only for Mott and Mick","I saw ""Amongst Friends"" around its release, thought it to be flawed yet poignant and rather good. The same can be said for the soundtrack, which is a highlight of the film and does an good job at capturing the spirit and times of the story. The bright spots for me were ""All the Young Dudes"" with its touching, anthemic nostalgia by the hugely underrated 70's band Mott the Hoople, The Clash's Mick Jones' exquisitely evocative, coolly elegant ""Long Island"", and the folksy, bittersweet charm of ""Innocent Child"" by Jones' group Big Audio Dynamite II. I didn't care too much for the rap songs, not my cup of tea, but it has it's place here since the film is set during the late 80's/early 90's when the genre was emerging in a big way. Anyone who was around during that era surely remembers Tone Loc's ""Wild Thing"". It's good to see the very good but unfortunately obscure 80's band Dramarama also included on this soundtrack."
1,Monograph Author,"I'm the author of this monograph, which I wrote nearly 25 years ago. The research described in this monograph is considerably outdated. More recent and sophisticated analyses of how the news media influence public concern about issues are available. The monograph is not worth nine dollars. If you visit my author page, you'll find recent books I have written, which are cheaper.Kim Smith"
1,Smoking Room,"Smoking Room has no action. It consists only of close-up shots on individuals talking about how an American Company has crossed the line in trying to get the locals to not smoke in their workspace. It looked as if it were to be a comedy, and there is nothing funny about it. In addtion, many vulgar words are used. I wanted to use it in my Spanish classroom to show native speaking and differences of cultural opinions, but due to the language AND the poor subject matter covered in the film, I wasted my money."
3,Oh yeah.,"The first three songs on this album are amazing. But don't get deceived the rest pale in comparison. There's nothing on the album like Novidade. I would love an album of his more upbeat songs done in the ""Unplugged"". If you're looking for good slow Brazilian songs acoustically I haven't found one great album yet. But there are four or five good tracks on Caetano Velosos ""Prenda Minha"". Tudo Bon?"
5,gil é o melhor de todos!!!!!!!,Gilberto Gil é um dos maiores ícones nacionais e é um orgulho para todos v-lo reconhecido mundialmente. Como brasileiro sugiro Gilberto Gil como uma mostra da boa música nacional.
4,A bit outdated,"DK seems to publish a book every year, and this companion is already outdated. Gives a great synopsis of each DK book and a lot of info on the author himself. Checklist is helpful if you are a DK fan and MUST read each book like me."
2,"Too many inaccuracies to be a ""reference"" book -","While this little pocket size book would be helpful to a novice fan, for the true collector it is a waste of money. You would be far better off getting the Katherine Ramsland biography for reference, although that one has become dated as well."
4,excellent finish,I was hesitant due to the price point as I can usually purchase this type of door lever for around $10 but not with the Schage name of course. I needed to match a Schlage nickle finish for an outside door were it would be noticeable and so I made this purchase. I have to admit the fit and finish is worth the price. Very smooth action and perfect finish...comes with several plate options for the latch...
5,Schlage passage lever,Very solid feeling and easy to install. The handle feels very comfortable in my hand. The brushed nickel finish is perfect.
4,It's sexy!!!,Very pretty shoes.. Looks just like the pic. The size is fine for me too (I do have narrow feet). I have a hard time walking on carpet in these though!
5,Good seller,This seller was very prompt in processing my order & they shipped quickly. I will order from again. Thanks
3,"Book OK, but shipping to long",Beside buying this book with Amazon I also bought another from ebay the same night. I receive the book from ebay in 3 days and this one from Amazon in 17 days.
1,Never received book,"I ordered a book from the seller, never received it or heard from the seller so I had to file a claim in order to get a refund."
2,"Mallory usually makes a good product, but not this one.","Was advertised as 300 ohm per foot cable when in fact actually 6-7 thousand ohm rated. The better 937 cable is 300 ohm per ft. My used, wornout wires measured about 6400 ohms per ft. Otherwise product ok."
2,Get The Way They Learn but not this book,"After getting ""The Way They Learn"" by Tobias, I was expecting (based on the description) some help on how to teach the different types. Unfortunately, this book really just restates what is already in ""The Way They Learn"" and doesn't add much in the way of implementing teaching to the styles described. A waste of money for the same info spun a little differently."
3,Getting by in Dutch,"I found this book helpful becuase it is not only a dictionary, but a pharse book as well. It is small enough to pack in with your suitcase or carry on bag. For anyone who does not read or speak Dutch, this is the book to have."
5,This was my first Engelbert CD,"I've always enjoyed Engelbert when I heard him on the radio, but for some reason I never even thought about buying any of his recordings. Then I saw the incredible PBS special ""Love Unchained,"" and went out and bought this CD. I think the reason it's so good is that the artist himself is in his prime. I know, they all say that, but just listen to him sing any one of these songs or just the first WORD of ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing."" The best part though is that this CD isn't just a display of Engelbert's talent, it's a showcase for beautiful arrangements that you never get to hear anymore and it's produced with attention to detail. Also, the order of the songs is seamless, you won't be hitting the skip button on your remote when you listen to this CD."
5,Sheer Beauty,"I have never been so touched by an album in all my 50 years on this earth. Having the PBS Special Video is a bonus. ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"", ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" & ""Stranger in Paradise"" are the most enjoyable renditions I have ever heard. What a singer, what songs, what arrangements, what musicians! Everyone who appreciates beauty should own this."
5,Engelbert's Best CD!,"Love all the songs on this CD! I too grew up listening to these songs by their original artist. Love Engelbert's version of them all, especially ""It's All In The Game"". Thanks Engelbert!"
5,Beautiful Renditions of Old Standards!,Engelbert's versions of these beautiful old songs is really great and a masterpiece. He just keeps getting better and his dynamic tremendous voice is so touching and gives one the feeling and emotions of the songs.
1,very unhappy about this product,I find it hard to believe that you would sell a product that contains information inferior to what could be obtained from any search engine query. This product is certainly not of any significant value. I thought perhaps that I just was having trouble opening its full contents but this is probably not the case. I was also dismayed to find that there was no way to contact an Amazon representative about my displeasure. I wondered why it was so cheap. Now I know.Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine: Venography
1,A useless collection of questionable statements,"This guy claims expertise he does not have. It is clear that this he thinks combining a mish-mash of disorganized facts and questionable opinions in an endless series of lists and bullet-points makes for writing a book. An example is his useless list of potential crime victims, including laughable characterizations like ""Business people -- vulnerable anytime, anywhere,"" and ""Police officers -- easily isolated and overwhelmed."" Another bizarre, casually-made and unexplained statement: ""The availability of weapons has nothing to do with the incidence of domestic homicides."" Or ""Drive-by shooting victims are generally children."" Huh? And the worst of it is these are not rare hiccups -- these disparate and doubtful claims are all from the same randomly-selected page. This book is a compendium of nonsense like this.One could learn more about how criminals think by watching an old episode of ""Knight Rider."""
4,Great source for beginning writer,"I highly recommend just about all the entries in the Howdunit series, and Malicious Intent is right up there at the top. Each book has a different author, some better than others. The information in this book is clear, concise, well-organized and planned out - like the perfect murder !I started buying these books in the hopes of creating a series of short mystery films for a web series, and they have all been a big help so far. They have been a big help in creating true to life characters and situations. I am looking forward to delving deeper into this volume to really learn how to make the villain right.Bottom line - if you are an aspiring murder mystery writer, these books are a great starting point for your journey !"
2,Biased Opinions?,"Prior to this book, I felt ""The Howdunit Series"" was 5-star. Malicious Intent was a disappointment! While offering good background information for developing a character's history, it seemed to me that the author had/has either ill feelings, or a lack of knowledge, about Christianity. Clear distinctions, in great amounts of detail, were made in attempts to get the reader to understand the intricate differences in so-called Pagan Religions. However, none was offered for any person whom the author felt was a ""Christian."" Simply referred to as ""Christian"" cults. In my opinion, it would be wise for anyone not familiar with Christianity (or other mentioned beliefs), to take the author's ""groupings"" with a grain of salt. I felt that several other belief systems were misrepresented, as well as my own. This biased my opinion of the book before I could get into the ""meat"" .. the profiles."
4,Two Headed Robot Animal,An accurate and colorful toy! Great for younger fans because it is very simple to tranform! Plus it shoots water!
4,Rock was named for him!,"Did you know that there was rockabilly before there was rock and roll? Rockabilly was named after the kind of music that the Dorsette brothers started. They would have a performance and most nights there was a fight because the crowd got so worked up by the hard driving edge of the Dorsette brothers music. Rocky and Billy Burnette started it all and this record will give you a great taste of the artist, Rocky Burnette who had a whole genre named after him! Before Elvis, before anyone else you care to name there was Rocky Burnette. Here is his music that will show you what rock really is and where it came from. Rocky wrote the music too which is important. That just wasn't done then but it shows how brilliant Rocky and his brother Billy were. Their songs were covered by Ricky Nelson, and even the Beatles as seen on the BBC recording. This rockin' record will Tear It Up and get you moving to see where rock and roll came from: Rocky Burnette!"
3,"A cult release, but only a beginning...","This was MayheM's first official release (circa 1987), and although it is an interesting listen, it holds absolutely nothing to their later efforts. Deathcrush is more of a Death/Thrash album with violent/gore lyrics...definately raw & brutal. But in the years after this album, the TRUE MayheM formed. And by the time they released De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas (the greatest Black Metal album ever recorded...PERIOD), they had already established themselves & the entire Black Metal ""scene"", which is still going on today. Deathcrush is what started it all, so it is definately a great release, but it was just a stepping stone to MayheM's immortal future."
2,"A classic because the band was, but avoid this recording","The early days of Mayhem shows mostly tuneless songwriting with cludgy, battering rhythm that achieves little more than Hellhammer although with enigmatic simplicity. Unless you are a Mayhem maniac and like their older stuff quite a bit, avoid this Venom-inspired primitive offering."
2,Harharhar,"This album is a joke. And I have ""De Mysteriis"" and ""Chimera"" and all of that other stuff, but the only good thing about this album is Maniac's vokills. Yes, Euronymous was terrible at guitar and so was Necrobutcher. Manheim was a very ""special"" drummer. In short, the vocals saved the thing. They saved it from being a total disaster. I don't reccommend it at all, not worth the money, not worth the time, don't get it, download ""Deathcrush"" from www.thetruemayhem.com to get the whole idea."
4,with no doubt the scariest release in its time,"i urge those who have this album to look for its printed lyrics. simple, straight forward and downright sick. probably the sickest ever...soundwise, there's nothing to do with the newer MayheM (the newer albums showed an infinitely better and more experienced mayhem)but it's a must. the riffs are efficient and easy to remember. and back in 1987 this was certainly the heaviest sickest and scariest stuff ever released."
3,For a client,I purchased it for a client (I am a mental health therapist). She has learned some good things from it. I rated it a 3 simply because I have not had time to properly evaluate it. I am satisfied that it contains material that I needed.
4,Nonpoint does it again,"This is the last Nonpoint album I needed to have all the albums. I'd rate it 2nd to To The Pain, which is outstanding. The ""In the Air Tonight"" Phil Collins cover is really cool. I wish they had more covers like that. This album sounds a little more like Statement than Development. One song is entirely in Spanish (track 5) but it is one of the best instrumentally on the disk. Nonpoint rocks again!!!"
4,Their Best,"this is NONPOINT's best CD. The best tracks are 'Done it Anyway', 'Move Now', 'Rabia (with latin feel)', 'The truth' and my personal fav. 'Peace of Mind'. There are a few throw aways on here, but it is much better than its predecessor 'development'.Though 'To The Pain' is decent as well, i think this and their debut are their best CD's. They are a good, hard working band. I highly recommend."
4,Well worth the wait,"Nonpoint's latest disc was well worth the wait and represents a sigh of relief after Development. For me, nothing beats their first disc, Statement, and while their sophomore effort was good, it was a bit of a disappointment.Not so with Recoil. This a great disc and shows a band whose song writing continues to mature. Elias Soriano's vocals have never been better and his lyrics continue to make listeners think. Andrew Goldman is one of the better guitarists out there who doesn't need to solo to show how good he is. KB and Robb Rivera continue to provide the band's thunder.I saw Nonpoint a couple of years ago when they toured with Hed pe and Spike 1000 and I can't wait to see them again. A great show and another disc of solid songs to add to their set list.If Recoil doesn't take the band to the next level, then not enough people know how great these guys are."
1,Dullsville.,This cd is extremely dull and boring and just about the worst effort the talented Miss Flack ever put forth. Stick with her 70's work over this waste of time.
3,"Orthodox, theological but a bit stodgy",The Tertullian portion of this work is rather old-fashioned and not very enthralling. It does contain a review of the misunderstanding often encountered on Tertullian's Adversus Hermogenem that Tertullian did not believe in the coeternity of the Son. However this is not enough to make it a necessary purchase. Not bad - just a bit too old-fashioned.
1,Fundamentalist diet guidance,"I did not enjoy this book - it is very ""Fundamentalist"", which is fine if you are a Christain Fundamentalist - however, if you are not, then it's probably not the book for you!"
5,Eva's Review,"This has got to be one of the best books I've come across that has every detail listed in plain black and white. Very understandable and helped me learn even more ways on Rituals and Celebrations. If you get any book, I recommend this one the most."
2,Meh... okay.,"Completely impractical. This book is not what I thought. It calls for items that would be impossible to attain in my area, and it didn't give any indication in the description that you need bogus stuff, like the heart of a bird. Blah. Not for me."
3,"Good Poetry, Bad Spells","This is a good book if you like poetry, but the spells are too old to be used by modern Witches. Many non-Wiccan Witches said it was good, but I am both a Wiccan and a Witch and the spells were useless, even the ones that weren't curses!Also, Valerie Worth (the author of the book) isn't even a Witch. She wrote this book because she likes poetry and she was interested in magick. This book get's 3 stars because it's good poetry, but the spells are useless."
5,WS3 Anti-Static Work Mat,This item was received on time in great condition. Thank you for your prompt service.
3,itll work,I truly expected something different i thought this was a foam mat like I had been using that grounded at the wall outlet and I'm not quite sure what this is. It grounds to the case and is impossible to keep flat.
2,Coconut Oil,"I'm not sure about the information in this book. I have been suffering from what I believe is Candida, digestive problems, eczema, acne, hair loss.... I used is oil in many ways. Took three tables spoons per day, oil pulled and applied to my very dry, eczema skin. So no improvement what so ever. My skin actually looked more wrinkled! Clueless."
5,GREAT BOOK - YOU MUST BUY THIS ONE!,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AND WAS AMAZED AT ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT COCONUT OIL CAN DO FOR YOUR HEALTH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AND ALSO TAKING COCONUT OIL DAILY. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
5,Coconut Cures,"This is a great book. I love it. I have learned so many uses for coconut oil. My skin looks better, my hair looks better, my finernails even look better. Everyone should read this book."
3,Interesting.,"As in all products that make big claims, I'll be in the process to find out if they are correct."
3,coconut is good,"Our minds were changed by this book. We now are looking for foods prepared with coconut oil.We see that diets rich in coconut are good for us. But, holding island people up as a reason to use it makes little sense because their life styles are so different from the western world. Is good health result of the coconut or being active as opposed to sedentary?"
5,Title says it all,"With its antimicrobial, antiviral properties, coconut should be in everyone's diet on a daily basis. Unfortunately, the beautiful coconut was given a bad reputation some years ago - just like the egg - but it was false. If you want to be healthy, learn how by reading this wonderful book."
5,love it,Great book still reading it and it is full of all kinds of all kinds of info that was not knownby me
4,Good Book -- Money Well Spent,"The author is very thorough. Each point is well explained. A great ""How To..."" book.Coconut Cures: Preventing and Treating Common Health Problems with CoconutIt has tons of preventative treatments as well as cures for all types of ailments. This book will assist the reader in making an informed choice. The only problem I had was finding enough fresh coconuts up here in the Northwest."
4,"Good, but his other book is better","This is a good book, so don't get me wrong when I say not to get it. I think his other book, Coconut Oil Miracle, is better and you should put your money towards that one. Virgin coconut oil is awesome!"
3,very informative but balance required,"I really enjoyed this book - but i feel a little more balance is required. The book explained many of the health benefits about coconuts and coconut products, but did not include all health information. Coconut oil promotes ketogenesis, and a ketogenic diet is not recommended for some medical conditions such as porphyria. I have this medical condition, and found out the hard way that coconut oil is detrimental to my health."
3,Some things I (don't) like about this product,"Some problems:- the forteManager software does not work on my computer;- I have problems switching between the digital/analogue inputs: the DVI cable has to be physically detached in order for the analogue input to register and work (admittedly, this may depend on what you are trying to connect, in my case it was a DIVX player);- the stand is not stiff enough - the monitor simply refuses to remain in certain positions, which can be extremely annoying.Things I like:- the picture quality;- fast response time;- the design."
3,"LG Flatron L1980U Ultra Slim 19"" LCD Monitor (Black)",Nice monitor but has some dirt specks on the inside which is able to be seen against a white background. There are no drivers for my 64 bit system.
4,Buy 2 copies and pass one on! Hyra & Bush are Amazing!,"If you like music this album belongs in your collection. Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush form the fabulous Billy Pilgrim. They have many solo and group discs (check out there website for indy discs). All of there albums are good, but this one and ""In the Time Machine"" are there best. If you like Freedy Johnston, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, or Tom Petty - I think you'll love this album."
5,These Guys are Awesome,I bought this album in 1994 after seeing them open for Cowboy Junkies. The Cowboys (...) but Billy Pilgram was GREAT. I have 2 of their albums and the sound does not disappoint me. I am not sure if they are still together but I would catch the act again if I could! Superb!
5,Thank god for Amazon & Youtube,"Without Amazon I would not be able to locate a ""used"" version of this awesome CD. I had the cassette but lost it years ago. You can even see Andrew Hydra on Youtube singing an acoustic Get me Out of here. For those interested Andrew is the brother of Meg Ryan and Christin is the male half of Sugarland. The name Billy Pilgrim is taken after a character in Slaughterhouse Five."
3,Shrill,"I like this because you can type in the exact time without going through pressing the same button over and over to get to 45 minutes.There is a clock setting on the top of the display that has a really small button. If the timer is not in use, it will go to the default time setting. I thought you had to push it every time to get to the timer setting, but you can just start pressing the buttons for the time and it takes away the clock.It is somewhat heavy, taller in the back than the front, and there is no magnet on the back. As a result, you have to have it on the counter. The display is small so you have to practically be right over it to see the time left. The beep is also nerve-wracking. It has a loud be-be-be-beep (4 beep cycle.) It is high pitched. It also sounds like the home smoke detectors. It scares me each time. I guess that is what a timer is supposed to do, but the sound needs to be less scary, loud, and shrill."
4,Caswell & Massey lavender shower gelI,"I have used Caswell & Massey products before--but not this specific product--and had been happy with the quality. So I decided to try a new product, and I am equally satisfied with the quality."
4,A very colorful and good introduction to the region's food,"Williams Sonoma is perhaps my favorite food store, and I was pleased to see that they came out with a series of books based on the United States regions' cooking and food. I was very interested in the New England book because of that region's specialties. The book looks great and has some very good recepies as well. I was interested in Molly Stevens's treatment of the fishing industry (particularly with codfish), and she does a good (albeit not deep) overview. For those interested in a deeper examination of codfish I recommend Mark Kurlansky's Cod. But I recommend this book for anyone interested in being introduced to the region's food."
5,"I wondered too, George...","Down here on the Gulf Coast, hundreds of people still make their livings piloting wooden power boats out into open water, staying a few days, and then coming back with holds full of seafood. I know some of these folks. They don't inherit fortunes to buy boats, they aren't millionaires stepping off into the latest trendy adventure, they're people who use boats, well and practically built, to make a living. George's book is about the Northwestern versions of these people and their boats. George asks why people like me can't find proper boats. Why people who want a good, spacious, long-legged cruising vessel but who didn't have a dear rich uncle or a winning lottery ticket to pay for it. Why forty feet should be $750,000.00. And he answers the questions. He answers well. He steps on toes which need to stepped on, and tells us that dreams can come true. He took my little piece of a dream and expanded it. What more can one ask of a book?"
4,Strange,"Anybody who does anything that remotely involves public exposure almost always can count on some sort of strange negative feedback. Bill Clinton is a prime example, but on a very lesser plane there is no better example than the ""review"" by Joe Snell, of my book. Mr. Snell who so far besides his mouthings about MY book, has enlightened us with his brief comments about 3 CDs, has chosen for some reason known only to him to make flip and ignorant statements about my book that I can only assume: 1) he never read it, or 2) knows nothing at all about boats. Giving him the benifit of the doubt I suspect 2). If this was 100 years ago I would challenge him to a duel for what he said. Today, the consequences of doing so, unfortunately, ain't worth it. But I want to state in rebuttal that PROVEN ideas are never ""antiquated,"" and, that inded the book goes into great detail about its subject. Cruising powerboats."
1,New book about old ideas,"This book is in no way a ""Guide to Crossing Oceans"" as the title implies.It is a new book about the author's antiquated boat design ideas for budget minded boaters. The book offers little to no information regarding what one needs to know in order to plan or undertake an oceanic powerboat crossing."
5,It opened my eyes.,"This book knocked my socks off because I knew what Bueler was saying but, well, I somehow didn't know it, if that makes sense. This book brought me back to earth. I love boats, the ocean, and being around them but I am bored with sailboats but never considered a powerboat. I hope and assume Buehler sells his designs because I want one. I don't know if I'll build it or not; probably not. There's plenty of steel yards around. If he doesn't, maybe I'll go buy an old troller and convert it because I remember, long ago, I thought about that. I remember that now, affet reading this book. I remember what I thought years ago.... Good show, Buehler. What will you write for us next?"
2,The Troller Yacht Book: A Powerboater's Guide to Crossing Oceans,"This book is primarily for folks who are thinking of buying, building, or having built a trawler and to take it on long cruises. This is not a book for those who already own a trawler and are trying to find ways to improve them and preparing them for cruising."
3,Living in the Past,Although technically correct the author has a 'problem' with the modern thinking in this field. This theme is recurrent thoughout his book.
4,worked well with pine and poplar,"This blade is a light duty blade i would not cut oak with it. well it is good for beginners. It did a really good job on the pine and poplar. i used it with a 2.6ah, 14.4V battery powered saw so i am not sure how it would perform on a more powerful saw. i just use it to cut stock 3/4"" thick or smaller. The blade is stainless steel so it is not going to cut like a carbide tooth blade. definitely good for small light jobs. i have the 24 tooth carbide blade and the plywood blade. i do projects occasionally so it is good for me."
2,"price is right, but no power","I have had more powerful pencil sharpeners that were battery operated. This one sounds like the engine is going to burn up, but on the up side, it doesn't oversharpen or sharpen up one side only. It does a nice job, just don't overtax it."
3,ECW Guilty As Charged 1999 review,"The opening tag team match between Danny Doring & Roadkill against The F.B.I(Little Guido & Tracy Smothers) was a usual stupid fun brawl to entertain the crowd. The Super Crazy-Tajiri match was tremendously entertaining. The John Kronus-Sid Vicious match was short but sweet. The Dudley Boys-New Jack & Spike Dudley tag team match was just a big messy brawl. The TV Title match between Rob Van Dam & Lance Storm was not great but pretty good and a nice finish to boot. The Stairway to Hell ladder match between Justin Credible & Tommy Dreamer was slow,boring and not as good as their championship S.T.H. ladder match at Heatwave 2000. The Worlds title match between Shane Douglas & Taz was a bad bout with tons of run-ins to boot. Not to mention,the 13 minutes of pointless brawling because they couldn't deliver in the ring. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10."
3,Grandma for fun,Easy to assemble but heavier then I thought it would be and takes up more room then I thought for storage.
2,Poorly built with cheap materials,I used to play table tennis with my dad on a regular basis and for several years played in a local table tennis club. I recently moved to a place where I have room for a table and decided to get one for me and my son to play on. This table caught my eye as it was built by what I thought was a quality company. I've never been more let down! I was immediately disapointed when I opened the box and found the corner to one table was chipped and the entire side rail was bent. Once I got the table set up I was even more disapointed to see how unstable the entire table was. For $600 I expected a lot more and will be returning this table ASAP.
3,Poor Product,This compressed-wood-board Table is sagging in the middle after a few month in the basement. Don't buy this table if it is being used in the basment.
1,This is an indoor table!!,"This table is listed in Amazon as an outdoor table. We learned the hard way that it is an indoor table. It got warped and the top bubbled due to moisture. Amazon has agreed to take it back, however, and change the listing for it. No where on the description from Amazon does it say it is an indoor table. As an indoor table, I'm sure it is very good. It is easy to assemble."
1,Run from Stiga - poor customer service - never get it together,Bought the T8611. Forget about getting it together. Poor customer service. Rude. Not helpful. Written insructions do not match the video on the site. Totally confusion. This company takes your money and runs. I lite it on fire in my backyard. RUN RUN RUN form these guys
3,Good reading,It was very light some missing important info about the history of Venezuela but to start it is very good.
5,Great company with excellent customer service!!,The book was in perfect condition just like the discription but unfortunatly it was the wrong book. The company took the book back no questions asked and returned my money. I have delt with many companies that I was impressed with but when a return is hassle free that is a company I would buy from again.. and again.. and again.
5,excellent,"Hard to put down. The German survivors of the Eastern Holocaust should have been interviewed to get their stories on film. Holocaust is a word of Greek, not Semitic origin, and means ""complete burning"". Best applied to what happened to Germany's best."
1,Unbearable,"Get Guy Sajer's book instead. This is one dry, repetetive and no so well written. I had to kick myself in the face to stay awake while reading this."
4,excellent personal account of the eastern front,"Brave men facing overwhelming odds against the Russian during the end of the brutal war. Under the point of view of landsers fighting bravely through hunger, bitter cold, and fatigue through an unrelenting barraged of Russian troops. Their sacrifices are so tragic that they made if for a Fuhrer who can never comprehend what valor and honor mean. This memoir give a very detail account of a soldier's life in the eastern front w/ vivid details of the horror one face in war. The only setback is there's no map detailing the movement of the troops and their retreat making a better visualization. Also it seems to be missing the flight, torture, execution, and slave labor of the Russian people. It would seem that as an officer, he would've witness these acts. So I am not sure if he just want to focus only on the military aspect of the war or avoid it altogether."
5,Monumental piece of literature!,"This is a fabulous piece of work! The narrative virtually placed me in the front! This book is read like a novel, yet what it recounts are true facts. The reader actually gets involved and perhaps believes he is living those horrific events!"
5,In Deadly Combat,"A superb book about the hopeless situation on the Russian front . Moves fast , loaded with action , even has a few gory pictures of some unfortunate Russian tankers that show how horrible war can be . Would make a great war movie ."
4,The best narrative of a German soldier that I have read.,"If you like reading what the other side was dealing with during WWII, this book fits the bill. It's one of the better ones of the genre. Bidermann's story is interesting and full of insights into the German soldiers experience. I recommend this book whole-heartedly. Bidermann does not make excuses for being a German soldier, or for his actions during the war, but just tells his story honestly, I believe.Enjoy."
3,Surprisingly good,"One of his lesser known albums has some jewels in them! From ""Love me like we'll never love again"" to ""If i could love you more"" to ""I could get use to this"" to ""Answered Prayers"" to ""Stay with me"" to ""Slide a little closer"" to ""There's no song like a slow song"". He seems to put his heart into these cuts and proves again why he is one of the greatest, smoothest, and purely honest vocalist of our time. I honestly believe Engelbert cannot sing bad and if he feels the song no one can sing it better. It is just a matter of the song meeting Engelbert's heart and then his magical voice takes us to a place few others can take us."
3,Very little prog from It Bites main man,"It you are into pop folk singer songwriters then this recording will be for you.If hoping to hear a little It Bites with their pomp/pop progessive rock influence, then look elsewhere.Not even any hit songs in the Chris DeBurgh territory."
4,TRUE LIFE INCEST AND MURDER,"Based on Janet Flanner's 1933 Vanity Fair article, MURDEROUS MAIDS (Home Vision Entertainment) vividly creates a sympathetic but unapologetic account of the notorious Papin sisters life when they are sold into servitude by their self-centered mother. Incest, murder and the haves vs the have-nots are at he heart of the most famous French crime of the 20th century. Memorable, insightful, artistic and chilling."
2,I don't ever want to see this movie again!,"As one reviewer said below, this is one movie you only need to see once...and once is enough! I don't know why I was able to stomach ""Sister My Sister""--another movie based on the same events--and not this one."
1,didnt work,"menory s tick gave a ""memory stick error"" message in my sony 707 camera the first time it was inserted into the camera..returning it."
2,Incompatable with so many things,"Yes, I can store music on my PDA (UX-50) sometimes. Big deal. The ""Pro"" is not compatable with Sony software, nor my new Sony television."
4,Good and cheap for a memory stick,"As with all Sony products, memory sticks are more expensive than they should be. Lexar does a good job of getting the price at par with other media like CF and xD cards. Its transparent body is nice looking, but useless because you can either look at it or use it. The green led looks nice when its being read on my Clie... except that also has no real use either because there's already a red led on my Clie next to the slot which glows when it reads the media. The alternating red and green looks cool though.This is a 128x2 MB stick. So you will either love or hate that you have to flick a switch. This also means that the 2 modules are a little less than 128MB, so overall, you would get more storage if you took a Sony or Sandisk 256MB memory stick. The switching becomes a pain when you are shooting MPEG movies with your CyberShot camera. That apart, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't buy it."
