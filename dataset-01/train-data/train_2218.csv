4,great movie!!!! sad that digital copy not compatible with itunes!,"I love this movie and I am a big fan of Michael Fassbender, but sadly this movie is not compatible with itunes. only android. :( oh well. a at least it's a good 20 bucks is a good price for the price i paid for. but fox needs to start having their movies compatible with itunes!"
3,WTH???,"I recently rented this movie and, I must say, I don't know what all the hoopla was about. It was just OK in my opinion. Maybe I need to watch it again, but it'll have to be free."
1,Seriously,"This movie is boring. Fine, I get it, he's a sex addict and his sister is crazy. But just cause you play deep serious music in the background does not make it so."
2,Weird movie,"This movie the story is not organized, you don't really get any out of them, I think most audiences probably only concentrate in sex part, overall it is not a good movie. I felt waste money to buy it."
1,Lousy and pretentious,"This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. Absolutely boring, lame movie about the life of privileged people. Maybe they think this is entertaining, but this is one of those films you will swear you've seen before. Just don't even bother. BTW, what man isn't like this guy? Give me a break."
2,Shame,"Character development was a bit sloppy. Also, the plot could have been conveyed with a lesser amount of graphicness. Sometimes it was graphic for graphic sake and didn't seem to lend much to the story line. This could have easily been created as an R rated film and still have gotten the same point across. I gave it a few stars because there were parts of it that were pretty good. However, overall, I think it was lacking."
2,A Shame This Wasn't a Better Movie,"""Shame"" attempts to be one of those arty movies in which long blank stares are a replacement for acting. Fassbender's character does 'wake up' towards the end of the movie in that respect but it's too little too late. We never understand what makes Brandon tick and no amount of gazing helps us learn anything about him. The metaphorical white walls of his apartment sure aren't any help; it says virtually nothing important about the character though we're to assume it does. [Note to the director: We've already been exposed to this cinematic trick, several times.] The movie is unnecessarily long too; Carey Mulligan's little song, for example, did absolutely nothing to advance the razor thin plot. Nor is the nudity central to the plot. This movie is also devoid of incidental music, which supposedly makes this story more realistic. Yes, well, sometimes real life is not always more entertaining than fiction. This one's a snoozer."
2,Is That All There Is?,"While the actors were brilliant, the scenes themselves were too long and drawn out...almost to the point of making me want to get up for something to eat or drink. Too slow-paced.In addition, I found a specific part or two to be a bit unrealistic. I'm very close friends with a sex addict. It's as if this film wants audiences to believe something tragic will cause pause in the sex addict's behavior. I personally haven't found this to be the case whatsoever.Michael Fassbender and his member are marvelous in their roles, giving incredible performances...but this movie just doesn't live up to the hype."
1,unacceptable dvd for my players,"I was unable to view the dvd. It was printed ""unacceptable for viewing"" on any of my three dvd players!"
2,I Don't Get It,"This is a typical addiction movie. It doesn't matter if it's alcohol, or drugs, or sex, these films always ends the same -- on a down note.I don't understand all of the 5 stars. It is a heavy drama that you can see the ending coming in the first 10 minutes of the film. You know every one is going to self-destruct. The screenwriter and the director should have given this film a different ending, a happy ending so we could say ""Wow, I didn't see that coming!""Two stars for the two moments that were not depressing. Although I can't remember which scenes they were."
2,"Awful, Hyped","I see a lot of movies, and many deal with the darker aspects of human existence. I've certainly learned by now that just because a film and its maker choose to deal with an unpleasant and ugly issue, that doesn't inherently give the film quality or significant meaning.I thought that this was badly made. It's generally more squalid than it needs to be, and it's hard to take seriously."
3,It's okay,"This film got rave reviews, but really, it was quite boring. I actually fast-forwarded through several scenes once I had a feel for the directing and realized that some of the scenes were insufferably over-long."
4,Compelling,Distrubing but accurate look at a sexaholic's life. It's obvious that both siblings grew up in trying times. Michael Fassbender was fantastic in this haunting role.
2,"Michael Fassbender is gorgeous, as usual... and that's one of the few redeeming qualities of this movie","The relationship that the brother (Michael Fassbender) and the sister (Carey Mulligan, who also does a great job, like usual) have is very similar to the one that I have with my own brother, which was interesting to me to finally see it from an outsider point of view. Other than that - WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE?! Other than the obvious and obligatory - sex scenes, work scenes, bar scenes, apartment/bathroom scenes - what did this movie aim to achieve? It seems typical of movies that are coming out over the past few years and currently - fantastic actors, lazy script. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it outright. I think it exposes addiction well; what made me annoyed was the choppy aspect of it, and how obligatory those choppy scenes seemed."
3,very cerebral,Watched this movie based on description only...should have read online reviews. This cerebral movie at time bordered on being a documentary. I'm sure it was a great 'indie' flick!
3,Shame,"This was nothing more than soft porn. Just a story about a man who was a sexual addict? Two very dysfunctional family members with no real storyline. I was a weird story, weird."
1,porn??,"Well basically a guy with a sexual addiction. . which he demonstrated over and over and over. . Didnt want to get to know his parts that ""well."" I have gotten rid of very few movies. . this one was taken out. . and tossed to the trash.."
1,Hard to describe when dark and quiet.,"The movie streamed from Amazon just like many others I have rented, but no sound or image, so it is hard to write an accurate review. :-/"
1,Not Pleased,I should've researched what this movie was about before I watched it. The theme was not appealing to me. I would not recommend this movie.
1,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen,"Where to begin? Do we care about these self absorbed idiots? Nope. Is there any character developement that would make me care? Nope. Is there a story line that makes any sense at all? Nope.So...what do we have? We have a really ""D"" rated sex film that was mass-marketed to the general audience. It is disgusting.Oh, if you like to look at female breasts...and fake sex scenes...well, then, this is the blockbuster for you.However...if you really had hoped to see a story about character development and a true story...well, then you had better skip this piece of junk.It is horrible.I seriously think Amazon should give ""zero"" stars...for total junk. I didn't even hate this film...it is totally worthless. Do not waste your time or money.""Shame"" on you, Steve McQueen. Disgusting."
2,"Dumb movie about self-pitying, self-centered hetero jerks","There must be a demand for movies like this, since they get made. There must be people who like movies like this, since they get good reviews and win (or at least get nominated for) awards. Maybe the good reviews convinced me to watch this movie, but it was a mistake.This movie is stupid and irritating. The story is stupid, and all the people in it are irritating, self-centered, self-pitying jerks. Who cares if such obnoxious people are unhappy? Besides, they're all straight. No wonder they're all screwed up: they're trying to have sex with the wrong sex. How could that make anybody happy?It's time to take a break from watching movies when I start watching dumb, irritating movies about heterosexual angst like this one."
4,Michael Fassbender is incredible!,"If you're a Michael Fassbender fan, this is a great movie to see his skills in. It's a sad story, but he really plays all the intricacies of if sooo well. It's got a good supporting cast, but I could not stop thinking about what a job Fassbender did with this material!"
2,Aptly Named,The Shame in this DVD is I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life watching it.The main two characters are sadly disfunctional and I spent the whole film wondering what the point was.It never really became apparent and I found the film dark and depressing. No insight was ever given into why the two siblings were so disfunctional. their downward spiral was gloomy and incredibly sad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I bought the Blu-Ray and have subsequently thrown it in the rubbish as I would not want any of my friends to endure it.
3,This one can be summed up pretty quickly - beware of spoilers***,"For all the verbiage being used to describe this film, there isn't really much going on. That is not to say it doesn't hold your interest, but there is quite a bit of repetition here. Start with a dysfunctional brother and sister combo, add lots of meaningless, empty sex, an inability to achieve true intimacy with others and an implied past incestuous relationship which sort of explains all the dysfunction.Rinse, repeat, add a failed suicide attempt for good measure, the end. One gets the impression these 2 had quite a troubled childhood. One scene that stood out for me as a great example of the excessive nature of this film is an agonizing, long, boring, rendition of ""New York, New York"" delivered by the lead actress. Not a bad voice but we understand the irony of the performance almost immediately but it seems to go on for another 5 minutes beyond that."
1,Region 2-does not work on my DVD player,I waited a long time to get this only to find out that it does not work on my DVD player. Waste of money
1,Audio,"Good quality and although I loved the Special Features but the audio wasn't accurate, it's way off. It ruined the movie for me."
5,Wonderful CD,The Mckameys are a wonderful group and they seem to live what they sing. All of the songs are very uplifting. Keep on singing. There's not enough of good gospel singing in the world.
3,Fox?,"I said it wasn't very educational, because it does not really look like a fox. I purchased it for a child whose name is Fox, but he couldn't tell what it was--it really looks more like a squirrel. It is also brown. It is cute and fun to play with, though."
3,What Comes After The Cha-Cha Slide?,"I purchased this CD because I wanted a copy of ""The Cha-Cha Slide."" I listened to a preview of each of the additional cuts prior to ordering the CD, so I knew exactly what I was getting. If you love ""The Cha-Cha Slide,"" you'll love the first two cuts on this CD. But unfortunately, that's all that this CD has to offer. For me, it was still worth buying."
2,Great Dance Steps,"I work in a child care facility and my staff were looking for the words and music for the cha cha slide. They were teaching the children so they could perform it at their preschool graduation. Well let me tell you it was a hit and the parents even joined in.Ever since that night, the other preschool classrooms wanted to have some fun too and I let the other classrooms listen and dance. My only concern is that I don't get to use it too much because it is always on loan. I wish I had more copies! Thank you for helping my staff keep their children learning fun ways to listen,exercise, share and socialize with others."
1,"Awful, horrible, monotonous, (expletive deleted), etc.",Duhhh!! Did anybody notice that every song on this CD sounds the SAME!!
1,Is this a joke?,"I can't believe that 20+ people have given this album positive reviews. The Cha Cha Slide is one of the worst albums ever created. Just listen to the music sampler if you dont believe me. My friends downloaded this song as a joke, and play it really loud at parties so we can all laugh. Anybody who likes this type of stuff probably likes the Macarena too. And anybody who likes the Macarena has a serious mental illness. Download the Cha Cha Slide if you want side-splitting laughter, but if you actually buy this CD, consider yourself on the absolute bottom rung of the musical world."
3,I can dance to it,"This is a good CD if you are putting together a good dance CD. This was not the version of the Cha Cha Slide I wanted, but I did like this version and do not regret my purchase."
3,CHA CHA SLIDE,"This is a great song (the cha-cha slide) for young girls. My daughter has been a cheerleader for 3 years and she is 9. This song helps break the tension or shyness between other girls on her squad. It is great if your child may be overweight, she (he) could use this song as a cardio exercise.I was at the San Diego Sports Arena for competition with about 7,000 other cheer squads. During intermission this song was played and 90% of the cheerleaders were dancing to the steps of this song. Now my opinion is if almost 7,000 girls liked it than use your own opinion. I like it, It is better than watching my young daughter dancing to ME AGAINST THE MUSIC W/BRITNEY SPEARS."
5,Really Good,I love the cha cha slide. At the dances i go to they play it like 2 times per every dance. There is about 300 people that go to those dances and everyone dances to it. Me and my friends love it and im hoping to soon order the cd offline.
2,Too old to sing,"In his prime Julius LaRosa was the best. However, this album, a late rehash of his classics, fails to deliver. His voice, while familiar, has lost much of it's passion and strength. If looking for the ""old"" LaRosa, don't look here, get the original recordings instead."
3,Review of Eh Cumpari,I was plesantly surprised to find this particular item as it contained songs I remembered from my childhood. I was very happy to add them to my music collection and share my memories with my children. It brought me back to happier and much simplier times.
3,almost perfect,"This is almost an ideal receiver. I have 2 problems with it. First, there are not enough video inputs. I had to plug my PS2 in through my VCR since the only video in are VCR and DVD. That knocks off one star. The other star goes because my display window slowly stopped working. At first I could tap it and the display would work again, but finally it just quit, and this happened in less than a year. I'm sure it's a fluke - everyone gets a bad egg once in a while."
5,you rock,"Wow dude, your music is like so kewl. I especially love track three. I want you all so bad!"
1,Don't bother,This tape won't teach how to skate; it's only a video showing how great some kids skate and that's all there's to it.
4,Few days of fun and a good result,"I had a good time putting this puzzle togehter. It is a moderately challenging puzzle especially the sky, mountains and the forest areas of it. Took me about a week of spending a couple hours a day to put this together. THe only thing I didn't like is the pieces don't lock together so it's hard to move a fixed piece to a different work area."
3,Missing pieces,I enjoyed putting this puzzle together -- BUT was very disappointed that TWO PIECES were missing. There is no way that I lost these two pieces as I kept the puzzle confined to a large board in the dining room and it (the puzzle) was never moved. The number of almost indistinguishable black pieces proved a tad tedious but the distraction from daily stresses that the puzzle provided made the process of putting it together ultimately worthwhile.
1,Worst Puzzle Ever - Not Fun at All,"This was my first Ravensburger puzzle and I absolutely hated it. It has softclick technology which means the pieces lock together so loosely that you cannot pick up a section of the puzzle without having the whole thing break apart. This puzzle has few colors and it was not a good time. I purchased online. If I had seen it in the store I would not have bought it. The pieces are small, do not snap together snugly and are a general pain in the but. I will not buy a Ravensburger puzzle again. I am very disappointed with this puzzle."
1,Product does not match with the picture,"I am very disappointed,because product does not match with the picture.Picture's Beaver Cuddlekins in Amazon have whiskers,but Product didn't have whiskers.[...]More lovely picture of product."
4,So real!!,"It's a very special toy, it looks very real and I believe it's hypoallergenic so if you have childrens with alergies problems, don't worry, this kind of toys won't harm them. Also you'll be doing something good because part of the earnings to this toys support the work of several reservation areas, that take care of this type of animals.The person I gave it, love it... so I think it's a great toy!!"
1,tiresome and toothless vamp mystery......,"This supposed erotic vampire mystery is soft on mystery and wooden on erotica. The ""love scenes"" between the main characters play out worse than a Penthouse forum entry. They are so bad I'd almost swear this book was written by a man as the female lead has NO personality except for being a convenient receptacle for the male leads lust. No story, no heart, just raunch disguised as a mystery. Totally skipworthy. no stars."
5,A painful but wonderful introspective exercise.,"I find that I agree with all of the positive reviews, but indeed what most haunts me about Mutis is his deeply introspective writing style. I read the book in Spanish (my native language, btw) and the language is enthralling and personal... If you took away the background, most of Macqroll's fears and feelings are rather universal, and as you read the book (especially that WONDERFUL! first chapter) the book becomes an introspective exercise, made bearable simply because Mutis takes you there with the gentleness of his writing, the magic of the geographical settings (and their descriptions) and the company of the most human and flawed characters (Ilona being my personal favorite)."
2,I just couldn't get into it.,"Our ""hero"" was too much in his head--philosophic--with too little action or anything interesting going on in the first chapter or two, so I simply put the book down and never picked it up again. The book may have gotten better as it went along, but good books usually capture my attention from the beginning."
3,doctor in the publishing house?,"It is densely written and discursive . . . relentlessly so, for 700 pages. Perhaps you will find this poetic, profound, or even titillating. Perhaps not. Perhaps, instead, you will think that Mutis is a brilliant, verbally gifted man in need of lithium and a good editor, or both. In all fairness, he gives plenty of warning up front. Page 17: ""Our mistake is to think it's going somewhere, . . ."" Page 19: ""makes his sentences difficult to understand until we grow used to the rhythm of a language intended to conceal more than it communicates."" Page 20: "". . . filled with long, rambling circumlocutions that made no sense."" I think this award winning ""emperor"" is feeling a bit chilly, but laughing his chillies off."
5,The best $15 you will ever spend!,This book offers amazing results. This book cures any pain in the body and goes beyond bringing you to optimal health.
1,Not worth time or money,"I was completely disappointed with the Egoscue method. I have two herniated discs and had a severe flair-up when I got this book. I read it right away and followed the exercises religiously. I got absolutely no relief. I am very active and play sports, so the only thing I think this might help is people that are not active and those that don't take part in any exercising at all. In all honesty, I can't see how doing things like squeezing a ball between your legs or laying with legs in the air helps anyone at all. Don't spend the money on it."
2,unorganized hodge-podge,"Even though some of the exercises appear to work, finding the correct one to use is like wandering through a department store. For example, an exercise for back pain shows a picture and instructions and refers the reader to a previous chapter where the same exercise is pictured but a different set of instructions are included. I will not buy any more of Pete Egoscue's stuff"
5,It works!,Egoscue's method cured me of an intractable back pain in six weeks. I have recommended it to many people who later told me it helped them also. Highly recommended.
4,Userful,"Egosque's thoughts and plans are very logical and make good sense to me. The writing is clear and the logic is clear. There are lots of pictures of the various exercises, and the explanations are clear. Good book easy to read and to use."
5,great,My shoulder and lower back has had issues and pain for years. I have been using the exercises in the book and I am feeling better each week. My chiropractor told me about this book.
3,After Long Term Use,"I have practiced the material in this book diligently for the past 8 months, and I think that sets me apart from the many who review this book after shorter use. The methods described in the book offer short-term relief positions for those in pain from musculosleletal problems. They are not unique, as yoga and physical therapy help in a similar fashion. They did not cure my back/disc related pain. Egoscue's claim that 95% of people doing these excercises will recover in a week is absurd, and his theories, though interesting, are unproven. Who is to say that his ""successes"" would not have recovered naturally in time? Having said that, I do think the book can give comfort to those in pain, but don't expect a cure."
5,Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain,"Received my first book of Pain Free while in physical theraphy. Egoscue theraphy is excellant. Had past previous books on to friends, just re-supplying my library."
4,Excellent for the basics and some exercises I wish I knew about long ago!,"The author was suggested by my chiropractor - the book was the one I chose not knowing which one was best for me. This is a great starting point to have some quick relief to persistant low back and shoulder pain. I was able to immediately perform the majority of the simple exercises and the text description and example pictures makes it fool proof to apply his exercises. One tip I can offer is to pay attention to how to align yourself during some of the floor stretches - as a former massage therapist, the alignment described, if accurately followed, provides a significant impact. If not, results may vary. It is simple so just pay attention and start getting better. I am looking forward to the arrival of Healing Through Motion! Enjoy"
5,"Pain Free was worth $60,000","I learned about Pain Free from a MD on the faculty of the George Washington Medical School.My daughter had had a chronic shoulder pain for about three years that prevented her from working, school, or any significant activity.She wore a back brace for an entire year to correct scoliosis problem (that cost me over $30,000). Spent countless hours (and dollars) with chiropractors, physical therapists, and message therapists.As a last resort we went to GW medical faculty for alternative medicine. The doctor told her to read PAIN FREE -- and call him if it didn't work.HER PAIN WAS GONE AFTER FEW SHORT WEEKS. I'd still have $60,000 -- if I had read PAIN FREE FIRST.I'M NOT KIDDING!!"
4,Interesting and helpful,"Some of the exercises (static back, sitting floor) provided in this book have helped me a lot with my lower back pain and as I am a dancer and fitness instructor I've seen them help many of my students as well.Also on the plus side, the book provides a few good tips on posture.I wont give it 5 stars, because I would have liked to learn even more new exercises, instead of seeing so many yoga exercises in there, like cats breath or downward dog.All in all, an interesting read and a good value for $."
5,Pain Free,Amazing and the exercises really and truly work ... not only for me ... for many others as well! Changing my life on so many levels! Another book I'd recommend for every household!
4,Pain Free,This book contains solid information for those who suffer from chronic body pain. It has been tried by many including myself and has helped to improve our physical condition.
5,Pain Free,"One of the most informative books I have ever read. If you follow Dr. Egoscue's procedures, you will be ""Pain Free."""
5,The Bible for Pain,"It's a miracle that I discovered the bookPAIN FREE. I consider it the bible forPAIN. And everyday, I feel less and lesspain! Bravo to the author Pete Egoscue!"
4,A starting block,"Great book to begin taking control of your pain...simple, easy to follow, anyone can use the method no matter how old or infirm."
5,Great Book,"I have been plagued with plantar fasciitis for years. After doing the exercises in this book for 2 days, the pain has already subsided and I am able to run 10 miles again without pain. The concepts are straight forward and make complete sense. Would recommend to anyone with pain."
3,Pain Free book,This book was very informative. It contradicts everything you were ever told about posture and the physical pain that come with having bad posture. These are very simple movements that make subtle changes with real relief but I read this before going to an Egoscue clinic. I have gotten some relief where as I know people that have had great results. One man told me it saved his life.
5,Brilliant!,"This book has been a lifesaver - it provides a very sensible overview of the body's biomechanics and includes discussions of the possible conditions which give rise to arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as pain-relieving 'e-scises' which are immediately effective. I have done a lot of reading in the last year and no other book has come close to the usefulness and wisdom I have found in this book."
5,Get Free!,"This book only works if you work it. Honestly. Read the first three chapters then go to the section that applies to you. Always drink lots of water and breathe deeply, several times a day, at your breaks, before and after work, do your part to improve your health, you only have one body, treat it well. Remember, eat live (fresh organic produce and fruit),to have life."
4,Informative and easy reading,"This book has lots of easy to do exercises (positions really, not exercises) that make a lot of sense. Descriptions and pictures are very easy to follow. It provides a whole new and logical way to think about getting your body back into a healthy state. I'm really looking forward to continuing the suggestions. It promises a lot. After a few days, I do feel better."
4,Simple...and it works,"No crazy exercises or props...just simple, easy things to do that really help! I have only done the postures (not really exercises) for the shoulder. These are things I know from yoga and physical therapy but this book simplifies into something I can do when I watch tv and just before bed."
5,Full of great information! Lasting results!!,"And best of all, you can do it in the comfort of your own home for FREE, once you buy the book for $10--which isn't bad compared to $10,000 or more in medical bills!! With pain and problems left over! I disagree with the author only in that he believes our wonderful bodies evolved over millions of years. He knows much about the body and has great understanding and insight into how to allow the body to TRULY FIX many problems (more than just skelatal!) I'm saddened that this knowledge has not yet led him to the Creator of our amazing bodies. [Psa 139:14] I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well."
4,Real-world advice from a professional,"This will supplement any M.D. and physical therapy visits you may be getting on your own. Well-illustrated exercizes. While my Dr. thinks TMJ (look it up) is microscopic arthritis, Pete Egoscue claims its almost entirely bad posture. Regardless, those in chronic pain should look at this book. Many good chapters for ""all"" body parts."
5,Terrific,The methodology in this book eliminated my lower back pain on thefirst day. You must continue the VERY easy exercises until the musclesand joints are correctly aligned but I am now pain free.
2,ok content in bad wrapping,"""Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain"" by Pete Egoscue is a timeconsuming book to read, because of it's extremely boring and messy layout. As most american books, the information is carefully hidden behind far too many unnecessary words. That's ok, scrolling throug content is easy. But, since this is a book that covers a number of different health problems, you obviously do want to start reading the most relevant parts. That seems easy at first sight, since there is a content list. But even if the advices seems to make sense, you fall asleep before reaching any conclusions."
2,"Good exercises for some people, but are not uniquely Egoscue","These same exercies can be found in Yoga, Pilates, Back Care, Abdominal Classes, Pre-Natal Exercise and many more fitness classes.It sure beats sitting around, but let's be fair. The benefits can be achieved by exercise in general."
2,Fad exercises,"These exercises are good for people with a lot of spare time, eg. pensioners. One has to do at least twelve exercises which take too long to complete. The ""supine groin stretch"" takes one and a half hours(45 minutes each leg). The ""static back"" takes another 30 to 45 minutes. Others are very hard to perform eg the ""air bench"". Finally some exercises are common hatha yoga asanas eg ""downward dog"" and ""cats & dogs"".Mr. Egoscue makes a number of claims about his method which remind me of the incredible claims of Chinese Qigong ""masters"".I would not spend so much time for some exercises that may not work at all."
5,Egoscue is a genius!,"I was brought to the hospital, barely able to walk. The MRI revealed two herniated disks (neck and lower back) and the doctor suggested a surgical proceedure. By following this book's advice re exercise, my pain diminished about 50% in one day and was virtually gone within the week. With minimal upkeep, the pain has not returned in over 5 years."
1,Pain Free,this book does not address the specific pain issues we required it for and i would like to return it.
4,Recommended to my patients,"I am an occupational therapist and a certified hand therapist who works in a busy outpatient clinic. I had 2 different patients recommend this book to me, one of which actually bought it for me. I was a little skeptical, even though I am pretty open minded. I am a physically active 36 y/o who occasionally gets low back pain and most recently some neck stiffness. I've used the exercises on several occasions and after a day or so the symptoms always seem to subside. I'm not saying it's the answer for everyone, but it's definitely worth a look! I've even recommended to a few patients."
5,Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain,"This book was a present for my mother in law. She desperately wanted it because her expert 'Rolfing' masseur considers it her 'bible' using and recommending it all the time. I personally have not read it yet, but my mother in law has. She has done many of the exercises recommended in it for her type of back pain. She has felt much better and she loves it! For what I saw it looks like a serious but easy to follow type of book, it has very clear and specific explanations for many different types of chronic pain. After she will finish learning her routines I will give it a try!"
2,not achievable ideas for handicap person,not achievable information for the handicap person and would not recommend it to others. Unrealistic goals. You need to be physically fit to do the recommended exercises.
3,Interesting,Interesting to read about. Nothing I would rave about. May help some people but not what I was looking for
3,NEED TIME,"Method is so time consuming it becomes a chore and no time for other types of excersise .....gym. Information is clearly stated and most informative, but layout is confusing."
2,Did not work for me...,"If this method worked for some people, that is great! I hope it works for you! It's worth a try.However, I wanted to say that it does NOT work for EVERYONE. It did not work for me. I spent an hour or more a day doing the exercises, and in addition to buying the book I spent around $300 for official Egoscue therapy (with a therapist). The exercises the therapist gave me actually made me hurt more, so they re-evaluated me and gave me different ones. They did not make me worse, but neither did they help.In all fairness, no one else has been able to help me, either. I've had 2 MRI's, 1 nerve conduction study, 2 ultrasound exams, 2 ultrasound treatments, 2 physical therapists...I've been to 2 chiropractors, 1 medical masseur, 1 acupuncturist, and - a partridge in a pear tree!Good luck! I'm not saying don't try this, I'm just saying it does not work for everyone.The book is well written and his basic premise - that we just don't move our bodies enough! - is sound."
5,Works brilliantly,"This book has a very simple premise: that optimally calibrated motion, not simply exercise, is the key to pain-free existence.I've used the exercises in the book for a month now, and my chronic neck, shoulder, and write pain have diminished greatly. Whereas most regimens emphasize strength and relaxation, this book emphasizes that proper motion may require different muscles and different motions than you may be used to. In particular, you may have to retrain your body to use the strong, latent muscles that a sedentary lifestyle neglects.A masterpiece, simply put."
5,Finally Relief After 15 years of low back pain,"I highly recommend this book. I was at my wit's end trying to get relief for my lower back pain which started 15 yrs ago (I am 54). I've been to 3 chiropractors, tried stretching exercises, lost 30 lbs, bought a memory foam topper for the bed, but the pain gradually got worse. I'd wake up every night with painful back spasms. I even asked my husband to switch sides with me in bed since I could only sleep on my left side with minimal discomfort. Then a friend recommended this book. The FIRST NIGHT I experienced significantly less pain. I've been doing the E-cises every day for the last 3 wks and I feel so good I can hardly believe it. My friends say I look 10 yrs younger because I'm getting my sleep. I spend almost an hour doing the E-cises. If I skip a day, the pain returns, so I make sure to do them every day. Do yourself a favor and get this book."
2,poor bleeder valve design,"Having used these devices in the past I was reasonably impressed with the quality of the arm cuff, stethoscope, and pressure guage, But the simple but perhaps most important component, the bleeder valve on the inflator bulb, is so poorly made to make the unit almost unusable. After inflating the cuff with the valve closed, which works fine, attempts to adjust the valve, so as to obtain a gradual drop in pressure to give time to make the necessary measurements of blood pressure, results in the pressure dropping so quickly and erratically that a meaningful measurements are almost impossible. After looking closely at the valve's construction, this wasn't a faulty valve I happened to get, but one that is simply not of a quality needed for this type of instrument. If they put a decent valve in this unit it would be a good buy.ronomr"
3,Below average,I bought this bp cuff hoping it'd be simple stupid...unfortunately no! The bleeder valve frequently ejects from the bulb sometimes in the middle of pumping!!I think the measurements are accurate when all the parts are where they belong:)
1,Horrible,"I was excited when I received this in the mail, but after opening it and trying it, I was thoroughly disappointed. The large head of the stethoscope produced no sound at all but the small head worked fine. The sphygmomanometer wouldn't work when I tried to take blood pressure. It leaked and the needle never bounced. Overall, horrible product. I sent mine back the next day."
3,"Stethoscope is a piece of crap, Sphygmomanometer works fine.",The Stethoscope is absolute crap and not worth anyhting. Had to use the baby side of it to barely hear anyhting and couldn't even hear my own hearbeat through my shirt. Bought a real Stethoscope and its like going from wearing ear plugs to being able to hear. The Sphygmomanometer seems to work great.
4,PERFECT,"Got this for the hubby who is a phelbotimist for American red cross. Their colors are dark blue to this fit in perfectly. He loved having his own and loved this product. Not to mention that it was so reasonably priced, Thanks guys."
1,a challenge!,"My husband chose this product because it is what he used professionally. However, he could not easily hear my heartbeat with this stethoscope. It now sits unused on the shelf and I bought digitalized one locally. This is my first failure on Amazon purchases so I am not complaining about them."
4,"quality is good, works fine","i paid 27usd and wanted to buy 1 more for gift but now it costs 39 however.quality is good, works fine, maybe 27$ is good price but 39 too expensive."
2,Stethoscope was missing,"The stethoscope was missing from the package and have to wait for one to be additionally sent, clear incompetence from whoever is packaging this item."
3,"Lovely colors, good quality","I love the colors for this set. All the items seem to be of good quality. My only complaint is that I have a difficult time hearing with the stethoscope. I will probably buy a purple version of the Littman stethoscope to replace the one that came with this set. The blood pressure cuff is sturdy, velcro is extremely strong also! Plus the everything fits nicely in the carry bag."
2,Problem with stethoscope,"Cuff and pressure-reading instrument were good quality, and price was fair. However, the stethoscope would not consistently transmit sound unless the tubing was in a fully elongated position. This made it impractical and necessitated return. Unsure if this defect was unique to my item or more pervasive."
3,Do not get the kit,"I'm very disapointed that the sthetoscope in the kit does not work as well as I spected; you can't hear a thing! , so if you need one I recomend that you should get it somewhere else, on the bright side the sphigmomanometer in really easy to used...."
3,Prestige Blood Pressure Kit,"The kit was okay, except the stethoscope doesn't perform as well as my old stethoscope. I switched diaphrams in the kit with not apparent improvement. So I am using the kit with my old stehoscope. The cuff works fine."
4,Exceeds Expectations,WOW! The quality of this product exceeded my expectations. Naturally for the price I was ready for a light weight unit and received a model that the university med-students envied. As the Senior Advisor to a Silver Sneakers Program the purple coordinateS beautifully. I would recommend this to anyone with a small budget in need of a professional quality sphygmomanometer and stethocope kit. THANKS BIG TIME!
4,Good product,Prestige is know for the good quality products they provide. The hunter green color was very nice.
4,Hmmm,"Everything with the cuff and stethoscope was okay except I think there was a leak with the blood pressure cuff. Whenever I pumped up the cuff, you can tell by the guage that the pin is slowly coming down. But if you're looking for an inexpensive cuff and stethoscope that gets the job done I'd stick with this one."
2,You get what you pay for,I bought this set for a nursing class but ended up returning it the same day. The stethoscope was extremely uncomfortable but it worked well so I thought I could deal with the pain for one class. Then I took out the cuff and straight out of the box the gauge was at 22psi. So I just boxed it right back up and took it down to the post office. Amazon was good about getting my refund quickly.
2,No D Ring,"I bought this to check my own BP when the rubber bulb on my current unit oxidized and started leaking. This unit does not come with a D ring, making it nearly impossible to get the cuff secured on my arm. That might not be an issue if you're using it to check someone else's BP. Also, the stethoscope was a little tricky, and not that sensitive. Am returning it."
3,"ok, not too bad","decent price for a decent product. I've previously used the same model from a friend, I didn't like how the valve is too tight, but when I got mines, it was fine..."
4,Much Better than Retail Price Deal.,I think the STETHOSCOPE works quite well. I read some reviews that said otherwise. It turns out the long metal tubes which feed into your ear rotate and twist to the desired angle. { Hold it in front of you like you are going to put it on and simply twist each of the metal tubes about 45 degrees in the appropriate direction. This allows the black ear pieces to angle slightly away from you. Then gently bend the metal ribbon which holds the metal tubes together so that it exerts less pressure on your ear canals. THIS WILL INCREASE THE COMFORT AND PRACTICALITY OF THE SYSTEM A HUNDRED FOLD. } Your Welcome.The SPHYGMOMANOMETER works well too.
5,GREAT for the money!!,"I just needed something to learn on, but for the money I don't think you can get ANY better!"
1,unsatisfied,the meter wasn't tarred to zero so i had to return the product.amazon was prompt in handling the return and refund.
3,Prestige Sphygmomanmeter & Stethoscope Kit w/ case,"This kit is nice, but I don't recommend it for professional use. Works great but you can't hear that well with the stethoscope."
2,Poor quality,Cheap. Taking a bp with these was very difficult because auscultation was so difficult. Buy a better product and get your moneys worth.
1,lousy purchase,"The product proved to be unsuccessful, could hardly perceive the sounds and the velcro not performed its function properly, really disappointing"
2,Weak.,"Perhaps she is a fairly new author and future books are bound to get better. I found her story depressing of course, and also a bit weak. While teachers and friends try to discover why Justy never talks, nary a word or concern about this upsetting condition comes from her parents. A bit hard to believe on that score. Generally, depressing through and through. I also found it unlikely to believe that a child of Justy's age could think at a level of such maturity. All of the characters were a huge disappointment, altho that was perhaps the authors intent. I am not trying to be overly harsh - I think Charlotte Gullick has it in her to write a more profound book."
2,No Longer Cool,When UP IN SMOKE was first released it seemed to be a very funny movie for its type. Since then times have changed and it now has taken on a dated appearance and its slapstick humor has begun to look quite sick.
1,Dreadful,"I go back a ways. I had lots of the Cheech and Chong albums on vinyl back in the 70s and enjoyed them immensely. But I was never interested in their movies. When Cheech starting appearing in movies on his own, I found him amusing, so I purchased Up in Smoke out of curiosity and nostalgia.I'm probably in the minority, but I found this movie stupid and boring. It has one or two funny moments, but it consists mostly of a long, rambling plot that rips off some of the material from their albums and actually manages to make it NOT funny. The Battle of the Bands segment is the most boring sequence of any film I've seen in years. Awful.Rent before you buy. You may even feel ripped off that you paid to rent it!"
4,we loved it,my daughter had never heard of these guys so I rented the movie for her and she loved it. Funny
1,cheeh and chong,cause i cant play the movie it skips. then freezes waste of money on that one i though they were all tested
5,High level comedy!,This is a must see for everyone who loves a good laugh.Tears ran down my cheeks many times during this movie as I laughed. I hope all their other films come on DVD some day.
5,A REAL MASTERPIECE FOR ALL TIME,"This 1st movie is a century classic, most of all scenes are very authentic and 1st class starred by Cheech and Chong and also by the various actors playing within this film - 2nd scene of Chongs father telling his son Anthony to look for some work, while Mama is doing talking rap in the background, i can look at on and on and it will stay fresh and funny forever - Brilliant also is Stacy Keach doing the Sgt of the Police bunch with codename Hard Hat is just fantastic - The film was very well done, and scenes were chosen very well, when you look at the deleted scenes in the High-Larious Edition, they would not fit so well in the movie, as the ones taken - THIS FILM STILL IS A CENTURY MASTERPIECE !!! SO GREAT !!!"
5,one of the best!,"this is my favorite Cheech & Chong movie! this was a pretty happening movie at the time when it came out... one of the few movies (at the time) that featured punk rock bands before punk became commercialized! I watched it on Instant video, but I think I'm gonna buy the DVD!"
2,Cheech and Chong's Comic Time Capsule,"When ""Up in Smoke"" premiered in September 1978, straight and stoned patrons laughed hysterically at the cinematic debut of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. Seen today, the film survives as a period piece - terribly uneven and less amusing with the passage of time. Stacy Keach makes an excellent foil for Cheech and Chong's pot-laced antics, but the duo's albums were much funnier."
3,Not as funny straight!,"This movie was a whole lot funnier when I was a stoner...if your still a stoner, then by all means buy this movie, you won't be dissapointed....the funniest part is right in the beginning of the flick when they are cruising in a car smoking the biggest fatty I have ever seen....a classic stoner scene, not to be missed.....don't even bother buying any other Cheech & Chong movie, because this one is the best, which ain't saying much!"
5,..Buy It...,"man, this is one of the funniest movies... Could stoping laughing. It hurts.. pass the chips....."
3,well organized but hard for freshmen,"This book is well organized and full of examples, but it's will be better to explain more about the math operation and what does it means in the real world."
4,An Informative Book,"This is an interesting book that really brings you into the mind of a Jewish child living during the Holocaust. It tells the story of an 11 year old boy named Alex who lives with his father in the Warsaw Ghetto.One horrible day, Alex's father leaves and Alex is forced to live in a bombed out house on 78 Bird Street. There he must learn how to survive in the always threatening conditions. Until his father returns, Alex must always be on alert. The main character's bravery and courage is inspiring to all who read this book. At times it could be a bit dull, but over all this book was wonderful. Anyone who loves to sit down with a good book should read The Island on Bird Street."
1,Inappropriate,"An adventure story set in a ghetto???? Wiesel said that a novel about Auschwitz is either not a novel or it is not about Auschwitz. This is not a novel about life in a ghetto, this is fantasy at its worst - it makes it possible for those who do not know about the Holocaust to think it was all a great Enid Blyton adventure."
5,Read it!,"This book is one of the best German/Jewish war books I have ever read. It reminds me of The Diary of Anne Frank. READ the book! You will love it, I promise:)!"
1,My advice: call Dish Network,"The consumer comes last at DirecTV. The last time DirecTV changed the cards in our receivers they sent a DEFECTIVE product. The rep in tech support told me the first round of MASSIVE FAILURES occurred weeks after the cards were shipped. Despite the hundreds of calls from irate consumers, the company refused to issue a recall. Now they are experiencing yet ANOTHER round of failures, but management stubbornly refuses to issue the necessary recall. I thought corporate America had finally learned the importance of customer service; I stand corrected."
1,Never again!,Neon moves far too fast with far too little instruction for a normal human being. You HAVE to either (1) know belly dancing at a high-beginner to low-intermediate level or (2) be able to read her mind.I do not recommend this workout!
4,great gag gift,we still get laughs today! great gag gift for a friend and for a girls night out! love the collection
2,Dissapointed,"I got these in and they looked like fake jewelry. I wish I had chosen else, a lesson learned for future purchases."
4,good gift,it is a great product for that very special person. they say good things comes in small packages...well this exemplifies that.
2,"Earrings are gorgeous, backs and packaging bad.","The earrings came in a cheap looking blue cardboard box and a tiny black pouch made out of crummy velveteen.They were gorgeous, and I absolutely adored them... until the back fell off of one and I had to trek back through O'Hare airport to find it on my previous plane over the holiday. I replaced the back with a different one, and thanked my lucky stars...Vacation came and went, I went back to work and lo and behold, the same thing happened with the other earring; of which I hadn't replaced the original back. This time I wasn't so fortunate- and I haven't found the earring.My advice, replace the backs before use. If giving as a gift, also repackage."
1,"Beautiful earrings, but way too small","...These earrings are very beautiful, but too small for an adult--they are child-size. The briolette is the size of a teardrop! I returned them for this reason. (Amazon: you should consider posting an actual-size photo for all jewelry.)"
4,"Perfect, except for the backs","These are beautiful! Just the right size, very elegant and lightweight. As another reviewerd commented, the backs do not stay on very well. I replaced them immediately with my own rubber backs.They have just the right amount of dangle, and are not too long or too short."
4,It isn't bad,Well i like the part where Mc Solar rapps but Missy Elliot keeps repeating the same thing it si okay but i have heard better songs.
1,Overly Polished Album Destroys Mason's Wonderful Voice,"The selection of songs are emotionless and does not show the true vocal quality that Karen possesses. ""Hello, Tom"" lacks the feeling that it originally had and void of powerful emotion. The two songs that save this album are ""I Haven't Got Time"" and ""Better Days"". Even an album of dediction requires a better performance than simply singing second rate songs of Brian Lasser only. I would skip this one and hope Karen comes out with more comtempory songs and really shows what her voice is made of. It rivals that of a Goddess and should have been shown here."
1,I slept through it,A whole bunch of hooey....constantly contradicted itself. I reall liked the fat English woman who looked so scared telling her part that she looked like she was going to cry. Good only for a laugh at bad documentaries
2,JVC has done better,"I bought this receiver with the intent of upgrading my home theater system and replaced my first JVC receiver model# RX-207 (it still works and sounds great), and I was under impressed. Since I have had previous experience with JVC, I already knew lower end JVC equipment tends to have good sound with the mid and high ranges but less desirable sound with the lower range, as was the case with this unit. I prefer to let a self-amplified sub do the work instead (both car and home stereo).My biggest complaint was the center channel. No matter how much I adjusted the balance and sound, it sounded ""boxy"" and most dialogue was difficult to understand. Fortunately it blew out 2 months later and I replaced it with the JVC RX-8000V (I am much happier now). I give this unit 2 stars and the 8000 4 stars."
5,The Best,"I LOVE this book. However, i might have to say that you won't obtain much out of this book without a good understanding of Heat Transfer and thermal fluid sciences in general.Data for an extensive list of surfaces are presented in both graphical and tabular form thus giving you the opportunity to graph the same results without having to estimate the coordinates for each surface. Several topics are covered and also present their graphs and tables that have proven to be useful for many of my undergrad projects.If there were anything I'd criticize it would be (actually 2 things) to have the graphs amplified and to present the results in tabular form along with the graphical results for the expansion and contracting coefficients. I say this because it would be a lot easier to write out an algorithm for compact heat exchanger analysis having these results already in numerical form.Buy this book if you really like this topic."
5,compact heat exchanger,i wanted the design of air cooled unmixed type of heat exchager for refrigeration system
5,You don't want the European version!,"This is perfect for those of you who own the 1st season box set. It's a cliffhanger that leads up to the series. The Euro version is irritating. The ending seems thrown together because it was. It's worth renting, but not owning. This one is great. FYI - I bought this on [web site] for $..."
2,audio problems,"The Video on this is okay, but the audio is horrible. There's phase cancellation throughout the disc. I'm not sure if you understand, but when the wind would blow through the trees it sounded like steel on steel! It's very annoying to listen to.I was waiting for it to be over and I'm a huge Twin Peaks fan. Buyer beware on this one. Wait for the real thing, save your money."
1,Keep watching your old videotape copy.....,"Total waste of DVD format. The soundtrack has a wicked flange to it, especially in the quiet, atmospheric moments that make the show. The video is also sub par, with very little contrast when the scenes get dark, again a major part of the show. After seeing the Season One special edition, this thing is worse than your videotape recording from when it first aired, the one that you've watched a million times. Be patient, and hopefully they'll do it right."
4,A must have for Twin Peaks fans.,"If you are a Twin Peaks fan, you must have this 2 hour pilot episode. Although I recommend getting it by buying the boxed set ""Twin Peaks Gold"" which has the whole series and the pilot episode. This pilot episode I purchased is excellent in picture quality, but the soundtrack sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. If the soundtrack was not a problem, I would have given it 5 stars. I have heard the pilot episode that is included in the Twin Peaks Gold box set has a remastered version with no problems at all. I already had Twin Peaks season 1 and 2, so I purchased this pilot episode separately. If you are buying the whole series for the first time, get the Twin Peaks Gold box set, and avoid the tin can soundtrack of the pilot episode sold separately.Adam Link"
4,Not that bad.,"After reading all the negative reviews I was a little skeptical of this disc. Actually, it's not that bad. It played fine. Dolby sound was good with no hum. The colors are a little washed out compared to the season one set. Not that bad."
3,"Bad sound transfer, but better than nothing","I have the pilot on VHS and on DVD, and both have issues (the VHS has one spot with sound problems, the DVD has the oft-mentioned metallic-sounding noise with the treble, though the pacing is okay, with no ""chipmonking"" or playing too fast). It's a shame that if someone is going to go to the trouble of making a DVD, that they don't get a good sound transfer out of the deal. I suppose doing it right is too much to ask? Until the pilot is released as part of the series, I suppose us folks in the states have to take what we can get. I just wish they'd hurry up with seasons 2 & 3!"
3,still a stunning story but with awful quality,"Twin peaks remains one of the best tv series ever so it's a shame that the image and sound quality of this dvd are very, very poor. Image quality looks like a bad videotape copy, and sound is just horrible. (sounds like a very badly encoded mp3 file)What I also don't understand: The dutch edition of the twin peaks first season INCLUDES the pilot episode, at GREAT quality! Apparently there IS a good quality pilot episode out there somewhere, and I wonder why they don't release it separately? (and while I'm at it, what's the story on the second season? why don't they release it?)"
1,Twin Peaks Import DVD,"Well heres the dirt on it. Its a very good dvd because its Twin Peaks. The Pilot. The episode that started it all. Its just a shame that this is the only way to get the origanal pilot. Its in sped up Pal format so its a little speedy talking and music.The origanal is 96 minutes, and this has been sped up so much that now only rns 90 minutes. The picture quality has that grainy, color bleeding look of one of those old sitcoms on the BBC. Definitly the worst quality I've ever seen of a dvd. Lets just put it this way.....I would complain if I bought a VHS tape that had picture quality like this. $29.99 is a bad price for this disc, unless you are a devoted twin peaks fan. 1 star for quality, and 5 stars for the actual pilot episode."
3,The sound is bad,"Sorry, but I can't agree with the review I read here. The sound is really bad, mostly coming from the front speakers and is somehow metallic, artificial. It's certainly not to be compared with the fantastic region 1 series box."
5,An amazing kickoff to the series,"I just received a copy of the pilot episode yesterday and was thrilled to see it after almost ten years! Visually beautiful and brilliant in design, the DVD has just one flaw. The sound isn't nearly what it could be. I still give this an emphatic five-star rating because of how fantastic the series is. The sound seems to fade and it can seem a bit scratchy at times. As far as I'm concerned, I can get over this one small hangup and love it just as much as I did when I watched this show with my Mom every Tuesday night at 9PM, 15 years old, intrigued, entranced and scared out of my wits! The ""Twin Peaks"" experience is not complete without the movie that started it all!"
3,Best thing until the official Region 1 comes out...,"The video quality is actually quite decent... As with the other reviews on this page, my main problems are with the sound being a half pitch off. It's very distracting...but the video quality is good.Anyway, a good story is still a good story. I don't think this DVD will disappoint on that account."
1,disgruntled of england,"twin peaks.what can i say! mybe one of the most oustanding surreallist comments of a generation, but feeding on extremely realist subject matter. a master piece; of scriptwriting, direction, acting. lighting --- name it, it was/os magnificent.WHY IS IT ONLY REGION 1WHAT HAS DAVID LYNCH GOT AGAINST THE REST OF THE WORLD?when will it be released on region 2?and for the amtter, when will we get to see mullholland drive?"
3,"Well, at least it's a DVD...","It's true the video and sound leave a lot to be desired, sorry to say. Mine seemed to have a slight sickly yellowish overcast that had me grabbing the TV remote and playing with picture settings most of the time but I wasn't able to get the color to look the way it should. But with VHS on its way out I wanted to have a DVD copy since it was available. Nothing exciting in extras here either. Keep you chin up though, the First Season set is fantastic and will make your heart sing."
1,Horrible Audio - Wait for a Better Version on DVD,"I am a huge fan of Twin Peaks, but this DVD is terrible. The audio is out of sinc with the film, i.e., you hear them talk, then see their lips move. It was painful to watch. Even though I think the Twin Peaks pilot is one of the best things ever to have appeared on U.S. television, I have only watched this DVD ONCE because the sound is so bad. There is talk of a ""definitive"" version of Twin Peaks coming out in October 2007. Hopefully it will include a remastered version of the pilot. If it doesn't, buy the UK version of the first season, which includes the pilot, unlike the US version. But whatever you do, don't buy this."
5,What's the big deal? It's just fine.,"I read the reviews, and ordered the DVD. Evidently I am not the audiophile the others are who had issues with the sound. The picture was not discernably better or worse than watching regular television. The sound was fine - we have surround sound and tried it several ways - switching speakers, etc., not because it was poor audio, but because I was trying to hear what the problems were. Couldn't tell. The bottom line is, it's the pilot for the series, and if that is what you want, then get this DVD. It is that simple."
1,BAHAAAHAAAA! THEY ACTUALLY CHARGED THIS MUCH FOR THE PILOT!!! I KNEW THEY WOULD!!!,"When I made the decision to buy Twin Peaks from Amazon.uk, people said I was nuts. I had to go out and buy a new dvd player anyways, so I got one that adapted to European Dvds. I told people they were planning on ""trying"" to sell that pilot for as much as the season itself.Lo and behold! There it is. These guys are rip offs! I'm going to wait for the next season and buy it from Britain as well. It's a real shame we gotta get ripped off from our own country.Johanna"
4,Alone Across the Artic,"Excellent true story, well told with many explanations so the reader understands what is going on."
5,"GREAT, great story!","This is a great book that will inspire you to be a stronger, more adventursome person than you might otherwise be. I like the way the author incorporates diary entries from her expedition, and also the text inserts including helpful background information that might otherwise have bogged down the flow of the story. I bought both this (the version for adults or teens) and the companion book, Big Enough Anna, which tells the same story in a manner appropriate for young children. Both are fantastic, and I plan to give copies to friends as gifts. Way to go, Pam Flowers!!!"
3,Not the OEM Product,"Great value, but I did not receive the Canon GPR-6 OEM cartridge as pictured. What I got looks like a refilled cartridge. I bought this from Shoplet, via Amazon."
5,My Favourite Goodbye,"Ash O'Halloran keeps herself busy with her catering company and spending time with her cat, Bagel, but as a young, unmarried woman wonders if perhaps she should be living her life more fully. When she caters a proposal dinner for one of her clients that doesn't go quite as expected, Ash can't help but wonder if this client, Dan, will play a larger role in her life than she initially signed on for. On top of that, she also has a millionaire vying for her affections. In one way or another, Ash's life is about to change in a big way!As usual, Sheila O'Flanagan tells a touching and humourous story filled with memorable characters. No complaints, a wonderful summer read!"
5,Best MJ's For The Little Feet,"I love these shoes! My daughter started wearing her first pair of Glow's in size 19 (when her feet were still very chubby -- she was barely walking at the time) and she is now in size 23. These shoes have always had the best fit and look, compared to similar shoes by other brands. We've only had the suede version, and it cleans well and looks great even after extensive daycare wear. One pair was accidentaly washed in a washer with the diaper bag, but it still looks great! The decorative stitching on that particular pair is partially gone, but I blame the washer (since it's our 5th pair of Glow's, and it has never happened before). Overall, I think these are the best toddler Mary Janes, so stock up, if you can, because this style is now discontinued."
3,Not a good fit for wide feet,"These are adorable, well-made shoes, but they just didn't fit our 2.5 yr old's wide feet. Unfortunately, we had to send them back."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this Auto B Good. The programs built on each other, but are not in the right order. A the main topic, war and dying to protect others was lost on my little ones (4yrs) and there was not even a comparison with Jesus dying to save us. Just missed its mark. We won't watch it again, but I will get another DVD to replace it."
4,"""Raising Victor Vargas"" is too real to judge as a movie...","Sometimes you come across a piece of filmmaking that is SO REAL and true-to-life, it seems as though it were ""reality television"" instead of a ""written for the screen"" type of work. This movie is SO pure and lucid in its adaptation of hispanic family life, it's scary. The love and closeness among siblings that border upon idol worship, the fanatical religious matriach who is the heart and soul of the family, the machismo of the developing hispanic male...just everything...every little nuance is very carefully articulated and represented in such refreshing simplicity that it is a pure joy to watch and is as famaliar as apple pie or in this case, ""pernil"". Loved this movie and would recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates independent filmmaking at its best...when it just ""IS"" and not necessarily trying to be a commentary on life."
3,pretty good film,this film hits home if you had a hands on old school grandmother who was direct about things. there are alot of Complex issues at work through the film.the film deals with various issues&doesn't water down any thing.it's a decent film.
2,"I can't believe I made it thru the whole film, awake!!!","This film is enough to put anyone to sleep. On;y the gorgeous Melonie Diaz(who plays an ugly duckiling here), and the Grandmother's odd behavior keep ones attention. The charcter Victor Vargas has no personality, and yo can't really get into his charecter, because he doesn't have one. Like I said the Grandmother's odd demeaner and the fat sister make this film interesting. Worth one watch, if you have absolutely nothing better to do or watch. Personlly I'd rather watch TBN!"
1,Best flimsy film of 2003?,"How on earth was this film rated best indie film of 2003? I had to play cards just to keep myself amused.I almost stopped the video to watch CSI on TV ( yes, it was that bad), but perservered in the hope that it (or victor) may redeem itself. Alas, it did not. Boring, but at least it was short."
4,"""compelling and rich""","I completely enjoyed this movie. It wasnt fast paced, but never seemed to lag. The realistic storytelling centering around urban youths reminded me of ""Kids"" and ""A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints"". The acting was natural and compelling, and the story carried the weight of intensity without being violent. Not large in scope but just a collection of really good acting performances which made me forget about the camera."
5,Absolutely Irresistible!,"Definitely one of my favourites. Hunt has created a wonderful protagonist in Willie Smith. Willie is a marvellous character, beautiful, loves make-up, warm, loving and simply irresistible.His life as a harlot with a silver lining is touching and heart felt. The background of the story, depicting the slums, the wealthy, is richly crafted. Disappointed that the book is out of print but grateful that I have a copy. Because of Sweet Lavendar, Hunt is now one of my must-read authors."
2,Agh,"Its hard to believe these are the best science fiction stories of the year. Where's the sense of wonder? I don't know, call me old-fashioned, but many of these stories are chosen, I think, for political reasons by editors who were chosen for political reasons."
1,Proof-read by a three year old?,"The quality of the proof-reading and editing almost defies description. Shame on Amazon for selling this book in this condition. Stories are good, but puh-leeze have some check the text first."
4,Works for me,"This seat protector meets our needs in that it is a good size and color. It shows the lint, otherwise it would be a 5."
4,Nice quality,This is a nice pad. The quality seems good (I have not washed it yet) and the brown color is very nice looking.
5,Nice Looking Protection,We received this last week and are very pleased by its softness and good looks. We might by another for the other recliner in the house.It's a good value.
3,adequate,"Does protect the upholstery, Tends to hold the unpleasant odors even with washing. Does not stay completely in place in my Mom's recliner as she moves around. Blue color is a good match for her recliner. Appears to be holding up well so far to repeated washings. We ordered two so we would have a fresh one at the ready. Good price."
4,Good Quality,"Although I would recommend this product, I prefer the tartan plaid pad because it stays in place better. This pad holds up after washing well. Quick delivery."
3,Seat covers scrunch up,"I bought 2 of these to use on upholstered chairs. They are only as big as the seat, no overlap to keep them in place. They scrunch up when he sits on them and therefore not all the chair seat is covered. They are absorbent and no unsightly. Worth what I spent. I would like them to be a little wider so they could tuck in around the cushion and stay more in place.Americare Portable Seat Protector, Brown"
4,Very good item!,Product does what it claims to protect your furniture. Easy to launder. Really is a must for those with leakage.
4,Bought multiple colors!,This seat pad should be owned by everyone who has a relative experiencing incontinence! Pull ups are not leak proof; and thisseat protector has saved me from having to shampoo my mother-in-law's recliner multiple times a month! I bought 10!
3,Waterproof seat protector,"This product is waterproof and looks great. I only gave it three stars because the velour catches on my mother's clothes and won't stay on the chair. So, we have gone back to the disposable type. They slide around more easily and make it easier for her to sit and stand."
4,What a chair saver!,This seat pad should be owned by everyone who has a relative experiencing incontinence! Pull ups are not leak proof; and thisseat protector has saved me from having to shampoo my mother-in-law's recliner multiple times a month! I bought 10!
2,What a disappointment!,"Poorly written, poorly produced. I was certainly expecting more than this! My youngest is agitating for a Chanukah bush, and I wanted something to reinforce the idea of sharing others' celebrations and appreciating them without having to adopt them ourselves. That message is the only reason this little DVD gets two stars instead of one, because it does support that. However,I'll be donating it to the Sunday School library rather than bothering to watch it again."
5,"Oh oh, it's magic!","A lot of things have changed since I was a kid but these Scotch refillable dispensers and Magic tape are the same old-school quality they've always been. I've been using them for decades and never had so much as a blip in quality or consistency. I've tried other brands but they're either too gummy or not sticky enough or turn yellow over time. There's a reason adhesive tape is commonly referred to as ""Scotch tape""--Scotch sets the standard and has never let me down."
2,Problem Box,"You have to hand it to RCA. Their warranty for parts and labor is 90 days. Mine lasted exactly 95 days before it started to have problems. Won't turn off, set top buttons don't work, unable to access program guide menu, skips channels, etc. It is still useable, but it has lost many of the capabilities it had when it was working properly. This has happened to a couple of people I know. RCA was not alot of help. After speaking with them, I figure it is probably cheaper, and less of a hassle to buy a new receiver than return this one for repairs. I will be looking at Hughes or Sony for replacement.In terms of the satellite picture, it is very good. In my area, it is definitely cheaper than cable. I have found the Direct TV people to be pretty good with changing packages, questions on services, etc."
3,RCA - Good for the first 90 days.,"I have 3 receivers in my home. Two are the DRD420RE. They were both bought new from a dealer/installer. Both boxes worked fine for a few weeks. One has been replaced (RMA'ed within the first 90 days) and the other has constant frame and sound lock-up, but is outside the 90 ""very"" limited warranty.RCA does not stand behind their products very well. The current (October, 2001) replacement fee for this box direct from RCA is (...). And what you get back is refurbished. Very interesting that you can buy a new one here for (less).RCA's warranty only lasts for 30 days for full coverage and 90 days for partial coverage. Partial meaning that after the 90 days, you pay to replace your broken box.Other than the fact that these boxes don't last long and RCA has terrible customer service, I do enjoy my satellite. I use it daily and love it more than cable.I think that next time I might try Phillips or Sony."
2,My RCA receiver broke right after the warranty period,"I have two RCA receivers in my house. The first one started to have problems after a few months - the remote went out and the reception freezes and pixelizes frequently. DirectTV has a replacement ""program"" cause they have been getting a ton of calls about this problem. RCA refuses to recognize it.I love the satellite service but would not buy any RCA product ever again."
4,No problems,I've had two of these RCA 420RE's for about 18 months now and have only found one problem with them. The thing I found was that the remote works best with fresh batteries. When the batteries start going down some buttons may not work. I find the menus easy to use. I have friends and family with other receivers and I think the 420's menus are as good if not better. After reading the other reviews I will be knocking on some wood though.
1,item useless had to throw away,Unable to use talked with directv about getting it hooked up for over thirty minutes to get item activated. eventually just so unhappy threw the item awy
1,receiver rca drd240re obsolete,"RCA receiver DRD240RE is obsolete per directv tec support ,directtv will not activate this receiver"
1,not that good,"i have 3 of these in my house, part of a package that i bought at radio shack, and i've had 2 of them brake already, i don't relly on RCA products, since this has happened. i love the directtv programing, but not the equipment!"
1,What is this?,"I ordered this CD, fully expecting to discover a rae gem from the classic British Indie band, only to hear some rather bland lounge music. The songs all blend into one forgettable mess, and the lyrics are so asinine, as to make you tear your hair out. Recommendation to avoid."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"I agree with the March 2, 2006 reviewer. Beware when you purchase this ""remastered"" version because the sound quality is so low, that you almost have to cut your CD player up to full volume to hear some of the tracks (hence the idea of remastering is to give you better sound quality not worse). I find the bonus material to be acceptable, however, and the additional remixes are fine as well (if you are a fan). Just don't understand who in the quality control department, (or why even Lionel himself) let this one fly, because volume wise it is absolutely terrible. I am curious if the single disc remastered version is any better."
2,Not super;More like kryptonite.,"I have been a fan of Peobo Bryson music since his first album onCapital records in 1977. I do NOT have this cd nor do I want it.It has 3 hits. ""Beauty and the Beast"",""A Whole New World"" and""Can You Stop The Rain?""The first two songs were terrific crossover meterial but showcase the voices of Celine Dionand Regina Belle more than his. The rest of these songs maysoundpleasent but were not hits. For the real Peabo buy the Capital records anthology and the Electra records ""Straight From The Heart""which featured ""If Ever You're in My Arms Again"". Maybe Electra will release the singles from his albumswith them as an anthology. And they should throw in""More than Everything""his duet with Roberta Flackfrom the ""Live And More""album.Roberta was the live and Peobo was the more."
2,when the entertainment ends,"This is local cowpunk from a band that usually does better. Singer Ron House (local record store owner and punk veteran) annoys many people with his whiny, you-thought-Jello-Biafra-was-bad vocals--but this is the first time he ever started annoying me, too. And the usually terrific slashing, sloppy guitar work of Bob Petric is mostly wankery here (ironic wankery, but wankery nonetheless). Only things really listenable are ""Half Off,"" a great little ballad Ron's been doing solo for a while, and ""When the Entertainment Ends,"" a smart potshot across the multimedia bow (""When the entertainment ends/That's when the fun begins""). Don't wanna bash a great band for a bad disc, though--their earlier effort, ""Bait and Switch,"" is among the best releases of the '90s. Yeah, by anyone. Why Ron House isn't in Garth Brooks's shoes, I don't know. Bet he even has a suitable belt buckle.--J. Ruch"
1,sick book ever.,Daniel is very sick man. Would be publish it if the pictues belonged to his religion. This shows he has no knowledge of any religions and sentiments.The book contains blasphemous pictures of deities shown in the nude in various compromising positions that would hurt the sentiment of every human being regardless their religion following any faith.
1,In poor taste,"As other reviewers have noted, had anyone done the same, depicting the Prophet Muhammed (Peaces be upon Him) in copulation with anyone, there would be hell to pay.Daniel Herwitz should know better, given his supposedbackground on the Indian diaspora. I would question the judgement of anyone who could call such pornography 'art'.There are some very sickening and highly inappropriate drawings. It is important to note that this is the same MF Husain who openly declared that he has fantasized about the various Hindu deities.However, writing bad reviews will not stop or remove it from the marketplace.There are online petitions and efforts within India to get it banned. If you wish to have it removed from the face of the earth, it is best to start there. I just hope that it doesn't fuel the fire and make it popular--like what happened with Salman Rushdie."
3,It Ain't So Bad!,Thes here album has done me a world a good through hurtin times and through potty training with my son. I remember the good old days. Hal...
4,Very enjoyable,I bought this album because I enjoyed the movie and because the vocals are by Sweet Honey in the Rock. I remembered this all female African American group from my childhood and am glad to find that they are still as good as ever. Their unique style of a capella harmonizing can only be compared to The Fairfeild Four and it never disappoints. I'd recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music that is off the beaten path.
1,Disappointing,The content is not worth the price. You will get the same information from any tourist brochure for free.
1,Not so happy with this RCA,"The gadgets are cool, the picture is good but I can't recommend it. I started having problems with it within the first 90 days of purchasing it. It was under warranty, so it was repaired at no cost to me. (By the way, there's no such thing in-home repair. That just means they cart the TV to the shop for repair instead of you carrying it yourself!)But the worst of it is that within a year, (apparently) the same problem is back again. At least it looks the same, BUT now the warranty has expired! Needless to say, this is not a good record!I had a Zenith that was almost 20 years old and a Magnavox that is 13 years old. Neither have ever had to be repaired. But this RCA needs repair twice in less than 1 1/2 years! So, if you're really considering buying one, purchase the extended warranty coverage-- you'll probably need it!"
3,"Item not ""Like New"", as advertised...","Item was listed as ""like new"". When I opened it I saw it has pink crayon scribbles on the first few pages. The back pages and back cover are bent ot folded. Somewhere around page 245-260, the pages have a brown food/beverage stain on them.The book can still be read and I have kept it, but it should not have been considered ""like new"". Perhaps. ""good"" or ""acceptable"" at a lower rate."
4,Good undergraduate text,"This easily read book goes over the basics of quantum chemistry. It is designed for the undergraduate, and it is not acceptable for any graduate student."
2,For beginners only,"I disagree with the above assertion that this book is suitable for a graduate course. This book is the strained peas of the electronic structure library and is unsuitable for anyone with experience in the field or basic math. Levine's book is a better place to start, but far too thorough on the math. McQuarrie is at best 'cute', and certainly not worth more than $40.I personally think the ESQC Summer School course books are the best thing available for learning quantum chemistry. Ultimately, though, all roads in QC lead through Ostlund and Szabo. If you want to learn ab initio, get Ostlund and Szabo, then read Parr's book on DFT. That should get you up to speed."
4,Quantum Physics for the Non Physiscist,"This is a great introduction for Quantum Physics. It is not nearly as rigorous as the Physics books, and is actually enjoyable to read. I recommend reading this before taking quantum physics, or concurrently."
5,Great Father's Day Gift,Overall comment is it is really a nice book. The recipes are fairly simple and generally have common ingredients. A lot of cook books ask for some weird stuff that you have to drive across town just to get. I like how the author gave variations to some recipes. I also really like each comment beforehand. It gave a more personal touch on each recipe and something perhaps the reader could identify with. I have been to Turtle Creek Mansion in Dallas so that was nice to see plus the recipe from Hawaii.
5,WHAT A GREAT BURGER BOOK!!,"I consider myself a burger expert and this book is nothing short of pure genius. It is well written, includes beautiful photos that are guaranteed to make your mouth water and incorporates simple, yet delicious recipes that will stand the test of time. If you dare call yourself a carnivore (and even if you don't) than I whole heartedly recommend you order this book. You will not be disappointed."
5,Yummy Burger Book!,"What a fantastic cookbook! It has inspired me to create all sorts of wonderful burgers that I never imagined possible! This book would make a great buy, well for just about anyone."
4,Great Read,"This book is a wonderful resource for any couple that is in the ministry, whether they are newcomers or have been at it a long time. It gives insight into the thoughts and feelings of both pastor and spouse. I appreciated the thought provoking challenges that were given at the end of each section."
4,Encouraging,My wife and I have been involved in pasotoral minsirty for the past twenty-five years and found great encouragement within each chapter. Married to a Pastor is a great rescource for those who are just entering the pastorate or for those of us who are seasoned veterans. The content within each chapter is relavant and defines the privileges of serving the kingdom through the pastorate. It's a must read.
3,"Sounds good, but looks like a bootleg...","Like others have noted, the disk loads as an AVCHD instead of BD. I'm not an expert in all of the various studio authoring methods out there, but the disk does not visually appear to be a Bluray disk. The data side of the disk has a deep blue color similar to a blank DVD-R, and not the stamped silver that is common with professionally published disk media. Also, the label on the disk feels very similar to the etchable Lightscribe disks where the DVD burner can also create the label. The case booklet looks cheaply printed on thin paper stock. It too looks like it was printed on a low resolution laser printer.The sound quality is very good however, and is a DTS HD 7.1 at 96kHz/24 bit as advertised.So all-in-all the data content is what I expected, but at best this is cheaply published media, at worse a bootleg that somehow got into Amazon's merchant stream."
2,This item is not a Blu-Ray,"I disappointed with this item, this is item is sold as blu-ray but inside of box appear a DVD-R. I wrote to AMAZON to this and they send to me again this item.By second time when i recive this in inside of box appeared in dvd and not blu-tay.I don't know why the description of item is referred to a blu-ray.I do not recommend."
5,"Very Comfortable, Well Constructed","This table is incredibly comfortable. I would dare say you could even sleep on it! It's well constructed and strong, easy to put up, take down, or adjust. It never creaks or sways no matter how large the client is. It was well worth every penny!"
3,"acceptable, but a little disappoited","The 3"" foam is comfortable, yet the whole table is kind of heavy-too heavy to carry around.The head rest is not so easy to adjust the height.Plus, seems 28"" W is enough for us."
4,Great Product,"So far, this table has been excellent. No real complaints. It's big, so it can be a bit awkward to carry around, but that's what you get with a table this size and made of wood. I only wish there was a better way to store the face donut, but that's just nitpicking. In general unfolding and re-folding the table can be a bit awkward as well, due to the table size. It only has plastic feet on one side, but it would be better if it had them on both sides, so you could safely put it down on either end. I give it 4 stars because of these small issues in setup and tear-down, but once it's set up, it deserves 5 stars."
5,Very nice table,"I was very surprised at the quality of the materials and craftsmanship of this table. This table is very well designed and it is very stable. I really was not expecting this table to be as nice as it turned out to be.It is very comfy, wide, sturdy, and it has fully adjustable height and head angles. That being said, it is not very small when folded, and it is not something that you would want to schlep around very much, but it is a very nice table for the price. I have no regrets about buying this table."
1,Not a Videohound review,"Whoever thinks this book offers adequate review must have as little understanding of the movies watched as these reviewers, or like these reviewers, does not actually watch movies. I can forgive a reviewer not having the same opinion as myself but at least it should be an educated opinion. Time after time the facts of the movies are incorrect, indicating they were not watched or only scanned. Also, the lack of a depth of understanding of cinema history, the lack of knowledge of a director's art and repertoire, etc. is unforgiveable. A good example is Bertolucci's The Spider's Strategem where the facts of the movie are given incorrectly. This guide is a good reference to the existence of a video, for lists of the actors and their movies, lists of directors and their movies, etc., but its reviews are sketchy, ill informed, and unsophisticated."
4,good,"been installing these for years , they work very well and are easy for the home owner to operate ......great"
1,"Wrong year, right book",These types of books should be removed from the inventory so they are not ordered in error assuming that it would be a current year publication.
4,"Earthy, rhythmic music at near its best","A very strong album that reveals a bit more each time it is played. A series of unexpected, but highly pleasant, turns and transitions. One of those few albums that is best heard from beginning to end. Perfect for a late afternoon-early evening get-together with friends. Highly recommended."
5,"Wonderful, loving book to reinforce mom's love","I read this book to my children (ages 2 and 4) every night. It makes them feel safe and loved, which is exactly why I bought it. My husband is currently deployed in the military, and I have been assembling a library of books that reinforce the messages that Mom loves you, and there are many ways she shows it. I think this book is fantastic, and it has made bedtime wonderful!"
5,"DirecTV, Finally quality television!","I bought DirecTV in August of 2000 and I have been the happiest subscriber since. DirecTV's picture quality is the best you can get. Compared to cable, DirecTV can give you 200+ channels of 100% digital service, whereas cable gets you 30 channels of analog service. And now that I can recieve my local channels from DirecTV, I can't see why anybody wouldn't want it. If you are sick of looking through the newspaper to find whats on, and to suffer from bad picture quality, then One-Click this system now, because the sooner you buy it, the sooner you can start enjoying the great service provided by DirecTV."
4,L. Turner,"I have purchased 3 different DirecTV systems over the years. ALL have been RCA. Why? Price and performance. All boxes still work. Over the years , I have upgraded from a basic system to a deluxe with the oval dish. I plan on getting a HDTV receiver or the Directivo this fall.I have the model with the Caller ID display. Now when I'm watching TV, I don't have to get up to see who's calling. When I don't want to talk, I lett VM pick up. If it's for my spouse, she has to pick up the phone. No more message taking or screening other peoples calls. The oval dish allows for subscription to Para Todos programming, HDTV (2 channels now and more to come)and some locals!!!I haven't had cable in over three years, and I don't miss it either!!!!"
1,Way over priced,"At first, I wasn't able to find these anywhere, so I ended paying $$$ for these. I then went to the Dollar Store randomly and found the exact same bag for $1.00. I was very disappointed!"
1,Don't close your wallet yet!!,"This year's surprise ... is that to import your financial data from QB, QB Pro 2000 is not good enough anymore. You need to have at least 2001 (of course, 2003 is most readily available). The good news is that even though you'll be out another $..., there are all sorts of wonderful new features to contend -er, take advantage of."
1,"Goodbye forever, Turbotax","Besides the well-documented c-dilla idiocy, I have had major technical problems with Turbotax for TY 2002. Saving to PDF format doesn't work (even with help from Intuit tech support). One of my state forms will only print from ""forms method"" and Intuit cannot explain why. The standard answer is ""uninstall and reinstall"", which doesn't work.Get Taxcut. For 2003, I certainly will."
1,Hope you like rebates!,If you like filling out mail-in rebates then this product is for you. There are 3 this year! That combined with thier new Licensing scheme make this product just not worth it.
1,Very Poor Service/Very Poor Product Key Activation Scam,"Intuit cannot seem to provide a remedy for validation of their product keys. Even following their own website's recommended process for updating the product (which includes copying the tax data file to a temporary directory, uninstalling the product, re-installing the product), the activation issue renders TurboTax more trouble than its worth. You'll spend a good couple hours (at least) with an uninformed (at best) customer service representative on this issue. No more TurboTax."
1,The WORST software I have ever installed.....,"I have never written a review this bad. I ""trusted"" intuit and I have used Turbo Tax for the PAST 3 YEARS. Now I am going to have to re-install Windows 98-SE and luckily I have a back up on my iomega zip 250 discs. I'm the type of person that is VERY careful with my financial data. I have backups of my Quicken data and my Turbo Tax data.Now I wish Intuit was more careful with the program data.I don't know where to VENT my frustration ! Maybe I will start with technical support....oh oh there is no phone number for technical support. Now I think the only thing I can do is warn ""others"" NOT to make the same mistake I have.Don't Buy This Product !"
1,Product does NOT work for me,some kind of internet registration new for this year is causing me to not be able to use the software I just bought.
2,Tired of Intuit's corporate arrogance!,Have used TurboTax many years. Use primarily my small laptop to do my taxes while on the road and transfer tax files to my desktop computer to work on larger screen & keyboard when I get home.You can only get full functionality on ONE computer. On my desktop it won't allow me to view whole forms or print or efile. Calls to their tech support people have been met with complete arrogance and indifference.Honest users are being unfairly harassed in their attempts to thwart a few dishonest ones.Even Microsoft allows users to activate Office XP on TWO computers realizing that many people use laptops on the road and switch to their desktops when they get home.I have now also purchased TaxCut and will use it until Intuit starts showing a little more customer appreciation.
1,Beware,"Turbo Tax has added a terrible copy protection scheme.- If you need to reinstall or move to a new computer, you will likely need to call TurboTax to reactivate. Do you want to take a chance of that happening the day you want to file your taxes?- The C-dilla is an intrusive and potentailly toublesome peice of code. It is very difficult to remove, takes a meg of memory, and imposes itself in the drive chain to your harddrive. There are many reports of decreased disk performance and anadotal stories of other problems. Do you want to take a chance?GO WITH AN ALTERNATE PACKAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Find Some Other Tax Software,"I've used TurboTax for years. This year I was unpleasantly surprised by their Activation process, which ended up with my having to call TurboTax tech support in order to get it working. Worse was in store. I upgraded to a new hard drive after the activation, only to find that TurboTax would no longer start up at all. Nor could I re-activate it. And, of course, this problem reared its ugly head on Sunday when tech support isn't available.Doing research using Google lead to the fact that a ... program (Safecast), was installed on my PC by TurboTax, one that is capable of collecting and pushing information over the internet. Intuit, naturally, says they only use Safecast to protect their copyright. That certainly made me feel much better.Needless to say, I will not be using TurboTax next year. While I appreciate their right to protect their software from piracy, I prefer to exercise my right to purchase from a company that does not put [C-Dilla] on my computer."
3,not so bad compilation but slightly boring,"It's a good compilation but rather boring - can't listen to it more than once, to my opinion"
5,Excellent Value/Product,"Perfect for the small camcorder. Just wish they'd include the adapter screw for the mike holder. That would be most helpful; instead, and later, I always have to order the screw adapter"
2,Truly disappointing,"I purchased this recording with great enthusiasm. The price was unbelievable, I mean for three CDs the price seemed too good to be true! And I suppose, it is too good to be true. The CD opens with one of the great arias of all time, but instead of hearing the aria, i was distracted by all sorts of coughing sounds, etc. In my opinion, this CD is unlistenable."
4,Great voices of our time.,"The recordings are live....yes I mean live with all the noises that go with a ""real"" live performance, you get the wonder of hearing these voices ""live"". They are not digitally remastered, you feel like you are there and you may get just as annoyed as you would with the gentleman in the 5th row that has a cough but it's real music with all the flaws. If you love or want to love the greatest voices of our time and you want the joy of hearing them live then you'll love this set. If, on the other hand, you want them digitally remastered to be just that - perfection at the hands of a computer - you may want to look further. I love these CD's & I enjoy them for the perfection they really are and not perfection at the hands of some computer operator."
4,Fidelity isn't everything,"Yes, it is true that this collection appears to be mostly amateur and in house theatrical recordings of Price, Sutherland, Callas, and Caballe. But for someone interested in great singing, it is a wonderful opportunity to hear these fabulous singers at the height of their powers against the backdrop and the frisson of the live performance. You'll hear them doing things here that you wouldn't in the tamer setting of the recording studio. It's mostly Italian repertory, with the exception of a little Mozart, Handel, and Wagner. The inclusion of Price is puzzling, since the set doesn't cast her in favorable light when compared to the other three great divas represented here. Marilyn Horne would have been a better third choice of someone from roughly the same generation. Give me singing like this, rather than the boring, lifeless (but superior fidelity) version that passes for ""high art"" today."
4,Better than Microsoft,I like this much better than the microsoft mouse I had for my Notebook. I have had no problems with it and really like it. It doesn't stick or lock up. Highly recommend it
2,Cute mouse but stopped working 2 years later,"The Logitech V200 is a decent mouse. The receiver attaches to the back of the mouse (which is average -- most new mice have the USB receiver slide into a compartment within the mouse itself). The battery life is good and the cherry red color is quite unique. However, the mouse itself has stopped working after 2 years later (bought in late December of 2006).Logitech has personally stopped manufacturing this mouse. I called Logitech, got a customer service rep right away, and after some testing with the rep, she just got my information to send a new mouse (the next model closest to the V200 is the V220). It was a really easy process and surprised as well since I heard reports that Logitech's customer service was quite horrible. But with the economy these days, everyone is boosting their service to retain customers.Decent mouse but failed to work suddenly after 2 years. Logitech service was outstanding.Get the V220 or higher."
1,Logitech V200 Cordless Mouse - Blue ( 931409-0403 ),i would not recommend it. The mouse does work any better than any othermouse. It does not zoom. It is hard to control. You can not turn it on and off.
3,Too small for most men's hands,"I got the mouse today and after using it for only a short while, it's starting to really hurt my hand. The mouse is so narrow, that it is causing cramps in my hand, something I never experienced before.I think this mouse would be great for a woman, but it you're a man with normal to large sized hands, beware."
4,Logitech V200 Cordless Mouse,Works great but if you don't hook the USB receiver back on the mouse every time your thought the batteries won't last as long as claimed. All in all I think it's the best cordless mouse I've had.
4,Quirky little mouse,"I was going to rate it a 3 star, but after a few days of getting used to I raised it to a 4 star. For the price you can't beat it. I got it at Radio shack at a door buster for $10 (I bought 3). At first it was slow to react to movements but after adjusting with the software, it reacted a bit better. But after adjustment the mousepad slowed. So when I want to use the mousepad I had to reajust. It was better then a microsoft mouse I bought previously. That mouse lost the signal and I could never reestablish it. It was also better then a cheap USB mouse I bought. Still sometimes when using this mouse it doesnt react at the first movemeent."
3,excellent when it worked,"it's a great mouse when it was working, except it died after a month!!this is the first mouse ever died on me (at the worst time)...arggg!!"
4,"Slightly heavy, but a good one","A nice wireless mouse... Easy to use, no installation required.... Just plug in the USB adaptor and you're ready to go!I would have been happier if the USB adaptor were fully insertable inside the mouse than it hanging from the outside."
2,Great till it breaks!,"I loved this mouse - easy to use, easy on battery power, attractively simple design with lots of good color choices - definitely a 5 star product. I loved it so much, when my first one broke, I immediately bought another. Now that one's broken too. Both broke in under a year. Both broke during transport. So, they're fantastic if you will just leave it on your desk, but choose something else if you will need to cart it around with your laptop, because they're too fragile for travel in my exeperience."
5,Red Rocket,"If you want a great little precise mouse, this is the way to go. If you need something that is small enough to carry along with you,big enough to be comfortable & like a little eye-candy, why not have a little pizazz(sp?).It's a good conversation starter, too.Too bad they don't come with an array of colors to choose from."
3,"Mouse is good, but the software is iffy.","I've been using this mouse for a few weeks now, and it's worked pretty good most of the time. However, most people want a mouse that works well all the time. I frequently attach and unattach the USB stick, as I'm using a laptop. This has once caused the drivers to become corrupted and also once caused the computer to freeze on startup. I actually found that for my applications, the mouse provides more functionality WITHOUT the Logitech software that comes with the package. I could not get the ""side scroll"" feature to work either with or without the Logitech software.But aside from these complaints, the mouse is pretty good, fairly accurate and pretty comfortable in the hand. It's still much more appealing than using a touchpad or stick that comes with the laptop."
2,Too small for my comfort,"I was convinced by all the positive reviews and I was in too much harry to read them more carefully. These 5 stars business is very misleading. If you want more accurate picture of how the customers feel about this or other products, check it at [...]. Much more meaningful that 5 stars. This mouse is of a very disappointing quality and goes through the batteries very quickly. I did not buy it at Amazon because I needed one in a harry since my previous Logitech mouse died after only 7 months, otherwise I would returned it. Office Depot is too much hassle to deal with. The quality of Logitech products is coming down fast and I will not recommend this one."
3,Average,"I have had this product for over a year. From the very beginning, the mouse did not work well. It has always been spotty and unreliable, so much that it can be annoying.I would not purchase this item."
1,Carpal Tunnel Surgery HERE I COME!!!!,"After one week of using this mouse my wrist began to hurt. Upon investigating what might be the cause I realized that there is no setting to set what position you hold the mouse. If you hold the mouse at a 45 degree angle and move left to right then the cursor moves diagonally instead of left to right. Most basic mice drivers have the ability to adjust this. Second... the mouse is spastic! I have adjusted and adjusted and there is just no decent speed on the mouse. So basically you have two speeds... spastic or slow. Which may also be contributing to my newly self-diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome.I did search on Logitech for a different driver for the mouse and was unable to find one, which then lead me here to shop for a new mouse."
5,It works like a dream!,"Got this as a tech-recommended replacement of the V320 that stopped working twice. Now, I am very happy. Great customer service!"
3,Had to return,"I purchased this mouse when it was a gold box item. I thought I couldn't go wrong with the reasonable price and additional [...]e. I installed it on my desktop per directions, it worked rather erratically for less than 24 hours, and then froze my computer. I'll admit that my system is somewhat older, but I didn't expect that result. Not being a computer wizard, I didn't fight it and just returned it. Love Amazon's easy return policies! Other than that, I'll agree with the others that it was a comfortable, yet compact, mouse, and I thought it pretty sharp-looking.Just sharing my disappointing experience, for what it's worth."
5,"Good mouse, but read if your computer cabinet is metallic!","This mouse is comfortable for average sized hands, but initially I had been seeing hesitant or sluggish mouse response - both in Windows and Linux. At first I thought it was a battery problem, but after reading the glowing reviews of this mouse, I though I would try moving the USB receiver from the rear of my computer to the front, and it improved dramatically! I have a computer in a metal box, so I guess line-of-""sight"" for 2.4GHz (as far as metal shields are concerned) may be important. The mouse battery has now lasted about a year, and is still working well.Great mouse."
5,Excellent wireless mouse!,"I purchased this mouse to replace my Microsoft wireless laptop mouse which was loosing connectivity and range after using it for only one year, even with a new battery.This mouse beats the Microsoft mouse I had hands down. I tested the range across the room and found it effective, even behind cubicle walls. I like the tactile feel and the precision of this mouse better than any I've tried. This is a great wireless mouse at a great price."
5,Great product for your laptop PC,"No wire, easy to keep in your laptop case, it uses 2x AA including in the box, the multi mouse scroll is a great tool... Works perfect in my Dell Inspiron 6400...----------------------------Sin cables, facil de guardar en tu bolso, usa 2x AA incluidas en la caja, el multi mouse scroll es muy útil... Trabaja perfecto en mi Dell Inspiron 6400...Thx Amazon !!!"
4,Great Notebook Wireless Mouse Available Up-to-Date!,"Purchased the V200 (blue) in Dec '05. This is the best laptop wireless mouse I've had so far. It weighs just right, good accuracy, cool darkblue color with chrome finish, and it works anywhere in my room. Have to take 1-star off because it won't work in glossy surfaces such as glass tables. Also, buttons spring feel soft. Good for browsing but just ok for gamming. Battery do not last for 9 months as it was first advertised but it last longer than older generation battery-powered optical mouse! I guess that's why amazon took it off their web descriptions."
2,It works ... for what it is...,"It is definitely one of the cheaper wireless mice. The receiver is a little weak, so it cuts out during use sometimes... if you are looking for a daily use mouse, then don't get this one, Get the Nano VX by Logitech, much better!"
3,Decent mouse with a huge flaw,"I'm on a quest to find the perfect wireless notebook mouse. As of yet, I have not found one that is a good every-day mouse and yet portable. The biggest flaw to this mouse is it's receiver. The snap on feature works fine, but ads bulk to the bottom of the mouse. The biggest problem is that it breaks easily. I've broken 2 of the receivers, now, both times they were attached to the computer and broke when lightly bumped. Not dropped or slammed against a doorway, but when moving it on my desk and it catches on something and bends or cracks where the USB port meets the receiver.Pros:Easy to installAll features workMouse itself is durableLong battery lifeGood mouse rangeCons:Weak receiver constructionFeel in hand (subjective, I know)Receiver not integrated well into base"
3,Buttons press too easily,"I recently purchased a V200 cordless mouse. It works OK other than the buttons push too easily. Exhaling too forcefully will cause a mouse click. Well, that is stretching it a bit, but, the buttons do click down much too easily. One has to rest ones hand off the mouse completely when not actually wanting to move or click. I suspect this easy clicking pressure is by design and not just a lemon mouse that I happend to get.For example, while browsing or surfing and you pause to read a web page, your fingers hover over the mouse. As you read, your hovering fingers slowly come to rest on the top of the mouse and surprise you with a right and left button click.As far as I know, there are no adjustments for the amount of force it takes to click a mouse button. Is there a cordless mouse anywhere that does provide an adjustment for button force?"
5,Excellent,"Had this for over a month, it's responsive, comfortable to use, and no battery draining issues."
5,Works Fantastic!!! Very Comfortable,"This mouse not only works great , it's a great deal! I had a Logitech mouse for 5 years and it finally gave out. I bought a Microsoft 6000 mouse from Costco to replace it. What a mistake, a piece of junk. Thank God I could return it. Logitech V-200 is the only way!!"
2,Loved it...until it stopped working,"I bought this mouse last July from Amazon...only a year ago. Just last week, the mouse completely stopped working. Of course, I changed the batteries, tried it on my other laptop, etc.I've never had a mouse ""die"" in this short of a period of time before, so I'm very disappointed. It does have a 3 year warranty which I intend on taking advantage of, but I still have to go through the expense and hassle of shipping the item to Logitech.While it worked, I loved it. The battery life was excellent, and I liked the shape and responsiveness of it. Unfortunately, it seems like the quality was sorely lacking."
1,regret,i must say i was really looking forward to receiving this game to play with many coupled friends but when i started going through the cards they were not at all fun too personal and serious
3,This. Has some intense questions,"I expected something a little more flirtatious and fun, but a lot of the cards had some serious questions on them which I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't consider bringing up at a small party."
2,It's not a toy.,This is a box of card with questions intended for adult couples to share experiences. I found it is poor offering the benifits claimed.
4,Good regardless of hookup/setup problems,"I believe it's a good buy and performs well, but the owner's manual could be more informative & give better explanations to assist the layman in the hookup & setup phase.I am still trying to test and get the proper sound settings for my speakers (Polk RM6600 & PSW250 sub). Still confused about a couple of settings and can't find the answers in the manual.The receiver definitely gets warm and needs good ventilation. This makes me wonder if I can leave it in my glass-front stereo cabinet.The on-screen setup menu is great and allows for easier programming. But, if the owner's manual was better written and provided more information, I would probably have given this a 5 Star rating...If anyone knows of a site where I can find hookup drawings and better information on the various functions of this receiver, please let me know. The JVC website has limited information."
4,SOUNDS GOOD TO ME,I have owned one of these now for about a year now. I think it produces excellent sound. I have it hooked up to six Klipsch speakers and it has unbeatable sound!
4,Good Product,"I ordered this as a replacement for a worn out remote wheel. Installed easily, a little off with the steering stops for my JR Radio XS3, but not a problem overall. Like the rubber wheel rather than the foam."
2,High expectations but incomplete delivery,"When I first purchased this book is looked like just the ticket to learn Crystal Report Writing. The table of contents promised a full and rich coverage of the topic. The author provides a light hearted approach and takes the dryness out of the subject. However, the big difficulty is the author does not include the database with the book. He claims that the student SHOULD have access to CRAZE.MDB. Not everyone has access to this data. All the examples and exercises are dependent upon this database. It is a real struggle to work through the concepts using a totally different database. The author does not even provide a listing of the data so the student could create the database before wading through the topics. Be aware of this drawback before you venture through this book."
2,"for Dummies, yes; for technical professionals, no","This book would be an excellent guide for helping a non-computer professional produce rather basic and simple reports. However, the examples provided remain at the simple level and are useless in helping produce more complex reports. A section on more complex formulas would have been appreciated. Whatever true power there is in Crystal Reports remains unexplored by this book."
3,"Good for beginners, not for programmers","I would have liked to see a brief of Crystal files. A short chapter on VB or Delphi components would have been a nice addition. More on how to work/make the important aspect of boilerplates or templates. EXAMPLES, EXAMPLES, EXAMPLES is the key. Crystal is a quasi-DP tool. So a CD or chapter with a few templates would certainly appeal to many. If you work with databases, go for it. If you are a developer, wait for version 2. When one tackles a serious tool like Crystal, one will not encounter many dummies. All in all a job well done and very easy to follow."
4,this is very good book for learners&report developers,It has many features.There is no need of any training required.Keep this book in front of ur computer and try to do the reports.He has given good examples.Particularly formulays are very important in crystal Reports.First doing the small Reports & afterwards try todo the complex Reports.
1,It went in the garbage,"This was a huge waste of time and money.I exercise regulary and am in o.k. shape. If you can say the same, don't waste your money.If you are a bit hefty and don't get any exercise this may be for you... but, any type of exersize is good in that case, it is more a matter of if you can enjoy it. I would recommend a jog or bicycle ride instead."
3,The Firm Pink yoga mat,"It was all right, albeit too thin. It kept folding over while I exercised. I may need something thicker next time."
1,Did not load!,"I have 2 laptops, XP and Vista and this program would not load on either one. The folders would open but it would not run setup, my laptops kept making that idling noise. I made arrangements to return. I was looking forward to using it."
4,It is easy to use and it has helped me a lot.,I love this product. It has been so very helpful and I would recommend it to friends.
2,It's so not what it could be :-(,"I had high hopes for this unit and quicky discoverd it ain't what I'm loking for. For starters, the company openly states their goal as being to use their consumer electronics products as simple proof-of-concept products to highlight what the hardware and softare can do. They're not their to provide end-solutions - they're an OEM manufacturerer. That justifies the beta software, which I installed and ended up frying my machine, so it's going back tomorrow. Also keep in mind that it's a shell with bare-bones functionality, and you're expected to downlaod and run a thrird party app to actually mke it run, There are 2 or 3 available, but that's a lot less palatable than having the functiomality built it.Good Luck!'"
1,Not what I expected,"Purchased the HD1000 for audio streaming and photograph display. The high definition digital display of photographs is great. Easy to set up and use. The audio capability is much more limited and not at all easy to use. I believe Roku is somewhat misleading in their claims about the audio capability of this unit. Many popular formats are not supported although Roku suggests using third part software. This is very limited and I am not a fan of having to use third part software to upgrade a product to meet its marketing claims. If audio is important to you, look elsewhere. I am disappointed with the device."
1,Do Not Buy This if planning Wireless,The Roku HD player was nothing but problems. I'm not a pro at things like this but my friend is and we spent over 3 hrs trying to get this thing to work and only then got it to work halfway. Judging from other people on Roku's message boards I wasn't the only one. It has serious networking issues. I sent mine back I was so disappointed. The idea was great but not the product.
4,great value,"The light is bright and has great color accuracy. Installation is a bit tricky if you hard-wire them since not all of the knock-outs are usable; the inside of this tiny fixture is quite full already. They are ugly, but I hid them inside of hardwood boxes tacked to the underside of my kitchen cabinets. They are very energy efficient, but you can't dim them. The price is great on Amazon."
3,Too slow and abstract,"Manfred von Bek, a supporter of the French Revolution flees Paris when he becomes endangered by the Terror. He reaches the city of Mirenburg and joins up with the con man St Odhran in a scheme to raise money to build a large balloon for a voyage to uncharted lands. However, von Bek and several others find themselves actually transported into the alternate dimensions of the Mittelmarch, where von Bek is drawn into plots because of his family affinity to the Holy Grail.I was not really able to get too interested in this book. The first half is quite slowly paced and in mainly concerned with von Bek's introspection on a number of topics. More happens as he journeys into the Mittelmarch, but the story becomes increasingly abstract as it progresses, and I did not care much about what happened."
3,creative dioramas,"i was shocked to see how little this book would help building a gas station,given the rave reviews ive read ,would have been livid had i paid more than 15.00 bucks."
2,"OK book, but the price is OUTRAGEOUS?!?!?!!!","The book is very useful giving ideas and techniques for auto diaromas. (It may be the only book on the subject) But I must be missing something with regard to the price. I bought the book from Kalmbach Books for $18.95 Unless the book has 22ct gold leaf pages, I'm at a complete loss regard the exorbidant price."
1,Length? Diameter??,Who cares how much it weighs. What about the diameter of the hose and the length???? I can't seem to find that anywhere.
4,Multiple uses,"This dictionary is created for Spanish speakers who are learning English. Its approach is unique; the same English word is defined completely in both English and Spanish in every case. Obviously, Spanish speakers can use this book to help them understand the meanings of English words by reading the definitions in their native language. However, they can also use the English definitions to help them learn other related words, and how English works. Finally, as a Spanish student, I used this dictionary to help me figure out words in Spanish I could use to express certain subtleties of meaning that I associated with English words I could think of. Unfortunately, I think I got this dictionary a little late in my Spanish learning for it to be incredibly helpful to me, since the number of words is rather limited. I'd recommend this for beginning level learners of either English or Spanish."
3,"Nice fabric and color, but difficult to use","I really like the style, fabric, and the color of the shawl, but it's not easy to use... and not enough covering, so I have to keep adjusting it while busy feeding the baby. I'm just using it when feeding my baby in the car."
2,Not a big fan,"I only used it twice. I didn't get the hang of the shawl, I couldn't see my baby when I was feeding him. my baby ends up pulling it out of place.it makes a great car seat cover but that's about it for me."
2,Covers well but too thin,"I bought this because I thought the ones with the wire opening would allow others to see down. I used this and my baby hated it, made her really hot an would fall in her face. It took 3 hands to get her latched- 1 to hold my breast, 1 to navigate the baby, and 1 to open the cover. A friend gave me her cover with the wire opening and I love it! So much easier to use."
3,Great fabric but didn't work as well as I had hoped,"I do love the fabric, it is super soft and nice, I also like that it covers the front and back of you. The sides however don't provide much coverage and if your baby is like mine, and grabs and pulls stuff it's a constant struggle to keep this in place. I haven't used it as a blanket or stroller cover yet. I think this would work best for newborns but once they get to the point where they are grabbing everything it is really easy for them to grab the sides and expose you."
1,Soft fabric is this shawl's downfall,"Despite the lovely soft fabric using this shawl has been an exercise in frustration. The soft fabric and neck seam means you cannot see your baby. Particularly when first learning you need a hand for baby, one for breast and then extra hands to hold out the neck so you can see what you're doing and yet another to keep the fabric in place so that you're not exposed or so the fabric doesn't get all entangled between breast and baby. There is not enough coverage on the sides so that you're mid-riff is exposed and it is too short. Every time my baby waved an arm she would pull the fabric up and either get herself tangled or expose me. I hated using this thing! Purchased a replacement with stiff neckline and long, wide material that tents over my baby so that she doesn't get entangled, bothered or distracted by the fabric."
2,Difficult to use.,"I bought this based on reviews, but would not recommend it. I tried to use it but it kept slipping from side to side and the baby didn't like having it lay on his face. I've heard that the Hooter Hider is a better option since it has a wire in the top so you can see the baby."
3,"It works, but isn't my favorite option for nursing.","Yes, this shawl keeps you covered and is made from very nice material. But it isn't easy to look at your baby as there is no boning or other stiffening at the neck opening. I ordered another nursing product at the same time as I ordered this one and I like the other product better. I now use this shawl as my emergency back-up."
2,Not enough coverage,"The concept behind this shawl is wonderful. Unfortunately, I found that it didn't live up to it's premise of modest nursing coverage. It did not stay in place well, and needed to be constantly tugged back in to position to keep my cleavage covered. Once I managed that, my sides and back would be exposed. I was uncomfortable using it even at home around our older children - I certainly wouldn't take it out in public. I finally found what I needed with a well constructed nursing tank.Nursing Tank By Undercover Mama (Medium, Dark Brown)"
3,There are better covers out there...,"I received this cover as a gift when my son was born. It is a very soft and came in handy more than once when I had forgotten a blanket, and I thought it was beautiful. However, I struggled with getting it into a position so that I could see my baby, cover myself, and still have both hands available. It was better than just a blanket or a towel, but it was not easy to use and I HATED breast-feeding in public. Then my daughter came along, and not only was it a struggle to use, but she completely refused to latch on underneath it. She hates to have her face covered, and if she cannot look up and see my face, she just won't nurse. I had no idea what to do, but I was given a beautiful cover from another brand as a gift and suddenly my problem was solved, and now I can nurse in public without any problems (and with both hands free). I would keep looking - there are better covers out there."
3,soft and attractive,I like it. Only thing I wish was that it covered my sides. It leaves me feeling exposed on the sides. it is really soft and pretty.
2,I returned it,"I tried it out once and didn't like it. I was not able to see my baby to help her latch on despite the large neck opening. And the opening was too large to the point that in some positions I would've felt too exposed if around anyone else. I decided the ribbed neck covers are much better for me. However, if you've somehow mastered the nursing covers without the ribbed neck, then this might be okay. The material is unbelievably soft and it's very attractive."
1,Ended up getting another one,"Couldn't write the review until the baby was here :) And now that I am breastfeeding, this shawl is pretty annoying. I agree with one of the reviewers here. The hole is too big so I struggled with trying to cover myself. at the same time, I can't see my baby. The best I can do is what you see in the picture, but I you can't see my baby's eyes. and at that exact position, I'm not even sure I'm decent in front of everyone. so I ended up buying another. I got the bebe-au-lait one and am going to give that a try.i liked this one b/c of it's multi function use. but if the main function I need it for is not working, what's the point? maybe it'll fit better when the baby is older. my baby is 6 weeks (exactly how long it look me to breastfeed). I liked how discreet this looks too..poncho vs an apron look but by the time you tell everyone you're breastfeeding, they will be expecting your apron look anyway--made popular by The Office, I think :)Hope this helps."
3,Not the best nursing cover,"I bought this after seeing it on someone and thought it looked adorable. After ordering it and using it myself I was a little disappointed. The material is really soft and comfortable, but the shawl doesn't really do it's job of covering boobs and baby when nursing. The neck is too big and droops down revealing a nursing baby and the sides seem to turn a lot. I like that it covers a lot of the sides, but overall it's not very practical. Other nursing covers seem to work better and unfortunately this one is now just laying in my drawer. I hope to find a use for it this winter."
2,Not a good nursing shawl,"Though I like the appearance and soft feel of this shawl, the coverage is not good. The neck opening is too big and so hangs down too close to the breast. As other reviews said, the sides are also too short to provide good coverage. After trying this shawl, I bought one of the Bebe Au Lait ones with the stiff neck opening for better viewing of the baby. I like it so much better - it's much easier to use. So I would recommend you skip this one and go straight to Bebe Au Lait."
5,L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Clay,"The design is very morden and the material is very soft and comical. With it I can feed Baby anywhere in the Public, it is very comfortable."
3,A very BASIC recorder...,"I picked this up hoping for more than it offers. Here are some....pros:Low cost for a digital recorderCard based memory systemEasy to useUSB interfacecons:Horrible sounding amp simulatorHorrible effectsNo tone controlNo solo/mute buttonsI may a bit hard on the product in regards to some of the cons as the majority of my experience is actually with a 24 track Analog system and various midi recording devices (hardware and software). It's great as a sketchpad but for anything more, it falls a bit short."
3,works fine,"be careful when using words ""like new"" when a used product is being sold. Not many things I know that are ""like new"" have built up oily dust and scratches. Description said ""used a couple times"", REALLY! More like several times. In the end paid too much for it!"
1,Terrible Product,"This could be the worst buying choice I've ever made!I researched this product and others for over 5 months and finally bought it off of Amazon. When it finally arrived I was thrilled to get recording. After about two hours of recording time the card, a card error message appeared! I could no longer record anything on the card. Whenever i turned on the machine the card error message appeared and the machine froze. After doing extensive research on the fostex site i learned that the SOFTWARE HAS A FLAW IN IT!!! You actually have to update the software through the internet, which i couldn't do because the machine froze. I tried contacting customer service but they don't accept phone calls and were closed for vacation. TERRIBLE!I need to return this product ASAP. !!!!!WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"
2,This is no dragon book,"I was excited when I first scanned through a friends copy of this book because of its treatment of modern compiler design issues. I ran out, ordered the book, read through it more carefully and realized that it was nothing more than a collection of papers. There would be nothing wrong with this if it were so advertised. The book lacks original analysis. I wouldn't stedfastly say DON'T by this, but, I would say you might be better off just going to your local college CS library and grabbing all the relevant papers referened in the book."
2,Confusing at best,"I've seen chapter 14 of this book referenced (by a university professor giving suggestion to his students, not by a random guy) as:""Another conventional approach to strength reduction. 35 pages of the same kind of confusing crap we've all come to expect from this book.""This could not sum it up better. A confusing book at best, presenting basic material so as to make it look ""advanced"", and without any covering of even relatively new techniques. A good source of references to papers that you should read, but not at all a valid reference on its own."
3,*****CAUTION*****,"This album has the same UPC as several others. Be sure to inquire what item the Marketplace Seller is selling.The album listed is supposed to be:""Moviola: The Year You Were Born"" [Album Pictured Is Wrong As Well]The Track Listing Is CorrectUPC: 711447003720"
3,"Free Installation? Yes, but when?","The dish is well made, and if you have the right stereo equipment, the digital auto capability of this dish is well worth the extra money. Direct TV is great. I would give the equipment and Direct TV 5 stars. But I would give the ""free installation"" 0 stars. I guess it's o.k. if you don't care when the equipment is installed! (...) It isn't rocket science. The really irritating part is that the dish purchase doesn't include the required installation kit! (...)"
2,Why buy a Volkswagan at a Mercedes price?,"The RCA receivers and equipment are flimsy, 3rd rate, and basically pieces of junk. If you are looking for quality for your money, the flagship of the industry is the Hughes receiver which leads the field in their technology. They set a standard that RCA can not compete with."
3,"They were ""born"" in the CABBAGE PATCH, for pete's sake....","This was an interesting book, but I couldn't understand the complaints adopted people and birthmothers made about the ""adoption papers"" that come with the doll. The dolls, after all, were ""born in the CABBAGE PATCH!"" with Xavier Roberts and a partner of his listed as parents."
5,A credit to the gaelic language,I think this CD is wonderful.It took a lot of courage to do a completly gaelic CD without adding any english songs.It adds to it and makes it Gaelic to the core.Our whole family enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Beware of using AC adapter with this TV,My RCA LCD color tv worked perfect until I used an AC adapter there's no way I can tell now it was damaged because I set it to the correct dc current on the AC adapter that was listed on the tv itself. I plugged the AC adapter into the wall the screen went dark now the tv no longer works.
3,the good and the bad,i love this tv but some times if i am out side i can not wach it all that i like and i have a hard tim seeing it out sid but when i am in side i cna not wach all the thing that i like in all part of my house but i is a good tv
2,Interesting but obscure and lacks attribution,"Our book club which includes several college educated persons expected a helpful source for Native American spiritual beliefs. Instead, it found this book full of unfamiliar terms, distracting words, and sweeping generalities as it sought to explain varying ""sacred"" beliefs of various tribes and certain Native American archeological finds in Kansas. Also, we had questions about the credibility of many assertions, as though the author was speaking of his own authority and expertize. If that were the case, then the book should have described his credentials more completely than the quick summary on the back cover, which contained no specific academic references. It was not an easy read and many of its points regrettably tended toward obscurity."
5,Beautiful Story,"Yolen, as usual, wows and wonders the reader with the story of Dove Isabeau. A beautiful, soft, sweet and innocent dove of a girl discovers a dragon without and within her after suffering the enchantment of her wicked and jealous stepmother. Isabeau, unlike many of her fairy tale counterparts, isn't going to passively watch her knight in shining armor be turned to stone for all eternity, and she takes sword in hand to try and save the day. Yolen's prose is singsong storytelling at its best, that rolls along like a bard by the evening fire. The stepmother is underdeveloped, as she is in most stories, and the reader might wonder why she hates Dove Isabeau so much, but that certainly doesn't take away from the pure enjoyment of this story."
5,Great!!!,"First of all,,I love my Dyson! Second,,I love this attachment. It does help to clean, not just the matress, but other furniture items. With two dogs that believe they own the house, keeping everything clean is a top priority! And this piece does help me greatly."
2,Amazon purchase useless to me,Item came timely however it DOES NOT fit my Dyson as the opening doesn't fit the extension wand. A useless tool for my Dyson Animal vacuum
2,Item received doesn't match picture,The item I ordered does not match the item I received! The item I received is not the one that is shown on amazon. It is only a larger version of the attachment that came with the dc25! Do not order this product.
4,"Works well, but debatable on whether its worth the price","Snaps on to my DC-25 perfectly, I've used this tool to vacuum my couch predominantly. It's basically identical to the attachment that comes with the vacuum (think they call it the stair tool) but it's wider. I'm not super sold on the usefulness of this attachment, but definitely need something like this if you want to vaccum your couch or mattress (just not sure how great of a job it does for heavy dust)."
2,It Broke.,Kept coming off the hose then it broke from the handle. But it worked great while I was using it.
2,Disappointing for a Dyson Produce,"As an owner of 2 light colored cats and a red couch I was desperate for a ""magic"" tool that would work to really rid the couch of the cat hair. I have had great success with my Dyson on the floor but for those of you who have tried it up on the couch, it looses suction. This looked like the perfect attachement to work with my Dyson to finally be rid of the hair. Well, was I wrong. This was expensive and does not work any better than the standard attachments that came with my Dyson. There are two strips of lint catching material that work well to de-lint the fabric but if that was what I was looking for I would have been better off just buying a large lint brush. Also, if this is the mechanism to clean mattresses I would certainly not trust that it would remove all of the debris that I would want removed by a mattress tool. Overall, I am truly disappointed in this Dyson tool. In hindsight I should have skipped on the red couch and this product."
2,Overpriced!,"This product is OK - it's just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum. The head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint-catching fabric. The extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast, but for what it is, this attachment is ridiculously overpriced!"
4,great for all upholstery,"I bought this to help with cat hair around the house. I didn't realize at the time that the DC17 Animal I'd purchased was going to come with a smaller version of it, but I'm still glad I bought it. I use it to clean the sofa, pillows, the bed, and even use it across the counter to pick up little bits before I wipe down. It's got a nice pair of lint brush strips that grab pretty much all of the animal hair off anything in 1-2 passes."
4,She's cool and this is a lot of fun :-).,"Yes, I'll admit that I'm being careful with certain ""slides"" and other moves because I have carpet. However, I think this is at least worthy of four stars just for Kristin's energy and personality alone. (I like the fact that she speaks loudly and clearly with a genuine non-stop smile.) I'm really enjoying the video and I've only used two of the workouts so far. I use videos like this one primarily for good warm-ups for my kettlebell routines, not for my heavy cardio days. That said, the music and moves are fantastic and her cuing is spot on. She makes me want to go out and dance, which I haven't done in years :-); the fun factor is extremely high. She did a great job and I look forward to using this one again and again."
4,Not enough to get toned,"I was really flabby and wanted to get in shape, plus I love dancing.The video music is tolerable and the instruction is clear but in the end 60mins on a stairmaster and ellpicycle did what this video can't - keep up a solid cardio and give muscle tone."
5,Really fun!,"This work out is so fun!! Kristin Jacobs has a great personality and such an energetic teacher. For people like me who don't dance, some of these moves did take practice, but once you learn it, they are so fun! I really look forward to working out with this video time and time again."
3,"Great dances, poor music and instruction!","I can't learn dance moves without cool music and these moves were to a ""beat"" and, as a result, I never picked up the really cool moves on the DVD. Also, there was a lot of knee twisting and she gave very poor instruction to prevent injury. If you like ABDC then you will love this DVD."
1,Horrible!,"This was one of the worst workout videos I have ever done! The instructor is very cheesy and the moves are silly, awkward, and out of date. When I selected a hip-hop video I wanted to have a REAL hip-hop routine that happened to work me out, not a workout video with silly choreography that is pretending to be hip-hop moves! When will they ever get a real hip-hop dancer to do one of these workout videos rather than an exercise guru?? What a waste of 10 dollars!!"
2,What am I missing?,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but I didn't like this DVD much at all. I own several other 10 Minute Solutions and they are all hit or miss but this one is definitely a miss.I have been dancing since 4 years old: jazz, ballet, tap, ballroom, and yes, hip hop and I just could not enjoy this DVD.I found the choreography confusing and a little disjointed. The moves did not seem to run into each other very well and I found the footwork and arm movements not complimentary at all. Very often I could do one and not the other. I tried the whole disc twice, and just couldn't pull it off. I felt awkward all the way through.There were only 2 sections I halfway enjoyed, but 2 out of 5 isn't really that good.I must say the instructor is likeable but I just didn't enjoy her routines. I think I will stick to Jennifer Galardi's dance DVDs they are much better.To those who like it though, enjoy! It must be me, I must be missing something."
2,"ok, but I'm not a fan of the music","I was hoping for songs that I knew or at least songs with words to get me pumped up. It's just kind of lame, hip hop sounding music."
5,Fun and Funky,I enjoyed this DVD thoroughly.It was so much fun and the time goes so fast I would not hesitate to purchase any others in the series.It's great to work out in your own home and you don't have to worry about being embarrassed at the gym!
4,Great for old LP tanks.,"I don't have a compressor at home, and I live 10 miles from town. So when I need air in a tire, or help out a friend with a flat to get into town to get it fix, I have it. :) Finding a tank to convert for air is easy! I'm going to get one for the car and for my Daughters car. It needs a valve to isolate tank from the hose and air chuck. It will lose air over a weeks time. Just keep it filled."
4,Another Winner In This Series,"Having discovered this series in its most recent form, (the next one, which is THE QUEENE'S CHRISTMAS) I am working my way backwards through them. This one is another treat; in fact, I read it in one long evening. Yes, it is improbable that QE1 had the time to solve mysteries, but not for a minute do I believe she couldn't have, had she felt inclined to do so! The author makes the dialog and setting believable, too, something not often achieved with the historical mystery."
5,Unfaithful info,"To be precise this is the music from the FIRST Paris concert by the Mingus group on April 17/18 at Salle Wagram and Johnny Coles- UNMENTIONED!- plays trumpet on the first tune of record 2 (which was in fact the first tune of the concert: I was there) This is the time when he collapsed on the scene!I believe Mrs Mingus should have mentioned that in her liner notes in stead of the longish tale of her bootleg chase!The second concert is now released as ""The great Charlie Mingus Concert Paris 1964"" with correct liner notes mentioning that an earlier version had substituted the Salle Wagram version of ""Goodbye Pork Hat"" to the actual one (a quintet in lieu of a sextet in fact).Initial release was a mess too in other words.Zylberstein (Paris,France)"
4,Small stuff,"Bought this as a stocking stuffer on a whim and found it to be of better quality than I expected. The leather strap broke, as it had several cuts in it (may have been from my razor knife when opening the package) but a replacement length was a simple and inexpensive process from the craft store."
4,something that can grow with your system,"I am not an audiophile. I happened to come into this receiver at a very reasonable price. I have some tech background, but very little. This system is both very complicated and yet somewhat intuitive. As another reviewer said, the manual is a bunch of technical jargon that is dificult to follow. I have yet to get a surround sound system. so I am only listening to this on 2 speakers, but I can still appreciate the great sound. I have a VCR and DVD player hooked up to it, and they work great. Very noticeable difference from my previous receiver."
4,Gives more detail than other books,I've read many other green building books. What I liked about this one was that it really goes into the nuts and bolts more - it give more detail than other books including some of Dan Chiras's other books - which I guess makes sense since it is about a limited area/topic.
4,Definitive Introduction to Solar Design,Must read for basic understanding of passive solar and energy efficient house construction.
4,The Solar House Book,Ordered this book for a class. Unfortuntely the class did not work out for my needs. I offered the book to other classmates . It was required reading for the class.
5,Excellent passive solar book,An excellent passive solar publication that is very complementary to my own book: The Sun-Inspired House: house designs warmed and brightened by the sun. I knew that Dan Chiras had already published an excellent book with passive solar details so one of the goals of The Sun-Inspired House was to show numerous examples of passive solar homes while adding another way to look at passive solar.
5,educational and fun to read,"I'm taking a course in cuban studies this semester and my professor had come across this book and suggested it as supplemental reading. I bought it and as I started reading it, I found that I couldn't put it down. I ended up revising my term paper and using it as my major source. Ms. Sheppard has created not only an historical document, but an enjoyable piece of literature."

2,"Sturdy, but dog wasn't very interested","It is indeed very sturdy and withstands chewing for a long time, but after eating less than a third, my dog (a Doberman) wasn't interested. It's been just lying around ever since, sometimes he plays with it, sometimes licks it, but doesn't want to keep chewing on it. This is while other rawhide chew bones we've tried he ate completely without much delay."
2,For those who want to write bad books.,"It's certainly a GOOD book to teach you how to write BAD books. The author seems to be a successful one and her books are best sellers in ""popular fiction"" (whatever this means. Is popular = bad + repetitive ? ). She discovered the formula and intends to share it with her readers. The stories shown lack the truth that a good writer always express even when he or she makes everything up in a story. This book can be recommended for fun, but not to be taken seriously."
4,The Deadlist Denial,This book keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time. It held my interest all the way to the end.
3,City vs County,"Angie Cordel needs a break. Her spoiled, overachieving, and drug addicted ex-boyfriend is stalking her. She decides to apply for a Governess position in the Outback. But nothing prepares her for Taylor Maguire.Taylor has been hurt by a city woman before. Can he trust Angie with his son and his heart?Only time and the closeness that the Outback breeds can tell.Read Outback Heat and discover the Wonder of Down Under."
3,(Bad) backing vocalist!,"Crack the Sky is one of the best rock bands of all time. They should have been superstars. My dream is to see them live. This relatively recent recording has great musicianship, and they mostly seem to concentrate on their greatest songs. And unlike most live albums, where bands drudge their way through exact replica arrangements of their songs, Crack the Sky here improvise quite a lot, and have an excellent horn section guesting and spicing up procedures. That's all great, but somebody doing backing vocals on this is constantly and painfully out of tune. He makes the late Linda Mc sound like she had perfect pitch. Who's the guilty party? Someone who was there should know. You've got to drink a lot of beer before the guilty backing vocalist becomes bearable."
1,I hate it,"This boom pole/fish pole is USELESS unless (I assume) you buy the mic holder/shock mount of the same brand. Basically, it doesn't work with ANY other mic holder/shock mount. The part where the mic holder/shock mount goes is inverted! It's a hole instead of a screw. Your mic holder will not screw ONTO it! You must buy a mic holder that screws INTO it. USELESS with any other brand of mic holder/shock mount."
1,"Smells like a wet dog, and I got soaked!","This is the biggset waste of paper ever. The whole book is nothing but an over sized CD cover. Do not waste your money. Mine is lining the bottom of a brid cage! This book was tossed together to make a fast buck without any reguard to the game player. Just because we like to play video games,does not make us stupid. This book is insult, and a disgraceful ploy to remove some extra cash from game players pockets. There other guides I have found to be very helpful. This one should be recalled like an 1972 Ford Pinto, before it does some real damage. It does not show or even speak of the 6th Lic. Skull and cross bones is my rating. The photos are even ""grain"" and all they had to do was copy them off the disk. GT2 is a fun game, it has some gliches, but they are minor ones compaired to this book. Remember a back-up save card is a must. Good Luck - Keep the Rubber on the road, and the Shinny side up"
1,Terrible!,"I bought the game with the strategy guide, and the gamewas really cool,but the strategy guide was a worthless pieceof garbage.Dont buy the strategy guide,just read the instruction booklet if you want to get info on the game.Trust me, you willget more information of the instruction booklet."
1,This book is worthless,"It's nothing but a rewrite of the manuals that come with the game, it contains no useful information or strategies at all. An utter waste of money."
1,Don't bother,"nearly useless...good for finding a particular car..but NO info on settings,special cars,special races,where to use certain cars.etc. very weak"
1,Worthless POS,"This ""guide"" (if it deserves to be called that) is entirely worthless. ""Wow, it shows all the cars!""---Who cares? They are sorry pictures anyway and the ""information"" on each car doesn't explain diddly squat. ""But it tells you how to build the ULTIMATE WEAPON!""---Well, there is no Used or New Mazda RX-7 GT-X that costs 6,740 Credits. This piece of junk doesn't earn its title ""Strategy Guide"", at most it earns the name ONE BIG POS! Take this advice and don't buy the THING that has Prima's name on it. The people who invented GT2 shouldn't have to be disgraced to see this ignorant interpretation that Prima calls a ""Strategy Guide"". Besides, at 15 bucks a pop, it is clearly to high. I made an awful mistake buying this THING, so please, don't screw yourself over. If you are considering buying this THING, I BEG you DON'T!"
3,Long Lasting?,"I purchased this battery charger to use with my digital camera. After fully charging the batteries, they lasted about 5 minutes when I was taking pictures sporatically then the camera shut down. Not what I was expecting. Don't know if the batteries are of decent quality but I feel they should have held up a lot longer. I was not even using the flash."
1,Poor quality & service,"My RCA reciever did not last a year, the charge for replacement was $75--I decided to buy another brand."
1,Insufficient Warranty,"We bought this RCA receiver when we got satellite 16 months ago. Its features were adequate but not intuitive. After 4 months of minimal use as a second-room receiver the unit stopped receiving 2/3 of all channels. Tech support offered very little information, aside from the fact that the warranty expired after 3 months, and would cost [$$$] plus shipping to repair - we paid [$$$] as a new unit. I would look elsewhere for this price range. You are likely to find better support away from RCA."
5,Great little DirecTV receiver,"This RCA receiver has a small, cool running chassis with every feature you can dream of. Caller ID which works 95% of the time. Alpha guide searchs. WINK. Audio anyway you want it. DirecTV-Plus capability. The only two weaknesses that I've noticed are 1. I've never seen my message light come on and 2. the RF remote has virtually no RF power. As far as messages go DirecTV always sends messages to my other DirecTV receiver so no matter. The RF remote is RF impaired due to FCC restrictions, not RCA restrictions. I use the RCA IR pyramids for remote room use. They work well for me as long as the pyramid is keep away from my PC. One little known fact about WINK is that DirecTV is said to be using WINK help try to slow down the signal hackers. I fully expect this receiver to provide me years of trouble free service."
5,God's Awesome Power,Thank You Jesus for Gwen Shamblin's approach to weight loss. It lines up perfectly with the Bible.
1,Twisted scripture,It is very scary how the author subtly twists scripture to push her diet plan and capatolize on her business in Jesus' name. She has made millions and cheated people out of their money. Families have been torn apart due to her dangerous cult and one child even died. It looks good on the outside but it is not pretty when you dig deeper. I don't want others to have to go through what I and others have had to go through so take my word for it and stand clear of this woman and her products.
3,Designed for short people,The waste strap was way up on my ribs --- seems to be made in China for Chinese physiques. Also did not have much in the way of compartments. We brought this day pack and a Patagonia day pack on a recent trip to the Galapagos. The Patagonia was way superior.
4,Decent Beanie,Once again a gift - this one fits decently and thus gets decent wear but it cannot match up to the Kangol Beanies that I own or have gotten as gifts. It is also middle of the road in keeping one warm where as the kangol once again excels.
4,Fun adventuring,This book contains two of the Vlad books in one. This wouldn't be a good starting point for anyone new to the series. Look for The Book of Jhereg.This picks up with Vlad doing his usual mischief. It gives him more of an edge when his wife starts debating the ethics of the empire. I thought that part started to get old toward the end but it picked up.
5,The Jhereg Novels,"Steven Brust captures the interest of many adventurous readers with these novels. The characters are interesting, and their development is solid. Vlad and his Jhereg weave enticing and adventurous stories. These novels, are the kind of fantasy books that take you out of your every day existence and immerse you into Vlad's world... So if you're ready for some adventure and intrigue, these novels are a good place to begin your journey."
5,An excellant series,So far he has never written a novel in the series I did not like. The world is fascinating and has great depth.
4,Another good bood from Steven Brust.,"The second book in a trilogy of the collections of the stories of Vlad Taltos, this book is just as good as the first. Though it only contains 2 books instead of the 3 of the previous one, the writing has improved and it provides both good back story for Vlad Taltos and picks up where the last book left off. Again I find it annoying that the books couldn't be published in chronological order, but even so, it is still a very good book. The stories are as interesting as always and the characters are even better developed than they were before. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or mystery books."
5,Great stories of real adventure,"I've seen adventure racing on TV (Eco Challenge, Primal Quest, etc.). And those shows always concentrate on the drama, the beautiful people, and so on. This book, however, shows what adventure racing is all about. The 30 stories in this book are all from people who love the sport of adventure racing and have dedicated a part of their lives to the sport that they love.There are stories from seasoned veterans and beginners -- all of which demonstrate how we can overcome great odds to reach the finish line. The lessons learned from these athletes will help athletes and non athletes alike. Great book!"
5,Easy read.,"Fun and informative. I have already shared this with others I have, or will, race with and we have all enjoyed it."
3,mild,Makeup in love is the best.The others that I heard will pass.I will buy it to go along with my collection.
5,Get more for the buck,"I wanted a 25 + inch LCD TV on tight budget and this was the obvious choice. I am happy with the TV. The colors and sound is good. I connected it with my Windows XP MCE and it's awesome. The picture-in-picture will not play two channels from TV. It has to be two different inputs like, TV and video or computer etc."
2,"Good TV, when it's working. Horrible customer service","I got one in January. I've had to call Polaroid's customer service 5 or 6 times for it freezing, and ultimately not turning on. They told me a service person would call, and a month later I called them to find out what was going on, and they had no record of me calling. They finally shipped me the module it needed but didn't tell me anything else. I put it in myself, and the tv is now working, but they still haven't called me. I will never spend any money on a Polaroid prduct, and am glad I didn't pay for this one."
3,Wallet well made but has issues,"I've been carrying a tri-fold, synthetic wallet for 15 years and I've only found one that I would consider to be great. This one is good. It is well made (I don't care about the ""hemp"" non-sense, in fact that's a detractor to me) but the problems include:1) the plastic window for the license sticks to laminated stock. A better way to manage this would have been to use see-thru nylon mesh like my last wallet used. Never stuck, easy to see, no cracking or yellowing of the plastic and durable.2) the zipper pocket is where I keep my credit cards because on inherrent problem of these wallets is for cards to slip out of the pockets sewn in for that purpose. BUT THE OPENING OF THE ZIPPER IS TOO SMALL. Only needs to be about 3/16"" wider to make access to cards easier.Other than those two issues, I'm pleased with the wallet... Expect to get about 5-7 years out of this one when I can start the search all over again."
3,What a voice,Her voice is amazing and she does all her big songs. Not exactly riveting like a Cyndi Lauper concert but still pretty good nonetheless.
1,What is happening to music?,Whaaaaat!? the hell is this crap. This sorry excuse for talent and rap is pathetic. How can something like this get signed. It is the worse i ever heard and is the worse thing to happen to radio since the TV was invented.Lil john has very little talent and i would not pay the 10 cents to burn this crap. VERY BAD...Ooooookaaaaaaay! Yeaaaaaah!
1,Be cautious about purchasing a TV with VSR built in.,".TV's with VCR's built do not work well with cable box remotes. You may find you cannot turn the TV on with the cable remote--a common problem.This TV does not have stereo audio. That means it is a cheap TV set.I recommend you look at the Panasonic TV because they resist interference the best. Look for a TV with stereo audio , SVHS input, and skip the VCR--you are better off with this as a separate unit."
2,Sad and disturbing,"How sad! I wanted to learn about Marlene Dietrich's life and this is the first biography I've read, but it will not be the last. I felt sorry for the author (her daughter), but that changed. Being confused and unhappy as a child is one thing, to stab your mother in the back after she is dead is quite another, especially as it is so obvious that Dietrich trusted her daughter. Also, I noticed a mistake about Yul Brynner (he had a Swiss passport, but was born in Russia to a wealthy family).There were some interesting stories and information that only a family member would know, but I can't recommend the book, unless the reader realizes that an ugly reading experience awaits."
4,One of a kind,Marlene Dietrich was a creation and lived an extra-ordinary life but her daughter was forced to be the real actor in the family. I felt close to Maria as she revealed her life with her mother. The small things hinted more about the legend's real character than things that have been written in the past.
1,Self-Pity and Bitterness,"Undoubtedly, Ms Riva had greater access to the details of her subject's life than most biographers, inasmuch as Marlene Dietrich was her mother. What is distressing about this sad book is the picture it gives us, not of Ms Dietrich, but of her embittered, peeved, self-pitying and unforgiving daughter. Doubtless, Marlene Dietrich's flaws were as large as her outsize personality, but Ms Riva's insistence on seeing these failures as conscienceless personal attacks on her and her sanity is wearisome and, in truth, a banal and hackneyed cop-out for whatever feelings of inferiority she suffered through the early years of her life.This is the biography of beautiful, selfish woman by her plainer, self-obsessed daughter. It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth and a feeling of true sorrow that Ms Riva could not resolve her scarcely ambiguous dislike for her mother outside the pages of a book."
5,the incomparable Marlene,"Who ever could write an objective biog. of their mother? Not many people. Considering the author's life I think that she does a pretty good job. It has none of the constant sniping of 'Mommie Dearest', and it records a turbulent life with many ups and downs.I found the end very sad, comparing one's own image of the ancient and dying Dietrich with the glamorous, seductive star in the photos throughout the book.It is not just an inventory of a life, it is a book on a relationship, and a lifestyle. It is not trashy, as many such books are, nor is it glowing with nostalgia. Can one not imagine how sad it must have been for the author to witness her mother's decline?I was enthralled by this book."
4,"Book was in good condtion. Well packed,",I would have prefered a first edition. This one wasn't. Do you have one?? I am a first edition collector/reader.
2,My life with Marlene Dietrich.....,"At times this book was a good read.Then you get intricatedetails of Maria's life, hiding behind this legend is a little girl(&Tammi) wishing praise from the world in a book she wrote in order to fulfill her need to write about herself.Truthful and full of detail as it is.This book may captivate you,then may make you upset because you took the time to read...Marlene dedicated herself to her daughter,loved her! Maria managed her mother's professional life and experienced the up's and down's of legend.She deserves praise for this. For all of us we see fame as the ultimate way to cheat death.Marlene suceeded! In this we can see that this life is worthwhile discussing...Many of us may die alone,without legend.Another obituary,another face.Not Marlene!"
5,Marlene Deitrich,WOW! 800 pages.....I have only begun to dig into this book.....but it is worth it if you love bios and Marlene......
1,Another Bitter Daughter...,"Loretta Young, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, now poor Marlene. This is just another sad example of what happens when a star's daughter tries to become Mommy, cannot, and takes out her revenge in book form. Riva, lacking her mother's talent, dedication and smarts, instead penned this often self-contradictory memoir, full of mean-spirited attacks on her mother. Oddly, one comes out admiring Dietrich all the more. She was a nice person, a hard-nosed businesswoman, a brillant and versatile actress. But she certainly cannot have been much of a mother, as her daughter is a sad and sorry piece of work. Get this, if you must, for the photos, but take the ""facts"" with a grain of salt."
1,Most Annoying,"There are a great many reasons to dislike this book. It is badly organized, written, edited, and proofread. Perhaps the most annoying thing about the book, however, is Riva's inclination to use what is ostensibly a biography of Dietrich as a vehicle for Riva's own autobiography. I'm sure it comes as a bitter disappointment to Riva, but we're still not really interested in her."
2,Big disappointment :-(,"I just purchased the TDK S80s from [a local store]. After installing them (I am replacing an older 3-spk. set of Altec Lansings), I immediately started playing some songs. The sound quality of these speakers is passable at lower volumes but as soon as you try to blast it even a little bit the frequency response buckles. Treble is crackly as hell and bass is a lot muddier than I would have expected from such a cool-looking tube. I adjusted both my PC sound card settings, Winamp EQ and Bass/treb controls on the right speaker, all to no avail. I have an Audigy MP3 sound card, and just hooked my Altec Lansings back up. Now I have to box these TDK things up and take them back.I give these speakers a strong thumbs down."
5,An excellent study for 5th/6th graders,"We are using this book as the text for a class for 5th and 6th grade girls at church. They really love it and are absorbing the spiritual truths from it more completely than we ever would have expected.It is designed as an advice columnist. ""Letters from readers"" are presented and the portions of James that apply to the Biblical truths related to the questions and issues presented are studied. Then, the class ""writes"" a response incorporating those truths.The book looks fun and includes some crossword puzzles, opportunities to draw, etc and the kids love it, but it is also a quality Bible study that keeps the students interest and includes scripture memorization and application in situations the targeted age group can relate to. I fully recommend this book, or any of Kay Arthur's materials to anyone who wants a substantive but doable Bible study."
4,Not just for Aunt Mildred who likes to putter in the garden,"When my wife gave me this for Lent reading, I thought it was going to be just another cutsie gardening book sprinkled with a few feel-good quotes from the bible. Wrong! This isn't a gardening book at all. What it is is a guidebook for spiritual awakening to God within. I've read it once, and I plan to meditate on each of it's chapters in the weeks of Lent."
2,Advertising and Repeat Customers,"Having spent the time to find the specific title for which I was searching, I was pleased to have the opportunity to finally have this 'out-of-print' volume heading toward my home. Little did I know that the person writing the review for the sale item offered had taken liberties in their description of the book they were offering. The long and short of it was: 1) wrong book; 2) return process; 3) credit process; 4) desired book not available, and; 5) time wasted. The up-side: Customer Service was pleasant, quick, and accurate."
3,Red letter edition?,"Is the cover of the book burgandy or brown? Is it the red letter edition? How many pages does it have?Thank You,Rose"
3,A Great Album Called Devotion,As a lifetime fan and collector of John McLaughlin albums I am writing this review to warn those who are considering buying this album to instead purchase the remastered version of Devotion. Marbles is a 2006 release of all the songs on Devotion only in a different order. Beware of re-marketers.
3,hello Hollywood!!,This product runs a little on the small side so you may want to order a size larger...
5,A Classic,"Absolutely one of the best poetry books EVER for 9-12 year-olds! I had this one as a child and it has lost none of it's appeal for today's kids. The original edition was illustrated by Tomi Ungerer in 1964, and a later edition was illustrated by Shel Silverstein in 1977 (in which ""Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout"" the infamous garbage resister first appeared)."
5,Splendid,"This recording was made in 1984, rather early in the relationship between Previn and the Royal Philharmonic. They seem to have been sympatico from the word go. Previn's 1970's recordings of the Tchaikovsky ballets are considered classics in some quarters. I think the same holds true for this symphony. Previn has a beautiful sense of the ebb and flow of the piece, with the strings following his every nuance with full tone and great delicacy. The highlighting of the usually hidden brass parts is one of the great features of this reading, adding color and texture that is often missing from performances of this piece. When Previn reaches the development section of the fourth movement, the tempo really takes off, in a way that is reminiscent of Dorati's great Mercury Living Presence version. All in all, this has to be one of the best Tchaikovsky 5ths in the catalog. The 1984 engineering is very satisfying, too, rather veiled but full bodied and beautifully detailed."
4,Great Recorder,"Bought this for wife to record college lectures. Excellent quality of recordings (thanks to stereo mic's), easy to figure out most of the bells/whistles, and download recordings to her laptop is automatic, via the included software. Like any other USB storage device, you could also use it to store data files or music from any computer with a USB slot. I recommend this recorder."
3,Large but not huge,Bicycle shoe cages [Zefal L/XL Toe Clips] were (by design) large but not huge. I have need of a super large cage to accommodate a built-up shoe with an extra inch on the bottom. The pair of cages was adequate for large street shoes (size 14) but not for shoes with an extra inch of thickness. Size works well for the shoe size without the extra added sole that I have.
1,Death Trap,"In general, toe clips with straps are the perfect recipe to get injured if used on a mountain bike. A clip in shoe/pedal system is much safer but more expensive. Thanks to this product I ended up with more bumps/bruises and road rash than I've had since I was a kid. I have big feet and they never quite felt like they fit right either. After the third time I fell because I couldn't get my feet out of the toe clips I went down to my local bike shop and invested in a pair of clip in shoes/pedals. No falls since."
1,"If all music was this bad, I'd never buy another CD","I bought this CD after listening to Terrence Blanchard's brillant work on the Harrison Ford Movie Soundtrack. I was hoping to hear the beautiful music that was on that CD. I was however truly disappointed. There is no feeling at all in this CD and it sounds like the musicians are just playing to play without any emotion involved at all. I truly feel that I have wasted my money, and also am disappointed that anyone could possibly think of giving this CD more than 1 star!!!!"
4,Good ideas,"Common sense--- but often we do not think of these things with our busy lives.It is sad to have to be so wary but life is a crap shoot when it comes to crime possibly taking place, so prevention is the better option.this is all about prevention w/ a few self defense ideas.Nothing new here but overall a good read and practical."
3,Opponents Too Easy to Beat,"This game package has some good features: a wide selection of games, ease of use, and good special effects (although the opponent's dialog tends to be repetitive after a while). The main problem is that the playing ability of the computer opponents is only fair to poor, even at the ""expert"" level.This seems to be a common problem of games of this type. Special effects are becoming more and more spectacular, but computer opponent playing ability is not much better than in early DOS (and Apple II) games."
4,"A good companion to ""The Intelligent Investor""","This book was written by two (now wildly successful) fund managers. The prose and style is clearly mid-70s, but the advice is still sound.In particular, I liked the contrarian recommendation to buy companies w/ LOW margins. That accompanied with mean reversion of sectors gives you plenty of bang for your buck.The differentiation of economic and accounting earnings - I have yet to see this descirbed anywhere else. I also have yet to see a sell-side analyst understand this concept.There are also many good real world examples that we find occuring again and again and again and again....this alone makes it worth the read.That being said, getting through this was a slog. It felt too much like a dry text book. Maybe I am a victim of flashier editing that is in vouge these days...."
2,The Aggressive Conservative Investor,This book disappointed me after reading Martins letters. Although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. There are much better books on analysing companies I suggest Financial Statement Analysis by Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez.
1,Not as good as its reviews,"I bought this book because it was reviewed well. I have no idea who liked it, nor whom it is for. It's definitely not an investor's book, despite the title. It's more of a diatribe by the authors against Graham and Dodd -- go read that instead.It claims to be the updated version. The preface mentions Enron, but everything else is from the 60s and 70s, with examples of oil at $5 a barrel.Overall, it's a disappointment, with very little that's useful or interesting."
3,A true vulture makes Graham & Dodd look like amateurs,"This is a complete ""bible"" to valuing corporations for their investment merit. Too bad the man is so well known as a value investor, he should acually be referred to as the unscrupulous vulture investor, who knows no limits, no matter what the cost. Rasputin would have been proud."
4,Good overview,"This is a thoughful, well argued overview of critical issues. It covers a lot of ground, has strong opinions, a few really awful puns, and a great sense of humanity.It is a critical read for those ramping up to debate biotech or environmental issues."
5,This system rules,"If you have more than 2 TV's this is the system for you. I've got 4 DSS reciver boxes hooked up to mine and it's great. Also it is ready for the future. It points at 2 satellites, one gets you normal channels and the other gets the spanish channels, HDTV channels and some other stuff also. The price is a little high on this system, but the hardware required to enable a standard Dual LMB Dish to handle upto 4 TV's makes the price about the same. If you want to be ready for the future and you have more than 2 TV's then this is the system to get."
4,RCA delivers,"This is the DirecTV system for the future. The elliptical dish sees more satellites than the round ones, the receiver can service up to 4 TVs in your house, and the whole system is also ready for high-definition TV and digital sound. It comes with the familiar RCA remote, and we drive our TV, VCR and DirecTV receiver from the same remote. In terms of the remote there is a small glitch that pushing the DirecTV button will automatically send the TV to channel 39 (i.e. snowyland) if you point the remote at the TV as you do that (hence only 4 stars). After a few minutes of frustration the friendly people at DirecTV clued us in and straightend things out. The free installation was a great deal as well. Amazon contacted DirecTV, they contacted us a few days after the system arrived and a local contractor installed it completely to our satisfaction. So far we have been extremely satisfied with the system, picture and sound are 2 leagues above cable. We will never go back."
2,Comes in nice case to store in car but hooks are too small,Limited use unless you hook the strap on itself. The small end hooks wont go over anything substantial on the truck or trailer.
5,Simple and strong.,"I used these straps to straighten a maple tree that took a beating from Hurricane Sandy. Rope was simply stretching without moving the tree at all. The straps have very little stretch and appear very strong. The maple tree is now straighter, not perfect. Hopefully it survives the winter. Straps have been on the tree attached to a two ton capacity come-along-winch for one month with no issues. Good solid product. Highly recommended."
2,"Good strap, poor enclosure","The strap arrived in new condition and I imagine it will be useful if I ever need it to pull, or be pulled, out of a ditch/sand/snow. However, it came in a hinged case which looked quite worn, as if it had been hauled arouond and slid back and forth on some flat but abrasive surface. The hinge on the case was broken.If I were to order another strap, I would buy something different because this case was either defective or broken/returned without inspection -- or simply a bad design."
5,One of the most romantic movies I have ever seen.,"I loved this movie. My words will not even do justice to the highly intelligent, creative, romantic, sexy, and beautiful script. This movie left me breathless.I think it takes a special person to appreciate this movie, however it is one of the best movie's I have ever seen."
5,Perfect ! but where can i find the soundtrack?,this film takes you to a romantic world and effects you in a way that you..wacth it..a must see..and someone tell me where can i find the soundtack?
5,Resonant,"This was a profoundly original, compelling love story. I rented it a year ago and haven't been able to find it since. Why? It almost seems like contraband. Eric Schaeffer does it all...and it resonates for a long time. I hope it will be available soon!"
5,"The Most Romantic Movie EVER!, Eric Schaeffer is Brilliant!","Eric Schaeffer deserves more credit then he is given. His newest movie ""Fall"", starring Amanda deCadenet is his best yet. A love story of a supermodel and a cab driver, ""Fall"" has twists, laughs, and many tears. Schaeffer's poetry which he inserts in the script is phenomenal and is so romantic it makes you cry! . Its a great date movie, or a movie to watch on your own. Dont underestimate the talent and intelligence of Eric Schaeffer, or the independent movie industry. Watch this movie and you wont be disappointed."
5,A must see over and over and over and over again,"Not only did Eric Schaeffer do a wonderful job acting and directing in this movie but I keep trying to capture the words along with the music. I have not found a soundtrack but am trying to put my own together. It is a lovely film to hold onto and watch whenever you need to remind yourself that love, passion, and friendship can be found at your fingertips and then apply it to your own world. It reminds you that you have a life very much like that or can have one if you really want it."
5,Best movie of the year,"This movie was amazing. Eric Schaeffer (who directed, wrote, and starred in it) is gifted. The writing simply captivating. A real sleeper of a movie at the box office and video store, but it blew me away. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. The write up on the video box does this movie no credit -- there is so much more here than you would think, reading the captions and summary of the movie."
2,"""Fall"" from reality","The good: Eric Schaeffer is a talented director with an amazing eyeThe bad: the dialogue is so entrenched with his NY sensibility that it's hard to believe his characters are none other than extensions of his own psycheThe ugly: 90 minutes of an unbridled ego trip, which he doesn't seem to live down with any of his other films.A watchable film - but ulitmately its blatant flaw eliminate any empathy for any of the characters"
4,Fall for an Under-Rated Love Story...,"I shunned the movie before I saw it, based on the recommendation of my sister whose taste in movies is sometimes peculiar...And then I fell - in love with the dialogue, the mood, the relationship, and the possibility that someone (Eric Schaeffer) finally understood what ""love"" is / can be: attraction, humor, intensity, conversation and silence...I was lucky enough to find a previously viewed tape of this movie the day after I saw it. Ignore the critics who panned this film - I would recommend this movie to anyone who could appreciate the depth that love actually is..."
5,Forever,"Cigarette smoke curls to the ceiling, a glance from across the bar, a smile returned. Arms to shield me from the night. Another night without you. Lips to kiss, fingers to trace the lines of ones body. But not your lips, not your body. Where are you now to catch me when I Fall?"
5,very pleased,"I used to love to go out and experience the Star Room Boys when I lived in Athens, GA as a student at the University of Georgia. And now they have released a CD - and a very fine one. I just heard some on the computer and my own copy is coming in the mail as I write. In fact, I also just saw that they are playing tonight in Nashville (where I now live), so I am going out once again to see the Star Room Boys! I strongly recommend them to anyone (2-4-00)."
5,Best country record all year,"I bought Why Do Lonely Men... at a Star Room Boys show here in Atlanta, and I thought it would be good, just a nice record to have, something I'd listen to once or twice and then put on the shelf. For the next eight weeks, it was all I could do to take it out of the CD player and listen to something else. It's just exquisite."
5,#1 Fan from Louisiana!,"Even though I had the opportunity to meet a member of the band, and instantly met a life long friend. I did not realize that I would be listening to their entire CD over and over again on my 12 hour trip from Georgia to Louisiana. They have one of the most intriguing sounds I have heard in a LONG time, and they are becoming quite a favorite in my home town. Way to go Star Room Boys! Keep up the AWESOME JOB!"
5,"A monster can look very sociable, and yet","This film is rather important, even today. It is about the chase for a Nazi war criminal who has managed to erase his tracks and has emigrated to the US where he managed to integrate the good society of a small town. He was responsible for the final solution in one important concentration camp. The first idea that comes clearly from the film is that a criminal of that type can never reform and is a perverted mind and man forever. He has to be caught and neutralized. He has to be brought to court to answer for his crimes. The film is quite well done and the suspense is rather well built. The end is spectacular and very demonstrative of what such a criminal can come to if he feels menaced. Even love cannot erase his crimes and cannot make him come to terms with his responsibility because he has no conscience any more. To be shown to young audiences for them to see what war and fascism can lead to.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
5,INNERLUDE IS DAH BEST!!!!!!!!,SuP? I juss wanna Say dat I LUV this album I play this like 24/7. Even when I'm at School! This band should get exposure on the East Coast and I will back Dem up 100% I Luv Dem!!! @my
4,Asian Pride Back On Top,"Ay Sup Yall, Innerlude's Music With, is da shizznit, I ordered it off da net, its worth the money. I already heard some of their old songs...like about 4 or 5 of dem, Its has everythang from R&B, Reaggae, Rap, Slow jam, a lil acapella, got a duet. Overall, I just hoped it could've came out earlier with some bonus tracks or something, cause tha old song r old, but tha group and ttha album itself is tight... keep up tha ASIAN PRIDE -99-"
2,Not so impressed!,"I thought that a few songs were okay, but for the most part... Well, let's just say that the lead singer of most of the songs has that annoying ALL-4-ONE voice, like he's trying too hard (like he constantly had to push out his vibrato) and the music sounds too much like the instruments were recorded directly from a keyboard. I don't mean to be too harsh, but I really didn't like the CD at all. With all the 5 star ratings that everyone was giving them, I thought I'd take a chance and purchase it. Right after I finish with this review, I'm going to sell it back. I was really not impressed with Innerlude at all!"
5,AzNs starting somethang?,"Alright now, I know most of u Innerlude listeners prolly heard of Kai(Pinoy w/ a Chinese d00d), but Innerlude is just as good maybe even better because of their variety of songs. This CD is well worth it, great singers, and good people to get to know. I just hope people will accept Asians trying to play their game in the music industry just as they accept other r&b. Just a little somethang to think about...-OptionS"
5,GREAT!,"i recently bought this tv because i am redecorating my room and i saw it in a catalauge. i knew i could get it cheaper on amazon,com. i have a 20 inch tv in my room, but i wanted this one to place on my nightstand simply for decorational purposes. but i find myself using it while taking a bath, because it is fully portable, and our electricity went out, and it was perfect! i have to say that i am not surprised in the quality f this product because i own many GPX electronics and that is simply a wonderful company"
2,Not a good TAB book,If you're looking for the roundabout sound of Neil Young's songs then this book serves it's purpose. I've come across better Neil Tabs on the internet.
4,Great story of a different kind of company,"Here is the story of how two guys built a company that 1) Makes money, and 2) has a social conscience. It details the dilemna's, decisions, and trade-offs that Ben and Jerry's had to make between the myriad of forces that regularly tug at the company because of its mission, and the realities of the marketplace. For example, it shows how B&J dealt with their brownie supplier in inner city New York when the supplier couldn't handle the capacity and quality that B&J required.Very inspirational AND very pragmatic!"
2,A lot of unlikeable people.,"First Jill McCorkle book I've read & I won't look for others. Are these characters typical of North Carolina? Oh dear. What a lot of dismal, unlikeable people! I don't know what kept me up to page 112, but at that point, I realized that I was simply reading because it's what I do! But I still didn't care one jot what happened to anyone in the book, so that was enough. I had a bad taste in my mouth.I couldn't find a single character who speaks correct grammar, either. Gosh. My MOTHER was born in North Carolina, but as it happens, only because her parents were there at the time, & now I think it's just as well!The Cleveland Plain Dealer describes Jill McCorkle as ""the most exciting young American writer of fiction in years"". What a depressing thought. Maybe I'll stick with the classics, or British literature."
2,How much more wooden can characters get?,"Slaughter manages to write about some of the most dramatic events in American history without ever evoking a single emotion in the reader. The characters in this book are utterly wooden -- one doesn't even care when Stonewall Jackson dies, though this should be a central point in the plot. The author rarely describes any event from a character's perspective, preferring a distant third-person voice, and thus the reader cannot engage with the events. Deserving of two stars rather than one merely for the depth of research involved, this book is not really worth the reader's time."
4,Works great... but is heavy,"My TV is slightly different than this one in that it has a/v plugs in the front. Otherwise, it's the same thing. I got it for my dorm room at the beginning of this year... it took me awhile to get it to work with my cable and VCR, but once I settled all that stuff it worked great. Everything is crystal clear and the sound is great. I dont like the buttons on the remote, but that isn't a big deal. My TV has commercial skip, which I'm coming to love... and it has a sleep timer. That's pretty dang useful in a dorm room. I also love the design.. it looks spacey. The only problem I have with the TV is its weight. It's HEAVY! I think it weighs more than my mom's 19"" TV. Fortuantely I had a dolly when I was moving it into my room, or I would've had a difficult time. So, the weights the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,A Great Small TV,I am very happy with this TV. The picture and sound quality is great. I received it with no damage. It was packaged very well.
3,There are better collections available.,Disappointing collection of show tunes...there are better available out there.
5,True understanding,"Dr. Honda understands so intuitively what Dr. Suzuki was trying to accomplish with his Talent Education Movement. As a ""Suzuki kid"" turned Suzuki Violin teacher myself, I appreciated Dr. Honda's faithful and loving portrait of Dr. Suzuki and the early efforts in Matsumoto to bring Talent Education to the world. Thousands of children and adults all over the world, who have proved that ""Man is the son of his environment,"" have Dr. Suzuki AND Dr. Honda to thank."
5,Love Scotch tapes!!,I gave it an excellent rating as these came fast in the mail & on time. I use these tapes all the time so they came just in time for me to use for wrapping gifts. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Scotch tapes.
5,For use with these models:,"For use with Motorola: C250, C331g(GSM-without antenna), C332g(GSM-without antenna), C333g(GSM-without antenna), C350g, C370g, C650, T193, T193m, Talkabout T2200 series, V180, V220, V2260, V2267, V2282, V2290, V2297, V2397, and compatible phones."
4,Not a Review,"Just to point out that the current (Dec 2011) listening link is to the recording pictured (Harnoncourt conducting, Fischer-Dieskau singing Saul) not to the version conducted by Peter Neumann."
2,"Good selected plays, terrible narration","The problem with this product is that it a cheap direct transfer from a video to DVD product. I had seen this ""tape"" about 20 years ago and I thought that this Mexico 70 World Cup recap would be good.What I got was ""selected plays"", no complete games...just highlights of the Game of the Century and the Final.The narrator IS TERRIBLE!!!..my high school freshman son could do better.The company that launched this should have done a better job. What a wasted golden opportunity."
5,I love Caleca!,"This is my fourth Caleca pitcher. In addition to the intended purpose I use them as utensil holders near the stove, vases for casual bouquets, and as decorations on top of my cabinets. The hand painting gives an old world, artistic look to the pieces."
5,INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING,This applies to all the NOVA and NATURE PBS documentaries. Streaming movies and documentaries from Amazon is our most used entertainment by videos.
3,Braeker switches have a fixed current carrying capacity,The switch has two 30A circuits. I need two 15A circuits instead. All switches are fixed. I can't change them. I have to add extra fuse or sub panel for that. They should be replaceable.
3,Tales of Jungle Living in the Twenties.,I read this book many years ago so details are hazy.The book is the memoir of a yanqui who migrated to southern tropical Mexico in the twenties after the Mexican Revolution of 1910 finally ended. He was seeking his fortune but this is not a soldier of fortune story of fighting and mayhem. Instead it is one of physical adventure and settling down with his neighbors. Much on local people and their culture.Not highly significant but overall a pleasant read.
1,Not a good value,"Page count is inflated, Price is out of line for public domain item.Purchased for ease of reading and found that Plates (illustration) were deletedConversion from free pdf was poorly done"
3,Expensive way to learn monitoring,"I don't have a problem with the content of this book, but the price seems excessive.There are now more cost-effective ways to learn fetal monitoring.Check out the iPhone or Android app called FHR 5-tier."
3,Does the job,"Cap is a thin piece of stamped steel, has rough edges and a minimalist thin gasket. I don't count on it to last nearly as long as the car manufacturers factory part which has much better build quality. To get by for the time being at 1-2 years expected, this is useable."
3,Yes... but No!,"This is a beautiful book. The photography is truly amazing. However, I have found a number of inconsistencies and what can only be called mistakes in the recipes themselves. For example: in the Chocolate Caramel Puffs, the recipe claims that 1/8th of a teaspoon of lemon juice will make 1/2 cup of sugar look like ""wet sand."" Go ahead... measure it out and try it. As this is somewhat a central part of the recipe (and affects the caramelization of the sugar) the alterations necessary to achieve the desired consistency make following the recipe a bit difficult. I have noticed similar problems with other recipes, particularly ones that call for chocolate ganaches. I recommend it with hesitation, and should only be considered by expert cooks with a LOT of equipment."
2,Beauty is skin deep,"Such beautiful pictures, and they are great inspiration. Makes you want to spend the day in the kitchen. There it ends. I tried the white chocolate-candy cane recipe twice. It just doesn't work. We (I have a professional kitchen) added flour to make a manageable batter, but after baking could not get them off the baking sheet. More adjustments, and finally succeeded in making a cookie that no one liked. We also tried the two layer desert with brownie bottom. Expensive mess. The beautiful photographs are worthy of framing or put the whole book on your coffee table."
3,"Some great, some not so","I've had great success with the ""Chocolate Crack Ups"" and the Bengal cookies BUT have been stymied by the ""Chocolate Caramel Puffs"". Such an alluring recipe but the puff dough recipe is either way off (typo in the book?) or the instructions are incomplete. It turns out as a thin batter which couldn't possibly be spooned onto a cookie sheet in twelve level tablespoons without immediately creating one level lake of batter (not ""dough"" as it's described) on said cookie sheet. I've looked up ""choux pastry"" in another book and it shows a photograph of a shiny dough which holds its shape and the ingredients had proportionately less liquid. So disappointing!! I'll keep trying but what a waste of good butter and eggs! Still, I think this book is certainly worthwhile. I just wish I could find a corrections and ammendments page on the web for it."
2,Don't be fooled by the cover!,"I bought the book thinking that most of the cookie recipes would look as elegant as the one on the cover. Boy, was I mistaken. Most of the recipes are just common cookie recipes. For example they have a chocolate chip recipe and other that I already have. Only the last few recipes (the last 8) are creative ones. That includes the one on the cover. Which is the best looking one. Now when I say creative ones don't be fooled. They include a recipe for a pizza cookie, one that looks like flapjacks, an artist palette, spider webs and etc. Nothing to really impress people."
1,Absolute waste of money!,"I bought this cd just recently and I have to say I was very disappointed. Absolute Sting? Absolute joke I think is a better description. On the front cover it claims to be &#65533;The Unauthorised Interview&#65533; this is absolute nonsense! This isn&#65533;t an interview at all, what it is &#65533; is 30 minutes of snippets from past interviews and shows that Sting has appeared on, most of the content is taken from the VH1 &#65533;Behind The Music&#65533; show - which incidentally you can watch for FREE on VH1 next time its aired. You won&#65533;t learn anything here that you don&#65533;t already know and probably won&#65533;t hear anything you haven&#65533;t already heard. In my opinion there is nothing here for serious Sting fans. Quite frankly I could have put a much better cd together using the footage I have on video.Paul...."
2,NOT a very original plot at all!!,"Comedy, maybe? I do NOT really think it very funny except a few parts. The theme is, as has been done so many times, immigration fraud!! And it simply could not happen as it is shown because of MANY factual errors! The finace [K-1] visa MUST BE applied for in the USA after the USA citizen fiance returns, not at the USA embassy as shown. So NO you can not 'bring your fiance back with you!' Secondly it takes time--from the time I applied until my fiance got the visa in her country was a span of OVER 5 months [it may be longer now?]It is somewhat ironic that conditions in Belgrade appear to be BETTER than conditions in NYC, certainly cheaper! You wonder why people want to come here except the myth that the streets are paved with gold is far from reality. And will remain so until USA gets the debt under control. USA does not have the inflation of Serbia but the Serb did not have it good in NYC, IMHO!"
1,Picture blew after Six Months -- big disappointment,"Bought this tv in December. Initially loved it. Fun color, perfect size, etc. BUT THE PICTURE BLEW -- WITH SPARKS AND SMOKE -- AFTER JUST SIX MONTHS OF USE!! VERY DISAPPOINTING."
2,"Don't Go Back In Time, Move Foward","It's the year 2001 And we have lots electronic ablities. LET'S USE THEM!! I only gave the item 2 stars because it has the look of 2001, but as most of us should know looks aren't everything. If we have these tecnoligies we should use them. Why didn't you put color? Why not put black and white? Well most people these days I would say would enjoy siting down with a bowl of popcorn and watching a good movie on tv. (In color) People like it better because you can see more details. Like what kind of day it is. And what a beautiful blue (Color) the ocean looks today. I don't know about the rest of you, but from my point of view this item gets 2 stars."
4,Good size to take around with you,"This is a great compactable tv. You can take this around with you anywhere, even in the car on a road trip! You can also hide it in small places."
4,Standing Out AboveThe Rest,"Among it's era, Spiral Bridge stands tall as one of the best book during this period in Hardy history.. It was a rather unique volume with the first 50 pages being a volume in itself and the remainder a subsequent to the opening. By page 50, the brothers are at a Dead End thus the chapter ""Dead End"" is well named. The brothers were at a stand still in solving this case. After a brief 15 pages of little activity they head to Kentucky undercover at a construction site under assumed names using ""jailbird language"". I absolutely loved this book. It captured your imagination. They were in the great outdoors among the enemy (Sleeping With the Enemy) working side by side with the very criminals they intended to bring to justice. The book is packed with action & suspense. RATED B+"
4,I love how they named these books!,"This series was great for the fact that you could pick up a book and based on the name and cover art alone decide you just had to read it! I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom."""
1,Poor Quality Costruction,"I purchased this recoil to put on a 5hp Briggs engine that is mounted on a log splitter. After putting it on, the new one broke within 5 pulls because the two parts that engage the flywheel were made of plastic rather than metal like the old one was. Definitely not a part that should have been replaced by plastic. A waste of money."
2,took to long to receive my part,They took two weeks to proces my order. I was not happy with their customer service and was waiting a very long time to receive my part
1,Cheap,This product is poorly constructed. The arms that turn the crankshaft are cheap plastic parts. It broke after 2 uses.
2,Seller needs to tell facts.,"It is unfortunate that I had to give the game this rating. The game itself is great and gets 4 stars. But, when a game is bought as a Christmas present and the seller does not tell you that it will not work on the present operating system (Mac OSX 10.8), it leads to great frustration and disappointment. I have played the PC version of the game in the past, loved it, and this purchase was for my grandson."
1,"HP, what are you doing to yourself?","HP has degraded the quality of its once-excellent paper products to a deplorable degree. Their printable glossy greeting cards used to be about the thickness of commercial greeting cards; now they're barely thicker than plain paper. I won't be buying these again. If it doesn't bug you to give people really thin cards, these may be fine for you. But HP, please consider that some people would be willing to pay a little more not to have their efforts look cheap and amateurish."
5,Quite Wonderful,"Excellent performances of American works! The Quiet City is wonderful, and I think this is a remarkably atmospheric rendition of the Adagio. The Creston Rumor is a delight, and one of his less dated works.This was good on LP, and although the CD is a little bright, it is well worth the price of admission."
2,MarinePro 12V Coffee Maker,"Used once. Unit Blew a fuse. No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body. No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller. Had to calculate fuse rating.Unit is very slow to make coffee.Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles. Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place, has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle.No return information provded.Considering all the problems, I would not buy another product from this manufacturer, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Unit is overpriced."
3,A must read for scuba divers,"Burnsworth's account of the Wave Dancer tragedy in Belize is well written, thorough, and balanced. I found the writing to be lively and affecting. Burnsworth does an excellent job at leading the reader through the events as they unfold, capturing a lot of information without letting it become boring. The only caution I offer is that non-divers may not be interested in the story in spite of the writing. For scuba divers, this is a must read."
4,No Safe Harbor,"I read this book after having been on the Belize Aggressor Aug 2007, which was the boat that didn't capsize. It's a fascinating book, particularly if you've either been on one of the boats or are planning to be. One of the misconceptions I've seen in various writings is when a particular liveaboard is called a 'party' boat - I've been on many liveaboards and none of them have been party boats. After getting up at 6:00am everyday and doing a day's worth of diving, everyone generally goes to bed at a reasonable hour in order to be well rested for the next day. Who wants to be hungover when you've paid good money to dive in these exotic locations? If by chance, a boat becomes a 'party' boat, its because that week's charter is more interested in drinking than diving, and that hasn't been my experience on liveaboards. People go on liveaboards because they want to immerse themselves in scuba diving and the wonderful world that opens up to them below the ocean's surface."
5,Heart Breaker,Mr Burnworth has done a wonderful job with this difficult subject. He has certainly given those left behind a great gift in this book. It should be sold in every dive shop across the world and made required reeding for everyone in the sport.
4,Better than you think,"No one has more albums with the same songs on them than Nanci Griffith. I can think of at least 5 albums by Griffith featuring ""Trouble in the Fields."" This album, however, is different than all the others. It gives listeners a chance to here very different versions of her songs. The album succeeds. The added lyrics to ""The Wing and the Wheel"" are beautiful."
2,Her next album will feature all duets with Wayne Newton.,"This is beyond laziness, because it is crass and calculated. While her nasal vocals bother many from outside the Lone Star state, she always brought an intimacy to her songs, something lacking in the woodwind section of the London Symphony. I'm sure her next album will feature all duets with the likes of Wayne Newton, Englebert Humperdink & Tom Jones and, by the way, it will sell more units than any of her stellar releases on Rounder. She's lost her edge which often happens to great performers after they hit paydirt. Too bad."
3,"Standing still, beautifully.","The first four tracks are moving and beautiful. ""These Days..."" is a quiet, devestating improvement on the original. Elsewhere, the arrangements are a bit cluttered (""It's a hard life"") and ""1937 Pre-War Kimball,"" is a b-side if ever I heard one. Still, an enjoyable listen, and a must for Nanci fans."
2,disapointing and a waste of time,"This album is a great disapointment.It is a clumsy, stilted attempt at new arrangements of Griffith favorites.The idea of a Griffith-London Symphony Orchestra collaboration seemed promising, but Griffith tries too hard at re-interpertation, and the collaboration is an uneasy one.As good as these were, her last two albums comprised covers of material written by others.It would be nice to hear something new from Griffith herself.The original studio and live recordings of the material on the ""Dustbowl"", are so superior to this reprise, that one has to wonder why Griffith bothered at all."
4,Another Classic Put Forth by Amazing Griffith!!!!,"This is an essential Nanci Griffith CD. For me, I am taken back to the first time I saw her in concert in Seattle on Pier 62/63 on a rainy, summer night. For those who have not ever seen Nanci in concert, this CD is still worth purchasing, for it will transport you to a world where all is right with the world. This is truly an artistic accomplishment of which Ms. Griffith and the Blue Moon Orchestra should be proud. The lending of the London Symphony brings such legitimacy to music that, though not always commercially viable, is truly the greatest ever! Congratulations to Nanci and all the musicians involved in this wonderful production!"
5,Nanci's best recording yet!,"This is, without a doubt, her best recording yet. Tried and true favorites have evolved into masterpieces of both music and poetry. And, her voice is better than ever. This recording shows a maturity that inspires me to push the envelope and discover new horizons. Excellent!"
2,Inspirational but not Instructional,This book is in French. Someone did hack out a translation and have it printed at the back of the book but it's poor quality (think 1980s word processing) and you have to flip from the words to the pictures.The text itself isn't instructional. It's really more a showcase/review of the piece highlighted. The pieces are creative and beautiful but this is not the book for someone without expertise in the field.For the price I expected a more of a textbook. And that's really the disappointment - the more than $80 spent (and the month wait). For the first time I'll be returning an Amazon book.
5,It did the job,"I purchased this in hopes of cutting through my factory exhaust pipes on my 2003 Dodge Ram. I was a little weary that this tool would have issues cutting through the thick walled exhaust on the factory exhaust system, but I was proven wrong. The key to not over-working your arms and fatiguing is to use long smooth turns while gripping the tool in a way that creates a tighter cutting pressure against your pipe. I was able to cut through my exhaust pipes in 4 locations without issue, even the older rusty pipe. If you are looking to cut any type of exhaust pipe without using a saw this is the tool for you."
4,Shake it baby,This is the second album by that weird band from Montreal. They are a little like The Unicorns. They are older and probably take LSD. Their first record was uncompromising. The second one has more pop songs and potential singles. There is a lot of freaky artwork in this record. I am not sure if this is a pop band or what. I am going to see them play at CMJ this year and I'll let you know what I think. They are too good.
1,Don't work with Video iPode,"I bought these on another site that said they work with ""iPods"". Well, they only work with the old versions and do not fit into the video iPod. Just a simple warning."
1,"Good sound, extremely fragile headband","Loved the headphones but after only three weeks a crack appeared in the headband. Despite extreme care the headband snapped four weeks later. Worse yet, the headphone wires run through the headband and broke when the headband snapped making the headphones useless. I am very disappointed with this product."
2,I wanted to like them,"I was very excited to get bluetooth headphones, so I wouldn't have to constantly plug and unplug things into my laptop. However, you can't use the built-in bluetooth -- you have to use the Logitech adapter, plugged into the headphone jack. Then you must turn it and the headphones on at the same time and sync them. Not as simple as my wireless keyboard and mouse!Even worse, the headphones are not adjustable. They are rather heavy for headphones, and they squeeze my head so tightly that I get a headache after just 15 minutes. I can't believe there's no way to accomodate different size heads!So, my search for the ultimate headphones continues."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A NEW iPOD!!!,"The controls that let you skip forward or backward through songs DO NOT WORK if you have a new iPod, there's a little tab that will only fit into old iPods. Not only that, but that little tab will prevent the adaptor from plugging into you iPod, so you'll have to use another included wire just to plug it into your iPod. It's a little cluttery. Also, the headband of the headphones are not adujustable, and do not fit exactly right, at least for me."
1,"Unbelievably fragile, terrible design.","Loved these when I first got 'em. Not bad sound at all, and a decent range. I used them maybe 5 or 6 times, with the iPod, as well as a CD and Cassette walkman. Move over sliced bread, WD-40 and those leetle cup-holders for your car window, this was a great invention... until after only a few, very gentle uses, the connecting band on the headphone cracked. In about 3 places! I tried to tape it up, but JEEZ, people, this is the member that supports the entire headphone. Once cracked, the phone is a flabby mess, and is useless. Who cares how cool it is, if it lasts so short a time? This product needs, and is worthy of, a complete redesign. A setup so versatile and functional shouldn't be hobbled by being so fragile. Beef it up, Logitech, and I'll buy it. Fortunately, Amazon has a very fair refund policy, though I might question why they're still selling this white elephant (which also comes in black, I understand)."
2,ipod - mini not nano,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the product description carefully enough before purchasing. These headphones are only compatible with the original ipod or ipod mini. They do not work with the nano. So, I can't say how they work, only what models they are supposed to be compatible with."
2,A Certainty for Breaking into Pieces!,"It was great at first until the connector to iPod break by itself. The bluetooth signal wasn't the best, it loses signal constantly. I had to re-sync and paired it up several times over a month period. The high price iMuffs MB210 from WI-GEAR gives a better promise with the ability to stop your iPod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone. Its Bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on iPods with dock connectors, likely will not break as easily. I sure hope Logiteh will follow suit in this trend."
4,Great for the money,"I got these headphones 2 weeks ago and they are great, they have a 30ft. range and a relitively long battery life. The only downer is that it takes a couple of seconds to connect the two bluetooth devices. The battery charges quickly and they are pretty comfortable. They can get to be irritating while listening for over and hour, but if you take they off or adjust them them feel great again. They do not fall of your head easily wither."
2,You do not get what you pay for...,It does not fit into an IPOD. I have had problems since day one and would not tell anyone to buy this product. The instructions do not explian to the full extent.
2,SHORT RANGE,"AMAZING TECHNOLOGY BUT IF I COULD I WOULD RETURN THEM. THE RANGE IS LESS IF YOU GO INTO THE NEXT ROOM WITHIN 20 FEET, THE HEADPHONES CUT IN AND OUT. THE UNIT DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE IF DISCONNECTED FROM THE CHARGER OVERNIGHT."
4,Great when paired with iPod but cannot pair with anything else,"I actually think these are really good headphones and they sound great. They pair easily with the supplied BT adapter that fits the iPod. It's really cool to go to the gym and put my iPod down somewhere, yet still be connected.However, I was hoping I could pair the headphones with my D-Link BT adapter DBT-120 on my Mac (I researched and read this could be done after applying a firmware update to the Dlink adapter). Sadly I report they will not pair. It would've been great to walk around the house and listen to my Mac's iTunes wirelessly or play video games and have wireless audio privacy.But otherwise these are good headphones and work great."
4,"Works well, sounds good, use carefully","I have been happy with sound, convenience, and ease-of-use with these headphones. As noted in the other reviews they are fragile, so be careful when putting on an off your head. They are great for workouts; no wires to dangle or hit, and I can leave the iPod in the corner of the room and go anywhere. It has remarkable distance depending on the construction of the walls."
1,Broke for me as well.,Had this product for one month and it just broke today. Class action lawsuit? I think so. Other than that im loving the sound and wirelessnes. Enjoy.
1,Logitech Wireless are very uncomfortable,This headphones are the most uncomfortable I have ever tried on. They were so bad I never even tested them out to see how the music sounded. They are made of hard plastic with a tight fit and no way to adjust the pressure. I was very surprised that Logitech would produce just a terrible product.
3,Similar Product?,I saw these wireless headphones advertised recently in a magazine and was really excited about them -- until I read all the reviews about them not being adjustable and the headband snapping easily. Has anyone come across a similar product they would suggest instead?
3,"Never tried these myself, but Walt Mossberg panned them","His review in the WSJ mentioned that they worked well, but because they don't adjust and the behind-the-head design does not carry the weight on top of the head, they kept tending to slip off. You might want to check out the WSJ review (or one of the many reprints) before spending this kind of $ on headphones."
4,How White is it Really?,"i ordered this for my son, and, i havnt used it yet, but i have one concern...the headset is more of a mid to dark gray rather than a nice white color. Is this the same for everyone? The picture of the headphones on the back of the case is even white. Did they run out of white plastic, or wuts going on?"
3,Great Sound - Volume controls don't work,"The product produces great sound. Having internal re-chargeable batteries does not draw power from the IPod such as my ITrip does. The skip forward/backward and pause controls work, but the volume control does not. I have read other reviews, and I am not the first to experience the problem."
3,They are OK.,"I love not having to deal with a headset cord! The sound quality is also pretty good. However, they are not very comfortable. Because they are not adjustable, they don't fit my head very well. They slip down on my ears when I'm running and I find I'm continually adjusting them. An hour is the max that I can wear them at one time because they hurt my ears. If Logitech would address the comfort issue on this headset, they would have a heck of a product."
2,Broke for me too,"I am now on my third pair of headphones, I guess I am a sucker for technology.Reasons I love them, for some reason they seem to have better speakers than headphones with wires. They are convenient and easy to use. Great for the gym unless you are leaning back.Reasons I hate them, the band is cheap and cracks very easily (I have a medium head)The adapter is very heavy, and spins my IPOD, a pain when running through the airport.The head band is not adjustable, one size fits all does not work for some people.Outside of that I happen to like them, I am saddened that I am on my third pair, but I plan on sending this set to Logitech for repair instead of paying out of pocket."
1,This headphone has the shortest lifespan,"I see many people mentioning their headband breaking.Mine cracked after less than 2 weeks of very gentle usage. I haven't even removed the thin plastic covering on the headphones yet. I feel utterly betrayed by Logitech. How can they continue selling this product that clear has a severe design flaw? I even wrote positive things about the headphones on my blog, only to find out that it's become useless few days later!People must read this!DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU PLAN ON USING THEM FOR MORE THAN A MONTH."
1,YES IT BREAKS -- DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS. I bought the equivalent black model (non-iPod) of this. It worked great, but sad to report, just as others are, that the headphone arch does indeed break (after about 6 weeks for me). It cracks at the midpoint of the arch, where it flexes.INEXCUSABLE! The high-tech part works, but the product is ruined by the cheap plastic and shoddy construction. What a shame.DO NOT BUY THIS. If you're giving this away as a present, be sure to include a roll of duct tape with it, it'll be needed very soon."
2,Another Broken band,Two have broken within 3 weeks each.Everything was very good about the device except for the band.Unfortunately once the band cracks it damages the cabling inside which makes the device useless.
1,"Two units bought, two units failed","I bought these on a Woot deal a few months ago. Unfortunatly, I never got to use them long enough to see of the headband would break. The transmitting unit on both headsets failed within days. Great idea, terrible product."
2,not that great product,"Good things I have to say about this product:Had a long battery life, and nice range. I could clearly listen to my music a good 25- 30 feet away. and somewhat comfortable fit on the ears.Bad things:I was disappointed to find that this product broke within a week of me owning it. It did not have the ability to contour to my head, resulting in it eventually breaking in half.And, After trying to tape together it would eventually not receive a signal.So conclusion: great reliable sound. But only buy if you have a perfectly shaped small head."
2,Great Idea; Horrid Manufacturing,"I picked up a few of these for my family because we were intrigued by the idea of having some wireless headphones. We work out often, and being able to hook up the headphones, and leave the MP3 player safely locked in a locker or somesuch is quite appealing. While they worked like that for a while, we discovered they cracked. Quite easily. I believe as of this writing we have snapped/cracked all four pairs we purchased, maybe excepting one. Either way, a bad product. While it would be nice to see some good Wireless/Bluetooth headphones for MP3 players, these are not it."
2,"All of the Above - Good Sound, Easy Break","I was able to buy these cheap knowing the headband could break easily. I though if I was careful putting them on and taking them off, I would be okay. Nope. Over a period of time, they slowly crack right in the center of the headband. The sound quality was excellent.Also keep in mind, they are not designed for the iPod video. You have to use an included adapter cable that runs out of the iPod into the transmitter. So that means that you cannot easily carry on your arm or waist because of the room the transmitter takes up.Sorry guys, they are great, but they break too soon and if you use it with an iPod, you have to readjust other factors."
2,Non-Adjustable !! 3+ stars,"I like the wireless headphones, but I am constantly pushing them up on my head and repositioning them. They are suppose to fit behind your head, but on my head they slip down . They do not grip around my ears tight enough due to being too big. I have to wear them a little bit up on the back of my head. They are NON adjustable . That seems INEXCUSABLE for a product in this price range. This is not a cheap headphone and a simple adjusting headpiece would have made a big difference. Some have complained about the weight, but I don't feel the weight is as much of a problem. Otherwise I like them alot. I do like the features on the earpiece."
1,"Good idea, bad execution","The idea of wireless headphones seems good, but these had the following problems:1. Too heavy2. Pinched my head3. Dropped the connection often with re-syncing difficult after the headphones and receiver had been synced once. (Cycling the power on both units was the ""easiest"" solution.)4. Battery longevity leaves something to be desired.I wouldn't buy them again, and I would test any more out before I bought them."
3,I was deceived. Read the FINE PRINT!!!,"I was deceived. I thought that the headphones would work on an iPod Video. Evidently I didn't read the fine print, because it didn't work. I sold them to my father who used them on his iPod and loved them, but I was extremely disappointed that they didn't work on my iPod."
2,not built for the long run,"I loved the headphones for the first few weeks, I didn't mind that the connection wouldn't allow me to control my 30 mb ipod, I really liked the convinence of the volume control alone on the headphones. Then the head band cracked and they stopped working all together. I would never have classified them as comfortable, but they sounded great and were very convinient. Unfortunately they didn't work out for me, but a great idea!!"
1,Still Waiting,I have not yet received this after ordering it more than a month ago. I've emailed the company and they have not even responded.
1,Craptastic,"Do not buy this product if you intend to ever take them off your head. I used these at work to listen to music. The head band eventually split halfway and the sound stopped. For a pair of headphones intended for portable use I seriously question logitech's choice to put their good name on this crappy product. I used these for at least 8 hours a day for about a month... then kaput...Even when they were working the connection was at times difficult to establish. I'd have to sit there for five minutes sometimes, holding the buttons, waiting for the connection.The sound was decent, but not worth the headache..."
5,perfect,this item is perfect for your ipodit works good and its easy to use cause you have controls in your headset
2,"Headphone band cracks right away! Great sound, glue a stiffener.","They sound great but I would have some problems with them linking up and had to run them through there ""repair"" cycle quite often, especially if I paused them long enough for the auto shut off to activate.The big problem is that after two weeks of use the middle of the UNADJUSTABLE ONE SIZE FITS ALL HEADBAND BROKE. I first noticed it cracking, then they stopped working, and by the time I was putting them into a box to ship them back to the eBay seller I bought them from the headband was completely broken. I'm not sure if the crack was the cause of them not working anymore or not.I have a replacement pair coming and intend on gluing a stiff piece of metal to the plastic to keep it from breaking again.I must say though, they had a great sound up until they broke."
2,"Shows flash of brilliance, but breaks down too easily","Easy to setup (for both IPod and computer), great sound, long battery life, free of interference... this wireless headphone had been a perfect choice when it was new.However, after one month in use, the plastic band of the headphone breaks, even though I took special caution in handling after reading about the same problem from other reviewers. I stuck them back together into a barely wearable state. It worked for another 2 months before it completely broke down - it just would not turn on anymore.Very poor quality."
2,Problems,"I really like the features of these headphones, however I have had nothing but problems with the charging aspect. After using the headphones for about two weeks, the adapter would no longer charge. Amazon replaced the item. After using the headphones again for about two months, the headset stopped charging. Due to a mix up in the way the first headset was replaced, I believe it to be Amazon's policy that they will not replace the second headset or refund my money. I spent a lot of time on Logitech's website trying to find an answer to no avail. I intend to contact them to see if they will honor their warranty, but have not done so yet. In conclusion, it is a great idea, but I believe there is a bad flaw in the battery recharding process in both units."
1,It breaks easy,"Well I bought it last year, but after 10 months or so of using it. It broke and is also uncomfortable when you wear it. It has a good quality of sound, and the battery life is great but it takes a while to find the blue tooth device."
3,"Great Sound, Cheap Plastic","I got the headphones and was excited about using them, and they didn't disappoint. After almost 5 hours of mountain biking, they were still going strong. The sound quality was great. They did feel warm on my ears, which wasn't great on a hot day. When I took them off at the end of my ride I found that the plastic band had cracked. Someone else mentioned this in their review."
2,Doesn't work with the latest iPods,"I ordered these headphones with great anticipation. I had read a review of them in PC Magazine, and thought they would be the perfect solution for my work music needs... I move around a lot in a large cube, and like to leave my iPod on the desk.Imagine my disappointment when I got the headphones, only to discover that they will not work with either iPod I own - an iPod Nano and a 60GB Video iPod. These headphones only work with the older type of iPod that has a little extra plug next to the headphone jack.I was able to use them - sound only, no controls - by plugging in the included extension cable. But since the main reason I wanted these was to be able to pause and unpause music directly from the headphones, I reluctantly sent them back.So - fair warning to owners of the newest iPod models: These don't work. Wait until Logitech comes out with a revised model."
2,"Great Service, Bad Manufacturing/Design","Well like a lot of the other folks who've posted, this is a really great service. I'm surprised there aren't more products on the market like this. The manufacturing and design of the headphones however is severely lacking. After only having this product for 5 months, the back of the headphones have cracked.I just got off the phone with the customer service folks and as long as you have the receipt they are refunding money and not replacing them at all. I think there are too many fundamental flaws with the design."
1,Beware of the cheap plastic!,"The sound quality and iPod control of these headphones are great. However, the plastic started cracking within about two weeks. Consider other wireless headphones."
1,Breaks easily,"this was not what i expected, it worked fine the first few weeks and then i noticed that hte headband seemed to have a crack in it, considering that i have a smaller than usual brain pan its not cos im stretching it or anything and it lives in my drawer when im not using it so its not like its being pushed around a lot either. the thing broke within 60 days of buying it and both logitech and the company i bought it from wouldnt fix or replace it.When it was working it had good audio quality and the controls worked fine, i found myself reverting back to the earbuds that come with the ipod cos basically they are cooler but its nice to be able to roam around and not worry about wires."
5,"Be warned, does not work with 5G iPod","If you are like me and do not read the details, be warned that the bluetooth adapter that comes with these headphones do not work with the 5G (video) iPod."
1,i have these in black,works awesomely but several days of using them the middle of the headband started to break and 5 min later totally broke in half leaving them non useful
1,Headbands Cracked for Me Too,"I was given a pair of Logitech wireless headphone as a gift and loved using them with my iPod. The headband very quickly cracked and the whole headset stopped working. I loved all other features so much that I bought a second pair and tried to reinforce the headband with electrical tape right out of the box. This did not help as they headband on pair #2 cracked as well. Once cracked the wires stretch and break and the headphones then become worthless. Too bad, except for this flaw these are great headphones."
1,Headband has broken,"I read the reviews before I bought them - I thought I would be extra careful and that they would not break. Bought them in late November, 2005 they broke on Friday, March 3, 2006. They lasted a little over 3 months - but I only use them maybe once or twice a week. I liked them otherwise. Logitech told me that would replace them - I will wait and see if they do. The bigger questions is, will they continue to replace them?? Have they eliminated the obvious design flaw?? I am not apt ot buy another Logitech headset. Otherwise I like them.I paid $139.99 because I bought them when they first came out. I see now after rebate they are only $50 - that drastic price reduction must be telling us something."
2,"Great Sound, Bad Design",The sound quality is great and the wireless controls for volume and such are excellent. The headphones are easy to setup and use.But a major problem is the headphone design. It is made of plastic and within a week's use the headphone band had cracked a little (not completely in two). In a few months' time I'm afraid the band will be completely snapped in two.Wait for a better design for bluetooth wireless headphones. I would not buy these again.
1,Another cracked band ... major flaw,I bought this from an online auction site and it arrived with a cracked band. Stay away from this model ... look for a headset with a non-plastic headband. You've been warned.
2,"Yes, it's wireless, and that's about it.","I had same compatibility issue, since I've got a 30GB video ipod, and therefore had to use the odd adapter contraption. Furthermore, these headphones are kinda heavy and slid off my ears a lot. Seems like they tried to compensate for that by making the fit very tight, which made my ears hurt after 20 minutes of wear."
1,Don't get these headphones,"Great idea, horrible follow through. The headphones fit fine, but the bulky device that hooks up to the iPod is useless. Wait until they come out with a proper connection for G4+ iPods. I returned mine."
2,alright for a while,"These headphones a great while they work. Unfortunately, my first set just stopped working and I got a free replacement but on those ones, the headband cracked. Overall, the sound from them was great. Also, the functions controlled the ipod really well and I would say that if you are very careful with them they are worth the money."
3,OK,I love the functionality of the equipment. It however doesn't fit with the video ipod without using the adapter cord with means i don't have control over the ipod. the headset itself seems to be breaking but hasn't broken completely yet.
2,Yes they break,"What a shame - read the reviews and chanced my arm - however the first ones (black non-ipod) broke within 2 weeks use, at the apex of the headband v.v.poor.Logitech replaced them with the white ipod ones, not what i wanted, so beware when specifying a replacement to make explicit which model you want, but I can't be bothered to send them back.However Logitech replaced them without question, which was good. But I'm off to buy some superglue and something to reinforce the headband.There are 3 wires in the headset one/all of them fracture when the crack traverses them - but they can be soldered together again, will probably do so and put them to use somewhere dark."
1,Headphones Break,"Nice idea, works great until they break. Mine broke after a few weeks of use. Clearly a design flaw yet Logitech keeps selling these defective products. Any information regarding class action lawsuit?"
3,"Great, but...","These are excellent headphones, which is not something one might readily glean from my 3-star rating. The sound quality is very good, setup and opperation are extremely simple, and the iPod controls on the earpiece are a great feature.Unfortunately, I have a very big head, and I found that they were much too tight for me. Wearing them for more than around twenty minutes hurt my ears. I tried to shift them around into a more comfortable position, even tried leaving them wrapped around the top of my head for a few hours in the hope that they might stretch a little bit. I wanted to be able to use these very much, but in the end, the discomfort prevailed and I had to send them back.If you have a large head, hold off and hope that the next version - if there ever is one - is adjustable. If you have a normal sized head, then these are an excellent purchase, especially now that they're down to $99."
2,"Yay for Wireless, but BAD for comfort and weight","This is a great wireless product that is long overdue...BUT the comfort factor is quite bad. I'm a 5'6"" person, and the headphones were too big and too heavy. I could have ignored the too big part...but the heavy weight of them was just too much. So I returned my headphones, and will wait for a second version that will hopefully be smaller and lighter. I hate having to return these, as I really love the freedom of being wireless...but at $150, they need to be more comfortable."
1,Awful awful product UGHHHHHHHH,"I was so excited to paint outside with my new wireless headphones. Charged them up last night. Turned them on. Wow, sounds great. Next day, hike out to where I'm going to paint. Set up. Go to turn on my headphones...nothing. what a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! Get home charge them (to make sure it wasn't that, it wasn't) These things are worthless, cheap, and a waste of money. UGHHHHHHHH. PS. I rarely see a product get so poor reviews."
2,Good sound BAD CONSTRUCTION,"I bought these headphones about 2 years ago, in short words i had the same complaint than the other customers, !!!The headband broke right at the middle within a month of use!!! Altough the sound quality is impressive the construction is realy bad, otherwise it would be an excellent product."
5,Great Book,"Most books I buy there may be one or two pages you like, but the rest is a dud. This book has beautiful pictures and great home decor ideas. Many different styles."
4,This is a very interesting reading...,"for those, including myself, with limited knowledge of the Middle East and Islam. The author poses a very interesting question, does an Islamic government hinder economic development? By reading this book, I learned a lot about the far-reaching influences of an Islamic government in the Middle East on its people and their lives. Viorst provides plenty of evidences to answer the question above."
5,"An Excellent Sampler, and the Best Place to Start","If you're unfamiliar with Nyman and want a broad overview of his best work, I'd start here. I actually WORE OUT a copy of this and recently bought another. When it arrived, I played it over and over-- Nyman's almost creepily insistent and precise compositions will appeal to those who appreciate minimalism and repetition in the music of other composers such as John Adams, Steve Reich, Michael Torke, and Philip Glass."
2,The Emperor's New Music,"A lot of people seem to love this guy and I just don't see why. I find it dull, intellectual (in the most pejorative sense) and defines what's wrong with a lot of ""post-modernism"" in music today. This guy doesn't write tunes as much as he writes concepts of tunes. The music fails to connect on an emotional level and fails to be interesting enough in purely intellectual terms to compensate for it's emotional hollowness. His craft seems a bit lacking too- filled with the trappings of minimalism without the basic musical values such as memorable melodies, logical harmony and innovative form that make a composer such as John Adams worth listening to. His often odd choices of orchestration tend to strike one as merely grotesque rather than imaginative. I'm afraid that Michael Nyman is a musical poseur and it's a shame that so many people have bought into his brand of soulless artifice.Not recommended."
4,Works. And it's clear.,It seemed to disappear quickly though. I'm not sure if it's shorter than other rolls.
2,Only useful for light colored objects!,"I bought this duct tape on the premise that it's transparent and not very noticeable on things you put it on. All the reviews I read seemed to back this up. The tape has a diffuse transparent appearance, which would be fine, except for all the white filament running through it. Basically if you put this on something light colored it works well. It's still noticeable because it reflects light different than most objects, but that's to be expected from any kind of tape. However, as soon as you put it on anything dark colored it's very noticeable and ugly. I'm going to add some product photos to illustrate how it looks on different surfaces."
5,"Good stuff, 20yards of mostly transparent duct tape","First the transparent part, it blends pretty well on most items I've used it on. So this is especially good for repairing stuff around the house. It's much more expensive than the regular duct tape, so I'd save it for cosmetic fixes. It's quite useful for small plastic trim pieces in older cars. Blends in pretty well and holds well.The duct tape part, well, it claims to last 6x as long as traditional duct tape (the package says ""based on accelerated aging tests""). I don't verify the factor of six, but the tape does seem to hold up pretty well.If you need a roll of duct tape for cosmetic work, then this is your tool of choice.Consider also the very small, <$2 rolls for a single project."
3,Warning: Product does NOT make you transparent as well,"I don't know what I was thinking. You could easily see through this strong duct tape, and after six whiskey sours and a bottle of Old English malt liquor, I somehow thought it would make me see-through as well. Needless to say, people could easily see me, including the women's volleyball team over in the showers on campus. I am now the subject of a court order that prohibits me from watching college sporting events and I'm also still trying to remove this duct tape from some rather sensitive areas. From what's come off with the removed tape, I'm not exactly sure if I can still have children.Great if you need to see what you've stuck it on. Not so great if you want to procreate."
2,NOT transparent,"This is nice quality tape but nowhere near transparent. If you put it on a dark surface it looks white. Translucent yes, transparent no way..........."
2,"Disapointing, difficult to use`","Not only was this tape not transparent, but it was very difficult to unroll and keep it from folding onto itself in places.I have been using the same size rolls of Scotch transparent tape for years. These fits into a plastic dispenser which makes it easy to wrap right onto a package, and then use the edge to tear it off.I tried this tape by itself and in a dispenser, but had the same trouble trying to keep it from folding over and sticking to itself. I have wasted a lot of pieces trying to get just a flat piece onto a package. Once it is gone, I'll go back to the thinner but easier-to-use transparent tape."
3,Not very Transparent,The duct tape was not really as transparent as I had hoped it to be. The white fibers really made it stand out.
4,Tahiti in Dances,"I purchased this item for a summer Labor Luau, and enjoy Tahitian culture. This cd captures the essence of the traditional Tahitian dance energy, and sends the listener to a subliminal vacation to the islands."
2,MUNDANE,"Who knew that the old addage ""write about what you know"" would be taken sooooo literally. I listen to alot of different kind of music and have heard my share of self-obsessed songwriters. Many of whom have the artistic talent for taking private moments and making them seem universal (Meshell Ndegeocello, for example). This is NOT one of those cases. I'm glad that this songwriter is happy and I'm glad the hard times are over, but to be frank, I don't need to hear you sing your Daytimer, which is what much of this sounds like. Musically, the album is average, rarely catching fire. Whatever passion there may have been in this project has been suffocated under the weight of the mundane."
4,Great Effort!!,"I purchased this CD after seeing her perform in NY at madison sqaure garden on April 2000. She was there opening for Rock legend Tina Turner. I must say that i enjoyed her music. It's original and different...its a shame she is not getting more attention...but she did get alot of exposure touring with Tina Turner this year(2000). If nothing else this CD brings back great memories of Tina Turner in concert on her current ""twenty four seven"" tour...if anyone has been to one of the shows this album is great to have just for that..as it takes you right back to the night of the concert. If you have not seen her on tour with Tina this is still a good cd to own because the songs are great."
3,Is this actually for real?,"This album is very deceptive for starters. The first single ""Nothing I Would Change"" is so amazing. The beats in the music rock, and the message is crystal clear. Robinson affirms her womanhood and individuality. This song is the only reason this cd even gets 3 stars. The rest of the songs fall into this disgustingly boring trap of sacharine lyrics and meaningless songs in general. This CD could have very weel produced a soundtrack wonder. ""Nothing I Would Change"" could have ended up on a soundtrack and been a hit, but Robinson ruins her credibility as an artist with the rest of the junk on this album. I highly recommend passing on the album and buying the single because it is awesome."
2,I don't like it,"It is not sturdy enough to hold the initial position and when the wind blows it sideways it doesn't look good at all. Also looks like the hummingbird is diving into the leaves, not the flowers."
2,Pinwheel,"This was kind of cheasy. at first it sat up nice n' pretty, but after a summer of light breezes it kept coming apart, and then the the thing just blew up and disinergrated all over the yard... my lawn mower didint like that, but the dogs did."
3,kentucky fried,As an artist I was hoping for a bird reference showing not only varied anatomy and birds from various angles but instead I get pieces of a bird without a complete picture. Not real helpful..
4,Good Quality Oil Filter,I have used Fram for years. Always had a good experience with their products. This item fits my Dodge RAM 1500 5.2L (318 cu in) engine. The black topped rubber-ish grip makes it easy to remove and install this filter.
1,"unreliable readings, can be troublesome to reset","I don't expect this to be super accurate (funny that they actually display a decimal place on the temp -- precision without accuracy!!). But when you have two receivers sitting side by side, reading from the SAME sensor, and showing temperatures 3 degrees (F) apart, you might question if either one is right. Two sensors in the same place will show different readings as well. So sticking your hand outside might be more reliable.Resetting them is painful: if you change a sensor battery, you may have to go reset all the receivers, because they gave up listening for that sensor when it died. If you change a receiver battery, you may find yourself grabbing all the sensors and receivers and going through several reset cycles in order to get them all to be friends again.And the coup de grace: they don't last long, maybe 2-3 years if you're lucky, after that the sensor's signal seems to become too weak. Mine are now not receiving from 50 feet away.Avoid."
2,Took a while for Weather station to synch with Sensors - ONLY captures Temperature NOT Humidity,"Initially had difficulty getting the Weather Station to synch with the Sensors.Tried emailing Oregon Sc, then calling them on the hotline when a week passed and no reply.Seems to me this is a commom prob, so much so that there is a dedicated option to hear the trouble shoot.What you need to do is to reset the weather station, the way it's done is to remove all the batteries and wait 10mins.Then make sure you insert batteries in the Sensors FIRST AND RESET IT/THEM, then place the batteries back into the Weather Station AND RESET AS WELL.Resetting the Weather Station is a bummer as one needs to then reset all the settings.At least finally, I got it to work after trying again (after multiple times) and ignoring it only to find later that it is working.Only thing is this sensor only picks up the temperature and not the humidity. Should have paid attention to the description.A little disappointed."
1,Temperature AND Humidity Sensor,"The wireless sensor was supposed to give a temperature reading and a humidity reading. Unfortunately, although the temperature reading worked correctly, I never got a reading for humidity. It still does not work properly."
3,Receiver batteries can be the problem,"R. Whitaker is correct about the receiver batteries needing to be in good shape for this unit to communicate with it. I had mine sitting right next to the receiver and it still would not communicate. The red LED was flashing about every two minutes which seemed to indicate that the sensor was still transmitting. After read Mr.Whitaker's review, I changed the batteries in the receiver and suddenly all was well again.I gave this thing three stars because it's failure prone due to weak batteries but without the usual symptoms. I started having problems within the first few months of ownership. The batteries were probably weak from the factory."
2,Great for a while,"Oregon Scientific's indooe/outdoor thermometer with atomic clock is a useful household device. The receiver works fine. The outdoor transmitter which came with it also worked fine but for just over a week. Then it went comatose. New batteries made no difference. Even brought in from its carefully protected outdoor station and placed alongside the receiver, it failed to do anything. An older one is still working and a medium older one is not. Fool that I am---and because we have 3 receivers---I am ordering 2 new transmitters so we can (we hope) then read from 3 sites. I found no effective way to contact Oregon Scientific to complain. Another branf we had worked less well and we gace up on it."
3,Troubleshooting and Compatability,"Thank you R. Whitaker for your review ... it saved me from throwing away a perfectly good sensor and buying another one! Note: If the sensor batteries die, you may need to pop the batteries on the base unit to get it to reset and find the sensor again (replacing the base unit batteries may not be necessary).[...]"
1,Don't expect compatability!,"I purchased one of these as a second unit to go with a recently purchased weather station set of one Oregon Scientific BAR806HGA with a THN132N sensor. Although the two THN132N sensors are indistiguishable, the one from Amazon could not send humidity information to the BAR806HGA weather station. I contacted Amazon which immediately sent a replacement unit at no cost. This second unit had the identical problem. I tried to get support from Oregon Scientific by e-mail but it took forever and it was obvious from their response that had not read my question. Finally they told me that my unit, which I had purchased in April and which is advertised as a NEW, Top Seller on the Oregon Scientific website, is no longer in production and suggested that I buy a new unit from them. Fat chance. If I have to buy another unit I'll go back to La Crosse Technology. Amazon was great about the returns but I will avoid Oregon Scientific in the future."
2,Died quickly,"Had one, died after a month. Bought this replacement, died after 2 weeks. When it worked, it worked great. Just didn't work for long."
2,Oregon Temperature Sensor,The sensor itself went bad after 3 months of use. When it works it is great.
1,Oregon Scientific Wireless Temperature Sensor,I am unable to have this sensor be acknowledged by my receiver . I talked to a customer service representative at Oregon Scientific and was quite surprised to be unable to get support . The representative got rather brisk and unwilling to accept my problem. She actually hung up on me without providing any resolution . Very poor customer service .
4,As promised but sloq,The sensors were as promised but it took several weeks to get them and I had no way of tracking thier whereabouts during this time.
1,junk,3 legs already broken and it won't use big propane tanks.Its over designed and poorly constructed.
3,"The lamp works, but you may be able to find better prices.","My local Auto Zone didn't stock this lamp, which I needed for the dash board of my 1995 Chevy truck. Luckily, Amazon was there to bail me out of obscure part hell, as usual. The main problem with this lamp is that it's so cheap, the only way to justify the shipping is to order a bunch of them, and save them for the next burn out.If your local auto store sells this size lamp, buy it there. Otherwise, suck it up and pay $7 to ship a $2 bulb, buy a bunch, or live forever in dashboard darkness."
4,A Must-Have for the World We Live In,"This CD is a God-send. The guided imagery is able to relax me even after the most stressful of days. I have never listened to this type of recording before, but Alicia's voice is able to put the listener at ease. The accompanying music is perfectly suited to the content of the imagery, understandable since all but one song are original compositions written just for this recording. The sounds of the hammer dulcimer elicit a very relaxing feeling and the addition of the recorder is lovely. This is especially appropriate for those with health problems, but also perfect if you just need to relax or meditate. My favorite song is titled ""Gift From Above,"" although they are all beautiful. Enjoy!"
5,"very good hammer,","this is a must hammer for the hard working man. it takes only 2 hits to pound a 16 penny sinker. good balance, good overall."
1,missleading image,"This item has missleading image description, the product code it's the same but it's away different from the image, the backside of the hammer is much wider also the front too and black, it looks like it's completely different model but the thing is that the image on the webstore is fault. thank you ... Good as a hammer Stanley always are top products but it's not what I order"
4,I'm not very happy.,"This book is excellent. I bought it hard copy at full price and enjoyed it. I lent it to someone who never returned it, so I thought I would get a copy for my Kindle.I was annoyed that I could get it for 1 cent used on Amazon, new hard cover from Amazon for under $3.00, but the Kindle version is almost $13.00.Something is out of wack.Again, great book, lousy pricing plan."
4,Very well written history,"A well blanched, well researched work on the history of the Ross Sea party. The best I've read so far on this polar party."
3,Detailed Account,"Just finished the book and am a bit disappointed. I had hoped to get insight into the lives of the people involved in this amazing tale. What the author gives us is a detailed account of the events built from the diaries of the men. Overall the book reads like a newspaper article - the stories are sometimes intriguing but often tedious. If you are looking for a thorough account of the events that occurred around the Ross Sea Party, this is the book for you."
4,Inspiring tale of adventure and discovery,"This book is quite a gripping story both in based in tragedy and triumph.I saw the PBS special on the Shackleton Journey, but many times, like this, the book is much better.The book was highly researched and vividly written describing the many astonishing moments of the expedition.It was a ten-man journey the relies heavily on personal journals about some happy moments and some very terrible times. It goes into detail about the decreasing health of the journeymen and stuggles with scurvey, frostbite, snow blindness and the horrible mental and emotional anguish that many sucumb to on this dangerous 1330-mile mission to Antarctica."
3,It's ok.,"I loved almost every single song on their first album. When the 2nd one came out, I liked maybe a couple and couldn't stand the others. With this new album, the ballads are ok...nothing special really. I think what most of their fans want is another ""Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy"" type song, mixing country with an upbeat tempo and I think we get that with ""Loud"". If they had a few more song similar to Loud, and mix it up with their ballads, I think they may have had another hit album. I like this album better than 2nd. But I still play their 1st album in the car and sing along with it."
2,IF I WAS YOUR TEACHER-I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE YOU BOYS A C FOR THIS RECORDING,"I am a fan of Big & Rich-and I think they are capable of much better stuff than this-what a let down for me. The whole recording is leaving me feeling flat-no excitement or joy at all in this effort. I think you guys are now stuck-and need a record producer like Daniel Lanois to get you out of your misery. You know you need to make alot of effort, blood, sweat & tears to make a great record-SORRY BOYS YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY-SHAME ON YOU!!!!"
2,Yuck!,"Who are they and what have they done with Big & Rich? Boring ballads, kitchy krap, forced myself to listen more than once because after all I paid good money for the CD. And now that that duty is over, it's going in the Donate pile. Highly NOT recommended if Horse of a Different Color is more to your liking."
3,Not their best work,I didn't really like this CD. But I liked it better than the last one they put out. I think they've moved away from their initial sound too much that was in their 1st CD. These songs just aren't as powerful or moving.
4,It's okay.....,"This is way better than the last CD, but not as good as the first one. Definitely shouldn't be your first Big & Rich purchase, but definitely worth it if you're a fan."
5,Big and Rich,"Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace...perfect title for this CD. Lost in this Moment - if I was getting married again, would be my song...it is perfect for a wedding and if you are so much in love! Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace is yet another great song...very catchy tunes and glad I made the purchase. The best cd by far that Big and Rich has produced."
2,Really disappointed,"I have to say, as long as Big and Rich took to release this album I expected alot more. This cd is almost all ballads, and even the couple of up-tempo numbers are really lack-luster. I bought this as soon as it came out hoping for some fun country rockers, but this is not that album. Good luck, and buy this only if you like alot of ballads!"
4,Big and Rich,Not the typical Big and Rich album. Has some slower songs and they mix up their style some. Still has some traditional Big and Rich songs like Radio and loud. Still a good album but not their best.
2,Big Disappointment,"I was excited for the release of the latest CD from John & Kenny, even with the toned down and boring lead off single ""Lost In This Moment"" played on the radio.This is Big & Rich, they can't let me down.Well they did.They present this CD as if it was an old vinyl LP album, with ""side one"" loaded with strange and short intros into rather forgetable slow tunes.It's only till you get to ""Side B"" that they duo tries to redeem itself with a more familiar style and a few rockin' uptempo tracks like 'Radio', 'Loud', and a remake of the AC/DC classic 'You Shook Me All Night Long'.If I could buy just one ""side"" of this latest effort, I would pay half the price and go for side two.It's this sellout to commercialism that also ruined another favorite band of mine, Lonestar, who bore me now with every song and CD they release.Hmmm... John Rich used to be in Lonestar. Things that make you go hmmmm."
3,my opinion,it is one of my favorite obscure movies. I even had the vhs converted into a dvd as well as have the soundtrack. Im also looking for the novel.
3,For Cistaro,"I watched this movie to see Anthony Cistaro (as the cop pointing out the large amount of blood on the stairs) in an earlier role than Kenneth Irons (from Witchblade). Still, mythology stories are never ALL bad."
5,quite good,"This is one of my favorite dictionaries of foreign phrases: I flip through it often.There are five languages covered: French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, and German. The phrases come from literature, mythology, history, and politics, but not popular culture.In terms of diacritical marks, the dictionary is well done, with all the accents in French, Spanish, German, and Italian having been meticulously seen to. Pronunciation might be a problem for you, though, since there is no guide to pronunciation, and nothing else to help you (e.g., the Latin lacks macrons, and the Italian section contains no assistance for irregularly stressed words) on any section.Author and source of each quote are also given, where known.Each page has two columns: the left is the foreign language, and the right is the English translation. Each section also contains an index of key words. Then there is an English index at the end."
5,Quotations in its original language,"""Traduttore tradittore "" say the italians. Here you have the quotation in the original language and the english translation you can disagree with. The ""music"" or prosodia of the original language contributes to the quotation's strength. Highly recommendable for academics."
5,The Sun'll come out...,"Once, before the coming of the light...before the keeper of the prescription pad cast the clouds from my eyes and brought me from the darkness, I had no Mr. Wrinkles. Clutching my goat sack of dried beef, I'd ask of the other shadows ""Where is my Mr. Wrinkles?"", though it meant something very different at the time. They didn't speak in the cave.Then the Sacred White-Robed Attendants came, and dressed me in my ceremonial five-point restraints. He who walks behind the prescription pad, wielding his mighty 16 gauge golden needle of enlightenment, approached me and mightily smote me. Now I see humor in everything.I like to to sit in my room and look out at the gardens. I look out at Mr. Wrinkles. I scream, laughing.HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa. He likes me. He tells me that I can join them someday...in the garden. He tells me how to pick locks and bypass security. I'm a secret agent for the frog prince."
4,The Real Deal in USA fishing,"This is the real deal for commercial fishing, easily the most popular brand in the USA. Despite being a Swedish company, not so popular in Europe, where other brands are more popular. But, still, well-made, very tough. Only area where these could be better is in colors and reflective strips for safety. Hi-viz orange color and reflective tabs would make the safer in MOB situation. ALSO, paying the small extra price for the Brigg 44 model, which has the neoprene cuffs is easily worth it for me."
5,BEST WIDEANGLE LENS I HAVE USED,"This lens is awesome.I wanted a wideangle for shooting indoor low light. This filled that void and then some. I wasnt satisfied with the idea of getting a f/2.8 wideangle lens for shooting indoors. I wanted something faster, then I stumbled up on this lens. I could not find many reviews, but I figured Sigma was a good brand, and anyways the lens turned out to be fantastic.I use it primary for indoor shooting and for situations where I need a wider angle of view.I would highly recommend this lens to anyone who just needs something wider than a 50mm on a DX sensor.I am using this on a Nikon D90 and have been overwhelmingly satisfied with this product."
5,Great Lens!,"I used this lens on a Sony Alpha 350, it does exactly what I want it to do, and it's lightweight. Great Lens!"
2,Wouldn't buy it again.,"I had used this lens maybe 3 times. Then it decided it no longer felt like auto focusing.So I sent it to Sigma for repair. Two months later I finally got it back.When it gets it right, the focus is beautiful. But it also loves to back focus.Good Luck."
5,SIGMA LENS REVIEW,THE SIGMA 28mm f/1.8 EX DG ASPHERICAL MACRO LARGE APERTURE WIDE ANGLE LENS FOR CANON SLR CAMERAS IS GREAT. THE OPTICS ARE FAST--IT TAKES AMAZING LOW-LIGHT LEVEL PHOTOS. I'VE USED IT TO TAKE DETAILED PHOTOS FROM ABOUT FOUR INCHES TO INFINITY. ITS WIDE ANGLE CAPABILITY WORKS FOR PORTRAITS OF LARGE FAMILIES WITHOUT DISTORTING THE SCENE. IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR SHOOTING ACTION SCENES OF MY SONS' GRADE SCHOOL BASKETBALL GAMES. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T BUY ONE SOONER. THE PRICE I PAID WAS VERY REASONABLE. THE LENS WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION WHEN RECEIVED.
3,Verdict is still out,"I am a medium to high end user of photographic equipment. I purchased this lens for the ""speed"" of the lens and its ability to function in low light. The lens does work well in low light but I have not been overly pleased with the focus of the images. The lens is a little heavy as well. I like using this as my walk-around lens when taking street scenes. The focusing may be user error but I have read some reviews regarding the re-calibrating of this model by the manufacturer."
5,I was surprised!,"Maybe my copy is different,i don't know for sure.But wide open,this thing is a real beast,it's TACK sharp,and stopping it down is really another story.If u considering a wdie angle prime lens,u gotta give this one a shot.Fast primes with wide range like this one,is a very new perspectiv,and the out of focus area is very large.Using it on a nikon D3"
3,"not to send overseas is ridiculous in these modern, global-world times!","It's was a major inconvenience, time and cost expenditure to get my order sent to me. Why? because the seller doesn't send outside of the US. Hello? I thought we lived in a world of international global trade and comunication. Let's get with it! Or stay in the stone age and you can bet I won't order again."
3,old and dirty,"i don't mean to crack on my man o.d.b., but this album was flat out stale. i loved o.d.b. from the moment i heard him on wu's ""protect ya neck."" he was ILL, and right then and there i said to myself i have to buy his solos. guess what, this one does not reflect the full potential of the [dirty man]. this album is too bizarre to be loved, or maybe it's just me. if you're into like extremely weird stuff that might not even make sense, pick it up. it's not a bad album actually, it just doesn't make any sense. o.d.b. does keep you entertained with his crazy voice which is what i love about this man. his voice is INSANE. his tone is PSYCHOTIC. a lot to love on this album, but the negatives of it crowd out the good...(shout out to my boy Javid...heh heh i said crowd out). it also feels incomplete and rushed like he needed crack money or something. but anyways, this album is ok. pick it up if you must, but i suggest getting ""return to 36 chambers: the dirty version."""
5,ODB Nigga PLease,"All of the songs rulzzzz, expect for ""Good Morning Heartache"". Get this dirty bastard's cd!!!!!"
3,Comedy at its best.,"Positives: From a comical point of view this is a great album. ""Good Morning Heartache"" is a track I suppose we'd all love to do. ODB can't sing at all and the fact that he tries is hilarious. I guess if I had my own album, I'd do the same thing. There are a few tracks where ODB raps some nice lines when he's not singing and messing around. The record is also original. You have to give him that much.Negatives: This CD doesn't exactly showcase ODB's skills as well as it could. He had to have had fun with these tracks but I can't compare them to anything Meth is putting out. I don't think he was taking things all that seriously for some of these tracks."
4,RIP Big Baby Jesus!,"Personally, I like 'Ni**a Please' more than his debut 'Return', because his rapping is more off the wall than ever, especially on ""I Can't Wait"" and ""Rollin Wit You"". ""Got Your Money"" was the radio hit single on this album, which is still kinda fresh sounding. Other treats are his attempts at singing Rick James ""Cold Blooded"" and Billie Holliday's ""Good Morning Heartache"". ODB is usually hard to keep up with on this album, but his lyrics make 'Ni**a Please' all the more entertaining.RIP Big Baby Jesus! You'll be missed!!!"
2,Awful Album,"O.D.B., Ason, Big Baby Jesus, whatever you call him, you can call this a waste of time. I have read plenty of magazine reviews that hail this as a ""ground-breaking"" album. I think O.D.B. is playing a joke on listeners--the album title supports this and he says it in so many words on the album. ""Baby I got Your Money"" is a phenomenal song, its funky, and it's a real dead on parody of the Hip Hop climate, as relevant today as it was when it came out. The rest of these songs are just dumb and the production is nothing to get excited about either."
3,Could have been better,"You know there's nothing wrong with black insperation, but it coming from ol' dirt Migurt is quite sad. Saying white people will never take over, and they did take over, shows dirt is still playing in dirt. Here's a guy with 14 kids from different women and stealing sneakers from from a factory outlet talking about black insperation. Come on Son."
2,Wack,This album is so wack I rarely play it. Dirt's first album was far better. This is actually a waste of money.
5,Simply great!,It's just so damn good! Simply the greatest album any Wu-member ever realised! Thank U ODB!
3,Huh? What Happened?,"The problem with this album is 1) the Rza didn't do production. 2) No Wu-Clans Men on any tracks. Now ODB's lyrics are, as usual, hot and funny. But thats the only thing going on this joint. But its still worth picking up, if your an ODB fan."
4,Middle-Aged Femme givin' props - God Bless you ODB,"We'll miss you, Ol' Dirty, even those of us like myself with a love/hate relationship with rap/hip-hop. You can't deny the creativity that he put into his music. I'll keep this brief, but my positive thoughts and prayers go out to his family."
3,Average album at best,"ODB is probably one the strangest rappers I've ever heard. I have to say though that he can tear it up when he's in his element. ""Return to the 36 Chambers"" was an amazing and innovative approach to rap music and was fun to listen to.Having said that, this one has a few high points but a lot of what ODB was trying to do didn't formulate. I love the last song, ""Got Your Money"", and a couple others but this doesn't measure up to the standard he set for himself or for other Wu-Tang releases. Just being honest.I would never speak ill of the dead and I hope ODB has found peace. RIP"
2,Horrible,"I can't listen to this all the way through. Infact, half of the songs are pretty unlistenable. Even the best songs are a bit horrible to listen to. ODB added an interesting dimension to the WuTang Clan, but as a solo artist, was just too much. RIP."
3,nigga please,THIS IS ODB AS WE KNOW HIS LYRICS ARE FUNNY AS EVER BUT MUSICALLY THE CONTENT WAS TERRIBLE WITHOUT THE RZA PRODUCTION AND ADDITIONAL WU ELEMENTS THIS ABLUM WONT GO FAR BUT IF YOU IS ODB FAN LIKE MYSELF BABY I GOT YOUR MONEY IS THE TICKET.
2,Don't kid yourself...,"...this is a bad album. You can't pretend it's not.I really really don't know what Wu-Tang/ODB/Elektra Records was thinking when they released ""Nigga Please,"" but... ... at least with Dirty's first album, you could enjoy the beats and try to tune out the yelling, screaming, etc. AND on the first CD, there was actually a little bit of RHYMING here and there. Remember RHYMING, Ol' Dirty? Apparently not.This CD is nothing but a collection of alright beats (and often not even that), underneath Russell Jones screaming and yelling and ranting and raving. It just doesn't hold anyone's attention anymore.But I can't call it a total waste. ""Recognize"" has a sweet beat courtesy of the Neptunes (who do a lot work on the album, most of it poor), ""Cold Blooded"" is mildly enjoyable, and there are a few clever lines in ""Got Your Money."" Also, the title track is very tolerable, one of RZA's better new tracks. But on the whole, this album is not worth your money."
2,Just Thrown together to make money!,"I was hyped for this album before its release. When I listened to it though I was very disapointed. I was in with the WU from the beginning when RZA was cutting the beats. O.D.B's first disc, Return to the 36 Chambers was unbelieveable and I gave it 5 stars and it might be the in the top 3 WU discs. He changed his styles 5 or 6 times on the CD and blew my mind with some sweet rhymes. This CD sounded like he ran out of the welfare checks he was collecting on MTV and he needed some quick cash. I suggest you stay away from this one. Peace out and big up to a Masta Killa solo albumn. Wheres it at?"
2,Get Serious.....,"What few listeners realize is that behind all the clowning and moonshining, ODB is a lyrical master. However, someone has led him to beleive that throwing together some 'nuhs', yells, and bad singing is a way follow up a great debeut album. Outside of ""Baby I Got.."" this CD was a waste of my time. When I buy a hip hop CD, I want to hear lyrics not comedy skits. Theres a difference between Biggie singing ""Playa Hata"" on one track and OLB putting out this mess. As a member of group that prides themselves on lyrical skills, ODB should know better. I hate to see a waste of talent."
5,It's good music and creative lyrics,O.D.B is back in is better than ever. This album is ten times better than the first one.
2,Not The Best,"I bought this CD, and about an hour later, I wanted to return it! He sounds like he was drunk when he was recording it! I would buy this CD only if you like that music."
3,The second coming of ODB!,"Although this album is not as strong as his first solo effort, ODB continues his ways, by remaining original and in your face. Most people will see this album as an oppertunity to pick up a copy of the lead single, ""Got Your Money"", but there is a lot more to it then that. As a long time Wu follower I was a bit disappointed, yet I would never part with the album as it does still have it's intrinsic WU based values. There is a lot to be learned from ODB and his clansmen... ...so listen close. On a final note, this is the first Wu affiliate album in the past little while, where the RZA's absence isn't painfully obvious. Although, I'm sure it would have been better with the Zig-Zag master producing all the tracks, this album has fared much better then some of the others, ie. Meth's and Deck's..."
4,"Not as good as the first album, but still nuff respect !!!","This album is not as good as the first album and the style is very different, so I can dig it if people don't ""understand"" this album. But for a true ODB fan, it's a very understandable and dope ass style/album, so if ya ask me... !!! DA BOMB BABY...NUFF RESPECT !!!"
3,not what i expected from ODB,I used to love the Wu but they haven't come out with anything great since Wutang forever. The GZA was pretty good and meth had a few good tracks but this albem sounds like it took 2 weeks to make. It's got some banging beats but the lyrics are horrible. Not even close to his first album.
4,OL' DIRTY IS BACK,"Altough the RZA only produced a couple of the tracks, the beats on here are pretty nice. The beats are mostly handled by neptunes, who produced noreaga's ""oh no"" and ""superthug,"" and Irv Gotti. Ol' Dirty's lyrics are as nasty as ever and he's damn funny. Fans of Ol' Dirty will bump this album"
3,aight,odb mmakes a bizarre performance on this album. got yourmoney is the best track by far. this track got the cd 5out of 5 stars but some of odb's bizarre rhymes bring it down. odb was probably smokin while makin this album so it sounds good for how high he probly was. i think he should be allowed outta prison. he couldn't have commited all of those crimes. anyway the cd is funny but odb is not a lyrical genius. peace out
5,"Is Rick James Back ? Yo,This CD is the S**T !","What can you say, DIRTY will be DIRTY. The cd is an original, a must have. DIRTY does it all. I'm looking forward to a DIRTY and RICK collabo. The cover alone gets 5 stars. THE ARMY LOVES DIRTY !"
1,WHat A Joke,way Too Many people get Deals today.this is a Bad Joke.&HOW DARE HE DO A REMAKE OF RICK JAMES'S COLD BLOODED? RICK James Is THE MAN.Only GOt Your Money is Worth Listening to.it Only makes sense at How Overrated he is cuz The Whole Wu Tang Clan are Overrated as well.Avoid at all Costs.
1,Nigga Please,"Nigga please is one of the worst WU-affiliated releases ever,it sounds as weak as any other formulaic popchart hiphop release.""Oh but it's so funny"", yeah whatever, if you look past his senseless looning and raving (how funny is that after 9 songs), you're left with a very mediocre release suitable only for people who haven't a clue what proper hiphop is all about."
1,AVOID!,"It's so funny. Black people hate being called anything like the title by white people, yet they call each other the very same. This is nothing but racist noise. If you are black, stay away because it puts your proud heritage into the trash. If you are white, stay away because of the hate in the air."
4,The Best I've Ever Used,"I have been using this for a few years and I'm very satisfied with the product.I only use it for facial hair,but it works extremely well,better than any other home waxing I've tried.This wax is very easy to use.Heat it in the microwave cut the strips to fit the area and that's it, hair's gone.I have tried another very popular wax that has been around forever (zip)and while it does a great job of removing hair.It is very difficult to use.Given my choice I will stick to this one.This is becoming more difficult to find, very happy to find it here on Amazon."
3,"Full of heart, but full of clichés as well","Writing an entire novel in Southern dialect--any dialect, for that matter--is difficult work. Props to the author for keeping up the energy in that regard. However, clichés abound within the lines as well as the story line, which was disappointing. We get alcoholism, abuse, murder, the poor South, a dash of religion and race, etc. All the things you'd expect. That said, the narrator has heart and you will grow to care about her."
4,Very Great,I love this book it is an amazing read its so truthful and forgiving and perfect for someone who just wants to sit down on your couch and enjoy a nice read.I have to admit this book is so good that once i start i find it hard to stop until i realize that my eyes are starting to get tired and it seems like the story is taking a whole different turn it goes from one story to another.....but you know maybe thats just me
2,Roseflower Creek,I enjoyed this book. but by no means found it a 4 or 5 star. I had no trouble putting it down. I was disappointed in the ending too.
2,Wish I hadn't read it,"Reminded me of an adult, macabre version of Junie B. Jones. Though the author tries to write with the lightness and humor of a child, which I usually love, many parts of this story made me sick to my stomach. I would have stopped reading had I realized the disturbing scenes go clear to the end of the story and in fact increase.I found no redeeming value in the father, although the author tries to develop some compassion for him at several points.Clearly, I am in the minority, based on the other reviews I see here! Just thought I'd pass along my 2 cents worth in case you're considering this book based on the reviews, like I did. If you enjoy stories about children with unfortunate and/or unusual childhoods told from their perspective, here are a few I thought were great:Too Close to the FallsPeace Like a RiverThe Glass CastleBlackbird"
3,Engaging but depressing,"I'll admit that this book hooked me from the first sentence. A sentence, as it turns out, that the author borrowed from a real life event. It's too sad to think about that these kind of things happen in real life.As engaging as it was, I only gave it three stars because the whole story left me with a sick feeling. Too much bad and not enough good. I was also very annoyed at the way the abuser's actions were excused by his violent past. I don't think this was intentional. I believe the author was trying to make points about the value of forgiveness and the effects of child abuse on future generations. Even so, I found myself angry at the justifications. I also thought it was too unbelievable that a 10 year old could grasp these difficult concepts."
1,Unrelenting manipulation,"While well written, this story is unrelenting in its depictions of the brutality of an abuser toward his family. The author attempts to explain and excuse the abuser's behavior through the voice of his murder victim. It fails. I did not connect with the characters, and I felt manipulated. Not recommended."
1,Contrived and Over done,"After reading the reviews, I bought this book expecting an inspiring story. It is not. This story takes the rural, poverty-stricken south and uses every stereotype and cliched dramatic effect in what is predictable and sad. There are great novels of the people and children who survived poverty-stricken upbringings in the rural south. I wish this novel was one of those."
2,NOT worth 1 red cent!,"Only if you are a Christian reader, willing to tolerate poor plotting and worse characterization, should you bother with this.Obviously it's appeal is in its religious orientation.If you are looking for a book to read with no strings, no religion being pushed, look further."
1,Not well written,"I really wanted to like this book, but didn't. I kept reading, though, hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Really was a waste of almost eight dollars."
5,Sweet Sadness,"I am an avid reader of many different types of books. This one will stay with me for a very long time. It is without a doubt one of the best reads I've ever experienced. Little LoriJean became a child I wanted to love and protect--just be able to tell her that everything would be ok. However, she was the one who taught me the lesson. Forgiveness and unconditional love. It was the saddest, sweetest book I can ever remember and I only wish I had not read it yet so I could enjoy it for the first time again!"
5,What a book!!,"Not since Scout in To Kill A Mockingbird have I been so taken with a character. Lori Jean's perspective on life in l950's rural Georgia is as delightful as it is sad. She climbs into your heart and stays in your head. A mesmerizing tale of family dysfunction and where it can lead. I wager you will read this book in one sitting and I bet I win. This book was released a year before The Lovely Bones (which I also enjoyed, though it's a darker tale) Sorry I didn't spot Roseflower Creek sooner. It deserves to be ""out there""."
5,Very good!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. While it was somewhat depressing I also found it inspirational. Lori Jean, the main character, was so positive even when she was faced with some very difficult situations. I also enjoyed that the book was written from Lori Jean's perspective, she was only 10 and I think her innocence really showed through."
4,Roseflower Creek and Cold Rock River,"I very much enjoyed reading Roseflower Creek and have also read another book, Cold Rock River, by this author. Both were easy reads and kept my interest. Also, they were an enlightening read about the south and slavery. Really portrays the human emotional aspects of peoples lives. The author has a very interesting way of telling a story."
1,I just could not finish the book,"I wanted to like this book. It is written from the voice of a 10 year old who is dead. I just could not get into the book. I understand that the characters live in the south, they are poor and probably not educated. I just do not enjoying reading books that have poor grammar and English. I comprehend it is their voice it is just not the voice for me. Aside from not enjoying the voice, I found the flow of the book to be unbelievably slow."
3,Chock full of social redeeming whacha callit,"Do you enjoy reading about white trash goings on? Do you like to read about little boys being molested? Do you like to read about little girls being beaten to death? Then, this is the book for you! Hey, read the Dave Pelzer books if you want even more cruelty to children. And, if you like Hitler, you will really enjoy Stalin. Told by the deceased distaff Huckleberry Finn, sort of. ""Roseflower Creek"" may be chock full of social redeeming whacha callit, but it is no fun at all."
5,"A book so good, they printed it twice.","The first time I read Roseflower Creek, I thought the author must be a shy little girl, college aged maybe- the way the voice of the young protagonist, ten year old Lori Jean called to me so clearly.Miles certainly has a handle on her characters. I loved who I loved and I hated who I hated. I read this book in one sitting, pausing only to re-read poetic passages, allowing myself to slip into a world I hoped never to be near, one of hurt and pain and struggle. WIth the unique approach of opening a novel with the words of a dead girl, Miles had me hooked from the first page.Since the hardcover came out, I have read all of Jackie Miles' other books and plan to tuck this RC paperback in my purse for an upcoming escape, because when someone puts words like this on paper, they are meant to be read.Meant to be enjoyed over and over again."
4,a redeeming & endearing read!,"ROSEFLOWER CREEK could have been sappy & sentimental, instead this author's debut novel is an absorbing, fascinating glimpse of how a child looks at adults' behavior & the dangerous relationships we foster.Until Lori Jean's grandmother dies, she had kept Lori Jean's universe safe. When her auntie & uncle move to their own home, Lori Jean's mother's new husband begins to make their lives ugly. So ugly that eventually, in a drunken rage, he does the unthinkable.Why Lori Jean's mother lands in jail for murder makes for a satisfying read.ROSEFLOWER CREEK could have been a dreadful read about another family destroyed by bad choices & domestic violence. It is, however, not so dreadful because J. L. Miles has crafted a fine mystery, told in the voice of a victim who is like no victim we've met before.Well done!"
5,Foibles at the fireside,"You'd need to be a history buff to come to this book ""cold"" - but I searched for it after seeing a Royal Shakespeare Company production of the piece and regard it as a treasure. It evokes memories of truly flawless theatre which brought the writings to life, and it's in that context that this piece is written.The glimpses of centuries of royal life in England are drawn from a range of contemporary sources. In the beautiful edition I have, these are illustrated with contemporary carvings, etchings, drawings and paintings, subtle and restrained. I'm anticipating with great pleasure many a fireside evening dipping into the book."
4,get it for the First Essay for Orchestra,listen to the above sample and think about your eventual demise.
3,Feel good book,I found it difficult to tie the questions to the content of the scripture. I would have liked more meaty questions.
5,Deliciously Funny,"I bought the VHS tapes of this series after they became available. Now that I have worn them out, I am going to purchase the DVD's of this series. I entitled this review as ""Deliciously Funny"" as you savor every moment of this series rather than just watch it. It's brilliantly funny and is my favorite British comedy series of all time. The way Lucia pronounces ""Lobster à la Riseholme"" is just plain funny in itself."
5,"Not Much To See, You Say?","The novels occupy such a hallowed place in the hearts of those who are devoted to Miss Mapp and Mrs Lucas that the non-initiated might look at these episodes and scarcely believe their eyes. Arch, ridiculous characters prancing and preening across their screens, portrayed by respected and beloved British acting icons. You might need to read the E F Benson novels (six in all) on which these discs are based. Well, actually they're only based on three of the six; sadly, the Riseholme population is left out of these tales. The costumes are amazing as is the camera work. The performances perfectly capture the sublime nonchalance of Benson's characters. Stupendous on all counts."
5,Jovial period piece reflecting stylish wit!,"Wonderfully written wit, delightful repartee,period details to perfection! The ""characters"" are quirky and carefully crafted, executed with a fine touch -refreshingly human in all their foibles and folly. The quest to be a big fish - in a village pond! Entertainment that is good fun and leaves you smiling. Enjoy this series for a ""time-out"" from todays grim, heavy-handed, dark, lackluster fare. Hang on to your toupee, take out the Rolls and head into town for the current round of gossip and adventure! This is a series you can watch again and again, savoring details you may have missed. Enjoy!"
1,Ring Rockin' Crud,"This was almost as bad as the 1995 event. The US title match between Konnan & Eddie Guerrero was a good solid match but still not enough to save this PPV. The Steven Regal-Fit Finlay match was a great brawl which was ruined by a DQ ending. The Man vs Woman match between Madusa & Col.Robert Parker was crud to the 10th power. the Bootyman(subbing for Johnny B Badd who left to join the WWF)-DDP match was second-rate at best. The Giant-Loch Ness match was pointless and a big letdown. The Chicago Street Fight between the team of Sting & Booker T against The Road Warriors was a third rate ECW ripoff and a bad reminder of the Harlem Heat-Nasty Boys match from the 1995 event. The Tower Of Doom Steel Cage match was nothing more then as The Nostalgia Critic would call it a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". I give this ""PPV"" a 1 out of 10."
3,WCW UnCensored 1996 (review #1),"I am Michael, and I have come to give you fair wrestling tape reviews, that should be the best you read on Amazon.com. This is my first of what will be many reviews, so here we go. The second match is between Fit Finley and Steven Regal. Surprisingly, it doesn't stink! It is a pretty damn good hardcore match from the usually softer WCW. Next thing of note is the streetfight which set a world record for low blows,that stood for 15 minutes. Kevin Sullivan broke the record in the Doomsday match, which is a very unique concept and is quite excititng, but pales in comparison to Tony's commentary. ""Luger is obviously a fresh man...he hasn't been hit with a frying pan!"" The late Jeep Swenson(Bane from ""Batman & Robin"") is the Ultimate Soloution, if you must know . . ."

3,Kovu beany baby,"I was a little surprised when Kovo came shipped with a price tag of $6.00 on him, however, I was charged $30"
2,Don't Read This Book Unless If You're Going For PhD,"This book is the source of a distinct paradigm in management research. The author raised many issues related to the assumptions that had been used as a basis for positivism, and suggests new approach of what he called realist science.I can bet that 99% of normal people will find this book a mental torture, very few will ever proceed beyond page 2 of this book. If you imagine a long bearded person with long hair, sitting in a room full of books and muttering to himself of something totally incomprehensible while jotting something in a book, THIS is exactly the kind of book that you are going to read. In short, stay away unless if you have a commitment to enhance your knowledge in the philosophy of social science, which is not typical unless if you're enrolled in the first year PhD in Management. Good luck!"
2,Cover Missing,I was very disappointed to not get a front cover nor an insert booklet for this CD. It was a present for my brother.
2,Vaughn Willams: Fantasies; Lark Ascending,"Have heard and have purchased better recordings of this beautiful music. The recording volume on this albun is inconsistently mixed, too soft in some passages and too loud in others for my ear."
3,adequate but disappointing from Marriner,"This CD was a disappointment for me in that Marriner's conducting of these Vaughan Williams works falls somewhat short of his interpretations of other composers on other recordings. Tempos tend to be awkward and with the Tallis fantasia, rushed. Poor choice of tempo muddles Vaughan Williams' lyrical and lush, yet unconventional melodic sense, which is actually the work of genuis. Yet this recording too frequently makes that genius sound arbitrary and a bit incoherent. Marriner could have done better, especially with an English composer. The orchestra performance is the quality that one expects of Saint Martin of the Fields. It is between their performance and the genius of Vaughan Williams that earn this CD any noteworthy remarks in my opinion."
1,Shame on you Apple!,"Well, all I can say is that my experience with Apple and their Macbook Pro (MBP) has been a total disaster! I ordered my MBP on May 30th, and since then I've had three(!) replacements due to terrible build quality. The first MBP went back because the case was buckled above the battery, the lid didn't close properly, and it kicked out huge amounts of heat. The second MBP went back because the screen catch was broken on delivery. My third, and final MBP is about to go back because the LCD has extremely uneven illumination and the lid doesn't close properly (one side closes flush to the keyboard, whilst the opposite side has a gap of almost 0.5cm). My advice to anyone considering a MBP is to wait until they have ironed out their quality control issues. I was a Mac convert, but I might just convert back :-("
4,Grade B+,"Overall I am happy with the MacBookPro. Lots of positives. Problems include 1)too hot to handle, uncomfortably hot when used as a laptop.2)Kept shutting down after a few minutes of battery use. I took it to the Apple store and a new battery seem to have solve the problem. 3)The lid/screen is slightly warped, this is more cosmetic.I bought this notebook in March 2006. I believe that I bought too early.I have an Imac which is awesome, and receives an A+."
1,HP changed the product - for the worse. Ignore all reviews more than 3 months old.,"I've been using HP's Glossy Inkjet Brochure Paper (C6817A) for several years, and up until my most recent order, it's been terrific. Good color rendition, fast drying time, great hand. Unfortunately, though they kept the name and the product ID number, they changed everything else about the product. It doesn't take ink well (everything looks pale and washed-out, even rich black), and the hand is horrible. It actually squeaks. Didn't care about drying time, since the pages went straight from the printer to the recycle bin, and the box went straight back to Amazon. The former version of the product was the only decent 2-sided glossy inkjet I'd ever found. Now there are none."
1,updated product is TERRIBLE,"I had also been using the old product for years to make flyers for my business. It was amazing paper. This new, updated version (also applies to the tri-fold paper) is terrible. The color is dull and washed-out. Plain paper looks tons better. Don't buy this product, complain to HP to get them to put the old paper back!"
1,Yellow Semi-Gloss Paper,This paper is 180gm and is yellow colored with brightness probably 60and is semi-gloss on both sides.This is not the quality of paper you will expectfrom a respectable company like HP !Buying this is a waste of money !
2,This Paper is junk do not buy!!,"One review commented read the dates on the reviews!! Anything before 2009 isn't the same product. HP, I guess decided to change the product...probably pinching some pennies?! Anyway this paper doesn't hold the color on any of our inkjet or laser printers. We have Brother, Epson, and Canon laser and inkjet printers and the prints on this paper look horrible. Vibrant just out of the printers but then fades so badly you couldn't and wouldn't present this to clients. The paper is truly a bad product. We print our own DVD slim case covers for clients and the product is simply unacceptable. We have bought so much of this stuff and can't use it. I know others are printing 2 sided glossy!!! What are they using and where do they get it????"
2,"Good Paper - A bit crinkled (from storage, or shpping?)","This paper is perfect for us - 2 sided HP inkjet. [austinstudios.com] I hope our next order doesn't have the crimp lines lines that the first had -- poor handling, or cheap shipping, I don't know. Uncreased, this is great paper. Hoping Pacific can improve final quality."
5,"Very nice paper, but...",I really like this paper. It has a nice gloss to it and it works great with my Canon printer. I just wish it wasn't such a heavy weight. Seems a bit thick for brochure paper. Not bad though and I am just being picky.
4,Too much like Illustrator for me.,"Adobe Photoshop 6.0 proves to be very useful and very flexible, however its overall effect of being very similar to Illustrator slightly disturbs me. I prefer to use 5.5, perhaps I just haven't shined to 6.0 yet... Oh well, still very useful."
4,uummmmm??,I thought that this was one of the greatest softwares I had Bought after Photoshop 5. THat was untill photoshop 7 came out. Personally I would skip the savings and go for the good stuff with Photoshop7. Almost the same as 6 except that there is a history function that allows you to go back as many steps as you need. There are an uncountable amount of new features that are so easy to use I was blown away.
3,If I were a rich man,"Yes this product is as brilliant as everyone says. I use it at work every day and would love to buy a copy for my home PC.But, come on Adobe!! You can buy a car for the same price as this."
4,Nice casual girl's sneaker..runs small,I bought a second pair of these for my daughter. She loves them and wears them almost daily. They run very small though. She normally wears 10.5 or 11..I bought the Caravan's in a 12 and they fit her.
1,much too much,"I purchased this dvd to show to my students who were studying Romeo and Juliet and who had read the novel, Romiette and Julio. I thought the inter-racial tensions would tie in nicely to the play and the novel. While the storyline does provide a good match, the overuse of profanity makes it impossible to use. I understand that it is important to portray characters realistically, but swearing for swearing sake does not enhance anything, and this is true for this film. What a disappointment...save your money and if you do want to see this...rent it instead!"
4,B is for Birthday puzzle review,"The puzzle was clever. It was a little harder than expected because there was no picture which showed what the final assembled puzzle should look like. The box was only a partial picture. Overall, however, a good birthday present."
2,"This Should've been labled ""B Is For Bust""","For those who aren't sure how to do these mystery puzzles: You read the enclosed book. Then you put together the puzzle or puzzles blind (no picture art). The answer to the mystery is enclosed in the puzzle or puzzles.However if you are looking for a good challenge, I DO NOT recommend this puzzle.This puzzle was a huge disappointment. I was really pleased that the first mystery puzzle (""A Is For Arson"") took me 3 weeks to put it together. THIS one on the other hand took me only 3 days to assemble; part of one of the puzzles did have the cover art in it.I also purchased with ""B Is For Birthday"", the following puzzles:""A Is For Arson"" (Excellent puzzle)""C Is For Chocolate"" (Started May 4, 2012 and have determined this will be like ""A Is For Arson"" but still in progress. ***See my review for ""A Is For Arson""***""D Is For Diamonds"""
4,Beautiful!!,"Better then i expected... it arrived 3-5 days after it was promised to artrive, however perfect and classic. the gold lined pages were gorgeous and the size is perfect.. not too big.. but not really small like the rest ive seen on here. I would buy it again, but would've bought the 2 day shipping to save my worris so close to my wedding. Great price."
5,Great Kit,"Unit was very easy to install, took longer to plan which circuits I wanted to power. As mentioned by other reviews, I did have to switch out some of single breakers for dual pole to get to the 10 circuits which also required some additional wire.Bought it in combo with the Generac GP 7000E. The manual transfer switch kit came with 25ft generator cord, plugs and everything I needed to connect to my load center. I can run 10 circuits and almost everything in my house except the AC. Ran it for about 8 hours with partial load on one tank of gas.Generac 5626 GP Series GP7000E 8750-Watt 410cc OHV Portable Gas Powered Generator with Electric Start (Non-CARB Compliant)GenTran 3028K 30 Amp 8-Circuit Transfer Switch/Power Inlet Box/Power Cord Kit For Up To 7,500-Watt Generators"
5,Good buy,"Good value, can interchange circuit breakers from local stores if they go bad or you want other sizes (unlike cheaper models and other brands), easy to install with minimal experience and good instructions."
5,GenTran 3028K Transfer Switch 30 amp review,The Kit was a very good value. I had an electrician hook it up. No surprises. It works! I recommed it .
5,South Texas Water Woes,Multiple water main breaks and living in a trailer has resulted in my having to use the Culligan heavy duty filter. With this filter I don't have to remove the faucet strainers. It does the job simply and easily. I even travel the U.S and Canada with the canister attached to my hoses.
4,Water Almost Tastes Good,"One of the few products I can't five star. Culligan, I'll give you credit for creating an OK product. I have some seriously foul water - all kinds of magnesium in it. That's what the water guy trying to sell me a 10K system said it was. I always thought it was iron - but whatever. Filter is straight ORANGE when I'm done with it. It only lasts like a month in my water but the price point works. My water is actually drinkable though. At least for me - not sure I want my son drinking it. But I'll reluctantly drink it. Bottom line is that this filter is way better than not using a filter at all."
4,Good filter,I am running this filter after a water softener on a well. This filter filters out just about all sediment and my water is just about clear. There is still a little tint to it but a lot better than any of the other filters I have tried including the activated carbon filter. The main test will be how long this filter lasts. If I can get three months I will be happy.
5,Does What It Claims!,"It does a great job! I live in the mountains, and there is a lot of sediment. I have been using this filter for nine years, and I am not disappointed."
5,One for those who like lots of lovely barefoot ladies!,"This is one for those who appreciate a barefoot lady. The contest scene at the climax of the film has about 40 remarkably attractive female bodybuilders on stage, all in bikinis and barefoot. I just wish I could get on stage and give all those lovely pairs of feet some attention! Please release this on dvd soon!"
3,It's a slipmat,"What else can you say, it's a slipmat. Break it in and it will provide years of service."
2,Sombra,"I was anxious to get this stuff, as I have fibromyalgia with chronic pain. It works good for about 5 minutes for me, then wears off to nothing. Not saying it's a bad product, just doesn't work for me :("
2,Doesn't work for me,"I have tried a number of these products and was anxious to give this a shot after reading the reviews. I'm sorry to say it just didn't do much for me, other than a subtle warmth that went away in a short time and the pain pretty much remained.I found the BIOFREEZE pain relieving roll on much more effective, as well as more convenient."
1,This caused me incredible pain,"I am a chronic pain sufferer so I decided to try Sombra Warm Therapy gel after it being recommended to me. I wish I'd never tried it. I put it on exactly as the directions say and it really burned. Even though I gently tried to wipe it off, it didn't make the burning go away any sooner. The stuff lasts what seems like forever, it didn't stop burning for hours. It hurt so bad I cried. I would rate this product without any stars if I could."
5,great stuff,"Sombra is a great product. The smell is far less intense and off putting than other similar products. Yet it's just as (if not more so) effective.I deal with pain in my neck and shoulders most of the time, and applying Sombra really helps me cope with it."
1,DON'T ORDER SOMBRA VIA AMAZON,"ALTHOUGH I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, SOMBRA, I WILL NOT ORDER IT VIA AMAZON EVER AGAIN. THE PROCESS WAS CONFUSING, MY OREDER WAS NOT FILLED PROPERLY, AND I GOT TO PAY FOR ITEMS ORDERED BUT THEN NEVER RECIEVED THEM. I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL UNSATISFIED CUSTOMERS OF AMAZON. COMPAINTS WERE, UNABLE TO RETURN, OR COMPAILN FOR ITEMS PAID FOR BUT NOT RECIEVED, PRODUCTS COMING FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMPANIES EVEN THOUGH THE ITEMS WERE OF THE SAME COMPANY NAME, IMPOSTER SOMBRA!! I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE. I STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN ALL OF MY ORDER, OR BEEN GIVEN MY MONEY BACK. I SENT SOMBRA AS A GIFT TO SOMEONE, AND I AM SO EMBARRASSED. DOES AMAZON CARE????!!!"
1,accumulates ugly rust spots,"Although the design appealed to me, I found that, despite being ""stainless"" steel, it accumulates rust spots. See the pictures that I uploaded."
2,"Flaky, time will tell.","Update to my review: I've found you can't rely on the status light to indicate a full charge, but it does seem to work OK otherwise.The first time I used this, the indicator light went from red to green in less than 15 minutes. This should have indicated the battery was charged. The phone display agreed. I unplugged the phone. Half an hour later my low battery tone went off and the display showed low power. I rebooted the phone and the display showed full power. For subsequent uses I have learned not to rely on the indicator light."
1,Pillsbury Chef Melamine Papertowel Holder,"Papertowel Holder has to be assembled and the screw on the bottom of pole is not long enough to keep the pole portion screwed onto the base, possible manufacture problem. The holder can not be used."
1,Worst than the worst airplane food,"The mac and cheese with peas and corn is probably one the most disgusting things i've ever eaten. Yes, i ate it because after opening it i wouldn't dare feed it to my toddler. It even looks nasty. The vegtables have this grayish hue. It leaves the worst after taste as well. It just can't be good for you. Be nice to your child - don't feed this to them."
1,A heart attack waiting to happen!!,"I cannot give this ZERO stars. My 14mo daughter is a human trash can. She spit this out -- both the veggies AND the mac and cheese. I tasted it to find why and all I tasted was the SALT -- not the mac and cheese, not the veggie, but SALT. I would NEVER buy these to any child, EVER."
4,Enjoyed it!,"I bought this movie and I enjoyed watching it. I have read many books on Elvis. I have listened to others, who lived with the Elvis, be interviewed. This movie seems to fall into line with what everyone else has stated in the past. This movie is about ""David"" and what he saw and how he felt while touring with Elvis. I found this to be great, because I felt I was a ""fly on the wall"" to what was happening behind the scenes. The hard core Elvis fans will not like the movie because it reflects the hardships and weaknesses of Elvis. We are all human and we all have them. I dislike movies that are ""white washed"" and just show one side of a person. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see the truth about life on the road."
3,It's called PROTECTING THE KING..not this movie is about THE KING,"I'm really confused by the above reviews. This movie was originally titled ""The Headhunter"", and then retitled ""Protecting the King"". It's not about Elvis's life, it's about his step-brother's life as his bodyguard. I think if people bothered to read the description, they wouldn't be so disappointed. The move is about DAVID STANLEY'S life, not Elvis Presley's life. Overall, I thought it was an interesting perspective from someone who was there firsthand."
5,calling elvis fans,this movie is great for elvis fans to see the real elvis other reviews were neagative saying this is trash and not true how do they know this they werent there. this stepbrother was there and saw everthing it starts off from 1972 then goes to 1977. it follows dave the stepbrother dave and elvis and his frends on tour some volent scens the only complant is elvis should been fatter towards the end all rhe actors are great really great dave elvis stepbrother did the director the writtening and the producton watch the bonus mature first then watch the movie the elvis man that plays elvis acts like elvis to the tee
1,protecing the king,i cant actually comment on the film as it will not play on any of my dvd players is it for uk use i would really like to watch this film.
2,ITS NOT GREAT,"I RENTED THIS LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT IT WAS O.K THE STORY IS ABOUT DAVID NOT ELVIS...IT WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTED, I THOUGHT IT WAS MADE ON A LOW BUDGET AND IT WONT WIN ANY ACADEMY AWARDS THATS FOR SURE!!!..BUT WHY WAIT TILL NOW TO DO THIS MOVIE MAYBE DAVID IS OUT OF MONEY! THERE ARE SOME SCENES THAT ARE SAD BUT I DIDNT CARE FOR THE GUY THAT PLAYED THE KING, FIRST OF ALL ELVIS DID NOT HAVE SHORT HAIR IN THE 70'S LIKE THIS GUY AND HIS ACTING WAS O.K.. IT SEEMS LIKE DAVID PUT IN MORE EFFORD TO GET SOMEONE THAT LOOKED LIKE HIMSELF THAN THE KING!! I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU RENT IT FIRST BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS SO CALLED MOVIE!!!!!"
2,It's about Elvis but you wouldn't know it,"i only got this as a used item, as I didn't want to spend money on this at all. No where in the entire DVD is Elvis Presley's name mentioned, you just have to guess. I am sure they did not get licensing okay from EPE. I watched it and didn't hate it, but it is not exactly what you would expect."
2,Ambivalent,"Seemed like a cheap way to cash in on being Elvis' step-brother. On the other hand, it was entertaining. Also, if the story ending is true, then Mr. Stanley got a raw deal and I can understand why he felt he should tell his story his way. Elvis' name is never mentioned, so you have to imagine most of this. Elvis' persona is not tarnished too much by this film, but there is a lot of reference to the darned overdone drug stuff.If you are curious, not a bad film."
4,The new wave V. Old school,.... I can only state that the layout and information in the text is both well thought out and extremely helpful. This technique is becoming as standard and accepted as is both functional appliances and non-extraction treatment methods are currently. A well presented guide on how this technique is used and implemented currently.
1,Not Worth A Listen,"MICHAEL FREDO's debut album is unfortunately very weak. His voice is mediocre but his choice of cuts on this disc has done him total wrong! The up-tempo tunes are not catchy enough to make you want to dance and his ballads lack emotion...the only positive element? FREDO has penned several decent tunes on his album, perhaps he should pursue song-writing for other up-coming pop bands......"
4,Masterful use of the Orchestra,"The Symphony in Waves is one of the most sensuously orchestrated works of the last two decades, reminding one of early John Adams, although the musical language is different. Rautavaara with an American sound is the way I'd describe it. I have listened to this CD 5 times and even given it to friends. This is not music to Break New Grounds, but manages to have a distinctive personal sound, something to admire in an era of sound-alike composers."
2,A bit of beauty surrounded by tripe.,"I was mislead by believing other reviews of this ""masterpiece""-True, there some short beautiful sections, but most of this musicI find excessive, indulgent and contrived. Very annoying to havesuch hope, and find so little to enjoy."
2,Not a stand-up routine comedy album,"When I bought this CD I thought I was getting a comedy stand-up routine about the Christmas Holidays. Instead, these are songs that Bill Engvall co-wrote but are sung in a country/western style by studio musicians that you've never heard of. Bill introduces each song and then someone else sings them. Sometimes Bill will talk some of his comedy in the middle of the songs. Is it funny? I think it's OK. I was disappointed in the format. I thought it would be more like Jeff Foxworthy's Redneck 12 Days Of Christmas but it's more like Bob Rivers Twisted Christmas."
4,Surprising Mix,"I must say, this isn't quite what I expected out of Bill Engvall for a Christmas album. I expected wall-to-wall chuckles, but the songs he's put together for this release are an interesting mixture of comedy and genuine, sweetly emotional tunes like ""The Christmas Sign."" It's different from his usual work and different than most Christmas albums as well -- well worth it for his fans, as long as they know what they're getting."
2,Here's your review,"This CD features Bill Engvall introducing comedy songs that he wrote, which are sung by other people. Engvall sometimes does spoken parts during the songs. It's not all that funny (to me anyway)."
2,BILL ENGVALL CD,"THIS CD WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, WAS LOOKING FOR MORE SONGS DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS MORE ON A TALKING CD"
2,Christmas With Bill,"Hi folksSome of the songs are fun. I happen to find Bill Engval very funny. However, my problem with the album is that he talks before each song, ruining the mood of silliness. I went into the album with Amadeus, and edited out all of his talking and re burned it & then it played better. I'd suggest that for anyone interested in buying this album.Happy New Year! I hope that 2010 is a better one than 2009 was!Stay well everyone!"
2,Sleep Inducing Bore,Not a comedy. Tries to be a drama but has so many dull characters in it I could not pay attention all the time. Unrealistic portrayal of gay men - unless this is how they act in England. The story starts out slow and gets slower as it progresses and it finally stumbles to the end with a contrived ending that can be seen coming a mile away.
1,"Whoa, Save Your Dough",This was $22 down the drain. This product caused my computer to crash.I tried to complain to the seller. They gave me advice on how to avoid crashes.The computer game is 25 years old. It's slow and DULL! Save your money!!!!
3,"A letdown, but then.....","Phil let me down in a couple ways; his unflagging support of Juice Armstrong, and his dismissal of all non-road Olympic cycling, just did it for me. The ""Voice of the Tour"" exists for me no longer -- nor does the book."
4,Fantastic Water Workouts,I am using this book as a guideline when I work out at the pool. I wish the pictures were illustrated better~they seem a little dark and hard to follow. This book contains lots of valuable information for beginners.
4,Good Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I like histirical fiction. Therefore, I enjoyed the interaction of the three main characters in each of the three stoties represented."
2,"not as good as the ""Company of Rogues"" books","Nowhere near as good as the ""Company of Rogues"" books. Full of meaningless dialogue and long, boring sections of the character's thoughts. Entire pages should have been edited out as unnecessary."
2,"3 handsome, troubled heroes that u like to love but......","I like stories of friendships esp male bonding like jo beverley's ""rogues"". They prove that strong men can and do have deep feelings and deep friendships. Because of the relationship of these 3 heroes it made sense to republish as an anthology. The problem is, it is a huge book that take forever to read because it is so wordy. The characters are great and have depth.But where I liked ""the devils heiress"", I hated the ""dragons' bride"" and demon's mistress was only so-so. Thus the overall rating for the book is low.Definitely not worth the price.........."
2,not so great,these tapes do not stick as good as I would have preferred ... I would use them only for very light duty sticking purposes!
1,Garbage,"This tape is a worthless product.The adhesion properties are poor and if it was`nt such a hassle, I would have returned this garbage for a refund."
1,Too salty,I can't describe the flavor of the meat since all I could taste was salt. A 1 oz. 'serving' contains 29% of sodium Daily Value. Golden Valley Jerky (4 oz. pack) shows 16% salt about half with good flavor. Golden Valley is ecommended.Jack's comes in a 3.65 oz. package.In addition to Golden Valley I recommend Trader Joe's Turkey Jerky if you are near a store.
2,Stale,This product is by far the most tasty and delicious jerky one can find. However I think its been sitting in an Amazon warehouse too long and taste stale. I would buy it at the grocery store but all of them have stopped carrying the turkey in the Dallas area.
4,Turkey Jerky...,Must have been good because I only had a few bites...My family ate the rest so fast I never had anymore... I really enjoyed the little I did have...Next time I will hide some for myself...
4,Tastes good and not dry,This turkey version of Jack Link's is hard to find in stores. It is less dry than is hard to find in stores. It is less dry than the beef which beef which is as plus. Not quite as flavorful as the buffalo which is the best of all.
3,Good deal for a textbook,You can't beat the service and value. Good deal for a textbook. Would do it again and recommend to a friend.
1,Junk,"Forget the other reviews, these are junk. They almost made the perfect product, but fell short with the plastic top piece - beware if you are not a whimp and tighten the screws to tight, the plastic will snap."
3,Good ideas - not geared for CA law,"This is a good product, and gave good insights into how to write bar essays. It is not specifically geared to CA, which is fine if you aren't in CA. I learned some techniques and strategies that I have applied and improved my essays. It does not provide a lot of samples that I found helpful, but the instruction part is good."
2,Not helpful.,"I found this book to be incredibly unhelpful. The author does not offer good strategies for approaching the exam, and includes essays from a range of jurisdictions, which can be confusing at worst and just unhelpful at best. i thought the Adachi books were much better."
4,Review on Bar Review Prep,I thought this book was pretty useful. It was more effective for me to learn writing bar exam essays in this manner in comparison to BarBri.
5,Great book!,"Very informative and detailed. Essays provide great guidance. This book should be a required book for not only the bar, but also law school."
5,Thumbs UP!,"My son, a 2nd year law student, has given this book a thumbs up. He received it last year and has used it many times in the last year. Although we have another year before the Bar Exam, I can tell you that it has helped his essay writing for daily coursework! I am sure that those that have already passed the Bar will help you more from that aspect, but I thought you might like hearing a review from this perspective!"
3,This book is really basic.,"Point: I was not very impressed and after skimming it, I didn't look at it much before the bar exam. My tip for you would be bar takers out there... try getting some Law in a Flash cards instead. I took the PA bar and basically only used these to study. No Barbri, wish I could have saved money and not bought this book too.Counterpoint: This book focused me and an provided me with a really helpful way to structure my exam answers. I recommend it as a cheap must have addition to your bar study.Truth: Somewhere in the middle."
5,Very helpful if you practice the techniques,Six suggestions when using this insightful approach to the bar exam by Dr. Gallagher:1. Listen to her tapes2. Read her book and essays3. Read old exam answers from your jurisdiction4. Use Dr. Gallagher's strategy to answer any subject essay question5. Read her book again and sample essays6. Read her book again and sample essaysYou have now passed the Bar exam!
3,Alright depending on your state and level of skill,I bought this book because I'm trying to pass the bar exam after previous attempts. This book was mentioned on a couple of law schools' websites so I decided to give it a try. It has some decent tips that can help improve your approach to an essay such as how to outline and what to include in your outline. The author tries to break down CIRAC/IRAC in different exercises. It can be a helpful book depending on your skill-level.
2,Not worth the money,"I'm a struggling 3rd year law school student who wants to avoid the humiliation of failing the bar exam. Many bar prep courses teach you the law, but they don't specifically tell you how to execute the essays. I've searched everywhere for a NY-specific essay book, but for the life of me, I can't find a single one. This book is not completely useless. It tells you how to IRAC correctly on the bar. It also showed excellent answers compared to mediocre answers. Nevertheless, it wasn't worth the $50 I spent. If it was all New York material then it would be worth $100, but it contained essays from Nebraska, Utah, and Vermont. Seriously? I think Barbri and Kaplan are colluding with each other since the only semi-decent essay materials are from their respective companies."
2,Kinda but No,"I thought this book would be more helpful. I would have given it 3 stars but I also got Nailing the Bar 'how to write bar exam essays' which was so good that this one by comparison is a waste of money. Also I used this book and got the lowest essay scores possible with the exception of leaving my answers blank- that was for July 12. So had to find something better than this one. Nailing the Bar actually has much more helpful information in my opinion. So yes I regret buying this guide. Basically essay preparation for the bar is so non-existent that I panic bought a bunch of bar essay writing books and none have helped, which is why am retaking the bar. Bought nailing the bar about a month ago and it is an eye opener, i highly recommend."
2,Totally Autumn Plains,Autumn Plains home is the only place much needed for this guide.Except you should know to charge into the walls with cracks in them.And Metro Speedway.This guide is actually not all that helpful.
3,sad lives,"I bought this book without knowing much of anything about it. The story is fine. The characters are well described. My problem isn't so much about the book as about the shift in society. I'm tired of hearing about marraiges that have dissolved, children raised by one parent, the messed up people this turmoil creates. I long for the days where a marraige is for life. If something isn't going well, you work your hardest to fix it. I realize that there are marraiges that should not continue & do not fault the innocent party in such a situation. The Wishing Box shows the bond of two sisters despite the absence of their father and distance of their mother. I've not yet finished reading it, but will & anticipate there will be moments from the book that will stick with me."
3,misleading,"We thought this was going to be a kite, guess maybe we didn't read closely enough but w/ GO FLY A KITE in the title we figured that's what it was plus the picture leads you to belive that is acurate. I guess good if you're looking for a yard decoration but we ordered it for a 7 year olds b-day present, so not the best in this case."
4,RIP OFF!!! GREAT PRODUCT BUT RIP OFF PRICE BY RESELLER!,"Honestly folks, Legos are great and a lot of little girls love and would love this product, but DO NOT SPEND OVER $[...] DOLLARS FOR THIS PRODUCT!!! Some company is trying to rip you off because your daughter would love a princess or mermaid lego set... As the other review said, this product used to cost 30 or maybe [...] dollars. This is an absolute SCAM that even Amazon should be ashamed of having listed on its website."
3,Fair performance degraded by recording engineers,"This is a difficult piece, and very sensitive. It is beautiful on its own. In this recording of the Ceremony, though, the choir lacks the expected precision, and the cathedral echo blurs the fineness of the close harmonies. The harp is too loud in comparison to the choir in many places: out of balance. Sigh. It is certainly listenable, there are no obvious flaws, but I find myself wanting to hear it in a small chamber with limited (or no) reverberation, perhaps with only one left and right microphone. This music can be ""felt"" when done properly. I'm only hearing it."
3,From one of the performers...........,"With reference to one of the other reviews, there are many recordings of this piece recorded in a sterile studio environment. One of the distinctive qualities of a King's recording is the reality of the recording being done in the chapel where the choir sings 6 times a week. Oh, and amazon, sort it out. The name's Body not Brody. You're thinking of the librarian from Indiana Jones. Rated this one three stars as we did better. The ""English Anthems"" CD is one example"
3,bargain-basement build quality,"I am giving this merchandise 3 stars because it works as described but the LED's are not very bright or luminous. I am skeptical about the dependability of this product in fire, rain, snow, nuclear war, etc. because of its bargain-basement build quality.This product looks of inferior quality and I am very disappointed with the essential build quality.On top of that it looks like a laser gun from a Star Geek convention."
5,Let there be Light!,"I purchased several Dynamo's this Christmas; three for woman to use in their cars for emergencies, and one for myself, because I got tired of needing a flashlight, only to discover that the batteries were dead. No more!"
5,Great Little tool,great little tool no more batteries. Shine a little light on a British invention. Just the job for these dark corners
2,Dynamo Illuminator Wind-up LED flash light does not work well.,The light works sporadically and have to shake it to keep the lights on. This is peculiar to this one item not other I've seen and used. This particular one is defective.
3,Not very bright,"This flashlight produces a fairly dim, smoky bluish light that is disappointing after all the reviews claiming the light is bright. It's not. Still, I guess that fact that it doesn't require batteries may be reason enough to have one on hand."
1,Bealls did a Bait and Switch,"I ordered several ""Illuminator"" flashlights. Bealls said ""Illuminator"" on their order confirmation, but shipped ""Dynamo."" They have now changed picture and description, and lowered the price. Will not order from them again.When I tried to crank up the first flashlight, rotating knob froze up, and broke off in my hand. I tested three others, and light is only bright while crank is turning. It dims when cranking stops, and fades very quickly to no useful light. Switch functions as off/off/off/on---obviously something wrong. There is compartment for optional batteries, with plastic cover that keeps falling off. Will return all, but am very irritated about paying the shipping for a bait and switch."
1,Bealls is not worthy to be connected to Amazon.com,I didn't received the correct items from Bealls. Reading through the reviews it looks like the have a consistent pattern of screwing up. I never seen so many negative reviews. Most of the issues seem to point to poor quality control at Bealls. I say you should drop them from your site before the destroy your good reputation. Bealls never had the common courtesy to return my call or answer my email. Thanks to customer service at Amazon they are working on correcting my problem. I will never buy anything from them again.
1,Arrived broken,The handle to charge ths light was broken on arrival. It seemed to be cheaply made. I would not buy this brand again.
2,Broken Handle the First Use,These lights are a great concept... The light seems to work fine... We'll see what happens when the light runs out of change and the handle is broken... Broke after one use... It'll still work in a pinch...
2,Made in China,"Did not have the time to enjoy it for our boyscout trip I bought it for... I received it in the mail on Friday am, and we left at noon for the week end. When I attempted to turn the crank to charge it, the pin that is attaching the turn crank-handle to the flashlight, fell down in the dirt, the handle came off...and whe could not crank/charge the flashlight anymore!Thank you ""made in China""...as usual! otherwise it appears to be a great flashlight with 2 light intensity! Now rendered useless with no crank handle!Wasted $10 so to speak!"
1,Died after 30 days,"This product died after 30 days after using it once. I bought this for use if there is a blackout. After I received it I tested the hand crank and the light come on. Thinking that it will work when I would need it in the future, I stored it without using it again. I happen to recently try to use it, cranked it several times for several minutes no light.This product is unreliable and could not be depended on in an emergency situatioin. I could not return it because it was past 30 days since I bought it."
1,Like throwing money in the garbage can,"Save your money. This was like throwing my money in the trash. Bought 3 of these last year. Used them to make sure they worked. Used once in the fall, them put them in my emergency kit. During a 36 hour power outage I pulled them out of the emergency kit and cranked them up. Light only worked while I was cranking. Cranked two for 30 minutes still didn't work. Wasted money and still in the dark..."
1,Won't hold power at all,Got it as a gift. Really terrible. Just avoid. Wont hold a charge at all after 2 years of very infrequent use.
4,good for emergencies,"I bought this flashlight to save on disposable batteries. The light has two modes, 1 bulb and 3 bulbs. 1 bulb is bright enough and 3 bulbs could light up an entire room.It does not have a loop to attached a strap to attached to your wrist to prevent dropping it."
3,Handy light,"I bought these for Christmas gifts for the family. The idea is great, crank a little and you have light. Works great but the 3 leds spray the light beam all over, not much good if you need a big area lit up. Works when you can't find a flashlight with a good battery. Next one I buy will have more leds and a convergent beam."
2,Wrong Item,"I really dont know if these are better but I was NOT sent what I ordered!they sent me a cheaper version of what I actually ordered, and charged me for the more expensive item. I ordered 5 of these The Illuminator LED Crank Flashlightat a cost of $11.99 and I was sent Dynamo LED Crank Flashlight which is advertised at $9.99I don't want to return them, as I have planned to use them as Christmas Presents, but I do expect to be reimbursed for the price discrepancy. My 2 stars is not for the item, but for the order mess up, they could have at least notified me and givin me a choice on if I wanted this item or to cancell my order."
1,Christian,"Bought this a year ago, don't waste your money. Illumination is a joke. You're lucky if you can see a dime on the counter in the dark. Don't expect it to guide you out of darkness. A match has 10 times the illumination."
2,Does Not Last an Hour,"From the manufacturer, ""60 seconds of winding for 1 hour of light"". This is patently false. If you turn on the light and wind it while using it, I suppose it could, also it's a lot brighter when winding it. As soon as you stop winding it gets a lot less bright and in about 2 minutes becomes so dim that it isn't very useful for any real purpose.I suppose if you want a light that you can count on for a mad max post-apocalyptic world where there is no more power and no more batteries, this would be your only real choice. I have the light for 2 years now and it still works, even with kids using it as a child's toy, so I'd say it's durable. But as you can see, we just let the kids play with it as it not very useful."
3,My personal experiment results,"I have one of these. It's ok for keeping in the car and/or camping. It produces light which is the point. Mine does not give enough light for me unless I am cranking while the light is on. I've tried the crank, then turn on and it just doesn't hold the charge very long at all and the light dulls pretty rapidly. I'm not sure if there is something wrong with the battery or what... it's brand new. For a test I took my crank light and my grandpa's shake light outside to compare them and the shake light works so much more efficiently. I shook for the same amount of time that I cranked (30 seconds) and the results were majorly in the shake lights favor. It was nice and bright and held the brightness while my poor little LED crank light dulled out and never even got to the same brightness of the shake light. They're pretty evenly priced, so if I could go back I would definately be getting a shake light."
1,Terrible,Barely lights a small room.Even after cranking it for some time it runs out of power in five minutes.I bought two and when the electricity went down recently they were useless.
1,Had for a year....going in garbage can.,"I have just spent the last 3 minutes cranking this thing at about 3 cranks a second. It stayed lit for a whopping 30 seconds, and then was black. The batteries used to hold their charge better than this, but now that we have had them for a while, they are absolutely useless. The last thing I want in a blackout, with scared kids, is to think that I can rely on this light source and find out that the batteries no longer hold any charge. Will get another, but not this brand."
1,It broke 30 seconds out of the box,The handle broke right out of the box. Not well made. I cant complain about the light yet but so many other people commented the light does not work well also so I will just return it. Thanks for nothing Dynamo.
2,Mediocre performance for an emergency light!,"I own several crank style flashlights and even crank flashlight/radio combos for emergency use and for travel. This one is probably the one I like the least. It is hard to charge and it does not hold the charge very long. The crank is very easy to turn but you have to crank it very fast, 2 to 3 turns per second, to even build up a reasonable charge. Other units I have are much harder to turn and as the batteries in the flashlights charge they progressively get harder to turn.This flashlight at its best could hold a 10 minute charge but even after limited use it quickly declined to about 3 to 5 minutes. Other units I own can operate the flashlight for up to 1 hour and the charging took the same time at slower cranking speeds. For dependability and the duration of the light, this one is not a good selection. You should look for better alternatives."
2,battery dies after one year,"I bought this at Costco - 2 for $20 or so. Worked great at first, but then one of the charger handle gears broke. After a year, the remaining one wouldn't charge well, and then wouldn't charge at all. So, had to find this rare rechargeable battery, found one, and now it sort of works.Not reliable - won't buy again."
2,Light is so-so,"The illumination on this wind up flash light is sort of laughable. I bought one of these and my husband asked if I could please buy a real flashlight. Intent on proving him wrong, I always brought it out and tried to use it whenever it was needed. But, I had to finally admit he was right; the light was TERRIBLE. I dropped it once and it fell apart. The was the end of our Dynamo Illuminator. Won't be buing it again."
2,Does not hold a charge,"I got this flashlight because it was cheaper than the LL Bean dynamo light it was replacing. I ended up returning this light and just buying the LL Bean flashlight again.There are two problems with this light. First, it doesn't hold a charge. If you wind this up for a few hours to use later, the charge will have dissipated and will have to wind it again. I could understand if it were a few days, but it shouldn't be hours.Second, the handle is very poor. It wobbles, making winding more cumbersome than it needs to be.I don't recommend this light for emergency use, as I was going to. It wasn't reliable to use for everyday so I returned it."
2,No batteries and kinda weak,This light works pretty well right after being charged but the charge doesn't last too long. This was ok at first but it is getting worse.
2,heat wave,Some parts were missing and it needed a direct access to outside. The product didn't work correctly and I tried to send it back but shipper claims Delivery company damaged during shipment. Still waiting for claim/refund.
2,Not so great.,"I am glad that I only ordered the 1 lb bag. I got this one and the Cookies and Cream flavor. They are both really weird. The taste is better than some proteins Ive had before, but not the best. The texture... is well.. YUCK. Some protein shakes are too thick, these are too thin - even with only 6 oz of water. I have mixed it with Vanilla Soy as well, which only made is slightly better tasting and a slightly better texture. I wont be reordering. If I could, I would send it back."
1,Doesn't mix well at all!!!!!!!,"I've found other protein mixes WAY better than this crap. It doesn't taste good either. I bought it, used it 5 times, and now it just sits there cause I can't mix it at all. It's chunky and never can get wet. Terrible"
2,"impossible to use in blender, tastes awful too","this product expands in volume by 2 times, at least which means trying to blend it into a fruit smoothie or even with water in a blender is a complicated process involving removing half, blending the rest adding the half back and blending it. It is also unpalatable when it is just air filled foam which more than 50% is after blending. Maybe mix it with a spoon in a glass of water???? with nothing added it would be nasty for sure."
3,"taste ok, texture not-so-good","I bought if for the killer price (less than $30 shipping and taxes included), but I don't think I'll get it again next time.I got the ""chocolate surge"": the dark-chocolate taste is ok, but it's a little bitter and not sweet enough for me.It's pretty hard to get it dissolved completely even with my blender bottle: there are always little lumps or floating stuff after shaking for a minute or so in cold milk. I tried with hot milk and it's almost worse. I've been using for a while the whey protein from Cutting Edge Labs and it was better tasting and it always dissolving completely in my shakes.I was expecting something better from a brand name like Twinlab."
3,chocolate surrrrrggggeeeeeeeeeee,"it's protein.it's delicious.there is healthier options out there though.. so after i got this delicious (really, it's good.. i was wondering if i was tricked and just given chocolate powder) i went for optimum nutrition's chocolate. not as good, but healthier.. so can't go wrong.either way, for the price, it's worth it if you don't mind the cholesterol."
3,Noob to protein shakes,"Well for me this one tasted pretty good with cold water, and tasted better if you use milk.I've been using this for about 3wks, one shake within 30min after a work out. I can't really compare the difference between shakes and no shakes after a work-out, but I am pretty satisfied with the taste of this product."
3,50/50,"I always buy Vanilla protein and this has to be the worst tasting I have ever purchased. It kind of taste like banana flavor. Other than that, the protein levels are good and it is easy to mix before and after workout plus it's a great deal."
3,"For it's price, it's a decent product..","It's mix-ability is terrible. Don't even attempt to mix it without a shaker-bottle. And the taste is good if you mix with half cup milk and the rest water. Otherwise, with just water, it's a little too thin. But for it's price (with the free shipping), it's a pretty decent product."
3,3 1/2 Stars: Very Good Price & Very Bland Taste,"It is my believe that all whey protein are similar in quality. The distributers buy from the same/similar place as everyone else, add some miscellaneous ingredients and snazzy labels to distinguish themselves, and work their marketing mojo.Thus, I only look for the most cost efficient whey from a time tested brand, to save cash and avoid crap.Twin Lab and the special pricing with an Amazon subscription met this requirements. But I'll have to unsubscribe, since the taste (Chocolate) left me wanting, and there are always specials on whey protein around the web.In summary, if you are looking for a good price and ok taste, this fits the bill. But I am going to continue looking for something better tasting."
2,Low quality whey,"I was enticed by the Twin Labs 100% Whey because it's one of the cheapest whey protein supplements on Amazon. However, I found the taste to be very artificial, and I was not surprised when I looked on the label and saw a long list of artificial ingredients. I would not recommend this product to someone who cares deeply about what they're putting into their body. The next protein I buy will be a higher quality product, even if it's more expensive."
2,Not so great.,"I am glad that I only ordered the 1 lb bag. I got this one and the Vanilla Surge flavor. They are both really weird. The taste is better than some proteins Ive had before, but not the best. The texture... is well.. YUCK. Some protein shakes are too thick, these are too thin - even with only 6 oz of water. I have mixed it with Vanilla Soy as well, which only made is slightly better tasting and a slightly better texture. I wont be reordering. If I could, I would send it back."
5,Twinlab chocolate surge,"Good product. Mixes well, tastes good, and excellent value. I will definately purchase this product again. I have only tried three different protein powders but I like this one the best so far. This product is 1000x better than the chocolate NutriBiotic rice protein that I tried last time."
4,Great product for the price,"Hi, I recently purchased this product on Amazaon and let me tell you ""is a great product"" and will continue to purchase it, It has all the nutrients for the muscle cells and tissues that my body needs. I feel great During and after each work out and has a very great taste, not to mention this is a really big bottle for the price I got it for. I like to mix mine with natural Fruits such as strawberries and pineapple (Great combination).I compared this product with other ones i have bought at GNC or other retailers and they rip you off telling you that what they sell has other things that other products don't (not True guys)try it, is money well spent."
5,"Tastes great, and much cheaper then ON","After using ON (Optimum Nutrition) whey protein for quite a while, they decided to cancel their ""subcribe & save"" offer on Amazon. I decided to try Twinlab due to the fact that it's essentially the same specs as ON but much cheaper, and it actually tastes pretty awesome. Can't beat the price for a 5lb container; definitely recommended!"
3,"Haven't used the product, but read this","I was looking at the servings per container information for this product and other whey protein products. Amazon doesn't have such information but other websites do. Even though this is a good $5 - $10 cheaper than some other 5lb containers of whey protein, it also has fewer servings. ON's 5lb container has 75-80 servings versus 65 servings in this container. Per serving, ON is cheaper."
1,Great price not great product,"It doesn't taste very good. I dont really complain too much about flavor cuz you can just down it but what killed it for me was the mixing. HORRIBLE mixing, stays loaded with chunks and sometimes the bottom just stays stuck to the shake bottle. If you take your protein with you on-the-go like I do, don't go with this product."
1,Poor Flavor,This product has and empty flavor and does not mix well. I would not buy this product again. I tried this product for a change from my syntha 6 routine. Fail on my part I will never leave Syntha 6 again.
3,GOOD FOR THE PRICE BUT SYNTHA 6 TASTE BETTER....,The best part of this product is that it's affordable. You can't get a better price for a Whey protein than this. The bad part is that it doesn't mix very well and it doesn't taste as good as Syntha 6. From what I heard ON Whey is the best but I haven't tried them yet.
5,Great Product,Great tasting product and mixes well with water and any sort of fruit. Taste is comparable to a milk shake while only consuming healthly ingrediants.
3,PROTEIN,"I wasn't a fan of this protein mainly because of the taste. I could deal with it if I was broke and had to use what I paid for, but instead I just gave it to a co-worker for a few bucks. I probably only had a handful of shakes out of the whole container. The guy I gave it to really seems to like it and says he will buy more of it, but as for me I did not like the flavor."
3,How much is one scoop,"I wish I had known about the measurement requirements for using Twinlab's Whey Protein. When the product arrived I checked the label for dosage info--which indicated either 1 scoop into 6 oz water or 2 scoops into 12 oz.After opening the container I found no scoop anywhere to be found--even when using a long-handled serving spoon and plunging it repeatedly to the bottom of the container and using a stirring motion as well.Upon checking the label again I learned that 1 scoop was equal to 35 grams.Convert grams to pounds or ounces dry weight?On-line conversion tables were ambiguous at best.Now what?Do I overdose--or ""underdose?"" Over- would probably not be harmful; under- would be ineffective and a waste of time and of the product.[Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.]"
4,Only worth it on sale.,"I got this when it was $25.12. I wouldn't pay any more than that for it. This batch has a quality problem(I've had others that were fine) and there's white spots that won't mix no matter what you do. It doesn't taste good but it's also not nasty. It's just bland. When it's at the cheaper prices it's definitely worth it, but not for retail price."
5,great,This is really cheap but still low in carbs and fat. Quality protein. I'm gonna get buff. Thanks a lot for it
4,I Will Order This Again,"As far as protein powders go, this one does not taste offensive. This also blends well and masks the flavor of the multivitamin powder that I toss into the blender. I will certainly reorder this product."
3,Had Better,A little disappointed in the product. Mixes ok and tastes ok. Cholesterol is higher than I like. Two servings make 50 grams of protien.
4,Great protein,"I got this for about 40 dollars which in a great deal on protein.the taste was alright, certainly not the best but not that bad either.I'd definitely recommend this for anyone on a cut, with only 130 calories per 25 grams of protein it's ideal."
3,CHOcoLATE,"The price is reasonable. I got the chocolate surge and he taste is very good. The cholesterol ratio is a little high in comparison with other models. The only problem is that it doesn't dissolve at least as easily as the previous Whey Protein that I had. In general, I am satisfied with it."
4,Good Product at an Excellent Price,The price per pound for the 5 lb. size of Twinlab Whey Protein powder is just about the most economical that I could find. The chocolate flavor is good mixed with plain water (a blender is advised) but two scoops + 10 oz. of skim milk + a banana make an excellent thick-shake. (I also add a tablespoon of milled flax seed for Omega-3 and fiber). I blend it up and put the blender jar in the fridge before leaving for the gym. Two hours later I re-blend and drink the entire shake before heading for the shower. The only downside is the surprising cholesterol content of this product (60mg or 21% of DV per scoop); for those of us with high cholesterol 4 scoops per day leaves very little leeway for anything else. I wish the cholesterol content was a bit lower.
3,Pretty Good,"This is packed with protein, low carbs, low calorie and one scoop is enough to get me through the morning. My critique is that it leaves a chalky after taste in my mouth. All in all it's not bad."
3,Doesn't mix well,This tastes pretty good and mixes fine in a blender. Not so much in a shaker cup. Stirring with a spoon is right out.
4,sweet deal,taste: great like strawberry milk shake;effectiveness: not known yet; I just had them for a weeksolubility: not hard to be mixted with water and takes about no more than 1 minute
4,"GOOD TASTE, A LITTLE HARD TO MIX",Good taste and great price. You can't get better bang for your buck if your looking for a basic Whey shake. It is a little tough to mix but you just chug it down anyway so no real big deal there. Great for post workout nutrition when you aren't hungry enough or are to busy to stop and make a meal after.
4,Great tasting protein power with one issue.,"This is a great tasting protein, and believe me I have tasted so many brands it not funny. The only issue I noticed with this protein as compare to a tub of Optimum Nutrition is that the serving size is HUGE! The Optimum nutrition scoop is half the size of the Twin Lab scoop. I compared the nutrient facts and Twin lab has 3 more grams of carb and an extra gram of fat. Nevertheless, the scoope is twice the size. Optimum Nutrition is definitely higher quality, but Twin Lab tastes better."
1,Ridiculous Inflation,"Only 8 months ago this exact product was $27 shipped, and the price has since slowly but steadily risen. Just a month or two ago it was around $30. Now it's $45 for the cheapest. That is a 60% increase. Are the ingredients becoming more expensive? The other brand's prices have remained consistent. Now it is not the cheapest whey (for the protein/cost) so it really has no advantage anymore, because it does not taste as good as the other brands. Chocolate surge tastes bad in water. It all tastes adequate or worse."
5,WheyToGo,"""Dissolved easily. Great in a smoothie with a frozen banana. Very happy with this whey protein.""""not chalky, has good flavor, great value!"""
5,best protein ever,Twinlab has done it again. this protein is the best it has over 50g of protein in 2 servings. the best part of this protein has all the amio acids in it. I been useing it for over 8 weeks. I order it ever 4 weeks
1,it's okay....,this stuff is okay but not my first choice. it only mixes well in a blender and dissolves poorly. the price is attactive.
1,Lack of communication,"I ordered this product thinking it would have arrived at the estimated ship date. I understand, products can and will go on back order from time to time. However, I recieved no communication that such an issue had arisen. I am doing 2 a days to get in shape for the air force and I don't have the protein I need. I am not close to what would be considered happy at all. Total disappointment with this seller. I highly suggest you inquire elsewhere."
1,Disgusting.... BLECH!,"What happened to Twin Labs?? They used to make great tasting stuff- not this junk. Head over to Lowes and pick up some spackling mix, throw in a blender with some dog nuggets from the front yard and you'll have a better tasting smoothie :-O"
1,Awful product; dont buy,"I bought this product 4 months back and I could drink this garbage only few times. each time I drank, my stomach felt little weird (like added weight) and want to lie down. Taste is awful and every time I drank, I have to drink a soda to make me fee better. I was told by my doctor not to drink this product. He also suggested me to take gas-x if I am facing this problem. This is my first protein powder and I didn't realise that I will throw them in garbabe. Waste of money. This taught me a lesson - not to buy any big product without trying in a small size or sampler size. One star is way too much for this awful product."
4,Worth a try,"I kept comparing this to the Optimum Nutrition double chocolate protein and it came up short in almost every category except price. The taste is not bad, but it's a little gritty. I suspect it's the extra sandpaper flakes that they add for maximum absorption. The scoop size is huge. Raisin Bran has got nothing on two scoops of this mess. It dissolves pretty similarly to the ON brand, which was surprising for the scoop size. The price for this is great. Subscribe and save and this is half the price of similar products. All in all a solid product that will do what you need on a budget."
3,Average,I have tried many whey proteins. Picked this up when it was on sale for ~$25. It was good for the price but the protein just seemed average to me. Also it does not mix well with a spoon. I had to spend at least 2-3 minutes stirring before it finally mixed.
5,Twinlab 100% Whey Protein,"Great buy for amount you get.Great tasting, easy to use in a blender. I will purchase this again when I finish this jug."
5,Get a Delicious and Nutritious Chocolate Drink Mix at Amazon.com,After a bracing workout I enjoy a hearty chocolate drink by mixing Twinlab Whey Protein Fuel into a glass of milk. Tastes great and gives my muscles the protein they need for replacing cells lost to the workout. Can't think of a better way to rebuild muscle.
5,Twinlab 100% Whey Protein Fuel,"I'm very satified with the Twinlab 100% Whey Protein Fuel. It is a high quality and inexpensive product. It contains less sugar and more protein per volume than other comparable brands. It is easily dissolving in water (milk, juice etc.) and tastes good. I will buy this again."
4,Scoop size is not accurate,"The serving size in the label says 1 scoop (33g) that contains 25g of protein. But the scoop included in the bottle can have up to 45g aprox. i weighed that with a digital scale.So, that can only mean two things:- They make a mistake with the scoop and the protein per 1 leveled scoop (45g) is 34g (we sill getting the same amount of protein per bottle). 5g carbs and 3g fat- We are getting less protein per serving/bottle. Twinlab seems a reputable company and the price is good but not too low compared with other proteins so i think it's just a scoop/label mistake.*This is the same with the chocolate surge flavor."
1,"I never bought this product, why is it on my list","What is this, I don't use this. I am an old man what the hell are you talking about to me"
2,Terrible Taste,"I was happy with the Chocolate Surge flavored product, so I figured the Strawberry Smash couldn't be too bad. It tastes so vile I have to hold my nose and drink it as fast as I possibly can. I enjoyed the taste and results of the Chocolate Surge, but the price has risen on that flavor and the Strawberry seems to be made of much cheaper products. The ingredients are significantly different and the aftertaste is so bad after drinking that this product requires a chaser to go with it. I am considering giving away the rest of this and recommend another brand."
4,Tastes pretty decent,"I purchased this product recently and within 3 weeks I put on 10 pounds. I've never really taken whey protein before so I have nothing to compare this with, but I think it tastes great and is pretty filling. I drink two scoops with water after working out and I see the results. I'm going to start mixing with milk and I'm sure it will taste better.. I prefer chilled but its not bad room temp."
4,Debbie Harry's voice is made for jazz!,"I must confess I bought this CD as a Blondie/Debbie Harry fan rather than a jazz afficianado.Debbie Harry's solo efforts have been largely disco orientated. From the point of view of a fan used to the more 'rocky' Blondie sound I have always found this slightly frustrating. However, now is the chance to here Debbie explore further the realm of jazz, as first heard on the excellent 'Faces' on Autoamerican, an under-rated Blondie track, but one that has stood the test of time well.Debbie has an excellent voice, and the songs range from humerous to more traditional smooth, jazzy ballads and love songs. One of the highlights is to here Debbie duet with Elvis Costello on 'Doncha Go 'Way Mad'. Elvis Costello also writes and sings another track, 'Aubergine'. There is an excellent 'jazzy' version of 'The Tide Is High' with Chris Stein on guitar.All in all a great CD that I will listen to, from start to finnish, again and again."
2,Should have been smarter,"A 20mm f1.8 prime for $400.00? What was I thinking? At f1.8 the lens is unacceptably soft. Better at 2.8, but still not great. It's not until f4 that the Sigma matched the sharpness of my Nikon 17-55 f2.8 zoom. A full stop slower! This begs the question - what is the point of having this lens if it's soft until f4? Answer - no point at all. Sending it straight back."
1,What a let down!,"after reading all the reviews, I decided to pull the trigger and went ahead with purchasing this lens.It was shipped two days later and I immediately performed several test to check sharpness, IQ, and BQ.What can i say, Sigma and their quality control has done it again.the lens was loud and not as sharp as i thought it would be. Soft unless you are shooting at around f5.6 and lower.that is all..."
2,Bummer,"I think it would be a decent lens, but does not work with the Nikon D7000. Wish someone had said something before buying.:("
5,Absolutely fabulous images,"I've had this lens for three years. It takes absolutely wonderful portraits. If you want to see someone as you have never seen them before, take a full frame portrait shot of them using a Canon 10D or 20D with this lens. Gorgeous.The lens rounds out such shots just slightly and really enhances facial features. The effect is almost like a very mild fisheye. I have used this to create some of the most compelling captures of the human range of facial expressions that I've ever taken.Highly recommended product. Stunning clarity. John Kahrs was wrong in his review. Either he had a defective lens or he has some sort of disability that kept him from using it correctly.This Sigma lens is an excellent value compared to similar Canon lenses, although both brands are of high quality, in my experience."
3,As good as ever - but insignificant upgrade,"That Adobe Photoshop is the #1 image processing software is undisputed. But because less costly competitors like Corel PhotoPaint are catching up, I saw the need for a really big upgrade to secure the lead. But if you are looking for any breakthroughs, they aren't there. If you already own 5.5, I doubt you will need this upgrade. Other than that: a really great application."
5,My favorite Christmas album,"If it's possible to wear out a cd, then the amount of time I spend listening to this one will prove the theory. This is to me the finest cd from the finest choir producing Christmas music anywhere. The arrangements are beautiful with high descants that are spine-chilling. There's a nice mix of familiar carols with a few not-so, and my only complaint is I'd like more of them; it's a relatively short cd. No matter. I've given this as a gift to people who then give the same response, so purchase with confidence and anticipation."
3,Sound confusion,"Be aware that even though this TV has a pair of speakers it is NOT a stereo TV. The comparable stereo model is model number 25TS56C 25"". I ordered this TV tonite thinking it was stereo, but then found out different by comparing prices and models from another site. So since I haven't received the TV yet I give it a 3 star rating. I just wanted others to not make the same mistake I did! I will hook this TV up thru a stereo VCR and an audio receiver so I can still experience stereo sound if I want. Still this a good deal with the free shipping and no taxes!"
5,My daughter loves this book,"I highly recommend it. She enjoys the rhyming and has even memorized portions. We read it several times a week. Not sure how much it has helped her potty training, but she asks for it by name ""Potty Me!"""
3,pretty book,Not made a difference in her learning to potty but she likes the pictures and it helps to reinforce my message. She'll be ready when she's ready.
3,"Also see ""The Potty Book"" for girls by Cqapucilli","We love Karen Katz' ""Counting Kisses"", so I was curious to look at this new book from her. What strikes me is that the words of the book that are available on Amazon.com appear very close to those of a great book called, ""The Potty Book for girls"" by Alyssa Satin Capucilli, copyright 2000. For instance, Capucilli's book ends with the words, ""I am proud of...ME!"" just as Karen Katz's book ends. Also the storyline sounds nearly identical in Katz' book as in Capucilli's book. Anyway I would not doubt both are good books but do check out ""The Potty Book, for girls"" by Capucilli as well. The story and illustrations are top notch and our family reads it often with our two year old."
3,Toddler not interested in this book,"I don't know if it's because he doesn't quite understand the concept yet but my 2 year old isn't interested in this potty book. He sits on his potty all the time ""practicing"" the act but this book does nothing for him at this time."
2,just okay,This book was just OK for me. I didn't really like the way the story evolved..and I think the video and other sources I found will be better than this particular book. Just my honest opinion.
5,Daughter loves this book.,"My 21 month old LOVES this book- I have to read it to her at least 3 times A DAY right now. She's a bit obsessed- we're just starting to potty train and she loves pointing to the picture at bathtime and yelling ""baby butt"". And now she babbles when sitting on the potty. It's making the process fun!"
5,A great potty training book.,I've used this book when my older daughter was going through potty training. Now we are doing the same for our youngest. I loved how it emphases that it's okay to have a mishap and just to keep on trying and eventually you will say good-bye to the diaper forever.
3,Just okay,"I love the illustrations, but I hardly ever read it to my daughter. I found that it spent too much of the book conveying a message that it is okay to have accidents. I didn't want to confuse my child by telling her that when I wanted her to do her best not to have any. This was not my favorite Katz book."
2,could be improved,"I like that the child in this book seems to be gender neutral so it could be used for children of different genders. What I don't like about this book is that it seems to undermine the process of going to the potty by repeating the message that 'i don't think i can go now' or 'i don't feel like it' [paraphrasing, not direct quotes]. the kids also seem to find this minimally interesting compared with the sesame street potty book."
2,Not so great...,"My almost-two year old son absolutely loves this book. He loves the illustrations, the flaps, etc. He has also already shown interest in going to the bathroom on the toilet and has gone ""#1"" and #2"" quite a few times - although we are not actively potty training him or trying to get him out of his diapers (he's a bit early for that). (Note: I don't think his early interest in the potty has anything to do with the book.)I, on the other hand, am not too crazy about the actual story. The rhyming is a bit abrupt in some places and almost forced. I also think the story focuses too much on the obstacles. Of course, toddlers aren't going to be potty trained the first time they sit on their potty. However, I think that spending so much of the book focusing on the struggles is a bit confusing for little ones."
2,Just okay,"This book is just ok. My 21 month old doesn't seem very interested in it even though I thought she would love the super cool flaps. I'm not really crazy about the story line either. I really wish it was more straight forward with actually going on the potty. It does the job though and gets them thinking about the potty, but it is not ideal to me."
3,Pages Rip Out Easy!,I wish this book was hardbound! The pages riped out easy and you then didn't know what page when with what!
2,Not a fan and neither is my daughter,I completely agree with other reviewers that this book is contradictory and confusing. Another factor that will facilitate my donating this book to the local library is that my daughter runs the other way when I break this book out. She is completely bored by it.The Elmo potty training book is having more success.
4,"Great illustrations, very good at grabbing the child's attention","I purchased this book because because of the illustrations and the message of the book. I browsed through several potty training books before I selected this one. One reason I chose this book was that the small child in the illustrations could either be a boy or a girl (meaning that I can use this book with subsequent children). Also, the poetry used in the book can be read in a sing-song voice that my child loves to hear. I also like the words used in the poetry, because I can easily modify them to reduce the negative message that is on some of the pages. In the beginning, I read the story word for word, so my little one would know that it's normal and okay to not succeed at using the potty at first. I also wanted her to realize that it is important to keep trying until she succeeds. Now that she has had a few months worth of successfully using the potty, I hope to find another potty book that continues where this book leaves off."
4,I son absolutely loves it!!,I bought several potty training theme books (some with sound) for my two year old recently and out of all of them this is the one he can't get enough of. I'm sure anyone can agree with me that it can be extremely difficult to get a child to sit more than a minute on a potty/toilet and even that much more difficult to get them through an entire story. But with this book my son wants me to read it over and over to him...to the point that I have it memorized already...LOL. He knows some of the words already and its gots him more interested with willing going to the bathroom and sitting on his potty by himself. I highly recommend getting this for your child.
4,A fun potty book,Bought this book because I like Karen Katz's illustrations (as does my 2 year old). The book is cute and she likes to read it either with or without me. It's a well structured introduction to the potty concept.
5,Cute and engaging,"We are trying to potty train, but with little success thus far. I got this book to try to find a fun way to get my daughter interested in going to the potty. The book has bright, cute illustrations. The content is relevant to her perspective of potty training. She really enjoys reading the book and wants to read it over and over again. It has definitely sparked her interest and she is asking to at least sit on the potty, and we have had a few successes since then."
5,Taught my autistic son how to use the potty,My son has autism and this was one of his favority books at 2 1/2 years old. We read it every night. One day I brought home his very own potty just like in the book and he was so excited. He sat on it right away! He started using the big potty by age 3 yrs old which is really great for a child with special needs! I highly recommend it and just order Karen's Dos and Don'ts for him today.
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this book for my son who was showing interest in the potty but hadn't committed. We read this book a few time and he was so excited for the little girl in the book that he gave her high-fives at the end. After about a week, he was going on the potty without accidents! Would recommend to anyone who has a little one that won't quite commit."
2,"My daugher loves it, but.....","We have a lot of other Karen Katz Lift-the-Flap books, so when I started shopping for a potty book, this one was a natural. If my daughter were writing this review, she would give it 5 stars. She LOVES it. And therein lies the problem. She is totally obsessed with this book and wants us to read it to her at least 10 times a day. This book is SO ANNOYING that I can barely tolerate it. The grammar is bad ('Me and bunny sit awhile'....how 'bout 'Bunny and I?!'), the meter is uneven, and some of the rhymes are just terrible (who rhymes 'together' with 'water?'). I am a stickler for grammar and this kind of thing just drives me nuts. The other Karen Katz books don't have these problems, so I'm not sure what happened here. My recommendation is to preview children's books in person before buying them and make sure that you won't find the book too annoying after the 1000th reading. You never know what stupid thing is going to become your kid's next obsession."
2,Not thrilled,"I was disappointed by primitive language. For example, the sentence ""It kind of feels OK"" does not seem appropriate, especially not in a book for toddlers."
5,Great intro to potty training.,"My daughter is 15 months and loves Karen Katz books, especially this one. I highly recommend it to parents that are beginning the potty training process."
3,My daughter likes it but . . .,"I'm giving this book 3 stars because my daughter has always loved Karen Katz books and this one is no exception. She also shows interest in using the potty after we read it. However. I feel like the book is confusing to her and sends a mixed message because it spends so many pages talking about how the child in the story has no interest in the potty or tries to use the potty unsuccessfully before she finally has success. Once. I realize that those aspects happen in real life but I think it's too much for a 2-year-old to follow along with the concept. She needs a more simple, clear message: sit on the potty, use it, hooray!"
3,"Excellent concept, but horrible grammar!","After reading the reviews, we ordered this book for our two-year-old daughter. When it came, I paged through it and was horrified to see a sentence beginning ""Me and bunny sit awhile""! I'm no stickler for grammar, but why reinforce such an ignorant-sounding error as this in a children's book? Kids at that age unconsciously absorb grammar and syntax from the examples they encounter. In this world of text-speak and functionally illiterate high-school graduates, I'm disappointed that Ms. Katz chose to model poor grammar skills this way."
2,Potty book,The Content did not seem appealing and for some reason my daughter couldn't relate to it.
1,A Potty for Me.,This book is a disappointment. The little girl throughout the book doesn't want to use her potty and at the end she finally does. The one incident the little girl is magically potty trained. The book is unrealistic and unsupportive for a toddler. The only plus to the book is the great illustrations and colorful pictures.
4,Great Book!,This book really did wonders for potty traiing my daughter! She really loved this book and still reads it to this day even after being potty trained for several months!
2,There are better books,"""I want to run and play.""""Uh-oh, I peed in my pants.""Is this a book that you want your child to read and learn about potty? We read the book few times and my daughter loves the life-the-flap part but it's not teaching her about potty at all. It's suggesting that running away and peeing in pants is part of the process. My daughter and I like Once Upon a Potty better than this one. There are better potty training books out there."
3,"Not impressed, like my other Karen Katz better","This is one of the 2 first Karen Katz books I got and I was rather disappointed, after reading so many raving reviews, I expected more. I find the pictures a little oversized for the page - she closes up on the child on the potty so much, that I am not sure my daughter always understands that the baby is actually on the potty, which kind of defeats the purpose. Also, the text feels a little awkward - it sorta rhymes, but just when you get into it, it stops rhyming.It also failed to produce the miracle - my daughter still is not interested in potty. :-) But I guess I won't hold that against Karen Katz.But mostly, it's the reading value - of the 4 books purchased, including Karen Katz's Counting Kisses, my daughter reaches for this one the least often, although it was the most expensive book."
2,Not so good,"I thought this book would be good since the reviews were good but I don't like it. It does rhyme and that's good but it has too many negatives in the wording. Instead of encouraging use of the potty it talks about not being ready and not wanting to go. That is the opposite messaage I want from a potty book. It doesn't describe what the potty is for or get you excited to use it at all. Then it jumps to playing outside and wetting your pants. Then jumps to bedtime and wearing a diaper which I found confusing. I think it could do a better job of explaining the process and why we need to go in the potty and not our pants. It also could explain the other aspects of potty training better, such as wearing underwear, wiping, flushing, hand washing etc.., Overall I would not recommend this book."
4,good book,"Just not for little ones, maybe a 4 yr old my 2 yr old ripped it to pieces in front of me. :( But was cute to read."
4,Cute,"My 19 month old son loves when I read this book to him. The only thing I dislike is that the little kid pees their pants and mommy says ""that's ok"". I feel like it may give a mixed message. We'll see how it goes now that potty training is in full effect!"
4,Potty training,"Cute little book, wrote as a ryhme which little ones love. I read in the description that this was a flip book, I suppose that is what you could call it, however not what I've seen in other flip books, this book ""flip"" is everyother page and the whole page folds out to show three pages. Thats ok, just not what I felt the description said."
1,I don't recommend this book,"The story/plot is good; but that doesn't overcome the construction of the book itself. The pages are the thickness of cardstock. This book lasted one week before my 2 year old son tore a page out. The flaps are not your typical ""lift the flap"". Rather, the pages fold out (think magazine centerfold). My son likes the fold out feature; but again, it's just not durable enough for a toddler who is anxious to flip through the book. Also, the flaps aren't cut to the proper size; so when they are folded back into the book, if not placed perfectly, the book gets ""bound up"". I recommend you get a sturdy board book. Skip this one."
2,There are MUCH better books avaliable!,"When I first brought this book home for my daughter, she liked it. The pictures are simple and the text is pretty straightforward. Two days later, it was already gathering dust, and my daughter reads most of her books until even our neighbors have them memorized! There are SO many potty books avaliable, and this one just isn't up to par. I obviously saw some value to it, I bought it; but this book lacks ""substance"". I know what you're thinking, ""it's a toddler book about going potty"", but this book reads like assembly instructions and even I can't tell if the main character is a girl or a boy. ""My Big Girl Potty"" by Joanna Cole is a FAR better book, and I believe that there is also a version for boys. The story actually makes my daughter want to go on the potty, or at least give it a try. If you want to buy a book to help your child with potty training, I recommend not spending your hard-earned money on ""A Potty For Me:A Lift-the-Flap Instruction Manual""."
1,Odd little book,"We were so excited to see that Karen Katz had written a ""potty"" book as my daughter and I adore all her other books, but once it arrived I was really disappointed. It seems as though it was written in an afternoon. The rhymes are awkward, and the grammar is really really poor. Plus, it's not a Lift-the-Flap it's more of of open the page...really really odd."
3,flap failure,"I'm unhappy with the flap design on this book. The flaps are a full page in size. That doesn't work for toddler's hands. They can't get the flap fully closed before turning the page, resulting in creases & folds in the flaps. Our book is less than a year old & it just hasn't held up like other lift-the-flap books."
4,For Moments like these,"I really enjoy these fine modern semi-minimal String Quartet pieces from Micheal Nyman. The 2nd Quartet ranges from the fast pace & danceable 1st moment to the slow & beautiful 3rd movement which almost brings tears to my eyes. I agree with the other review in regards on the 1st Quartet, this was on the boring side. But after years of being a Phillip Glass fan (Einstein of the Beach & Koyanisqatsi) before he made it famous & now just writes carbon copies of a certain single sad rift (Naqoyqatsi), Micheal Nyman does a better job (The Piano & Songbook with Ute Lemper) & only once did I not like a CD (6 Days 6 Nights). Micheal Nyman explores more emotions & has a more expansive instrumentation than Phillip Glass. Do listen to the samples in the Window Media & Real One Players, they focus on the best part of the CD, & if you like them, the 2nd Quartet is worth the price of the whole CD."
1,Unbearably dull,"I bought this CD with an open mind, and very little exposure to Nyman's music. After listening to it twice, I began to fear that prolonged exposure to this music would cause higher brain functions to cease permanently. I put the CD back on the rack, where it gathers dust to this very day.With some satisfaction, I see that the novelty of Nyman's music has worn off. No wonder --- everyone who liked his music must be in a coma by now.This music is mind-numbingly repetitive and not particularly original. I suspect that Nyman wants to be Philip Glass in the worst way...and he may very well have succeeded. He does indeed appear to be Philip Glass in the worst way."
1,What a Shame!,"As a lover of good accapella music, I wish I could report that this is one of this groups best albums but I must be honest. This is a waste of good talent. I am very sorry to see the decline of this former powerhouse sextet. They just seem to have lost focus on what was so important and what made them famous in the first place. They just don't sing like they use to.Don't waste your money here. If you want great music by Take 6, please buy their first album or even their second album. After that every album gets worse and worse. I really hate saying that because Take 6 was one of the best accapella groups I'd ever heard. This won't make your Christmas very merry!"
2,Exactly who did the author have in mind?,"The best puzzle books start with problems that are interesting and non trivial, and offer unexpected solutions. They appeal to a crowd with different levels of education and offer a new idea or two to all. They will lead an unsuspecting layman to a new beautiful mathematical subject, and treat a pro with a lighthearted yet technically sound look at the concepts he is already familiar with.""Dueling idiots"" is none of that. To read it you must be more than familiar with probability theory, and at ease with going through rather tedious calculations and using mathlab. Yet all a sophisticated reader finds here is technical sloppiness and absence of fresh ideas.I am giving it two stars rather than one because it could provide some probability theory buff with a nice set of ""real life"" applications -- good as an auxiliary text book for an undergraduate probability class e.g. Apart from that, you will find a better puzzle book almost anywhere you look."
2,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Real Irish?","I don't really know, but the Irish in my family and those I consider freinds generally don't listen to traditional tunes played by soloists one after another, after another, after another, ... One single pipe or fiddle can wear on , yet 3, 4 , and\or 5 players harpering out while ya all get a jigg'n and drink'n - thats the Irish Christmas I've come to know.

4,Endangered Cuteness,I got this to go with a recycled bag from the proyecto titi save the tamarins project for a gift. The stuffed animal is very cute and a nice size. It has educational value if you explain to the recipient the importance of protecting animal habitats.
2,Not bad but not really worth the price,"The Networking Essentials Flashcards is a nice little resource to have, especially the poster-size crib-sheet, but it's not really worth the money.Buy a stack of white, index cards at the drugstore for $1.50, and make up your own set of flashcards. You can include more detail, and searching for the information yourself will allow you to remember it better."
5,Bach Preludes and Fuges,"As a young organ student, I enjoyed the basic challenge and ease of reading the clean print in this fine manuscript."
3,Excellent but ...,"Good Dover publications. But beware. It is NOT complete. I bought this book mainly for one Prelude, BWV 552, E-flat Major, ""St. Anne"" and that one is not in there. It gives a reason for it but I find the word ""Complete"" very mis-leading."
5,The Most Involved Musical Artists Ever...,"This band, Earth To Andy, shows so much amazing talent with their CD Chronicle Kings. Their CD is so well balanced for the perfect musical experience possible. They have slow ballads and hard hitting rock songs that are astonishing to listen to. This band should be heard!!!!!!"
5,staind fans...,"ugh, anyone that is a fan of staind should not write a reveiw of a real band. Sorry buddy, you are a joke, staind sucks...you obviously are deaf or suffer from some sort of brain defecit because no one with mild intelligence could possibly think that negative toward Earth To Andy, simple as that."
1,Falling Short,"I saw this band in Memphis, TN back in Dec of 1999. They were absolutely horrible. They had no sense of crowd appeasement, and there sound was just not one that rocked. They didn't perform up to the expectations, and were in the shadows of Simon Says, Chevelle, and Staind. They finished their set, while being booed the entire time If you want to spend your money, get CD's from the above."
5,Earth To ANdy shall Rule The World!!!!!,"The band, Earth To Andy, is the ""greatest contribution to rock music today"" as Rob DeLeo Of Stone Temple Pilots puts it. They ROCK! There is no other band that has what Earth To Andy has. This band will be at the top of the charts!"
5,"The greatest contribution to rock music, EVER",Earth To Andy is the greatest band ever! There songs are extremely well written and they have got the most talent as a rock band. They have amazing harmonies and their guitar riffs are so strong and intimidating. Their music offers so much more than anything else out in the world and they will soon be on top of the world!
5,Sad they were never discovered,"This is by far the best band to never have been discovered. It's sad actually that such a great band with awesome harmonies and a kick ass sound didn't make it when so many other crappy bands did. This album is fantasic from beginning to end, every song could have been a hit if it had ever made it to the radio. They were even better in concernt. I saw them many times in DC in the late 90's and they rocked the house. Miss them. Buy this album you won't be disappointed."
1,Bad product,"When I used the product the first time, a hole in the sleeve had made when I dressed with this."
1,"OK, not really worth it","I'm not sure what I was expecting with a 3-ingredient cookbook, but I found that many of the recipes included prepared ingredients (i.e., a jar of Cheez Whiz, or a packet of onion soup) in order to stay within a three-ingredient total. Again, this is to be expected when you are only ""allowed"" 3 ingredients, but I probably will never use the cookbook. I should have bought a 5-ingredient book!"
5,Truly works!,"How can anyone go wrong with 3 ingredients? Food tastes good! Very basic but yet, it delivers flavorful dishes each time."
1,Great movie but not this!,"Was really looking forward to watching this classic. BUT- this dvd version was unwatchable. I had to turn it off after 15 minutes of ""trying"". The audio was extremely poor. Scratching sounds. Sounded like a movie projector was running in the background- or lawn mower. The image was blurry and opaque. Hardly any color. I would return it but not worth the trouble for $4.99. But would still love to see the film ( key word- ""see"" )."
2,death scream,The dv's cover was in good shape. The itself played really crappy. It seemed to skip and stuff. Played another dvd and it played great. Will most likely steer away from this seller in the future.
4,Why I Ate Glop As A Kid,"Great book for foodies & those interested in the history of feminist pursuits. Shapiro gently tells the history of the missionary types who carved out a professional niche in the gastronomic world with an occasional well placed needle at the woolier aberations produced by the drive to tell the rest of us what was good for us. And, for the most part, as a nation, we swallowed it whole."
3,Good entry level Apple but weak graphics,"This is a good entry level system, though the graphics are sub-par. Don't even think of buying anything less powerful than this system or you will be upgrading next year.I really suggest trying to get a 2GHz G5, but 1.8 is good enough if you are on a budget. 512M of RAM is good and the HDD has plenty of room. However the graphics are disappointing: 64MB GF5200?? That's a value graphics card! 128MB GF5600 is the *least* you should go with (if you ever hope to play Doom3)."
4,apple G 5,not having owned a G 5 but only drowled over my mac. addict magazine my question is why is the line of G 5 's rated lower than one of your featered G 3's ?
2,Below expectations,"Yes, It works better than a G4 but it is heavy and HUGE. I had great expectations but am sorely disappointed. I am now using one at work and the 10.3.3 finder is still a dirty dog. Slow and clunky. Problems with sleep and shutdown. Crashes with Quark. And the font issues are disgusting!Photoshop still runs 5x faster on my Dell M60 Laptop workstation with 2 gigs of ram and 128 meg video card."
2,The G5 does not support Virtual PC,"The G5 does not support Virtual PC. If you want to run dual operating systems, do not buy this computer! Now I'm stuck running two computers!"
1,An Overpriced Computer with Deceptive Advertising,"You will pay for two processors yet it works as if it had only one because 90% of mac software doesn't recognize a dual. Maya runs on only one processor also. For the price of a G5 you can buy four new Pentium computers each running twice as fast with monitor and printer included. On the other hand Macs are cute and reliable, only the pricing is absurd. However, in a few months Apple plans to announce a huge price drop. Wait until then and you will get a much better deal."
1,not the speed demon they claim it to be,"I am a 3D animator and modeler. I run a number of high end programs and have had a chance to produce product on the PC,MAC and SGI. The mac is not as fast as the SGI or a PC with an AMD 64 bit cpu. The operating system on the SGI is much more stable than the MAC.I have good luck with AMD running Mandrake 64 bit operating system. I would not purchase another MAC."
5,What a superb computer!,"Buy this computer! It's simply superb in so many ways that a Wintel box isn't. I use both, but the excellence of this product is of a different order. And Amazon.com's price is the best around, as far as I can tell."
4,Excellent NBC defense reference manual - without the hype!,"Recents news reports of a possible nuclear ""dirty bomb"" threat as well as the ongoing biological warfare threat caused me to buy this book. I looked at the others, but this one definitely has less hype and comes from a knowledgeable source - the US Military! I found the information very easy to understand and practical. Especially good sections are on NBC contamination avoidance; especially the sections on how to decontaminate food and water and the minimum equipment and advance preparation requirements to ensure that you and your family are protected in case of disaster. The sections on biological and chemical contamination are enlightening and make me understand the risk areas I need to be concerned about. This book gives good insight on how the army conducts chemical and bio-defense. An overall worthy reference book to add to my ""survival and defense"" library."
1,"the word is ""lousy""","I had a good feather duster a few years back, but I no longer have it, and now that I own some fragile items, I wanted a new duster to keep them clean. From the moment I lifted this feather duster out of its packaging, it dropped small bits of feathers. It keeps dropping them everywhere it's carried. You can't use this to clean; it leaves more behind than it picks up. At this cheap price, it's not worth my time re-packing and sending back, but it's useless. I'll be throwing it out. Save your time and money and buy a better duster. If they had a ""zero star"" option I'd use it."
3,"Not fluffy, but does an adequate job.","I gave it 3 stars due to preference, not necessarily performance. I was looking for a smaller fluffy ostrich feather duster. This one was medium sized, but not fluffy. The feathers were on the stiffer side and the overall shape is more conical. It still did dust fairly well,but due to the stiffness, moved some lighter objects around instead of dusting them.I found the fluffy one here:Ostrich Feather Duster - 13"" LongI hope this helps someone else get what they want, whether it be this or something else."
5,Dust,"feather duster, what els can i say other than it dusted ..lol adding this jibberish cause i have to enter a minimum amout of words before i can hit submit"
1,Do we make anything in the USA anymore???,"Oh my...I have used this feather duster twice and it has lost most of the feathers on one side. Looks like a plucked chicken...sad. I couldn't believe it when huge feathers started dropping has I was going over glassware that I have to be very gentle with. There probably would be nothing but the handle left if I actually used it on everything. I've been cleaning in one house or another since I was pretty young...I do not remember this happening to my Mother's dusters.I'll throw this one out and continue my search for a GOOD feather duster, but I'm afraid it's futile."
3,Comments on duster.,construction of duster was somewhat sloppy. feathers were a little stiffer than i expected. after small amount of used feathers began to break up.
3,it's a start,"this is a really intended to introduce one who doesn't even know what a producer or does to the basic job functions. as a producer, i found it a little be text book'ish. a producer really needs to learn more about business in general and the politics of film making.dark arts productions"
4,Lawrence Turman's Book So you want to be a producer,This is a very informative book. I just bought it here and I think that it is a MUST have! Thanks Mr. Turman for giving us more insight on being a producer. This is an excellent book and I like your honesty and your enthusiasm for the craft. This book has inspired me.
2,Book in poor condition,I ordered this book to replace the same one that I had passed on to a friend. The book I received looks like coffee has been spilled all over the cover and down the side. Not acceptable!! this was supposed to be a NEW book!! I would return it if I didn't need it now and am not able to find it locally.
1,Over priced junk.,Want lots of wires? Like gimmicky flashers? Need another remote to lose? Then this kit is for you. The pods are not sealed properly and eventually 3 of the eight just quit. 2 others were flickering to their deaths.Ripped this system out from under my Jeep and bought 4 walmart special lights to go on all four corners. Much better.
3,Inspirational flower photographs,"The book contains (very) good pictures of flowers. The subtitle (Inspiration, Equipment and Technique) is a little misleading since only the basics of Equipment and Technique are covered. These basics are covered in clear text and good pictures. Examples of use of color are good.The inspiration part of this book is good since the book contains a lot of beautiful pictures which take you off the beaten track."
4,I liked it,"It is well recorded, the choir sounds deep and full of feeling, and the soloist are very pleasant. I will compare to other versions and I may change my opinion, but for now, I would recommend it."
1,Total ripoff,"This is a piece of fluff, worth about 5 cents. I clicked on it, thinking it was a bargain cd. It was -- for amazon."
4,A close look at hard lives,"As usual, Gissing is unsparing in his depiction of the lives of the working class. Some of the characters are not wholly convincing - especially the key character Ida, the former prostitute with a heart of gold, and Maud, the pure and self-denying - and there are maybe a few too many subplots, but on the whole, the characters, male and female, are interesting and believable, and the difficult choices that they face are plausible and engrossing. Well worth a look for those who have read New Grub Street and The Odd Women and want more Gissing."
5,Great book,"This book is very helpful, encouraging, motivating, and informative. Joe is very personable and welcomes contact on his book regarding fitness questions. It's a keeper."
4,Average,"These came in the mail, you can tell brand new. I got black which I didn't really like, but not a big deal. Shipped decently fast, too. Worth the money I would say."
4,just your typical tanning goggles..,"I was a little disappointed to receive them in red but that's a minor detail. They do the job, nothing fancy.. but that's all I really needed."
4,sunlamp goggles,"Placing order was easy. The goggles arrived as projected, fast. The quality and cost was excellent. The advertisement and order through Amazon was accurate and easy."
5,Inexpensive,"I lost my old pair of tanning googles and needed a replacement. I use a booth not a bed so the googles needed a strap to hold them on and most eye protection these days are for beds so they don't include the headband to hold them on while standing. These are almost identical to the old pair I had. These would work great in a bed as well, just remember to not place the headband in the same place everytime you tan and you won't get the strap tanlines."
2,cheaply made,The item arrived promptly but I have been disappointed in the quality. The connection point in the plastic where the elastic hooks in is not shaped correctly and the elastic will not stay secure.
5,Saves my eyes,"Goggles arrived quickly, in good condition and exactly as advertised. Fits my eyes perfectly and comfortably. I received a red pair."
5,Walking With Angels,"This is a well written book and very interesting reading. The stories are about encounters with angels. They are all true stories and in each case the person was drawn closer to Jesus as a result. They confirm the fact that we have guardian angels and they are real. If you want your faith strengthened, this is a book that will do that. This book was purchased through Amazon - a great place to find great books!!!"
4,Wish it was cable ready,I have this tv hooked up to my DVD player and my Panasonic shelf sound system at work. Not too bad of a set up. The color is rich and bright. I don't know how well it can get tv stations but that's fine by me since I only use it as a monitor anyway. Where I live tvs can't really work unless you have cable or a dish. Otherwise it's a nice investment for a micro theater system. If it was cable ready it would get five stars.
1,What is 84 channel VTS Tuning?,"This is not a review. I would like to know what this 84 channel VTS tuning means, in other words , can it be connected to cable tv and get a substantial amount of stations, or will it still just get 13 misc. channels? Thanks."
2,Use a band-aid instead,"I was turned off from the outset by this book's suggestion that the author's version of spirituality and morality was the ""right"" one, and everyone else was off the mark somehow. Then the advice itself was less than helpful."
5,"Well Written, Common sense for parents","I was brought(in the European orthodox Jewish tradition ) up to respect my elders, as well as others. How refreshing to read a guide that lets us be parents (as opposed to buddies) with our kids. I enjoyed telling my 'old fashioned' parents that a up to date psychologist agrees with their way of parenting!! This book helps you see that you can be a good friend and guide to your kids without letting them become the boss. While I would not use this book as a source for Jewish theology (or law), Mogel does a beautiful job of using Jewish sources to help all parents with universal parenting issues. Thank you Dr Mogel!!"
5,"Phenomenal book on parenting, whether you're Jewish, Muslim, Christian or an Athiest, this book is a must read!","I bought this book based on an article I read in The Atlantic called ""How to Land Your Kids in Therapy"", the journalist interviewed Dr. Wendy Mogul and just from a few quotes from her book mentioned in the article I had to get it. I love the way she combines age old traditional parenting with clinical proof and expertise. The advice she gives can help any parent, of any religion get back to the basics of being authority figures in our children's lives, instead of grown up ""friends"". Our children don't need us to be their friends, they need and want us to be their parents, and this book is a great reminder of how we can retain a harmonious ""balance of power"" in our homes, and raise children who are equipped for the real world when they come of age and move out. I am giving this book to every parent I know, it is that important!"
5,Wonderful book,"If you want to get some very good advice on how to guide your children without using threats, this is an excellent way to incorporate wise and patient advice in a practical manner. I'm not Jewish, but my wife and my children are, and even though you do not have to adhere to a religious method, I find that the guidance provided by the philosophy behind Judaism is extremely helpful in keeping me calm and in providing my boys an excellent framework to deal with issues when I, or their mother, is not present.An easy read full of easily implemented ideas.I highly recommend this book."
5,Love the book,"Good teaching about compassionate discipline, raising children--- --- --- --- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -"
5,wonderful classic,"Unfortunately, the person I bought this book for already had it. She raved about the book so I read parts of it. I found it practical and interesting. I am a grandparent now and I wish this book would have been publised when I was a young father."
4,A well-written parenting handbook,"As parenting handbooks go, this one is well-written, entertaining, and consistent with our 3 years of parenting experience. On the other hand, it really is more of a survival guide and doesn't provide any insight on how to take parenting to the next level, i.e. how to get to know and bring out the potential of each child; which is what truly makes parenting rewarding. I suspect that this author is capable of discussing all that but perhaps in another book with a larger page count. Enjoy!"
5,the BEST parenting book!,"Whether you're Jewish or not, this book is by far the best book on parenting I have come across. The wisdom of the tradition and the collected experiences of parents struggling to raise self-reliant emotionally intelligent children are a fascinating combination. I urge you to not only read it but to re-read it and then share it with all your friends with kids.:) Marla, mom and Jewish educator"
5,Excellent Book,Every parent should read this book regardless of their religion. The principles in the book are useful for all.
5,It's a good book - read it.,"I would recommend this book to any parent who is experiencing trouble with overprotected and/or overindulged children. Though I am myself not Jewish I liked how the author - based on Jewish beliefs - reassured parents that it is ok to set limits and ask your children to pay you the due respect. Afterall, you are supposed to be your child's parent and not his/her friend! Parenting is not about pampering or protecting but about preparing for life. Even from a non-religious point of view the book made some good points; a lot of the other suggestions made in the book were pretty much common sense but I guess that also depends where you come from. What I liked most about it though was that it encouraged parents to accept that a kid might just be ""normal"" and it is somtimes more important to accept that than to try to turn your child into something it is not (read: a genius). It's a good book - read it."
5,The Blessings of a Great Book,"Raising a healthy family in today's world is challenging for even the most insightful of parents. The Blessings of a Skinned Knee provides psychological and spiritual wisdom as well as practical guidance and parenting skills to enable every parent to succeed in creating a healthy and happy home. This book belongs on every parent's nightstand!Amy Hirshberg Lederman [...], author of ""To Life! Jewish Reflections on Everyday Living"" and ""One God, Many Paths: Finding Meaning and Inspiration in Jewish Teachings."""
5,Bursting with information!,"If you want to learn 'heavy' jazz drumming, this is the book to get. Completely loaded with advanced drumming lessons. I have always wondered how drummers arrived at the 'random' comping I have heard in so many jazz recordings.....its all explained here! This book will keep you busy for a long, long time."
5,Pure Ecstacy,"If you are a fan of the Global Underground Series...or just deep bass lines and smooth transistions which make you want to move your body...then look no further! Nick Warren blends progressive beats...rythmic vocals...and a trance background which flows thoughout both discs! Just a pure energetic release of music which makes you want to turn the volume up so loud everyone around you can enjoy! Perfect for driving fast or living even faster...if you like the Global Underground series then you will not be dissapointed with this disk! Forget the beaches off the coast of Ibiza...or the view from the Golden Gate bridge...after hearing these disks...you will wish you were in, of all places...Budapest!"
2,Try Again,"I don't like this cd, it's that simple. I was very excited to listen to it when i first got it. To be honest I was expecting a lot. I really enjoy the line of music glogal underground has been puting out. However, this cd reminds of the goa trance I have from 4 years ago. If you want some real music go and get Oaknefold's Resident, Seb Fontaine's Prototype, or Gatecrasher Wet. I could think of 20 cd's I would listen to before ever putting this one in my radion again. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there is very little that is good about it."
2,NOT WORTH IT!,"I was vey exited on gettin this CD; however i have to say i was extremely dessapointed when i got it. It is just a little bit too repetitive, especially the 1st cd which abslotely sucks. The 2nd Cd is not bad, especially songs 5-6-7, which are the only reason for what i steal listen to this cd every now and then. So just dont waist the money cause there are more than 30 cds better than this one out there"
2,Dis CD no good,"Nick Warren just needs to give it up; there will be no Global Underground in Budapest; mainly because their people are far TOO WEAK! The real global underground shall take place in Pakistan, and soon after we shall RULE THE WORLD!! HAHAHAHA!!"
4,"Tight screw-off bottom, good otherwise","Great look and feels very real. The screw cap on bottom is a little difficult to get off, tried WD40 with little luck, next will try Vaseline. But overall happy with it."
4,Music of chaos and complexity,"I was turned on to Michael Torke's music when I saw the San Francisco Ballet dance to several numbers from this CD. Ash is my favorite. I can still close my eyes and see the complex interweavings of form and chaos that the dancers so beautifully performed. But it was the music that captured my imagination. It spoke to me of the complexity of our times. I listen to this CD often. Unfortunately, the SF Ballet company does not sell videos of their works."
3,Check it out,"Having played Ecstatic Orange myself was what originally led me to buy this CD. The music may seem rather repetitive and perhaps even annoying after a while (you may even wonder if the composer was drunk or something), but one should keep an open mind. It does have structure and it does make sense if you care to listen. Baltimore plays it quite well, but I can understand why some may not like it. Just remember nobody especially liked Mahler or Stravinsky when their pieces first appeared either. Whether Torke will someday be considered a composer in the ranks of Beethoven or Shostakovich is completely impossible to say, but if you have an interest in something a bit different, go ahead and check this disc out."
3,"Nothing to Hear Here, Folks, except at the End","The focus of the reviews here is of course the music itself rather than the performances, which I don't think can really be faulted. And for me and my untrained ears, the sad conclusion is that the only piece of any real value is the last, Bright Blue Music. The least minimalist -- sounds like a double negative -- work on the album, it actually speaks in almost conventional, traditional idiom and goes somewhere emotionally, a trait not particularly shared by its companions, which pretty much just run in place and suffer their own musical analogue to Tourette Syndrome, never fulfilling the promise of their beginnings. That being the case, I don't know that it's worth it to buy a disc for just nine minutes of music, or to sit through almost two-thirds of an hour to finally reach it at the end. Well, actually, I think I do know: It's not."
3,New Music for Steven Bochko to love,"What would Michael Torke do if he ever lost his score for Stravinsky's Symphony In C ? He wouldn't have anything to spice up the Bernstein-ism's with ! But the little Mike Post cadences would still save the day... Eat your spinach, dear ! I say it's Academic Minimalism, and I say the Hell with it! It just proves again, if proof were really needed, that any Avant Garde movement carries the seeds of its own decadence within itself from its inception. Those who find this ""listenable Minimalism"" should be locked in a room with a recording of The Well Tuned Piano on eternal repeat. Philosophical question: does repeating some cleverly orchestrated trifle in a flaccid loop make that trifle ""minimalist"" ?"
2,rock minimalism,"The thing about Torke is that he ""tries too hard to get people to like him."" Furthermore, his rationale, albeit honest in his intentions of departing from academic views, on composing vernacular polyglot works is superficial and artistically light-weighted."
4,Brewing Strong,"Pros: This burner will boil seven gallons in a hurry! Perfect for home brewing. Could probably do 10 gallon batches with this.Cons: The nice, slick looking black paint will burn off the entire upper surface within the first couple times using it, leaving only soot-covered bare metal.Overall: 4/5. Extreme value: best you'll get for the money."
5,Great burner,Originally bought the Brinkman turkey fryer kit at Home Depot. The thermal coupling lasted for two cooking sessions. I purchased the Bayou Classic which doesn't have a thermal coupling. As long as you're watching your oil temperature (which you should be!) this unit is the way to go.I even found the regulator and hose assembly for Bayou Classic at Lowes and repaired the original Brinkman so now I have two.
4,works just like it should,"This thing is neat, when adjusted to it's highest, you can feel it from almost 10 feet away. My 18inch pot fits on it perfectly."
4,Great Burner,"We use this burner for home brewing beer. The first boil came twice as fast as my BBQ burner and I didn't have it on full blast. I only gave it 4 stars because of the paint, it burned off within minutes of lighting the flame. Why paint it, if it's going to burn off?Excellent burner for our use."
2,disappointed - Not large enough for my keggle to sit on,"Might be fine for large pots, but not keggles. The round surface fits inside the keg bottom, therefore the keggle does not sit on it properly. Wish I had bought the square one. The square one is 16 x 16."
3,"Decent, but a few drawbacks","Bought this to use for homebrewing out on my back patio. The paint burning off the first few times using it (as others have mentioned) is quite annoying. Not sure how a product gets realized with a known defect like that. As far as the advertised ""wind shield"", I was using it on a day with 25mph wind gusts, and it blew out several times. So that's a pretty ineffective wind shield."
4,Bayou Classic rocks,"Wow! Just gone from electric stove top to this 185000 btu beast, made my first all grain with this baby just insane how quickly this will bring your strike/sparge/wort liquid up to temp. Not sure why they bother to paint this unit, the super heat generated from this beast strips the paint right off, guess for sales purposes it looks neat. Cannot beat the price and for the home brewer this is a must!"
2,Time Wasted,"No directions for assembly are provided. The bag of parts contains a spring which does not appear in the picture on the box but it does not contain two screws which are clearly shown in the picture, and for which there are holes drilled. My call to Amazon got the response that you do not need screws but no suggestion what to do other than return it, with the caveat that a replacement would be the same. After several calls to the company (closed during lunch) they affirmed screws were not necessary and explained how it should be assembled with the spring. In response to the question why did you not put in directions and change the picture they said they did just did not get around to it."
1,regulator is junk,"I used this a few times to make chicken wings, then in less than a year it is rusted and the regulator won't let gas through because of some malfunction on the safety mechanism. It ruined thanksgiving. Nobody open. Nowhere to get replacement."
4,"Great Burner for home Brewing, but watch the paint..","I used this burner last night for the first time with my Home Brew. I thought it worked great, easy to light, control flame, and held a LARGE 10 gallon stock pot very sturdy. The only reason that I deducted a star was becuase the paint on the burner flaked off after it got very hot. This wasn't much of a problem for me as I was in my garage with no wind, but I wouldn't want the paint chips getting into my brew or food I were outside. I would still recommend the burner, but just caution the first time you use it. I assume this wont happen as much now that the paint is gone."
4,My Rocket Burner,They told me that I could launch a rocket with this burner. Well maybe my son will try one day. I use it to brew my beer and it seems to work great when it comes to keeping a constant temp quickly. Wish it had a igniter so that is one drawback to it. So far I'm happy with it.
2,Warning Item Pictured and Described Does Not Exist,"On 12/8/12 I purchased the Bayou Classic as a gift for my father specifically because of the 48"" braided hose and quality valve. Upon inspection of the cooker on 12/11/12, the hose and valve were not as described or pictured online. The box and manual however matched what I was led to believe I was purchasing. When I contacted Bayou Classic on 12/13/12 and requested a replacement hose, they informed me that they don't make a 48"" braided hose nor have they ever. In fact, they had never heard of anyone reporting a complaint for a 48"" braided hose and instructed me to return the product. The End. Bayou Classic has deceived their customers and played them the fool by marketing a product that according to Bayou Classic does not exist. I am very disappointed in this purchase and specifically with Bayou Classic's attitude towards the customer."
3,Decent burner,"I bought this burner for homebrewing, and as for its intended function, it gets a ton of water up to a boil pretty quick, so I'm happy with that. Another bonus is that the burner itself is pretty well shielded from the wind. The downside, as others have mentioned is that the paint burns off the first time you turn it on. This makes me worry about corrosion in the future. Also, the control valve is a little finicky and tough to set exactly where you want it. Decent burner for the money, but definitely not the best I've seen. I'd probably do a little more searching before buying this model again."
4,"Very satisfied, so far.","It's winter here in WA., so, I've only had a chance to use the burner once on my back deck to can some peppers. It worked fine. The paint on the frame near the burner did burn off as others said it would. I don't think that will be a problem. When it gets warmer, I'll get some black fireplace paint, good for high temps., and repaint."
2,not so pleased,not so pleased with this prod. burner does not burn as i thought. next one I buy will be the one on the stand with the holder for the pot
4,this is a monster,"If you want to throw alot of flame on your skillet or pot, this baby will do it. A super simple design. works like a flame thower so it scares me a little but I treat it with respect and it is my favorite outside cooker. You will get a little pop at the air intake valve when you turn it off since the gas bleads back to this point as it shuts down, but I am not really concerned."
4,works great,"Works great for the price.The regulator knob is a bit touchy, but it works fine once set and doesn't change while it runs.The heat is great, boils an 8gal pot of cold water in about 15 min (may have been a little less) outside in 50 degree weather.the paint burn-off like others have said smells like death, but it goes away and then you don't care.I found that the paint burned off faster if I put the pot on it (filled with water so it wouldn't warp).It is loud, but that helps you to not forget it is on as it has no auto shutoff (this is a HUGE requirement for beer making, timers make for bad beer batches).Lighting it is a bit tricky when it on the ground with a pot on top as the access angle is kinda weird, do it twice and you stop caring.Not sure how long it takes to burn up an entire propane tank, but I am sure i used a lot of gas on my 1st batch of beer I made with this.Had to heater water for the mash, then the sparge, then boil the wort."
2,MIssing parts,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my Son-in-law and when the box was opened it was missing the fuel line and propane tank pressure valve and there was no instruction booklet. I was not sure what all was missing with out the booklet. How they could have missed putting these key items in the box, is a puzzle. I was able to go online to Bayou Classic and look up instructions from downloadable booklet. After a couple of days of no response to the company phone line (I assumed they may have been still on a Christmas Break) we were able to reach someone and to their credit, they mailed the missing fuel line out immediately.Jury is still out on how it operates but at least the company came through with the part."
4,Great for brewing beer.,Gets the wort to a rolling boil quickly. Much better than boiling wort inside. Didn't go out even with the wind blowing.
4,Good for brewing beer,I've been using this for 3 years and I like it a lot. I do 5 and 10 gallon brews and this can easily get things to a rolling boil. It also saves time by quickly bringing water to a boil. 15 minutes to get 5 gallons to a boil. If I go full blast I could probably do that in 10 mins. I have used it in the garage with little wind and also in the back yard with gusts but have never had issues with it blowing out.I can chew up propane tanks pretty quickly. Generally I get three 5 gal batches or two 10 gallons batches per tank.
5,Must have this for outdoor cooking.,Love this product that I might buy another one for my daughter and Amazon.com is the place to buy it.
5,Great Gas Cooker,"This is one great cooker,we purchase this cooker over a month ago and we have used it several times without any problems.Durning a family cookout, a family member was so impressed with the performance of this cooker that we purchased one for him. Great Item!!!!!"
2,The hose regulator leaks after 18 months of use,"Pro:High BTU output thus heat up cooking oil quicklySturdy well buildMetal mesh protective hoseCon:Does not accommodate a Wok, which has a round bottomThe red regulator leaks after 18 months of usage"
4,Watch the Paint!,"This thing is great if you were previously trying to boil 7 gallons of liquid on your kitchen stove. At full blast it gets water to a boil in about ten minutes. I think the picture they show is an older version, the new one has a braided gas line. The only bad thing about this is the paint. The first time I used this, I thought the EPA was going to be knocking on my door, all of the paint burns off and the smell is horrible. Even after three uses I still get that smell. Also don't leave it out in the rain. I made that mistake and now its covered in rust since all of the paint burned off. Overall I still recommend it, you can't beat the price and the free shipping."
3,Ignore Previous Reviews,"Yes, It works, but do not read the previous reviews, because you will not be receiving the same product. No, it does not have a wind guard. No it is not even the same cooker as in the enclosed manual. I think it is the ""new and improved"" model!"
1,Very dissapointed,"Got this for home brewing, and it does bring liquid up to a boil very quickly. However, it uses the old style tank connection, so we had to spend $60 on a new propane tank. Even more aggravating is that there is very little heat control. Trying to maintain a 160-degree temp for steeping for a period of time is almost impossible. The day after I used it I saw Target was running an ad for one with a much better temp gauge."
3,"The Bayou Classic SP10 High Pressure Outdoor Gas Cooker, Propane","The Bayou Classic SP10 High Pressure Outdoor Gas Cooker, Propaneis falsely advertised. When you order the picture containes a propane tank attached to it.the above title describes as if the propane comes with it.I could have bought a cheaper one but since i thought that it came with the tank I opt to purchase this one."
1,Not To Happy,Ended up with 2 cookers one I paid pastage and one I didn't. For 185000 BTU it takes 25 min to heat up 7 gal of water. My old 76000BTU did it faster. Did see where I can do something to the needle valve. I tried to stop the second cooker but to no avail.Bruce Jamieson
2,Why the huge price increase?,Last week this burner was $39.99. I put it in my cart to buy later. The next day the price jumped to $59. WTF???
1,Slow delivery,Ordered a simple fry basket more than 2 weeks ago. Still hasn't arrived and no e-mail to tell me why. Tried calling customer service at 8 am and no call back in 4 hours.
5,Perfect!,"this is an awesome product...I don't care about the paint burning off...HELLO its a burner, doesnt need to be pretty...some of these folks reviewing this are like little sissy's I can't even believe it. It does its job, and it does it well. I use it for brewing beer and its gets a 32qt to a boil very fast. The adjustment for the flame doesnt seem to be a problem for me. Works great! awesome price, very strong and stable."
5,It works well!,"Its a high BTU burner that we use in brewing and for shrimp/crab boils. It produces a lot of heat and is controllable with a valve on the gas line. It goes to a fairly low output, but don't expect it to get down as low as a gas burner on your kitchen stove. This is a very large size single burner and down low it is still going to put out a lot of heat, its just the nature of the beast. (Our kitchen stove has two sets burner orifices, one for high one for low.)Some people have complained about the ""paint"" burning off. It looks like powder coating, if its really important to you, spray it with BBQ paint and be done with it. I believe that it would also burn the BBQ paint off as well, its hot!We looked at a number of different brands of high BTU burners and this was a good unit at a good price.The system that we received had everything necessary to hook it up to a tank and start cooking.I would buy it again, from this source."
4,Bayou Classic SP10,"I've only used it 5 times, so it's a little early to be conclusive. But it arrived quickly as advertised, worked great right out of the box, puts out more heat than I'll ever need, and is very portable, yet stable. Everything appears to be very good quality, including the baked enamel paint and the wire-braided hose. I recently noticed that when increasing the flame with the finger valve, that the flame initially gets smaller before getting bigger. This is a sign that the valve may not be consistent, but it hasn't caused any major problems yet. I'd definitely recommend this burner to a friend."
2,Ok product,Gave it 2 stars because it painted black and all the paint flaked off after two uses and is rusting. They should have powder coated it.I also own a stainless steel model and made my own wind guard for it.
4,"Good burner, paint burns off","This is a good burner, it's high pressure, burns with a lot of heat, and boils a pot of water fairly quickly. The black paint on the grill burnt off the first time I used it, though, and it kind of smelled bad. Expect that to happen the first time you use it if you keep the heat up for extended time. Aside from that, though, does everything I would expect it to do."
4,bayou classic sp10,Used it for a clambake and it fired up so quickly. The controls were easy to use and adjusted easily. We had one of our best clambakes ever..
5,Great for BBQs,Used it to steam crabs. It gets a great flame going. Only small issue is it's a little shorter than ones I've used in the past.
5,Really Does the Job,"I did a ""wet"" dry run as soon as I got this burner. I heated 6 gallons of water in a stainless steel 8 gal. brew pot to boiling in 25 minutes. I did this outside with a light breeze blowing. If you open it up, it really roars! The flame is very well protected from the wind. To maintain a steady, rolling boil of 6 gallons of wort, you need only open the valve about a quarter turn. The valve is a bit ""spongy"" feeling and you do have to have a light touch and fiddle with it to get the setting you want. I highly recommend this burner."
4,Now I'm cooking with gas!,"I ordered this burner to use for brewing beer, and maybe the occasional crab boil. The burner itself works great. I can have 7 gallons of water to a rolling boil in a matter of minutes. At extremely high settings, the burner can be quite loud, but at a setting just high enough to maintain a rolling boil, it barely makes any sound at all. My only complaint is that the manual seemed to be for a different model, as nothing even resembling my burner is pictured."
4,Good quality but instructions lacking.,I got this cooker and hooked it up to my LP tank and then I could not get it to stay lit. It would blow out seconds after I got it lit. After going over everything over and over I called the manufacture who told me that the newer versions have additional instructions about limiting the opening of the LP tank valve or the pressure will shut down the cookers safety mechanism. Once I tried(with them on the telephone) no problems. It fires now and cooks like a heck. I would recommend.
2,10 psi regulator,"The unit did come with a 20 psi regulator but now it comes with a 10 psi. The decription has been changed on amazon web site. The fault in the mix up was not Bayou Classic but their supplier. The Supplier used to offer the unit with a 20 and stopped making it and swaped to a 10 psi and never told Bayou Classic. I have tested both and you can not tell a difference.As far as BTU goes, Bayou Classic does not give any of their cookers a BTU rating, there is not an industry standard for testing BTU in the outdoor cooking world."
3,"works well, but painted with non-flame resistant paint...","the unit works well but is painted with paint that will burn off the top half of the burner during first use. Go ahead and buy it, but DON'T cook on it without turning it on for 30 minutes on high to burn off the pain first, or you'll end up with toxic ash in whatever you are cooking."
3,Coating burns off during first use,"Just used this for the first time and the black coating on the iron around the burner burned off during first use creating ashes, smoke, and a foul odor. Why would there be flammable paint on a burner? Other than that, it seems to work well. Boiled water quickly and the three legs made it very stable."
3,Propane burner,The unit works great. The only complaint is the display picture showed a 90 deg. elbow at the burner end but the unit I received does not have that. This does not effect the operation it just does not work as well for my purpose.
1,Missing parts - can't use it,I got the burner yesterday and took it with us to have a crab boil at our RV over the weekend. Disappointed when I opened the box to find that the gas supply line and regulator and other parts were not in the box. Now I had to go out and buy another brand to use for the weekend. Not real happy that I have ask the manufacturer to furnish me the parts that are missing. I bought it from Amazon and I will have to pay return shipping cost.
5,Worked Very Well!,"I bought this to replace an older cooker that had rusted out. Short of the normal thing of the paint burning off after the first use, this cooker worked like a charm to fry a turkey during Thanksgiving 2011."
5,Very nice and efficient,"I have used this cooker a few times for crabs and corn on the cob, it is great! It keeps the kitchen cool and odor free. It boils water very fast without using an extreme amount of gas. You can control the heat output with the regulator. The unit is very sturdy and will accommodate a large pot. The braded steel (Can't tell it is braded hose from pic) hose and regulator would cost you as much as this whole cooker! Just go to a big store or on line and price one, you will see."
2,The design is about as bad as their customer service,"Package arrived intact and in good order. Upon opening I found an empty plastic bag with no parts in it. Tried to contact the mfg, but their instructions were to contact the seller. Got a smart reply in a chat session with them and no instruction to assemble. Used it one time and the paint is peeling off it. I would imagine rusting will occur shortly. Worst experience I have ever had with an Amazon vendor."
3,Content,"This was a pretty good look at the development of the US auto industry. Caution, the book is large and heavy. I found it somewhat difficult to follow the text due to all the photos. Often, by the time I'd looked at the subsequent photos, I'd lost track of the subject matter and would have to flip back for a review (and did I mention the book was large and heavy). This made the book difficult to read seamlessly."
4,go stainless,this prop was a lot better than the 3 blade for hole shot but go stainless. to much flex in aluminum.
4,If only,If only he looked at me i looked at him in a qiuck sudden i was falling in love it happened so fast but it never seem to passIf only i knew the words to say the road to take to find a way to your heart what do i do to get to youi don't wonna be so shy but when i'm alone i wonder why ivy
2,Cryptic,"Cryptic is the word to describe this book. When describing the protocols, the author couldn't decide how in-depth he should go. As a result, what you have is a very unbalanced treatment. Without more details, all the chapters on protocols are totally useless -- unless the reader is already very familiar with them. The author should have written in more detail or omitted the chapters on protocols totally.Very wordy. No illustration. But this seems to be only book on Openswan. What a shame."
2,Inaccurate translation ruins an otherwise outstanding manga...,"Tactics is a very entertaining manga series with well-developed characters and interesting storylines. Unfortunately, ADV's translation of this volume leaves much to be desired. The main problem is that they made a serious error in changing the sex of two of the main characters, sending Tactics fans everywhere into an uproar. There is no excuse for a mistake of this magnitude, so I can only assume that ADV must have done it intentionally, perhaps because one of the characters is a bit androgynous looking.I have all of the original Japanese volumes of Tactics and was looking forward to buying the English translation as well, but I can't support a company that makes such serious translation errors. Nor a company that so blatantly ignores and looks down on its fanbase by assuming that no one would notice such an error."
2,Poorly translated,"This is probably one of the worst translating errors I've seen in a while. Whether is was an accident or intentional, I'm not sure.Two of the reoccuring characters are switched to the other gender. Sugino, the white tengu, is very male, however ADV made Sugino female. Muu is generally considered to be female, most of the characters refer to her as such, but ADV made Muu male.I'm incredibly disappointed and will more than likely buy the original rather than giving ADV my money for a piece of work that doesn't deserve it. I'm very fond of this series and these characters, and am greatly appalled at this massacre of it."
3,Tactics manga: Kindle review!,"By ErinThe Kindle version of this manga is the ADV translation...not the most accurate. In volume 2 the genders of some of the characters are even incorrect! The Tokyopop translation is much better. The artwork, however, is wonderful and if you are a fan of Japanese mythical creatures this is a winner. There is a great translator's notes section included at the end."
3,this book is a journey,"Yes, it is a fascinating trip in which you meet some enigmatic people in extraordinary circumstances. Watson presents a lot of thought provoking events and quirky details. At times it suffers a bit from New Age chic-isms, but if you cut him a bit of slack there, it is one hell of an interesting book."
4,very unique book bridging many ideas and disciplines,I really enjoyed this book because it uses anthropology as a framing mechanism to discuss a host of other questions - namely the implications of quantum physics on life in general.
3,Overrated; good for limited audience only; rating = 6,"Generally good, but overrated. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more if I had read the previous two (Manhattan When I was Young etc.). Did not think there was much flow throughout and Mary Cantwell certainly didn't inspire or go straight to my heart such as Lindbergh's ""Gift From the Sea"". Good if you've got nothing else to read."
1,Real Yaz(oo) fan's won't need this one.....,"This ""best of"", along with the Naked Eyes ""best of"" ( both try to condense two albums into one best of ) should not please any true Yaz fan. If you are a fan of analogue 80's Synthpop then you must own BOTH Yaz albums and the masterful Naked Eyes, self titled as well. Buy the full albums and you won't have to wonder what you missed! You'll make you and me both happy people! :-) Bernie"
2,Terrible Compilation,"Two albums and they couldn't even get things right with selecting the best material. They made the obvious choices of their three best songs, but after that everything is filler. Plus all those annoying remixes. I hate remixes as a rule and these even are worse than the ones I usually avoid. Who compiled this? They should be shot."
2,One hit wonder,"I bought this cd for the first song on it, and it's a great song. But as a whole, this cd is terrible."
3,Yazoo's Best Of Compilation: Good Music Remixed Bad,"I am a diehard fan of Yaz, but this cd failed to reflect all of the great and pure synth pop music this group offered. If you buy it, record it on a blank cd and take it back to the store as a used trade-in. Better yet, forget this production exists and buy yourself the only two releases from this awesome group: ""Upstairs at Eric's"" and ""You and Me Both."" This production would had hit the mark if it had not included the poorly remixed ""Situation"" and ""Don't Go."" Club 69 has the reputation of making wonderful music a disgrace. Todd Terry can make some pretty good remixes, as he did with Everything But The Girl's ""Missing,"" but Yazoo's ""Don't Go"" is a hit by itself with no further handling. For the horrific remixes by Club 69 and Richard Humpty Vission (I can forgive a flaw by Todd Terry)I give this compilation what it deserves: 2 stars. Don't waste your money."
3,"Two albums, 1 maxi single, more rich record companies","If you do not have Upstairs at Erics or You and Me Both, this album is for you. Though the songs presented are masterpieces, the few extra tracks would best be separated to a maxi single as the style is not representative of Yaz (other than the beautiful Only You strings version)."
4,"Good, but where is the missing single?","Overall, this is an excellent collection, albeit incomplete. What happened to the ""missing"" single The Other Side Of Love? It was a top twenty hit, shouldn't it be included here? A what about Happy People-another song never available in the U.S. With the exception of the new version of Only You, the remixes are pointless."
1,DNF did not finish,This book is so boring. I tried my best to at least read half way through but was not able. Think twice before attempting this one.
2,I just thought it was foolish. I'm a fan of Jane Feather and was looking fwd.,It was the time I think--That author has written things I've been glued to but this was not one of them.
2,could not get past her stupidity,"At first I enjoyed Sarita's vigor and courage, but was soon appalled by her willful ignorance. She is described as an intelligent young woman, but she doesn't behave as such. She knows quite well the customs of her tribe, but in the 1st chapter behaves in a way that is certain to end tragically for someone she loves. She never acknowledges her part in the results.Then she is captured and taken to the seraglio, where she clearly understands what's up, but continues to behave in a naive or foolish way. Her behaviour and the forebearance of her captor are both completely unbelievable.I like Jane Feather, and it is very rare for me to set a book aside after reading the first chapter or two. I hung on for 124 pages, but finally just realized I didn't want to spend more time with this idiot Sarita. Sorry, Jane!"
2,I agree....BORING!,"The only thing good about this book was the very first chapter and because of that chapter, I thought the book was going to be a page turner. I was completely mislead. This book was totally boring. It did not reach me at an emotional level at all. I did not find any part of this book exciting in the least and at times, I had to force myself not to put it down and never pick it back up because the author babbled on about stupid stuff. I had looked forward to reading this book and am sorry to say that I was very dissapointed. I would have to be desperate to pick up another by this author."
