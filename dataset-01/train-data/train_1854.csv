4,"I Like 'em, Wife not so much","Given the price, these sound great and fit well though my wife complains that they are too big for her head --- they are, of course, adjustible but even in the smallest notch they still seem to her to be too big. We used this product to replace wireless headphones for TV (they were either always dying or the battery stopped charging, etc...). They serve our purpose well and are inexpensive so if I drop 'em and something breaks it's no big deal (very different from the $100+ wireless ones). The included volume control is thoughtful but I find that I don't use it much - use the TV remote instead though the ability to dim the sound would be more helpful for other applications. All said, strong recommendation."
2,Headphones,These headphones fit my head fine but the sound is awful. From previous reviews I was expecting something that was of a bit better quality. They were inexpensive and look like they are made well but the sound quality makes them almost un-usable.
4,Good headphones for the price,"Wanted basic, but decent sounding headphones for running (can't stand earbuds or anything that has to hang on my ears, since they all eventually fall out or off). These work well and have good highs and lows. Not the best, but you'd have to pay a lot more $$$ to get better sound, in my opinion.Downsides: Puts enough pressure on my ears, that after an hour, earlobes start to hurt. Max volume (inline volume control) seems low.Would recommend."
2,Too Big!,"Cannot understand this model.I like Koss stuff, but this is ridiculous in width for any normal brain!Way big for any movement. They'll fall off the head.Had to return them and purchased the Sennheiser hd202's.They soud 5x as good as the Koss and fit nice and firm and hold on. Great ear cups too."
2,Imbalanced Sound,"The sound of these headphones has too little treble and too much bass. You feel like you are seated in the bass section of the orchestra and can hardly hear anything but the basses. I much prefer my Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP earbuds, which have plenty of bass, but it is not overpowering."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to a set that unfortunately broke. However, I should have put a few dollars more to get a quality product. I only get sound out of the right side, and I've only had them for 10 days."
4,good sound but a bit big,"Maybe I just have a small head. A little modifying with an exacto and superglu,I got them to fit. I didn't care for the blue strap which wasn't helping anyway. They are one of the best headphones I have owned. I like the volume control when I'm working outside and I can quickly turn it down if someone needs my attention."
4,They're pretty good.,"So yes, these are great headphones. I don't know a damn thing about headphones. I'm just saying that when everything sounds clear, the bass is nice and as a bonus I cannot hear anything else but the music, then its pretty awesome in my book.BUT, and this is why it loses a star, at its higher volumes you can hear the music outside of the headphones. And it is loud as hell. My older sibling thought I had the radio on. So because of this, I have to constantly adjust the volume to make sure the headphones aren't too loud when i'm out and about. It's not a deal breaker since I can still get a decent volume this way, but it's kind of annoying."
4,Just about Perfect for the Price,Good Output and Average Volume Control. Overall a stratified customer.
1,Bad headphones,"Just bought these for computer, ipod, and guitar listening purposes. Sound is BAD. Apple's standard earbuds are infinately better. My sennheisers (although more expensive) are also infinately better."
1,Didn't last long!,"Bought these for my son's MP3 player. They worked great for about a week, then one of the wires came loose and they were dead. Try explaining that to a 15 year old.I would not recommend them."
3,KOSS Headphone review,"These headphones are above average in performance. Howeverdo not be fooled by the many reviews seen. They do NOTsound superb as is being reported by other reviewers.I am a sound conosseuir, and these are just ordinary.ONE bad thing about it though, the ear-foam cannot be user-replaced. Mine eventually disintegrated (into powder-like stuff) but the part left on the phones cannot be removed without damaging the unit. What ??? NowI have to use sports socks as padding."
2,Good for about a month...,Felt cheap but sounded ok and had some bass but after about a month of constant use they started to make a buzzing sound on the right side when bass sounds hit.Also plug was not L shape as stated.Update: Buzzing stopped after a few days. Almost four months later sound in right sideis gone. Only used them on a desktop.
2,"Lasted for 5 months, then, ""cut out"" repeatively","I bought these headphones because I work at an email/chat center and needed a durable set of phones that were comfortable on my ears, and blocked out sound. These worked almost perfectly for the first 5 months, could hear the bass and various treble scales with a song (Ive heard everything from classical to hip-hop. Was an original 4.5 rated product. Now.... 2 points, audio is constantly cutting out and ""crackling"". Keep this for light use only and you should be ok, a great inbetween or a back-up pair set. Please do not keep as a primary set."
2,You get what you pay for,"My husband has had a pair of these for many years and really likes them so I ordered a pair to use with my iPad for use on airplane trips. I think the quality has deteriorated since my husband's purchase, but they are adequate. I forgot to take into account the noise volume of the jet engines when flying so I had to have the volume on max to hear. These are okay for listening to speech (as opposed to music) in a quiet environment. They feel flimsy. They are not especially comfortable, although I wore them continuously for 4-5 hours on a couple of cross country flights. I definitely will upgrade before I fly again."
4,"Superb sound quality, but the volume controls are trouble","I have a pair of these and I must say that while their sound quality is superb, the external volume control is already giving me problems. When Koss makes a break in the wire to splice it into a volume control, those splices have a potential to be the weakest part of the circuit and they break first.I have thought of splicing around the volume box, but the coated wires are tough to splice effectively. They should make this without the external volume control."
4,"Sound - Great, Fit - YMMV","Pro - These sound great. The price-point is hard to beat.Con - The fitting did not work for me initially. There is only one point of pivot for the speaker on each ear. These replaced a very old pair of headphones of the same price level that were shorting out. The design of the old pair had two points of swivel in the speaker over each ear creating a more comfortable fit. I imagine the over-the-head band part on these phones has a metal core as I was able to bend it to it fit better. Before bending, I could really feel the thicker band over the head (compared to the skinny band of my old set).Summary - I'm happy after bending to fit."
3,Too Big,"Pretty nice headphones, but unfortunately, they do not shorten enough for my head. They hang down below my ears even at the shortest setting. Never had that issue before. Oh well."
2,Disappointed !!!!,"After using KOSS products for years I am disappointed. First the headband was too big, so it did not fit on my ear right. If that was not bad enough, then there is the sound. The lows and highs are good but the midrange is weak. The vocals sound like they are in the background and are almost muffled at times. The cheap KOSS clip-on's sound better. This headphone just makes KOSS look and sound bad. Don't waste your money."
2,"Good...if you have a tall, skinny head","My head doesn't even come close to touching the top part of these headphones and I never use the shortest setting on headphones! They also push pretty hard against my ears giving me a headache after a short while and the foam covers are useless. The speakers feel like their digging into your head. The sound is good, not GREAT, but good for a pair of headphones at this price. I expected better after reading so many rave reviews. Either people's standards are very low or my head is freakishly misshapen.....maybe both :)"
5,Very Nice,Sound a lot better than my old Jensen headphones. High quality. The volume control has a very smooth action.
3,"good, yet odd headphones...","the sound on these headphones is quite good...and I love the handy volume control...the only issue is the design...though comfortable, it makes your head look like an oval egg...the way the headphones make my head look is embarassing...very uncool"
2,Do not fit well,"These headphoes are light, but you need to press them against your ears to fully hear the sound. There is no good position that I could find that these headphones would sit on my head comfortably. They keep slipping. On the top of that, after half an hour or so I start feeling pressure and slowly getting a headache.Maybe if you have a smaller head they might work for you, but not for me (I do have a larger than average head). I will be looking for a new pair as these are much worse than I expected, even for this price range."
2,KTXPRO1,"Needed it to work with an Ipod and it doesn't, plug on the cord it to large wondering if there is a converter. Never used them, they may work great, but I don't know what they would hook up to."
2,Does not work on Plane,I was hoping to use these on the airplane but they did not work out at all. I had to use a back up pair because I could not hear the movie on my ipad. Would not recommend.
2,won't stay put,"I am not happy with these headphones. I have several pair so I am not a novice. These have a mind of their own and when they decide they don't want to be on my head anymore they simply slip off.I have adjusted them in every way possible but eventually they end up on my nose or at the back of my head. Also, I have to keep the volume up at maximum to really hear and even then I want for more. The sound is muddy at best and I don't know how to describe the bass but it ain't right. I can hear every sound that happens around me so I think I'll stick to headphones that cover the whole ear and will keep some of the noise out. Sometimes you just get what you pay for."
3,A Gamble,"I have owned three pairs of these. Why? Because they sound splendid, they are cheap and they break.The first pair lasted over a year. The second pair lasted 6 months. The pair that broke this morning lasted one week. I used them everyday of the year on my bike ride to work. The problem is that the wires short out over time because they are cheaply made.Again, they sound amazing and are comparable to many $50+ headphones in this respect. If you like to gamble, go for it. They might last for years or break in a matter of days. I guess my Koss days are over. But i don't regret them."
5,"durable, reliable","I don't write many reviews, but I feel I had to give a quick note about how much usage I've gotten out of these headphones. I purchased them a year or so ago and was looking for a decent, reasonably priced set with inline volume control for my laptop. They far exceeded my expectations and are still going strong a year later. There are plenty of headphones for around this price range that start to cut-out after a couple of months. You know the type. The sound starts to alternate from right to left every time you move the cable. This doesn't happen with these. Highly recommended. That is all."
3,Too tall for my head! Sounds good though.,"I just received these today, and even on the shortest setting, they were too tall for my head, so I am now returning them. I am a short person, so they probably fit the average person just fine. The sound seemed to be good, and I like the volume control on the cord. I think I'll stick with buying another pair at a store, at least then I can get a full refund without return shipping if they don't fit either. I don't like having to pay for return shipping and then end up with nothing, but at least I didn't pay a lot for these."
2,Disappointed,"I got these on the same day that I got my 'Koss Folding Studio/DJ Headphones With In-Line Volume Control'. The DJ headphones are MUCH better with a just a minimal expense more.I don't have a GIGANTIC head. I have a normal size head. Yet, when I adjust this to even their smallest setting, they still do not fit well on my ears. Its like my ears hang too low! This was no problem with the DJ headphones mentioned above.I think I will send this back, and get the much better DJ headphones instead. I wrote a review on them if you would like to surf over there and read it.Bottom line: they do not fit me well and they are not nearly as comfortable as the above mentioned DJ phones.Buyer beware!Dean"
2,Save your money,Sound quality is muffled and distorted. It proves the old adage. You get what you pay for. Was recommended to help with the low volume on the Kindle Fire. Instead now I have poor sound. Sometimes you just can't win.
3,"Great value on sound quality, but the wiring is crap","Loved the sound quality for several months, especially for the amount they cost. However, the wiring is starting to give out on them now. I've got to jiggle the cord and fiddle with the connector to get sound out of both headphones. It's a common problem for any headphones, so I'm not too disappointed given the price."
5,Excellent Product/Value,I bought these headphones to use with my 100 year old compact disc player after the old headphones gave out. I bought these on the strength of all the positive reviews and I couldn't be happier. The audio quality is fantastic and I love the volume control. I use them when I exercise and they stay put on my head. Fantastic value.
4,Certainly worth the money,"I just purchased an ipod and really enjoy music so I wanted something much better than the earbuds that come with it. I began my research and read a number of reviews on various headphones. I also wanted to be able to use them on my home stereo. I read a number of reviews on Sennheiser, Grado, Koss, etc. There were pros and cons to all of them. However the Senn PX100 and Koss Portapro rated consistently well. While reading a review on the Koss Portapro, one reviewer also commented that the KTXPRO1 was very good. So I decided to go with the Koss KTXPRO1 AND the Portapro. I was not disappointed by the KTXPRO1 however compared to the Portapro, they are not in the same league. So if you're looking for a good set of phones and can't afford the $37 go with these; you won't be disappointed. However, if you can spend the $37, get the Portapro as they sound much fuller."
3,NOT portable at all and a little bassy,"I was not nearly as enthused as many other reviewers about the sound of these. They were OK, but a little bassy and without much presence in the vocal/guitar ranges. Wish they were better. Another thing, they are certainly NOT portable as they claim, can't be folded nor do they come with a pouch."
3,Only lasted 2 Years with minimal use,"Bought these 2 years ago and intially was happy with purchase. Sound is good but not great. I have a large head and after wearing for an hour or so I would begin to feel discomfort. The built-in volume control is a nice but not necessarily a needed feature. After 2-years of minimal use the right side speaker stopped working. Not too bad for 15 bucks, but I am use things lasting longer as I take excellent care of my stuff."
3,Hurts the ears,Im used to the porta pros and the ear curshions on this one are small and hurt my ears after extended use. Sound is almost as good as porta pros
4,Good quality and a good price,"I bought these as a gift for my son. He used them a lot and said he really like the sound (and he is picky). His younger brother broke them and there was almost a war. Now that they have settled back down, it might be wise to buy two sets!"
2,Misleading Name,"These are OK headphones, but it is NOT portable. They do not fold up, down, or shrink in any way. The blue thing on the top is an odd silicone strap that makes the headphones comfy, but really messes up your hair. The sound quality is OK."
3,Not worth what I paid,"These headphones fit nicely and look great, but sound is what is important. There was adequate bass sound, yet the speakers were lacking in the balance of treble. Too much fuzz, not enough sound definition. The cheaper Sony headphones I was intending to replace still sound better! Pass and try another model."
2,uncomfortable,I thought these were uncomfortable and wouldn't stay in place. My husband said they were okay for him. Maybe my head is just small. (i.e. - no brains)????
3,Good for a while...,"Great headphones for the price, but SHAME on Koss for not making the foam pieces replaceable. They disintegrate within a couple years and are useless after that. Planned obsolescence?"
2,Volume slider shorts out,"These are some pretty average-sounding headphones. The cool thing that I liked about them was the volume control on the cable. However, it was entirely uncool when the volume control shorted out. We didn't mistreat these things. We use them while walking on a treadmill and there's never any stress put on the cable. Through typical use of the volume control it has proven that it wasn't well-made. Listen, when you have to twist and squeeze the volume control several different ways just to get sound to come back on in both ears = FAIL."
4,Great Value. Almost Perfect,"These are a great value. I like the open air system. I can hear the phone ring or someone knock on the door while listening. It's so lightweight - you can wear them comfortably for hours. The sound (for the money) is excellent. The volume control comes in handy. I'm not very big and the ""tightest"" setting is almost too loose."
2,Too Large,"The sound quality was wonderful after too many pairs of cheap headphones, but that didn't mean much since they wouldn't stay on my head. NOT adjustable to fit anyone with a smaller head."
1,Negative,I think that the headphones were great but they broke way to fast the part where it plugs in broke off the first day i used it and i sent it back and still havnt gotten a refund or a new pair i bought these in march got them on the 31st of march and i still havent gotten anything very dissoponting.
3,Ok for the price,"The headphones fit comfortably on my head, pressing a little on my ears. The sound was also pretty good, but not above average. On the other hand, I would never wear these out of my house due to how old school they look and how bulky they would be since they don't collapse to carry around."
1,Waste of money just horrible.,"Well where do I start they don't fit well I am constantly adjusting them to keep them on my head, since KOSS has a lifetime warranty I had to replace them twice that is three headphones within a year. I lost sound in the right one on the first purchase then the left one, then the plug went.Not sure if they just gave me a refurbished headphone when I replace it the 2nd and 3rd time. Save yourself the headache try another headphone. I don't know what is going on with the quality of products but I have had headphones for my other players in the past that worked great. I guess I will keep looking."
5,They are even great for Granny!,"Needing a new pair of headphones I bought Koss portable headset as I used to own a huge pair of Koss stereophones and loved the sound quality. The cheap Sony headphones, that came with my portable player, were uncomfortable, fair sound quality, and the cord wiring came loose in under a month. As an audiophile my ears were aching. The Koss KTX Pro1 were perfect for me. And perfect for my 75-year-old Mom! She never wanted to wear headphones and always complained that they hurt her ears and head. But after she wore my Koss headphones, adjusted them to her head, and listened to her favorite music, she hasn't given them back! And she can adjust the soundlevel on the cord to her own hearing level.So, I am headed back to the store to buy another set of Koss KTXPro1 for myself!"
5,Extremely good quality headphones!,"I tell you, never in my life have i seen such good quality headphones for under twenty dollars. This headphones have such quality that is beyond great! Koss has nailed it! It can fit into any mp3/cd walkman device and whats best is that it comes with a volume control tab, so if you feel like blasting your music at a super high volume, you can! Although they can look a little bit dorky, they feel extremely comfortable when you put them on around your ears. You can of course adjust the fit of these wonderful headphones which also makes this product a better buy.If you want great quality headphones that feel comfortable, buy these ones made buy Koss!"
4,Great sound quality - and inexpensive.,Very light and comforable. The deep bass these reproduce will surprise you. Accuracy across the bandwidth is quite good and they'll play loud (high efficiency) without distortion on portables or Soundblaster Live on computer. Buy 'em for great sound... but not ruggedness! You won't be disappointed.
2,"Okay, but not comfortable( for me)","I found these to be very uncomfortable, and the fit is odd. They just feel wierd. Sound quality is decent, and for the price they're okay. I would not buy again."
4,headphones. they are good.,good value for the money. volume control only goes as loud as your internal setting on the equipment you plug into.I use it to listen to streaming netflix movies on my netbook.I like the top strap. it holds onto the head nicely.
5,Excellent headphones,"These are excellent headphones. The sound quality is tremendous, especially considering the reasonable price. I highly recommend this product."
4,"Good sound, Medium Comfort",These headphones offer a great sound quality for the price. I only have 2 issues with these headphones: 1. They are a little harsh on the ears (they squeeze your ears to your head pretty good). 2. The adjustable band is not quite small enough for my head (a small adult). They really do produce a good quality sound and the price- especially with free shipping (if you spend the qualifying amount)- can't be beat even at local shops.
3,Great sound! Terrible fit.,"Headphones usually come in 2 kinds: wimpy and tinny with no bass, or a terrible muddy sound. These Koss headphones were the first pair I`ve ever used that had REAL bass without sacrificing clarity, but there`s just one problem: They do NOT FIT. AT ALL. If you are bald, or just a small person with a small head, forget about using these things if you plan on doing alot of moving around, the headphones just keep sliding off your head. So excersize is out of the question. They`re good for sitting in front of the PC when you play your games or music though."
3,"Fair, good for inexpensive headphones","Bought these to use at work 'cause I was tearing up my Koss Porta Pro's. After a side by side listening test, I can most definitely hear the difference. The Porta Pro's have a better low and high end (they should have for twice the price), not quite as efficient as the KXTPRO1's (more volume on the KXT's than the Porta-Pro's at the same setting). Having said that, for the money they are a good buy and have Koss's Lifetime Warranty. If you have the extra bucks, go for the Porta Pro's."
2,Speaker blown after a couple of months,The left speaker blew out after a short while. Return window is only 30 days; thought I'd share my pain...
4,Yep Great Bought 2,"Just as everyone says - but the volume control is NOT gray like in the photo - it's black and these are EXACTLY the same as the same Titanium headphones I bought from Radio Shack a few years ago - - - NO DIFFERENT / just at a great price... so glad I found them here!Just wish the blue thing over the head was more ""in style"" but who cares... the rubber part keeps it on my head while I'm jogging. It's good."
4,Great for the PC,"Due to the ever increasing volume of my CD's converted to mp3's on my computer,I needed a better pair of headphones.The Koss KTXPRO1 work quite well with a PC.They are lightweight.The overall frequency response including the bass is good."
4,Great sound but uncomfortable,"These headphones sound amazing for the price, way better than I expected them to. For 13 bucks they are a steal. My only complaint is that they don't fit my ears well. I have average size ears, maybe even a little on the small side but for some reason they just don't fit right. My left ear feels pinched...However it doesn't bother me enough for me to stop wearing them. I use them w/ my creative mp3 player and they sound a lot better than the earbuds it came with. I like the volume control on the wire. Overall these are great headphones, especially for the price."
4,Great Head Phones,"All,Trust me if you are really looking for great low - high spectrum these are great headphones. You just can't get the sound quality out of the bud styles, these are old school but worth it !"
3,Koss KTPRO1 good value for the money,I bought these headphones to replace and older pair of Koss Optimus pro headphones that were from Radio Shack. The KTX PRo1 sound quality is not as good as the Optimus ones I already own.I will keep looking for better sounds quality. For the price these are a good deal..
3,Average,"After reading lots of glowing reviews of these headphones I ordered a pair. I should have spent a bit more and got a better quality pair of headphones. The sound quality is decent, but not great. What I really don't like is that no matter how I place these on my head they don't fit properly or feel comfortable. They looked light and comfortable in the pictures and they are light, but the way the speakers swivel they won't angle properly. The sound seems a little muffled, not completely clear. They do go loud though and I do like the volume control.I have an old pair of lightweight cheapo headphones that came with an inexpensive portable CD player that fit better and are more comfortable and the sound quality is about the same, but a little clearer although they don't get as loud. My advice? Spend a little more and get a better pair. You can't always go by the reviews I guess, I'm very disappointed, I'll end up giving them away because I just can't position them on my head comfortably."
2,They're OK Headphones,"Decent for listening to music, etc. But I wish I had saved my money and just bought a higher quality headphone set sooner."
3,it works,it works but the range is limited and the foam covering over the speakers look like they will deteriorate quickly
5,Good for the price.,"If you like over the ear headphones, these are definitely worth considering -- good sound, good price, light on head, and with a volume control."
4,crisp and clear,Koss headsets are comfortable to wear and very clear sound. Volume control is a very helpful feature. Would recommend this purchase.
3,Great Sound! Cheap Head Phones......,"The head phones sound great! The size of the head phones, suck. In all honesty, I do have a big head and these head phones are not made for adults, I believe they are made for children's head or a small adult.Also what is up with that Blue Rubbery Head Band? It has absolutely no purpose, other than to mess up your hair."
1,This ones pretty cheap,"This head set is all plastic and very weak, and arrived DOA shorted out on one side. Not worth sending back, just to flimsy for me, would pass on this one also hurts the ears just dont fit to your head ya keep wanting to bend em to fit and then this will break em."
1,wonderful,"The best sounding junk phones ever made that will last less than 30 day and short out.I have spend over 200.00 this year for headphones but these are perfect for great sound and far better than I expected for sound only. I think you'll need to spend 100.00 bucks to get better.These are cheap top trash.I called to warrantee and the guy said this was a joke number given on the package, I dialed the number again and he got angry. This is not a real deal just a fake number. I just sent them back for a replacement and I will get another 3 weeks phone and then return them for a refund when they short out.Do not buy these if you plan to need them to work for mopre than 3 weeks."
2,Fair Product,"Titanium means very light weight. These are light. Sound is OK, but you have to press them against your ears to get full sound. Also, I am not bald, so the phones keep slipping off my head. I use them for my iPod. It's a good thing I'm sitting instead of jogging. I suppose for the price, they are ok, but I'd rather spend a few dollars more and get a heavier headset. (I did buy a more expensive pair.)"
1,Drudgery and Dreariness,"The authors certainly seem to have done their homework on the time period - the endnotes are extensive. (But who expected endnotes in a novel, anyway?) Unfortunately, the endnotes are the only interesting part of the book. While the story may have been good (I don't know; I didn't get that far.), the writing was awful. The characters were unbelievable and did not resemble Austen's characters of the same names. The dialogue was stilted and fake. Descriptions were forced. All in all, I found this very amateurish. I could not ""get lost"" in the story or ""feel"" the characters because the poor writing continually drew my attention. After several chapters, it was simply too painful to continue reading and I returned the book to the library. I do not believe I have ever read such a poorly-written story."
1,Jane Austin this isn't!!,"I've read several Pride & Prejudice sequels in recent weeks, this is by far the worst.While the Bader's did an admirable job of keeping with the historical acurateness of the novel, they didn't really seem to understand the characters or what made them appealing in the first place.We have Lady Catherine who in the interest of Family Felicity forgives Mr. Darcy for marrying beneath him. Lady Catherine is a vindictive witch who would never have given up her haughty prideful behaviour and sure wouldn't have accepted Elizabeth who was said to pollute Pemberly.We have Mr. Darcy becoming warm and open with everyone. Showing his affection in public. And Elizabeth, she seems to have become a 'dutiful' wife, not the Willful lady we all adore."
2,nicely crafted and well researched,"The authors have clearly delivered a thoughtfully crafted tale, consistent with the history and customs and class and sexual politics of the times. However, it lacks shine and wit for my taste. I miss the delightful and droll humor of Jane Austen, often causing me to laugh out loud after 2-3 pages of dialogue building to an understated punch. For those who love the P&P characters, they are here; as are their times. For those who love Jane Austen's writing gift, alas, it is lacking."
1,My Disapointment knows no bounds,"I read The great reviews and was looking forward to this so much but I was so disappointed. I know the authors claimed not to have the syntax etc. but they didn't have the spirit either. The plot was non-existent - I mean poor character development, purely superficial dialogue, I often wondered what was the point of reducing Jane Austen's characters to such simplistic thoughts. All of my favourite Characters - by the end of the book I just hated them all."
1,Very disappointing,"I love the works of Jane Austen and have looked for sequels that show me more of the world of her characters. There are some very fine ones, including Anne Telscombe's Sanditon and the works of Julia Barrett, but this is not one of them. The book almost seems to be written for children in its extreme simplicity and moralizing. The authors are not true to Austen's characterization, either - Mr. Darcy is frank and open about skeletons in the family closet, and Georgiana is obsessed with religion. I also found the Historical Notes distracting and unnecessary; they seemed to be included only to show how ""knowledgeable"" the authors were about the period and did not have much at all to do with the text. I find it interesting that these authors have reviewed their own book (very positively) on this website and others. There would be no need for such stuffing of the ballot-box if the book stood well on its own."
1,"Unless you want to know how bad it is,","give this book a miss. There's a total lack of character development. Everyone, including Mr Darcy and Lizzy, became so dull and dumb. And what irritated me most was the way every single event in P&P was referred to. It feels like the authors are trying TOO hard to justify its own work."
2,If you like Pride and Predjudice - Skip this book,I was very excited when I was given this book as a gift. Like most people I like to know what happens to characters after a book is over. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are such compelling characters. I was very disappointed when I read this book. The authors did not do a good job at all in duplicating Jane Austen's style of writing. Some of the dialouge was almost laughable. They made Mr. Darcy very preachy on the evils of strong drink. I suppose this is because one of the authors is a Dr.There is a much better sequel by Julia Barret named Pemberly. It is excellent. Skip Desire and Duty and read Pemberly.
1,Can I give it a zero?,Ugh. Moralistic and unrealistic. Terrible dialog and a sagging plot. The cover was misleading- this was one of the least academic and most juvenile attempts at a P&P sequel ever. Don't bother.
1,This book was awful,"This book was absolutely awful! There were way too many undeveloped characters. Both the newly introduced characters and the characters from Pride and Prejudice have no personality whatsoever. There isn't a single plot worth reading until the end, and everything is so predictable. The sentences are extremely awkward, including Mr. Darcy telling Lizzy, ""I was fearful of losing the light of my life..."" and Lizzy telling Mr. Darcy, ""...you are my tower of strength."" Way too sappy, and and there was no purpose to include all this sickening nostalgia. i almost didn't finish it, this book was simply terrible. don't read it!!"
1,Sophmoric Dribble,"While I will read anything that is even remotely related to Jane Austen, or her story lines, I had to force myself to finish this questionable piece of literature. A high school essay mocking romantic drama would have been better than the forced dialogue between the characters, odd behaviors that were out of sync for the time period and stilted story line that were delivered here. Very disappointing...don't bother."
1,Horrible horrible book,I was quite excited when I first heard about this book. Imagine my disappointment when I actually read it. Neither wit nor cleverness were to be found anywhere within its pages. It had disturbing relgious overtones that made me think the author had more of an affinity with Mr. Collins than Elizabeth Bennet.
2,Tolerable Tale,"I happened upon this book by chance and was very excited to give it a shot. I kept in mind, though, that any sequel to a novel, not written by the same author, is bound to disappoint. Yes, I was disappointed in this book - the characters were very flat and the story was predictable - but I had to remind myself that the authors gave it their all. The book is not for everyone, but any fan of Pride and Prejudice should give it a chance to decide for themselves."
2,An Easy Read!,"This is not the best P&P sequel since it does not further develop the relationship of Eliza and Darcy. However, it is a pleasant read."
1,Thank Ghod I didn't buy for this turkey!,"Hooray for the library - I can give this one back and never see it again. Terrible, stilted writing, laughable dialogue, a dull and predictable plot, AND heavy-handed religious moralizing that would never have passed Jane Austen's pen. I felt throughout that the authors were trying to put across their own religious agenda. The characters were not true to P&P and the book had absolutely none of Austen's wit and sparkle. I finished it, but I will never touch a book by these authors again."
4,A delightful sequel,"Desire and Duty is a delightful sequel to Pride and Prejudice. The characters and story line are entertaining and engaging. Even while reading it the second time I enjoyed it so much I found it difficult to put it down. I would recommend Desire and Duty to everyone, whether you are a Jane Austin fan or not."
1,The worst book ever published...,"I would have given this negative stars but it wasnt an option. I haven't even read this book because the first 10 pages were enough to tell me that the author of this insipid piece of trash should be jailed for assault on the senses of the public. If Ms. Austen were alive she'd be suing for damages. The language is third grade elementary at best and the idea that Elizabeth Bennett (possibly the greatest heroine ever written)would ever whine about anything, let alone Darcy wanting to work instead of eat breakfast with her, is INSANE and a reaction only her sister Lydia would have! Save your money and buy the BBC production of P&P with Colin Firth (ding dong) and Jennifer Ehle (while you're at it buy Bridgett Jones too). The only place you will get a true representation of the beloved characters Jane Austen created. ..."
2,Who Bombed Birmingham,Didn't translate well to the screen.Interesting topic to some (me) would have been better served in a short book or part of a larger work on British corruption/frustration during the recent troubles.
5,Best of its kind,"I've really liked this mop ever since I bought it a couple of years ago. Then I couldn't find refills any more and bought two other similar mops, but they were pathetic by comparison.Yes, it's hard to push the wringer sleeve down when the refill is new, but I can do it and I'm a 60-something, not particularly strong woman. After a few uses, it gets easy. And, unlike the other brands which are still dripping wet after ""wringing"" this one is wrung out well enough that it doesn't leave your floor a puddle that takes forever to dry like the others do."
1,I'm not Charles Atlas,"This mop sounded great, and maybe it is if you are strong enough to move the ringer mechanism. It may get easier to move with time, but if you can't get it to move in the first place without straining something, then you are not going to want to use it again, anyway. It's a waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
5,Wonderful,"This is a fantastic slow cooker. In the month or so that I've had it, I've already cooked numerous dishes and they've all been great.It doesn't burn the food (like many programmable crockpots would), and the ""warm"" setting is very useful. Highly recommended product and without complaints. The meals are so big they typically last 3-5 days.Just make sure to increase the quantity of ingrediants when cooking meals intended for 3 1/2 quart crockpots or smaller."
4,Makes one great pot of chili after another....,"When I was shopping for a slow cooker about a year ago I wanted something different from the usual round ""crock pot"" but that would also do the job. When I took this out of the box I knew that I'd hit the bullseye on the looks (the photo doesn't do this model justice) but I had to see how well it cooked a pot of chili. Well, I soon found out I was 2 for 2.The deduction is for something I hadn't considered when ordering: It's difficult to clean the removable pan. The 9 by 13 dimensions make it a bit tricky moving it under the faucet (even w/a double sink). Your best bet is to clean right away after use.The plastic snap-on lid is a great way to store the cooked food in the fridge or take it on the road. All in all, a fine product."
5,Economic Growth and Development: Reveiw,"This is an excellent economic development book for the undergraduate and masters level audience. The focus of this book as compared to other development books (i.e. Todaro) is that it emphasizes the importance of economic growth rather than equity issues. I find this approach refreshing. Van den Berg uses historical and current case studies to bring the theory out of the book and into the real world. Overall, Economic Growth and Development is an informative and stimulating read for professors, students, and anyone else who is interested in understanding why some countries are developed while others are still developing. Five stars!"
3,Good technical reference,This book contains nothing new. All this material is available from Cisco's onlie home page. Although it present the material for a novice to understand.
5,Kasino's got game,"It's a solid song, I have heard a lot from Kasino this song showed his versatility. I look forward to his album Game of life, I expect it will be different due to his newest appearence on the Lox we are the streets"
4,Good Combo,"Good combination of products. Radio, Alarm Clock, Call-Id Telephone. Hum. Are people getting to picky and choosy. I like to be waken up (heavy sleeper) instead of missing the flight or the meeting.This is a good product overall and excellent price-value."
3,Phone works great but..,"it's impossible to use the speed dial mode that won't program numbers and you can't manually set the time. Since 8 out of 10 phones I've bought had static for reception, the really good phone is a big plus to ME."
1,Too Defensive,"Remember when Martin Bashir made a fool out of Michael Jackson, so Jacko released his own coutervideo? This was like that. I guess ""60 Minutes"" and a CT newspaper called a place Heroin Town due to the large number of heroin addicts at one falling-apart hotel. This tries to be the counternarrative.The work says things like, ""Not all of us are addicts"" and ""We have summer fairs in this town!"" Well, most drug centers have non-addicts in the vicinity. And they are financially-challenged like the non-addicts interviewed here. This work may help bring investment and governmental dollars into this town, but this is not strong viewing for those unfamiliar with the topic.This may be a lesson in ""don't throw out the baby with the bath water."" It may also be a tail on how the media can demonize populations and blow things out of proportion. Still, this work doesn't have what's needed to stand the test of time."
4,It was a gift,They are planning to build a new barn and planning guide brought up things they had not considered in their design
4,Gotta knock a star of for it's Communist Utopianism....but,"Otherwise, it's the most outstanding book I've read this year.It's highly readable if you've got a graduate level education; if ""My Day at the Zoo"" gives you a headache, perhaps you should wait for the ""Empire for Dummies"" version comes out.Having said that, the indictment made in this work IS indeed staggering- and prophetic, given our current domestic terrorism being perpetrated by the collaboration of Islamic Fundamentalists and John Ashcroft.A MUST READ to understand the REAL problems behind globalism, ""terrorism,"" and the United States!"
1,A leftist that hated this crap!,"First off, I'm a leftist. But I'm not willing to sacrifice the idea that one should argue ones political position. This book tries to find a justification for resistance to Empire. What is Empire? It is simply never defined except as ""world order"" which is in turn defined only negatively (IE. as what world order is NOT as opposed to what it IS). Marx was a terrible writer. But at least at the core of his ideas were concrete concepts like ""class"" and ""capitalism"". I think I have working definitions of these things. I have no definition of Empire or half the other abused terms like ""ontological"" and ""juridical"" in this piece of trash. Yes, I know what these words mean, but my definitions of them just don't do the kind of work these authors intend these terms to do for them. Go read Marx! He has some *major* problems, but at least once you decipher the prose you will be left with actual concepts."
1,returnio ad absurdum,"Never doubt the staying power of stupidity. Dig up an old Italian murderer (no euphamisms here) and some washed up academic slob with elbow patches and dress up the the same old swill with a nice touch of French post-structuralism and watch the idiots come running.If this is the best the left has got, they are in a lot of trouble."
1,So typical of European intellectuals:...,"....do not write for the readers, do write for yourself!"". The less the mass understand the better. Just one question: are you sure you know where you're going, or you're writing it for money? Wouldn't qualify for the ""top thousand things to do with your money""."
1,booooooring,"I have sympathy for the perspective of the authors, but that is no excuse for the turgid prose."
1,Other than that...,"One author is in prison because of his involvement in the assassination of an Italian prime minister. The other is a professor of Italian literature who thinks that qualifies him to comment on economics, history, politics, and sociology. The prose is pompous on those rare occasions when it is comprehensble. The ideas are childish.Other than that, it's a great book."
3,How to limit readership,"Hardt and Negri's ""Empire"" Has many intriguing insights into the New World Order. It is a completely fresh treatment of an evolutionary model of economics. Unfortunately it is written in language that is pretentiously arcane and inaccessible to most readers. Here's a sample: ""New figures of struggle and new subjectivites are produced in the conjuncture of events, in the universal nomadism..."" If someone were to rewrite this book in plain Enlish it would have a considerable impact."
2,As Confusing as a Bunch Sprint Finish in the Dark,"I liked the decriptions of the races, very exciting, especially the climactic Worlds race. But the stuff off the bike was just pure muddled confusion to me. I often wondered if this book weren't written by someone that doesn't speak English and the confusion was due to a bad translator. I'm still not exactly sure what was going on."
4,Such a monster - Schweinstein!,"Schwein Rules!This album is an amalgamation of three musical styles. The electro-funk of PIG (Raymond Watts), industrial-rock of KMFDM, and the electronic-japanese-pop-metal-misc sound of Buck-Tick come together rather well.Seldom do you hear an album with lyrics in three languages. Schwein does it well. This ""Super Project Band"" is awesome. This is one of the three best albums I've heard this year."
5,"Schwein, you're mine forever!","ah yes, at long last, I received my copy of Schwein. Is it worth the wait?...yes, it is worth every eternal second I spent wondering when it would arrive. There are very few weak moments on this album, and if a weak moment arrives it is for a brief moment. Sascha, and Raymond,Atushi, Hisashi and even Lucia put together an amazing album. Some lyrics are in english, others in German, while most of the lyrics are in Japanesse...the combination is pulled off surprisingly well, definatly worth picking up, despite it's 30+ price tag. <pig> + KMFDM + Buck Tick = sheer glory. (I can't stress that enough)You're my Disease, Crown, Schwein, Worlds Junk, and Porno stand out from the rest of the album as my more favorite tracks....but I love the whole album....not one dull moment. Yes, I am a fanatic =O). go ahead, add it to your shopping cart, you won't be sorry."
2,schwein,"OK, so i've been a KMFDM fan for years and i've also liked alot of <PIG> albums, but nothing really reminicent of KMFDM or Pig really transfers into schwein. Most of the album has no direction in the songs. They start nowhere and go nowhere. Just a random beat or really cool synth line will appear and then fade into trash. No songs convey any energy and the vocal content (at least whats in english and some of the german) is quite minimal. Sascha K. said himself that he thought Shwein was a ""sub-par"" effort and thats a member of the group saying that. I dont know, maybe too much of the Buck Tick bleeds through (but i have to admit the japanese vocals sound pretty neat) or maybe it was just a lack of funding or time, but schwinstein presents alot of potential for the ""supergroup"", but they just dont deliver it on this album"
1,Disappointing,"After reading the multiple positive reviews for this book, I expected a book that is much more insightful than I found this one. I work for an Internet company, and found this book to be targeted more at Web neophytes, more specifically large businesses without a web presence, but who want some thoughts on how to get started with taking advantage of all of the benefits the Internet can offer their business. Most of its discussions end with Q4 1998, which in Internet time is woefully out of date. I unfortunately found no original insights from this book, and believe that anyone who keeps up with the industry would have a similar experience."
5,Learn from the leaders in Web commerce!,This book is a must read. I value e-business texts that are based on the case studies of successful E-commerce leaders. The 24 leaders who contributed to this book know what the front lines are all about!
1,A Very Minimal Player,"We bought this player for our daughter, and are returning it after 24 hours. It would get zero stars, if possible.The player only works with very Windows Media Player 9 or 10. If you're using the current version (11), you're out of luck. The player holds about 48 songs when downsampled to 32Kbps. Even for a kid, that's pretty bad quality.The navigation and controls aren't great. The music library software for your PC is clunky and unresponsive. The company's web site is extremely annoying -- entirely flash based; I had an extremely hard time registering the product, and even once it claimed I'd succeeded, I still couldn't access protected areas of the site.For twice the money, you can get a Shuffle -- a much better value."
4,Beyond direct manipulation,"The author challenges us to start thinking beyond direct manipulation. The metaphor of physical location for digitally stored information likely to be surpassed as we continue our journey ""from atoms to bits""."
2,"Moments of insight, but reads like a college senior essay","There are definitely good thoughts in there, but the strained analogies, questionable historical context and funny 25-cent words make this read more annoying than insightful. If only he didn't tried so hard."
2,"Good first chapter, little ensuing worth","The premise of the book set out in the first chapter was fascinating. Interfaces shape our perceptions, just as Marshall McLuhan proclaimed in ""The Medium is the Message.""Unfortunately, this critical eye didn't find its way into the remainder of the book. I consider ""Interface Culture"" to be a history of computer interfaces rather than an interpreter of the way our perceptions have changed."
1,Terrible,"In 1999, the year this book was published, this book would still have been 1 star. Today it's zero, but I gave it 1 star... why not. This book is what's wrong with books. It was boring for starters. Like so many other authors, the author failed to engage his reader. Like other reviewers have said, it reads like a college essay. Also... He's all. over. the. place. And he quotes so many people it speaks of a rookie writer relying on and appealing to authority, detracting away from his own perspective. Lastly, there is no main point in this book, at least not one clearly defined. It's simply a hodge podge of loosely related philosophical ramblings it's just not insightful.No easy way to say this but it's trash."
2,I judged this book by the editorial reviews,"The author has a great skill with the English language. His vocabulary is extensive, his skill with adjectives overwhelming. I felt like it was a Harlequin Romance version of a technical paper. He uses so many quotes and references it reminded me of a overwritten term paper. I found myself drifting in my own thoughts while waiting for the point to be made."
2,"Good premise, poor execution","The fundamental ideas expressed in this book are important and I applaud the author for recognizing them and bringing them to our attention. I just wish he hadn't done so in such a needlessly wordy and meandering fashion. This book could easily have been limited to the length of an essay and conveyed the same ideas. My biggest gripe, however, is the painful, self-consciously hip way in which the book is written. The author seems to really want to be perceived as extremely cool, and this annoying tendency adds a lot of unnecessary fluff to the book. Word of advice - when you see something on a book jacket that reads (as this one does) ""In this hip, erudite manifesto...."" just put the book back on the rack, back slowly away, and get the hell out of there."
2,It was a chore,"I chose this book to read as an out of class reading assignment. I literally had to trudge through it and forced myself to finally finish it a week before I had to make a report on it. There were times when I would wonder if he was ever going to get to the point, and alas, he didn't. This book is about everything BUT what the subject of the book is supposed to be about. I donated it to the library a week after giving my report."
3,High hype-to-substance ratio: still it was interesting,"Johnson makes lots of claims that interface design will be the art form of the future, but doesn't really give us a lot of information on how to build a better mousetrap. The book is a good overview of current trends in interface design and occasionally has some thoughtful criticism, but is way short in the recommendations end. He repeats a lot of stuff covered by McLuhan and Laurel"
3,Some few good thoughts but limited,"This is one of the best technoculture books I've read, but don't expect great things, I guess there's still missing THE book in this area. Johnson shows here his literature knowledge but for a complete analysis of society and technology you need a lot more. If you have 20 dollars and a free afternoon, read it."
4,"Good level for skimming, a few good insights","This book didn't draw me into slow and careful reading mode, but I found some of the insights genuinely useful. The business about links being intrinsic to the meaning of the text (as opposed to just being tacked on as references) is a case in point. Nice insight, for example, into why the early suck.com was so compelling."
5,Most Beautiful Voice,Martina has the most beautiful voice ever. I love every song on this album and listen to it daily. A house of a thousand words is haunting and beautiful.
3,Up and Down,"Let me preface this by saying that this was the first Martina McBride album I ever bought. I have since bought a few of her earlier albums. 'Waking Up Laughing' is an album that is very pleasant and endearing to listen to over-all, but in spots the lyrics are downright clutsy. I am not quite sure why some country artists feel the need to reaffirm their faith in God in songs to the general public--can't we figure that out for ourselves? She is sweet and she is good and all that but somehow I can't get around the fact that she has to spell that out so often. Martina works the same sort of material, in the same vein as Patty Loveless, but Patty did it in a way that does not make you feel below her-- she's just one of us. Martina's voice is beautiful, but I think it may have dropped half-an-octave. She sounds like she is pushing it a bit on many songs. I do, however, recommend this album."
3,Beautiful Voice - Depressing Music,"I've been a Martina fan for a long time, and I've always been very proud of her social awareness songs. ""Independence Day"" and ""Concrete Angel"" for example - these move you and motivate all of us to be more aware of what happens around us. These songs have come sporadically, and they've been extremely powerful and moving. Until now.This CD is full of depressing songs. If that was her goal - she's reached it with flying colors. Even the potentially uplifting song, ""Beautiful Again"" has multiple depressing moments. There isn't a single uplifting, just-for-fun song on this CD.I listen to Martina's Greatest Hits album on a regular basis. This woman can SING! But this album came to my house on a Monday and was listed for sale here on Amazon two days later. It's simply not what I've come to expect from her."
3,Down-Tempo Martina.,"As always with Martina this is a quality collection. Martina is a lovely lady who has consistently delivered over the last decade and more,but this cd seems a little too down-tempo. Don't get me wrong I like the album, but a little bit of party music among the power ballads would,in my mind, have improved the set. Following the ""Timeless"" covers collection this whole album seems to be a little too much in the comfort zone. Perhaps Martina should get in a co-producer next time out to bring in a wee bit more variety. As with Alan Jackson's recent cd it's hard to find stand-out tracks here after a single listen,apart from ""Anyway"" which has been around for 6 or 7 months now.Don't be put off, this is a good album, I just expected a bit more."
2,"2 3/4 stars, but not 3","I am a Martina fan, but don't care for this cd. I agree with the other reviewers who think this album has an over-produced sound. Timeless was great and ""A Broken Wing"" has to be one of my all-time favorite songs, but this album missed the mark. Even ""Anyway"" which is probably the best song on the cd doesn't quite measure up to some of her past hits. If you are a new Martina fan try out an earlier album."
3,"LOVE MARTINA, BUT...","I do love Martina. I think she is a great talent who has chosen her material very wisely over the years. However, there is just something different about this cd. Her voice is excellent form and many of the songs she has selected do have social messages and this is always a good thing. The problem is that this album is a much more depressing that her previous releases. With the exception of the first single, ""Anyway"" there really is not a positive, uplifting song in the bunch. I have listened to this album many times and always find myself turning it off before the end of the cd. I guess it could be summed up this way: I do not believe many of the songs to be radio friendly and while it is important to give the folks something to think about when they listen, you should never underestimate the value of a nice melody and catchy chorus.The best examples of Martina's talent are her ""Greatest Hits"" cd and the new live concert dvd. It will be well worth your time."
5,"Paper, water and flour","You can make a fake tooth with paper, water and flour. Children think that's a pretty smart idea until Russell Hoban's whimsical tooth fairies propose making a fake child out the same material. For children whose teeth are falling out regularly, this is a superb and very funny adventure story. It's good for grandparents, too. And the drawings are wonderful, especially when the toy car gets involved in a car chase. Every household with toothless children should have this book."
4,Coinicidence of Love,"Molly Garcia was in for a shocked when she went to welcome her new neighbor only to find out it was Dimitri her first lover from when she was a teenager visiting Pondki, an island of Greece. While in shock of seeing him she hears a voice at the back of him and is introduce to a pretty young girl name Zoe she begin to wonder who could this be. She later finds out she is his daugher and she is fifteen years old. She starts to the math and realize she was born not long after she left the island and begins to wonder if her relationship with him was just a whim. Eventhough this a romance and you know it is going to end with a happen ending it was still quite enjoyable because it dealth with Molly being a divorce woman and Dimitri being a widower and having to deal with a teenager daugher. I believe any woman and i dare say man who love romance would enjoy this."
4,Great shower radio,"Excellent product for the shower.Only thing is hard to see buttons if mounted high, since on top of unit. Sounds is good, reception great."
5,Best shower radio ever,"I owned a Sharper Image shower radio (the kind with suction cups that sticks to the shower wall) for years until it died on me, and thought the poor sound quality is the price you pay for a waterproof radio. I'm so sorry I didn't buy the Sony sooner! The sound quality is tremendous. It isn't waterproof but I keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem. I love the big preset selection (including local TV channels), the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own. Great machine."
5,great radio! best ever,"first, thanks to those of you that reviewed this item before me - it helped make my decisionsecond, this is a great radio! it's just what i needed for the bathroom - helps me get to work on time, the radio works the best!! and i should know - we live in a very rural area and every other radio i tried got little to no signal - get LOTS of stations on this little radio - and has tons of functions also...hubby loves the weather feature too!do not hesitate - get this item!"
4,"Very good sound, needs better shower mounting options...","This radio has been good - I have owned several Sony shower-type radios, and this unit's quality is among the best. Very good sound, built very solidly, controls are easy to use and understand. My only wish is that they had better mounting options - I have it hanging from a shower mirror now, there has got to be a better way to mount a radio, with a holster-type bracket or something..."
1,Stopped working after a month,"What is with Sony products lately? I had this for a little over a month and it just stopped working. Fresh batteries made no difference. For $50, I would expect better. Quality seems to be a major problem with Sony lately and I'm going to avoid ALL their products from now on. It's a shame, as they used to be high quality."
4,Shower radio,"The SONY ICF-S79V shower radio provides good reception on my favorite FM and AM stations and local TV and weather stations (in MY bathroom anyway), seems quite resistant to being splashed and seems to have long battery life. Three design changes I strongly recommend:1. Long-term experience shows that the most vulnerable part of this radio is the top surface membrane, which covers the push-button controls. This membrane is too easily punctured with a sharp fingernail. The puncture allows entry of water, which inactivates the control. Repair involves drying the area completely and sealing the puncture with lacquer or the like. A much tougher membrane is in order.2. The radio should use 6 (3 pairs of) AA cells rather than the (harder-to-find and more likely to become obsolete) 3 C cells it presently uses.3. A tone control would be very useful. Shifting the sound output to the treble end would improve speech intelligibility in many broadcasts."
1,"NOT water resistant, didn't last very long.",At first I had it hanging under the shower head where it would occasionally get a splash. On the 3rd or 4th shower water got into it and it quit working. I put it in the bedroom for a couple of weeks to dry out and it worked again. Then I put it on the window sill in the shower where it would rarely get water on it but it didn't last long there either. I let it dry out again and put it on a self over the sink in the bathroom where it would never get wet but apparently the steam condensed inside it because there was water in it again (I could see tiny little drops on the inside of the display). After that I threw it a way. Needless to say I was very disappointed in a Shower Radio I couldn't even keep in the bathroom let a lone the shower itself.
5,Perfect,"Exactly what I was looking for in a shower radio. The ease and convenience of digital tuning from Sony. Gets all the stations I want without any static and I'm able to switch at the push of a button. I've had mine over a year and only had to replace the batteries once so far. I only have one very minor complaint. The tv stations don't seem to come through nearly as loud as the radio stations, so they require the volume to be turned way up. Even with that minor flaw, I love it."
5,The best,"It is nice to have finally obtained something that really works as it is claimed to do. I have tried other such radios in the past and they have all had their shortcomings, but this Sony product performs very well, has great reception and sound qualities and covers all the bands you want...am, fm and tv. If you want something that you can rely on, buy this radio!"
5,Great Sound in a Small Shower Radio,"I've been looking for a small, water resistant radio with good, clear sound (and digital tuning) to replace a big clunky radio that I've had taking up half my bathroom counter. I read many good reviews on this radio, so I ordered it. It has great sound and is quite compact. I'm really pleased with it. Now I'll just have to see how long batteries last in it. Other than the unknown battery life, I HIGHLY recommend this radio!!"
5,Great Radio,"I have purchased 3 of these radios, one for myself and two as gifts. Great reception and extra long battery life. I actually don't use mine in the shower but it sits in a window in bathroom."
3,"Some good, some bad","This is a fairly nice radio for my bathroom, which has very little space and no wall outlet. It would be nice, though, if the radio had the option of plugging it in when it isn't used in a shower. The little wire antenna also is not getting good reception. When I can get the suction cup to stick to the window, it's pretty good, but it won't stay put for long. Even with the wire fully extended to an upper shelf, the radio station cuts in and out as I move around in the shower, which is across the room. I'm sure I'll appreciate it more the next time we have a big storm and power outage. All in all, it's rather expensive for a less-than-perfect radio."
5,The Best Shower Radio - EVER.,This is a great product. We've had other shower radios but nothing as easy to use as this one. The push button selections and presets have made everyone in the family happy. No problems with the reception and there is no more trying to adjust or find radio stations. Luv it!
5,A must if you like news radio in the morning,"I've always listened to news radio in the mornings and I like to take long showers. This is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower. I've had it for over 2 years now and it has been through just 5 batteries. It comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the shower's wall and reception is amazing. Buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local TV stations so you get the audio. Sometimes I do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise, but I never go more than half way up. This shower radio is excellent, get it now."
4,Awesome shower radio.,It works and it is one of the only shower radios out there these days. The stations come in quite well and we keep ours IN the shower with us. Its easy to use. I'd recommend it to anyone for a great shower radio. It was a wonderful wedding present - one of our favorites for sure!
3,"good reception, but not a weather radio","I bought this radio for my husband for Christmas so when he gets ready early in the morning for work he would have something to listen to. The added bonus is that it had the weather bands so he could check out the weather, since when he wakes up it's still dark out.I live in a suburb just north of NYC. The weather presets dont work at all. The reception on the radio is good even on the FM stations. The one touch presets are a nice feature.Tonight we have a heavy snow warning and the weather presets still dont work! For a radio its fine, but overpriced, since that's all it is in the NY area."
5,Bathroom Radio,We purchased this radio for our master bathroom. We had a radio in the bathroom previously which did not function. We were not sure of the reception that we would receive with this product. So far it has done what we would have expected. It was worth the purchase.
5,A Shower Radio to Tune Into,"Nov 2011Wow, it's been over five years since I purchased this radio, and it's working great and on it's original batteries! Well worth the investment. LOVE it!Nov 2006My cheap shower radio finally failed and I was in need of a replacement. I took the chance to significantly upgrade on this radio and it has been worth every penny! I love the reception, the sound quality, and convenience of use. The pre-set buttons are wonderful so I can easily switch between channels. I especially like the count-down timer which automatically turns off the radio after the time period I select."
4,Great Product,I love this shower radio. I have two of them in house and I'm always using them. Really a great product.
4,"Great, But Warranty Sub-par","Great radio, but I had to get warranty service due to radio flooding.Terms: You pay for shipping to refurbished product center; you get a refurbished radio back."
1,Poor Quality for a Sony product,This radio has very poor reception where my other radios have great reception. Even my favorite strong signal talk show station came in as a spanish language station. Very disappoining for a Sony product.
5,Great shower radio,"We love this- sounds much better than our old shower radio- a little larger, but a solid sony product. The buttons are easy to figure out, has a auto shut off timer, and I like that the fact that it turns off with a button and not with the volume knob. Our old one would get turned down but not always off so we would go through batteries quickly. I imagine the C batteries will last quite a while compared to the AA batteries our old one used."
3,Good sound but not long lasting,Just tossed my third Sony shower radio----lasts between one and two years with daily use. Good sound for sure but I'm done with this concept; somehow shower steam and electronics just don't make sense
2,"Great radio, as long as you keep it dry","I gave this shower radio to my wife for Christmas. The reception was great, picking up our favorite AM,FM and TV stations even without extending the external antenna. After only 5 days in the shower however, both the clock and radio stopped working and I could see water in the LCD window. This unit is NOT water resistant and should not be advertised as such. It may be OK to use in the bathroom but should not be advertised as a shower radio because it will not tolerate exposure to even small amounts of water."
4,Does the job!,"I really like this shower radio, the stations come in very clearly. It's easy to use, too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is that the buttons are on top. My shower is in a claw foot tub, with a wrap around curtain. The only place to hang the radio is on the curtain rod, so this means it's up high. This makes the buttons a little hard to get to. Luckily, I know which ones are which without looking, but it would have been a better design if the buttons were on the front. If you have a little shelf or something to put it on, you'll be better off, and really, my complaint is minor. The sound is worth the trouble."
5,shower radio,"This product is great! I got one as a gift and it lasted for over 7 years. When looking for a replacement, I didn't see anything that had the same options that was as reasonably priced. If you don't want to waste batteries on a CD player and only need the radio, it's a great choice. I've used it even while gardening, or other rooms in the house beside the bathroom. Batteries last several months, so it's cheap to use on a daily basis."
5,Sony ICF-S79V Shower Radio,"If you are looking for a shower radio, this is the only one you want. Don't waste your time, money and effort on any other shower radio like we have, just shell out the extra bucks and get this one first. It will satisfy your audiofile needs and will be the last one you will have to purchase. Outstanding quality & clarity of sound for such a small package. Has multiple pre-programmed channels, easy to use knobs and buttons, and sits very stable on the side of the tub/shower. Is worth every dime I paid for it and then some."
4,great little radio,this is a great litle radio for the bathroom or kitchen. Although I don't think its as waterproof as it says but i don't intend to try and find out!Small compact and perfect I would recommend it to anyone. I actually sort it out as my old roomate had one and I wanted to keep it in the bathroom after he left.
5,The Best!,"If you've been looking for a good shower radio, STOP HERE! This one is the best! Easy to use/see buttons and the sound is pretty darn good. I love the automatic timer. Press the on button a couple of times and it will automatically turn itself off after 30 minutes. I love it!"
2,Quality of the Shower Band Radio,"When my first Shower Band Radio seemed to no longer tune accurately I ordered a new one only to find that the old one would function if I deployed the antenna, which was formerly not necessary. While setting up the new radio I was reminded of the unecessary complexity of tuning the stations. This is a major drawback to the use of this radio. If another such radio were available on the market for a reasonable price this Sony model would be outclassed."
4,Sony Shower Radio,Having the electronic presets is a huge plus over other shower radios. Sound quality is just okay.
5,Love it. Had to buy an extra for my son.,Have been using my Sony shower radio for nearly ten years. Just bought another for my son because he kept taking mine and wasn't putting it back.
5,Great radio for the bathroom!,"No need in me going thru all of the features... you can see them in the product description.A few things that are important though before you purchase a radio for your bathroom.1. Make sure it has a digital tuner. You want to know you are on the right station and you don't want it to drift.2. Get one that has a large battery capacity.3. Ensure it has a power-off timer. You don't want to have to remember to shut it off when you leave the room.As far as reception - mine picks up great! (even without the antenna extension)This unit has all of these features, plus many more. I think you will be very pleased if you purchase this unit - I know I am!!"
5,Good radio with good features,"After having several cheapo shower radios in my life, I decided to spend a little extra money on this one. It was definitely worth it. The pre-set stations allow us to push a button to tune in our favorite stations for each member of the family. No more having to stop and dial tune after some one else listened to it in the shower.The unit seems sturdy and has held up great so far to the shower splashes."
4,Super Radio,"Great sound, stations come in clear, including AM, which can be a tricky band. The presets are super, just like being in your car.My only criticism is the weather button, which does not come in clearly often and sometimes not at all. I will admit I have not completely ""unfurled"" the FM antenna, because I move this radio often from the shower to the vanity/sink area and don't want a foot of antenna wire to deal with."
4,Very nice radio,"Looks great in my bathroom - unobtrusive. Sounds good. The only negative I have is the antenna. It doesn't provide very good reception. I can't get one of my local tv stations to come in, nor can I get my favorite radio station that's broadcast from 30 or so miles away (I can get it from any other radio). But most everything else comes in clearly. They could put a more powerful antenna on this radio and it would be perfect."
4,Sound quality is pretty good and radio reception is very good,The sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good. Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas. I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations. Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio.
3,"Good Sound, Good Features, but it Broke","I really enjoyed this shower radio. It sounds great, it has a digital tuner with many presets, and it gets good reception. But, after using it for about a year it stopped working. Water had seeped into the back of the radio and caused one of the batteries to leak, and the leaking acid in turn had corroded a wire. I'll probably get another one, but keep in mind that this radio is not completely waterproof."
2,On our second one,"Seems like the nicest shower radio out there, and has a lot of nice features, but is not very water proof. First one quit working, and when I opened the battery compartment, it was completely rusted. It was hung on a towel rack at the far end of the shower, and didn't have a whole lot of direct water sprayed at it. I tried to clean it out, but I think too much water had gotten in and fried the unit. We ended up throwing it out. We liked the radio so much we thought we'd give it another chance and purchased another one. The second one started to have the same problem. I cleaned up the battery compartment and let if air out for a few days and it started working again. We now only use it on the bathroom counter. I still think it's a nice radio, but not really worth it if it can't be used in the shower. I think if the battery compartment cover had a better rubber gasket, and was able to be tightened down, then it would be perfect."
2,Doesn't last long,"It's a real hassle entering the stations on this radio, and the sound isn't great. This radio lasted about 10 months. Then it stopped working and when I opened it up to change the batteries, there was corrosion all around the battery heads, and I threw it away."
4,Great Metzger Release,"I've been a fan of Radley Metzger since I saw 'CAMILLE 2000' back in the seventies. This film may not please fans of Metzger eroticisms but it shows a mature film maker at his best when confronted with good material. The 'EVITA' legend gets an interesting upgrade and Metzger uses his cinematic power to bring it to fruition with a powerful performance by Kruger. Fans of Euro Horror will be pleased to see Matt Damon and Anton Differing popping up within the tangled web. Don't get me wrong, Metzger spices things up with some erotic moments of which he is known for but this film is so much more. The quality has average sound with some scratches and splices at the reel changes but why quibble? Here is the maestro with a different twist and I do no one thing about a Metzger film, it is never disappointing."
3,A minor cult movie.,"I like Christianne Kruger so I took a chance and bought this one. I didn't expect much and so I wasn't disappointed much. This is more of an art film. Good photography as these things go, but a murky plot and a lot of artistic pretense. Buy it for the photography."
5,Great Conditions and Great information,"I'm an exercise and wellness, and a health promotion major student and this book is awesomeGreat Conditions and Great information"
4,Play Ball!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from an adult's perspective. I enjoy baseball a lot, especially when it comes to women playing ball. If you're interested in learning about the AAPGBL and enjoying a trip back in time then Sue Macy's book is a good read!"
5,"Good read, lots of references to followup.","This was a good read, short and full of great information. Lots of references to followup on. In fact, we intend to visit the museum in South Bend, Indiana on our vacation this summer where they are supposed to have the largest collection of AAGPBL materials. Met one of these gals this winter in Florida and found her very interesting and fun to talk to. She gave us her card and autographed it for us and we took a picture with her, too. A great baseball fan like me. If you want to hear how it all started and a lot of inside info, this is a good book for you. Spells out the climate for women during that time pretty accurately, too. Thank goodness times have changed. But we still don't have women making millions in baseball."
4,Cardigans for anoraks,"If you're reading this you probably know already that The Cardigans' career is one of pop's treasure trails. For me, there are two essential tracks here. This version of 'Higher' wraps simple pop optimism in uneasy desolation: in my opinion, this ambiguity characterises the Cardigan's more mature work. I rate this 'Higher' a sraight upgrade to the album version. 'Hanging Around' is here transformed into something deeper, rumbling and menacing - another Cardigan characteristic found in, for instance, the outstanding later track 'Godspell'. I can just about put up with Junk Of The Heart, here given an aimless disco makeover pushing it into musak territory."
4,"Useful for collectors, and for time-travelers, too","If you are out to collect gas-station artifacts this book will be useful in that it shows photos of a myriad of pumps, pump globes, petroleum product containers, and signage, along with price ranges. However, the display of 137 historic gas-station photos suffers from rather muddy reproduction on matte-surface paper that prevents showing the detail to be found in the original glossy prints. (On slick magazine paper, I've seen many of these same photos come to life. Why any photo book is printed on anything but slick paper is beyond me.) Despite this, the sheer volume of stuff and the text outlining the history of gasoline merchandising should be enough to engage the imagination of highway travel fans."
3,Seems Dated,"Healing through the Dark Emotions: The Wisdom of Grief, Fear and...This book makes very good points about working through the dark emotions and I found what it had to say veryrealistic based on my 30 years of experience. However, there is so much neurobiology and science that affects the emotionalsystem I was disappointed to find none of it present in the book."
5,A striking new view of 'dark' emotions,"This book is beautifully written, moving, and passionate. Greenspan's basic idea is that if we mindfully experience grief, fear, and despair, we will heal our pain and discover some fundamental truths about life. She tells her own story, stories from her clients, and engages in deft cultural critique of our emotion-phobic culture. She also situates our personal emotional experiences in a wider culture, developing a brilliant and original 'ecology of emotion.'You won't forget this book."
5,This booked helped me,I am a 9/11 survivor and this book really helped me accept my feelings rather than judging myself for having them. I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com.
3,nice military SF with too many coincidences to further the plot,"I enjoyed this book but felt a number of plot elements were too obviously contrived to be credible i.e. maintain suspension of disbelief that reading fiction is. The vitrians appearing and the subsequent revelation of their commander's involvement with the special third party, the various flashbacks in gaunts life to explain how he got an item he was about to use in the story, etc.Ignoring this, this is a fun book. I hope the plot elements clean up in later books in the series. I know abnett can write a good plot out, because the eisenhorn books are excellent."
4,a good book for a Warhammer 40k fan,"The book is a good read and one you'd probably recomend to a friend. There isn't much to criticize about this book. It's excellent light reading material, if anything it was sometimes too light in my thoughts. I enjoyed it enough that I'm continueing to read the series."
4,FIRST AND ONLY IS JUST THAT - ORIGINAL!,"This is one of over half a dozen new novels that is based on a role-playing game that I do not play but looks interesting because of the artwork that captured my interest. Then I saw the books and decided to try one and I was not let down, but pleasantly surprised to read Dan Abnett's very detailed and colorful characters and world building novel. I felt like I was reading a futuristic dirty dozen! The characters are many and very well done, better than most action-based sci-fi novels, and the storyline was actually very good and there were a couple of pleasant surprises to boot! I love this new universe opened up to me and will read and review all of them. I am looking forward to part 2 ""GHOSTMAKER"" coming out in september. This is a must read if you like action sci-fi that is well written. Thanks Dan"
4,An Excellent Piece of Military Science Fiction,"If you are interested in the Warhammer 40k universe, this is the book to start with. The action in this book is intense. The scope of the world increases as the story moves forward and the reveal at the end is quite satisfying."
1,A Glorified Battle Report from White Dwarf,"This book is nothing but a more detailed battle report from Games Workshop's White Dwarf magazine. I was incredibly bored after the first 90 pages, which is basically a huge battle, but was encouraged afterwards when there was actually some character interaction. But all my hopes sank without a trace when the huge battles began. It's a shame because the basis of the plot, a robot STC, is such a good idea. Dan Abnet should stick to doing what he's clearly best at and that is writing comic books.If you want some excellent science fiction then please buy a book by Isaac Asimov."
2,War glamorised to promote a game,"This is a very poor science fiction novel that is clearly and blatantly promotes war to sell Games Workshop products. I urge anyone who wants to read good sci fi to stay well clear of this book. The plot is unreqalistic (to say the least) as we see smaller numbers win out in every battle. Why? They are the good guys, of course. Battles have been made gory just to be glamorous, the writing is immature and there is nothing to keep you hooked.Non-40K players should steer clear of this, it will have nothing for them. However, it will no doubt go down well with the hordes of teenage kids who buy GW products."
5,one of the best Playmates ever,"I love Heather! Why? She is charming classy blonde, with a beautiful face, great figure, and a stupendous pair... I love to view over and over again. And you get to see them quite a bit on this fantastic video. An early scene has her completely naked on the streets of this small town, waving to a truck going by, riding on a fire truck, riding in a convertible with fully clothed guys. I truly adore it when Playboy has women outdoors nude with non-nude people, just strolling down the street.Lots of other great nude scenes too. A fun Little Red Riding Hood sequence, a really good one to show off her tremendous assets. Another is a music video style montage, a tribute to Marilyn Monroe, simply fantastics. When she poses nude near the director's chair or that old-fashioned camera, ah! Heather is a true babe and a classy lady, this video is a must-buy for all Playboy fans."
5,"Playboy Centerfold 1999 ""Heather Kozar""","Heather Kozar is one of the mostbeautiful Models in the world...Her smile and body tells it all...You have to go pretty far to find amodel with ""Heather Kozar"" beauty...What a model and when she was on,""The Price is Right"" She lit up thestage...*Best of Health* and ""HAPPY HOLIDAYS""to ""Miss Heather Kozar""...My wish is to have a signed autographof Heather Kozar, that I can frame andhang in my office...Nick Juliano (New York Giants)215 High St.Apt.1O11Wilkes Barre, PA.187O2-4341""Thank You"" *Best to All*"
2,Abandoned! Right away!,"I could not get through the first CD of this program. This program includes two students who are learning the material along with the customer. I found their participation annoying and interferring. It slowed me down. I found that I became more of a listener than a participant. Therefore, my learning experience was hindered.The information seemed scattered, unstructured; and Michel Thomas' gruffy voice was irritating. Petty stuff? Maybe! But, I just could not stand it!"
2,Not what you think!,"This book is entirely aimed at folks moving to Portland from outside of the US. It contains maybe the briefest amount of information about Portland itself, but is mostly focused on adjusting to American customs and our ""way of life"" (which actually, was a bit fascinating to read).Overall I was disappointed since this book does *not* contain a great deal of Portland-specific info. It's probably my own fault for not reading the editorial review closely enough, but I wanted to make sure that this information was clear to others!"
4,Worth your time,"Mcmanus, lead pastor of the Mosaic in Los Angeles, issues his challenge to reclaim Christianity from the clutches of organized religion. This is an excellent book worth the couple of hours it will take to read it. The book is conversational and very pastoral in tone but offers some unique perspectives that were challenging to me as a vocational minister. McManus pleads with the church to recover the ""Barbarian"" ethos that characterized the apostolic and later New Testament age and made Christianity into such an awe-inspiring counter cultural movement. McManus and his Christian community, Mosaic, exhibit many of the values that characterized the early church and are providing a tangible witness to the power of barbarian christianity."
2,I could not finish the book,I could not follow what the author was writing. I found some of the information interesting and other parts just confussing.
5,"Awesome, great book but controversial.","Give this to anyone who has been kicked in the guts by religon and longs for a better understanding of Christian Spirituality.This book really unsettled me, but finally someone has spoken about the idea of true faith,and the Author - Erwin R Mcmanus is not a ""minister"" - so he is not limited by the fear of affending someone.What is happening is a sincere turn towards a reverential understanding of what it means to believe, serve others and follow Jesus without the pretenses & institutional idea's of structure Church fellowship which cause feelings of obligation.I remember reading this before Velvet Elvis by Rob Bell and reccomend both books 1 after the other. The Barbian Way looks closely at John the Baptist and even considers the doubt John encountered when he was in jail.Jesus never rescued John, the way John might have wanted or even expected Him to do...Erwin encourages us to think about what this means in our own faith.GS"
4,A Call to Live Life Boldly for Jesus,Somewhat controversial since people like to think of themselves as civilized rather than barbarian. A book that urges us on to live life boldly for Jesus.
5,An Excellent Window into Living for Jesus,"If you have always thought that there's ""more"" to being a Christian than just believing and attending a good church, this book is for you.McManus gives a unique perspective on living the Christian life without the ""tamed"" religious aspects of many churches. It's all about having dreams, purpose, taking risks, and trusting God.Far from being wacky theology, this book is grounded in Biblical principles. It's a short book and reads easily in just a few hours.I recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore their faith and expand their limits, but doesn't get into heavy theology, traditional ""teaching"" or the preaching/teaching seminars."
5,Awesome! Very Inspirational...and Very True!,"McManus writes a highly motivational book that motivates the reader to find the risky nature that God has given us all and join the revolution that Christ started 2000 years ago.The book challenges the status quo that so many North American churches have settled for. This book has me stoked and ready to stop playing church, release my barbarian nature, & join the revolution."
4,Live the Adventure!,"Erwin's straight forward style and honest stories made for a refreshing and encouraging read. If you want your life out of a ""churchy"" rut and back into God's adventure towards the world, The Barbarian Way is just the ticket.E. SANDRAS, author of ""Buck Naked Faith"" and ""Plastic Jesus"""
5,A must buy for anyone wanting to take the world for Christ,"What a tremendous book, I could not put it down. I have never felt so challenged to go to battle for Christ before. Get ready for an in your face look at where the church is and should be. If you don't like to be uncomfortable you may not want to read this. But if you want to be challenged to ""follow"" Christ then buckle up for this one. This book is easy to read and follow. Mr. Mcmanus once again writes so people can understand in plain english."
4,Very Very Fast Read But Worth It,"So last week I picked up Erwin McManus' new book ""The Barbarian Way.""My first reaction was: Yay! Erwin McManus has a new book!I'm a big fan of his. Good and challenging stuff. The last book I read of his, An Unstoppable Force, was amazing and resonated with a lot of stuff that has floated around my head.My second reaction was: Yikes! This book is $16.99? It is so short.That bummed me out a bit.My third reaction was: OK, it was probably worth $16.99. This is a great book detailing a lot of what his church is chewing on right now. Just know that you are getting a pretty short book, so don't be suprised like I was."
1,Weak writing,Just could not make it through the book it was so elementary. I read about one third and moved on to my next read. Philip Yancey spoke several years ago about the fragility of Christian writing. This book is a classic example of this.
5,An Uncivilised Review,"This book will turn history on its head if absorbed and applied.. We need more barbarians to capture the heart of what Erwin is sharing and start a revolution that will transform the civilised way things have become, that are counter-productive to the way outlined in the Bible for Christians to live. Couldn't recommend any stronger that if you're looking for a new life, read this book!"
5,Read This and Lose Your Religion,"I was given this by the pastor who wants all the men in the congregation to eventually read it. It is a small book so I started to read it before I left church. From the first pages I was completely blown away. Warning, this is not your typical 'Christian book.' It is the opposite. The author highlights how the early Christians lived, especially John the Baptist. If we are truly followers of Christ we do not belong to a denomination but to God. We are His workmanship and we best get to work. I could not put the book down and I hope you don't either. Please read this and let's ignite a revolution!"
3,"A ""ready, fire, aim"" approach","What this book does well is remind Christians that there is more to discipleship than church attendance or even mere intellectual adherence to Jesus' teachings. McManus tells several memorable examples of radical living and cutting edge faith. However, this book fails to point readers in any direction. McManus creates a buzz by heightening spiritaul desire, but doesn't show how this should be channeled. This book is like a coach giving an inspiring pep talk before a game but not offering any game plan or strategy for winning. I commend McManus for his passion and focus. While this book is sure to get many readers energized, I fear it will leave many readers disoriented regarding the next steps of projecting that energy."
5,I want to be a Barbarian,"I was in Zambia when a friend gave me this book to read. It spoke to me so vividly as I worked and served among the shantytown of Mapalo to people who see very little hope except for their tremendous faith and beauty of expression of that faith. I have spent most of my life wanting to ""feel like"" other Christians seem to feel, but never have. I have done all the Christian ""things"", but never felt like I had what everyone else seemed to have. This book made me realize that, in fact, I don't. I feel the love and the passion in a different way that makes me want to embrace all those who feel unworthy of the Christian church and religion. It has made me accept my faith and love in a wonderfully unique and accepting (of myself and others) way. I am so thankful to McManus for giving me permission through his book to accept and confirm my spirituality and to my friend in Zambia for sharing it with me."
5,Lust for the open run,"Warning: Reading this book has been known to fill one with a lust for the open road. After you read this book, you will feel there is Nothing to Do But Go. I loved it. Read it twice already.If you liked ""Return of the Mucker"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, you will love this book. Bwfore reading it,I suggest you get a copy of ""Songs of the Outlands"" and read ""Out There Somewhere"" and ""Nothing to Do But Go""."
5,Best re-breakable board there is.,"I have bought several different types of boards and this one by Century is absolutely the best. There's no padding so training is a must. Holds up for a long time over many,many breaks; unlike others that quickly loose their 'breaking strength'. I reccomend this board over any other."
3,Rebreakable Boards,"Product is great (used these in my Tae Kwon Do club). The really do hold up well.$40 shipping and handling to toss 2 prepackaged plastic boards (11 inches square, 1 inch thick, very light) into a USPS Priority Mail box and ship via ground service seems a bit excessive."
3,HORRIFICLY HILARIOUS,"In The Words Of Simon Cowell. Utterly Horrific... No Vocal Talent Whatsoever.. No pitch control, no emphasis, no personna or feeling behind his voice, just utterly horrible.. However I will give the man great credit for having the courage and guts to achieve what not many have done.. Despite the set backs, a horrible CD, but I do accredit this man for trying.. This is something to pop into your CD player for a good hilarious laugh to jolt your system, not for sheer entertainment.. William Still Bangs.."
3,Genuine and not Manufactured,"I'll keep this short...1. It's worth buying this if for no other reason to ""humble"" people like Brittany Spears who are nothing more than ""manufactured"" successes... that think they are indespensable to mankind. I'd love to see William Hung outsell the likes of her for that reason alone!2. It's kind of like the anology of enjoying listening to an old cowboy singing a song around a campfire... the old boy can't sing, but you still find joy in listening to his heartfelt renditions...I didn't buy this because I wanted ""polished crap""... I bought this for the reasons above."
1,What is this?,"What is this? William Hung gets a CD? Did the label even listen to him before signing him? I don't think so. The contestants on AI put so much effort into winning, or whatever place they got. WH simply sang bad and got signed. I gues now to get a CD you have to either sing really good or really bad, which isn't how it should be. These people are making a mockery of this man. I hope he doesn't go far."
1,This is an example of what is wrong with the music industry,"This is an example of what is wrong with the music industry today.Got to give it to Mr. Hung, he exposed American Idol for the mockery it truly is.AI is more about money than music. Vote for your favorite Karaoke singer and buy a million of his records.Mr. Hung is proof and the music industry is in shambles because of this.If you want to hear real music, go to any local bar and support your local musicians and you will find more sincerity in the music than with Mr. hung or AI.I will say this is one funny album and something tells me it was purposely made that way because no one can sing I Believe I can fly that terribly unless the purposely did it. I give Mr. Hung more credit than that.Buy this album if you want to keep listening to what the music industry wants you to listen to.Until another artist like Nirvana (Kurt Cobain) comes out and shoves all this produced garbage into the trash again."
4,AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!!!,i don't know what to say but it cracked the hell outta me: HAHAH...it makes me feel good cause like i feel as if i'm the next celine dion when i compare my voice to his... :) funny... very inspirational... XP
2,step up from Fantasia but sorry William,"This Cd is complete trash but hey look who won the American Idol so it don't surprise me that they would have William Hung a record deal when somebody like Fantasia can ""Win"" the contest.I give it a two cause it is better then the so called ""American idol"" of season 3"
1,pathetic,If you buy this album you are f**king stupid and shouldn't listen to music.Save your money for something useful like some earplugs whenever you hear this retard sing
5,This guy is an inspiration to us all.,"This man represents the dudes all over the world who can't sing a lick (myself included) but try their damndest ever time they go up to karaoke. William Hung admitted he can't sing, and yet he is loved by many all over this country (again myself included) I'd rather hear a guy like ""The Hong Kong Ricky Martin"" William Hung trying as hard as he can rather than someone who is just up on the stage ""cashing their check"" Keep it up William!"
5,Quite possibly the greatest album of the last ten years,"Seriously, the worst you can say about Bill Hung is that he doesn't sound like Britney Spears, Beyonce, the Backstreet Boys, n'Sync, or any of their thousands of insipid clones. In a world where the airwaves are choking with bland, overmarketed, soundalike garbage, Hung is a breath of fresh air.His version of Rocketman brought me to tears (and had me rolling on the floor) as the ultimate tribute to the work of Elton John, Bernie Taupin, and William Shatner.What the world needs now is Hung, sweet Hung. God bless this man who has the guts to go after his dreams despite his obvious shortcomings. He truly is an inspiration to us all."
2,It was funny the first time...,"But now it's gettin' old. Seriously, how can this album be rated #3 on Amazon where Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard - TALENTED singers - aren't even in the top 10? He sings terribly. As Simon would say of this album - bloody awful."
1,"""William Hung took the American dream and S*** on it!""","Pablo fransico couldn't haven't stated it better, I'm mean seriously, I'd rather listen to Cher than this crap. Totally ruining such classics like HOtel California.Im just get amazed that producers even let this guy walk into their studios in the first place. HOrrible just horrible."
2,"oh william, what have u done","first of all i think that william hung is the worst singer that ever touched a microphone, but hey that is just me. i do like that he is actually trying because atleast he beleives in himself. i think that maybe just maybe with a lot of work he might improve, but for now i have to give him 2 swmpathy stars. well earned bud."
2,"William, you should have Hung yourself","Oh man. I'm sure more than one person said to William Hung, ""They're all gonna laugh at you!"" Boy were they right. And we're still laughing. And never once were we laughing WITH you, William Hung, but at you. Was the fame worth it? Was the money worth it? This is like becoming famous through the Darwin Awards, or for being on Cops. Buying this album is just a silly thing to do. But go ahead and do it if you have millions of dollars and lots of time to waste. Go ahead, I don't care. In fact, I might buy it since I obviously have nothing to do, writing reviews on William Hung. God have mercy on my soul."
2,Very disapointing...,"I was expecting the best out of Will, but I guess that I was wrong. I guess he sounds better live. Either that or we never should have made a big deal out of his audition. He does have some inspiring words of wisdom, but our parents and teachers already have that job. He ruined Hotel California, one of my favorite songs. Now to the positives. He does have his famous She Bangs song and most of it is pretty funny and you may get a few laughs out of it, yet it all seems pretty old by now. His best songs are She Bangs, I Believe I Can Fly, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Rocket Man, and Shake Your Bon Bon. All the other songs are very disappointing. 2.2/5"
1,Not music,"This CD is not music, this is drunken karaoke. CD's like this are the reason people download music; so they don't end up paying $15 for cleverly marketed crap!I hope Mr. Hung lives a nice life from the royalties he gets when VH1 plays a ""song"" of his as one of the top 100 worst albums of all time."
2,It was different,"The first song is ok, the second was boring, the ones after that were not even worth listening too. Some of his songs show that he has improved slightly, but some like ""I believe I Can Fly"" just make your ears hurt."
3,William Hung! Why Not?,"Real sincere guy here, so he can't sing there was Mrs.Miller and Tiny Tim in the 1960's so why not William Hung in 2004. Go for it William! Have a ball."
1,Hurt My Ear,This is the worst CD I've ever listened. Why there's such a William Hung!? This is killing the music industry. Be fair to the rest who can sing. Please.
1,William Hung Sucks!,"This Album Sucks! Look, this guy has no talent! Everybody knows that, so why do we praise him for being funny? Nobody should get popular in music if they suck! This guy totally butchers the song ""Rocket Man"" which is a classic Elton John Song. This guy has no right to do that. I have no respect for him. Who does he think he is? Does he think he can have a musical career with no talent? He should not have a career. So, for the sake of music, don't buy this album! If I could give it 0 stars, I would!"
3,William Hung should stick to singing Ricky Martin songs,"William Hung's new CD is partly humor and partly tragedy. When he sings the 2 Ricky Martin songs you feel like getting up to ""Shake Your Bon-Bon"", but the other tracks on the album (especially) ""I Believe I Can Fly"", sound worse than a cat in heat.I hope when the Grammy nominations come in next week that his album is nominated for Best Comedy Album. At least I got a few laughs out of it."
2,oy vey.,"I can't helping thinking about Stephen King's ""Carrie"" when I think about Mr.Hung. It's amazing how simular their stories really are. An ugly duckling, lifted up to the lime light only to be degraded and humiliated for the amusement of the majority. This album is nothing more than a cruel joke. The sad thing is that Hung is completely oblivious to it. I think that Hung is the first of a long line to be victims of the ""American Idol"" craze. Perhaps they should just come right out and announce a ""Whipping boy"" category to their show. The winner gets to be the oblivious laughing stalk of America. As for the music. All one has to do is listen to ""She Bangs"". That can easily sum up what to expect from Mr.Hung. I have listened to the whole album and I felt nothing but heart felt pitty for him. to put it simply, Just ignore this album. Be merciful and pretend that it never happened."
1,Total junk,"You could take a man with no ears or eyes or nose, give him a dozen Heinekens and turn on the mixing machine and end up with something better than William Hung. Your all retarded, simply put, you all are an insult to any music that has ever been good, as is the Fox Network as a whole that promotes William Hung. You are all in for a terrible downfall that your totally blind to. KOOK"
1,Trash...,"He ain't got nothing. I never purchased the CD, but just listening to the 30 second samples of the clips on iTunes, I thought I could say something about this horrendous album. One, he's got the worse vocals ever known. Two, he says he ""sings from his heart""? WTF? Clearly when he's covering all the songs and don't have any musical talent, there's no way that he's really singing from his heart. And three, I think he's gotten fatter - there seems to be more fat on his big head, especially around his mouth. Clearly, this album is a joke, and he's a joke. We loved to laugh at him, but now it simply is annoying, and we want him out. And it's gonna be more of hell for us if he stays in the music business and keeps singing. No one in the world wants to hear him sing anymore: it would annoy us to death and destroy the human kind. Maybe he's the next meteor..."
1,Now where's the sub 0-star rating choice??,"Absolutely the worst music ever released on a CD album. It was funny at first, now it's pathetic. A disgrace to the music industry to have William Hung published."
1,Can I give 0 star???,"You can help the music industry by NOT buying this product. If you insist on buying it, please treat it as a comedy album. This boy deserves a laugh but not a #3 selling CD. Wise up folks. Spend your money wisely on something else. WH's 15 minutes of fame is long gone. Give him a chance, don't nurture his ""talents"". Let him finish his studies. Stardom will ruin his future."
1,A DISGRACE TO MUSIC!,"How anybody could sit through William Hung is honestly beyond me. Why anybody would spend $[...] of their hard earned dollars on this is beyond me. I mean, honestly, if you all ""enjoy"" listening to William Hung, why don't we all enjoy listening to, perhaps, the lady singing in the shower? I mean, come on!And this whole record is just embarrasing. I felt like I was going to vomit after hearing his version of 'Hotel California.' And listening to him butcher Elton John's classic 'Rocket Man'? One of the worst versions of a song ever recorded.Do not buy this and encourage William Hung to put out yet another record containing more of this crap. He reminds me of an artist that's had his/her 15 minutes of fame, but wants to extend the time to 30 minutes.NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,No Love for the Asian Nerd...,"I have nothing against William Hung. Anyone who does is unjustified. (...) Complain about how he has no talent, insult him for his looks, sense of style (or lack of), or whatever else you can think of all you want. Who really cares? Hung comes out and says ""what, this is me, so what, what you gonna do?"" I can only respect him for that. People who hate him are jealous or have very low self-esteem...I have not listened to the whole album, just like 580 of the 600 reviewers on Amazon.com. From the portions that I have heard, it really is not that bad. Especially considering the crap in mainstream music these days. That said, I would never actually spend money to buy this CD."
2,"Funny, through track 1","But once you get beyond this guy's ""one-hit-wonder"", it starts to get really annoying. No, I didn't pay for this record - AOL had a free internet screening of the whole thing. I made it until about 3/4 of the way through the third song before his voice bacame unbearable. I doubt Apple would ever put this one on iTunes, but if they did, just download ""She Bangs"" and listen to it when you're drunk. The rest of the album, as far as I'm concerned, is just filler, to get an additional $9 or $10 out of people who think they have a sense of humor, or don't know they have too much money to burn. If you do buy it, good luck getting rid of it at the CD exchange. I doubt they'll even take it, knowing full well after Hong's 15 minutes are up, nobody is EVER gonna want to listen to him sing again."
2,Standard American Idol,"For those of you that want to believe that all it requires to get an album out is a dream and persistance this one is for you. You have similiar company in buying this album.For those of you that prefer the more rare talent, skill and genius to accompany dreams and persistance, buy something else and be thankful."
2,"He's ""Hung"".","Whether this is supposed to be a comedy CD or not, I'd still rather listen to it over any other American Idol contestant or winner. Of course, even after one listen, you'll probably wish that you were ""hung"". God bless America!"
1,What The Hell Is This?!,"What is this (...)?! This dude needs to take a (...) lesson in humility. ANYBODY with the right frame of mind could tell you this guy doesn't even deserve one star. Really, what is up with you people? The guy is extremely tone deaf, my A$$ could sing better than he can. I really don't see what is so special about this guy at all, but buying anything of his is a complete waste of money and time."
5,William Hung is an insparation!,William hung has started a new sport in the special olympics !Thanks for your soulful voice !
2,Not as talented as Pavaroti or Prince,"While it's true that William Hung is lot a better than, say Hootie and the Blowfish, Mrs. Miller or The Ray Coniff singers and it's also true that his album is more listenable than, say, Chinese Opera or that 2nd album that John and Yoko put out (you know, the one with 20 minutes of the sound of a washing machine, the one that came out right after ""Two Virgins"") I have to say that he is not really up there with the top recording artists such as Tony Bennett, The Dixie Chicks, Prince, Luciano Pavaroti, Beyonce, Lenny Kravitz, Ella Fitzgerald or The Beatles.In fact, if you're in the record store and you have to choose between Wm Hung and, say an old Steve Lawrence & Edie Gourmet re-release, go with Steve & Edie."
1,Whats the big deal,Whats the big deal. Its just a odd chinnese man singing rickey martin and other songs that he didnt even write. Its kind of sad.
4,Willaim Hung - A True American Idol,"Though he may not be the world's greatest singer, and he may not do the world's greatest cover songs, he has effort and drive, unlike many hip-hop and pop singers these days. William Hung is best known for being ""dissed"" on American Idol's tryouts by Simon Cowell after doing his rendition of ""She Bangs"" by Ricky Martin. Since then, he has become a pop-culture phenomenon. Just because he isn't a good crooner doesn't mean you shouldn't purchase his newly-released album. It's worth a good laugh, and it'll go to a man who ""already gave his best and has no regrets at all."" William Hung is a true inspiration to all of us."
1,Jonathan and Darlene Edwards anyone??,"This is the biggest joke since famed musicians Jo Stafford and Paul Weston, who were reknowned for being some of the most talented musicians in the business, released an album called Jonathan and Darlene in Paris in the late 1950s and won their only Grammy ever. You may be thinking big deal, right? Well, it was an album with intentionally terrible singing and terrible orchestrations, intended as a joke, yet it became their highest-selling album ever and won a grammy.Now we have William Hung. People are only buying this album as a joke. Give the money to talented people who actually have worked hard to become good singers. Lara Fabian, anyone?Go spend your hard-earned $15 on a Jo Stafford album instead, and I don't mean Jonathan and Darlene Edwards greatest hits!!! get something like Ballads of the Blues, which is a masterpiece. Or Judy Garland's Alone album!"
1,Pretty bad but..... better than 99.99% of the RAP thats out,"Everyone knows that this is just for fun. He'll make a few bucks, get his 15 minutes, and never be heard from again. It would be cool if more record companies put out a couple of cd's a year from unheard of people. I'd rather listen to Hung than that toilet music rap."
5,Haterade,"No matter what everyone says here or on any other forum, the fact of the matter is Mr. Hung is a rock star and he's making bank. More than can be said for most would-be critics. This dude cracks me up because he's giving the industry the ultimate middle finger. Now THAT's gangstah.So if you don't like it, don't buy it. Enough with this ""I haven't bought the CD yet but.....""You know what I mean, jellybean?"
4,You all need to lighten up,This isn't meant to be a masterpiece in case some of you didn't figure that out yet and it really isn't meant to be taking seriously (just so some of you know). And to the people trying to make this a racist thing all I can do is roll my eyes and wonder about your stupidity.Anyhow fun album and nice guy.
1,I don't understand,"I was over at a friend's house and heard this CD. I'm sure glad I didn't waste any money on it myself. I have no idea why anyone would want a CD by this guy. Maybe he did better stuff before this album but this one sure stinks. If you liked the movie ""Gigli"" then this is the CD for you!"
1,WHAT?????%%%%????,Is there anyone who can understand this and if by slim chance they can...i have an album that needs making.
1,Booo,Someone needs to seriously slap Hung in the face. He has already disgraced the Chinese American population in this country. I think it's time for him to stop acting like an idiot
1,Disgrace to music,Well sure william hung did get famous for having absolutely no talent..But is that what america wants to hear?...I dont think so..The album just makes great songs sound stupid...Which may get you to laugh a little...but thats it...it does nothing more than that...and my msg to all people is...PLZ DONT BUY THIS ALBUM...
3,Terrible - but how could I resist giving it to my brother???,"This is one of the worse excuses for ""music"" that I've heard, as we all know, but my brother needs to hear his version of Hotel California. It will be a great joke CD for him to play for his friends. It's pretty funny if you're in the mood."
1,Stop The Presses!!!,"I think I am going to vomit!! Blow chunks!! This album turned me into a twitching puke bag. His voice reminds of how it must have felt to be a prisoner of any war including Star Trek Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica (the one with Edward James Almost and his swagga) I gave it one star only because of the photos of my last New Year's party were threatened to be posted. This guy's voice causes shrinkage in the wedding tackle. Putrid music nonetheless. If you like buncombe, and the sound of bowel movement, you will love this guy's music--Biff Bingbong--The New Internet Gazette"
2,2 stars for trying,"I don't know who came up with the idea of signing William Hung up but it seems to have paid off. People are curious enough to buy his cd and enough people have bought this cd for it to debut on the Billboard charts.However, I cannot bring myself to buy this cd because it will do nothing but collect dust. No way am I going to torture myself listening to it either.Good luck William but I hope you go back to school and finish up what studies you are or were doing. I like you for your ""real self"" but just not your voice."
1,HE IS HORRIBLE!!!,William Hung is a terrible singer. I shouldn't even call him a singer. Do not waste your money on this album. Whoever got him a singing contract is wacko. If I could I would rate this a 0.
1,HAHAHA,"At first you know I thought it was sweet and all, I thought it was funny. But buying the c.d! 15$ on trash, you will regret it!"
3,HUNG OVER????,"I still think this CD is worth its weight in aluminum as a provider of comic relief. But I think Little William is about to experience some trying times if he wants to remain in the public spotlight. It seems clear that Koch records intends to lean heavily on William's atrocious cover versions of old pop warhorses. I can't see the same public accpetance if William's second CD is basically a repeat of his first. Also, I cannot see a widespread box office appeal for the movie William is going to star in later this summer, in Hong Kong. And the longer he remains in the spotlight, the more opportunities his truly strange parents will have to embarrass themselves. They have already created many a weird spectacle in the name of promoting William. They have even asked reporters to pay up for the privilege of speaking to William for five minutes. These sorts of strange demands do not serve William in the long run, and only raise the possibility of invoking the wrath of the press."
3,Only in America...,"If you like good music, then don't buy this album!However, if you admire someone seeing an opportunity and making the most of it, then do your part in fulfilling his dream!This might be worthwhile to play at a party after everyone is drunk out of their minds. It actually does have value in a comic sense.(...).I give it one star for the music, five for chutzpah, so that makes it an average rating of three stars.For those of you who make fun of William Hung or even pity him, you've totally missed the point.The guy's having great fun while laughing all the way to the bank..."
1,what are all you people smoking,"wtf are you serious. this guy really made a cd.yes, he was funny when i saw him on american idol but get real. this is just sad. he sucks at singing.he can dance and why the heck did he made a cd. what this world coming too."
3,Hard to describe...,"Wow! My ears are hurting, especially from Biliamos, I Believe I Can Fly, Rocket Man, YMCA, and Circle of Life. I had to give this CD 2.5 stars (even though that isn't an option) because, yeah it should get -5 stars because his voice is startling, but that is how it's meant to be. If it was supposed to be good, I would give it one star because it's terrible, but since it is supposed to be horrifying, it deserves 5 stars, therefore I went in between. It's just one of those things you need to have a sense of humor about. I did not purchase the album, but I did preview the full album on AOL. It is not worth getting. Throughout the album, Hung manages to forget words or skip over sections as well as mutilate the original versions of classics. During YMCA, Hung starts to accidentally laugh and either forget words or just accidentally starts to sing then stops. In Shake Your Bon-Bon, William Hung says, ""Shake it, baby!"" Just look at the Amazon sales rank. I shook my head instead."
3,---,"Hey it's no surprise, between the hip hop and William it's easy to see that american popular music listeners want music that they can sing better than the artists that actually sing the songs. I find william to be a refreshing change from all the other crap. Don't buy the CD unless you plan on selling it 20 years from now for a lot more money than it's worth (even that's a gamble)"
3,Hung,"It has a good song selection, even if hung destroys most of the songs. The best one is can you feel the love tonight."
3,anything can happen,"No grumbling......Will Hung will find his way back home, working harder on his engineering studies when all his enthusiasm dies down. It's not his will to be famous in such an awkward way. Many good singers sure are jealous and get humiliated for all their efforts.What the hack! it's only a star game and Hung is just one of a trillion of the lucky winner. America is unique... anything can happen !"
1,The Funniest CD you could ever get.,Guarenteed for a laugh infact I may buy it.(...)[A] guy who has had 15 minutes of Fame will cash in off American idol he is so bad but also so funny.Atleast the dude is having some fun I say why the hell not.Lyrics 1/10 Production 1/10 Music 1/10 Style 7/10 Voice 1/10Overall 11/50 This maybe the worst album of all time but it is also guarenteed to be one of the funniest ever thats for sure.William Hung gives new meaning to the word being your self and this CD with soundsamples is an apsolute must for all.
4,Review On The CD,"Well, I can't give a '5' for someone who can't really sing,but hey, I will give a '4' for honesty, inspiration, andgreat effort into this album. Though his singing is horrible,I think he is incredible courageous to stand in front of America to be mocked.It is not easy to be in front of America and sing like (...),do you know what I mean? I mean I don't want to be knownfor that if I were in his shoes. I got an image and that's not singing garbage out of my mouth! This album is interesting witha spin of humor to it. Maybe sarcastic humor from my side of the story. Overall, I love this CD because of the meaning behind it like the content. It's truly unique from other CDs."
1,Absolutely horrible.,Save your $10. This CD is the worst piece of garbage ever.Will be used as a coaster in your living room.
3,William Hung- A genius?,"Seriously guys, lets analyze this entire situation...This guy can't sing, everyone knows it, his friends know it, and he knows it. There is a reason William is in Berkely...hes a smart asian kid. What he did was play the media and the game show ""American Idol"" to his advantage and used his negative and hilarious feedback to fuel his rocket to stardom. Like Eminem he purposefully makes himself a controversial topic (though not the same way as Eminem did) and gets free coverage. Genius"
1,"Oh, please!!!","One star is too high. This is a complete joke. Yes, he is sincere, but sincerely terrible. His enunciation is just hideous and his pitch just doesn't happen most of the time. I wouldn't waste money on this goofy, absurd piece of plastic.I would feel sorry for him, except he is actually going to make some money on this deal. Of course, in the world of ""reality"" shows, some people will do anything for attention. That's their right, but I sure won't spend my money on such stuff."
1,Donate your money to charity instead.,"You'll feel good and its a much better cause. Come 'on, close this page, and go to the unitedway.com website and make a difference in someone's life who really needs it."
5,William Hung rocks my socks!,"Like he says, he may not be the best of singers. But he's not godawful and he's so adorable---he tries his hardest and gives it what he has because he LOVES to sing! He's not fake, just trying to be famous and forgetting who he is. AND the remixes are actually catchy. I recommend this album to ANYONE who likes music."
1,"Run Alexander Hamilton, RUN",I'd rather burn a $10 bill and watch the photo of Alexander Hamilton go up in smoke than to boost the ego of this wanna-be. Did someone have to sell their soul to the devil to be able to market crap like this?
1,Stop giving this fool money,"what is wrong with you people? are all his fans mentally ill? this guy is a joke. this isn't tallent, this is BS. stop giving him money!"
1,I WANT TO SHOOT THIS MAN SO BAD!!!(not literally),"He needs to STOP!! STOP SINGING!! He's made my ears bleed once isn't that enough? He has made me realize what a complete farse (spelling?) the American music industry is. How can an UNTALENTED, UGLY man get a record contract? I am missing no point I know exactly what this man, no thing's, game is- to make money, and if you buy his CD that's exactly what you will be suporting, an UNTALENTED, UGLY man's college tuitions!!!"
2,Please,"I think William's lucky to even have a record deal. I think that those who call him dumb are just jealous that he is going to be rich. He may not be the best singer but he is in tune. That earns hi, a very low two stars."
1,No Hung Jury Here: Guilty of Musicslaughter,"Do John Lennon, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix have to come back from the dead and slap silly anyone who buys into this absurdity? WAKE UP! Recorded music was intended for MUSICIANS and masters of the musical craft, not untalented karaoke jockeys. This CD is a perfect example of the current mindset of the recording industry: Force-feed us the quickly and easily found untalented schmucks and label it as gold, instead of doing what their predecesors have done for years; going out there and actually LOOKING for talent worthy of the record label. In other words, would Heinz be proud to put their label on a product that was 100% crapola? I think not."
1,ridiculous,"I honestly want to kill myself knowing that this guy(if you could call him a guy) has a record deal let alone has actually produced a record already. Every song is a cover song its ridiculous that someone would buy this. There is nothing worse than this and people actually encourage him. Why don't you people who seem to love him do him a favor and let him realize hes the worst thing ever, and that is being polite"
2,Why All The Attention You Ask?,"The only reason this cd was produced is because the record lable saw he was on his 5th minute of 15....so they decided to jump on the bandwaggon and make money while they can, sooner or later they will drop him, and we'll never hear from him again, and he'll be made fun of at MTV Video Music Award shows.....watch, he'll probably show up on the next one."
2,My thoughts...,"Well, I believe that he's not THAT bad... compared to the soggy bags of crap that are all of the other contestants. Seriously, all of them sound the same, like singing in the same pitch, and a laundry list of other problems, not all songs must be sung the same way, but, alas, they all do it anyway: soft, slow beginning, high-pitched yelling in the middle (you can tell when this happens, because everyone in the audience screams like a bunch of as$holes during it), end softly. I realize he is a joke, so i give him 2 stars for being such, but i guarantee it won't last long. If you want funny, go check elsewhere, this is only short-term funny."
2,I agree with everyone else...,"If you heard somebody on the radio, and you HATED their voice, hated the way they sang the single, would you rush to the CD store to buy their debut CD just because the artist is a nice person? I completely agree that William Hung's heart and soul are both in it, but I think every person is sure to admit that HE CAN'T SING. He should've written a book or something if he was trying to be sweet - forget the CD. Honestly, I can't see anybody sitting around listening to his CD. As an aspiring musician/singer/songwriter, it makes me shudder when I see stuff like this happening - here I am a true artist, I write my own songs, I play my own instruments, but a guy who can't carry a tune in a bucket - AND EVERONE KNOWS IT - is cracking the top 40 and I'm not even getting recognized. It's time we stop trying to be cute and buy his records just because you feel bad for him. Save your $15 and go buy something worthwhile."
5,The Legend,"William Hung is perhaps one of the most prolific and understated artists of our time. His abilities, his vocal range, sense of style and charisma are only now starting to take the world by storm.Yet, many should discover his earlier recordings and bootlegs. I believe these will soon be comparable in significance to some of the first Hendrix sessions.Only an elite group of artists ever become legends and even come to be known on a one name basis; Hendrix, Lennon, Marley, Elvis, Jagger, Joplin, Kobain, and Hung. Yes, Hung! I say this because the brilliance of such a debut simply cannot be quelled by those nay-sayers and charlatans. They are simply cretins!Please buy this CD and support real, heart-felt music that is sung by the brilliant Hung!"
3,Humor Makes Up for Abysmal Singing,"Okay, we all remember William Hung as the ""She Bangs"" guy. But this CD? Even worse.It was funny enough to hear him on American Idol, but enough is enough. Why does he have to be a big deal?I must admit, he is a hilarious thing to listen to when I need a laugh.If you're looking for a good singer, I suggest looking someplace else, because ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and other good songs are completely destroyed."
2,Good Grief,"Yes i understand that this is a novelty record, well, the novelty's worn off. Please go back to school William. While i admire him for trying(hence the two stars) it saddens me that a record company gave him a deal, when he could be taking his college courses more seriously. It was funny the first few times, now it's over. Stop milking it for all it's worth, the cow's gone dry."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"At first you'll think wow he's funny. But after a couple a minutes, dont buy this you will be annoyed.All tracks deserve 0, but I can't give that rating. If you want a good laugh rent a funny movie or watch comedy central. I wish the whole william revolution end right NOW. COME ON $12 bucks for this stuff, NO WAY! All you will hear will be an annoying voice singing OVER AND OVER AGAIN. All I have to say left is ""NO ONE IS LAUGHING WILLIAM"".(please do not buy)"
1,STOP -- don't buy this CD!,"Save yourself some money and don't buy this CD. He sings to these wonderful songs that I used to like but after hearing him sing them, have lost their appeal. It's painful to hear, and I could barely make it through half the songs. The ""inspirational"" messages played throughout are severe BS and do not add anything to the misery that is this CD.Main point: I thought he was really funny on American Idol, but after buying this CD, I realize that I could make a better album than he."
1,"The only thing sadder than this guy are his supposed ""fans""","You guys are just sad. Is this what a record amounts too? Hey feel bad for me because I suck? You should feel ashamed leading this guy on. He sucks and will be dumped the second this terrible American Idol season is over. Calling this music is an insult to music. Calling this series of sounds and beeps garbage is an insult to garbage. You the consumer, are the reason why good artists don't get a break. Because atrocities like this are taking up space on the record shelves.Good music isnt a popularity contest. I weep for you America."
5,The Rebirth of Slick,"I thought that with the demise of music in the early/mid 1980's, that there would be no more Led Zepplins, young Elton Johns, or Cat Stevens. Finally, the second coming has arrived in the form of an admirable young force by the name of William Hung. His vocals are mesmerizing, displaying a passion that only a handful of artists have possessed in the history of music. His versatility presents a genius that may only be rivaled by stevie wonder or perhaps wolfgang amadeus mozart. This should be a definite buy for the true music lover. The title says it all, truly an ""Inspiration""."
3,Indescribable,"No amount of words can describe this CD, I recommend listening to it for yourself, or staying very far from it."
2,smart,"yeah sure this guy can't sing but give him a break. he's at least trying. and to all the people who said that he looks mildly retarded, he's not. He is in an engineering major which is amazingly difficult. i give it 2 stars for effort."
2,RECOMMEND THIS IF THERE ARE WORSE SINGERS THAN WILLIAM HUNG,"If you bought this album expecting the next big male pop star, then something is wrong with you.This album is not meant to be musically enjoyed whatsoever, but it definitely lampoons how low can the record industry go. There's been plenty of AWFUL singers like ENRIQUE IGLESIAS, WILLIAM SHATNER, and KATHIE LEE GIFFORD, who should have never gotten a record contract in the first place. But what makes William Hung different is that at least he makes you laugh.Yes, no need to say that this is indeed one of the worst albums ever recorded, but I can tell you for sure that there's been worse.Yet, for being such a hilarious record, I give this album 2 stars instead of 1."
1,As if the producer wanted him to fall on his face,"I've done a lot of studio engineering work with pretty awful amateur musicians, and you can make them sound pretty decent through filtering, pitch correction, and other signal processing.Clearly, none of that was done on this album. It's as if the producers explicitly wanted the artist to be a laughing stock."
5,My Homey Hung,"Yo what up. I don't care what anybody be saying about my main man MC Hung. He be the flyest, illest, most gangsta mofo this side of South Central. With the release of his first of many albums, Hung makes Ice-T and his posse look like a boy band.You get some ill cuts all over this disc. 'Hotel California' never sounded better. Now that it has a dab of Hung flava to it. The Hung version of She Bangs is the deffest cut you ever heard. Word up. The Village People's 'Y.M.C.A.' is the crown jewel in the jewel case and it's guarantted to get your party jumping.And just to llet all you playas out there know. When you alone with your honey, and you want to get your love on... Just play 'Circle of Life' in a candle lit room. What your freak melt in your arms and give herself to mad passion.There's a new word on the streets, and it is Hung."
1,Let's be objective,"Why do I get the feeling that a lot of the reviewers are rating William Hung himself and not his CD. There are just too many biased reviews out there, on both sides. My wife borrowed the CD from a friend, so I listened to it. I had to stop about a half way through; I didn't want to waste any more of my time. Instead of reviewing the CD myself, I just want to ask one question - what would a person who's never heard of William Hung say about this CD? Enough said."
1,You should be ashamed of yourselves,"This poor guy is being exploited while people stand around and laugh. You should be ashamed of yourselves. He seriously thinks he is talented and people appreciate it. Yes, I know he made $$ but still. . . if you're an adult, do not not buy this to encourage teenage behavior."
1,Horrific with a capital H,"If you are framiliar with American Idol you know exactly how bad this artist actually is, and will not be surprised to hear him butcher some perfectly good songs. I for one did not purchase this CD but i borrowed it from my friend... strictly for amusment purposes. After i got through listening to the first few tracks i turned it off and hoped that i would never hear something like this again.Bottom Line: he cant sing, and its remarkable how many people will buy a horrible CD because they feel bad for the author."
1,Do we have to give it 1 star?,"Really, who would buy this crap... other than a few friends or family?"
2,Funny.. but don't keep it on repeat,this album is a nice little joke and is good for a quick laugh but listening to it constantly or the whole way through may cause you to become suicidal. I suggest you convince one of your friends to buy it and just borrow their copy.
2,...,"This CD is...erm...interesting. Not exactly a chart-topper. Hey, if this guy can get a record deal, I should have two double-platinum records and be honored in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Not that I'd try, anyway...At least you can hear most of the lyrics."
5,The funniest cd ever,"Yes this type of music is horrible, the songs are horrible, and the william hungs voice is horrible, but it is the funniest thing ever. I wouldn't buy this but if I did, I wouldn't buy it to actually listen to this, just for jokes. We all know this is horrible, I can't believe william hung thinks we like his music. Like its inspiration or something, but this is terrible. I mean cmon, but I'd rather listen to this than any of the other crapy pop music. You kids should stop listening to that. And stop screwing around, you screw around to much"
1,Roy Chan and Hung need to get back in the boat,"""I mean, come one, give him a break. He's asian!""How the hell are you a top 1000 reviewer?If William Hung's album is fun and entertaining, then grinding the front of my face against a cheese grater while someone repeatedly splashes lemon juice onto my exposed flesh is the equivalent of a trip to a french circus.yeah, i thought it was funny watching this guy get laughed off while he blissfully stated back in a lisp with a retarded look on his face that somewhat resembled horror that ""he tried his best"". good attitude, but sometimes you need to stay on the ground and not get back up. seriously, some of us need to sleep at night.don't blame my hate for the guy on low self esteem because he gives you hope for your befuddling existence. it was funny, now it's annoying. unfortunately the damage cannot be undone like with furbies, pokemon, yu-gi-oh, and elmo so it's impossible to suggest we build a giant fire and toss him in. better revoke the green card."
4,bestdressed,"Let's face it - I find it refreshing to hear someone singing for the sheer joy of it - even if he is not the greatest singer. He has not been styled, primped, coached, processed and programmed by the bigwigs at some record company whose only purpose is to move units. William is adorable - you can't help but smile when you hear him. I think it is a victory for all of us who are just average - but still feel passionate enough about something we love to do it - even if we are not the best at it. And, further proof that we all love a happy ending!"
1,oh dear no,it's not william's fault that some record company wanted to capitalize on his infamous idol tryout just to make money off his humiliation. He should have just stuck to engineering instead of letting people laugh at him which is what is happening right now. No one deserves to be treated like that.
5,The joke's on me.,"I bought this CD as a joke because I really couldn't believe William actually was able to get a recording contract. Well, the joke is on me. When I heard ""I Believe I Can Fly"", I didn't hear a joke, I heard a man's soul and by the end of the song, I had tears. It made me realize something all of us want, but few obtain. A dream. William Hung believed he could fly, and not only does he fly, he soars. No, the vocal isn't pretty, but the soul behind that vocal is so pure, so honest it makes you believe you can fly too. When things get rough, I listen to a young man who is soaring higher than anyone ever believed, except himself. It is aptly titled."
1,Exploitation at its worst!,Don't contribute to the exploitation of this young man. What a joke! The worst singing I have ever heard.
1,William Hung-DO NOT BUY,"William Hung's debut (and hopefully final) album is the worst CD I have ever boughten. It was funny for the first five minutes, but then I was sick of it. I thought it was the biggest waste of money anybody could waste. The two songs that were the worst were ""She Bangs"" and ""The Circle of Life"". Hung is no Elton John or Ricky Martin, he is just a guy with a horrible voice who should never have been allowed to put out a CD. Dont ever buy this CD, you'll regret it...believe me.."
1,This CD really deserves no stars!!!,"This cd is so gay. words can't even describe how bad it really is. Someone would have to be pretty deperate to listen to something like this. It's not even music, it's just a bunch of noise and crap."
1,What ??????,All I can honestly say is this is CRAP. Everyone who takes this untalented reject seriously is an IDIOT. There is so much talent out there that is undiscovered and they give a record deal to this SACK of CRAP. He is so dumb because he does not realize that his record company is exploiting him.
2,he now has an album?,"i give credit for the guy to sing on american idol and for effort but damn, hecan't sing! he butchered all of the songs he sang, other POPULAR artists songsand then somebody out there decides to put them on a cd?! what a waste oftime and plastic. i feel sorry for the true artists out there trying to make it bigwhile this person makes it to the top in less than a month. this album ismore like a""i feel sorry for the guy for getting kicked off american idol"" kind of cd, this willonly work as a gag gift. >.<"
1,"Zero Stars, Just Like the Talent - Zero","Forget about relaxing. This guy's 15 minutes were up 15 minutes after he was booted off. There are literally thousands of talented people who would give their right arm for a records deal and this loser gets one for two reasons:1. He is a novelty, flavor of the month2. America has no taste and the attention span of the American public is all in their mouthIt just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. Every month it seems someone else is the next big thing. Today it is this jerk and tomorrow who knows who will be a hit.Whatever happened to real talent? It went out the window with America's inability to realize garbage and no talent when they see it. I can sing rings around this moron."
5,william BANGS!!!!!!!!!!,"Go and get yourself a copy. maybe he is not the best singer in the world, but heck, don't hate him because he is living his dream!!!!!!!!!!!!! think bout how many people still DREAMING bout their dream.We loves William Hung!"
5,OH WE LOVE HIM!!!,"I LOVE HIM!!! I WANNA MARRY HIM!!!Because William, you prove so much about the recording industry. You have a lot more talent that most singers do, (...)... Maybe you don't have the best voice, but you can sing in key, which is a lot more than most singers nowadays can do.And so this album isn't going to win a Grammy... At least it's somewhat subersive... The record industry knows it can turn ANYONE into a star and they just have done it again. But at least William is genuinly awesome and cool and has a lot more brains that most of us will ever have...Yay for engineers, yay for William :) I can't for for the follow up to this album... How bout singing some Tina Turner... rolling on the river :)jer"
1,You either love him or you hate him,"In iTunes, this CD is classified as ""comedy,"" so that should give you some idea of what you should expect. He can't sing. In fact, it's so awful that it's funny. You wouldn't listen to this cd for the music... you listen to it so you and your little friends can giggle at how funny it is to hear a dorky asian guy who can't sing. Most of the reviews here are either 5 stars or 1 star, so you either like laughing at william hung, or you don't. I personally know I'd be ashamed if the only reason I was making money was because people enjoyed laughing at how pathetic I was. This has clearly gone too far..."
1,I can't believe people are actually paying to hear this....,"Is our country so tired of our entertainment that the media has to make it's own entertainment by taking a guy who resembles all the stereotypes of an Asian male and making him into a 'star'? There is no way William Hung would have been made into the 'star' he is right now if he didn't fit into all of these stereotypes, but still had the horrible voice and attitude he currently has. I can't believe a joke like this can be taken so far as to giving this guy his own 'Story of William Hung' show to air once, massive publicity, a $25,000 check for a record deal, and huge sales from this record which is nothing but crap. I haven't listened to the entire album and don't plan on it. I don't want to waste my time and make my ears bleed. I've listened to the sample clips, and that's all I need to hear. I have no clue why anyone would seriously pay money to hear this crap."
1,Please make the humility stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I want this man's 15 minutes over with and now.I swear William doesn't understand that he is a joke. I think he actually believes he is good. When he comes to that realization the psychological damage will be done.I have listened to the tracks from AOL and I can't believe anyone is spending money on this. I am going to lose it if this album sells enough to eclipse some of the true musicians on the Billboards top 50 of the top 200 albums.Also, I really don't want to hear this horrible mockery music over my local pop station.Please William finish school and leave your singing to performances at your local karoke bar.If this CD can sell albums why can't any drunk off the street sell them.This is a mockery of true musicians or talent."
1,What the hell is this crap?,"The other night, I was just surfing the net and came across this album. This kid is perhaps the ugliest and worst singer in the history of modern-day music. I stil can't understand why I'm not even making 8 dollars per hour at my current job and this idiot with absolutely NO talent is probably going to make millions because people will actually buy this piece of junk."
1,a disgrace to Asians,"I don't care if he went to Berkeley, he is making a fool out of himself to get money. I hope he is having fun because I don't think he realize what kind of image he is giving to America. sure, people say that he is a ""confident loser"" WOW I AM SOOOOO IMPRESSED!!!!! but he doesn't realize that his image juss basically represented all the stereotypes against Asians. the hair style, the voice, the accent, the LOOK!!!???? it's message is bassically: Asians are only nerds and wannabes pop singers. there are plenty of better confident losers, just don't pick him. he is an idiot of even thinking of doing something like this. not to mention his retardness on American Idol, even my mom saw him she asked me if the guy has something wrong in his brain. I can't stand this guy and juss so ya know, I am not jealous because he is famous. there are plenty of famous guys out there for me to be jealous. I just hope William STOP doing these stupid things and give faces to Asians"
1,Get a grip folks,"I can't believe that anyone would actually spend money on this CD. This is British mogul Simon Fuller's way of exploiting Americans, don't fall for the hype. I hope William Hung stays in school and realizes that he's been used as a joke.To all music fans of the world: this guy and this CD are a spit in the face of every single musician out there who's worked hard and paid their dues to make a name for themselves. If you even consider buying this for one second, do your favorite artist a favor and buy one of their CDs instead, please."
1,William Hung-DO NOT BUY,"William Hung's debut (and hopefully final) album is most likely the worst CD I have ever purchased. I was hoping to buy a CD that was funny and bad singing, but after the first two songs, I was sick of it. Just find the songs online, but don't buy the album. It's funny for like 5 minutes, but after that it's just sickening. If there was one song that was the worst one he sang, it would be ""Circle of Life"" by Elton John. So in conclusion, DONT BUY WILLIAM HUNG's CD-You'll regret it...believe me."
1,YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING,"Either the music industry is a bunch of mean and sadistic people or their just going senile. Come on give me a break, if they give this guy more air time on the radio then the other contestants than there is something very wrong with this picture, but wait there may be hope for me yet maybe I can audition and get a record contract."
3,William Hung! Why Not?,"What a sincere guy here, no the singing is not that great, but why not William? There was Mrs. Miller and Tiny Tim in the 60,s.So now we have William Hung in the 2000's."
3,It's a good deal and not a bad CD at all!,"I bought the CD yesterday. I was so excited! To all those critics out there, just remember that William can sing. He needs to be more cautious about the songs he pick. I took a number of music classes and he is very much in tune to the music. However, I see people are making fun of him because of his accent and diction (clarity of English). I personally believe he didn't sound good on some of the songs, most notably Hotel California and I Believe I Can Fly. Also, I found that he is not a consistent performer in terms of balancing the music itself. Nevertheless, William Hung is William Hung. I expect him to improve over time (next album). The original song ""Free"" works well for him. That's all I have to say for now."
3,Willy is NOT making any money here. KOCH is getting rich.,"You cannot listen to willy without watching him at the same time.so this cd is not as enjoyable.However, those who think that Willy is going to get rich off of this are wrong. $25,000 is all he will get for this..... even after it goes platinum.All the earnings will go to Koch Records execs' pockets.Koch Records is merely using this as a money-machine because Koch knows that America likes controversial crap!..... kinda like the Passion of the Christ deal. $300+ million generated, and a buttload of negative reviews.The more negative the reviews, the more people will want to buy this. So...... let's all watch this CD rise to the top of the Billboard charts."
3,WHY ISNT HE IN THE COMEDY SECTION??,"All i have to say is that, if anyone of you bought this cd for music pleasure, its not a brilliant idea! If any of you were here to support the guy, good job. Just know that hollywood is here to bring this up William Hung to make some $$$. America loved him for his attitude, not his singing. I personally think its great that he got all this fame, i just think he should be a comedian, by singing all these songs. Buy his album for fun, not for pleasure..."
1,No,"All I can say is no. Hung doesn't sing any notes in tune, the backups (The Gonnabees) are not in tune either, and you can tell that the album was done quickly. There is nothing else to say. William Hung is just as bad if not worse than he was on American Idol. 1 Star."
1,We are a nation of morons . . .,"Surely this record is a sign of the apocalypse. This ""music"" ought to be used to torture all the prisoners soon to be taken in Fallujah, Iraq."
1,This is what the music industry has become,"What can I say about this ""music"" CD? When Morrisey and Paul Weller can't get played, or in some cases, even a record contract in America, and yet Mr. Hung is a ""star"", there is something seriously wrong. I watch a basketball game and see this young man singing, and yet I can't remember the last time I saw Radiohead on TV, but there's a difference. Mr. Hung is all hype, and in a couple of months when we're talking about Mr. Hung in the same breath as the infamous Gerardo and Right Said Fred, company he so richly deserves. So I say viva William Hung, do everything you can now, because my watch says 14:59."
4,Cmon people lighten up a little will ya?,"cmon people dont be mean to William Hung yeah sure hes not the best singer in the world but he is determined to make it in the music industry with his honesty, humor, and hard work. I am tired of other artists claiming that their album is the inspirational album of all time but they're wrong, William Hung's new album is truly inspirationalSo get his new album or you'll regret it"
2,"Bad album, great personality.","Granted that the album is not good and you could hear better versions of these songs at your local club. I think that the one thing that makes this CD special and Will Hung as a whole special is his personality. Coming from a show where EVERYONE thinks that they were slighted or should have moved on, he was the only one in three seasons that took what was given with descency and respect. ""I gave it my best and I have no regrets."", That's all one needs to know about the kid. The CD is not good, nor will he have another. But the attitude is what is driving the CD here, not the music. Our world could use people with attitudes such as this and not the attitude most people have these days. For the Attitude a 5 star for the music a 1 star. The ""Insperational thoughts"" made me give it a 2."
2,THE NEXT WING!,"If you have never heard of the singer Wing, you have to check her out. Hung and Wing are destined to become classics in the horrible singer category!I agree that Hung's ability to sing is lacking, and it is almost an slap in the music industry's face that he even was allowed to release this album; however, he has, and if you're looking for a laugh you've found it."
2,"At least it's not ""St. Anger""","Wow. Unbelievable.I used to think that there would never be another album that could possibly come close to being as bad as Metallica's crummy latest release, ""St. Anger."" I was wrong.However, unlike Metallica, I can honestly tell that William's heart is in it. He is trying his absolute hardest to do his best, while James and Lars, who are supposed to actually HAVE talent, seem intent on feeding their fans absolute CRAP. That's why this CD at least deserves an extra star, for effort.Ya know, if the whole pop music thing doesn't work out for Will, he can always join a rock band. Listening to the majority of new bands coming out lately, you really don't need to carry a decent tune to be famous. Just look what it did for Chino. ;-)"
3,An -A- For Effort,"I don't follow American Idol, but like many people, I had heard some of the buzz about William Hung.While I didn't buy this CD, I did take the time to listen to the samples and I must say, I actually ""Got it"".Does he have the heart of a singer? ... [Absolutely!]Does he sing well? ... Not quite, but then again, I could name quite a few popular artists who were never blessed with vocal talents. It all comes down to heart, and it looks like this record label has decided to underscore that theme by mixing in William's own words of inspiration along with the music. (...)Bravo William!"
3,NO...he cant sing but its fun,"Would I buy it no, but its fun to listen to...he is funny. I give it 3 stars not for the talent but because its just fun. He knows that he is not the greatest singer but he is having fun. I think that should count for something."
1,Truly awful,"I've seen reviews that call this piece of trash ""amazing"" and ""inspirational"", and claims that those who don't like it just don't understand it.People, this is not ""A Clockwork Orange"". There isn't any deep meaning to understand here. This cd is so bad, it brings tears to my eyes. And it isn't even funny, because despite the fact that he's so sincere and thinks he's doing well, the ONLY reason this cd is out is for people to make fun of him.Really, that's how low we've sunk as a society. We've gotten to the point where a record company will put up the time and money to sign a singer that people will point and laugh at. And Hung is so naieve that he doesn't get that this is the point of the cd; sure, sure, they sold him a line about being inspirational, but the whole point of this album is to make Hung a laughingstock. That's just sad.Save your money. Don't encourage more of this crap by buying this cd."
1,Obviously a joke..,I can remember laying down watching American Idol when William Hung auditioned.. it was soo funny! William Hung's CD is not to be taken seriously.. its more for entertainment. Anyone who hears it can realize that.
1,WTF!!??,Not only does this guy have no musical skills to speek of these songs do not even contain any REAL instuments. From listiening the samples it sounds like some guy just made all these beats and rhythms on his lap-top one night while he was watching jerry springer on tv. Anyone who pays money for this has got to be mentally challenged.
2,Painful,"I've been a William Hung fan since the day I saw him on American Idol. He's funny, and a great inspiration. They should have done a single. The first song, She Bangs, is the best on there. All the others are PAINFUL. You'll cringe when you listen to this. The notes are waaaaaay off. It would have been MUCH better if he had just realeased some $3 single. I wouldn't waste my money"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would put 10 stars but it wasn't an option. If i have 10 hands, i would give it 10 thumbs up. This CD is truely inspirational, i can't wait for the next CD. William is so sexy in that DVD. Yeah !!!!He is my idol."
4,The joke's on WHO?,"William Hung is so REAL you can't help but be drawn into the hype. The appeal here isn't his talent (or lack of)...it's his personal drive. He makes me believe that he believes what he says on the spoken word selections, much more than Dr. Phil or any of the other media talking heads can offer these days. So what if he may be the newest Mrs. Miller? I like her too! Keep 'em coming William!!!!"
1,Desperation,"That should be the true title of this album. Some people will just do anything to be famous. William Hung is not endearing or funny. It's good to know that most people did not waste valuable money on this junk. William Hung should just put us all out of our misery and out of his misery. Nobody is buying his garbage. If Hung were a true inspiration, he would go back to school instead of desperately trying to hang on to a few minutes of fame. Do people honestly like to hear old jokes over and over again?"
2,Buy this to keep people away from you.,"Welcome to America, where a guy who has no talent singing can become an international celeberity,wierd. I bought this album in order to keep my kids up with the new fad. I played it while driving to school to pick them up, the kids decided to walk home. So if you wanna keep your car clean buy this, other than that its a waste of money"
3,"Laughing AT him,NOTwith him.","I can honestly say that this CD made me laugh sooooo hard that I was crying! I have not enjoyed myself like that for such a long time, but it is a guilty pleasure because, I feel, I am laughing AT him-not WITH him. Because of my guilt, I have given this CD a 3 which is actually a compromise between 1(an absolutely horrible,untalented singer)and 5 (the greatest comedian in the world). Yes, this album should win a grammy for best comedic performance whether it was meant that way or not. Mr. Hung deserves all the criticism as well as accolades this CD will bring him. And while I may feel guilty laughing at him, ultimately he will be laughing AT all of us....all the way to the bank!(Can't wait for his video for ""I Believe I Can Fly"". I screamed throughout that entire song!)"
1,"If you want to waste money, send it to me!","I admit, it was funny on the show, but for someone to actually buy this? The fact that the Hung One got signed to a lucrative record contract is a slap in the face to all struggling artists everywhere.Is this what entertaiment has come to? No talents getting signed? <Looks at Billboard Top 10> I guess so..Lowest rating possible based on principle."
1,"He says"" I may not be the best""!!","Well I like him.He is funny and the look of him just makes me smile.And in the CD he says ""I may not be the best ""!!What is he thinking ..It should have been ""I may not have been the worst !!!"".But sometimes people like him inspire me ..and I have that hope that maybe one day I can also become a great singer !!"
2,American Idol deserves this,"Why is everyone so upset that William is getting his 15 minutes of fame? Don't blame William, blame American Idol because they are the ones responsible for this. Just for ratings, they put the most horrible singers on TV so we all can get a big laugh at Simon, Paula and Randy's comments and this time it backfired. Live with it America, William is getting the last laugh. No, he can't can't sing, no he can't dance, but he has that something that make you go, awwwwww!!! I said the night he auditioned, ""That guy is marketable"" and lo and behold I was right. This album is an album you would play at a gag party and quite funny to listen to. The best two songs are ""She Bangs"" and ""Shake your Bon Bon"" with the worst being ""I believe I can fly"" and ""Hotel California"". Maybe William can be the modern day Weird Al Yankovic, or just maybe he can make a living out of Ricky Martin remakes."
1,I'd Rather Smell An Old Crotch,"My My My, It's finally come to this. How can a person who basically looks like he has down syndrome, think he has talent? other than that to william i will say stick to engineering, but get some street smarts, not book smarts, then you would see what kind of ridiculous nonsense you have walked into. Besides that an Asian singing Bailamos? Isnt that spanish for ""we dance."" all i have to say is lets keep it spanish. I can't believe hwo freakin dumb people are to want this. I mean i heard it on AOL and laughed until i peed. It was dreadful and i can't believe anyone could want to hear this piece of flynt. I'd rather just go and play some Milli Vanilli, at least it sounded good. Well enough complaining, if you like garbage, you'll love this trash. anyways, as my sister says, That Guy from the American Idol is just wrong...WRONG!"
3,I just hope Will is in on the joke,"I just got this CD today and have already passed it on to several friends. I found it delightful and fun.Key ideas:(1) The inspirational words are GREAT! So very endearing. I wish I had William's courage to put myself out there like this.(2) William Hung is so endearingly awful. No doubt. No one will argue this point. He struggles to be in key and his pronunciation is cringe-worthy. Yet, it is his sincerity and openness that rise above the hypocrisy of the AI show.I hope William makes some money and then heads off to achieve other endeavors. I wish him the best of luck and thank him for going out on a limb when he ventured out to audition for the American Idol show. The kid's got courage."
1,Earplugs should be included!!!!!,"It's just amazing how low record companies would stoop in order to make money. I still can't believe there are people who give this 5 stars, these people should be committed! Sweet mother of God! This ""album"" is nothing more than a horrible screeching mess and a slap in the face to consumers. If Hung had an ounce of self respect, he would've never signed a contract with the record companies who are just there to make a mockery out of him, but then again he's just as horrible as they are, if you ask me they're nothing but a bunch of money hungry opportunists. At the end, this is nothing but an album about a person degrading himself in order to make money. This thing just leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, and it's an insult to any artist. It's not even garbage pick worthy."
5,Love his Sweetness,"William Hung is so sweet and good-hearted. Great song choices! I love the inspirational tracks!! I can't believe people can say anything negative about this guy! William, don't listen to them and keep pursuing your dream!!! :)"
3,Not Too Bad,"This Isn't Too Bad of a Album From Hung, But It's More Comedy Album in My Opinion, Because I'm Not Sure If He's Being Serious or Not. The Cover of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" is Good, R. Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is Good, The Eagles ""Hotel California"" and the Hit "" She Bangs"" by Ricky Martin. Overall, It's Better Than His Other Albums. If You Need a Good Laugh, This is Something You Should Buy."
3,William Hung Gets The Last Laugh,"I'll give it 3 stars because it's funny to listen to once or twice. But like any other novelty act, you get bored with it quickly. People can slam him with negative reviews all they want, but bottom line is....William's 15 seconds of fame probably earned him enough money to at least pay for all of his college education, and maybe even his first house. And it wouldn't surprise me if you'll see him on a reality show for ""washed up stars"" someday, which will earn him a few more bucks. His musical talents probably won't make him a millionaire by any means, but my guess is that he'll be debt free for the rest of his life (large scale debt anyways). So slam him all you want. But in the end, William got the last laugh."
1,William Hung you're outta style,When is this guy gonna realize that he cannot carry a tune? I listened to samples of William Hung's debut album and believe me this cd is a joke and I DO NOT know why William Hung recorded a cd in the first place. Why I think this cd was put out was because William Hung wanted fans to enjoy his singing. So please avoid this album at all costs. And finally Mr. Hung I am truly disappointed in this album and i'm sorry to tell you you're outta style and would you please hit the runway
1,Hung over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You know the music industry is at an all time low, when they're signing crap like this.You people can't honestly take this seriously???!!!!The music business needs a boost quick!! No wonder CD sales are at an all time low."
2,"Good for a laugh, and that's about it.","Reality TV shows has given way to people having a good 15 minutes of fame, and William Hung is perhaps the epitome of that. After his embarrassing performance of ""She Bangs"" on American Idol, he was given a record deal, something that required no talent to do.With his fresh off-the-boat accent and off-key singing, Hung is perhaps as bad or worse than karaoke night in a bar. He is perhaps a humanized version of the Asian stereotype. Seeing that he has no talent, he can't even write his own songs, so instead he has to butcher classic (and some already bad) songs such as Hotel California. In this CD, he has preludes and interludes of him speaking words of inspiration, which do nothing but to inspire you to plug your ears. The CD could be considered a comedy record, because it might make you laugh, and that's why I say to take a listen to it, even though his 15 minutes of fame have died a long time ago."
1,Don't recommend it.,"Okay. Everybody thinks William Hung is a really bad singer. Everyone's right. Even though he wants to sing, he can't. It's like Don Vito from Viva La Bam wanting to model a bikini...and they'd make that an episode if they wanted to. William Hung may have had his 15 minutes of fame on American Idol, but I don't address that as fame. I'd rather address it as shame. Anyway, William Hung is the worst singer I have ever heard. Even though William Hung has ""presevrebrance"" --the way he said it on his album--he needs to do us all a favor and stop singing for the rest of his life--in the shower-preferably. You shouldn't go to your local music store and buy this album. Overall, William Hung doesn't bang in this album and I give it a mere 1 out 5."
2,Overcoming great odds to make this CD!,"I give this boy lots of credit for overcoming fetal alcohol syndrome to complete this CD. Putting aside the fascination in hearing a handicapped person put on display, I was able appreciate this CD for what it was. A challenged performer overcoming obsticle with ease."
1,...And Not Particularly Funny Either,"This is undoubtedly the worst recording since ""I'm Bad"" by Kim Fowley back in '72 and should immediately be relegated to thedustbin of a very cynical recording industry."
4,"William ""is well"" Hung!","...To be honest, I don't have this CD. I just thought it was funny how his last name was Hung. But hey, he may suck, but it's funny...kinda. Let the man have his 15 minutes of fame."
1,WTF?!,This is a joke right? You've got to be kidding. I can't believe they are allowing this guy to put out a CD when there are TALENTED people out there that deserve it but aren't getting credit for a darn thing!! If you all want to hear a REAL singer and an amazing voice pick up RJ Helton's CD 'Real Life.' You WILL NOT regret buying that one!
1,this is garbage,"I cant believe a hack like him has a recording contract and artists like Joe Brucato do not.Check out Joe Brucato for an artist with feeling and emotion and TALENT!!!Then figure out this cd is best for playing frisbee with.(PS) If you say it is good for comedy, save the (...)and go to a karaoke bar and hear them sing (probably better than Hung) and buy Joe Brucato's cd for far less. You'll thank me for it."
1,An embarassment,"This album is only a joke. Don't take it seriously. It's an embarassment to the music industry. It's a collection of William Hung's favorite karaoke songs, all recorded onto a CD-R disk over a microphone in that exact quality; poor. I thought he had a record deal?"
1,Wow...Music At It's Worst,Well I didn't buy this cd but have listened to it. I just want to say this is really sad the record labels would put time and effort into something that really shouldn't have effort put into it. This guy can't think let alone sing. So what makes it right for him to make millions why the rest of us struggling artist are looking for a deal. This is the most ridiculous album ever.
1,Unsure what is going on...,William definately gives hope to showing that we can have talents other than what other people expect from us. He has become the American Idol without all the stress of the TV appearances of the other idols. What a cheat - but that is the way show biz works - and life for that matter. Way to go William.I hated the singing though.
1,It's a shame this is what we've come to...,"It makes me sad to think that garbage like this is actually available to purchase. Is the music industry so lacking in talent that it's necesary to release an album that essentially makes fun of someone who can't sing? No true music lover takes William Hung seriously, and whoever was responsible for getting this album recorded only had one thing in mind - making a quick buck. Does good music not matter anymore? There are truly talented musicians out there who struggle for years before landing a record deal, and some never do. William Hung goes on American Idol and makes a complete idiot of himself and all of a sudden has an album out? I no longer need any evidence to say without a doubt the music industry is a complete and pathetic joke."
1,A Sad Joke,"It's nothing against the guy, but why the heck is this even being released? Are we going to remember him a year from now??? Ummm....no. He's just a poor guy who is being used. He probably does not even realize how horribly untalented he is and a mean-spirited public is taking advantage of it. People will not buy this album for good music. They will buy it to laugh at him so they can feel better about themselves. Talented people struggle and work hard in the music buisness for a record deal. For some it takes years and some people do not get one at all. William Hung makes a fool out of himself and gets one basicly overnight.William Hung....you are NOT an inspiration. You are a joke. A few months ago, you will be doing VH1 and MTV specials saying ""Hi, remember me? I'm the She-Bangs guy"" and you will wonder why no one cares. Thank you for ruining the music buisness even more."
1,poor man,this poor man was only given an album to be made fun of. poor guy. 1 star for the record company who released this.
1,William Hung What?,I can't believe they even gave this guy a record contract.He can't even sing at the least in tune.
1,why can't we have a zero star rating.,"I don't have this album. I don't plan on buying this album. The fact that this awful sounding man who resembles a billy goat on an acid trip, has become a star, is a scary scary thought.Everytime I see Mr. Hung singing I'm reminded of Rosanne Barr screetching the National Anthem,and Ozzy Osbourne's horrid rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"", both of which happened at Wrigley Field.Though I am a fan of Ozzy, I think he was horrible with ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"".Mr. Hung, and his fan base, are further proof of the downfall of the music world. The charts, fame, and money, used to be the product of hard work and talent. There was a day when people who couldn't sing didn't last. The list of these wannabe artists is just way too long to list.I guess the days of real talent, and real voices being the measure of fame and fortune are over in the music industry as we know it."
1,"Dont buy it, just dont, do your ears a favour","Gosh, he's the worst singer ever. Totally TONE DEAF... Well, if a buncha aliens comes over to earth, we could play this CD at full volume and they'll run(if they had legs) like they never did before. The only nice parts of this CD is the few seconds breaks between the songs. He ruined great songs by ricky martin... Do your ears a favour, dont buy it."
1,Get over it already!,"I don't know what kind of people who would go out and buy this CD. If there is someone to laugh at is the producers of this album. Much like the unbearable schreeching of a piece of chalk on a chalkboard. I bothered enough to sample a song from this guy and I just stopped short of screaming at Bill's rendering of R. Kelly's 'I Believe I Could Fly'.Okay. Fine. We all laughed at him. Ehen laughed with him. But a message to Bill and his father, how long will this guy go until he is completely humiliated?Buy this, if you really have nothing else to spend on. But even if you do go out and buy it, that just shows how much you know about talent.Jennifer Hudson!!! I love you!!!!"
1,Dreadfull,"I cannot believe that this album is no. 3. Awlfull, perfectly dreadfull. What a waste of money. Go back to being an engineer Mr. Hung. For one thing, who the hell can even understand what you are trying to sing. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk, what a disaster."
1,Hung sucks,This is by far the worst album that has ever been made! I dare you to find one that is even worse. It was a complete waste of money to make this album and I hope that no one wastes their money and buys this piece.
1,Who in the right mind would buy this garbage?,"Honestly...you people need to listen to some real music, instead of this rip-off crap!This is dreadful...Also with all that money he has now, he needs to get his teeth fixed...It looks like a shard of glass is hanging out of his teeth!"
1,NO INSPIRATION HERE....period.,"William Hung one of ""American Idols"" biggest rejects comes out with an album ""Inspiration"", and believe it or not has already out sold 2nd place contenders Justin Guarinis album.Why?...He has no talent, can't sing, needs veneers really bad, and turns these pop songs into sick, out of key, miserable sounds.Why? would I put this on my CD player to here Hung sing ""She Bangs"" or ""Rocket Man"" when I can hear the real thing from Ricky Martin or Elton John who have pipes.A waste of man made materials, money and time. William Hung I hope your five minutes are over because I am sick of hearing your off key screaching.You are a disgrace to the pop music industry, and somebody has made a buck off of you.GRADE: F"
1,At home in Asia's favourite genre,"William Hung is the mentally retarded Asian American winner of American Idol 2004. Everybody knows Asians excel at karaoke, so this collection of covers should be a hit. Of course it was and it sold very well, which means this must be a great album and I can strongly recommend it without having heard it."
1,You have got to be kidding me!,"First of all, anybody who actually spends money to buy this CD is smoking crack. This guy has no talent whatsoever. I love people that say he believes in what he is doing. Sure he does, he is stealing your money. I would believe in that as well. This CD is a perfect example of why American Karaoke, I mean American Idol, needs to just go away. Personally, I am going to wait until his greatest hits album comes out before I make a purchase. Nice going, Will. Enjoy the 15 minutes."
1,Shame on You!,"This just goes to show that the American people can be sold ANYTHING! How about some swamp land in Florida! I just hope this guy doesn't really take himself seriously. For those who actually bought this drivel, hard as it is to believe, I guess I'd say ""put your money to better use and feed the homeless."" It's really insulting to pair this albumn with any other serious performer and call it a bargain package. I guess you could listen to the other performers CD and use William's for a coaster!"
2,He's terrible!!!!! (But at least he's better than Underwood),"What can I say this boy can't sing. However, even he has more ""it factor"" than the ""fambotic"" Underwood. I still can't figure out why that girl won she's terrible. Constantine,Bo,Nadia, Vozell, and Jessica all deseved the title more the that girl. She probably only won because of Votefortheworst.org.Anyway had to atleast give him credit for that."
1,Painful - really painful,"Listening to William singing ""Hotel California"" was probably one of the low points of my life.Sadly, it became all too apparant that most of the entertaiment value of Mr. Hung is directly attributable to his dance moves and facial expressions. None of this charm is carried over into this album.Karaoke backing tracks do little to compliment the attempts at singing. Even the signature tune ""she bangs"" has a flat feel to it.Well done to William for making some money but avoid this album like the plague unless you want to punish your eardrums."
1,Save yourself,"It's just wrong for the record label to sign this guy just so people buy his album to ridicule him. No one bought this CD expecting good music. William Hung is a bad representation for the Asian community. There are Asian singers out there that can belch out some great notes and Will Hung diminishes their accomplishments. I feel sorry for the guy because people are laughing at him, not with him but he doesn't know. As for this CD, his rendition of Hotel California has forever tainted that song. I couldn't bring myself to listen to the entire CD because I need to clean my listening palette. If you want to get this to support Will Hung and let him make a few bucks, good for you but you listen to better singing at your local karaoke bar (or just sing in the shower)."
1,Probably the worst trend ever,"American Idol is one of the most shallow and trite piles of garbage on television, so it was no surprise that something that is already supposed to be a mocking of modern music is godawful beyond all description.This album was predetermined, because if you have ever watched any of the show you'd know that William Hung was an obvious plant by the producers. His lines were scripted and played for laughs, so this disgraceful CD is a fraud in more ways than one.If you enjoy making fun of foriengers because they can barely speak english, well then you're the target audience for this crap.The joke barely lasts one song and the rest....well, it's exactly as you'd assume. Take advantage of the sample downloads they give you here at amazon.com to see that even thirty seconds of this trash is enough."
1,Better than Kelly Clarkson but jagged like his teeth,"This album is so funny. Yet he's no way to stay around for awhile. But I think this Cd is better than Kelly Clarkson, Justin, & Clay's CD. Its the second best of all those who were in the American Idol(Ruben being first). This album is as jagged as the singer's teeth. Well what more can I say except don't waste your money its funny to hear but the joke don't last a long time."
1,SO SAD!!!!!,"It just really irks me that this album even got made.... No I didn't buy it, but heard his one song on the radio... Even though this is a joke... It really sucks for the people with real talent who never get to surface... What is music coming to?!?!? Just makes no sense to me at all.... This is all so stupid!!!!"
1,Andy Warhol must be spinning,"At 14:59 on the Andy Warhol fame clock combo kitchen timer, we have William Hung. While I am sure that this disc will have a relatively decent lifespan on Dr Demento and similar bad-and-or-novelty radio shows, is there any reason to drop your cash on this CD based on musical merit? You could just as easily send him a twenty and spare yourself the humilation of trying to dump this at a used record store by the end of the year, so the answer is resoundingly: NO. There are performances on this CD that could make Saddam Hussein start giving up government secrets. Maybe that's why it was recorded....a new weapon of mass destruction snuck into the arsenal under the guise of ""entertainment!""I am glad William probably will earn enough from his quickiecult status to wrap up his college degree, but this could easily take over the worst CD ever made slot from the likes of William Shatner or Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood."" It's really that ears bleeding bad."
1,This gag has gone too far,"Admittedly, I've only heard clips of one or two songs from this album, but that was plenty. With all the attention this man is getting on American Idol (plus all the other talk shows), no one seems willing to state the obvious: HE CAN""T SING! He has NO conceivable talent whatsoever! There have been geniunely gifted A.I. contestants who haven't received a fraction of this idiot's exposure. The only accomplishment here (if you can call it that) is we've found a way to make fun of Asians without being accused of being politcally incorrect. Good job Wiiliam! You must be so proud. (The single star rating was as low as I could go.)"
1,Waste of a CD,"What I wouldn't give for an ice pick right now, I'd stab my ear drums so I wouldn't ever have to hear this garbage again. I can't believe this Ass Clown got a record deal, the only reason he did is a bunch of morons felt sorry for him.William Hung you are awarded no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
1,What? No zero star rating?,"I think the joke has gone far enough. It's bad enough that this tone deaf no-talent has received as much press as he has, but to actually release an entire CD? It reminds me of this Christmas album we have with cats meowing out Christmas classics. It's really funny for the first several songs, but to listen to the whole album would drive you over the edge. I sincerely feel sorry for this guy. He really thinks he's good and hasn't clued into the fact that we're all laughing at him and sadistically encourage him to make a fool out of himself for our entertainment. Let's end the cruel joke that is William Hung."
2,For a narrow target audience (honor students only),"The book can hardly be called a college guide because it looks at only 125 schools. Of these, the vast majority are either Ivies, other highly selective private schools or a few prestigious state universities (e.g.,Berkeley). The target audience for this book consists of honor students with minimum board scores of 1,300 or better. It provides little meaningful information for the 'B' average student. When I first learned of this book, I expected that it would be a useful resource compared to the vanilla comments in college guides by Peterson, Fiske and especially Kaplan. I was mistaken. If your child is an honor student, the book does provide some useful insights about core curriculum, faculty leanings and campus political climate."
2,the closing of the American mind,"This book, like so many voices in America today, tells readers to avoid exposure to facts and arguments from different political perspectives. Is the case for the Right today so intellectually fragile that students need to be counseled to avoid certain classes, programs, and colleges, lest they be ""corrupted""?This promotes a ""hear no evil"" dumbing-down of American culture and politics, leading to the current decay of true conservatism in this country. Surely conservatives would do better by counseling their children to seek out diverse sources of information that will challenge their assumptions and force them to sharpen their intellectual skills."
1,Wrong Person Writing Intro,"I reviewed this book and its actually pretty good. I wonder though, what old high roller Bennett had to contibute...the top schools nearest to casinos? How about slots between classes? I can't for the life of me figure why author Beer had 7-11 Bennett write his intro. Maybe he needed help with those gambling debts. Do not buy this book. You are only feeding an addiction."
2,"Sorry, Priest isn't Priest without Halford","If you are looking for the original captivating Judas Priest sound you won't find it on Live in London. Without Halford, JP sounds like every other metal band. Ripper is a great vocalist and he does his job well however, Ripper cannot match Halford's vocal range and ability to harmonize with the lead guitar. To a new listener Live in London will have plenty of energy but, to those looking for vintage Priest it's not here."
1,Not the Real Deal,"Despite the fact that this album has a majority of the band's greatest hits, the Ripper era was not their heyday. Ripper is no Halford.I was fooled into purchasing this album by Ticketmaster. Thought I was getting a new(er) live recording from the past couple years w/ Halford back at the helm, only to find that they're passing off this old stuff as real live JP.If you want to hear classic JP live, do yourself a favor and buy Unleashed in the East instead."
3,Good cd but was it necessary?,"This cd as a majority of the exact same songs from '98 Live Meltdown, which makes me think one or the other was unnecessary. Tim Owens is a great singer and he rips through all the Priest classics. This cd is probably for die hard fans only. Otherwise save your money. Now that Rob's back in the band, I'm sure there will be another live cd/dvd from the next tour. I'd just wait for that. Only buy Live in London if you don't already have '98 Live Meltdown."
3,last live album with Ripper Owens,"Priest sound pretty good here. In fact, they sound better than ever. If this was recorded with Rob Halford, I'd give it one more star. If they dropped the weak, new songs in favour of tried and true classics, I'd give it a full 5-star rating.Halford's return opens the door for another live album sometime after they release their next studio album.http://trinimansblog.blogspot.com/"
5,"Excellent album, but amazon's seller is overcharging","I had discovered this band through the Cruxshadows. So when I went to buy their catalog, I started shopping. Buying Flicker there is basically $17. And the Limited Edition 2 cd set is $29. Do some research before you set your prices."
2,SMALL is the keyword,"When they say ""small"", they mean SMALL. I have 2 toy dogs and they were even too small for them. These are extremely undersized ESPECIALLY for the price. Just ridiculous. I only give it 2 stars because of what there was, my dogs liked them. There just needs to be more of it."
1,"Great idea, crashes Vista",The software loads and runs and through a little patience I was able to produce a test with my own pictures to see how it works. It has two problems on my brand new Lenovo Windows Vista Home Premium computer. 1.) It can't read information off my printer and gives a couple of error dialog boxes. When I print the calibration page the result is a couple of black lines which aren't useful. I had to print to a file then print that file from another application for my test. 2.) About 50% of the time I edit a project I'll get a blue screen of death and the computer reboots. This is the only problem I've had with any application on Vista. I am disappointed because my test was greeted with rave reviews by my target audience. I was hoping to print 50 highschool graduation announcements. I've been a PC user and programmer since 1985. If I can't get it to work it isn't ready for the mass market.
2,won't align,"Despite the printer alignment function, I cannot get the photos to print out in the proper alignment. I've wasted half the package trying to get the photos printed in the correct spots. Very frustrating!! It is also difficult, but not impossible, to assemble properly. Finally, there are NO options for formatting the text. The text font and size are preset and very disappointing."
5,great!,i love this single. if u've heard Ramp! (The Logical Song) and liked it u'll love this too. it has that pitched voice again. it'll get u dancin in no time.
4,waiting room germany,This play looks at the lives of Germans after the fall of the Berlin Wall.It is a collection of diverse and personal testimonies of german life a since 1989.The play is entirely composed of monologues which are taken from interviews collected by the author.I am in a current production of Waiting Room Germany which is on at The library Theatre in Birmingham on 11th and 12th of April.
1,Gel pieces came off of mouthguard,Shock Doctors are not durable. Gel pieces came off when bit down on during a game. Even tried 2 different Shock Doctor models - both fell apart. Went with a Nike which is holding up much better
2,"I love Neal Adams work...but unfortunately, it's marred.","I ponied up a nice chunk of change for this hardcover sight-unseen, thinking ""It's Adams! How could I go wrong?""Well, there are a couple of big problems.First, a lot of space is devoted to covers that Neal rendered. It was a common tactic at DC to have Adams do a cover for a book whose story was illustrated by an inferior artists. They generally promise a story with far more gravity than what's actually presented inisde. An extra story or two could have easily been squeezed into that space.Second--and most disappointing--is that Dick Giordano inks most of Adams' illustrations, and his thick-stroked style does not merge gracefully with Adams' organic and graceful contours. The end result is that instead of enhancing Adams' pencilwork, he often just drew right over it. Thus, a great deal of the illustrations here don't resemble what fans have come to recognize as Neal Adams' handywork."
3,"Good book, but no Denny O'Neil here.","This is a beautifully-illustrated, wonderfully-reprinted collection of some fun old comics with art by Neal Adams. Be warned, though, this edition does NOT contain any of the classic O'Neil/Adams Batman stories. Those start with Batman Illustrated by Neal Adams Vol. 2.A fun book nonetheless, but not exactly what I thought I was buying."
4,"Excellent, with one issue","This is an excellent, and exhaustive collection of Neal Adam's early work with Batman. The only complaint, and one which I want to warn potention buyers about, is this: despite appearing on the cover, The Joker's Five-Way Revenge does NOT appear in this collection. It's in Volume 3. Perhaps I should have done more research, but I bought this collection hoping to get that story, as it's one of my favourites. There's nothing wrong with the stories contained within - indeed many of them are excellent - but the cover is, in my opinion, a little misleading."
2,Not as I expected it,"Installed easly on Sierra 2500HD 08, but it was waste of time and money.my stock was functioning way better than Gabriel ultra.I really dont know what to install.this is my first time to install shock abzorber other than stock.Ultra here has no relation to ULTRA."
3,Limited Overview of Panzergrenadiers,"This book only gave a brief description of tactics, weapons and operations. Perhaps it was too ambitious to cover this broad a topic in one book. However, it was well-written and does address most of these topics.As an introductory text for those new to German infantry it would probably be a good read. I am currently looking for a more detailed book on the subject especially concerning operations on the Eastern Front."
3,Not the best of this series,"I own and prize the TECHNIQUES books about the Japanese Infantryman and the US Marines. This work lacks their detail. Panzergrenadier is pretty good, but not up to their standard."
4,Wealth of Information,"I'm still in the middle of this book. Some of it is a little silly, and I gleam over those parts in a rush. They are relatively few and far in between, and the wealth of useful knowledge and insight throughout the rest of the book is worth it. I am beginning to apply many of the principles for the first time... its not a magic formula, but it has initiated noticeable progress where before I was stagnating for some time. Its small and easy to carry around to read when you only have one or two minutes available.The only strange thing about this edition is that authorship is credited to Napoleon Hill, but much of the book speaks of Hill in third person, as if the revising author (who I think is W. Clement Stone) takes liberty to speak on behalf of the original author."
1,Melts in microwave,The external bottom warped 1st time used in the microwave. I couldn't place it on a flat surface without diminished thermos stability. I even followed the directions!
2,OK,The outside of this thermos is enormous while at the same time it doesn't hold that much inside. From 8am to noon food cools down to the point where it is luke warm at best. Wouldn't buy it again.
2,not ideal,I'm not happy with the thermos. It's awkward to handle. Too deep for food and not very useful for drinks. sorry I made the purchase
5,lots of great research and information!,"A new way of looking at our world and our differences. Time is such an important element in every aspect of our lives, and this book gives a world view of it."
2,Intellectual Abstraction,"I enjoyed the book up until page 111. There the author compared a person being late for an appoinment in Brazil as being somehow comparable to the murder of women in Arab cultures by members of their own family. How those two situations are even faintly comparable is beyond me. If that woman who is being murdered in the name of ""protecting an important social institution"" were known by the author he might be able to disengage from intellectual abstraction and acknowledge the inhumanity and horror the murder of these women in the name of ""honor"" actually represents."
5,Who knew you could unravel some of the mysteries in time?,"I absolutely loved this book. I actually began reading it in the library and enjoyed it so much, I decided I would like to own it so I could refer back to it over ""time."" If you have a curious mind and would like to stretch your imagination about how long you will be on this journey and this planet, you will enjoy reading this great book.M.M."
3,"Interesting Enough, but it was required","I had to read this book for a sociology class this year. The author uses anecdotes to discuss cultural variances of time. However, the text lacks substantial historical explanations that address why these variances exist. This is a fun collection of observations. an easy read"
5,a rare classic,"An excellent album by a Welsh band from 1969.I've not heard the CD but have a couple of records of In fields of Ardath. Seems the CD is out of print and no longer available. This recording has a good progressive mix in songs like Merry Go Round,Door,and Ardath. Sometimes has that desolate, far away sound similar to Renaissance,Aphrodites Child or early Genesis.Hammond organ is the primary insturment with piano doing the more mellower stuff. Rockers such as After the war, Light we see, and Apache 69 contain some excellent guitar and bass guitar work.The jazzy tango from Graham Bond, Spanish Blues and beautiful ballads like Extra Hour and my favorite Chances are all outstanding,not a weak track anywhere. IF you like ELP Yes and King Crimson or the other groups I mentioned you will really get into this, if you can find it.Hopefully it will be rereleased. Would love to buy used if anybody has this on CD. Thanks"
1,Sorry I disagree.,"I have this cd and found it a grave disappointment. Inconsistent at best, embarrassing at worst."
1,Poorly made,JUNK! Hose attachment keeps coming off and leaks when it stays on. The telecoping joint breaks and leaks. There must be a better product for this application!
2,Product Description Incorrect,Was very disappointed when the sprinkler arrived and it's only 40 inches tall instead of the 60 inches stated in the product description.
2,Good reference,"The big complaint I have is that I am new to Objective C and the author decided to change the terminology for Instance Variables or iVars to fields. So while reading this book I have to stop at every word ""field"" and substitute iVar or Instance Variable in my mind but it is such a common word that it gets lost when reading. This is very frustrating and no other book I've read on Obj-C uses the term ""field"" like this, so this seems mostly the authors personal choice.Otherwise it is a good reference."
3,"It's okay, but we want the live action version.","I agree with the last reviewer, when will US customers be able to enjoy the best tv series ever, the live action version of monkey magic? I used to run home from school to watch this, and everyone I talk to about it is fascinated. Bring on the real magic!!!!"
4,Monkey Magic rules,When I first watched it on TV I didn't know it was a chinese folktale I thought it was just anime. Kongo is my favorite characterand his jet cloud is his best transportation. I have seen all of the episodes and I think that they should come out with new ones.I only watched this because it has a great storyline. Monkey Magic rules all the way.
5,GREAT!,I have this movie and let me tell you it was GREAT. The story is great and the animation was exellent. I don't want to spoil anything for you so I'll just say GET IT! You'll thank me later.
5,The Best Resource for Supplement Info,"I have owned every edition of Mr. Mindell's Vitamin Bible. It is the ultimate resource on vitamins for the layperson. It is well written, organized, and simple to use. I'm so glad that we have yet another revised edition for the new millennium."
2,"nice info, but not enough","this was an ok book but it made me mad that i paid 5 bucks for a book that has writing larger than the writing in my 3 year old sister's books. it had good info, but the one about all 5 of the bsbs (which i bought) had more info than the one about just brian himself!"
5,"AA, Not the only way",provides insightful thoughts and alternative viewpoints to attacking route causes and focus to vexing problems -- not just alcohol
4,Jumping fun,"This jumper is great for times that my son wants to be active but I don't want him crawling all over the house. He laughs and jumps and laughs and jumps. It has a nice simple design (no assembly) and fits a variety of door frames. My only complaint is with adjusting it to the right height. It is difficult to adjust when he is in it and impossible to tell what the correct height is when he's not in it, so getting the right height is trial and error. Over time it has a tendency to slip, so it has to be re-adjusted every so often."
3,Big Baby Bouncer,"The bouncer is fine but we have a big grandson, 23 lb at 7 mos. It would help if the tether had more height adjustment. He is near the max weight but more of a problem is the doorways are short and we can't adjust the height more.Baby loves it and is getting the idea."
5,Excellent,My son loves this thing. We've been putting him in it since he was 2 1/2 months old and have had no problems. When he first got in it we put blankets behind his back to support him as there is a lot of growing room in this thing.It has never left a mark on our door and I have had no problems with adjusting it. I put it together myself in 5 minutes. It pinches the wall just right and I'm able to take it down one handed while holding my child.It's been a life saver.
1,Buy your kid a concussion,"these door way jumpers are terrible unless you have a really wide doorway.i'm especially sad because my son loved it before he crashed his head.the first thing our 6 month old did with both this and the other door jumper was lean back tolook up and crash his head into the door frame. he could easily have pinched his fingers!i cannot believe that they design it so terribly. make a six inch tray all the way around. it's so obvious.the designer of this product is just waiting for a lawsuit. luckily i'm not the suing type.unless your doorway is a couple feet wider than most doors, DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
3,Watch their heads!,"I loved this product until my daughter bumped her head on the doorframe. We installed it in a typical-sized doorframe and it was not large enough. Maybe in a future house our doorframes that have molding (to hold the product) will be larger. Even though I was literally sitting on the floor a foot away from her, as she jumped up and down she swung to one side an hit her head pretty hard. I don't freak out about little bumps and bruises here and there, but this product does not make me feel comfortable about leaving her side for even a moment."
3,Jumpster Doorway Jumper Review,This jumper is great for my 5 month old as it has good support and a tray for leaning on (maybe eventually she will want toys on it). My only criticism is that is difficult to adjust the height and she is already at the shortest length (ie to make the cord short enough that there is not too much weight on her legs). At just 5 months I am concerned that she will not get much use out of it as she grows taller.
1,a little lost...,"Great product, but (even after reading the directions) can not seem to adjust the height for my 8 month old...any advice??"
5,The best thing to register for!,"Once our little boy was 3 1/2 mos, we tried putting him in this; he wasn't sure what to do then but now he is now 4 mos and LOVES it. He jumps all around by himself and is smiling the whole time. I haven't had any troubles with finger pinching or anything else that folks mentioned. I highly recommend this toy. This is much better and cheaper than the exersaucer and he likes it a lot more!"
2,Not Made Correctly,This item is SO frustrating. What would seem to be a very easy toy to put together cost me over an hour of wasted time. The seat was not made correctly and I could not get it to fit on the frame. I spent a half hour trying to get it on and then a half hour driving it back to Babies R Us. I am going to see if the store has another one and put it together before I leave the store!
1,Worst Seat design ever,"I have yet to use this jumper.. it may be wonderful once it is assembled, but trying to get the seat on is IMPOSSIBLE. I don't normally have a problem getting things together for my son. This has caused the most frustration yet!"
5,Perfect!,"Buy this thing! My two boys loved it, and my niece pretty much lived in for about a year, and it still looks and works like brand new. Never a single issue!"
3,"Works well, but height is too tall","This works well, and baby is happy in it. But it's made for doors 8-11' high. The doors in our house are about 7' and once a kid is about 6 months old, they're too heavy and tall for this to be functional."
3,"Great, but hard to get in/out of","The door jumper provides calm, fun exersize for our little one who seems to really love it. The biggest problem I see with it is that it's extremely difficult, to the point of almost dangerous, getting our baby into and out of it. For that reason, I'm only giving it 3-stars."
4,Great fun but hard to adjust...,"We bought this for our 6 month old son and he absolutely loved it. He could sit in it and bounce for hours at a time. The tray was great and the comfy seat... the only thing we did not like was adjusting it. As my son grew obviously we had to shorten it, it was a pain everytime we tried. I don't know if we had a damaged one or what, but it drove us crazy! Other then that my son loved it and we were able to get a lot done arouhnd the house we might not have."
1,DANGER**,"My son was in the Jumpster Doorway Jumper 8740P5 yesterday afternoon and the spring broke and collapsed underneath him. He is 22 lbs (under the 25lb limit) and the height was adjusted properly so that only the front part of his feet were on the ground.I've contacted Graco Baby - don't know if just ours was defective, or there is a design problem. If you do use a jumper, follow the instructions to the letter. Thankfully, we did, and we were right there to pick up baby and console him."
4,Not for every baby.,"Don't get me wrong, these are REALLY great toys. Kids love them. This one in particular is very well made, easy to care for, and lasts a long time. I was so excited when both of my babies were the right age to use them, but neither of them liked it. I tried over and over again over the course of several months and their opinions never changed. I recommend trying someone else's first if you can to see if your baby is a ""jumper"" or not. Then get this toy."
4,Definitely A Must Have - but strap adjustability is limited.,"I borrowed this jumper for my 20 pound, 7 1/2 month old son - he absolutely loves it! And I'm feeling alot less fatigue in my arms and back. Unfortunately, I've found that the strap adjustability is a bit limited. In our 8 foot doorways (with 3.5"" molding), our son suspends about 5 inches from the floor (so I have to place a floor cushion under him). In our 7 foot doorways, he stands almost flat-footed (which I worry will strain his ankles & knees while jumping). Overall, in my opinion, this is a very worthwhile product - it has always stayed in place securely and has not marred our doorways."
4,Fun Fun Fun,"This is a great toy.My son has lots of energy to burn off and he certainly has a chance to do that with this jumper. Weight limit is 25lbs, I guess that makes sense, but he has so much fun in."
1,Disappointed--short-lived and loud clanking sound,"We purchased this when our son was almost 3 months old. He is a very strong baby and tall for his age. At first he would only shuffle from side to side, but it wasn't long before he could jump like a kangaroo! We loved it and so did he, but now he is 5 months and weighs 18 lbs. He is too tall for it (or too heavy, but not sure why since the weight limit is 25 lbs). His ankles are touching the floor and can no longer sit in it with his feet in the proper position. It is not adjustable to make in any higher off of the ground. Now, we face the problem that our baby loves this but cannot be in it anymore, and he just turned 5 months. He is going through jumping-withdrawal! We could only use this product for 2 months.Also, with every jump it started to make a loud, clanking sound, coming from ABOVE the spring. That sound makes me nervous and I wonder if it is defective or about to break. I'm not convinced it is safe."
3,Glam punk... French style!,"What we have here is basically a French version of The Stooges, but also with a touch of NY Dolls, Silverhead, Pandora and KISS.The English lyrics are quite weird, and sometimes don't even make any sense! And some of the arrangements are a little plodding. But when the band gets down to it, they rock - they rock HARD!And, by the way, it's released on Jurassic Punk (1974/1999). Packaging includes lyrics and bio (in French), and a nice slipcase. Sound quality is better than expected. AND it's limited to 2000 numbered copies!"
4,Hwyl iawn i Rhys Bowen,"Basically a British cosy with a Welsh setting and Welsh village stereotypes instead of English village stereotypes. Most of the humor derives from stereotyping and there's no great dialogue. Sort of Welsh Agatha Christie. Some of the detail is not authentic. The crown and the chair are different contests at the National Eisteddfod (the only one with a robed gorsedd of bards.) The crown is for free verse the chair is for cynghanedd. Ingenious plotting with no cheating. The clue is planted early on. No sex and minimal violence. As the Booklist blurb on the cover says ""a perfect book to curl up with on a rainy day."""
3,"nice but,","Nice setup, good sense of Wales and its customs and the silliness of outsiders. Evan needs to take a short trip to Scotland and get few lessons from M.C. Beaton's Hamish MacBeth"
2,Great for home ... not what I needed,"The unit is cheaply made, and literally bows out ward when used. It is very attractive, and does a good job squeezing a lemon, and would be fine in a home bar setting. I use them commercially however, and this thing is slow, has the stainless cup which MUST be used, and the rolling action of the handle is really slow. I don't think it would hold up very long under constant use. My bad however, for purchasing it without trying first. For home use ... great ... for commercial use ... don't waste your money."
1,"Metrokane L Press Juicer, Orange Handles Metrokane L Press Juicer dies in a year",Bought this one because the price was lower compared of other juicers. Nice looking. performance fair to good. Used it once to twice a month. Lock washer dropped off after about 1 year and gear metal ended up in juice.I would not recommend the purchase of this product.
5,Fun and Informative,The book tells what a number of Episcopalians consider the best reasons for being Episcopalians. It provides a different view of the Episcopal Church and reveals some of the humor with which we see our faith. You should recognize some of the names!
3,A Search,"In my search to understand a bit more about the Am. Episcopal church, I read this book. It is more of a brief look at some of the 'personality' of the people who inhabit the church rather than church doctrine or liturgy itself. This is an entertaining, often humourous little volume. If you are looking for information about the Episcopal church itself (beliefs, order of service, liturgy) this is not the book to buy. For that, I recommendWelcome to the Episcopal Church: An Introduction to Its History, Faith, and Worship. If, however you are looking for a brief glimpse into the humaness & humor of those who make up this church body, this is an entertaining read."
4,Good price.,"I bought these thinking they would work for my model plane that requires the wing to be attached to the fuse with rubber bands, however they were the wrong type, but they do work great for other things around the house."
5,Continuing the Trend,"Rifts World Book Two: Atlantis is another of the excellent settings in the Rifts role-playing games genre. It can be the starting setting for novice campaigners or an extension for established parties exploring the world after the apocalypse.Like all of the books coming from Palladium, Atlantis is richly illustrated. The mecha, alien races and new character classes are fully described and developed. Play is well balanced depite the presence of the awesome and dreadful Splugorth and their minions. Player will find no end of challenges and exotic locations on the reemerged continent of Atlantis located midway between the American East Coast and Europe.New character classes include: the Tatooed Men, True Atlanteans, Undead Slayers and the treacherous Sunaj! I recommend this book and series to anyone interested in old-fashioned social gaming. RIFTS: Atlantis supplies the material for several marathon weekends of charts and dice. Bring on the pizza and Mountain Dew!"
4,I have just purchased this book for my Rift's campaign.,"This is a well written book, with tons of information on the Splugorth, and other minions of Atlantis. There are also plenty of O.C.C.'s and R.C.C.'s to choose from and loads of ideas for new adventures. A must have."
3,A bold line,"This pen offers a great bold line compared to flairs, but a student should stock up on these pens if relying on them to take class notes. Unfortunately even pens made for the visually impaired cost a lot."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this pen. I heard is was more like a ink pen but to me I could of bought a Flair marker, since that what its more like. That way I could of saved some money!!!"
2,boring workout,"The contents are very poorly organized. It is hard to find the place you want in this CD. The quality of the main classic workout is very poor, the routine is monotone and boring and the music is very old. Well, if by ""classic"" they mean ""oldies"" that what you get."
1,don't bother,"This is not as good as the other reviewers here on amazon make it out to be. Almost every aspect of it is poor. I wont mention the plot because there isn't one. Its just some guy goofing around on a very old computer with some very bad sex scences inter cut beween shots of him typing in a stupidly large font size. For a much better erotic movie get 'Victim of Desire' instead. If you do you will notice that 'Virtual Desire' has used some scenes of Julie Strain from 'Victim' as a filler in this one. Talk about scraping the barrel. Both are byJim Wynorski, so I can only assume he got bored while making this and dipped into the archive. Don't bother with this: Buy Victim, not Virtual!"
3,Not that great,"This movie only gets 3 stars because several of the girls in it are extremely hot. However, the scenes are not that great. All you ever really get is boobie shots...love the boobies but this movie could have delivered so much more.Overall, a disappointment."
1,Julie Strain's is a guest appearance....,I had seen this movie hoping there was a lot of Julie Strain. But to my disappointment her role ends after the starting minutes of the movie.... Rochelle swanson is fine but a disappointment for me overalll....
2,my Bride is a Mermaid,if you're a fan of a character that Screams all the time this anime is for you i got though the 3rd episode and called it Quits
5,Anna's ginger thins,"These ginger thins are great. They are an excellant snack and great with coffee. I recommend these highly and I am sure that when purchased by anyone they will feel as I do ""THEY ARE GREAT"""
5,"Classic "". . .book by it's cover.""","I was craving my absolute favorite GS cookie in October and went on a desperate search for a possible equivalent. What I have discovered in these delicious thin wafers is amazing. Defying all appearances, OMG these are soooooo good. I won't mourn for GS cookie season any more. These are wonderful ""consolation,"" and now I'll buy the GS simply to support GS. I have no trouble believing that these were originally created for a King, as the box says. Don't be alarmed; they look dry and thin in the classic European manner of visual understatement. They taste MARVELLOUS, but no one steals them because they LOOK -- eh -- blah. But in the mouth -- AAAAAAH -- they melt into a perfectly balanced, luxurious mint chocolate that I now crave on an ongoing basis. Not just good, they're OMG good!"
2,transfat cookies,I was very diappointed to find there were trans fats in these cookies.Ginger is one of my favorite flavors - however not trans fats.I would not buy them again until the trans fats are removed.
3,Cookies good-shipping bad,I love these cookies and intended to give them as gifts in gift baskets. Each box had more than 50% broken cookies so I did not use them for gifts. The case packaging is obviously not adequate for shipping.
5,Anna's Orange Thins review,"The only thing wrong with the Orange Thins was that some of them were broken, although they appeared to be well packed. Flavor, etc., could not be better."
5,"very good cookies, but....",Apparently the shipping process requires better packaging - more bubble wrap. These cookies are thin and quite fragile. At least 10% of the cookies came in fragments.
5,"Great Cookies, Great Price","I just received my first grocery order from Amazon. Included in my shipment was a 12 pack of Anna's Ginger Thins. Mine arrived in excellent condition. Just a few broken cookies. They are quite delicate by design after all. I wouldn't hesitate to order fine cookies like these from Amazon again. Great cookies. Great price. Tax free. Free shipping. My goodness, what's not to like? Don't live in fear, order some cookies. They're fantastic, and so is Amazon for providing them."
2,Not so Hot,"I enjoy this brand of cookies, but this flavor just isn't very good. It tastes a bit like stale coffee."
3,Not the best flavor....,"I LOVE the ginger thins, so thought I would try some of their others. These were the worst of the bunch. (I also tried almond cinnamon & chocolate. These tasted like they had been cooked too long and they tasted burnt. To look at them, they were only a little brown. I LOVE lemon coolers and these didn't have much of a lemon flavor at all. I would not buy them again."
2,lemon cookies,Love Anna's cookies but ordered this many did not work. The last six boxes even though they had previously been unopen began to loose the lemon flavor and the last four boxes the cookies became limp. Will still continue to buy Anna's cookes but not a dozen at a time.
4,It is not wireless,"The product description used by Amazon is misleading. The description seems to make a big deal out of touting the idea of a wireless system. The only ""wireless"" part is the two boxes with antennas only used if you buy another two speakers and create a Dolby 7.1 environment.As it is, the five speakers that DO come with the unit are wired. There are also NO mounting brackets for the walls like with other systems. I had to spend another $60 for those.My center speaker is making a sound like the actors in movies talking through tissue paper.I called J&R; Electronics, who Amazon sends your order to. They could not help me and suggested I return it to Amazon or call Kenwood. Kenwood left me on hold for 40 minutes before telling me the same.I am disappointed. But I see that many other people are enjoying this unit so I will mess with the settings a little more and see what I can do...."
5,A Kind of Sadness,"Beautiful, dark music for those rainy days when you just want to stay inside and watch the raindrops fall outside your window...also perfect for those rainy/snowy day drives through the countryside."
1,"Dark, dismal & depressing cello","Buy this CD only if, for some reason, you need appropriate mood music for sipping absinthe or hemlock . . . whichever."
4,awesome product,"I first tried this while on a cruise. The spa technician gave me two free samples. It was amazing how much it helped my pain levels. I have fibromyalgia and have had multiple back surgeries. It definelty took the edge off the pain after the first bath. If I use them on a regular basis, once a week or twice a month it helps the most. But, that gets expensive and they do help any time I use them. I highly reccomend it to anyone."
4,Soothing but Expensive,"The Elemis Musclease Herbal Bath is part of a 3-part Elemis process. Very relaxing - feel great after soaking in the bath, but it's very expensive to use, particularly on a regular basis."
3,Small black & white architectural monograph from Gustavo Gili,"ISBN: 842521582X ONLY is an exclusively black & white, concise (235 pages), and copiously illustrated paperback survey published by Gustavo Gili (GG) of Barcelona in English and Spanish (side by side). A short introductory part on several pages is followed by the main review part presenting each shortly described project in excellent B&W photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line presentation drawings, sketches, etc. At the end, there are several pages with additional information incl. biography. Most of hundreds of only B&W illustrations are technical, but all (incl. B&W photos) are of a good quality, well balanced, crisp and legible. Like all from the Works and Projects series, it is solid among architectural monographs, but slightly smaller than the Studio Paperback series published by Birkhäuser Verlag under ISBN: 37643* (Basel)/08176* (Boston) or Artemis Verlag under ISBN: 37608* (Zürich)/18740* (London)."
5,"Awesome, diverse prog rock!","These guys are truly impressive. Their debut CD features a WEALTH of talent from every member. The music is heavily influenced by greats such as Queensyrche and Rush, and the singer is nothing less than a musical chameleon who seems to be able to completely change the timber and tonality of his voice at will. On this CD, diversity is the word, covering the spectrum from heavy, earthshaking songs to mellow, introspective tunes. For anyone who loves Rock of any genre, there is truly something for everyone on this CD! One of my favorite releases of 1998."
3,"Moderately interesting, but much too long","If this book had been a magazine article, it would have been excellent. As it stands, though, I found it really hard to get through the last hundred pages or so. Cheever tells a few amusing anecdotes, and he has some insightful comments -- but there is not enough substance to justify writing an entire book."
1,This book ...,"Here's the plot -- rich guy decides to dabble in the world of work with the rest of us and realizes it isn't pleasant. Too long. Too pompous...""Working Stiff's Manifesto : A Memoir"" by Iain Levison was a much better book."
2,Selling Ben Cheever,"I've got mixed feelings about Selling Ben Cheever. It is funny at times and the last ten pages or so almost redeem its worst moments, but I still can't wholeheartedly recommend it. I've been reading this book at a time when I find myself unemployed and at moments have been able to appreciate the book on this level. But the fact remains (and Cheever admits as much in the opening pages) that the author did not write this book because he was down and out. I remained conscious of this throughout reading the book and because of this I really couldn't take it too seriously-- it seemed to lack the sense of urgency and pain that accompany unemployment. For insights into those who find themselves unexpectedly cast into the service economy, don't read this book. For the occasional amusing anecdote about ridiculous jobs then this book might be for you."
4,"A Valuable Book, Despite the Author's Attitude","I found this book witty, insightful, and fascinating - until the epilogue. Until that point, I had blissfully misunderstood Mr. Cheever's attitude toward his jobs and his co-workers. I had incorrectly perceived that he regarded both with some respect. But in the final section, he demonstrates that he (like author Barbara Ehrenreich) has contempt and even horror for the type of work that he is chronicling, and that he assumes that anyone who sells computers or cars is doing so out of economic desperation. Still, the book is a good read, and despite the author's condescension, the reader can learn and appreciate a great deal about the intelligent, hard-working employees in a variety of fields."
1,Biggest waste of 22 minutes in my life.,"My God, where do you start? If you want to blow some money on 22 minutes of the worst martial arts demonstations and questionable interpretations ~ buy this. If, on the other hand, you really want to learn martial arts, or want a deeper understanding ~ DON'T BUY THIS. I doubt any of the black belts in this video ever did bunkai or their kata performance would be above yellow belt techniques. Some of the comments by the speaker, such as they don't do shime during Sanchin because of ""liabilities,"" makes you ask what other excuses and fantasy they created. In short, it's simply the biggest crock of horse manure one could pack into one DVD. If it was possible to give negative 100 stars, this would be the first candidate to come to mind. A complete waste ~ avoid it like the plague!"
1,these gloves are garbage,The padding is too bulky toward the knuckels. There is no padding on the fingers. The gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster. Overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves.
2,OK MOVIE BUT AVOID THE BLU-RAY,"The movie is OK, mildly amusing, one or two lol moments. The Mill Creek blu-ray, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The film itself was upconverted, not remastered, to high def. No movie on blu-ray should look that soft and grainy. It only has a Dolby 2.0 audio track, and for the second half of the movie it was out of sync. Good thing I only paid a dollar for it at a dollar store. Yeah, it's THAT cheaply produced. You might be better off with the DVD."
5,"Great Product, easy Transaction.","Quick delivery, phenomenal price and the product is something that i have used for a long time, so product has always been wonderful. New company for me and i will stay with them, as i need product regularly. Price cannot be beat, as i have tried here and in Canada."
3,liked the beginning but end way to quick,"this is a good anime , but i started watching it and by then end i wanted to hit someone,this series basically is an infinite loop. watch 1->end then re-watch 1->end. the end basically rewinds the story back to ep 1. its funny but just too short there should have been more episodes to have a better ending"
4,Magical Harem Comedy,"Your standard harem comedy with a few twists. I enjoyed it but the harem anime genre is generally hit or miss with many viewers. I'm sure there are enough plot synopsis posted that i don't need to explain what's going on here. Watch this if you want an anime that's good mindless fun. It had a decent number of laugh out loud moments and even a memorable character here and there. It's certainly not a top tier anime, but i wouldn't cross it off my list completely. For 20 bucks, if I didn't have much else on my list to watch, i would give it a shot.For similar anime, see Tenchi GXP, Negima, Demon King Daimao, and My Bride is a Mermaid (which is great but the localization sucks)."
1,awful,"The series is so bad in plot, character development, and voice acting it is painful to even recall it. Don't waste your money or your time with this. Maybe if they paid $10.00 and hour to view it, it would be worth the time spent watching it. I am a fan of anime, and there are even some magical girl genre I enjoy, but not this awful hodgepodge."
1,Magikano,Girls are represented by short skirts often showing their panty. Speaking about healthy sex for men. I have the impression that it is some kind of sexy cartoon for inhibited males. It is just worth to be thrown into trash.
2,Magikano:The Complete Series S.A.V.E,"I personally thought that this series was to mumbled together. It had a weak storyline,stupid and very annoying characters,and it just didn't jive together. The animation was good,but I think that the writers should have tried to come up with a more compelling storyline. I am only giving this series a 2.1 out of 5 stars do to lack of storyline and annoying/creepy characters (one sister in particular has a strange ""obsession"" with her older brother)..."
4,"Not bad, not great","If you read the editorial review, that's pretty much the series in a nutshell. The series never really grabbed me or got me truly involved with any of the characters, and the last episode was disappointing, at least to me. Lots of innuendo, some good laughs, distinctly NOT for younger viewers, the innuendo is pretty heavy handed."
5,Unbelievable,"If your a fan of skiing, or snowboarding alike, you'll love this movie. Jeremy Jones takes snowboarding to a whole new level in this film. With segments in Utah, Chamonix, and Alaska, this 2 year TGR project is exciting and awe inspiring. The movie has spectacular mountain views and places that have never been seen in a ski film before. You'll be on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. This is not your typical ski movie with Terrain park jumps and Helicopters. Jeremy Jones, Travis Rice, et al. hike every single one of lines, many times with technical mixed climbing gear like ice axes, crampons, and rope. So if your looking for crazy ski lines with un-tracked powder and good music. Definitely buy this DVD/Blue-ray."
3,Good performance - bad sound,This one is STRICTLY for the obsessive TR collectors like myself. The master was obviously a HIGH generation tape of the original radio broadcast. The real shame of it all is that the performance itself is worth hearing - particularly considering the unusual set list.
2,"Good performance, Bad sound","I'm a enthusiast of TR from 70's in Japan. This CD is not worth hearing. Because this master tape was recorded by TR's monoral casette player. If you have a good ear, I will recomend another live CD (Live in Chicago is much better)."
1,Manheim Collection,This is a ripoff. I paid $48.00 for a CD that is the exact same CD as the $15.00 CD Manheim and the Mouse. When I sent the CD back for a credit I was charged a restocking fee of $27.00. I think this is the last time I will do business with Amazon. I have been a long time customer with Amazon.
5,Shocking,"Paul Findley's candid study of the fanatic pro-Israel lobby is disturbing, to say the least. It is shocking how so small a percentage of the population can weild so much power - I am not so much intrested in middle east politics, what concerns me most is the lobby and memebers put the interests of Israel first, often at the expense of America - Although not the focus of the book, a section covering the extent to which they spy on us, and how it is largely ignored by the FBI is, to say the least, shocking."
5,It's about time!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It really is about time someone told the truth about the Israeli lobby. To date, the US government has given $91 billion. That's way too much for a foreign country, especially since we get so little in return. No one in Congress has the courage to stand up in the way of blocking unnecessary aid to Israel when other people need it more."
1,Garbage!,"Paul Findley is so utterly ignorant, it is mind blowing.Israel is not perfect, but it is 100 times more democractic than any country within 1000 miles of its borders."
4,They Dare to speak out,"This books seems even more timely today than when it was written almost a decade ago. This is one of the rare credible voices of reason in a country that has succumbed to the powerful and corrupt Jewish lobby that seeks to advance Jewish and Israeli objectives at the cost of the American and Palestinian public. This truth, while public knowledge for much of the Middle Eastern world, is made known to the oblivious American public. My salute to Mr. Findley for his courage to write such a balanced book, despite the fact that he had risked much, his political future, and physical security!"
5,Exceeded expectations.,"The book was delivered ahead of promise, was in better condition then expected. A must read book for all high school to gerintology."
5,Well written,"Great book, very well written and informative about an important issue, which is special interest groups that are too powerful. Everyone should read this book, especially if your unhappy with the way washington works"
5,The prerequisite for a true understanding of US policy,"This book is the first of many to inform US citizens, in an unbiased fashion, of the true underpinnings of US policy in the Middle East. It is by no means anti-semitic propoganda, and anyone who wants to know why there are Isreali spies in our country, why Isreal is the only country in the middle east to not sign nuclear arm agreements, why Isreal sunk the USS Liberty in 1967, and why we are continually at odds with muslim nations (among other invaluable information) should read this book."
5,ISRAEL'S DISTORTION OF HISTORY AND THE TRUTH,"This is one of the most balanced books I have read about the ""real"" (vs distorted) history of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and a powerful indictment of the blackmailing power yielded by the pro Israeli lobby on the US Congress and political establisment.The result of this excessive power is a US policy that continues to support Israel (the aggressor) and ignores the plight of the Palestinians (the victim) living under a brutal military Israeli occupation with its illegal settlement or colonization strategy and subjected daily to harsh and humiliating harassment coupled with indiscriminate killings of civilians and political leaders."
3,Informative but flawed,"I liked this book to be honest. It highlighted Israeli espionage in the United States, a topic which is usually washed away, except for the high-publicity Jon Pollard case. However, reading the book, I thought Rep. Findley was a bit naive or in denial. In one chapter, he seems sympathetic toward an Arab-American who called Yassir Arafat a ""man of peace"". If Arafat is a man of peace, I'm a Martian. In another portion of the book, he glosses over Jesse Jackson's notorious ""hymietown"" comments. While American institutions should have been defended more aggressively from Israeli esionage, and still should be, he seemed to ignore or sugarcoat Arab and Islamist terrorism. Well informed book written from a hazy perspective."
1,Where's OPEC?,To read Paul Findley is to think that the pro-Israeli lobby is not simply the most powerful lobby in the US but that it's the only one.Where in all this are the various OPEC-funded Arab lobbies? Where are the two most powerful lobbies in the US (the pensioners' lobby and the NRA)?AIPAC is small fry compared to all of them. So why does Findley spend so much time on a relatively insignificant lobby?
1,Living in a Vacuum,"Paul Findley's book is a long ways off.He ignores the effect of OPEC, American leftist circles, the State Department influence and many other factors in writing it.Findley also almost totally ignores American aid to Arab countries, including egypt that gets about 2 billion a year, and ignors that all these arab states are dictatorships.He then ignores that incitement against America that is rife throughout the world instead blaming it all on American support for Israel which of course is the result of those craft Jews.Findely, like so many of his fellow conspiracy theorists, are chasing illusions and racist illusions at that."
1,Anti-Israeli myopia,"Findley's book reflects an obvious hatred of all things Israeli. There are many unsourced quotes. Most importantly, he does not deal at all with the territorial rights of Israel in the mideast, both historivally and politically."
3,Nice basic system,"I'm very pleased with this purchase. Though I agree with the comments around lacking power (you need to turn the volume to 55+ out of 70 to get strong sound), the performance is solid. Easy to setup and use, a number of options for the type of sound you want. I do wish the remote was configurable with my Sony DVDR/VCR combo. But overall, a nice system for someone looking for a good audio complement to their big-screen tv."
5,I totally agree,"I agree with the ""better than BOSE"" review!the reson i got this was i dreamed of a sony home theater for this price.the first time i saw this at walmart,i used the demo,turned it up and WOW!this system has got power,420 watts!im turning 12 in 3 days and im getting a magnavox portable dvd player(MPD720)!all in all this system is even great for a large living room.if you dont know whether to get a panasonic or sony,think this;sony makes movies(sonypictures.com),does panasonic?no,therfore,sony is more experienced with home theater!Hope this helps you chose.TIP:use sony's cinema modes,located in MOVIE,for better sound quality!CINEMA mode A:for all types of moviesCINEMA mode B:FOR sci-fi or action with lots of sound effectsCINEMA mode C:for movies with violin,chello,etc. in the background"
4,best bang for the buck,"I bought the system from Circuit City for $179.99 on a 5 hour internet special. I got the system the next day using their in store pickup. The system was an easy setup. I watched To End All Wars right after I set it up. It sounded pretty good. It comes with a weak subwoofer (70 watts, non-powered). I hooked it up to my Playstation 2 and played Deus Ex. It helped the game out a lot. I plan to keep the system and build another subwoofer (200 watts, powered) with plans off of the internet (my dad already built one that sounds awesome). For $180 this is a great system. The remote control the system comes with can only control Sony products. If your still not sure about it and want to hear it for yourself go play around with one of Best Buy's displays."
4,"Pretty good, for the price...","Overall a nice system. Isn't as powerful as the wattage would imply, and speaker midrange seems a bit weak."
4,Many sony home theaters don't have picture zoom,"Many home theater systems with DVD player included, do not have a zoom feature for movie playback. You are not able to decrease the black lines at the top and bottom of wide-screen formatted movies. Therefore its better to by this receiver with speakers, and then buy a separate DVD player of your choice.Or just hook it up to your game system that plays DVDs. Or hook it up to your computer if your sound card has an optical output. Use it to play Doom 3/Unreal Tournament!!!You won't believe your ears when you play audio CDs. This Sony system greatly enhances the quality of my audio CDs, especially when you use the options such as Hall, Jazz, etc."
3,Needs an active woofer.,"I like this system for the money, but the passive woofer is as described ""passive"". I added a Sony active subwoofer and now this system kicks. The active sub cost me as much as the whole home theater system, but it was worth it. I use the system to watch tv, movies, and listen to music. The receiver and speakers are ""good"" for the price. I debated on returning the system because the bass I wanted was not consistant. But adding the active sub enabled me to get the sound I wanted and my total cost was less than $400.00."
4,Great Deal for the Money,"You really get your money's worth with this setup. It's simple, easy to set up and even easier to use. My beef was that (perhaps because my unit was not working right) while it's advertised to decode DTS from DVDs, I could never get that function to work. Instead of DTS I got...silence.Well, maybe it's me. However, it's supposed to be a ""no-brainer"" setup, sooo..."
2,Dont BOTHER,Hey people dont bother to buy this peace of Junk here is the reasons(1)its too soft(2)tooo expensive(3)low basspeople dont buy this forget about the people who say its goodhere this if u want a good set of speakers buy thelogitech z-5500that rocks 1010w of powerit shakes the wall and the table
1,Just not worth the trouble- too expensive and it leaks,"You have to do too much to be ""sure"" these bottles don't leak and then they still leak. If you buy these bottles and want to rely on them when leaving your home, make sure you take plenty of extra t-shirts, money to buy extra pampers and a new baby bag! Then G-d forbid a family member is watching your child, be sure you have an extra hour to ""teach"" the that person how to use the bottles - only to find out the bottles leaked anyway. It's just not worth the trouble or the money!"
2,Garbage,"So much for reducing colic - - these bottles are useless in that respectWe bought a few of these things, one the formula just runs out of them and the baby ends up soaked - - and the other nothing comes out at all.Still looking for better options as the Playtex VentAire leak and don't work either.Does anyone out there make a bottle that is not a piece of ****?"
1,Horrible product - don't buy,"WE DID READ THE DIRECTIONS and the product still works sporadically. My wife is a physician! The leaking problem is incredibly frustrating, especially when the baby is crying.Buy anything else - you will be very disappointed, especially at this price point."
2,horrid,"Of all the reviews I've read, parents are more concerened about the convenience of the bottles and features for the price. I even saw one mentioning that she had to switch to a different brand because of reflux.The bottom line is... They are convenient for breast feeding and interchanging, but they cause an extreme amount of gas when feeding, due to the awkward nipples that are provided. The bulbous base of the nipple, causes their lips to suck in air around the sides. The entire time they feed, you can actually hear tons of air flowing into their stomach. 5 stars for a product that ""I just bought today"" doesn't mean anything if you can only use it 1 day, because your child is screaming from colic due to the aweful engineering.I'd like to see more return reviews from people that used these more than a week."
4,A Good Bottle,"Let me start by saying my son has had no problem switching between bottle and breast. From the very beginning he wanted his food and didn't care how he got it. But, I've noticed that even the stage one nipple is too fast for him. He chokes and gags on this bottle. But, then again I've yet to invest in a bottle system. I've bought at least one of every bottle, except Dr. Browns - hoping someone will buy me some for my baby shower!I've not noticed a lot of bubbles in this. I have the VentAire bottles too and I've not noticed any difference in gas or colic. However, my son thus far seems to prefer the VentAire. I think because this nipple is just too fast for him.I think all babies are different don't invest in any one system. Let your baby decide...because ultitmately thats what is going to happen anyway!"
1,Bottles leak!,I am not an idiot and I know how to read instructions but no matter what I did the bottles would often leak and spill all over my son. I think that any bottle that requires that much effort to ensure it works properly is not worth the money. Not only that but as my son was drinking I would hear the air bubbles which meant that he had to be burped quite frequently. I threw all of the Advent bottles out and bought the old fashioned Playtex system. These are by far the best bottles and are the only way to ensure that excess air is not being swallowed by the baby.
2,Major headace..Gerber and Playtex are just as fine if not better,I would not reccomend these bottles. They leak all the time and at 2:00am when you are exhausted and your little one is screaming these bottles can send you straight to the nut house. Save yourself the headache and misery and just buy basic Platex and Gerber (I finally did after 6 months...way to long) and I had not had any problems since.
3,"Great Bottles, but....","These bottles are great, but my son would swallow a ton of air when he used them. When I was still nursing him, I loved how convenient they were to pump and store milk in them. They were also great for him when he started holding his own bottle. But it wasn't until he started eating formula that I used them often, so I didn't realize just how much air he took in. He spits up a lot and with the extra air it seems like it happens even more. I wish that I would have known this before I spent so much money on them."
4,mostly great,"I have been happy with the nipples and venting of the avent bottles. The only problem I've had is that they will leak occasionally. Making sure that the nipple is damp before you screw on the top seems to help. Though he was primarily breastfed, my son had no problems switching back and forth between these bottles and breastfeeding."
2,Great at first but then they leak,I never had any problems with the 4oz bottles but my daughter has been using the 9oz bottles for some time now and they worked great at first but after a while they begin to leak at times and I have to screw and unscrew the nipple on sometimes 5 or 6 times to get them to stop leaking milk all down the side of the bottle. I am having another baby and looking into new different bottles this time.
4,These are pretty good,"When my daughter was born 6 years ago I had a close friend who always swore by these bottles. Anyway I never tried them then but decided to move my colicky 3 month old onto them from Dr Brown's as we are travelling overseas and the Dr Brown's leak as well as having too many pieces to clean making them a hassle to travel with. We really like them and think that they are great! I like it that they have an intermediate nipple between the newborn slow and fast flow. They have leaked once but as my husband pointed out, as with any o ring if there isn't some moisture to lubricate it when fitting the two pieces together it will leak. Also with heating it up without removing the ring it allows for pressure to build up around the o ring and therefore cause leakage that way. I am happy with them and will continue using them. We also love the Avent Steam Sterilizer, what bliss! Well worth the $70!"
2,Not for us,"The bottles are great if you want simple bottles and can tighten them the ""right"" way. However, I could tighten 3 out of 5 of my bottles ""correctly"" but no matter what I did, I could not get those two other bottles correct. They would just leak and leak and soak my poor daughter. Also, my daughter had EXTREME gas from these bottles. She would SCREAM endlessly after every feeding. Even Mylicon wouldn't help her when using the Avent bottles. We switched to Dr. Brown's bottles and it is a remarkable difference. She doesn't scream and I actually look forward to feeding her! And I haven't used the Mylicon drops once since we switched bottles. If your baby is suffering from extreme gassiness, SWITCH bottles... it helped us!!"
2,Hate the leaks,"We started with the Avent bottles because that is what everyone else is using. When feeding our newborn, suddenly there would be milk/formula leaking out of the bottle. What a mess. I read the instructions and checked out the website looking for tips. I just wasn't impressed. I purchased a ton and they are all stored away. We switched to the Dr. Brown bottles and have not had any problems."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE SECOND TIME,"I love these bottles for the width which makes for easy cleaning.....BUT I purchased them when I had my now 6 yr old and they leaked REALLY bad then, and now, that time has gone by and having my second I figured I would give them another chance, hoping they had corrected the problem.....BUT NO 6 years later and they still LEAK just as bad..... They are leaking from where the white cap goes onto the bottle and you can unscrew it and screw back on several times and it will still leak. It causes a huge mess and unwanted laundry....... EXREMELY FUSTRATING!!!!!"
2,Not so good! LEAKS!!!,I was really looking forward to using these bottles. My son didn't having any problems drinking from them but no matter how I screwed on the top of the bottle it would leak around the ring and the bottle. Sometimes I didn't catch it right away that his bib and clothes would be soaked with formula. Even when my husband would tighten the top he would have problems with it leaking. So we would have to test over the sink each time we made a bottle to make sure it wouldn't leak. I also asked my sister and all my friends that have used AVENT bottles if they had the same problem. They all had problems with them leaking!
2,Not worth the hype,"I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles. Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent's Choice Anti-colic bottles too!! The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them. She loves the other two brands, and I love the Parent's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot. Don't waste time or money with Avent!!"
2,"Leaky Bottles, A Waste of Breast Milk/Formula","I am very disappointed with the Advent bottles. I am constanly struggling with them to keep them from leaking and my son seems to take in a lot of air while feeding. I looked through these reviews to see if other mom's had the same complaints. Sure enough I wasn't the only one struggling. Some of the good reviews gave advice on how to put the bottles together ""correctly"". No one should have to go through all that wasted formula or breast milk to get a bottle to work properly. I prefer a bottle that is easier to work with. We are still trying out bottles to see which one best works for us and so far I like the Soothies and the Playtex AirVent better!"
1,Leaky mess!,These bottles are so frustrating! They leak all over the place and a friend said that you have to make sure they're completely dry before tightening. Who designs a bottle specifically made for liquid that must be dry to prevent leakage? It's so frustrating to see the breastmilk that you worked so hard to pump flying all over your kitchen as you shake it up. I've thrown my Avent bottles away and will not recommend them to anyone who values their expressed breastmilk (or expensive formula!).
1,"Leak, Leak, Leaks!",I used Playtex bottles with my first child with no problems. I bought into all the Avent hype with my second and bought them. We hated them. They were such a huge hassle. We assembled them correctly and still had leaks. Over the past two years I have talked with many other moms who had the same complaint and swear never to use Avent bottles again because of leaks. Wish I had know that two years ago! We are now expecting our third child and I will go back to Playtex bottles.
1,Leaking Bottles,"I am a mother of twins, These bottles leak all over. If you don't close them a certain way they leak. Well, who has time to keep screwing on a cap just right?! Specially a mother of twins!!"
1,Too big,"My husband and I had decided to use the Avent bottles for our firstborn because they went with the breast pump that I bought. However, when we started our daughter on formula on day 3, we weren't able to use these bottles with her. She was a big baby but, her mouth wasn't quite big enough for these large nipples. She much prefers the Gerber newborn bottles or the playtex bottles. The nipples are too formed for her ""taste"". These bottles cost way more than the other brands and we had less problems with them. They aren't anywhere near worth the money."
4,Good bottle system,"We like this bottle system. It is easy to mix the formula. Sometimes it leaks, but if you pay attention to what you're doing when you assemble the bottle, it's usually okay. Sometimes there is excess air in the bottle, but it's getting better. The nipple is fine--my baby basically went from breast to bottle and this bottle was fine. Easy to clean too. An all-around practical bottle. I may try different bottles out just for comparison, but this is a great standby."
1,AVENTY BOTTLES,This is my first time trying the avent bottles and I am very disappointed with them. I just love the bottle shape but they are constantly leaking on the sides and since my baby has a small mouth the milk flows out too much and and out of his mouth. His clothes get more milk then his mouth. I have tried tightening and loosening the nipples but no success. My sister in law has the samew problem and I thought maybe it was just the pair she bought 4 years ago. But no success there either. I am now going to try the Dr. Brown bottles if I can return these back at the store.
2,Still leaks,"I am currently using these bottles for my eight month old and have had problems with leaking all along. I read the instructions and they still leak. They say they may leak if the nipple is not on tight enough and they may leak if the nipple is screwed on too tight. I have tried making it tighter, looser, and everything in between and it isn't any better. There are times I have no idea how much my son actually got because most of it is leaking all over and getting him wet. I was going to just stick it out but since I have found out I am pregnant again, I will definitely be using a different brand. It's too frustrating to deal with the leaks and mess of these bottles. The positive thing about them, as other reviews have said, is that they are easy to clean with the wide opening."
2,Not for the inexperienced but voracious eater,"If your newborn is a sucker like mine, do not get these bottles. The newborn nipple is too fast. I bought the entire line, having heard how wonderful the bottles were. Well, my kid gags and sputters through every feeding. I have read all of the tricks to get the bottles to not leak, it's a waste of time. I have switched to Dr. Brown, and they work great! Not to mention the ear ache issue of bottles without vents."
3,*sigh* Why the leaking???,"My husband and I had done quite a bit of research on different bottle systems because we knew we were going to use bottles instead of breastfeeding. We had heard nothing but good things about the Avent system and after using it, my 5 week old likes it. She latches on great and doesn't have any problems with trapped air and gas, however, the bottles have started to leak all over her clothes now. It's more frustrating to my husband because it seems to happen to him more often than it does me, but it is annoying."
1,Waste of Money,"On the advice of a friend we selected the Avent system, what a waste! Regardless of how tight the cap was on we still experienced leaks. My major complaints with this system was the gas my daughter suffered while using them, and the hassle of sterilization after each use. As a new mom my time is better spent elsewhere! After two weeks of dealing with the bottles we switched brands."
1,Disappointed,I bought these because of the positive reviews and because all of my friends rave about them. My son was unable to latch on to the nipples and was having a miseable time getting the formula out of the bottle. It was awful! He is 6 months old now and still can't get them to work right. We switched to the vent air. At least with vernt air you can use the Nuk nipples and they are better for teeth anyways! The Avent only allow the large nipples that in our case were useless. If I could return the bottles I would.
2,Suck Suck Suck,My newborn had to suck so hard for so long to get anything out of these bottles she hated them. We do like the wider mouths for make the bottles but its to much of a chore to get anything out of it. We bought Gerber's newborn set..its has 3 holes in the nipples and she loves them.
1,Keep your receipts!!,Go ahead and read all the reviews and try to make an informed decision based on others experiences. (...) The manual Avent breast pump wasn't strong enough to do the job. The Avent bottles leaked no matter if they had breast milk or formula in them. My son HATED the nipple on the bottles and refused to even keep it in his mouth. Doing it again I would purchase ONE of several different types of bottles and let my son choose what makes him happy! (...)
1,Poor Design,"I heard so many great things about these bottles, but am so disappointed! The nipples are just terrible. They didn't fit right and my son would suck and suck and NOTHING would come out. I tried replacing them, but the nipples themselves are so pricy! The cheaper Evenflo and Gerber feeding systems worked much better."
2,Not Happy,"I decided to register for the Avent bottles before my baby was born. I made the mistake of opening all the packages and washing them, leaving me unable to return them if I wasn't happy. Well, I was not happy at all with the bottles. Avent advertises that they are good for reducing colic because of the vented nipple, but I found this to be untrue for my child. She had excessive gas with these bottles and caused much discomfort. I spoke to a few other mothers who said the same thing. The bottles created such a vacuum that my daughter was unable to suck without having to stop often to release the vacuum that was created. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone especially if your baby has colic. I contacted Avent and they told me I wasn't assembling the bottle properly. Needless to say I demanded a refund for the bottles."
1,Waste of money,This bottle leaked all over and that is after following the assembly directions exactly AND my daughter hated it.
1,The Worst Bottles EVER!!!,"Our baby is 1 week old, and she wasn't feeding very well (she preferred to sleep). The flow of other bottles we tried was too fast, so we decided to try Avent bottles...BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!We bought a pack of 3 bottles, and nothing would go through the nipple...even my husband tried sucking on them and couldn't get any liquid to flow. The worst thing was that we had already tried to feed our baby with one, and she had been sucking air for about 15 minutes!!!We called Avent customer service, and their solution was to exchange the bottles, which we did...and ended up with 3 other bottles with the exact same problem. Talk about quality control, WHAT A JOKE!!!"
2,The leaking is a hassle,"Even after checking with the company about the hit or miss leaking and spending extra time making sure each nipple is correctly inserted, these bottles still leak. Not every time and not every day but on a regular basis. Very annoying."
5,I had no problems,We have not had any trouble with these bottles leaking. Thank goodness as these are the only bottles that my daughter seems to like. Because of the larger nipples she was easily able to go from bottle to breast with no problem. I have tried others and not found anything comparable in price or quality.
5,great bottles!,I use these bottles all the time for my son as well as the Avent breast pump. They are fantastic and I have never had them leak on my son and he is now 4 months old. I would highly recommend these bottles!!! It is great that you can pump right into the bottle and the caps are all interchangable with other Avent products such as the sippy cups-which I will most definately use next! I found them to work so well I have not experimented with any other brands.
4,Expereince and time-tested bottles,"Going on baby #4, I whole-heartedly endorse these bottles. The larger bottle makes them easy to hold, easy to clean and less of a mess when pouring powdered formula inside. I tried the drop-in system with other manufacturers' bottles, but with 4 kids, I don't need to be running out to the store for inserts all the time. I primarily breastfeed, but these are great for the transition to formula, for my husband or others to feed with expressed milk or with regualr milk when baby is ready for that transition. The nipples seem to last longer and don't get that slimy-rubber feeling I've experienced with other nipples when they need to be replaced. I'm putting these on my baby registry for baby #4. I've found that baby gear changes a lot from one child to the next, but this is one product category that I know I can count on the old standard, instead of taking chances on the latest fad."
4,Fixing leaky bottles,We had the problem of leaky bottles when my daughter was a baby and someone told us that the caps were on too tight. Once we stopped tightening them so much they seemed to stop leaking!
1,Do not buy Advent - They LEAK,"I have tried everything short of supper glue to keep them from leaking. Buy any other brand, just DO NOT BUY ADVENT!"
3,Bought what my friends had...,"I bought these bottles before my son was born because all my friends had them with their first babies. Well, now that I am four months into it, I'm starting to second guess my decsion. Mainly because they leak, and they have caused a blister on my son's lip and because my girlfriends all are using different brands for their second child! The leaking is very annoying especially when you do exactly as directions state. Now after spending all the money on these bottles, do I re-invest at this stage? I'm thinking about it!"
3,"Yup, leaky bottles a problem","I received the starter set as a shower gift because my mom asked around and was told these were the best bottles for babies to help prevent colic. They were great at first, however, we did have a huge problem with leaking bottles. That is frustrating when you are packing bottles for a day out, and you end up with formula all over your diaper bag. We figured we were over tightening the bottles, which was the case some times, but not all. Also, the silicone nipples are quite stiff. We found the playtex nursers were more suitable for our baby, they are much softer, and we dont have the leaky bottle problem. However...we are keeping the bottles, because in the future, they do have the very convienent handles and sippy tops one they graduate from the bottle!!!"
2,My Daughter Hated Avent Bottles,"I bought this starter set based on the good reviews and I had heard that Avent bottle nipples were the closest thing to breastfeeding. My daughter refuses to take these bottles. I think that the nipple is too hard for her - it doesn't really seem to mimic the breast to me! I like the bottles themselves but I don't think they are that great for a breastfeeding baby. I have since switched to the Playtex premium nurser system which has a softer nipple that my daughter likes. A word to the wise: when you are trying to figure out what your baby will take, don't buy an entire bottle feeding system because they may not like the bottle and then you have to start all over again. In retrospect, I would have just bought one Avent bottle and tried it out instead of dropping $30 for nothing."
1,Poor Design,"We have twin girls and were excited about the avent bottles that we had registered for. We received 32 bottles and have regretted registering for them ever sense. After following the directions, we have complaints about the nipple being a challenge for babies to get a grip on. A lot of the formula leaks out the side of their mouths while feeding them. This hasn't changed in 9 weeks, I don't believe they will adapt to them. Gerber bottles have worked great"
4,good overall,"As other reviewers have stated, these sometimes have leak problems, but with a little practice, the leaks are easy enough to avoid. My 6 lb. newborn daughter had no problems latching on to these, so the nipple is only a matter of preference to the baby. The bottles also clean easily, better than any other non-disposable that I have found."
1,Not Pleased...What a Mess!,"The Avent system was horrible for us. It claims that they are the best for ""Less Gas"". Not worth the cost. We experienced more of the formula leaking all over our child and us and we triple checked the setup but they all still leaked like crazy. The claim they help in the prevention of ""Less Gas"" is not true in our case. We tried the Playtex drop-in's and they worked good, but the Playtex VentAir system worked the BEST and for a colicie baby the results from the VentAir system were AWESOME! Some say the Avent system worked for them and didn't leak, but we find it hard to believe that the 5 packages we have ALL leaked around the nipple seals. Just our opinion we thought to share."
2,The flow is too fast,"My newborn son is a very enthusiastic eater. With these bottles, however, he's a little too enthusiastic...the flow (even with a newborn nipple) is so fast, he can drink 4 ounces in less than 5 minutes! The result? A gassy, fussy baby who was projectile vomiting, and not at all satisfied with the need to suckle. I swithed to the wide Dr. Browns bottles and there has been a tremendous improvement. I think Avent bottles are WAY overrated."
2,They Leak and take a loooong time to warm up,"If you are using these bottles to feed a baby breastmilk...they take a very long time to warm up. Remember that you can't microwave the milk so you have to place the bottle in warm water...it will take about 10-15 minutes before they are ready. Also, I found that these bottles leak. I read all the reviews and knew that it might be a problem, but decided to try them anyway...a mistake.Thinner bottles have worked best for me. I use the medela bottles (they come in a four pack and are sold as an accessory to the various breastpumps for storing the milk)"
1,Don't buy for baby!,I bought this as a gift to my sister in-law who is having her first baby and has no clue about bottles. I have had two and used Avent but..... when she opened these as a gift they were yellow and 1 four ounce bottle and 2 of the big ones! I paid 30.00 dollars for a set that I was suppose to get 5 bottles! My Avent bottles from Babies R Us was never yellow. I was embarrassed and I would never let my soon to be niece use these!
4,good bottles,"Like others have said, the bottles leak if you don't follow directions when putting the top on, but once you get that down it is not a problem. My baby has little spitting up and is not fussy or very gassy."
2,Not too keen about Avent bottles,"I tried the Avent bottles and they were really awful. First thing is that they create a terrible negative suction pulling-pressure while the baby is drinking, which is frustrating for the baby as it does not allow the food to flow freely through the nipple. It also causes the baby to suck air, causing severe gas! The negative suction pressure also creates a terrible noise, which is oh-so-annoying to listen to!!!!! Also, the nipples are made of a hard plastic and it started to create blisters on my son's lips from all of the hard sucking!!!! I switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles and they are much, much better, eliminating all of these problems! I tossed these bottles straight into the garbage! Don't waste your money!"
1,Leaking Bottles,"I bought the breast pump that came with extra bottles so I figured I would just use only these bottles and didn't bother to buy any others. The only time the bottle doesn't seem to leak is when I put the collar on with a storage cap instead of a nipple. That's rediculous that 95% of the time the bottle leaks all over my son. My husband and I are so fed up with these bottles that we continually throw them into the sink after they have leaked all over our hands when trying to mix powdered formula. It's also outrageous that people are saying that you need to tighten to a certain amount. I don't have time for that when my son is screaming for a bottle after waking up from a nap. We've gone on to finally use other brands of bottles after 3 months of this madness. I have no problem using the pump or storing the milk in these bottles for my next child, but will never use them with the nipples again. Very disappointed, especially when you even see celebs using this product."
1,Don't buy a starter set!!,"We got the whole set at our shower. Since had heard good things I just assumed they would work for our baby. I opened and washed the whole set only to discover that my son (who is breastfeeding) hated this bottle. The lactation consultant I spoke with said a lot of nursing babies dislike Advent because the nipples are too hard. She recommended the Evenflo Elite. Sure enough, he loved that bottle the first time. We ended giving the Advent bottles away. So the lesson here is just buy one to see if your baby likes it before you buy a set!"
4,Convenient package,"I give this 4-star ratings as I don't quite like the cleaning brush. I think the brush could be improved and also include a smaller brush to clean the silicon teats.Overall, Avent is good brand and it's 'Made in England' so quality is better. It's easy to hold, easy to wash. My baby's on it since a few days old as my milkflow came on the 5th day, so we had to supplement her with some formula first (Malaysia is a hot country, so I need to keep the baby hydrated) I find that my baby is able to switch from bottle without problems, and there was almost no confusion at all. NO COLIC at all. Most importantly is that there are only a few parts to wash for Avent bottles!!Dr.Brown has got 6 different small parts to wash after each usage, so life can be a havoc if you're a busy working mom. Dr.Brown is 'Made in China'. And so is 'Tommee Tippee' bottles."
1,BPA,"I tried these, however, after calling AVENT I was informed that the bottles contain BPA! I switched to the tempo liner bottle and my son took the change fine."
2,I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS- and WOW still leaked.,"I had these bottles (which are quite pricey) when my daughter was born. These are what I registered for because everyone said they were the best. I am just telling you that after a few months, I dumped these for much cheaper bottles. I DID read instructions, I did call and email Avent for guidance. I am not a moron, I know how to assemble a bottle and I did go step by step with them and still, leaks. Before buying these, just ask yourself ""If I have to read detailed instructions to put a bottle together, and it still might leak, is it really worth it?""Trust this experienced mom. It's not."
2,too many bubbles,"A lot of bubbles form in these bottles for some reason. In other bottles (Evenflo, in particular) when I mix the formula not many bubbles form, and the ones that do will dissipate over a short time. In these ones, the bubbles do not go away and the baby ends up getting too much air with his feeding. Plus, you can hearthe air going in when he sucks. ""Read the instruction book"". I don't think so. How about just don't fall for some overpriced middle brow Euro fad."
1,nothing is coming out!!!,I just read all of the reviews here and i see that no one is having the same problem I had. I decided to try avent bottles this time around because i figured it would be less maintenance with cleaning as when I used Dr. Browns with my son the first time around. I was very dissappointed with avent because my daughter is sucking and sucking and nothing is coming out? does anyone know why this is happening? I am not breastfeeding either. so now I am back to dr browns and she has no problens sucking but is constantly getting the hiccups. I might try somethimg else before making my final decision but again I was unhappy with Avent!
3,Great bottles but beware of leaking,"I would love these bottles, except they are very prone to leaking. You have to put them together just right or they will slowly leak. You will think your baby did a wonderful job finishing off his bottle; then when you lift him to burp him, you'll find him drenched with milk.We're weaning him to a sippy cup now, and these bottles have lasted us 10 months, but if I could do it over again I would get different bottles with which I wouldn't have to worry about leaking problems."
2,Not good for smaller mouths,"I had to switch to bottles because of low milk production and having to supplement soon after my son was born. I love the look and feel of avent bottles but my son has a small mouth and was unable to get a good suction on this nipple. He would leak milk everywhere or squirt it at us, it was very messy. Therefore I had to switch very quickly to playtex standard bottles.I also don't recommend buying many 4oz bottles, my son drank less than four ounces for only about 6 weeks and he was up to 5 ounces, and it is a pain to have to fix two bottles."
4,Great Bottles,"I originally bought these bottles b/c they were recommended by almost every breastfeeding person that I asked and since I was planning on breastfeeding I decided to go w/ this starter kit. I appreciated the variety of things the kit had to offer. My baby was born prematurely and never really took to breastfeeding but I decided to pump breastmilk and feed it to her via bottle. I tried several other brands, but none worked as well as these did for her. I always found myself buying a few more of these. I have fed my child 6-8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w/o further error. I also use these for storage from time to time w/ the addition of a sealing disc. It would have been nice to have a couple of sealing discs included in this pack."
1,no time for leaks,"I registered for and received these bottles as a shower gift. At first I loved the ease of cleaning and sterilizing, but soon after switching from the breast to the avent bottles I began experiencing leaks no matter what I did. As a new mother of twins I have no time for leaks. My husband and I have grown tired of formula dribbling down our babies chins and piling burp rags all around the bottles. When you have two babies there is no time for extras like fussing with a leaky bottle. Who wants to worry about leaks when you have babies crying at two in the morning. I was warned about this by my sister, sister-in-law, and others I should have taken their advice. I will be out shopping for new bottles tomorrow."
3,Did not use for second child,"These bottles did allow me to nurse and work at the same time, which is why I went as high as 3, but as soon as he was done with the bottle I threw them all away. They leaked like crazy. I guess my husband and I did not have the ""touch"". We tested different tightnesses, but still it leaked as my son ate, when we would store the bottles in insulated bags, and when we tried to shake to mix the contents. We put up with them for a year. With my second son we used playtex. He still went back and forth nursing and using the bottle. I did not have leaks, and I was happy. Before you purchase, decide if you want to take the gamble to see if you will be able to tighten accurately. I personally want to tighten and go."
1,No One Told Me These bottles Leak!,"We bought these bottles because they were supposed to be the closest to breast feeding. I was planning on bottle and breastfeeding. These bottles leaked all over my baby and our rugs.We had to change the soaked outfits in the middle of the feedingand put more formula in the bottle. ( all in the middle of the night when we were half asleep...Also, my son had the worst gas because he was sucking and sucking and wasn't getting only small amounts of formula and probably air..It was taking him 45 minutes to drink 3 ozs.. We switched to Dr Browns since my son has Reflux and have been so happy ever since. Of course after I asked around, everyone else had the same problems with the Advent- now they tell me! I'm here to tell everyone, don't buy these bottles. Advent should go back to the drawing board and fire the product developers who worked on this!"
1,Don't bother with these bottles,"I registered for these bottles for my shower. They are horrible. They leak all over the place and my poor son gets soaking wet. I have to stop and change him, meanwhile he's crying because he's hungry. I had gotten the Playtex Ventair bottles too and they are so much better. They do not leak and prevent air from getting in my son's belly. I went out and bought more. Never again will I use Avent bottles...waste of money."
3,"Ok to start, but this is not all you need","We got the starter kit, but it wasn't nearly enough to really get started since we ended up having to bottle feed our baby. The kit includes a handful of bottles, but we ended up having to go out and buy 6 more bottles anyway. Also, the brush included does not fit into the nipple to clean it completely. Our son hates to two pacifiers included in the kit.Overall, I'd say, just buy some Avent bottles and a separate bottle brush that has a small end. It will cost you the same in the end."
2,Dr. Browns are the way to go,"I sunk a fortune into the Avent bottles based on all the positive reviews I had read. My son never did catch on to using these bottles. When he was a newborn, it took him forever to get anything because he struggled with the nipple. He also had a lot of problems with getting too much air, and I didn't find that these bottles helped with that in the least bit. We ended up switching to Dr. Browns bottles, which he never had any problems with and still uses now at 6 months of age.I do, however, use these as baby food containers and love them for that purpose. When I am not feeding my son an entire jar, I just spoon what I want into one of these. It fits in the Avent bottle warmer and this type of container is much easier to scoop baby food out of than a bowl where everything spreads out. Because of this, I gave these bottles 2 stars instead of only 1."
2,These didn't work for us,"I registered and received these bottles as a gift. I have a friend that swears by them. Just like a lot of other people, ours leaked no matter how we put the collar on and they didn't seem to help my daughter from getting a lot of gas. I bought the Ventaire bottles and love them. We don't have any of these issues anymore. I do like the fact that there aren't as many pieces to put together but the problems far outweigh the pluses with the Avent bottles for us."
1,Avent bottles leak,"These bottles leak terribly. Even on the newborn nipples, the milk pours out practically choking baby. Do not buy these bottles. I contacted the Avent directly and they were extremely unhelpful."
5,A great bottle!!!,"Avent was the only bottle that my son would take. I had bought and registerd for all Playtex bottles, so when my son refused the Playtex bottles I was stuck with a ton of them! Do yourself a favor and register for several different brands and see which brand your baby prefers. In my case, Avent was the bottle of choice. I have read several reviews stating that Avent bottles leak and I can't say that leaky bottles have ever been a problem. If you line the nipple and ring up and don't overtighten the ring, you will not have a leak. Many people also say that Avent bottles are more expensive. Compared with Playtex bottles, which is what MOST other people use, Avent would be cheaper in the long run because you have to buy liners for the Playtex bottles and that can add up. Plus, Avent lives up to what it says because my son has never had gas or colic. From my own experience, Avent has been wonderful and I would recommend them to any mother!!!!"
1,THESE BOTTLES ARE TERRIBLE!!!! Buyer Beware!,I have a four month old baby and these bottles are horrible. The leaking seems to be getting worse the more that I use them. I follow the directions and still terrible. I took reviews seriously when I registered should have listened...Good Luck!
1,Avent Bottles,"YOU HAVE TO TAKE A COURSE TO SCREW THE CAP ON THESE BOTTLES. THEY SURE LOOK CUTE, BUT THEY ARE JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. I FOLLOWED ALL DIRECTIONS AND IT HAS NEVER WORKED. STICK WITH THE CHEAP BOTTLES. THEY DO WORK AND NO BOTTLE WILL DO THE MIRACLE FOR GAS IN BABIES. IT IS A NORMAL THING. THEIR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS MATURING AND GAS IS NORMAL. NO $20 BOTTLE WILL DO THE MIRACLE. BUY SOME MILICON INSTEAD. IT WORKS WONDERS AND IT DOES NOT LEAK."
1,bottles are not good,"These bottles leak and cause much more gas then most other systems. If you are trying to avoid gas, try playtex originals or Dr. Browns. If you want to trendy, over priced bottle...get these."
1,MY FEED BACK ON THE STINKY AVENT,I HATE THOSE BOTTLES I REALLY DO..THEY GAVE MY BABY GAS.YOU CAN HEAR THE MILK GO DOWN HER LITTLE TUMMY.THE BOTTLES MADE HER DRINK 2 FAST SHES ONLY 5 WEEKS AND THEY WERE NEWBORN NIPPLES.THE LEAKING WHEN YOU SCREW THE TOP ON.SO I TRYED THE PLAYTEX VENTAIRE NATURAL SHAPE BOTTLES.LIKE ALOT OF PEOPLE SAID THERE GREAT I WOULD RECOMMED THE PLAYTEX BOTTLES....
3,I Didn't Like Them...,"I bought a 9oz Avent with disposable liners and a breastmilk storage set b/c I had heard so much about Avent. First, I didn't see how the nipple resembled the breast at all, but I decided that my daughter would have to be the judge of that. She seemed to not mind and infact, she loved it. Second, I didn't like the fast flow of the nipple...my daughter would choke and leak milk out of the sides of her mouth and the nipple didn't seem to ever quite fit her mouth. She seemed to not be concerned with it though and would adjust nicely, and she was never gassy with this bottle."
3,They leak if u use them wrong,"These bottles are excellent, they do leak only if you do not have the top on correctly. It takes a simple adjustment of the top and the bottle will be fixed, they do not continously leak."
2,These bottles leak whether you follow the instructions or not.,These bottles leak around the nipple even when assembled correctly. This can be extremely frustrating when you can't even get through a feeding without getting breast milk all over your hands and everything else. I would give these bottles zero stars except for the fact that my baby accepted the Avent bottles and has been reluctant to drink from the other popular brands. If she would accept any of the other brands I wouldn't still be using these.
3,"I did read the instructions, but the bottles still leaked...","I also had trouble with the Avent bottles leaking. Usually only a couple drops dribble down the outside of the bottle, but my bigger problem is that my son's face and neck are covered in milk when he's done. I don't know -- maybe it's just the shape of his particular mouth/face or the way he sucks, but we had no trouble with other brands!"
1,THE BOTTLES LEAK,"DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY. THE BOTTLES LEAK!!! I CALLED THE COMPANY AND THEY SAID IT WAS MY FAULT. THEY SAID I PUT THE TOP ON TOO TIGHT. THEY TOLD ME TO SELL MY BOTTLES TO A COMPANY CALLED ""ONCE UPON A CHILD"" WEB SIGHT. I WENT TO PLAYTEX AND I HAVE NOT HAD ONE LEAK."
2,Leaking problems - big time!,"I uses these bottles for my first two children - they were fine but with a few annoying leaks. Because they are so easy to wash, I was willing to overlook a few leaks when our twins were born, so I bought a few more. These are possibly the most ""leaky"" bottles I`ve ever used. I have read the directions, checked and rechecked that the nipples are installed in the ring properly, tightened and retightened the rings but to no avail! For the price paid for them, they should be of much better quality. I am dissapointed!"
2,Not User Friendly,"I also had trouble with the bottles leaking. It may just be a matter of not having the nipple perfectly centered or the threads on the cap perfectly aligned, but what new mom needs to be bothered with that in the middle of the night?This was my third child and the first time I've used Avent. My baby is 4 months old and I finally just gave up and bought a pack of cheap bottles. The Avent ones are just too much trouble and I didn't see any reduction in gas, etc. as advertised.On the plus side the wide mouth bottle is much easier to clean than the other brands."
1,Not for us!,"I registered for these bottles because they were ""The"" bottle to get at the time my son was born. However, after a few months of trial and error we switched to Dr. Brown's and have been extremely pleased. The milk either came out too fast or was too hard to get out. We tried every available nipple and could not find one to suit him. I threw them away and started over. My recommendation is that you buy only one bottle of several kinds and see which one works best with your child and then stick to that one. I wish I had not used so many of them and wasted them."
5,"This product meet all my expectations, my baby loves it","This product meet all my expectations, that is exactly what the advertising says. I understand that some babies seem a little hard on the nipple but for my baby and babies of two of my friends are the best products. With regard to the quality I must say that I have almost 2 years using the same bottles and nipples, and these have not been bad by the continued use and sterilization.This product does not produce gas at all in My baby , I simply put him over my shoulder and the gas is out. If your baby has a gas problem could you check what kind of hole is at the tip of the nipple... that would be the only cause."
1,NOT for newborns,"These bottles may be great for older babies, but are not good for newborns. The nipples are far too large, letting in too much air causing spitting up and lots of burps. We do not have these problems with Nuk or Medela newborn bottles and nipples.Contrary to another reviewer, even if you do assemble these bottles perfectly correctly, the still leak from time to time.For these reasons, I cannot recommend them for other newborns."
2,Just Ok,"I am not impressed by these bottles. Yeah they work and I guess get the job done. However, they DO leak and are not breastfed baby compatible no moatter how they are advertised. My son will drink from them when he HAS too but never is happy afterwards due to the gas it causes in him. I am not looking for a better option. I am glad they were a gift and I did not spend any money on them."
5,Love 'Em,"We have not had a problem with leaking unless we, the users, don't screw the lids on tight. Our daughter had no problem with the nipples, and we love that they are not latex. The only things we didn't do by the book, is that our daughter advanced to the next level of nipple about a month before each recommended age. But that will be individual to each child. We also love that we can turn these into baby food jars later on.We have now used this set on our second child and we still love them. This is the same set our first child used and we have not had to replace any bottles, nipples, or pacifiers. Nothing has broken despite child #1 sometimes launching a bottle across the kitchen. And this silicone nipples and pacifiers show no signs of wear or breakdown. As with child #1, child #2 advanced to the #3-nipple a whole lot sooner than Avent's suggested age, but again every child is different. Just watch your child for cues that she's getting the milk/formula at the speed that's right for them."
5,Love it,"I use Avent bottles and Avent pacifiers, and haven't had any problems with colic or gas. No nipple confusion either."
1,Nipples are too hard for nursing babies!,We purchased over 20 Avent bottles for my daughter before she was born because we had heard so many great things about the bottle and also saw the good reviews.My daughter took the Avent for about two weeks...then she all of a sudden decided that she didn't want to take it anymore!We tried every single bottle on the market and the only bottle that she will take is the Playtex Deluxe Nurser. The nipple is soft on her gums and it acts exactly like a real breast nipple acts.My advise to new or expectant parents is ... don't buy a lot of any one bottle until you are sure that your baby is going to latch on well! Trust me ... I have over $100 in unused Avent bottles that are collecting dust!
2,Leaky Bottles,"I see where others have stated that if you read the directions these bottles will not leak. That is NOT so. I am an educated person and I have checked and re-checked the bottles, they are assembled correctly. These bottles are awful about leaking, and sometimes you can just turn the bottle a certain way to keep them from leaking, but it is very frustrating to leak your hard-earned breast milk from a poorly constructed bottle. The other reviews are correct unfortunately-the nipples are the best and that is why I continue to use them. My daughter will not take any other nipple even after trying other brands. She likes the advent ones. My recommendation to all moms would be to not even start with the advent ones. I have been told the vent aire from playtex are great and never leak. ???"
2,GOOD QUALITY BUT ANNOYINGLY LEAKY!!!,"I feel like Avent makes good quality merchandise, but I really hate these bottles, namely the nipples. Not only do they leak if not pulled into the collar well enough, but also if the collar is not screwed onto the bottle just so. If you ever need to assemble them while half asleep, that can prove to be quite a mess. Also, as another reviewer stated, the nipples are quite hard and I have found that both my breastfed babies preferred softer nipples, such as Healthflow (disposable) and Playtex disposable wide. I also purchased a million of these bottles to store breast milk, but found it's so much easier to buy milk storage bags and use them with disposable liner-style bottle systems (specifically, Playtex). They thaw quicker when frozen, store in less space, and you don't have to transfer them to a bottle with an acceptable nipple! :o) All in all, if you want a good manual pump, buy the Avent Isis...but I would not recommend the bottles for feeding."
3,"OK Bottles, but not like it claims...","Avent claims to be ""most like breast,"" but I beg to differ. My son has been breast fed since birth (now 4 months old). I came back to work after 6 weeks of maternity leave so my husband and I need to find bottles that were compatible with breastfeeding and tried out many different kinds. The problem with Avent is that the nipple is so hard and makes latching on harder for my son. We still use them because we have 6 of them, but we prefer the Playtex nurser system with the sylicone nipples. They are by far the closest to breast on the market."
2,Too many bubbles!,"I would never reccommend these bottles to anyone. I am a nursing Mother and thought these bottles we suppsose to mimic the breast. They do just the opposite. There were so many bubbles in the bottle that I could hear them...because of this it caused my 3 week old to become gassy and very cranky. I soon switched to playtex nursers and she is great with them. The nipples on the Playtex Nurser are much softer and mimic the breast much more closely than the Avent. Over all, the Avent bottles are a waste of money!"
1,wrong shape nipple for my baby,"My son could not latch on to this bottle's nipple, not because I was using it incorrectly or using the wrong level nipple, but because of it's shape. The milk would run out of the sides of his mouth, and you could tell that he was having a hard time forming his mouth to the shape of the nipple. I switched to the Playtex bottle and their orthodontic nipple,which is designed to fit the shape of a baby's mouth, and you could almost see the relief on my baby's face as he latched onto it perfectly, and he is now able to drink his entire bottle without half of it running down his neck!"
2,These bottles do leak...even when used properly!,"I used these bottles with my second child, and they leaked everywhere. I read some of the other reviews, and I did read the directions correctly and screw the bottles on right, and they still leaked. They also leaked when my husband did it, and when my sister used them for her baby. I do like the bottles, but I hated the fact that it was hit or miss when it came to leaking. The bottles would leak all over my daughter, and she would get extremely upset, and I would get frustrated. I even contacted Avent, and they weren't helpful at all. I would recommend trying another kind if possible."
2,Horrible!,I have a 2 mo old son and was so excited when I saw these...no bags and a wide nipple. I am BF but have to supplement w/formula. These bottles leak everytime I have to use one! And It's not just me...my mom and my husband have made bottles and they leak for them also. I'm doing research on which bottles to try now but I will be so glad when I can throw these in the trash..they have been such a waste of money....and formula!
1,Leaky Bottles,These bottles leak all the time. It seems like you need to put the lid on just perectly so that the milk doesn't come pouring out from the sides. I get terribly frustrated when using them and my son gets frustrated when I take the bottle from him so I can dry him and my carpet off. These bottles are horrible.
1,Avoid anger and frustration do not buy these bottles,"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating."
1,THEY LEAK TOO MUCH,"I, just as the other new moms thought that the Avent bottles were suppose to be really good. Well, let me tell you that they are not. If you don't put the cover on ""just right"" they will leak. I can go just about a whole feeding without it leaking and then right at the end it will leak. I would not recommend these bottles."
2,"Good explanations, bad mathematics","I've read prior reviews of this text and seen the lack of approval, so I wanted to give it a better review, but after doing the reading and the exercises, I'm not particularly impressed. I've already seen the answer key in the back to be incorrect (possibly due to it being a new edition?) as well as a few formula problems (missing a square here or there). Although the explanations are decent, it can be difficult to backtrack to another problem two or three chapters prior and doing a post-hoc test on that data; albeit convenient for the author."
4,Very helpful book,"I used this book in a graduate psychology stats course, and it was a very helpful resource throughout. This book is very text heavy, and is meant to read unlike some other books that may be used as-needed to look information up. The text is a little dry (it's stats, after all) but is easy to get through and understand. The examples were helpful to me in conjunction with my course material. This book might have been less helpful to me outside of a class setting, but I highly recommend it for use with a class or for someone looking for a book to read about statistics."
2,Low quality stats textbook,"If you are a professor looking at this, do your students a favor and don't use this book. It is confusing, difficult to follow, boring, and a waste of money. Every student who has used this book says about the same thing, ""I tried reading it for the first couple weeks but I stopped when it became obvious that I wasn't getting anything from it."" I bet there are many copies of it out there with the first 100 pages highlighted but nothing after that. If you are a student buying this book for a class, I am sorry. I recommend buying supplementary material that is more approachable."
5,"Seasons, 2, 3, 4 & 5","Okay! So DOC is one of the best shows I've seen and I've only managed to see till season 3 (because Australia didn't continue to play it after that). Everyone I've shown season 1 to has loved it all for different reasons. This doesn't negate other fantastic shows, but this one is just different and great...so why on earth have they not yet released the next four seasons! This is crazy...someone please explain to me??"
5,family entertainment,This is very good g rated family entertainment. It has morals. Anyone in the family can sit down and watch this with no problems or worries.
4,"WTF, PUT OUT ALL 5 SEASONS","WHAT THE HELL, WHY IS THERE NOT A SEASON 2,3,4, OR 5. I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD FINALLY RELEASE REST OF THE SEASONS. IT HAS BEEN SO DAMN LONG IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. YOU CAN BUY SEASON 1 BUT NOTHING ELSE, WHAT'S THE POINT OF ONLY RELEASING ONE SEASON. I KNOW THE COMPLETE SEASONS IS BEING REPLAYED ON DISH NETWORK ON CHANNEL 9403. MAYBE THIS WILL INTREST SOME DVD COMPANY AND THEY WILL RE-RELEASE ALL 5 SEASONS."
5,Good Television!,"The first season of ""Doc"" is an outstanding, family-oriented piece of television history. Compassionate, tender, and a little hard-headed, Doc Cassidy's (Billy Ray Cyrus) exploits will touch your heart. There's humor, drama, and adventure in this first season that takes a country doctor out of the wiles of Montana into the heart of New York City. He has an unconventional approach to big city hospital politics (he's not the 1960s Ben Casey or Dr. Kildare) that seems to land him in trouble from time to time, but his practice is straight from the heart. This is great, memorable television, and a bargain to own. Highly recommended!"
5,The best show I've ever watched,"The entire DOC series was a breath of fresh air in the wasteland often called entertainment. Bright, witty, clean, throughtful and filled with solid values. I wasn't sure a show with Billy Ray Cyrus was be something I would like. I was dead wrong. When Doc ended I cried and still feel a huge sense of loss. I'm hope the rest of the seasons come out on DVD. It will be the only show I spend money for ALL the seasons. Great television!"
5,Awesome,I love being able to watch my favorite TV show whenever I want to and commercial free. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is excellent!
5,DOC,"The series ""DOC"" was great. Hopefully the other series will be offered soon. The first season was such a nice series. It was enjoyable to all members of the family, both young & old. Please offer the other episodes of ""DOC""."
5,DOC season!,"All I would like to know is why aren't the other seasons of this show available? I LOVED this show and was very sad when it ended. It is such high quality entertainment that I like re-watching the episodes. The series started out on PAX when I didn't have cable, so I missed a couple of seasons, and I would like to have the whole series so that I could watch them in chronological order. I wish there were more high quality shows like this one. It always had a nice message, and no profanity. Something the whole family could watch together. Sick of all the sit-coms and dramas that are full of profanity and sex. This show never disappoints, and this comes from someone (ME) who was never a big Billy Ray Cyrus fan, until this show."
5,doc season 1,one of the best tv shows ever Billy Ray is at his best in this heart warming family tv series I purchased this because my mother passed away on may 7 2010 and she and I used to watch this series on sunday night on my weekly stop at her house on my way to work so this series has alot of memories for me but it is a great show can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out this is a great one to own.
4,Cheap ink refils for Canon BCI-24 type printers,"I bought these ink cartridges for use with a Canon IP-1500 printer. At $12 for 5 sets (5 black and 5 color), they are about 1/4 the price of Canon brand ink from local retailers. The first set of these tanks I installed worked properly. I printed an 8x8 color photo and it looked good. The tanks snapped into place on the print head with what seemd like as good a fit as the original Canon tanks.I will update this review after all 5 sets of tanks have been used up, with additional comments about long-term quality of the product.UPDATE: June 9, 2009These cartridges didn't last very long, and some of them seemed to be ""dead on arrival"", non-function right after being unsealed from the original packaging and installed in the printer. I won't buy these again, but to be fair, I was never happy with this IP-1500 printer in the first place. It seemed to go through ink cartridges after printing only a handful of pages."
2,Not what I expected :-(,"The beautiful cover that is shown for the item was not included. I received a plain-covered book which, I assume, means it is missing it's jacket. This is disappointing as I chose the book as a coffee table item for it's color appeal."
2,The Lame Ballad of Chasey Lain,"Now don't get me wrong... I like the Gang. And this song is actually pretty damn funny. But only for about a couple of listenings. Bears no repeated listening though. Which is a shame. I mean, it's title is The Ballad of Chasey Lain... smells like an anthem, coulda been a great song, it's already got a great title, but turns out it's only a joke... Nice cover though."
1,another cookbook disappointment,"I was very, very excited to get this cookbook. I am not a vegetarian, but do try to eat vegetarian whenever possible. As a result, I was looking for a good cookbook to increase my options. Many of these recipes are very time consuming and not necessarily worth the time put into them. A lot of the ingredients are also difficult for me to get at my local supermarket. I am still looking for a good, solid vegetarian cookbook."
3,Not as good as others by Madison,"I've made recipes from this book that were good, but I've made more that felt like a lot of effort with little return.On the other hand, I love that Madison suggests wine pairings for the dishes. I don't always have a glass, but I want to complement my meal when I do. I hope Madison includes this feature in all her future publications.I am a fan of Deborah Madison but recommend Vegetarian Cooking, Local Flavors, or even Vegetable Soups over this title.Also, the binding quality on my copy is terrible. I rarely use the book but chunks of pages have fallen out. Perhaps? this problem has since been addressed by the printer, but buyer beware."
3,Good book with some new ideas for meals,"Hey, it's by Deborah Madison, the founder of the Greens restaurant and one of the first really good books on vegetarian cooking so I thought I would give it a try and see what was new.Some basic stuff and some nice new recipes but OH MY GOD! What a horrible cover photograph! Who could forget that almost sexually alluring pictures of her on the cover of Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone? Holding that big spoon and that look of, ""You are going to like this vegetables or I'm going to give you a bare bottom spanking!"" Deborah looks more like Betty Crocker on the cover of this book. For that reason it only gets 3 stars"
1,"Piece of crap version of film, do not purchase","Bought this DVD and went to play it like you normally would. Halfway through the film stops and suddenly returns to the DVD menu. Proceeded to search the scene selections and see that the DVD does in fact stop at that point with no subsequent scenes. Very frustrated and annoyed, I eject the disc and try flipping it and playing the other side. The rest of the film is in fact on the other side, but whoever thought it was necessary to split a 2 hour movie without any extra features between two sides of a disc is a total moron."
5,Karate Kid Thrilled with this product!,"Product arrived timely and in good condition. It is exactly as described and 8 yr old grandson is totally satisfied, as are his parents. It's adjustable and will grow with him for quite a while - good choice!"
5,Perfect for little ones like 5 and under,If you have a little one who needs to practice this is the perfect size...we have the other one and it is to hard for little legs to get over the bottom base but this one is perfect height and is very stable anad made of good quality and is what our dojo Haleys Martial Arts uses...
3,Base not quite heavy enough.,"Even when filled to the max, the unit still moves when my daughter goes to town on it. Maybe she's just a monster."
2,Not what I expected,I chose it because it was very well rated. The base fills with water so that It doesn't fall over. My 9 yo kicks it hard enough that he fears it might fall over and he is a very tiny guy.
5,great for Tae Kwon Do at home practice,"Though it requires more space than we thought, this is a great way to practice Tae Kwon Do at home. Its adjustable to different heights and easy to move by rolling across the floor. But it requires a good deal of space around it for someone to take a big step and swing their leg/arm without hitting anything but the Kid Kick."
4,seems good,"My 7 year old son treats this thing as if its indestructible. He climbs on it, jumps on it, and of course kicks and punches it. It's holding up fine so far even though he's not supposed to be climbing or jumping on it.The wide base is nice and I don't see it as an obstacle or in the way at all.I do wonder if I should have just paid a bit more and got a ""grown up"" quality wavemaster. I see no problems with this one but I'm afraid to use it at all because of the warnings that it's only intended for kids. For another $50 I could have got one that we could all use.For the money spent its good for now. Free shipping and no sales tax is always nice!"
4,Nice product,"Ordered this for my grandsons 4 and 7 for christmas. They love to hit and kick it around. Very durable, seems it will last until they out grow it."
3,theres only one catch,"Lana Turner looks great,the movie is good,Van Heflin is good,BUT Robert Taylorjust doesn't make it as a gangster,especilly compared to classic film Gangsterslike Cagney,Bogart,Robinson,Paulie Walnuts!They would have had better luck casting Taylors wife the great Barbara Stanwyckas the gangster.And the love scenes between Barbara and Lana would have been interesting to say the least!"
4,Mrs,I couldn't imagine how good and comfortable this Brace is! Now I can jog and run with my bad ankle.When I tried to buy it from any Pharmacy - price was almost 4 times more without taxes.Thanks!!!
3,Good in a Way,"This book covers a big gamma of nude photography from old to new and from b&w to color. It is not specific in it nature, except for the nudity. If your are looking for a book that cover every topic of nude photography, this is for you. If you are refined to a specific type of photography, pass on this one."
4,Collages,Collages was a book that anyone who has problems identifying with who they are because of their culture can relate to. I found Collages extremely interesting and life-like. It made the reader question their identity and what two worlds are they divided against. Collages made you question the social groups that we as individuals choose and why. I really loved the sex scenes in the middle of all the chaos and identity crisis there was still room for passion. It was a symbol of acceptance and sacrifies all at the same time.
1,Land of Smiles,"Very Dissapointing:This video was created in 1973, and is very outdated.. The video offers little overview of the actual country, while it does offer insights into the religion of Buddihsm... It was suggested as a ""must see"" for anyone traveling to Thailand... Having researched Thailand on the internet, there is far more to be gained by avoiding this video..."
4,Blue Adept,"A great start to a very good series. If you like a clever blend of fantasy and science, this adventure is for you."
5,crazy...,"My cats love the cat nip, but...the Yeowww!!, is awesome for them. I have 5 indoor cats, and they become crazy when I am applying the cat nip over their beds and cat tree."
1,No effect,"The cat didn't like it. He normally loves fresh catnip. He did not like this variety. He just ignored it, creating a void between us that spans wider and sinks deeper with every passing day."
2,Not very strong.,"My cats are catnip addicts, they absolutely love catnip and go crazy over it most of the time. They didn't like this one very much which I was so disappointed because I was hoping they would like it. I'm going to go back to the catnip I get at my health food store, it is more expensive but it is so much stronger and fresher as well."
3,If you like prose this is your author.,"This is a good book for die hard Kerouac fans. It is a very intheresting view inside the head of one of americas most traveled person. Most of the dreams in the book are releated in scope to his other books. If you are interested in how the hippies got started this is the man to read. He won't tell you how, it will just get you started on their all out mentalty. Everything and anything to the utmost extreme"
5,Photogenic as ever...,"Prince's dramatic nuances, looks, and one of a kind tailor-made outfits make for a very classy and beautiful book of photos of His Royal Badness.Even those who are not a fan of Prince Rogers Nelson's music (although I can't imagine why) will enjoy looking at these sometimes playful, sometimes dirge-like photographs. You will find yourself trying to figure out the soul behind the face of this strange mysterious man.If you appreciate innovative photography and soft male features, this is the book for you.Photography students wil doubtless benefit from these intriguing series of pictures."
5,great,"great book of photography in intimate moments with the most talenteous, genius the Prince of Funk great book too have absolutely for the fans :)"
4,Good atmosphere,"I like this live-album in the extend that it has a fairly good atmosphere, but after listening to this CD, I've learned that live CD's are not quite as good for party-music as it is for rock. The CD contains a good collection of good tracks, and I feel that all the band members has used the chance of playing their instruments to their extends. Especially the bass-player which I am specially impressed by."
2,A huge stack of references,"If you wish to have a useless book with 16 chapters with approximately 50 references per chapter to difficult academic papers (finding these papers is another big problem), with an accompanying text that guide you through these with a lot of photos; than you can buy this one. No mathematical guidence, no backgrounds, no introductory chapters. Just filled with from heaven send formulas, and references. such a complex subject is packed with a 395 pages and named as ""handbook"". You can't learn anything with this one. One star for photos, and one star for the very superficial text accompanying the huge list of references."
2,details laking,"Don't expect to learn much with this book since the topics are discussed only superficially and with many details laking. In the end, if you really want to understand or implement the methods described in the book, you have to read the original papers that proposed the methods. In this sense, it is a good reference book. Another annoying problem is the difference in notation from one chapter to another."
3,personal impression,"Not quite as good as the handbook of fingerprint technology, but still a fairly good summary of the state of the art in todays facial recognition technology. It seemed like it could have been a little deeper in places such as the area of justice with mugshots."
1,Ever Fogged..,"We have a couple pairs of these, they look more happening than other devices out there, seal water fairly well but fog up almost instantly. We followed exact directions to prevent same, bought the exclusive Aqua Sphere Anti-Fog drops, no improvement... Fine for kids in the pool etc. but no good if you're looking for fog free visibility."
3,First Salsa instructional video ??? May have been.,This was the first Salsa instructional video on the market as far as I know. Has been hard to find for years. I have been waiting a decade to watch this video.The cover says it is a promotional copy not for sale? If you can get over the clothes & the white socks this is not a bad beginners video. The styling is over the top for today but some of the moves are nice. Has the best shoulder shakes performance in a video so far. Some of the ladies styling was very good. If you liked the movie buy it. On 2 count for the moves. There is one advanced move I like when they are freestyling at the end.
4,Charles Dickens A christmas carol,Vincent Price does a wonderful job of narration introduction of the movie. It was not as long of a movie as i would have liked but was entertaining anyway..
4,The Christmas Carol,"I love the story to begin with and have been seeking different styles and remakes. This one, though old fashioned, was a true to the letter depiction of the wonderful classic tale. I enjoyed it very much."
3,For Jill St. John fans:,This is Jill St. John's first film role - and not in her credits in IMDB. She plays one of Cratchit's daughters as Jill (different last name). Vincent is supposed to be wicked cutting in his narration. I will be seeing soon!!
3,Vincent Price narrates Charles Dickens' The Christmas Carol,"As one reviewer stated, unless you are a Christmas Carol fan or really like Vincent price, you will not enjoy this version, I got it because I collect various Christmas Carol movies, but I could have skipped this one and not missed out on anything,"
1,Hope you like Green ...,"Okay, so it's old. Beyond old ... petrified. The only reason I bothered is because I love Vincent Price, & he's very amusing. But if you're looking for acting, he does none but narration, & the other characters are terrible. Granted, cramming a whole book into what amounts to merely 25 minutes is next to impossible, so that's pretty well what you got ... next to impossible. The entire episode has turned green, as it was in black & white, but I guess even the film editor got bilious when viewing it.Buy it if you're a collector, but if you're looking for decent Dickens, pass this turkey by."
2,Dickens Christmas Carol,"I have 10 copies of this tale, and they are much newer. I suppose I was expecting more from this copy.This is a little too old. The acting and the staging were antiquated."
5,Lisle 45900 Hood Prop,Product is sturdy and the locking mechanism is tight. Great for its intended purposes.
5,lisle 45900 hood prop,I have only used it a couple times now but it seems very heavy duty and i like that lisle offers replacement lock tabs if needed.
4,Nice book,"Bought this as a gift for my cousin, so dont know much on what the book is about, but my cousin read it and she loved it!"
4,This Book Was So Cool!!!!!,This book is awsome. I couldn't put it down. After I finished rading it I was so freaked out. I couldn't belive what happened to Bobby she was like the main charicter. I'v read all of them except The New Evil and I think that this one is the best. I was so worried about Jinnifer when she came flying out the door of the bus and landed in front of Sarah Fears Gravestone. You have got to read this it is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Dated...but still fun,"Bobbi and Corky join the Shadyside cheerleading team, much to the chagrin of all the other team members, and accidentally unleash an ancient evil. It's Fear Street, for crying out loud. What else could happen?The first time I read this series, I was eleven and whoa, did I love it. Fifteen years later, it's showing its age. I didn't expect I would be wowed again, fifteen years later, but I didn't expect I would cringe with regret, either.Don't take that the wrong way. The book isn't bad. But with the quality of work available to young adults and tweens nowadays, it simply can't stand as high as it used to. The characters are flat, the plot is benign, and the style was apathetic and cold this time around.Bottom Line: It's not good. It's not bad. It's average, but in a 1992 sort of way."
5,Suspenseful!!,"Corky and Bobbi Corcoran are the two new girls on the cheerleading squad at Shadyside High.When they cheer everyone finds out how good they really are.What will Jenifer Daly do to Bobbi when she finds out that Bobbi is the new cheerleading captain?Now some of the strangest things are happening to Bobbi,Corky,and other people of Shadyside High,who could be to blame for the murders?The strange noises,the weird thoughts,and akward actionsof people.What's going on?Could it be the evil spirit of Sarah Fear agian? This book was very interesting and suspenseful I gave it five stars."
5,Each book in this seris gets better and better!!,"This is my absulute ""fave"" book! Every chapter will keep awake a few minutes longer. So don't plan on reading this book all in one night. You'll never get to sleep!!!!"
2,"Fair, Not Good Introductory","It was fair, not all that but fair. Bobbi's death could've been more bloodier, like Chip's death in the second evil. It was uninteresting and I put it down for a month or so because it got so boring, Stine fans would enjoy this. Stine's joke books are better than this crap. But it was fair."
2,"Hey, Mickey, you're so fine","Sister cheerleaders are new to school when the team bus crashes into a haunted graveyard and releases the spirit of one of those pesky Fears. The spirit enhabits head cheerleader, kills off a few other cheerleaders, and goes after the other sister. More of the annoying foreshadowing and giving away of ending. The same circle running garbage that would only be entertaining in video form. When is he going to make a movie about this stuff?"
1,RL watched way too many slasher flicks as a kid....,Either that or he looked at how much $$$$ they made.... This book reads like the sreenplay to a low budget horror film in that the characters are all so banal that you don't mind when they meet terrrible deaths. The plot to all of RL's books? My ---- (fill in the blank) is trying to kill me!!! Stine is the Danielle steel of children's lit!!!! P>s. The scariest part about his book susperstious is the picture of the author on the back!!!!
3,Good but not the best,I bought this for my niece when she got her green belt - she definitely loves it! Since then I have found other belt displays that are better quality. Next time I'll buy one with the elastic loops to hold the belts in place. This is good for a child...but if you're looking for a longer term and nicer display go look and see what Century has (they sell tons of Martial Arts Equipment) - I think Amazon also has a few like that in their Martial Arts section.
1,Belt display,"I am returning this item. I bought it for a 10 year old, and I will not give it to him as it is not as expected at all. It is made up of 10 pieces of plastic with sharp edges (I cut myself just handling it) that attach together with metal hooks. I will look at the wooden racks instead."
4,"Looks good, kinda hard to put together","This display came quickly and looked just as it does online. It's exactly what we needed to organize the growing collection of belts we have in our home. Our son is very proud of the display and it was easy to hang in his room. The clips that hold the belts to one another are a little tricky to hang onto one another, but I think it was because I put the belts on the base before clipping them together. Would have been helpful if there were some directions included, but after the first couple belts, it made much more sense and was a little easier."
1,Cheaply made,"This was of poor quality, it had stickers that had to be placed on by the consumer, and the dragons were flimsy and bent, I could have made a better product with scrap wood around my shop."
4,nice display,This is a nice way to show off my 7 year old son's belts. The flags are stickers so they are not as nice as it should be - but the overall rack looks good once it is put together. It is hard to attach the belt straps - but once I figured it out it moved along faster.
3,Covers the whole window,I like my sunshade a lot. It goes up easy and down. The only thing I don't like is trying to roll it up...it's a little hard.
3,Not for the Experienced,"This book is not really for someone who has any experience in the world of online sales. With over 5 years experience in this field, I really did not learn anything new from this book. I could see a beginner finding use from what is discussed in this book, but if you already have experience with eCommerce, this book is not for you."
4,WHEN will this become avialable on DVD...?,"Watching/listening to this on VHS tape is a shame. This production deserves full video and audio reproduction to COMPLETELY capture all the nuances, colors, sounds, and majesty of this amazing performance."
5,A Masterpiece,"I was totally spellbound when I saw this. It is a breathtaking masterpiece that integrates visuals, sounds and SPIRITUALITY, to create every mans journey from outer worldliness into the inner world of Spirit. Peter Buffet is a brilliant artist that obviously knows Sacred Unity, as do all the performers in this piece. This one speaks to the soul! If I could give it 10 stars I would. Buy It!!!!!!"
5,Never have I been so spiritually moved.,"After catching the last 30 minutes of SPIRIT on PBS, I was so moved that I had to get my own copy of the video and CD. I am of Cherokee and Irish decent and found the underlying message of lost heritage, rediscovery, rebirth, and reincorporation to be personnally revealing.I actually felt the native drums tugging at something deep within. The comingling of contemporary and native music and costume was a feast for the senses and the Chief's narrative added just the right touch. ""Wa-Doo' to Buffett."
5,"When I saw this video on PBS, I knew I had to have it.","Quite by accident, I turned to PBS when this video was being shown. I was hooked in the time it takes to think, ""I wonder what this is?"" I started a search and found the CD, ordered it and listened to it. Though the CD is great, it is not enough! I must have the video! The blend of modern and ancient instruments along with the dance will reach into anyone's musical soul!"
2,"The show is fantastic, the video disappoints","The video was filmed in 1998, I saw the show in 1999. The show's a spectacular treat, lavish costumes and incredible performances by musicians and dancers alike. But the video is radically edited down to 45 minutes of show content from 105 minutes of live performance. The 30 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage helps, but doesn't make-up for the sense of loss.Save your money and go see it live!"
5,Spirit,This is an awesome movie. Have been looking for it for years!!!! 5 Stars! Recomend it to anyone who enjoys beauty!
2,Video abridges the best parts,"After being astounded by seeing Spirit in person, I ran out and immediately ordered the video. Upon receiving the video, I was very disappointed. The video is only about 45 minutes, followed by a 30 minute documentary on the making of the show. The actual stage version is about 90 minutes, so half the show never even made it to the video cassette. They need to do what Riverdance did a few years back and release a 2nd version of the video with the complete performance."
5,The most awesome visual and aural experience of a lifetime.,"If you have ever watched a ""cowboy and indian"" movie and rooted for the indians. If you have seen ""Dances with Wolves"" more than once and cried each time. If you have ever felt a unknown stirring and yearning for peace with nature then you must see this video.It takes you vicariously on a spiritual journey. It awakens your roots, like an eagle, it lifts you up carries you to a higher place. It puts order into your yearnings. Your heart beats with the drums. Your feet move to a dance never before felt. Your voice yearns to cry out in joy.When this country was first settled, our white ancestors went about educating and civilizing the natives found here. Now the circle is complete and it is time for then to educate and civilize us. Spirit Dance is a great place to start."
2,Some Pretty Basic Stuff,"If you are looking for a book that documents some pretty basic games in an interesting and attractive format, this is the book for you. While there were some new ideas, I found that many of the activities were pretty basic and not worth the price of the book: Tickle Me; Mirror, Mirror (both for children younger than the title suggests); Dressing Up; Color Sorting; and Blowing Bubbles (for kids over two). I'm sure I'll use the book on a rainy day when I am desperate and out of ideas, but I wanted a book of new, creative activities that we could add to our basic list of favorites."
5,Awesome book by an awesome warrior.,"This book by Miyamoto Musashi is really cool. It tells you about fighting tecniques, how to keep your cool in battle, and alot more. If you're into feudal Japan, bushido, or samurai, then you'll love this book. Also, be sure to check out The Hagakure, (I have the edition translated by D.E. Tarver), and Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa. I myself am in the middle of reading Musashi, which I highly reccomend you buy, but don't let the books large size scare you, it's great."
5,Well written,"This is an excellent read period, many times books like this get slow & stilted in the translation, this one doesn't, its bottom line format using minimal words for maximum effect really allows the reader to absorb the translators and Musashi's intent, that of sharing Musashi's Wisdom. Very Well Done."
5,"An enjoyable, engaging translation!","I've read several editions of ""The Book of Five Rings"" and this is by far my favorite. Not being fluent in Japanese, I can not comment on the word choices specifically, but the book is a fluid read. The author helpfully breaks down the translation into smaller sections within each chapter and this adds to the readability as well. The book itself is an interesting blend of martial arts philosophy, life wisdom, and sword technique. As someone studying kendo (Japanese fencing) I turn to this book to add some insight and enjoyment to my studies. I've also read this author's translation of ""The Hagakure"" and enjoyed that as well. My sense is that he went for an accurate but readable translation, informed by his own martial arts experience, without putting too much of his own ""spin"" on things. A good book and a good read, I highly recommend this edition!"
3,Complaint about some blank pages,"I thought I received the book ordered having missing pages. I complain you about this problem. Then, You sent me the same other book. However, after I checked the book, it had the same problem with the first book before. So, I conclude that the publisher let the book have the pages like this (not missing pages, but only blank pages)."
4,oud master,"Anouar Brahem is a Tunisian who is one of the leading present exponents of the oud, a lute-like stringed instrument. Brahem's music is anything but 'exponent'-sounding, however--he makes regular excursions into the world of jazz and crossover (a project of some years back with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek was wonderful), along with recording pieces with a more traditional sound. This cd is langorous and exotic-sounding with a good bit of a jazz feel thrown in for good measure; it is mostly quiet, introspective and wandering (even ambient), with occasional explosions of what might be termed ""rhythmic urgency."" It frankly takes a bit of getting used to, but if you like unpretentious, intimate music and can get into this particular blend of North African instrumentation (oud, clarinet, nai flute, and bendir and darbouka), you may well find it very attractive."
1,canceled my order without reason.,"this company posted the watch for $9.99 but cancelled my order the next day. i would understand if it was a typo or any thing, they should have given me a reason for the cancellation of order. i would have been ok if there was any communication at all. i suggest not to do business with this very inferior company."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"This watch was advertised for $10, so I went ahead and purchased it as it looked like a good deal, despite the fact that the face was an ugly color of orange, but anyhow, the next day they send me an e-mail stating simply that the purchase was canceled by this watch company. I should have known, because they have the poorest satisfactory rating of any website I have ever seen on Amazon. And I think I read some reviews on their Feedback Page of this happening to other people, although I am not sure it was on this specific product. Anyhow, don't get your hopes up for anything special from these jokers!"
4,Kali Sulph.30x,This product is very good when you have a cold.It helps to reduce mucus and helps to stop running and blocked nose
4,Simple but specific,"Marty has written this book from the background of being a sudccessful entreprenuer on several fronts. Marty has the ""gift of Gab"" and it comes across in his book in such a way that makes it an enjoyable read. I don't underline all the books I read but my copy has many underlines in it as it is full of ideas and thoughts that you can ""take to the bank"". 9 Simple Steps is a good read if you have a business, are thinking of starting one, or know someone who is and likes ideas on success from someone who is."
5,"Founder and President, Decra-Scape, Inc.","People will soon be accrediting The 9 Super Simple Steps as a huge part of their claim to fame. This is most definitely a great place to start for any aspiring entrepreneur, young or old. This book will get your system firing on all cylinders and provide you with the necessary inspiration you need to get out there and pursue your dreams. I only wish this book was available 13 years ago when I got started in business! I've learned there is no magic formula or secrets to success only determination and patience coupled with some good ole hard work. With the help of this book there will be no need to reinvent the wheel. Get started today and GOOD LUCK!"
4,Great Starter Deck.,This is the deck I learned on. I like it that all the cards have pictoral symbolism on them. Great deck to start your studies with before you move on to a deck you find intuitively and artisticly inspiring.
4,Rider Waite Tarot Cards,"These cards were exactly what was expected. Beautiful deck, the reverse side is a little dull non the less still a great buy. The down side is the book that comes with it. the descriptions are very vauge with not alot of detail. I would recomend these cards to any level tarot reader. I would recomend purchasing an additional book to go with them."
3,It's a classic,"This was my first deck of tarot cards, purchased under the impression that I should begin with the original standard. I've used it quite extensively but it never appealed to me--I even delayed delving into tarot because of how much this deck turned me off. So I just wanted to speak up for anyone else new to tarot who might have similar feelings as I did. My advice: buy a deck that resonates with you from the beginning. If it's this one, put it in your cart already; if it's not, choose a different deck."
5,Easy to learn and the best deck.,"If you get ""The Complete Guide to the Tarot"" by Eden Grey, then you will have no trouble learning to use and interpret these cards. They are an invaluable aid to spiritual discovery. Don't let anybody talk you out of trying them because they are too hard or don't work. They do work and you can learn."
5,best tarot deck for beginners,"This is the best tarot deck for beginners and even intermediate and advanced readers love it. It is a classic deck and the one everybody things about when they think of tarot. If you see tarot cards on television, this is the deck used.This deck makes a great gift. It has beautiful art work, a small book which shows the meanings of the cards as well as a card with the history of the deck. I found this especially interesting and it made me love the deck even more!"
4,Nice Deck,"I got exactly what I was looking for, a nice deck that already possessed inate powers. A precision tool to be used and treasured. Deadly Accurate."
5,Great Cards,I'm learning how it read these cards. And I love working with them. Having a lot of fun.
4,The standard...and for good reason,"As for many others, the Rider Waite deck was my first Tarot deck. It's probably -the- best deck for beginners to cut their teeth on due to its rich symbolism. Even without reading page one of any Tarot book on the market, most any intuitive person can form reasonably accurate interpretations of nearly all these cards. The illustrations are simple, yet powerful, drawing on universal archetypes that guide the reader to the wisdom that already lies in his/her subconscious.It isn't a perfect deck (though I believe the only ""perfect"" deck would be one that one designed for oneself), but of all the decks I own, it's one of the very few that almost always ""speaks"" to me. And it speaks to me accurately. I highly recommend this deck for both beginners and experienced readers."
4,excellent starter set,"I have had a passing interest in Tarot for awhile, but had not really considered actually purchasing a deck until I received an Amazon.com gc. I decided to go ahead and purchase this set as it was so basic. The pictures are nice and the deck is easy to manipulate. I was a little disappointed with the back of the cards though, blue plaid..what were they thinking? To put together blue plaid with the beauty of the cards faces..bad choice. Of course it doesn't affect the cards functionality :) I just would have chosen a different set had I known... Either way I love to practice tarot and these cards were a good choice."
2,One small problem: the backs are ugly!,"The obverse of these cards are gorgeous, just as the Rider Waite cards should be. However, the reverses are just plain ugly, with a sort of plaid geometric pattern in blue and black on them. I was very disappointed, as I expected the reverses to be as attractive as the obverses, but the designs don't match at all. I'm looking for another with a better design, perhaps the Universal Waite."
4,Quality Tarot deck,This book is well written and quite informative.It is a book for any one who is interested inlearning about Tarot cards and how theycan be used.
4,The classic deck in a pouch-able size.,"I like this deck a lot - it's the standard Rider-Waite-Smith deck, sized down to 'pocket size'. I usually carry it in my pouch for use in in-situ readings.The two drawbacks I see in this deck are :- The little white book isnt the same size as in the miniature deck (which is rather small).- The cardbox isnt glued well and is a bit larger than the cards, so it's ruined quickly."
3,Not for me,"I got these cards as a birthday present from my best friend when I was 12. I am now 26 and still have them and they're in great shape for their age.I am not very fond of these cards personally, they always kind of creeped me out. And the descriptions of each card's meaning in the little book that comes with the deck are pretty difficult to understand, since the vocabulary is a little outdated.However, if you're just getting started with the Tarot, this is a good deck to start with. I'd just recommend looking up the cards' meanings somewhere other than the included book."
3,its pretty good,i just bought it today and it is pretty good.i had a little hard time understanding the meanings but that is becuase i am a beginner and i have not had much experience. but for the most part its pretty good. the art on it is ok. its nothing too special but i would recomend it.
1,The Rider Waite Tarot Deck,I know there are many people who love this deck but I am not one of them. The drawings are too basic to capture my attention and admiration. I prefer a much more modern and artistic deck than this one.
4,"Basic, and gets the job done.","These cards are very useful for average tarot readings. They are basic enough for a beginner, but have symbolisms that can still astound a seasoned reader."
3,An OK deck,"When I become interested in a subject, I research it. The Tarot is no different. I bought this as my first deck based on the reviews here at amazon, and in various books and online sources. The symbolism is very rich, but i found it incredibly difficult to read and interpret. The reason is a simple matter of personal aesthetics: the cards are ugly. Because I didn't like them, I fought them every step of the way. Because of the rich symbolism, this is a very good deck for a seasoned expert, or someone who likes to look at them, but they are definitely not for me."
5,These Cards Are Beautiful!,"I just received the cards today, and I LOVE them! The images are beautiful, and the finish and stock are both nice. I even like the back design, which, according to at least one source, was the original design. I also like the little book that came with the cards. It should be interesting and informative. This is my first tarot deck, and I got it more for contemplation and meditation than for divination. I looked at many different decks, and this one just stood out. It is the only one with which I was previously familiar, and I decided it was the one I liked the most. I think I made the right choice. I would highly recommend this product."
5,"great, good for beginners","This is my first (and only) tarot deck. It is great for beginners and average face-to-face tarot readings. There ar many who don't care for the Rider deck, because some of the depictions and symbolism are heavily Christianized."
5,Rider Waite Tarot Deck,"I recently bought several decks of the Rider Waite Tarot for a class I am teaching. I choose this deck for students because the images are a big part of understanding the meaning of each card and the Rider Wait images are by far the easiest to understand. Do not mistake my description of the images being ""easiest to understand"" as a statement that this deck is a ""beginners"" deck, I've been reading Tarot for around 20 years and still learn from this deck every time I use it.In my oppinion, the Rider Waite Tarot deck is the best all around tool for Tarot divination."
5,"Everything you need to know is in this book, just read and learn.","Everything you need to know is in this book, just read and learn. From the very begining to the end. Just pick your own strategy and have fait and patience."
3,A Small Warning,"This is a useful book, but potential buyers might want to consider that it was originally published (in hardback) in 2001. The 2004 paperback at hand appears to have few or no textual differences from the original edition. Thus investors and potential investors who want to see some factoring-in of the 2007-2008 housing depression and ensuing stock market crash might be disappointed. Even the most general and theoretical work can be helped with a little real-world reference, because it's from the real world and not spreadsheets that profit is taken, if there's any to be ""took"" ;)"
2,There are much better titles available,"Half of the book is a history of several value investors. But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did. Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves. The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies. Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company). I recommend instead ""The Intelligent Investor"" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig. It lives up to Buffett's praise of ""...by far the best book about investing ever written."""
5,Review of the Revue.,"It's been a long time since I instantly fell in love with a band, but that's what happened when I saw them play about five songs a couple of months ago. I'm not sure I am capable of describing why this album is so good, just that it is completely amazing from start to finish. It also doesn't hurt that thier live shows sound incredible and images of Skip's jumps, Jeff and Nick's sweet shirts, Timshel's adorableness, and Logan's rhythms just makes me wish I'd been at the Cat's Cradle on June 22nd. I'm so excited to have found this band."
1,Fantastic!,This is a really fantastic book and one of the best book I have read.All the animal lovers must read it.
5,Definetly the Best,I've played all paintball games out there and they are all the same. Except this one. I find that it's the Goldeneye of Paintballing. If you're going to buy a Paintball game I highly suggest you get this one. My only problem with this game is that it doesn't have Multiplayer.
5,The best game of them all,This is a good game but it shouldn't be rated T because there is no cursing or vilonce this is a really alsome game!!
1,Way less than promised,"I have been playing paintball for a few years now, so it was no surprise for me when I purchased this software game, I wanted to be able to some what enjoy paintball in those days that weather or other reasons prevent me from going out to play. To make story short, I was very disappointed from this games. The control makes the picture jump, there is no real way to aim, and in many scenarios you have no idea what is going on. Bottom line, I was dissatisfied."
5,Corner Stone,"A superb guide to the intricacies of the Chinese economy. I highly recommend it to students, professionals, policy makers, and academics looking to better understand the underlying themes and trends of the world's fastest growing economy.Erik Lundh,Washington, DC"
3,Old Friends and New Fancies:,"I found the story to be all over the place. It is based around the love lives Georgiana Darcy, Kitty Bennett,and Colonel Fitzwilliam. I found that there were too many of the characters from other books and that the story was extreamly poor the I could make out the ending before I got to it. I am extreamly glad now that I have not wasted my money on this book but managed to borrow it from a friend. The best characters were mentioned occasionally Elizabeth and Darcy were in the book but hardly mentioned. Altogether it was a total disappointment"
4,Old Friends and New Fancies by Sybil G. Brinton,"Who was this mysterious Sybill G. Brinton? History records very little about her more than her dates of birth and death. She was childless and no known photograph of her exists! What a shame she never wrote anything else. I found her book to be delightful. All the major Jane Austen characters are back and no one, by the end of the book, remains single. Because this book was written in 1913 (says so on the cover), the turn of phrase and general style is much more like Jane's than anything these modern day Jane Wannabe's come up with. But being so much closer to our time, the prose is very comfortable for the modern reader. I found the book to be very pleasant and never ridiculous. I highly recommend this to any fan of Jane Austen. I thoroughly enjoyed it"
2,Trying too hard,"This book is only worth reading if you are a Jane Austen fanatic like myself. If you just have to get more of your favorite characters you might enjoy this. It has charcters from all of Jane Austen's completed novels except Lady Susan. It is primarily concerned with the love lives of Georgianna Darcy, Col. Fitzwilliam and Kitty Bennett so it is mainly a Pride and Predjudice sequel. What I did not like about the book was that it tried too hard to include too many characters from too many novels. There are so many characters in the book that many of them have become rather bland. If you love Jane Austen and can never get enough you may enjoy this book. If you're not a die hard fan this probably isn't for you. There are several better written sequels than this one."
4,large fountain pump,I have used many types of pumps in the past but this one has out performed the rest of them.
1,koss ur-15c,save your bucks from this poor quality product. I bought it @ walmart and one side couldn't work just after one month of use. I would recommend on sony or panasonic.
1,Another Waste of Money,"Brand new, and the Koss UR-15 headphones were putting crackling static into my left ear when the music was at a moderate volume or higher. I tapped the left side with my finger, and it died! This review is my revenge, and your warning. The earbuds that came with it were just as disappointing. They had no bass sound at all, and sounded tinny. Even the cheapest earbuds sound richer. AVOID KOSS!"
2,Just OK,"The scenery was nice, and no doubt, there's some knowledge here, but overall, I was disappointed. My predominant thought was that this was a nice little home movie, and that any sales proceeds would likely help to fund this couple's next adventure - thanks, but I'd rather spend the money to pay for my own."
5,Molten Metal from Sinner with their heaviest album to Date,"Sinner have really turned up the metal factor on this release. There arn't so many sing along choruses as on earlier albums, it's more about great riffing and chugging rhythm guitar.In many ways Sinner reminds me of Primal Fear which isn't suprising considering Mat Sinner who is the brains behind Sinner is also in Primal Fear. Both bands feature the same huge 'wall of guitars' sound. I would recommened this album to anyone who loves balls out heavy metal. Best songs are Higher Level of Violence and Reqiuem for a Sinner.I think this album has the most in your face mid heavy guitar sound I have ever heard, it is incredible!!"
3,Do you like beatbox punk?,"This is a small compilation of Ludwig Von's antics and personality. I like the old early to mid Eighties beatbox punk and they are one of the best. The better songs are ""Twist a Kuweit City"" and ""Cannibis"". If you were to buy one Ludwig Von album, buy ""Houlala"" It's classic violent screaming vulgarities may even offend people who love the content of the Sex Pistols. Not for the weak!"
4,Lightweight and very portable,"I bought the Dk-5 because I found that all Combi products are lightweight and portable. DK-5 is superior than the Cosmo in terms of build quality and maneuverrability. The car seat is very well cushioned. The egg shock is a great add-on. The car seat, car seat base and the stroller snap in easily. You can attach/remove the car seat from the stroller/car seat base, in a matter of a few seconds.Drawbacks:The mesh basket is very small and we couldn't fit a normal diaper bag in it.Car seat is small in size compared to other car seats. Removing the infant seat will fit babies who are 4 months and older easily. Anyone who is taller than 5ft 7in will have problems maneuvering the stroller because their feet will frequently hit the wheels of the stroller. I wish this stroller came with a add-on snack tray."
5,Classic...,"For mid-80's ""industrial"" (or what we used to call industrial), this album is unbelievable - it's a Must Have, along with Minstry's Twitch. Seriously, you don't get the music that set the stage for Nine Inch Nails if you don't have this album. Brilliant (and this from a guy who was in Chicago in the mid-80's at clubs like Medusa's, Cabaret Metro/Smart Bar, Exit Club, etc.)."
1,Nice idea needs help,"It's a cool idea, but the strips of tape provided to hold the belts on only held on my son's belts for about a week before they started to come undone. It's also hooked together with open ended type c-clips. I ended up taking it down, using thin ribbon to securely tie the belts on the rack and wire the racks together with floral wire, which is not coming loose. It's cool to be able to display the belt certificate- but overall this product needs to be reworked."
1,Not as nice as the picture,"I am truely disappointed with this item. It does not look at all as the picture, in fact it look terrible! It do not keep the belts in place and what suppose to be a cover for a picture is just a piece of plastic in bad chape and not even cut right..... A shame on you, Marcial Arts for selleing such a joke."
2,looks can be deceiving,"This belt plaque looked great in the picture and held as many belts as I needed to display. Now that it's here, I can't figure out how to put it together and it looks so flimsy that I 'm not sure it's worth the effort of trying to figure it out;"
3,belt holder,"this product is just ok. when I went to put this product together the craftsmanship was not the best. The pre-drilled holes in the plexie glass did not line up with the pre-drilled holes in the wooden plaque, they were 3/4 of an inch off. This is one of those cases where you get what you pay for."
1,Big disappointment.,"Beware! This product is not as advertised. It does not have a frame, but rather a poorly-finished board with plexiglass over it. The board arrived broken into 2 pieces and the plexiglass scratched beyond use. When attempting to return it, the vendor said they sell about 10 per day...how many are returned? Mine was for sure."
2,Nothing but for the great Ducati,"Not much of a movie. Acting was bad. Plot was rough. Yet Kristi Ducati (aka Melissa in that cenimatic masterpiece ""The Bikini Carwash Company"")was in it, so I watched it. Go figure. She gives it its two stars."
2,An OK direct to video Erotic Thriller,"This direct to video Erotic thriller is a OK thriller.There's a couple of nude scenes done by the main star(the boyish hairy Larry Poindexter) and a few women.If you like to watch these kinds of DVD's buy this DVD.Be prepared for a ton of plot holes.The only problems I have with this DVD is it's pan/scan,no trailers and no captions. Even though this stuff is not on the DVD,it's a great transfer. if you can handle ""black bars"" on the side of your TV,instead of the side.buy this DVD.I'd doubt you can find this DVD for rent/to buy at a local video store.Buy it for the nudity and the OK story....Somewhere in this movie is the producer,has anyone spotted him yet?"
2,cast is too damn old!,"Listen, the actors performing here are all outstanding. The problem is that the script was written for a group of much younger men.I mean, come on! George C. Scott in Lee Cobb's original role does that corny, over-acted ending about being stabbed with the knife by his son - he looks like he's in his '90s here -What's his son? Seventy? Get over it, George! It's just ridiculous.Forget this film - see the play or buy the original film."
5,An excellent study of small group interaction!,"This is an excellent re-make of the original movie (starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb). The plot is moved into a more contemporary setting that shows current feelings and prejudices that drive people's opinions and close their minds.The story is an outstanding example of the different personalities and self-appointed roles that become evident in a small group trying to come to a concensus. The attitude and behavior of the jurors, cooped up in a sub-standard room, are made very obvious immediately. Private agendas, however, take much longer to surface.""12 Angry Men"" puts the American Judicial system on trial. The plot illustrates, very painfully, just how poorly some citizens take their responsibilities in as significant a case as one that involves capital punishiment.The cast is excellent."
3,Not a bad remake...but why?,"The original ""12 Angry Men"" is a classic, with powerful performances by an amazing cast (many at the time, unknown), along with brilliant camera work and direction. Why then was it ever remade? Did they think they could better the original? Well, they didn't, and anyone who tries in the future, won't. And as good an actor as Jack Lemmon is, it was never so evident that he is no Henry Fonda.I'll admit that the cast for this remake is very good throughout (the performance of the ad agency character is at least on par, if not better, than the original). However, none of the other performances quite matched their counterparts, and the direction and camera work doesn't even come close. While the original ""12 Angry Men"" jumped off the screen, this remake seemed to just sit there.Between 1 and 10, the remake of ""12 Angry Men"" gets a marginal 6. If you've never seen the original, do yourself a favor and rent it. It is a far superior film."
3,A re-make that doesn't measure up.,"While the re-make of the 1957 original is a compelling film, the chemicstry of the cast does not measure up to Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, et al. Stick with the original if you really want to feel the power of this dramatic film."
2,"This is good, so is the original.","George C. Scott is brilliant, his talent is obvious in this screen version of the play."
1,One Angry Reviewer,"No amount of money or updating can master the original12 Angry Menmasterpiece. Although I really like George C. Scott's role that Lee J. Cobb originated, I see nothing redeeming in this remake. Jack Lemon's talents are wasted in this film and he is actually a poor choice for the role. I would have preferred someone like Tom Hanks in Fonda's original role.In addition, the senseless foul language added to the original script does nothing for the film except ""update"" it a bit with how we speak today, but it still reeked as being unnecessary. William Friedkin is a very skilled director (The Exorcist,The French Connection, et. al.), but this is just not his genre at all and, therefore, his talents are wasted as much as everyone else's in this remake."
5,Excellent Educational Tool,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this video. It was masterfully acted and produced. I used this video in my American Government classroom at the end of the Judicial Branch unit to help my students see a different side of the Judicial system. I highly recommend this video to any teacher looking for a decent video to use in their American Government classroom.
3,Doesn't stand up to the original,"Despite fine performances by all, especially Jack Lemmon in the Fonda role, this remake does not even come close to the original. It lacks the punch of the original and not all the actors meet the standards set by the original actors. Even the great Hume Cronyn, as good as he is, doesn't compare to his predecessor. Maybe I am disappointed in this movie because I saw the original first and judge it by that standard. On it's own, it's not a bad film but once you've made a classic why remake it? Do you really think you can get it better. Don't waste your money. Buy the original."
3,Reviews are not about the product being offered!,These reviews are about the older version of this movies with Henry Fonda. This is the remake with Tony Danza. Not the same movie.
3,"A little to ""COLORFUL""!","The cast in this film was not the best, don't get me wrong George C. Scott, Jack Lemmon, & Hume Cronyn are wonderful in this movie, but the rest of the cast was not very good at all. As for it being to ""COLORFUL"" it had to many African Americans and they were very rude to the white cast in the film. I think your best sticking with original from '57 with Henry Fonda. If your just buying it for the reasons I did for George C. Scott, Jack Lemmon, & Hume Cronyn you'll like their acting only they are the only 3 good preformers in the film."
3,Why the remake ?,"I give this movie 3 stars because i can't understand why they made the remake. First off, the story, the lines and everything else is exectly the same. Second acting doesn't measure up to the original, the original has far superios arcting, it exploded off the screen. So, why would anyone try to re-make 12 angry men ? it's the same as someone would go out and re-do casablanca horribly,"
2,"Come on everyone, you can't be serious","With all due respect to the other reviewers of this film, I must nonetheless admit to being baffled by some of the contributions here. Even to think of remaking Sidney Lumet's 1957 version is sacrilege but to actually go ahead and do it is incomprehensible. Whatever the merits of this film -- irritatingly made to fit in with P.C. faddishness -- it will always be compared to the original and how anyone can make a favourable comparison again I find hard to understand. The 1957 version is one of the greatest feats in cinema history not because of the special effects but rather because of the lack of them. What a gamble to make a film entirely (barring two shots)set in one dull, stuffy room but it was a gamble that paid off. One of the truly great but criminally underrated films of all time. Watch the original and shun the remake."
4,An almost required add-on,"Because of the longevity that this add-on gives the core game of Battlelore, I would say that any fan of the original game should purchase it. That being said, it simply replaces a point-buy system for a random card deployment system (which can be random and not so balanced) and does not add any new units (do not expect to get any more armies in this one). Also, a tad pricey."
3,not as good as it could have been,"I was a bit disappointed with this toy because it had great potential but was lucking in certain areas. The good side is that it is cute and everything can be easily stored in the box. It can also be used in the bath (if you take out the firefly bug that lights up). My daughter (15 mo old) generally likes it. But there are a couple of issues with it: the handle is not long enough to be of any use; it didn't have the blue shovel shown in the picture; the firefly bug works only sometimes, when it hits the bottom really hard. ALso, I was expecting the top slots to discriminate bugs by size or shape, but that is not the case. Any bug can fit in any hole, so it misses a good oportunity for extra fun. Overall, I kept this toy because my daughter liked it a bit and she can use it in her bath, but I don't think it will keep her attention for very long."
3,Cute but my boys were too old,I got this for my twin boys that just turned two. They liked it for about five minutes. I think it was too basic for them. I think it would be better for a younger child
3,Needs More,I found that this book had a lot of basic start-up information but not enough in regards to running an auto detailing business and absolutely no instruction on how to do a detail. I would recommendThe Profitable Auto Detail Shop - How to Start and Run a Successful Auto Detailing Business.
4,"Great guy, great book","Having had the pleasure of talking to the author, I can tell you that there's no doubt where the voice in this book came from. Mr. Perkins is an upbeat, motivational, excitable guy, and it comes through in his writing. Some parts are a bit repetitive, but charmingly so. It's like reading the journal of a good friend who has been through a tough time and has inspired you with his strength.It's a quick read, and worth the time to put a smile on your face. Get a copy, enjoy it, then recommend it to a friend."
3,Man in the Box,"Can't really say I am a fan of this cd, but this guy can really dish it out. Go onto windows media player, go into ""guide,"" and puch in ""man in the box."" Find his cover of it, and you'll know what I mean. Does an awesome take for alice in chains."
3,An essential little book IF you are traveling to Mykonos...,"I wanted to love this book. Like so many others I long to experience the magic of Mykonos and opted for this book as a surrogate. It is well written, but it is more for the reader interested in Greek history than those who expect to discover the essence of an island, a haven, a fantasy. Highly recommended as a suitcase tuck if you're planning a vacation to the Greek Islands, but if you crave the flavor of the place this is a disappointingly dry read."
3,Beach reading,"James Davidson has written two books both aimed at a general readership, not only the academic world (""Courtesans and Fishcakes"" 1999, ""The Greeks and Greek Love"" 2009). The former received good reviews, and the latter some mixed reactions. This shorter book defies classification. It reads as a series of meditations on the landscape of the Aigean Sea from the beaches of Mykonos. He seamlessly combines the the history of the neighboring Greek isles and the mainland with the myths of creation and the holiday of a knowledgeable, vacationing traveler. The subtitle ""Being Ancient, Being Islands, Being Giants, Being Gay"" is either a sort of table of contents or a else a kind of abstract for the rest of the book. One part travelogue, one part guidebook, one part stream of consciousness and two parts history makes for a nice diversion. Sit on the beach and read about better ones a long time ago and a world away."
3,ok,"This game looks ok. It is cheaper than the tony hawk games, but I don't think the quality is as good. I'd rather save my money for something that's better made, like tony hawk's pro skater 2. I think there would be more detail than this one. It looks decent, I guess. You decide!"
2,"mixed feelings, uncertainty...just like this book!","Though this book does get off to a slow start, it can be credited to the mood being established by Gibson. 19th-Century Ontario is a slow moving place, and Gibson's lack of break-neck action serves well here. However, I do agree that the book never does pick up the pace. Instead, we are treated to seemingly random vignettes of strange occurrences in and around the Fraser homestead in southern Ontario. There are certain gothic elements to this tale: family dysfuncion, madness, violence, and a perpetual feeling of uncertainty. That's what this book left me with: I was uncertain about where it would eventually lead. When it got to the end, the feeling persisted. A strange work, but not worth high praise."
2,Do not read this book unless you have to!,This book got off to a slow start and remained so throughout the book. It was really boring and fairly difficult to follow. I would advise anyone to not read this book unless you like 1920's stories of an inventor.
5,An Unsurpassed Debut,"Ms. Aitken brilliant debut is a wonderful tale of romance, suspense, adventure and intrigue. While this novel is classified as a romance, it is so much more. A Love Beyond Time captivates you from the opening pages and never lets you go. She has cleverly woven factual historical occurrences in a tale of love, desire and destiny. Her characters are in the same instance both heroic and yet down to earth. Ryan Burke captured my heart from the very first time I was introduced to her. I am sure this is only the first of many wonderful adventures that Ms. Aitken is bound to take us on."
5,You will be spellbound from page one!,"Judie Aitken's Native American background brings this book to life, lending a personal perspective, brushing life onto the canvas of the book's pages. For readers who are thirsty for a captivating time travel, ""A Love Beyond Time"" will keep you spell bound from page one. Aitken weaves in elements so skillfully that the reader will finish the book with an ""ahhhh"" feeling. Keep your eye on this writer, she has the makings of the next Constance O'Day Flannery."
5,A Bravura Debut!,"Judie Aitken's A LOVE BEYOND TIME is a bravura debut! I was completely enchanted with her storytelling, superb prose, and exquisite depiction of the Lakota ways. Though history tells us the outcome of the Little Big Horn battle, Ms. Aitken's thrilling depiction of the events will keep you turning pages. Lakota warrior, Wolf, is a hero to die for -- one whose tipi I wouldn't mind sharing! A LOVE BEYOND TIME is a magical, enthralling novel that will touch the hearts and minds of all romance readers."
5,Wonderfull story,Judie really brings her characters to life. The love Ryan and Wolf share really does transend time It bought tears to my eyes when Ryan realised she had lost Wolf for ever as she had then thouht. My one disapointment was that Dillon and Ryan didn't have a lot of time together. Please write another book with these characters in it again. I want to carry on reading about them forever. Keep writing books like A LOVE BEYOND TIME. I will keep looking our for more of your books. Yours Jackie Coffman.
5,Oregon handheld weather forecaster...,"While on a recent camping trip the Oregon Weather Forecaster was right on target when it came it informing me about the possibility of rain, the forecaster allowed us plenty of time to put up our rain fly over the eating/cooking area. I shall take It will be with me on all my outdoor excursions!"
4,Nice Product,"I use my Oregon Forecaster indoors. I have found the temperature to be accurate. I would say two things can be improved.1/ Belt clip- its good to put and display on a desk, but it's not a good belt-clip. I wouldn't even call it a belt-clip.2/ The display can be improved to make it easier to read during the daytime. Maybe a brighter background display.Also, I'd rather it take AA or AAA size batteries. Even if it means it'll increase the size of it.I am still satisfied with the purpose I use it for, displaying temperature in my room. When I want to take it with me outdoors, I put a strap on it. (it has a little slot on the top corner for that)"
4,Nice little gadget,"This is a nice little gadget to have, but there is one problem with it, and that is the belt clip/stand.It is a straight, smooth piece of plastic that can easily slide off a person's belt if they are not careful."
1,Useless device,"This product is useless as a weather forecaster. Its weather forecast is always wrong compared to actual weather. For instant, right now it shows rain when it's sunny and it suppose to be sunny entire week.In my opinion, don't waste your money on this unit get something else."
4,Another C?CG based goodie.,"It's got heart. Architypal characters, but over-all well put together. And it inspires emotional response. A fun read (especially if you'd rather not touch your cards for a while.)"
1,upset,"I waited almost a month to get the ring, then when I got it, the stones are very tiny, the ring is odd shaped, & is kind of cheap looking."
5,**********DON'T BUY THIS BOOK USED****GET NEW!*******,"The quality & care of someone that's previously bought the book & is now reselling it, can't be gauranteed. I'm asking that you buy my books new, fresh from my publisher--Booksurge, if you want it in good condition....if you've received a damaged book,please return it for a refund********************Thank you! Sharon Bennett."
3,Description,"They were fighting for fame, fortune and loveHired as a publicist for the Duval salon, Alix Smith was caught up in the rivalry between aging couturier Henri Duval and his son, Paul, a brilliant new designer.Alix was strangely disturbed when the father-son rivalry extended beyond business to the courting of a beautiful actress. Then she realized she had fallen in love with Paul herself.The situation spelled trouble for everyone. And when events reached their terrifying climax, Alix knew that she would have to risk her life for the sake of her love."
3,Great for the price,"It was constucted of a soft fabric & fit well, considering my hips. Better quality than some stores. :o)"
2,Another Disappointment,"What is going on with the Archive series? This marks the third release I have purchased with much less than expected results. For historical purposes alone, it is worth owning. This tour of Utopia did not make it to the West Coast (we saw Todd do a solo show instead). Alot of material from Deface The Music is present here. The performances overall seem above average. BUT, the recording quality is horrendous! What are these people thinking? I am becoming very disenchanted at how the quality of these releases has headed downhill FAST! I am a fan of 26 yrs. But I can't even listen to this. It is really that poor. What a shame!"
3,Love Everything Todd,"But the recording is just OK. A must have for a Todd fan, but it sounds a bit misty and i only have this to be a completist."
4,Keeps the viewer interested,I liked this picure overall. The tension of the situation had me rooting for the team to make it to the end of their challenge. I certainly couldn't guess who the extra person was. I do think I might have enjoyed a couple of female characters to even out the boys club but oh well.
3,Gotta be good with your Vise Grips!,"It's an okay stamped metal product if you don't mind fussing with it. The price is right. Make sure you push the clips in evenly, after you've set the barb ALL THE WAY IN TO THE HOSE END! Make your cut in the hose REALLY straight!"
2,falsely labeled product,"Caveat emptor! This sheer masterwork has been severely abridged in this printing. I have the 1963 revision of the 1950 first version. Missing from this Kessinger copy are the first two of four books in what is a single volume. Of the complete 1,100 page edition, 540 pages of the printing are absent."
5,Great product,I installed this on a 2006 4runner and it really looks and sounds great. The instructions were clear and concise.
1,old info,This book is completely oudated and every lead that I thought I could use was completely useless. Apparently there is a new edition but it appears that this older edition has been outdated for years. Don't buy this book.
4,The flashbacks stick with you,"This novel was short and yet very effective. By taking a look at Amanda's life during a week of soul searching, we learn about her whole life and the incidents that shaped her. Stahl's use of the flashback is tremendous! Those parts of the book sing ina melancholy way. I agree with another reviewer about liking Amanda's father- wouldn't his story be an even better book?? Anyway, this is very well-written and as honest a treatment of schizophrenia as you're likely to find in a mainstream novel. If you like this, House Under Snow by Bialosky would also be your cup of tea."
3,A little of this but too much of that,"Try as I did (really!) to like and care about the protagonist Amanda, I couldn't (I liked her father more...and she was kind of mean to him). She did whine alot as another reviewer said and I really wasn't all that shocked by her husband's meandering. Much of this book seemed contrived and simplistic and required me to suspend disbelief one time too many (I'd get specific but I don't want to spoil it for those who want to read it). Yes, we all step out of character every now and then but Amanda didn't stop doing it during her stay at the beach...and then we were robbed of reveling in her newfound sense of fun and adventure with her because of her immediate and constant remorse and confusion (i.e. more whining). And her use of the word ""gig"" almost made me put the book away.I wanted deliciousness and wound up with mediocrity!"
2,OK,"This product was okay, but not as interesting as I had hoped. After a short time exploring the product, my children pretty much abandoned it. It was not interesting to them, was not interactive enough and - I think - resembled boring school lessons to them."
1,Don't bother,"If there were a way to give this negative stars I would.If you are looking for an electronic babysitter with some educational value, this is the software for you. However, the interface is not intuitive; the voice-overs sound forced; the program is twitchy if you happen to ""leave"" the window during a demonstration or practice.They advertise 3 or more program levels per subject. I have yet to find anything of the sort. The printable worksheets are only useful if you have a printer immediately handy. They do not appear on the screen ever that I have seen. They can _*only*_ be printed out.It's rigid, restrictive and unforgiving."
2,discontinued,"i'm afraid i can't review this product, even though i had ordered it...... i found out (a week later) that this had been discontinued, and was no longer available. i don't understand why it was even shown for purchase! the other cartridges i have ordered previously worked great, just as expected. thanks anyways."
2,Audience on ice,Cloyingly produced prog-pop cleanly delivers hooks in a typically non-moving manner.
5,Helpful section,"This alone isn't enough, but the rest of the Standard Marketing Procedures for All Dentists that Franklin and Burgett produced is excellent. Having seen it all, this section makes a lot of sense."
1,Disappointing for the money paid,"Dental Business Strategies and Setting Up for Business Success- a three-ring binder publication - left me feeling hungry for marketing tips. The book consists of three chapters taken from Standard Marketing Procedures for All Dentists which is a larger, more expensive publication. The three chapter product cannot stand alone because for example the text refers to information to be discussed in Chapter Five but the book has only three chapters. The book does have good charts for tracking marketing methods and also helpful job description forms for the office staff with a marketing flavor. These come on a disk so that the charts and forms can be tailored to the individual dental practice."
5,a balanced inspirational music with creativity and spiritual touch,"This is for me one of his best creations of stephan micus. It is divides by 3 parts, the first is like the light, with a guitar composition of easy construction but amazing fluid development. The second part is dominated by the introduction of the large tubular Nin um nin, the sound breakes the peaceful first part, the taste is asw tibetan budisth ceremony, here the tension of the record start. The thirth part is obscure like the subconcient mind. confuse. If you have been in an indian ceremony with a potent drug, the state of platau in wich you are alone with your soul, this is the feeling of the music in the finale.Too deep cd, this is not only spiritual musi, is a real music-psicology travel"
5,Excellent True Crime,"This is a well-written (although with a little British slant to it) non-fiction about the murder of Jim Grund, by his wife Susan Grund. The book goes into as much detail as possible, although as usual I wish that there were more about Susan's childhood - was she really molested by her father? Was she abused in other ways? Probably. I don't see HOW Susan managed to get away with what she did to her defenseless step-son - or how the father of that child can live with himself. Susan obviously could live with her herself quite well, going on to marry for money - and commit murder for money. She's ruined so many lives, and has no remorse."
4,arch supports for shoes,These arch supports help reduce pain from plantar fasciitis. I have used them in all my shoes for several years.They are easy to move to different shoes or you can tape them in so they don't slide forward.
3,Arch support,"These were as I expected but not as I had hopped. Good quality and should last a long time, but I need something with just arch support and nothing in the heal. Still looking :-("
2,This Game Sucks!!!!!!!!,I bought this game and it doesnt come with any instruction booklet and they expect you to try to figue it out. I have tried for hours and it makes no since. It looks like it has potential to be a fun game in the store...but no booklet gets you nowhere.I wish I could take it back!!!!!
1,I Would Give It No Stars (If I Could),"This was the hardest game that I have ever tried to play. (And I have played many simulated games) The number one problem is the fact that there is no instruction manual. What's up with that? It took me a long time just to figure out how to exit the game! I have tried and tried, and I just cannot figure out this game - and the tutorial is no help. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, AND FOR HEAVENS SAKES, DO NOT BUY THE EXPANSION!! This game is a total rip-off, and waste of [money]!!"
2,Humor doesn't cut it!,"Why is it called Fast Food Tycoon when all I can make is pizza? Hmmm... Anyway on with the review!Positives+ humorous, cartoony graphics make the game visually stimulating+ colorful and interactive menus help streamline choicesNegatives- abyssmal soundtrack and sound effects- help menus and context slow and annoying- game concepts are fuzzy and nigh impossible to master- even on easy modes the computer knows all the tricks- terrible and uninformative tutorialsOverall... Fast Food Tycoon is a good idea with neat visuals but the implementation of the game is amateurish. It might be worth a few bucks but there are better tycoon games out there.... Performance is fine - as long as your PC matches the recommended configuration you'll be good to go. Disable any virus software or other background services if you have problems."
3,How to Exit,"It isn't that hard to exit all of you that aren't too bright. There are two icons that are on the main screen once you are playing the game. One of them is used for saving, and the other is for settings. Just click on the settings icon and then it will give you choices on how to exit. It has a windows icon that will bring you to windows, or a rocket/missile type thing that brings you out of the playing part of the game. I hope that now all of you slow people will learn how to do this."
1,Waste of Money,"This game is really boring, maybe someone under five may have fun with it but really it was not worth the money. I played it once and tossed it out. I might as well flushed my money down the can."
1,Stupid,THis game is the stupidest game I have ever played!! It is called FAST FOOD I don't consider pizza fast food!! It is so boring!! I would give this game no stars if it was possible. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!
4,Found the Icons--Glossary,"Demographics in the back, then click on the bottom icon, then click on the cloud to the right. Took me 2 weeks to find it, but now at least I understand. This makes the game make more sense, but I wish they would write something like ""GLOSSARY"" below the cloud."
3,Now how do u build a 1st Class Resturant w/ 1 gourmet star??,"From all of the reviews that I read, I totally thought that I would have something different to say but I don't. I purchased Fast Food Tycoon 2, which is fairly fun because you get to put rats and stink bombs in the competing resturants. However after you get so far it like ok....how do you do whatever the goal is. I have been playing this game off and on for about three months and once I get to the third level, I figure out how to do all of the levels goals but one and it hard because there is no manual to part 2 either so you're like playing until something different happens. The game is very amusing if you like being able to blow up places and threaten money out the weaker AI player but the game should only be played if you got a lot of time on your hands because it takes a lot of figuring out."
4,B+,"A fun challenging game that will most likely fulfil your sim-business needs. When you first start out, you will be without a manual, however there are preset in game scenarios that help you to get adjusted to the basic workings of the game and to help you move around and get accostomed to the gameplay. For a tycoon game, it was quite exceptional, and surprisingly entertaining, even if you ae not a fan of sim and tycoon games, you may still want to check this one out."
2,Can't figure this game out,"The idea is great, the graphics are good (even if the icons are a little confusing) and I even figured out how to run the tutorial, set up a restaurant, design a menu, get financing, hire workers AND EXIT the game. What I can't do is make people come in and eat Pizza! I also can't seem to speed up the clock (it's a little boring watching the restaurant when it's closed at night)This game could probably be great with a little instruction beyond the tutorial. I've looked for tips, cheats, web ring etc., and nothing exists. I only gave this game 2 stars because I have HOPE that someday I will figure it out."
2,Can't find the exit!,"This game is very confusing, but I yhink that it has a great plot. The only thing that made me give it two stars is that I just can't find that exit icon. If you know where it is please write another review that tell me that!"
2,I thought it was like Sim Town & Sim City,I to was very disappointed in this game. The cover of the box gives you the idea like you'll be creating the towns and resturants. The graphics are excellent. They had a great idea with this game. Just didn't follow thru. I also wished they had at least included a manual with the game. I bought mine a few days ago and now wished I hadn't. I'll be more careful next time.
2,Great Idea - poor execution,"The idea of creating and managing your own fast food chain, and then watching it function from a bird's eye view is a great one. Unfortunately, Activision failed at recreating this idea to your PC with Fast Food Tycoon. The main reason the game is a failure is because of it's confusing gameplay. It helps to use the tutorial but even after that you'll find yourself wondering, ""How did I get to that certain screen that let me do that certain function."" Watching your pizza(only type of food)place function is pretty cheasy also. There are very few animations and there's not many ways to edit the looks of the place either. If your looking for a solid simulaion game that will keep you entertained for hours your better off with Theme Hospital, Roller Coaster Tycoon, or one of the sim-cities. Do your cholesterol a favor and pass this Fast Food."
4,Make Your Own Pizza while Running your very own Resturant,"I brought Fast Food Tycoon a few years back because I enjoy playing the demo I got online. It is one of my favorite classic game like Theme Hospital.Pros:love the graphic, you get to do other things besides make pizzas like sell weapons,sabotage your competitors, and make your own style of pizzaCons: wish you can serve more than just pizza, and hard to understand how to play at the beginning since it doesn't come with a manual. Overall enjoyed it very much, and plan on gettting Fast Food Tycoon 2"
1,very dissapointing!!,"When you first see the box of this game, you think oh i must have one of them. Well the game is set up terrible, along with it has no instructions with is. I would strongly advise you to not buy this game.DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!"
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this game like I have bought most sim games. This one could be alot of fun if you knew what you were doing. but unfortunatly, no instruction booklet comes with it. It does have a tutorial, but its kinda hard to follow, and its not there when you go to do it on your own. I have given this game about ten hours now and still have gone bust with each time. I have yet to win a scenario. If you dont automate the help, you cant figure out how to space them so they dont all show up at once and go home at once leaving an empty restaurant with hungry customers. You can automate everything, but what fun is that? As mentioned in another review, if you knew what your customer was thinking it would be nice so you can try to change it, but there is no way to tell. My advice is to [ignore] any game that doesnt come with an instruction manual."
3,Facts might be correct but POORLY written/edited,"This book might possibly be good; however, I could only make it through the 1st chapter because the grammar and typos are so numerous. I had to reread almost every sentence because the writing is so indecipherable. Where was this person's editor? Did this person get a proofreader? If I had known about all the typos and grammatical mistakes I would never have wasted my money. If you can overlook poor grammar and typos this will probably be worth reading."
5,What a book !!,"The painful truth of the Autsim health crisis is revealed in this book. The documentation is so clear that there is no doubt what actually happened.I agree with everything this book states. In fact, it cannot be argued about. The supplied documentation and commentary is straight forward and very concise. I wish this book was written about 12 years ago. I think alot of the children could have been saved. The author gets an A+...... A job well done !"
4,An informed eye opener,A good book that is filled with straight forward facts abouttoday's vaccine injured children.....A national tragedy !!
1,Stay Away,"I bought this router because of the ""Business Class"" classification and for the Cisco name. I've always had good luck with their routhers in the past. This router is a piece of junk. I got it and it dropped my internet connection several times a day. We did the firmware upgrade and finally sent it back to Cisco for a replacement...guess what, the new one did the same thing. Stay away from this router."
3,Mixed,"Well setting this up took all of 2 minutes, the menus were exactly what you'd expect, same old Linksys setup, but with a ton more options.Everything went smoothly, speed was great, and no issues.Then I went to update the firmware (3 minutes after setting it up) as I have with my other Linksys routers many times. The browser got redirected to a page not found right after the upgrade started and would do the same every time. I rebooted the router to try again, and it no longer turns on.So if you get it, either try to upgrade the firmware right away so you can return it if it dies, or don't touch the firmware.Starting to lose faith in Linksys."
2,"Router okay, VPN has caveats","We have a LinkSys RVS4000 at our ofc/lab. The router and firewall functions seem to be acceptable, though i am not sure if our sys admin ever figured out how to isolate two internal networks from each other. The VPN function requires software on the remote machine.I feel there are two isses with this product:1) For the VPN, Linksys provides Quick VPN, or you can buy (as in, pay for) another product such as TheGreenBow.In my opion, QuickVPN is garbage; a less than amateur kluge that requires other kluges in your system to be able to use it.TheGreenBow seems to work, but their support takes a day to respond, and, it is an expensive alternative to something that is supposed to be included with the product.2) Linksys support left me frustrated.They require that you have the serial number for your router unit. If you are away from the office and cannot get the serial number, you are out of luck. It does not appear in the admin login for our unit."
2,poor vpn support,"vpn doesn't work with win7x64 ultimate edition. called cisco to confirm.with years of building networks i was hoping this more of cisco like device. rather i found it to be a crap linksys like device with a cisco logo. i'm much happier after switching over to a netgate, [...]"
1,linksys rsv4000 lockup,"We have had this unit for over a year, and it routinely locks up. It has been very frustrating, especially since it was intended for remote access. Note, remote. Hard to reboot a system when you are remote. We will have to scrap this one and get TP-Link.There are quite a few reviews about lockup. I am one of them."
2,Do not buy a RVS4000 as it has problems,"**UPDATE**This router is still junk. But the new firmware does do FTP now, so I wanted to update my review from 1 star to 2 stars. The router is still very slow compared to the ActionTec router I was using. And, please, don't get me started about the Linksys tech support.**ORIGINAL**This router does not do FTP through the router even though the manual says it should. The performance for HTTP is very slow. Everything else is functional, though."
2,Y4K junk heap! firmware download of 1.1.14 registered as 1.1.11! how stupid is that?!,"In addition to said title of this message, you can't even access the configuration with the ""admin"" user/passcode. If you use utilities to update firmware, the onsite firmware is acutally listed as 1.1.14 and DOWNDates mine from it's inital 1.1.12 to 1.1.11! how droll! If you have an earthlink acount, your in for a bigger mess as they're ""spaeecial!"" meaning you must both bridge your modem(via instructions if your lucky to get a tech that's cohearent, I did. once.) The router has it's own problems(thus I don't reveiw my modem) the modem problem is solved! And yet mister router here, still won't config once you bridge it. PPOE support is awful! avoid in not only Vista but also XP!!! Not OS fault, the router's lameness and mal firmware!"
1,Dissapointing,"I purchased this router to replace my 100mbps linksys router. I connected it up, and my browser was much slower than with the older router, and many web sites timed out. I was unable to get this resolved, and I returned the router for a refund."
4,Multifunctioned Gem with QoS and Jumbo Frame Support!,"I am baffled by the other reviewer’s comments – the Linksys RVS4000 router is an advanced, integrated router, a firewall and a 4-port full duplex gigabit switch that will satisfy most home offices and home networks. It is economical as it replaces two devices the router and switch, and offers gigabit speed. Nothing else on the market will do this.The RVS4000 is a gem that supports QoS allows parents to regulate their children’s internet and network access. Heck, the thing even supports jumbo frames unlike a lot of expensive managed 10/100/1000 managed switches; although the MaxFrame feature default is set to 1518 (disabled), and must be manually set to 9600 to get the benefit.Otherwise, the RVS4000 worked great for me."
2,Excellent - if you don't use VPN tunnels,"I bought this router/firewall about ten months ago to replace an older SMC Barricade that was becoming unreliable. For the most part I have been pleased with it, it has a decent firewall/IDS, VLAN routing, good DHCP configurability and purports to have VPN support. Unfortunately, I have found that with a VPN tunnel configured, there is a memory leak in the firmware vpn code that causes the router to reboot every 24 hours. This could be tolerable for me if I could time the reboot (or schedule one) but that is not supported and it only comes back from the reboot 80% of the time. After disabling the VPN tunnel it works fine. My hope is that they will get around to fixing it in a newer firmware version but I have stayed current and found the update frequency to be very slow. So, if you don't need the VPN tunnel this is a fine (if pricey) unit. If you need a reliable VPN tunnel product, try something else at this point."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"I bought this mainly for it's Gigabit switch, almost all current routers are wireless these days. It was easy to install and configure. No problems."
5,Great Router,Highly recommend this router. It is easy to configure but how some extra features that make it worth the money. Very solid.
2,No VPN,"From the Linksys Quick VPN Client 1.2.5 release notes (current version), ""QuickVPN Client v1.2.5 has an interop issue with RVS4000 firmware v1.1.09 and v1.1.11 (beta)."".From what I can tell, this router simply doesn't provide VPN capabilities as advertised. The current firmware and current VPN client are incompatible and have been for several months. It's well documented on the forums and linksys tech support (from my experience) cannot help. If you can some how get your hands on a 1.0.x version of the firmware you might be OK, but linksys won't provide it."
1,Garbage,"Do not buy this product. Search the web for 'rvs4000 ftp'. You will see that you cannot ftp through this router. Worse yet, Linksys doesn't care. They have made no effort to fix it and don't even respond to customers about the issue."
1,"CRASHES every 2 ~ 3 hours, it wont reset by itself","Don't waste your money and time.The router crashes every 2 or 3 hours and you need to reset it to get it to work again. It can not reset itself after the crash, you need to do it manually by unpluging & pluging the power.I tried to upload the latest firmware, but the file downloaded from cisco's website did not work either.It gave an error message indicating that ""the firmware was not a proper firmware""I tried to call Cisco for further support, they asked me to create a Cisco account first so that they could assist me over the phone.If you dont have a Cisco account , they will not help you. I don't want to waste my time to deal with this junk.I am returning it back, and I will buy another brand router."
2,Incompatible behind business class gateway,"Unlike the marvelous older Linksys BEFVP41 VPN router, the RVS4000 cannot be configured behind another gateway (modem/router) device provided by your ISP. The older router did not require a local WAN value to create VPN tunnels. This newer router does and it will default diminished to the internal LAN address from the gateway. I was surprised and very disappointed that the newer model lacked the flexibility of the older one. Like other reviewers I noticed greatly reduced speed over the WAN and returned the two units I purchased after several days of testing."
1,Locks up crap... look at ALL the 1 stars,"I have this RVS4000, and its CRAP!Generally reset this router 1ce/week and it did the trick, except when it doesn't work... then its a headache and nightmare.There is a good reason why this has been end of life by Cisco I suspect... but even supporting the a later firmware v1.3 version only works with a red light condition (another type of lockup) as discussed in their utility read me note."
1,"Even with firmware 1.0.15 (10/05/2006), device needs reset constantly","I bought this despite the negative feedback 'cause I have always had a good experience with Linksys hardware. Now I'm returning it. The device requires a full reset regularly, sometimes several times a day. Not only is Internet activity interrupted, but the admin/management page is inaccessible."
4,Great VPN & VLAN support,"Got this to firewall an Internet service and its been working great! The Built-in IPS (Intruder Prevention System) seems to catch a lot of attacks, so that part is good. Setting up VLANs (Virtual LANs) is a snap and seems to work great. The IPSec VPN really only works right with the Linksys QuickVPN software, but its easy to install and if you follow the directions, works great the first time out. This box is overkill for just a home network, but for us SOHO users with data that we need to access while mobile, its a champ! Now if it only have VIP (Virtual IP) so I could set up some Highly-Available servers.... Documentation is rather sparse in my opinion, so its not a good choice for a net n00by to set up."
2,Router,"This cisco/Linksys router is overly complex in it's user interface. It does allow complete freedom for port-forwarding which is good. The VPN is almost impossible to set-up. The automatic DHCP does not seem to work well with other peoples gear (netgear and Dlink). Generally the router runs warm and in my case became intermittant failure after only one year in operation. I've owned several linksys/cisco routers over the years and this is the last one own. From now on, I've moved to netgear. Much easier set-up, more user friendly and better performance."
1,VPN doesn't work,"The entire reason I bought this router is for VPN capability and it doesn't work. The client is proprietary, from Linksys, and at random intervals (less than every few minutes tho) it errors with ""Gateway not responding."" It's just not functional. I've swapped it out twice (Linksys thought it was a hardware problem) and ALL of the units I've gotten have the same problem. Good luck with this one."
5,Pluto Rock !!!!!!,"This is an excellent album from a much underrated early 70`s band.Formed by Paul Gardner,formerly with,amoungst others,Dry Ice and Alan Warner from The Foundations.The album was originally released in 1971 on the Dawn label and has since the latter half of the 90`s become a much sought after item in the underground/progressive sector of the market.Prompting evocative memories of many other rock bands of the era,notably Bad Co. Black Sabb. and Zepp. this stuff still sounds well tasty across the years !!"
5,"Fast, Manuverable and bombproof at a bargain price","I have been IKing for 15 plus years, started with tahitis, tried river xs and Stearns self bailers but knew how good the aire $1000 plus kayaks were in comparision. This boat is nearly identical to the older aire Caracal IK, it is half the price of the US made Aire boats and just a little more from than the River X or Stearns Self bailer. It outperforms either, I have run it on Class III water with great results, have taken many first timers down class I and II white water, this boat is rugged and forgiving, handles well and the self bailing is extremely efficient which is important when you are crashing river waves and holes! A Great buy! I own two of the doubles and six singles and routinely take kids from 6-60 down rivers with these boats."
1,Don't waste your money,"Plain and simple it sucks. I got it after reading reviews that were misleading. They said the movie was comedians shutting down hecklers. While it had SOME of that. A majority of the movie was Jamie Kennedy crying and whining about why nobody likes him and how he always gets bad reviews. Should have been called ""My crybaby diary"" If Jamie was out to make himself look good and get better reviews this DVD sure as he** wont do it. If you wanna see hecklers get shut down search you tube, Don't buy this piece of junk."
3,What will Jaime say when he reads this?,"I really liked this at first. The film made me realize that comedians are people who put themselves out there with their creative work. Being criticized by drunks trying to get attention is a form of bullying and it was refreshing to see so many artists talk about it. There are some great interviews with some of my favorites: David Cross and Patton Oswalt, for example. However, I started to realize this documentary was centered around Kennedy being upset for the mostly terrible reviews he was getting for his movies. Many of the reviews were done by non-critics and Kennedy spends time trying to figure out why they said they things they did. Personally, I'm not a fan of his stand up but I do think the message of the documentary is important and timely."
3,An interesting look at hecklers,"In some ways it must serve as a cathartic expression for Jamie Kennedy, a comedian that has been the butt of many jokes and critiques. The film centers on Kennedy confronting many of his critics - who generally remain anonymous and crave that power that comes with anonymity. The film serves to remind us to be more gentle towards society in general. All in all it is an interesting look at hecklers from the perspectives of comics, and a reminder that those people that we have put upon pedestals are, in fact, human. My one critique is the sound editing - it would have been better if the volume was universal throughout all of the interviews/comments/etc."
1,The 5 star reviews,Have got to be friends of Jaime's/stupid groupies etc. Someone said they laughed out loud 20 times...I can't think of one time I even remotely laughed...smiled maybe..I don't even remember anything about it except all he did was whine and cry about how critics don't like him and how they suck and ruin his image. Critics liked the movie The Godfather? Why? Because it was good. Critics didn't like anything with J-Lo in it..or Jaime Kennedy.....its not the critics that suck...its a big nosed popcorn fart named Jaime Kennedy that sucks. And so does this movie....
1,Way to go Jamie,"Instead of making a film that people would care about, and maybe even respect, you made this lame ode to your hurt feelings.Don't waste your time friends. There is only about twenty minutes of actual comedian vs. heckler interaction/analysis. It very quickly changes gears and becomes a film about comic's feelings. Jamie Kennedy made a movie about how critics hurt his feelings. It's more than just a little pathetic. Now instead of a no talent, he is a no talent crybaby. Good work Jamie. See you in Mask III."
3,Get Off the Stage,Jamie Kennedy take a look at why people heckle comedians through anecdotes and videos of hecklers in action. To me it was mildly amusing but really poorly produced.
1,"lack of talent, no lack of complaining","The movie starts strong, and when it stays on topic it's actually pretty good. Unfortunately the film quickly moves from hecklers to Jammie Kennedy complaining about then confronting critics. Kennedy's confrontation consist of telling people ""the difference between you and me is I took a limo to the show"" and asking ""how much money do you make?"". Maybe Kennedy could put his acquired wealth toward find a good therapist, or at least enriching his life to the point where he judges himself and other by a deep standard then income."
1,Tale of two movies in one.,First part of the movie lasts for 30 mins. Mainly about how seasoned comics deal with hecklers on stage. This is the best part of the movie. Would have given the whole movie 4 stars if all 85min. was the first part. The second part was just grown adults whining about people writing about them. Good thing I only paid 50 cents for this.
3,Not fantastic not horrible,"I watched this documentary over the weekend and it was just ok. It starts out being pretty good. It shows people heckling comedians and how the comedians react and then interviews them on their view point on hecklers. This part of the movie was really good and shows you how big of idiots people can be.Then it takes a turn for the worse. The rest of the movie is Jamie Kennedy confronting ""critics"" and demanding to know why they did not like what ever he did, be it stand up or a movie. I understand Mr. Kennedy's feelings that sometimes these critics are not critiquing his film or work but him personally but he really must understand that that is what comes with the career he choose.I don't feel it was a complete waste of my hour and a half but I don't think I would watch this again."
5,"Great, Insightful Documentary","I saw an advanced screening of this movie in Los Angeles earlier this year and was blown away by the film. Jamie Kennedy and film maker Michael Addis' provide interesting insight into the culture of hecklers and critics in general. Funny and provocative it is along the lines of ""The Aristocrats"" and ranks as one of the best documentaries about the comedy world. If you are a fan of Jamie Kennedy or just a fan of comedy, you will love this documentary. I also found an online contest for the movie that has a grand prize of an all expense paid trip to Hollywood and to hang out on Jamie Kennedy's new television series ""Ghost Whisperer"". Check it out here: http://www.jamiekennedyworld.com/the-heckler-video-submission-contest/"
3,please stop bashing all christians kennedy,kennedy is a talented guy but i pray he stops making fun of all christians and tones down the profanity.
5,This is required viewing for any performer.,"I really think that Jamie hit the nail on the head with this one. This movie is inspiring to any performer at all. Even anyone in the public eye needs to see this. Maybe critics who see this might just take a little edge off of their mean spirited remarks now? I hope so. performer's don't need to be lied to, we need truth, but certainly not mean truth. Jamie has done a great job on this film, I can highly suggest that you buy it, watch it, as it was really worth the time, and then some. The number of performers in this is amazing too. It was presented very well, edited very well, and took us on a great ride through the performer's world of emotions.Jamie, you did real good. Be proud."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Both entertaining and thought provoking; funny and sad; pleasant and unpleasant; enlightening and obvious; emotional and intellectual: all the elements of a great documentary.It is about criticism and unintended cruelity and intentional cruelity in the relationship between Hollywood and movie critics but it is much more. Its message speaks to all, on many levels, about the golden rule, and our social interactions but Heckler is in no way heavy handed or preachy. Honestly I was happy for Mr.Kennedy because he created such a successful film, and of course, i do not know him at all. Jamie Kennedy, cast and crew- wonderful work!!!!!! More, please?"
4,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED,"I found this documentary quite well made and entertaining, and a lot more thought provoking than I expected. The interviewees include everyone from the Fonz to Princess Leia to Doctor Drew to Andrew Dice Clay to Bill Maher to Andy Kindler to Craig Feguson. And all of the above have interesting opinions on the subject of hecklers.It was a bit of a stretch comparing film criticism to heckling, and the only way Kennedy could make the point work was by ignoring film criticism that celebrates good filmmaking. There's still plenty of that around, and presumably Kennedy is well aware of this, as he's been associated with a number of films that have gotten good reviews. Also, his point about critics giving snider reviews than necessary is a valid one, but it's nothing new. Bosley Crowther and Paul Kael were capable of eviscerating crap way back when."
3,woeful drums,"This DVD is from the video tape ""Live In Concert"" released in 1998 but recorded in 1987. It's unfortunate, with Marc in his prime, that this sounds poor. The band seems to be missing a bass player, or the bass is off, and the drums sound like popcorn. The drums sound so thin it becomes distracting, but Marc is still brimming with charm as he sings beautifully. The extra footage may be rare but Marc's mic is too loud, thus distorting it so much making it practically unlistenable.Overall though, if you're a fan then this is still worth having.There is a much better live video of Marc called ""Twelve Years of Tears"" at London's Royal Albert Hall 1992, which from what I know is not on DVD yet."
1,not so impressed,"I bought this a few months ago to have a reference around, but just looked at it while trying to locate an artery in the head. According to this text, we have two vagus nerves, and one of them looks suspiciously like an artery. So I started looking through the rest of the book, and what a mess. It does have many great illustrations. But another reviewer mentioned using it for patient teaching, and I don't think it's accurate enough for that. This one's getting traded in."
2,"Nice drawings, awful text","This book has excellent drawings which seem to be very precise and anatomically correct, are useful to study. Unfortunately, many of the labels of the drawings are misspelled, pointing to the wrong places or simply wrong. The text overall is full of errors which mainly seem to be the result of mistranslations and lack of editing/proofreading."
3,Great illustrations not much written info.,"For the money, I have yet to find a better book of anatomy illustrations. There is very little written education material so should be purchased mainly for the illustrations alone. This book is great for those who are just curious about anatomy as well as for someone in the health care field. It's particularly good for patient education."
4,Cortelco Single Line Wall Phone,"I have had four other wall phones hanging in the garage in the 20 years we've lived here. The ones with caller ID and other fancy electronics don't seem to survive the temperature swings. This is an old style touch-tone phone with an adjustable ringer but not much else in the way of frills. The perfect solution.My only problem was that it is designed to clip onto a wall plate that includes a telephone 4-pin socket. The back of the phone I received had the two ""keyhole"" openings for the studs on such a wall plate and a 4-pin telephone jack that plugs into the wall plate's socket. My wall plate has a telephone 4-pin socket only, and it's location is in an inconvenient location to just replace the plate. I have two screws in the wall where I want the phone to hang. It works great now, but I had to add my own wiring to make it all work the way I wanted it to."
2,Ring is not loud enougth,Phone was easy to install and fit the wall plate ok. The ring of the phone is not loud enought
2,Ringer not loud enough,"Solid old fashioned phone - just what we were looking for, but the ringer isn't loud enough. We needed simple, rock solid, old fashioned wall phones for a business but the ringer needed to be loud enough for a business too. Otherwise a solid phone with good handset volume."
5,very nice,"The service was very fast, and the phone has a volume control. was very satisfied with this phone."
1,didnt work,"received this item yesterday - trust me it is a quality items i was expecting a junky piece of plastic but it is just as you would remember from back in the day. i was very happy to get it but it did not work properly. people couldn't hear me so i am trying to exchange it today - i hope im not dissapointed in its replacement. i will let you all know when i get the new one. 4/20/11 Well im back - i received my replacement phone and unfortunately, it does not work. This one seems as im talking in a tunnel and the people i call say i sound like im far away. it is a shame, i love the phone. i will have to find another brand / provider to get what i need."
3,"Rating Cortelco, Not the Phone","Very pleased with the phone itself. However, the photo shows a white phone. The description said the color is ivory. I learned too late that in Cortelco-talk, ivory means beige. If something is beige, then say it's beige. I am not happy."
4,Cellar of Horror,"Book opens quickly and gets you into the story. This is not fiction, a story of horror and tragedy. Not for the faint hearted. The background information is well researched. Only issue is no update on the final chapter but you can go online for the update."
4,Kept My Attention,"Good book, well written, kept me reading it. It's pretty shocking what people can get away with for so long before being found out."
3,Horrifying Story + Bad Writing Style = It's worth reading once,"- This story is more terrifying and stranger than most of the horror movies I've ever seen. Garry Hednik held 5 young women captive as sex slaves for months. He tortured them and killed two of them. He dismembered one of the corpses. He founded the United Church of Ministers of God and became its bishop. He made some money on stocks too!- The writing style is very annoying and anti-climax. The author keeps jumping around from one year to another. For example, chapter one started on November 26, 1986. Then, chapter 3 started on November 29, 1961. Then, chapter 4 started on November 27, 1986. Consequently, the story is choppy, not suspenseful, and anti-climax. What a shame! It could have been a great book.In short, it's worth reading once."
3,Glad I paid half price,"The author's way of writing tends to get boring at times, especially when he's writing about Gary's past with mental illness. The story takes numerous jumps in time, but there's a timeline in the back that helps the reader keep the story in order. I found the first 100 pages to be very compelling, but after that, the story lost its appeal and dragged a bit. The court process has more pages than the crime itself. To me, that made it boring in the end. I skimmed portions of the last 150 pages because it was slow paced and repeated what was already told. Thankfully, it was less than 300 pages, but I still think the crime should have had more pages than the court process."
3,It's...OK!,"This story about Heidnik was ok. It jumped back and forth between his childhood and current events which seemed to throw me off at first. Once chapter you were reading about his childhood then the next chapter was him picking up a prostitute. I can say I lived in Philadelphia, not too far from Gary wen this took place. Just from the news and a quick google search gives me more knowledge than this book. I am almost done the book and can honestly say this book has been the longest pick up and put down book that I ever came across. It's a shame, Gary was one sick dude and his story would really blow your minds, if it was written a different way."
3,This guy should have been locked in a basement......,"I love true crime and this was an interesting story but to me the real message was that this guy should never have been out in the normal population in the first place. It ended up being more a commentary on the problems associated with housing and treating the severely disturbed and mentally ill people in our society. The author reported the story of Gary but it jumped around a lot and did much repeating of information and details. Not the best true crime novel, but it did tell the story of this lunatic."
4,"Horrible crime, good book","Mr. Englade did a good job staying with the story, by just telling the story. You get an idea of what he (the author) thinks but that's it. I don't read true crime to learn about the thoughts and feelings of the author, I read them for the facts of the case. Gary Heidnik and the things that he did to those girls were horrible. After learning about what he wrote to a fiancee' while in jail, I do wonder how much of his problems were fake and what was real."
4,pretty good as live albums go....,"This set is more or less RevCo's debut album performed live. It betters the studio recordings in that the performances sound looser, and the mix itself has more bottom end to it. Tagged onto the end of the second disc are a pair of live bonus tracks taken from the b-sides of singles. The highlight is their cover of ""Public Image"", where they manage to taunt the crowd with a few bars of Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin songs before tearing into a savage but surprisingly faithful rendition of PiL's first single. Great fun."
1,"Nice company, bad product","I just got these in the mail the other day, and they looked stunning, so I was excited to try them out. There were two BIG problems though: one, the piece that goes through the earlobe is so big that it's painful, and two, the space between the front and back of the clasp (the part that encases the earlobe) is so small that they were too painful to keep in. Unless you have big holes and very thin earlobes, I'd look elsewhere for earrings like these."
2,Tight,The part that you put through your earlobe was too tight so by the end of day my earlobe was sore.
3,I Hope They Last,"I purchased several pieces from Sabrina Silver and am disappointed in only two -- this being one of them. I love the size, but I'm afraid they will break easily. I had to tighten the clasp, by pushing it together, in order for the earring to remain closed. That made me uneasy. I wore them once (a full day) so far, without any problem, but I sense frequent wearing will result in breakage. I'm disappointed because finding a solid pair of silver hoops is high on my list.Otherwise, the company is great. I haven't had to deal with them directly, but shipment and delivery were very speedy."
3,Good. Bad.,"4 of my aunts own this iron and I absolutely love it! I was super excited to trade my books with amazon and told myself that with the gift card balance I was going to buy one of my own. So I did, and Today I received it. I was totally excited when I got the package! Surprised too because it came in 2 days when I had regular shipping of 3-5days. So, I open the package, and what do I get? A Tom Tom GPS. I was soo extremely disappointed!! Now I have to return the TomTom and wait for that package to get to the company, then wait again for my straightner to arrive. Definitely won't be here until next week. I'm super disappointed with the package mistake. I just want my HAI which I know will be fantastic. I recommend this iron to anyone! Its truly amazing :)"
1,Disappointed,"So my hair dresser has this flat iron and I love hers, so I ordered this one and this was crap. I have had it for 2 month and this is not heating up anymore, does not work at all anymore, I feel maybe it was a knock off. Including it took a month for me to get the flat iron and when I contacted the people, they were no help...I will never buy this again..Money well wasted!!!"
1,Right from the salon!,"Great product. It's was brand new never used. Just like the ones that I used to sell in my salon. Box came in perfect condition and just in time for my trip. My previous one lasted for 5-6 years. I hope this one will too. The seller is great at communicating as well.Thanks!12/22/11This was a great product until this week. The flat iron has already shorted out and doesn't stay on anymore and barely works. I now have to purchase another flat iron. I will get the same brand, but not from this seller. I'm very sad that it only lasted 2 months. I have a case for it and I also a shelf for when I'm at home, so this flat iron doesn't go through anything that would have caused it to short out. As I was doing my hair one more it started making a popping noise & then just stopped working."
3,....but not on Wii,Does anybody has a Wii version of this? This would have been the best Wii game I've ever had if it's on Wii. I have the Reload and I really like it. Wish I have this Top Shot on Wii.
4,"simple easy to listen to, basic arrangements ,good voice!!!!","I Thought the CD was well done, the music is pleasant to listen too,the arrangements are simple and the singer sounds really good!! you need to record some more songs.."
3,This version is okay but the standard version is better,"I just bought the Deluxe version and was disappointed that there is no drawer to hold the cards and that the case is not in the box. The cars are glitzed up with shiny paint but other than that, the game is the same. I prefer the plastic cars in the original game. The game is still just as fun and addictive as ever to play."
5,Love it,This game will keep you entertained for hours! I absolutely love it and gets your mind going. I purchased several additional cards to play more!
3,Rush Hour Deluxe - not Deluxe,"We were thinking that this game was going to be a deluxe version (as the title suggests) of the original. My son paid extra money thinking the box and cars would be metal and upgraded. We now know the box is still cardboard and the cars are still plastic. Should be called ""Different"" but certainly not ""Deluxe""."
5,A Must-Buy Toy,"My son started off with the Jr. version of this toy, and now this Deluxe Edition for 8yrs to adult. My husband and I also love this toy. Not a toy that only your children enjoy but parents too - cause it encourages strategic thinking. A must-have toy you will use over and over again. It is my gift of choice for birthdays."
5,!,My daughter played with friends and then asked to have it to take to college...has great time with it.
4,Treasure for young and old,"Very entertaining, well made, good plot,and would like to purchase if ever available."
1,Who thought of such a STUPID movie???????,"CHEESE ALERT!!! If you like cheese you'd enjoy this movie.This was the ..., cheesiest, actionless movie ever made. If I could give it NO stars, I would....[plot spoiler]...This film was so bloodless that it was ridiculous. Not even the pirates got so much as a bloody lip. ...[plot spoiler]... Nobody in this film was touched. How stupid and BORING can it get??Well, folks, I BEG you never to see this dumb movie. Don't waste an hour or two of your good time. Watch a good movie ... It's for the good of the world."
3,Could have been a classic,"I understand this film was based on a book called Hakon Hakonsen (and that was the movie's original title). I never read the book, so I cannot comment on how good it is or if the film measures up.This film both delights and disappoints. The scenery is beautiful, the music is good, the production values appear to be high, and Stian Smestad is a stunning Nordic beauty. It is a shame he did not appear in more movies.Shipwrecked could have been a classic family film but it is flawed by too much cheesiness in the plot. Apparently, the producers knew they were making a ""kid's movie"" and felt that excused them from making a truly high quality film that all ages could enjoy, and that is a shame. There is a lot of potential here, just unrealized."
5,A Family Favorite,"This outstanding Disney release has become a family favorite. Several interesting plot twists and appealing characters keep young and not so young audience members coming back to view this movie again and again. Devotion to family, loyalty to friends and perseverence in crises involving both natural and manmade dangers are the underlying values so entertainingly conveyed in Shipwrecked. This gem is brilliantly polished with scenic contrasts and details of production. We wore out the VHS version and ordered the DVD--enough copies so that the grandchildren could have Shipwrecked in their parents' video collections at home."
4,Shipwrecked Dvd,"Very cool family movie. Absolutely no offensive material, interesting plot and one evil bad guy!"
5,Great movie for kids,"This is an old Disney movie that was made for tv. It has a foreign cast, but the acting is good. I had video-taped it for my kids a long time ago, but the tape wore out. I was glad to see it available on DVD. When I got it, my boys were excited, even though they are nearly grown now."
4,Shipwrecked,"Dear Amazon:The Disney movie, ""Shipwrecked"" is a very entertaining family film. A good story and the acting was very pleasant................a good family movie with plenty of beautifully shot scenery.I recommend this movie to all who are looking for a nice family entainment without all the sexual and negativeness society nowadays finds as normal for making movies.Mario C.Concord, CA."
4,Stian Smedstad,"I enjoyed the movie because the boy is so cute. Though Norwegian, he speaks perfect English. How come? The music is great and the scenery too. Who cares about the silly plot! Enjoyed it anyway."
2,Lose the Gorilla,"The first hour of this film was pretty good. The ship scenes were very beautiful, and the plot seemed pretty believable-- eleven year old goes to sea to work as a ship's boy to raise the money to save his family's farm. So far so good--until he is shipwrecked on a desert island. It was then that I couldn't believe my eyes. The fakest looking gorilla comes out of a cave?! Then theres scenes with the silliest looking natives dancing around, and stupid slapstick scenes. Its like they were making it up as they went along. Totally on the level of Gilligan's Island. Avoid this, unless you're under 5."
2,Oh wow. What a waste of money,"I consider myself lucky. I never bought this movie. I watched this movie on the disney channel very late at night-early morning. Even though these movies are usually funny and interesting late at night, this one wasn't. It was so cheesy, mice were watching it. So many holes in the plot, it might as well of been blessed by the pope himself. (get it? Holy...) Under one roof, there were 7 different accents at one time. They were on a farm, THAT GREW NOTHING. IN NORWAY! What do people grow in norway? If they grow boredom, come to my living room. There's a lot of it there. And the whole dancing on the beach scene with a sword? COME ON! So in conclusion, don't see this movie unless you have the IQ of broccoli, or you're a kid. Same thing. P.S. SWING SWING P.S.S. the kid looks like Julie Andrews"
5,...shipwrecked...,"Me and my sister have seen this film a ""few too many"" times. We have even come up with nicknames for the backround characters (ex: Guy On The Log for the man who makes a strange face while crossing the fallen tree) Our number one favorite characters are Captain (Gabriel Byrne) and Ooga (the giant silver-back gorilla who makes all of 3 appearances throughout the movie) We both love this movie and fully recommend it for people of all ages. You haven't seen it enough unless you've watched it all in slow motion. Too bad it isn't here..."
5,One of the best kickass epic series of the century!,Evangelion is a well woven story that keeps you thinking even after you saw all 24 episodes. Amazon might have the DVD format in supply.
5,Evangelion - one of the BEST animes EVER,"Evangelion is one of the best animes ever. It has an awesome story line & great characters. Its both suspenceful and comic. I reccomend it to everyone! If your an Otaku and you havn't seen this one, I pitty you and beg of you to buy this series!"
2,All hat and no cattle,The book got off to an interesting start but soon faded. I found the author's claims about chanting to be farfetched. The title is misleading. The thesis of the book comes down to this: just chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo twice a day to a Gohonzon and you can have whatever you want. This thesis of his does not tie into the rest of the book very well. Mr. Hochswender is a very good writer but this book reads as if it were put together rather haphazardly.
1,misleading packaging,"this book starts off making you think it is going to be about buddhism and u.s. society and how people are coming to buddhism, but it is really just a narrow version of this guy's sect of buddhism. if you already believe exactly as he does, you'll like it. if you believe otherwise, it will be very annoying."
4,Great as an additional resource,"I used these 9 cd's effectively as I studied for the exam. Since they are broken down by CD in to each topic, I read the PMBOK chapter, then read the corresponding chapter in Andy Crowe's book ( The PMP Exam: How to pass on your first try ), then I listened to the CD for that topic. It was great because it reinforced the book knowledge with audio knowledge, as well as applicable examples to relate to.I would also HIGHLY recommend the Andy Crowe book, as well as the Velociteach training."
5,As wonderful as his show,"What can I say! Mr. Rogers couldn't fail at anything he did, even if he tried. This is a lovely book about adoption, beautifully telling in words and pictures what being a family is all about, adoptive or not. It tells just enough about adoption not to confuse the young child but to focus on feelings every child has and how to cope with them. Five stars for Mr. Rogers whom we sorely miss every day. Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
3,"Great content, totally dated","Since when does 1994 qualify to be called ""the olden days""? Fred Rogers' Let's Talk About It: Adoption has great content, very matter of fact about what a family is, what adoption is, and feelings a child may have about it. But, the pictures? Really? Real photos of children and families that are as early 90s as you can get. Call me shallow (no, please don't), but I can barely stand the mom jeans and big hair. This one is staying on my shelf for now since the content is so good--but I am officially requesting that the Putnam & Grosset Group republish this one with either illustrations or new photos (that someone else can cringe at in another 15-20 years).If you want to read more reviews of adoption themed kids books, visit the 2/22/12 post on my blog www(dot)myoverthinking(dot)com"
3,Good and Bad,"It's a great stand for the zune and is really nice looking, charges great and all that, but has really bad reception when trying to tune it to radio."
1,Waste of Money,"First of all, this is a great idea. I loved that this charged my Zune and held it in place so it wasn't sliding all over my car. Too bad that the FM transmitter doesn't work. I had to keep changing channels. Not only that, but it completely stopped working twice. It would still charge, but it wouldn't transmit to my radio at all. I'm currently getting my third one (Belkin has done a great job with their customer service, I'll give them that. They replaced it no questions asked). If this one doesn't work, I can't get my money back, but a credit. Too bad Belkin doesn't have any different kinds of transmitters for the Zune. Meanwhile, I'm without my Zune in my car. At least I have a CD player."
1,Disappointing performance.,Never could get a good signal no matter what frequency I tried. Item quit working after two weeks. Disappointing.
2,Disappointed Performance,"Fisrt, the physical design is great. The arm that holds the Zune is sturdy and flexable. My issue was with the interface to the FM receiver. The distortion was distracting to the point of overshadowing the music. In order to use this in my car, I connected an audit cable from the back of the device to an auddio input to my vehicle. Now to be fair this could have been an issue with the radio. However, no information provided from the manufacturer to determine this. I selected several FM frequencies with no relief. The car it is installed in is an 07 Camry Hybrid."
2,not good,this transmitter doesnt have a very strong signal so the music is staticky and barely audible.
1,Dont Buy,"This transmitter only worked for about 2 months before it crapped out. The audio wasnt very good either had a lot of inteference, some of which was just from the car. If i rolled up or down my windows or turned the heat up it would distort the audio. It had a weak transmission if someone else had a transmitter it would always pick up their signal and play it over mine. This is a waste of money."
2,Could be a whole lot better.. . . .,"We can't win, can we???We, the people who just don't want ipods cannot win, can we?I bought the Belkin FM Transmitter for the Zune. I'm in the suburbs, in New York. Power lines are everywhere. I try the default stations, nothing but static. I look for a random station with nothing on it. I can hear the music, but there's static over the music. It's like listening to AM radio. I unscrew the antennae from my car (not all cars have these, I got lucky), and I get much better reception. . . . .but only for SOME music. God forbid the album you're listening to was recorded before 1987 or has a lot of cymbals. You'll just hear a bunch of noise.It's really a shame. It's possible to make a good FM Transmitter. Look at iTrip. Theirs work great. If only they'd make one for the Zune.Don't bother with this one. It doesn't work well enough for it's price at all."
2,Not the worth the $$$,"I've used other FM transmitters for years. When my latest one broke though, I decided that it would be nice to have a place to store my Zune other than my cupholder or lap. This product does hold and charge the Zune without problem, but the FM signal it puts out is so weak that I have to turn my radio all the way up to barely hear it. I tried the Belkin recommended stations as well as the other stations I sucessfully used in the past and use with my Sirius radio, but nothing would work. I emailed Belkin; I tried different lighter plugs. It didn't matter.I ended up buying a tape adapter to use with this. The nice thing is there's a plug on the bottom to use it.I live close to the middle of nowhere and that doesn't seem to matter with signal, so I would only recommend this product if you plan on buying a tape adapter or some other way of transmitting the signal manually and using this is a stand. It would have been nice to be able to easily move from car to car though."
1,Fancy looking Widget,"This is the biggest waste of money ever.Not only does the FM transmitter not work, but you have no control over volume. Increasing and decreasing the volume on the Zune have no affect on the output volume. I had to turn the car stereo up to 30 just to barely hear it, and of course the static on EVERY CHANNEL made it impossible to listen to, especially at such high volume.Too bad, the design and looks are great, but for the money its far too expensive to keep it to use it solely as a holder/charger.Its going back. Both of them..."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I had heard that the Zune FM transmitter didn't work so I preordered the Belkin figuring that it would be a superior product. Boy was I wrong! The sound is basically worthless amid all of the backround noise and fading in and out. I tried every available FM bandwidth in Chicago and the reception went from bad to worse. Even slightly moving the unit itself changed the reception. I can't belive Belkin would actually sell this piece of junk. If you want to listen to your MP3 in a car, then buy a decent stereo with an audio line-in for a solid connection. The FM transmitters do not work. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"
2,Very poor sound in my car,"While this product is not without some merits, I was unable to use it for its primary purpose. The sound quality through the FM transmitter was so poor I found it completely unusable (in my Honda CR-V). I ended up getting a tape adapter and the sound was MUCH better.The positive of this product is that it does keep the Zune charged and holds it firmly in place (as opposed to other products that require you to secure the Zune in your car using other methods.)"
1,Huge Disappointment,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas. He finally received it in the middle of April. Not only that, but it barely works. It is hard to fit into most 12V sockets, and he reports the FM transmitter is nearly useless. Don't buy this product!"
2,It is Washington DC 's fault,"I just wanted to let everyone know that all new fm transmitters are going to be a bunch of crap. We can give this credit to the US government as they have seen fit to require downgrading all fm transmitters power and therefore they dont work anymore. This is the reason I have had to get an older xm unit,all the new ones dont transmit. I found this out after buying the zune car transmitter. So next time all of our new tech doesnt work just thank Washington. Come on D....C low flow toilets, steroids in baseball, fm transmitters. How about finding money to fix the bridges instead of messing with us and wasting time"
5,"Muy bueno,","Lo compre en amoazon, por que estaba bien barato, jaja, mas que en las tiendas, bien, y funciona muy bien."
2,Failure to deliver on the goods,I love my Ipod model of this product. It suprizes me that Belkin wont get its delivery date right. When you tell someone a date better make sure it it at least close. I have been trying to get this product since November. Then I found it on Amazon. Then as Belkin did last week. The week before shipment they changed the date by 2 months. Unacceptable for me and should be to Amazon also. I only hold Belkin to blame for this. I have bought many things from Amazon. They only tell you what is relayed to them. I wonder how many of these will sell by March this time. Or will it be delayed again. An upset Zune owner.
3,Best use the audio out port,"Overall it is not a bad product but the signal quality varies from one vehicle to another. I have a 2004 Monte Carlo, so the FM antenna is built into the rear window. With the Zune broadcasting from the front of the car I pick up a lot of static. You can still use the audio out port on this device (or the headphone port on the Zune) to plug into your stereo's auxiliary input (if available). This way I experience very good sound quality. Another option would be to use one of those cassette adapters for the audio out, if you have a cassette stereo."
1,BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK EVER!!!!,DO NOT... I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS!!! This is the biggest piece of junk I have tried every frequency this thing puts out and I know that it is not my radio because it works just fine.
1,simply unreliable,"apparently several thousand faulty units were distributed. i received a faulty one, sent it back, and the replacement was faulty also. this was not operator malfunction, customer support informed me of this issue. i stay away from belkin products from now on."
1,Does not work with Zune 80g,This product does not work for the product i bought it to work with. I believe it works with the 30g only but it says this nowhere.
1,Not a FM tuner worth buying...,"The FM turner worked once for me in a parking lot. When I left the parking lot, channel was lost. No other channels worked anywhere at all. It did charge the unit and was easy to install. Over all if you want a charger and holder for car use through a cable, not bad at all. But if you want this for an FM tuner, Don't bother."
4,Forget the FM Tuner part..,"I really love the TuneBase. It looks nice, it's very sturdy, and feels like a quality product. The FM transmitter barely works though, so I use the line out on the bottom of the unit to the line in on my stereo (tape decks will also work w/ a tape adapter)."
5,Awesome Charger,"No problems whatsoever. The transmitter works great even thru the bay area, LA and San Diego. Charger works perfectly and the audio output is great for my new honda civic."
1,Just say NO!,This thing was awful! The quality of sound is absolutely nill! it was like listening to a radio station three counties away! DO NOT PURCHASE!
3,Almost what I wanted,"Everything about the Belkin TuneBase, from design to function is wonderful... except the strength of the FM transmitter. Perhaps it is my Chevy Suburban that is the problem, but as far as I can tell the TuneBase falls short. It securely holds and charges the Microsoft Zune. It's easy to set up and operate, but due to the poor signal strength, my music sounds like it is coming in on a fuzzy FM station."
3,Could be Better,"I have a new Red Mustang Convertible & had hoped my New Zune would be a better choice than a CD Changer in the trunk. I researched, & choose the Belkin F8M026 FM Transmitter & Dock, advertised to play through my FM Radio. There are three (3) imbedded stations, none I could use, and through trial & error found a station that I can play my Zune through.I had a hard time & continue to have difficulties playing my Zune due to static and noises thru the wireless dock. I can't say I would enthusiacsticly endorse the product."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Tried this in 2 cars, signal was too weak for either one. Got my refund very quickly (thanks Amazon - I remain a loyal customer). Other FM transmitters have worked well for me, this one is just very poor."
1,Doesn't work anymore,"I was happy with the products at first, but then the plug kept falling apart. Now it just stopped working completely. Not worth the money for it only to work a few months."
1,"Terrible, did not work","I have had the product for 1 hour and it will be returned ASAP. I called Belkin and that was a useless exercise.I currently use a SIIG Wireless Audio Pro tuned to 88.3 with the car antenna retracted. Works very well (the secret is lower the antenna to minimize adjacent radio station interference). So, I am experienced with these devices. I wanted the Belkin because it is a nice integrated look and no more wires. There was absolutely NO reception on my radio unless I wrapped my hand around the gooseneck. Something is wrong with either the tuning, the antenna, or the power output of this device. I have seen Belkin transmitter hacks on the net that lead me to conclude that it is the antenna. Save your money!"
1,"poor quality reception, when you can get reception at all",This is a product that needs a lot more R and D. It only works when the moon and stars are aligned. Not worth the aggravation of trying to synchronize this tuner with the radio tuner. Very dissatisfied.
3,more of a question.,"I got a belkin fm transmitter to use back and forth to school. For now i'd give it about a 2.5. It seems like the way it plugs into the outlet is wrong. The manual that came with it is useless... are you suppose to take the foam ring off of it if it's getting bent out of shape. If you know, let me know what to do!"
5,awsome product for hands free operation in the car,"yeah you can keep your zune in the seat next to you or balance it somewhere inbetween your stick shift, but that looks ghetto, and totally unprofessional. also, with this, you can watch movies alot easier, as well as switch through songs with ease. taking your eyes off the road to fool with the zune...dumb idea, getting this handy device, smart idea. get it...so you stay safe, and don't look poor ;)"
1,Rip Off,This item is seriously a waste of money it does not work at all. And if you are lucky enough to get any fequency there is a lot of static in the background. The only i was able to use this item for was to charge my zune. But I highly recommend you save your money on this one. Defenitely not worth the $50 something bucks I paid for.
1,Not compatible with 80GB Zune,"Beware!!!this product is not compatible with the new Zune, other accesories are compatible with the new zune, but this is not one of them, they should add a note telling this or put it in the product description"
4,"Sucks as a FM transmitter, but is a great holder and charger","Ok i bought this thing knowing that FM tuners suck, i just wanted something to hold/charge my Zune where i could easily see and control it.This works decently for what i wanted. It holds the zune securely in place where i can reach the controls without having to take my hand off the wheel. My only complaint is that the fixed volume level output that i run to the aux input on my head unit isn't a strong enough signal. In other words i have to turn the head unit up too high in order to reach the same volume i would with any other source (CD, Sirius, changer).The Zune itself puts out a stronger signal than the tunebase does. Maybe i am just too picky but i would like it better if the volume level matched the rest of my car stereo. I think a headphone amp would fix this problem."
3,not for 120,I just ordered one of these and it arrived today. When I couldn't get my Zune to plug into it I did a little searching on the Belkin website. Apparently this is only for older models of the Zune and doesn't work on the 80 or 120 GB models. I didn't search any farther to see what models it does work with but since I didn't come across this info in the description or any of the reviews I read on here I figured I would post it up. Its a shame. I really like the design.
1,Zune 120 Compatability,The new Zune 120GB will not fit into the base. The connection pin does not line up...
1,FM Transmitter stopped working,"My FM Transmitter stopped working about a week after I bought my Belkin Tunebase FM for Zune. Not a great loss though since the sound was terrible to say the least. At least it charges my zune and functions decently as a place to mount my zune. Still, I am very disappointed this product broke after just one week."
2,should have listened,Was very pleased and excited at first until i tried to find another station. wouldnt pick up another unused channel. i had 2 already programed and tried to get a third and it wouldnt work. and it really doesnt hold the zune up. i have to keep adjusting everytime i go over a bump. looks good but not really. should have really listened to the other reviews. and i live in a smaller city so i thought it would work better. and it doesnt
2,"Crappy transmitter, Good charger / holder","As an FM transmitter, this unit is sorely underpowered and can barely compete with stations that normally receive nothing more than static. Unfortunately, this is the ONLY factor upon which the total performance of this product hinges, so that's quite bad.On the upside however it's a fantastic holder for your Zune, and is a good car charger to boot (the only reason it gets a second star). Underneath, there is a line out jack as well, which means (although though I haven't tried it) you should be able to leave this unit in your car, plugged into the line in jack on your stereo, and never have to worry about hooking up every time you get in your car. Just slap in your Zune and go!In conclusion, given the fact that it's a pretty useless transmitter, even the good points made above still don't justify the $50 pricetag."
1,Zune FM Transmitter,"So far a non-starter. There are no switches, dials, etc. on the unit so it's pretty much consumer proof yet it's broadcast signal is so low my radio can't pick up the signal regardless of the station I set it at.Mechanically it works fine and the LED ligths up to indicate its running but would definately NOT recommend this unit."
1,"Not able to rate less than ""1""",This is by far the worst fm transmitter I've ever used. The charger works great though. It's quite nice to look at too. The transmitter is way to weak. You can block the signal with your hand. I'm using a cheap $10 transmitter that kicks this ones but till i can get a better one. Try to avoid this one if you can.
3,looks good sounds bad,like everyone else my car dock sounds pretty bad on all stations in a ford ranger. I noticed though that in my other truck (dodge ram) the noise goes away on all stations if I turn on my cd changer which is also transmitted to my car stereo through an FM station. SO . . . I need to find another FM device to play my zune through with the dock and maybe that will clear it up.
1,Absolute rip off and waste of money!,This transmitter/base is and absolute piece of useless junk. I should have read the reviews before this purchase. Don't make the same error.-1 stars would be a better rating.
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is the worst transmitter I've ever seen.It looks really cool and has great functionality, but the transmitter is pitiful.The Belkin Universal works great, so I assumed that this premium Belkin product would work great also, if not better...I was sadly mistaken. I used it in two different cars, in different areas arond the city and subrubs, on every FM station in the frequency spectrum possible, and it was a horrible waste of money."
3,belkin zune reciever/charger,IMO the output on the thing is much less then it could be. that said being what i consider a crafty little devil that i am i got to thinking how to get the reception to be better and i find if you plug a wire into the bottom output jack and leave some headphones in the top and hang them from your rearview mirror or something you can get some decent reception Albeit there may be some areas where its not so great but you can usually drive right through them and continue jamming out with out to much interruption. but if they ever came out with a Part 2 for this product i HOPE and Pray that they fix the output on its tuning thinger.. otherwise nice stand and she charges nicely.. actually i wish they could make it where you could turn the charger bit on and off.. but now im probly dreaming haha im happy with it.. but i t could be better
2,Where is your car antenna?,My particular car has the antenna in the rear of the vehicle and I cannot get the transmitter to play without static.
2,50-50,"This product works best for me if it is not operated near the car stereo. In one of my vehicles the outlet is directly below the car stereo. No matter what station I used, I was not able to operate this device. However, when I used it in my other car where the outlet is near me and a few feet away from the car stereo it worked A LITTLE better. I still experienced quite a bit of static and have to at times place my hand on the device to get a clearer signal. I purchased the Zune brand FM transmitter and though it does not offer the ability to position my player the signal is much better and I am able to enjoy my player in most areas of town."
2,Half way there...,"I have tried three different tuners for my Zune, including the Belkin. Two of which connect to the car radio (FM) ok. However, I would like to charge my player as well.When I received the Belkin it was, or so I thought, the device I was looking for. Upon pluging into the device (Belkin) I was happy to have it in an convinent location and charging my player. However, I will not tune clearly to ANY FM station. Also, I now get a low buzz from the cars alternater.I own a newer Xterra and have not experienced this noise since my first car stereo 10 years ago. Too bad, I was really hoping for a killer product.~Disapointed"
2,Belkin TuneBase Fm Transmitter,"Very bad, unit does not have enough power to transmit a decent signal to the FM radio in my Automobile. The signal is weak at best and can not be heard most of the time. To hear it at all you have to turn the radio volume way up and then most of the time it will not even receive a signal on 95 percent of the available frequencies. No good."
2,2ND GEN ZUNE WILL NOT WORK,"AS NOT STATED IN THE PRODUCT INFO, THIS UNIT WILL NOT WORK WITH THE 2ND GEN ZUNE(SMALLER ONE) I FOUND THIS OUT AFTER RETURNING ONE THEN HAD SAME PROBLEM WITH SECOND ONE. THE CHARGER WORKS FINE BUT THE TUNER WILL NOT POWER UP AT ALL.AS ALL THIS WAS THROUGH MAIL ORDER IT WAS A PAIN. THANK YOU BELKIN FOR THE GREAT INFO!!!"
1,just plain horrible,I really wish i could have known to read the reviews b4 i spent money on this product it really sucks thank you for nothing.
1,Terrible,I not gonna lie to you. I reviewed all of the other opinions on this belkin transmitter for the zune and the negative reviews were accurate. This Belkin FM transmitter is horrendous. When I had it i would take a drive and every other second static would drown out the whole entire song. the only good thing about it was that if your in a certain area the song plays clearly but even with that the volume is so low i literally had the volume in my car all the way up and the sound was still low. Another thing that bugged me about this was the rubber or flexible thing attached to the transmitter was not sturdy enough. every time i made a turn the transmitter would fall to the side which was really aggravating. My advice if you really want to play your MP3 player through your car speakers my suggestion is to just buy one of those car mp3 CD decks from best buy
1,Disappointed,I buy this thing and it won't even turn on WTF is going on here i thought maybe I could trust amazon to put things that work on their site but i guess Not. I will be gettin my refund.
4,Appropriate for very young viewers,"I have nieces age 9 and 5. We watched this movie on the telly and they both LOVED it and want it on video. While I am a Shakespeare fan and was delighted with their enthusiasm and understanding of the plot, I would not have wished them to see the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey, due to the nudity. This is an excellent introduction to the Bard for the kids. Mr. Howard keeps both feet on the floor, as it were."
3,"be a fan boy, or suffer","i'll be brief.pros-great musicdecent storyit's more samurai champloo storiescons-play control a bit twitchylong long long load times and lots of themvery few save opportunities so it's a time killing game.if you have the time to invest and love the show, it's really a must have. this is not a game for the weak of will. it takes a while to get the play controls down and when you have to replay the levels over and over after dying, it will devour your free time."
2,disappointing,"Great series... very poor game.Does not live up to the standard set by the tv series. Poor graphics, poor animation, disjointed storyline, poor gameplay (99% button tapping), and huuuuge load times between every bad animated filler. The game was obviously rushed to completion to capitalize on the popularity of the tv series.Looking for a great ps2 game? Try Ghost In The Shell."
4,Samurai Damyu,"This game is superb if you truly enjoyed the anime,then your most probably going to like this game as long as you like video games.The action is slow at first but once you learn the combos and the other fighting abilities this game is very fun.If you weren't a big fan of the anime then there's better button mashers out there but if you already have the best ones out there then this ones worth picking up.I gave this game an 8 on controls a 9.5 on graphics and a 7 on the story and all other aspects of the game for an 8.5,I personally expected more from this gme but I enjoy it just the same."
4,Rolodex covered card tray,"This was great for my needs, small and covered, I keep it in a cabinet instead of a desktop. It came with the index card ""G"" missing but I can deal with that. It is a very good quality item."
5,EXCELLENT,"This purchased shocked me! I was expecting a paperback book, and this is a hard copy, coffee table sized book, filled with great photos and good reading!"
3,A good but not great book,"Having read this book cover to cover and thoroughly enjoyed it, I have to to say it is a good book, though not a great book.If you are thinking of buying this book as a means to establishing a sound repeating swing, I would strongly recommend reading Faldos, A Swing For Life, first. It will provide a solid foundation for the advanced techniques in this book.Tiger is no doubt the best the game has ever seen, but I think Faldos book will help most amateurs more."
5,Colourful and informative,This is a beautiful book with wonderful colourful photos. I will refer to this book time and time again over my golfing career.
5,How I Play Golf,Tiger Woods does an amazing job with this book. His 306 pages of great golf lessons is unbelievable. Tiger takes you from being on the green to having to hit through trees. Woods will also talk about his life for a bit.
2,"Tiger Woods ""How I play GOlf?"" Read Golf Digest!","I was eagerly awaiting the release of Tigers new book .. finally ..Tiger in his own words would breakdown the golf swing! I don't know about anyone else but I was expecting a helluva lot more .. where were the detailed descriptions? I found too little to be useful ! What I did find was a rehash of ""old"" Golf Digest articles .. All supposedly authored by Tiger himself? This book didn""t even try to rewrite or update these articles .. they even used the same photographs !!! Now for those of you that think that Tiger Woods is a golf god .. my words will be unkindly viewed, that however does not diminish my observation that Tiger had an opportunity to write the next "" 5 Lessons"" and fell far short of the goal."
4,Tigeriffic!!,"Tiger is such a superior athlete, its a pleasure to read this book, not only is it informative,and inspirational,the photos are outstanding and the mental tips, great! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that my wife and I, golf in the North East, we don't have the luxury to golf all year round. One of our greatest concerns being in our 40s is maintaining fit and flexible during the off season. It would be wonderful if that wasn't the case and we could incorporate Mr. Woods excellent advice all year round. I would highly recomend 'Exercises for Golf' by Kelly Blackburn and 'Golf Flex' by Paul Frediani. Because if your not fit its hard to concentrate on your technique."
5,Just what I expected :-),This is probably the best golf instruction book I have ever read. The contents are neatly organised and every aspect is clearly illustrated by the use of appropriate photos.
5,"Tiger Woods, How I play Golf",Could not ask for better service! I sent the book as a gift. It arrived right on time. Great Book - Great Service!
3,Tiger Woods - How I Play Golf,An exceptional book with good illustrations & bought at a very good price. Postage time was VERY DISAPPOINTING - expected to receive within 3-4 weeks (standard Air Freight) but took 6 weeks!!! This was our 1st purchase on Amazon & we were concerned and had almost given up on it! Expect DELAYS on overseas purchases.
4,Worth to take a look,"This book have some useful tips about how to play and manage the course. Lots of pictures, which I believe won't be as attractive as several years ago. Tiger on the pictures looks so young and comparing to currently, an era is end.Anyway, don't think you can be Tiger after reading this book, most of the topics on this book are pretty common."
5,Tiger Woods How to Play Golf,This book was written before Tiger's problems and has excellent points. His game is affected by his troubles today and not by the book. I recommend it to anyone.
2,Big Book Does Not Equal Big Return.,"We all like Tiger and what he has brought to the game, but I have to questions some of the positive reviews I've seen about this book. If you take golf seriously (at any level of ability), this will offer little more to your arsenal than the most basic of basics. This is more a tribute to Tiger and less about what this young master can teach you. It takes about 3 hours to go through and the entire time I wondered if it was Tiger or Butch Harmon speaking. You can't go wrong with Nicklaus, Hogan, or any of the contemporary teachers. Take lessons, they are worth the money!"
3,Not Great,Not as much instruction and tips as I would have hoped. A bt disapointed. Wish I didn't buy it. Dont reccomnd it.
4,Good coffee table golf book,"Just like the author of it, the book is heavyweight, literally. In fact, this book is so heavy I can't hold them in bed for more than 10 minutes.About the contents, the editors of golf digest definitely have done a good job putting up this book. Although, in my opinion, it's not much different from their ""break 100, 90 and 80"". In this regard, this book is no better or worse than others on the market. The information is there, but what feels like a ""relaxed and poised swing"" could mean 350 yards to Tiger and 150 yards to you. Then again, it's hard to describe a ""feel"" with words.Overall, this is a good book if not the best. Pretty much covered every aspect of the game. But by just reading it won't make you a better golfer, you still have to practice, a lot."
4,Tiger Woods book,I've only read a couple of chapters but from that sample the book is very good.The book is an easy read- informative without being technical and the right amount of anecdote is mixed in.The only negative I can find so far is the actual writing style. After hearing him talk & realizing his age at the time of publication the words don't seem to be his voice. It seems that editors style is most prevalent. It's not a problem once you get used to it though it was a disappointment at first.
3,"Practice, practice, practice...","We only see the glamour of success, the impossible putt, the droll delivery of a comic. What we don't see is what this book can not give you. That is the mind-numbing tedium of practice and refinement of technique.Buy this for advice, but a book on golf does not a golfer make."
3,Nothing new,Tiger Woods is a great player there is no doubt. His book is a great addition to the golf instruction world. I didn't buy the book but I did read through it at the bookstore and I realized that much of what Tiger has to say is all based on the fundamentals. Nothing new. What most amateurs fail to realize is that Tiger Woods has worked his butt off mastering the fundamentals. All great athletes do that. Many weekend hackers will never break 100 because they fail to practice and master the fundamentals. Tiger Woods is known for his long game but it isn't a mistake that he starts off with putting. The short game should make up about 60% of a person't practice. I see so many people hitting hundreds of balls with their driver trying to hit the ball harder and longer but never work on their short game. My favorite player is Colin Montgomerie. I think he has the greatest swing in golf and is much more consistent than Tiger Woods. Let's also not forget Ben Hogan.
5,Keith Jarrett - the Hands of an American,"There's a 2-CD set of these 24 preludes and fugues by Ashkenazy. The Ashkenazy version sounds absolutely stolid next to these silvery readings by Jarrett. Now, there IS the issue of technique... Once could, quite easily, pick on some of Jarrett's voicings, or his broken chords vs. pure sonorities... But while Ashkenazy's performance is sturdy and craftsmanlike, Jarrett's is painterly and fluid. Listen to the first selection on CD number 2 - the bird-like Prelude in F-sharp Major, and the following fugue, a glorious, long-breathed song in five parts... there is such LIFE in Jarrett's hands here! Pick and choose your favorites from among the 24... program your CD player to play your favorites as a suite... Listen for the influences of Debussy, Prokofiev, and most of all, Bach... And thank producer Manfred Eicher for his crystalline sound. 5 stars"
3,SONG TRACK INFO WRONG,"The song track listing above, is for the Hi Gloss whole CD, not this single. The single has three tracks:1. You'll Never Know-Hi Gloss2. Dyin' To Be Dancin'-Empress3. Dyin' To Be Dancin'(Instrumental)-Empress"
2,Too many ads,"If you're looking for a shopping guide for Christmas, from L.L. Bean to Starbucks, this book is for you. Every other page is a compendium of ads. If this isn't what you're looking for, pass."
5,gift,"this was an early christmas gift to myself :) I check out this book yearly from the library, now I can read this all year. recieved item very quickly, thank you!!"
4,enjoyable,"Will work on Vista. You just have to make sure you press F8 key to get the menu at the top of the screen to exit the game or pause the game. Some of the games on this CD are easy to beat and some are hard. Must play by keyboard and not a joy stick, but that is not a problem. I have not changed the ""compatibility"" to run in a different window's version. If you like pac man you will like this game pack."
1,Tallchief: The Homecoming,"I was very disappointed in this book. I usually always love Cait London novels, but this one is the exception. I tried to keep reading this book, but I just had to give it up. I really didn't like Michelle at all. I'm very disappointed to say that I just had to give up three parts through the book. Just couldn't get interested. Liam was lovely but why the heroine had to be like she was, I don't understand. Awful!"
4,A New Member To The Tallchief's Saga,"Cait London has written another good book to the Tallchief saga.This book is about Liam Tallchief and his search for the family he never knew about. His quest is not only for himself, but also for is young son. If you have liked and loved the Tallchiefs, then you must read this book, and hope Ms. London keeps them comming."
2,From Back Cover,"'I SHOULD'VE SAID YOU WERE A STOLEN BABY... YOUR NAME IS TALLCHIEF.'The discovery of his heritage still raw, brooding Liam pledged to reclaim his birthright for his young son's sake. But he didn't need help from sassy-mouthed, high-class Michelle Farrell, a woman bent on unraveling his mysteries while weaving him into the Tallchief clan fabric...Liam's unrefined, manly essence challenged Michelle. If ever a man needed the love and belonging of a family, he did. Though Liam wasn't a man to walk away from, Michelle wasn't a woman for staying. So when he kissed her as if she were rightfully his, why did she feel a fierce urge to claim him?8th in The Tallchiefs series; 2nd in the Body & Soul series."
1,Levitt tries too hard to impress us with his big words.,"The Marketing Imagination is a classic example of educated foolishness. I'll admit the book starts off easy to follow. There are a lot of strong examples and points that help to illustrate just what Levitt is trying to get across. But, by the end of the first chapter, Levitt gets into this zone, where every word has to be four syllables. I spent more time grabbing my dictionary than reading his book. What a shame. I'm a graduate student, who has been assigned this text to read for class. It looks like it will be a long semester. If you are interested in maketing, PR or any other related field, save yourself a serious headache and choose another piece. And to Levitt if you should happen to read this review, don't take this too personal but when writing works such as this always remember (KISS) Keep it simple, sir!"
2,Too Out-of-date to Be Useful,"This book may have been useful when it first came out 25 years ago but it is too dated to be applicable today. While I often find gems of information in older books, this doesn't happen to be one of them. Save your money or buy it used."
2,"Outdated, lacks substance, dwells on marketing basics","I bought this book based one some of the reviews on this site. Unfortunately, this time they failed me. The book is outdated (as it was published 20 years ago) and lacks substance. If you have little or no knowledge of marketing, this might be a decent intro for you. It is relatively easy to read and dwells on few main concepts. However, if you have taken a marketing course in college or have read much on marketing, you will likely find this book dull and uninformative, as I did. Many of the big revelations in the book seem to me to be common sense. Maybe 20 years ago it was revolutionary, but somehow I doubt it. Also, some of the arguments he makes early in the book have been proven wrong by history...All in all, I would probably avoid this book. I was hoping to get some new insights, but this book sure didn't help. If you must buy it, buy a used copy as it certainly isn't worth [the money]."
1,"So far, not happy","So far, my treadmill does not work. Upon receiving and assembling, the touch pad controls don't work, period. The console turns on, but that is as far as it gets. I have left a message and email with Horizon customer service - I will see how that goes. From my experience thus far, I would not recommend this treadmill!!"
1,Didn't get it,"I decided that I would side step second hand information and went directly to the source--picked up a copy of ""Rules for Radicals"" instead."
4,An excellent book for TBI relatives and friends,"It is a disappointment that people, especially kids, are not told she wasn't wearing a helmet while riding her bike. I never fail to tell kids that if I hadn't had my own, not-a-beatup-loaner, approved motorcycle helmet on when I crashed a hang glider, I would have died for sure as I came back from a coma etc. to a good life. Just a little more damage from a poor helmet would have killed me, or turned me into a life support cabbage.the book is very good otherwise, and I recommend it to anyone trying to understand how someone with TBI can do some things fine, but not others.Best description of TBI I have made up, which could be applied to hers; Your brain is a map on the wall. Close your eyes, reach behind you and grab an unknown number of darts. Throw them blindly at the map. Some areas get hit, some don't, some totalled. It's not an IQ thing."
5,A must-read for anyone suffering loss of cognition and self.,"Publishers Weekly, reviewed Over My Head on March 15, 1998, and said, ""This is an exceptionally well written and engaging account of one woman's experiences, thoughts, feelings and relationships as she slowly navigates a terrible corner in her life and ultimately finds a new identity."" This should be a must-read for tbi and medical professionals but would be valuable to anyone grieving over their loss of cognition and identity."
4,Head Injury-As seen by a former professional,"I am a survivor of a severe Brain Injury and former professional. After reading this book, I can see I am not alone and unique. I welcome her testimony."
5,Over My Head,An excellent book to give understanding about those who have had a traumatic brain injury.I ordered Over My Head from Amazon.com. I enjoyed reading it and passed it on to a friend to read.
5,A real Eye-opener,"As a Paediatric Surgeon, I have been responsible for the care of many children with acute Brain Injuries. However, I have never been able to follow them up over years following such injuries. A friend loaned me this book because of the fact that her son-in law was suffering the long-term effects of a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I then realised that I will need to alter my practice and follow these patients for a much longer time. What really frightened me was just how short a time Dr Osborn was unconscious and how devastating her injury has been. This might be a good book to give to teenagers and young adults who think that the risks they take in cars and on bikes may have consequences far greater than they appreciate."
