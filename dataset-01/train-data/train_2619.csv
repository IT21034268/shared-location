4,"great product, some things to improve thought","please improve the grill attachment system. Almost always, I spend several minutes trying to put the grills in place without falling over.besides that detail, I'm pleased with my purchase... I use it everyday!!!"
2,not hot enough,"The removable plates make it really easy to clean the grill... they even go in the dishwasher. However, the temperature is too low. The manual says that if you're not getting grill marks on your food, then you didn't let it preheat long enough. I gave it fifteen minutes, and still no grill marks. This can't replace a traditional grill, but it's not a terrible option for an indoor grill."
2,George Foreman GRP4 Next Grilleration,"This unit was recommended for making panini type sandwiches......It does not do a good job on paninis.....The grill does not get hot enough to toast the sandwiches unless they are left in the grill for long periods of time....The grill also does not allow putting any pressure or lock down force which would help the grilling process...no grill marks show even though the grill was preheated for approximately 10 minutes prior to use and the ready light cycled several times....it might be good for products that cook slower, like a pork chop or chicken breast, but I haven't tried that yet.....I truly wish I had not purchased this appliance as it does not do what I had hoped it would making speciality sandwiches.....if all you want is a grilled cheese sandwich on white bread, then it might be good for you....!!! One of the tags suggested by Amazon for this review is ""panini grill"".... don't believe it..."
3,"Quick & easy, but doesn't brown meat.","I was so excited to get my George Foreman.....couldn't wait to use it! I've used it quite a bit by now, and although it is fast and easy to clean up after, it doesn't brown or ""grill"" the meat.....steak comes out looking a little grayish, which would be more than a little offsetting if I wasn't a total carnivore. I guess the real way to rate this is to ask if I would buy it again, and the answer is no....it's upside in no way makes up for having to eat gray meat."
1,Worst and most dangerous grill,As soon as I plugged it in the top cover of the grill started deforming and bubbles started building up in the top cover and it was bulging. Another disadvantage of this product is that it has no power on or off buttons and you can't even control the temperature of the grill that is very disappointing. Food sticks to the plates no matter what you do. and the bottem part of the grill scratches the surface of the counter because there's no rubber over the two corners of the bottom part. As far as the smell of food is concerned its ok. I wont say its amazing.
1,Piece of Junk.,"Had an old single meal Foreman Grill for 7 years. I decided to replace with something larger. So I chose the Foreman GRP4 with removable plates. I received the grill and decided to plug it in to make sure it worked. As I plugged it in for the first time. The light came on then warmed up and the light went out. And that was it. It never came back on after that. I checked the connection, but all was okay. It was just a piece of junk. I didn't even get to cook anything on it. I just threw it in the trash and went back to using my old grill."
1,Sent back grill,"I got this grill and it looked great but the hinge was broke so I sent it back. This company still has my money and never shipped me a new grill. This was a gift for my son who left state. I am furious! Everytime I call them, they are not open! I recommend the grill but not this company!"
3,Some thing should be improved.,"Back Foot area of plastic body is already broken when it was delivered.I think , plastic part is not strong.Also Both lock of pan plate is not accurate. So there is some loose after attaching pan plate."
5,How Did We Live W/out It?,"The Foreman grill makes healthy cooking quick and easy. It's amazing the amount of grease that you see from the things you cook, even from ""lean"" meats. This grill helps me eat healthy and keep the weight off. Then once your done all you do is pop off the grill plates and put them in the dishwasher for easy clean up. It doesn't get much better than this. I would recommend this grill to any and everyone I know!"
4,its good,"everything you expect from a forman grill. straight forward easy to use.one tiny issue, FOUR burger? better cooking two at a time, or four very small ones at once. other than that, perfect"
5,How did we ever live without it?,"I've had the GRP4P for over a year now, got it from Macy's on sale. What can I say about this grill that hasn't been said before?! Just fabulous! After a 2-hr commute back from work, all I do is switch it on, let it heat up, simply spray a bit of olive oil on the surface and lay my marinated, defrosted (sometimes not) chicken or steak or fish or burgers on it, and ---walk----a----way. 20 minutes (and 40 winks) later...dinner! Some of the nonstick has worn off at the edges of the bottom plate, but the Grill works as great as ever. Am deciding whether to give the old girl some rest and buy the bigger one with the 5 interchangeable plates. Have read some negative reviews on that on a home shopping site, regrding the fit of the top plate. But I'll probably buy from Macy's or Fortunoff again. How did we live before it?"
3,It's okay but not as great as everyone else says!,"The grill heats up quickly and cooks well; the grill plates come out easily but go back in with difficulty. They don't seem to want to stay put when I place them back. And yes, I'm using the release clips. They clean easily. It's okay but not as great as I thought it would be."
3,good?,"very disappointed in the size of the grill space, should be told the grill plate size when ordering. works well, just not as big as we wanted"
3,"It's OK, but overall disappointing.","I was really excited to get this grill, but was so disappointed.PROS: The only great feature is the removable grill plates. I love this because it makes clean-up so much easier.CONS:1. The grill is not as big as it looks. The external shape and size are misleading.2. The grill does not heat up well!!!!!!!! No matter how long I let it pre-heat, once I put food on it, it never heats up enough to properly cook food unless I leave it on there for a long time. Then, the food dries out!"
4,Finally you can clean in the dishwasher!!,Finally a grill that you can put the plates in the dishwasher. Old grills got so gross and hard to clean. This one is a breeze and you just throw the plates in the wash and you are good to go. Worth the upgrade.
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"LOVE LOVE LOVE is all I have to really say about it. It cooks really good and definately gets the fat out. We broke one of the handles on ours but it still works good. The only think that i dislike about it is that their is not an off/on switch, it just turns on and stays on if it is plugged in.I think it should have came w/ 2 spatulas not one and some extra cleaning brushes, the brushes make it really easy to clean even when you have a big mess."
1,Should be priced at 50 cents,Disappointing. This is merely a one page book review. Save your money unless a one page book review is worth $5.95 to you.
5,First installment of an excellent series,"Watch Dave Stotts drive a Smart Car around Rome and fight as a ""pretend"" gladiator while presenting New Testament history in a highly entertaining way. I bought the first two disks for my kids, thoroughly enjoyed them myself, and will definitely buy the second two. Focus On The Family commissioned this excellent series. Sometimes Dave gets a little silly, and it's all in the name of making what could be a boring topic more interesting. The re-telling of the legend of the founding of Rome is hilarious, and to say more would be a giveaway. The audio commentary is unique - the filmmakers recorded it in a moving car while traveling through Colorado."
3,Well done,Very informative in a fun format. This is one of the earlier in the series. The newer ones are even better.
4,not the most complete anthology,"I've always loved the Hollies, but if you want a more complete sample of their oeuvre (including several major British hits that were not released in the U.S.), try the ""20 Golden Greats"" cd."
5,Fantastic!,The opening guitar sequence in Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress is more than worth the price of the whole CD!
1,Unable to purchase,I would love to buy this item yet was unable to . For some reason it was taken off my order.
1,rival needs to be accessible,the handle on my lid broke.also the handles on the crock are cracked hasnever been carried.trying to find a number for rival to order parts.all i have found is site after site with people complaing about the sameproblemhas the lid been recalled.
1,Poor Quality,"This is a beautiful crock pot. Unfortunately, it is not good quality. The hinge broke off almost immediately but I lived with it. Then the ceramic insert cracked. I thought it was something I had done but then when I went to replace it I found 27 reviews where the ceramic insert cracked. This is a defective product. I am not sure why they still sell it."
1,Diasppointed in this Crock,"My hinge broke after the first use, but I was willing to live without it. Unfortunately, after the third time of using this crock, I noticed a very pronounced cracking sound coming from the lid of the crock. Where the hinge was once attached, the screws were left to cause the glass of the lid to slowly crack from exposure. Also, the screws attached to the metal part of the crock were becoming increasingly hot because the insulator of the plastic hinge was no longer there, which meant I was afraid of getting severely burnt.I tried taking it back to where I purchased it, and they were not able to offer any remedy because I had used it three times despite this purchase still being within the 90 day refund with a receipt period. Alas, I kept the stoneware but threw away the hazardous parts. I'm not sure what I will do with the pretty stoneware because it doesn't fit well in the new slow cooker. Perhaps, I'll drill a hole in the bottom and make a planter out of it."
3,The plot is...,The plot is good... sometimesThe plot is long-winded... more than onceThe plot is thrilling... maybe twice or thriceThe plot is... to read it if you don't have anything else to read
1,Disappointed Pages Missing,"Disappointed with this book because numerous pages were missing, some completely blank. I returned item and reordered only to find the second book was exactly the same, pages missing, blank pages, etc. I am now waiting for my refunds and return postage credits to appear on my credit card."
4,I'm a fun collectable,All the M&M Star Wars figures are great. I like each one of them and I think as a collector you would enjoy having these in your collection too. Obi-Wan is my favorite. But if you see the R2-D2 and C-3PO grab them! R2 is just too cute.
1,improper description,the product packaging does not purport to support Mac. Our addtional efforts were fruitless and the product was returned.
4,"IF YOU TRULY LOVE ""PARIS""","If ""Paris"" is your scent of choice, this 4.2 oz. bottle may be for you.Of course, ""I Love Paris"" is easy humming, and ""Paris"" by Yves Saint Laurent is easy wearing.YSL would have us know that this fragrance is inspired by the city many consider to be the most romantic and beautiful in the world. Whatever the inspiration ""Paris"" reminds one of a floral bouquet with rich tones of roses. mimosa, geranium, and iris. There are also very subtle overlays of amber and musk.The bottle is as lovely as a YSL design. Collectors will enjoy the bottle long after the frgrance is gone."
4,"FOR THOSE WHO TRULY LOVE ""PARIS""","If ""Paris"" is your scent and you truly love this fragrance, this 4.2 oz. bottle may well be for you.Of course, ""I Love Paris"" is easy humming, and ""Paris"" by Yves Saint Laurent is easy wearing.YSL would have us know that this fragrance is inspired by the city many consider to be the most romantic and beautiful in the world.

1,is this a fake?,"I've been wearing YSL Paris Eau de Toilette Spray for ~25 years and know the scent very well. This product does not smell right! And, the scent it does have is very short-lived. So, either this is an imitation product, or it is so old that it degraded in the bottle. Perhaps it had not been stored properly. I bought this particular item because of the larger size (4.2 oz); perfume shops (and other amazon.com vendors) carry only the smaller sizes."
5,LOVE THIS PERFUME,My order came quickly and I am very happy with it. The fragrance is as nice as the Paris Perfume my friend picked up for me in Paris!!!!
5,Excellent Product,I purchased Paris for my mother who has been a Paris user for years. The stores stopped selling it so I would search the internet for a good price and reputable dealer. The item arrived earlier than expected in excellent packaging. I purchased a larger size just in case I couldn't find a good deal in the future. The item is great. Paris has a unique scent and lasts all day. It is very feminine and light. Amazon had the best deal on this item.
4,Haunting,"I read the book when I was younger and kept a copy with me for the longest time and then in my travels I somehow misplaced it...It is part of the reason I'm trying to get it again. It is a strange haunting story that has many different twists and turns in the plot. It has some poetry, suspence, and a Edgar Allen Poe-ish quality about it. It is a novel to read and re-read again. The search for this book has made a lot of bookstore staff give me a second strange look, but there's more to the story than meets the reader's eye. It is a classic horror story and should be read."
4,In the family,"In view of the title, I was naturally curious about this book, and had a heck of a time finding a copy. It's not on a par with THE THREE MUSKETEERS, but isn't a bad read at all. Thanks, Alex."
4,I wasn't country before it was cool.,"It's been a long time since I watched Barbara's TV show. I was always impressed about her talent when playing the steel guitar. Anyway, I bought this purely for the song ""I Was Country When country Wasn't Cool"". Unfortunately, country was cool before I liked it. The rest of this CD is very good. If you like the sound of country of old, then this is for you.This is also cheap. If you want to hear more of Barbara without paying more then check this out."
5,my review,"I was very positively surprised when I started reading this book. I had never read anything from this author before and I was imediately immersed in the story.The story, though based on the life of Melisende, the first daughter of King Baldwin of Jerusalem, has enough fiction to make it easily readable and very captivating.The author has been able to recreate the romantic atmosphere of the times, with Knights fighting for the ""true"" religion andwomen who had the courage and character to be true Kings, but could not for their sex.All characters are so vividly described, you cannot but feel you know them and want to find out what happens to them. The places are very well described and feel as real and ancient as they are.All in all, a very good book and very enjoyable."
4,Even though dated this book provides timeless advice,"While the authors have updated this book since its original publishing in 1991 there still remains some classic advice for driving fear out of the workplace and building a culture of trust. I have not read the updated copy however I am confident that there are many topics and words wisdom that remain as core threads throughout each.The major downside to this book is how dated it is...legal environment changes, technology advancements and other areas will be better served in the newer edition."
1,Don't waste your money,"When this brush came & I used it for the first time it was wonderful, I have long hair & I didn't use it for a detangler as I have another brush for that. The second time I used it the tips started coming out in my hair & the spikes scratched my head in quite a few places. It's an attractive brush but was certainly a waste of money. I would not recommend it to anyone, better brushes can be had for less than $14. I expected more because of the price & the description posted. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Since I have used it, it can't be returned."
2,Poor,"This is a breezy, poorly-written account that over-emphasizes SC's importance during the late stages of the war, at the expense of Naval affairs and the Yorktown campaign. VERY little original research done for this book (if any) and author resorts to all sorts of fables and myths that have been debunked years ago.Advice: skip it."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Kaneda has confronted Tetsuo again, whether he is arrogant, crazy, cunning, or what, we don't know, but he seems to survive.Tetsuo is having huge problems controlling his abilities and literally is turning into something monstrous.The military types haven't got the message yet, and try and blow up Tetsuo again. He treats it as a power boost, and he and Akira decide to depart.Kaneda and others are left to rebuild."
3,useful for westerners studying pottery in japan,I'll just refer you to a review in Pottery Making Illustrated: http://www.potterymaking.org/zen.htmlsounds like the book would be especially useful for people who are studying pottery in japan and need an explanation for all the strange new tools and so on.
1,Not the right pellet pictured!,This is not the right pellet that is advertised. The pic has the can of the 7.4 gr pellet and I rcieved the 6.9 gr. Oh well!
3,Spongebob!!!,"This compilation dvd includes 10 aquatic adventures! Episodes included according to tvshowsondvd.com are: The Fry Cook Games, Bubblestand, Squid's Day Off, Spongebob Meets the Stranger, Pranks a Lot, Artist Unknown, Grandma's Kisses, Krusty Love, Krab Borg, and The Smoking Peanut. Bring on more season sets!"
5,Great Product!,"I just got this lens and used it with my Kodak DX4530. It took very good photos on the Auto setting. Got a few nice wildlife pictures. It's important to follow the instructions in the manual: (1) to use the optical zoom so that the picture fills the entire view and (2) to use the LCD screen. The blocking of the view finder with the accessory lenses is not unique to Kodak. It happens with other point-and-shoot cameras because of their design. If you want to do more with your point-and-shoot camera, this is a good way to go."
4,Works great!,"I was very hesitant when I bought this lens for my dx7440 camera. I didn't think it would work. However when I tested it I was amazed! It definitely does what it is suppose to do, and doubled my zoom.4 stars because it is not to god at pictures indoors without natural light. Made them very dark, but this is the type of thing you really use in an outdoor setting anyway.Even came with a lens bag."
2,It could have been better ...,"I have got a KODAK DX4530 and I bought an adapter and this telephoto lens. I agree with William Stapleton's review on this lens. The ""tunnel vision"" is very bad and the view in the optical viewfinder is really blocked (I would say 1/3). I am actually very disappointed with that. I haven't taken any pictures yet but I guess I will need to buy more batteries for using the LCD screen. On the other hand if you zoom in the subject is 6x closer as it should be on the optical zoom. That is the only advantage of the lens."
2,Disapointment,"The rolling backpack handle is weaker than it appeared in picture. It is thin, light and not sturdy. The bag itself is not that big and does not have many multi-fuction layers/pockets. The product cost plus shipping fee is over $40.0 and it does not seem a good deal."
4,just as shown,"Arrived in time, just as ordered and works just fine. Not sure of the life of the bulb but hopefully will last 3-5 years."
1,Didn't work in my fixture,"I ordered three of these bulbs with the G24q-1 base, and none of them worked in my light fixture. They flickered faintly if tweaked, so I assume they just don't fit properly. I wouldn't order this brand again."
3,Good for some things,"I use this product to play radio and music transmitted from my bluetooth enabled laptop to my stereo system. It is great for this; I can listen to public radio stations that are otherwise too far away to pick up.But I would like to get another unit to attach to my TV so that I can listen to the TV through my stereo system (without wiring). However, when used as a receiver the DC800 requires that you enter a code (0000) via a keyboard. That is ok if you are transmitting from a computer of phone but not from a TV. I do not understand why they made this necessary; since they don't explain how to change the code it provides no security benefit - it just reduces functionality."
3,Order Enough Of These,"It would have been very nice to have known at the outset I needed one of these devices for each end of the chain. I want to listen to music from my Mac on a boombox located in the livingroom, and only after logging on to Motorola Support did I learn I need one for my Mac and another for my boombox. Since I haven't yet heard any music, it's diffucult to rate the product, so I'll give it a neutral rating of 3 stars."
1,no music,"I got this to play my music from my laptop to my home stero.Laptop has built in bluetooth,and it does not work at all."
3,Works for me,"While the device looks rather plain, it was easy to set up and has worked as expected. I have had no problems with it."
4,As good as I expected.,"I have a Nokia N73 with 2 GB memory, and holds hundreds of mp3 songs. I wanted to able to use my Nokia via bluetooth to play the songs by genres on my home stereo. After research, I decided to go with Motorola DC800. The price is very reasonable $67. It comes with all the necessary audio cable. I just plugged the audio cable into my stereo receiver, and very easy pairing with my Nokia by following the quick start guide. The sound quality is as good as I expected, clear, good range, and very little noise. Some reviewer stated poor sound quality, possibilly due to the reduce quality of mp3 format itselt and not the bluetooth device. Might want to increase the bit rate to 192 instead of standard 128 bit mp3 format.pros: Very affordable price. very small. easy installation.cons: Does not pair with regular motorola bluetooth headset HS850. As stated on the manual, it will pair with motorola stereo headset HT820, and possibilly with other motorola stereo headset like MOTOROKR S9."
1,Wow and flutter is back,"I got my DC800 and plugged it into my stero and began sending music from one of my laptops to the DC800 and driving my stereo. To my surprise the blue tooth magic worked and my songs came out of my home theatre system. Then I noticed that the music would speed up and slow down, just like the old days when your turn table (for you post vinyl people, that is how we played records) began to fail. Its called wow and not the good kind of wow. Clearly the clock circuitry inside this box was changing its frequency and causing a poor conversion from digital to analog. I tried this on a second PC just to be sure it did not have anything to do with the digital stream (would would have been shocked if it had) and I got the same result. This product does not perform as it should. You cannot listen to music sent to your stereo from your computer as it has the very annoying wow."
2,Haven't even gotten it to work yet.,"I bought this product from Amazon for a great price. I have it hooked up to my stereo, and with my built-in Bluetooth on my laptop I was hoping to stream music through my home stereo. So far I am unable to do so, no matter what I do. On top of that Motorola's customer support is completely crap and what little documentation of this problem I find in google has no solutions from anyone. Don't buy this product."
5,Great Product,This is a great product work very well and does exactly what it say it does would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the freedom of wireless technology
4,Range better than average,Can plug into and receive out of your amp. Thus can transmit my ipod songs and hear them on the stereo. Can also listen to xm or tv late at night.Range on par with other bluetooth devices.
1,Out of Sync with Video: Don't Buy for TV!,"Unfortunately, this device introduces a half-second delay into the audio stream, making it unacceptable for television or video use. Using the same sound outputs with a wired headset was perfectly fine, so the problem must be in this unit."
2,Works for some devices but not many,"The device looks good and is easy to setup BUT appears not to work with many computers! While it connected instantly to the bluetooth on my Blackberry, I still haven't managed to connect it to my Sony Vaio (Vista) or macbook (Leopard). A search of the web revealed that many many others have problems (with Dells too) and the workarounds appear long and complicated. I still haven't managed to get it to work with either laptop. I'll spend many hours more trying before giving it up but if you're considering buying this - note that it may not work with your system. (Google the product and 'help' to see what I mean)"
3,The good and the bad,The good:It's a great product in that it converts audio into a Bluetooth signal that can me listened to with a Bluetooth headset as advertised.The bad:You have to pair this thing every time you want to use it. Not sure if it's just this particular unit or a design problem with every one. The extra minute pairing each time is annoying.
4,TV Solution For The Hard of Hearing,I have always had difficulty in understanding movie sound tracks due to a voice range hearing impairment. With the DC800 I can now enjoy televsion once again without having the volume so loud that it is uncomfortable for all others in the room.
4,"A bit pricy, but good quality.","The price if this makes me squirm a bit, but it does exactly what it says it will and it does so well...You can use this for either inputing or outputting audio via bluetooth. At our house we have this hooked up as a 'choke point' to our sound system. In other words, I have all sound running into this gateway first, and then out of this into the sound system. That means that if I ever want to list to audio over my bluetooth headset, all I have to do is turn in the power off on the sound system and turn my bluetooth headset on. It's great for video games or late night movies when your spouse is sleeping and needs to not be woken up.There are a lot of different uses for something like this, so your imagination really is the limit. That being said, I still feel that the price is high for what it is. Sweet spot for me would be $40-50."
2,very disappointed,This item has a very short range. I would not recommend this if you have a lot of distance for your signal to travel.
2,Sound quality may disappoint you!,"Great idea. Very convenient and easy to set up and use, but the noveltyis going to wear off quickly as the sound quality is quite poor.We've used this to stream music from bluetooth devices to a stereosystem and it doesn't perform well, even with the bluetooth audio sourceright next to the DC800. As it buffers the incoming audio, the pitchvaries quite noticeably. It's like playing an old record, with one handon the turn-table alternately slowing and then speeding up the playback.It'll drive you nuts! Save some money and buy yourself a decent cable instead."
2,Poor sound quality - get a wire,"The unit is certainly convenient to use, and pairing is rather straighforward. Range is about 30 ft in my (not very exhaustive) test. BUT: The big issue is sound quality! It brings you back to the time of tapes (muffled sound, missing highs, loss of airiness and vigor) and scratched vinyl records (hiss, and most annoyingly, regular pronounced cracks and pops that sound like bad scratches on the record).A direct A/B comparison of the source CDs (Classical) and 320kbps mp3 rips made from them shows the expected noticeable slight degradation when used with a cable; but when played through this unit, it leads to what I consider unacceptable loss of fidelity, clarity and presence. Why even bother about the digital age when this sounds like a low-to-midrange 60s and 70s setup?"
3,A design tweak would make this really nice,"Many good things about the Cat Box: Private area for cat, steps to reduce litter tracking, dog can't get her head inside. Bad thing: The top and bottom do not 'latch' together securely. With litter weight in bottom, it will fall away from the top if you only grab by the top centered handle. Not a problem if you never need to move it! With a design tweak it would definitely be worth the money."
5,great product,helps keep things cleaner only draw back is that its kind of big you will need a large area for it.
3,Quality from Booda has been dropping,"Our first Booda Dome was purchased a couple years ago at a pet store and has been a solid, reliable litterbox for years. As we grew our furbaby family we needed more boxes so I ordered a pair of these from Amazon. The ones received from Amazon were much more flimsy, the plastic isn't as thick and they don't hold their shape nearly as well. When removing the top of the bin, it can be tricky to get it to line back up properly, something we didn't ever have trouble with on the older model with thicker plastic.The design is solid, just wish they wouldn't skimp on the amount of plastic and end up with a product that feels decidedly cheap in comparison to what they were selling just a year or two earlier."
2,Disappointed,"My cat is pretty average sized, but he refuses to use the BodaDome litter box if the top is on. And no wonder - he'd have to almost crawl on his belly while inside if the top was on. If we have the lid on, he'll go anywhere else but the litter box. Since we took the lid off, he uses it consistently.Because there's no lid on, the Booda filter that's supposed to reduce smell is useless. He doesn't use the stairs and therefore tracks litter all over the house. It's impossible to get bags that fit correctly so they bunch up make it difficult to clean.All in all, I wish I wouldn't have gotten rid of his plain rectangle $10 litter box. This seemed like such a good idea but it's far too small for an average sized cat and is therefore just a bigger pain than before."
1,Breaks Within a Few Days,"I bought two of these for my two new shelter cats because the design seemed like a good idea. It is. Unfortunately, the manufacture is cheap and shoddy, so the design really never gets a chance to work. The latches which hold closed the charcoal filter traps lasted only a few days each. Without the latch, the trap can't hold the filters. If I want to use the filters, which was a main reason for buying the boxes, I have to duct tape the doors closed. Then the cats play with the tape, pull open the doors, and run around the house playing with, and shredding, the charcoal filters. So, if odor control is your motivation, find something better. This doesn't do it."
2,Urine all over,"This seemed like such a great box but the urine seeps through and I am always cleaning up urine, you can't find a liner that works and the liners I have been using I have to tape in place. I am now looking again for a new litter box and I have had this one about 4 months. I have to my dog peep pads to keep the urine off the floor. I spend more time a week cleaning up the box and outside the box than I have will any other little box."
4,Clean step bouda dome litter box,I have two cats and they both use it. It does contain any smells if you use good litter. Litter falling outside the box is more contained but you need to vacuum the steps because they collect a lot. A previous reviewer mentioned that he had to create a false wall in the box right inside the opening in order to force the cats to walk down the stairs instead of jumping right out the opening. This spilled a lot of litter. I did this by cutting in half one of those flexible kitchen cutting mats and attached it with that gummy stuff you use to attach posters to walls. This has really helped to contain the litter on the stairs. I found you also need a rounded litter scooper. Square edged ones prevent you from cleaning around the edge of the box (since the box is rounded)if you don't use liners.
1,worst cat box ever!,"-The liners are not big enough for the box.-the odor filters are no help-the ad states there is a handle..but it does not firmly attach to the sides so you cant pick the bottom and top up with the handle..just the lid only...-the traditional cat box with handle and side attachements are much easier to empty.-stairs were a bonus, but not for all the yucky mess that goes with cleaning this huge unhelpful box."
2,Great at first but then came the Problems,"When I first got this litter box, I thought it was great. It is very spacious and the steps catch much of the litter from my cats' paws. However, I soon discovered a huge flaw with this litter box. Where the top meets the bottom, cat urine is accumulated. I clean the litter box every day and have had this problem often. I plan to give this litter box away or trash it."
1,"Not so much the product's fault, but Amazon's","The filter holder's clasp was broken on arrival, and the top and bottom half don't fit together securely enough (my dogs could easily pry them apart should they choose to and feast on kitty nuggets). I am not pleased. I would return this item, only I have a very busy life and schedule, and therefore do not have the time to trouble myself with re-packaging this item and sending it back to Amazon. I'm forced to purchase another litter box, which I'm sure Amazon is only too happy about. Thanks for nothing, Amazon."
1,to small,"i got this for my cat to help keep the house clean, but this new litter box was a problem because it was to small."
1,Shipping Cost is OBSCENE!,"I read the reviews and thought now this is what I need. I clicked to buy it and Amazon never took me to the page where shows the shipping costs before you confirm. I got the confirmation and shipping was $45!!!!!!!!!!!Thats more than the cost of the cat box, I'm sure not going to pay close to $90 for a plastic litter box!!!!!!!!!Time to go to the Pet Store"
1,Horrible!! Broken! Mishapen!,It took the seller more than 2 weeks to deliver the product to me and when I got it the item was broken and the lid did not fit properly whatsoever. I was very disappointed that it took longer than they had promised and was damaged upon arrival! And on top of that the damage was not damage that could have been caused from shipment. It had to be damaged prior to them packing it.I will never order from this seller again!
2,Still got litter on me floor...,"I'm pretty sure this thing backs up it's claim of keeping the smell down. Still got litter coming out though, and it doesn't seem to be much less. Also take note that the top does not latch on, so you cannot carry it by the handle with the base attached. I wish I had seen this one before: http://www.amazon.com/Omega-Paw-Self-Cleaning-Litter-Large/dp/B0002DK2DU/ref=pd_sbs_k_1 . I guess since the clean step doesn't seem to keep the litter down, which is what I bought it for, I wish it could clean itself. That said, the Booda Dome looks nice, and it's pretty nice and big for the boys. The price was good too."
3,litter on floor,The cats still seem to bring litter out on the floor still. Even with the steps. a little dissappointed in the product...
5,Keeps the Dogs Out!,The design of the cat box is wonderful. I have three dogs and they all would eat out of the cat box every chance they had. Since purchasing this cat box two weeks ago they have not been able to get into it. I love the slope design for the cat to walk down. It keeps all the litter inside the box that my cat would normally get on the floor. I highly recommend this for people that have problems with dogs getting into the cat box.
4,Best Cat Box I've Ever Had,"This is a great cat box. The first benefit is that my dog can't get in it. The second benefit is the odor control. I actually forgot to change it once, till the cats reminded me! The cats still get some litter on the floor from their feet, because one of them jumps out instead of taking the stairs. But we love it."
3,cheap cat box,"we have 3 cats and i thought this was be a good addition to the litterboxs.Cat was I wrong, I like the design but the top has no latches to hold it to the bottom.This makes it difficult to pickup the box and the cats knock the top off everday.I used velco strips in 4 places on the sides, works great, I can even pickup the boxwhen I clean it out."
4,Less smell and less mess,I got 3 cats and the old litter tray always very smelly and lots litter sand came out from the tray and even the urine liquid.Booda dome does much better job. It looks very funky and also did a very good job than the old fashion little tray.The lining joint of the two parts are so fit that no more urine leaks. And it does reduce the smell. Most of the sand trapped on the stairs area.One negative that it is quite large and quite difficult to wash it.I couldn't find it in Australia so I bought from amazon. The plastic mould bend a bit during shipping and couldn't mount the top and bottom part properly. But lucky this can be fit with the help of a hair dryer to heat up the plastic and soften it a bit to mount to fit again.
3,"Very bulky, still need a mat to catch litter","My hope for this litter box was that it would eliminate all of the little litter particles I step on with my bare feet every time I walk by the box. While it did eliminate the large piles that would come out of the sides from time to time, I find that a lot of litter still gets tracked out on to the floor. Do not buy this expecting to not need a mat right outside the entrance."
2,Not one size fits all,"I thought this product would prevent my cat from flinging litter all over my floor, so I purchased it. It worked great for a few weeks, until my cat started peeing on the inside of the dome : ( The urine would stream down the sides, go out of the dome, and then on to my floor; disgusting! I tried making sure the dome was on tight and pulling the litter bag up on the sides of the dome, but at best all I could do was get the urine to pool in the bag and then dump it into the litter box. The end result was I traded litter on my floor for urine. This box is not for my cat and thus I have retired it and resorted back to an open litter box and lots of vacuuming."
2,Not a good choice,"This is not a good box. It's hard to properly seal the top to the bottom, leading to frequent leaks. Results are messy. Definitely not worth it."
4,"So far, a pretty nice Litterbox!","Well, after 2 weeks so far so good with the new litter-box. My cat is kinda of finicky when it comes to litter-boxes, but he likes this one. I'll admit, the design could use some work. The top doesn't fit as snugly as I'd like, though the liner does adds some thickness to the seal around the edge so it fits a little tighter than without a liner in the box. Some users have noticed the top not fitting well also. Fortunately my cat isn't a sprayer when it comes to peeing so I don't have to worry about pee leaking out of the sides as some users have noted. I DO recommend using a liner as the shape of the litter pan being rounded could make it a pain to scoop. The stairs do help with catching litter, but I still have to use a litter mat to keep it from getting all over the floor. Overall I'd say 4/5 stars. Give it a try!"
3,Cat box,"While this cat box may work for many, it did not work for us. We have 2 20 year old cats. One of which has rear end issues so we thought that having the steps would help him get in and out of the cat box instead of trying to get over the edge of a regular car box. Unfortunately this did not work for one of our cats. He won't use the steps to get into the box so he pees on the steps. I suggest this type of cat box would be great for kittens or young cats."
4,best,"i love this cat box! it keeps everything covered and smelling fresh with the charcoal filter. however, my only problem with this is that the liner keeps coming out of the one clasp after my cat uses it so i have to continue to adjust it every now and again. overall though, i am highly satisfied with my purchase!"
4,booda litter box,"We have found this product great. Looks great , easy to clean , and the cats and kittenslove it.Sharon"
2,disappointing quality,"I have had wonderful past experiences with Booda boxes, but this one came without the filters or dome inserts. I called the vendor and they kindly sent a new one. The new one's dome split and cracked within 5 days. I hardly believe it is the same product I've had in the past. What has happened to quality control?"
1,"Booda Dome Clearstep Cat Box, Iris","This is a handsome looking litter box and the color is very nice.It just does not work for me. It is too hard to keep the dome top on the base. My cats were just curious and would put their nose on it or rub by it and the top would pop off. They were scared to get in it. Also, it is entirely too small inside for my large cat. The stairs you see on the outside are the same size inside too taking up about half the space. In the base there is a half moon shaped indention for the litter liner and the litter. Just very hard to manage. I liked the concept."
2,"Big, but not big enough","I was searching for a rather large covered box as my cat is about 18 lbs, and very long, and was basically barely getting into a traditional, covered box and then letting loose... all over the floor in front of the box. I thought this one would keep her from having any rear area exposed since she's supposed to walk up the stairs and get situated. Well, she got all four paws in the litter, but still managed to do both her businesses down the stairs. I've gone back to an open box, but found one at a container store with 8"" high sides so she can't miss. Sorry Booda, I really wanted to love you. You looked so cool!"
2,More messes,"I bought the booda dome in hopes that it would solve my cat's tendency to pee on the side of every litter box she encounters. I thought that it would be an easy fix since there are really no corners to pee in. I was wrong, and instead of helping me solve messy issues, the booda dome made them worse. Not only can you not put bags in this thing, my cat found it hilarious to not even use the stairs. Instead, she would leap from the inside, over the stairs, and drag the litter everywhere. I guess this litter box design depends on what type of cat you have."
3,"Functional, But Doesn't Prevent Tracking.","I bought this litter box hoping to solve the issue of my spastic cat flinging litter 20 feet as he flees from the box. While this box is functional, it doesn't stop the tracking at ALL. In fact, I might argue that it's slightly worse than a standard box- the steps collect litter, which is always visible, and makes it easier for the cats to knock litter out. However, the filters are a nice touch if odor is your main issue."
4,Great for multicat homes,"Love it. I have a kitten who lives to "" play"" in the litter box and this keeps him from throwing it everywhere. Large enough for multicat homes. The reason it did not get 5 stars is that the inside corners and bottom are curved, it looks like a giant bean, and sometimes it's hard to get clumps out without them breaking apart."
3,Pretty alright,"It controls smells pretty well except if you are in front of the door(opening) but from the side they are as fragrant, which works for my setup. the steps do stop SOME litter definately not all of it and the litter that collects on the step area is hard to remove without spilling it on the floor which defeats the prupose of the steps in the first place. The top is easy to remove and reposition when sccoping. BOTTOM LINE;if you want an attractive looking, somewhat smell reducing litter box this is the one!"
1,not happy,"I purchased 2 of these - one came without the filter and there was no way to contact the seller on amazon - and one of my cats HATED the dome and decided to urinate outside the box ,which has never happened before."
3,"great, in theory","I REALLY wanted to like this litter box. I bought it thinking that it would keep the dog out. It might have done so, if only my cats would go in it. Despite the visually large size of this box, the inner cavity is actually quite small and narrow, compared to our old box, the Large PetMate box. The day after I got the Booda Cleanstep box, my standard-sized tabby peed on the couch (first time ever), so I went to investigate the box and see if it had been used. I lifted the lid and the cat immediately ran to it to do her business. Even with the lid OFF it was difficult for her to turn around properly. As for other people's complaints: yes, the box is made of a very flexible plastic, making it a bit tricky to get the top to fit snugly onto the bottom. The lid does NOT latch onto the bottom; to move the box you'll have to bend down and embrace the whole thing (yum)."
4,Cat igloo,"We have this beautiful stray that has ""adopted"" us so with the changing weather I am using it for a place for her to go in & sleep. I have a blanket, then covered the top of it with a heavy quilt that insulates it. She seems to love it. I can't bring her in as we have 3 dogs & the oldest 2 would try to hurt her, so I feed her, give her lots of love on the porch. So it's not a kitty dome but a kitty home ;-) lol"
2,"Does not work for the ""high peers""","I bought this litter pan in the high hopes that it would help my 2 cats not track and fling litter all over the place. They are used to covered boxes; that is not the problem. My big, 19-lb. (not fat, just big) cat is a ""high peer."" The bottom part of the box is not very high, and so when he pees, not crouching enough, the pee goes sideways right at the crack between the top and the bottom and urine collects there. This defeats the purpose of my having bought this fairly expensive box. If you have smaller cats who crouch when they pee, it's fine for you. If not, beware."
2,Cat urine...cat urine everywhere,"I've been using the Booda Dome Cleanstep Cat box for about two years. At first I loved this litterbox. The stairs do an excellent job of trapping litter and the round shape makes the box easier to clean. Odor is well controlled too. However, the quality is lacking. Within a few months I noticed the lid would not go on firmly without a lot of jostling. At this point it essentially is not held in place firmly at all. Since one of my cats is very vigorous with his post-business scratching (seriously, he goes to town in there) the lid becomes lose after one use. This means having to constantly check throughout the day that the lid is on securely. Came home today and the lid had completely slid off and there was cat urine everywhere - on the wall behing the box, on the floor, underneath the box. Gross. Into the garbage it goes.In summary: the Booda is a great idea, but it desperately needs a locking lid. As is, it becomes unusable with time. Do not recommend."
2,Litter box dissapointment,"I loved this box at first, but, there urine keeps going over on to the stairsand I have a big clean up. I've gone though a huge amount of paper towels cleaningup the urine on the steps. Finally got another box."
1,I hate this litter box.,"We thought this litter box would be great -- that the staircase would take any excess litter off of the cat's paws before they excited. That didn't really work out, plus I found it very cumbersome to change the litter. the box is deep, the litter container is kidney shaped and there ar eno angles to use as pouring spouts. I had to literally scoop out all of the litter. Also, for some reason my cats would take to urinating on the stairwell -- yuck! They're well-trained cats and have never peed innapropriately prior to this. Thsi seemed like a good box in theory, but we've gotten rid of it after only about a month, so now it just seems like a waste of money."
2,Mom to cats,"I read about this litter box and did my research for months before I finally purchased it. I was thrilled by the reviews stating that is controlled the smell, and that it controlled the spill of litter onto the floor. Boy were they wrong....I dont know what those people are doing so differently....but I still have a pile of litter on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. You can still smell everything, and I have to clean it twice as much, because the cats have a limited area to enter the box, and otherwise they would be stepping on poop everytime they got in. I was going to purchase another of the same box if I liked the performance of this one, but I doubt I will now. Other than looking cool, its nothing special. The liners that fit it also do not stay in the hook and rip easily."
1,Noida Dome litter box,"We purchased this to keep the cats from urinating over the back, now they urinate over the middle and the steps are constantly filled with urine. It is a must clean every day. Needless to say, I am replacing it. I have tried just about every litter box made. Finally have decided to just use one that has a very high back."
3,"SO hoped I would like this, but.....","First, like the others stated, this litterbox is HUGE. Do not get it if you don't have adequate room, as it takes up a ton of space.My cat is the type that climbs in the litterbox, hangs her behind over the side and urinates on the floor. My vet suggested the Booda Box, as that is the one she uses for her 5 cats. Bought it with high hopes....Well, my cat doesn't pee in the litterbox area of this box, she does her business ON THE STAIRS. So I am constantly cleaning the puddle that accumulates at the base of the stairs.Based on what my vet told me, this litterbox works wonders - again, she has *5* cats that use ONE litterbox, the Booda Box being it. I have ONE cat, THREE litterboxes, and she can't seem to urinate INSIDE of any of the three.... :("
3,Ehh,"First off it comes in a joke of a package... Just a cardboard box with paper wrapped around the litter box... Cheap plastic... I don't understand why they thought the filter idea would work (just wanting you to buy more bs).. And beside that, i had a design flaw with what holds the filter on... The litter box IS HUGE!!!! Now some positive Comments, It keeps litter from getting thrown all over the floor... It has a nice look to it; more stylish than a standard box ... It helps keep the stench down... (JUST DON'T WASTE MONEY ON EXTRA FILTERS AND BAGS!!!) Overall I'm happy i bought it... cost 28$ buying it from AMAZON.com rather than 40$ at pet supermarket"
3,"big, but not to big, but still smelly","ill keep this short.have 2 cats that average 20lbs. they fit fine! thought the filter system would really keep down the smell since we have to keep this on our main level of our house. but still a bit smelly.pretty sturdy, could use latches to hold down top, sometimes cats want to rub on it and slightly knocks the top off.i was harsh with a 3 star but i just couldnt bring my self to a 4 due to the smell with the filters.btw the purple was cool tho :)"
5,"Litter, Mess & (most of) the Smell Stays Inside!",Nice upgrade from previous covered box. Two kittens took to it immediately.Pros:Hardly any litter escapesNo more kicking litter out of the boxNo more hanging butts partially out of the box and making a messMost of the smell stays in the boxEverything is hidden from viewNo more jumping on top and knocking the scoop off*Amazon included the best cat toy: They love to stalk and play with the brown paper used for packaging.Cons:A waft of smell still escapes the box immediately after use (box is 6-8 feet away)Must clean box 1-2 times per day to keep from smelling at all with two kittens (better than previous covered box)General:No problem scooping (use cheap store brand scooper)No change in sound
2,Massive,"This litter box is massive- it's VERY big. It does make things quieter, but not quite silent. I still hear the cats scratching the litter, and its too big to put in the restroom behind the toilet. I'm not loving it. I would return if it was possible. Carefully read the dimensions and make sure you have a spot big enough for it. I cannot over emphasize enough how big this is."
4,the cat box,The cat box is Great helps with the smell and tracking litter out of the box. However it is not all that dog proof it took my dog sometime but he did get it bit I still love it...
1,"Not good for ""standing up"" while they go!","This box didn't work well for my cat who, strangely enough, likes to remaining fairly upright while he pees. The problem is that there is no interior wall - the little entrance stair leads into the box but the cat doesn't really have to step around a corner. Hence, my big boy proceeded to go right over the staircase edge (while in the box), and the urine drained right down the stairs. Very luckily for me, there was sort of a catchment-effect at the bottom and most of the urine remained pooled up on the last stair, but it was a very close call and some did leak over.If your cat reliably squats way down this may well be good, but know how your cat goes before you buy!"
4,I like it,I hope the cats like it. Only one cat decided to use it but the others seem to not like the idea that they can't see the outside while they poop. Is like they want to be aware of their surrounding in order to poop peacefully
3,It was ok,The lid came with a crack on the top and was also bent. I had to bend it back out to fit the bottom piece.
1,Creates a pee waterfall!,"I love innovative litter boxes and decided to try this fun igloo shaped box.The stairs were cute. Unfortunately, there isn't much room on the inside for cat business and if you have a large cat, it will hang its hiney over the edge onto the stairs and produce a pee waterfall.I don't recommend this at all!"
1,Big Mistake,"We had high hopes for this box when we got it, but it was a big disappointment. It actually made the tracking problem worse. The litter would pile up on the steps and get kicked out onto the floor in big batches. There was no good way to get it off the steps and back into the box. It leaked all the time, dribbling onto the floor. The curved shape looked nice but made it more difficult to scoop, especially with the clumping litter."
2,"Missing parts, Top and bottom different colors","Package arrived on time. Top color is white, bottom is a yellow cream color. Missing the part that snaps inside to the lid to hold the filter. RETURNED."
3,"Looks Great, But Impractical","My cats do enjoy it, which I guess is the main point; it looks great and the steps do in fact help with the grit cats can track everywhere.However, it is hard to line up correctly (sometimes my cats urinate on the inside of the walls and it leaks out the sides) and it takes 2 of us to empty it properly, even with the bags. I've never had a cat box that was so ridiculous to empty, and it is the most dreaded task now thanks to the shape. I'm probably going to give this thing a little more time before I get fed up and buy one that's easy to clean."
2,I wish I would have done more research,"This is a nice litter box, however the biggest flaw is that there is no way to secure a bag inside without having part of the bag exposed to the cats to claw at. Someone needs to invent a cat box liner that is claw proof! There needs to be some way to have the bag go over the entire box so that it is not easy to rip it. Also the lid does not go back on easily - sometimes you have to try several times before it lines up with the bottom. It's an ok buy, but not as great as it has been made out as."
1,this is not right riping people off,I ordered this iteam because i was have problem with a dog going in the litter box. This iteam is JUNK .also it was not here when i was told it would have been. it didnt come in the orginal box like they do in the stores. there are scrathes all over the box and top looks like it has been used and sent back and im very unhappy with this order.
5,Booda Dome Cat Litter Box is the BEST EVER,"This is by far the best cat box ever. The cats are forced to take the ramp up, so the don't make nearly as much of a mess as with a standard cat box. The clean-up is nice for me too, because the top lifts right off with a nice handle. There are no straps or clamps, so the lid just lifts right off. Simple and Easy. The box holds alot of litter too. I have 2 cats and it's plenty of room for them.All other cat boxes are the same price or more for that bigger size. So, if you're into easy cleanup and free shipping...jump at this offer. I'm so glad my daughter has 2 of these, b/c I would have never seen the Booda Dome otherwise."
3,Booda Dont,Great idea for a little box but the lid does not fit into place like it should... Just kind of balances on the bottom half.
2,lid problems,lid wouldn't stay on.. returned without using.. otherwise ok.. also quite large.. so make sure you have plenty of room./
2,litter pan,holder for filter does not stay closed only small plastic clip. Not well made. looked like thin plastic. top does not clip to bottom. Will be returning this item.
1,"if you can't ship it , then don't sell it","I was sent a e-mail 3 or 4 day's later that it can't be shipped because it was to expensive. I may have recieved a refund , but that's not what I wanted. If you list it, ship it."
2,From an engineering standpoint,"I gave this litter box 1 star because it functions as a litter box. I gave it one more star because it is more pleasing to the eye than most litter boxes. But, from an engineering stand point:1. Why didn't they make this square? It is more difficult to get the litter scooped than from a traditional rectangular litter box. I also have never been able to get the lid completely on there properly; it just kind of rests in a near proper position.2. There should be a divider that goes up to the lid that actually forces that cats to use the stairs instead of just hopping over. My cats do seem to use the stairs and they serve their purpose, but I've seen other ones that don't.Bottom line, I would't spend my money on this again until they fix these problems. The good things don't outway the frustrating ones."
2,Dont pay Extra For The Stairs,Meh. The cats don't use the stairs - they both just jump over the side wall into the litter. They kick litter onto the stairs then pee on the stairs which are a pain to clean. I moved recently and just threw this litter box out - we'll have a fresh start with something more basic. Plusses though - it is HUGE - plenty of room for my big ol Ragdoll kitty.
2,poor design,I have had this product now for 4 months and I find it worse than the traditional style. Maybe my two cats make more of a mess than others but this thing needs constant cleaning. Also with normal litter scoops you can't get to everything in the rounded corners. The steps save most litter from the floor but some still gets out and they have litter on them constantly. I don't see where this is any better than products that cost 1/2 the price.
1,Totally dysfunctional for my cats,"I have been totally dissatisfied with this product. I've only had it for a few weeks and have already ordered a different litter box. The top is not latched to the bottom so: (1) You cannot move the whole box from one place to another; (2) Urine leaks out onto the floor through the connection between top & bottom. I constantly have to clean the floor around the Booda and the sides of the dome. It is difficult to scoop inside because of the round walls and is cumbersome to clean period.My male cat digs, so the liners are useless, and I suspect that he's the one who sprays the wall (ergo the leaking urine). My female cat jumps over the steps to get out of the dome, so the stairs do no good to knock off litter.All-in-all, this has been a very dissappointing product."
2,Just as stinky and messy as a regular litter box...,"We bought this a couple of months ago, and can see no significant advantage over a regular litter box. When the cat does #2, the whole house still fills with the putrid stench of cat poop every bit as much as with regular litter box. There is a carbon filter for the top vent, but that doesnt help with the stench escaping from the front door. The only slight advantage is that when the cat covers his poop, he doesnt sling litter out onto the floor (unless the door happens to be right behind him)."
2,"Could be improved, wouldn't buy again","I have two of these for my two cats - I liked the fact that it is a covered box. However, like a previous reviewer said, it needs to latch down. The entrance is awkward, and litter does accumulate there. I have NOT noticed any less litter being tracked around the house. If you intend to buy this one to cut down on tracking, keep looking!"
3,*Looks* Better than it works,"Unfortunately this litter box is much more visually appealing than anything else. I think I enjoyed it more than the cat, she always jumped into the box (avoiding the stairs completely) and then ripped the heck out of the dome liners, scratching them until they ripped, the liner sides hang over the stairway so she would try to bury the bag in the litter, causing a big mess and the stairs would always be covered it litter by the time she was done.I think the idea of the box is smart but it just needs some tweaking, maybe if the stairs led right to the litter instead of sitting beside it, because I dont think cats really know to come out and go down and around to exit, as she would just jump out of the box from the litter, flinging litter bits as she went! Its funny but not at all tidy or practical."
1,Urine runs out the lip of the lid,"Bought 2 boodas - have 4 cats which are very clean so usage is not the problem. The lip (for lack of better term) of the lid is too low so unless your cats hug the litter, the pee will run out of the lip. The entire rim needs to be wiped off daily and often the floor and edges of bottom box. Yuck. Bottom needs to be MUCH deeper."
1,Used to be a better product!,"I had this litter box several years ago and it worked great. Since I was having trouble with my two labs looking for extra treats, I thought I would buy this again and am throwing the sucker out! I have pee on the stairs constantly and it leaks where the top and bottom join together. It seems much more shallow in the pan portion than I remember, although the size seems comparable to the other one I had. I have it under an open counter and my dogs can't seem to get into it, but I am going back to the rectangle covered box and have the other rectangle covered box face to face with each other and I think my dogs can't get into it. I have had the Booda for about six weeks and I am so tired of cleaning up the pee - it's making me crazy!"
2,so-so,"I was really excited about this litter box. The pros are: The color is very nice, my cat likes the stairs and it seems to keep control of the litter. The cons are- The top doesn't fit snug. I don't know if mine just has a defect or what, but it won't clip on correctly. Also, My filter won't attach the top correctly. If these were fixed, it would be a great litter box. I thought about returning it, but I will just use it for now and purchase a different brand litter box soon."
1,give this a pass,"I've had this for a few months, and I'll be getting rid of it soon. It does not keep litter from getting everywhere, and cat spray leaks out of the edges and gets on the floor. It takes up a ton of space, is messier than any other litter box I've tried, and even the three rugs I keep around it aren't enough to contain spills and stray litter. Give something else a try. This is more of a headache than is even worth dealing with."
4,Great Litter Box,Great litter box. Clean-up is easy & my cats love it. The design also seems to keep the younger one from bothering the older one while she's using the litter box (which used to be a big problem). It does take up a lot of space but it's worth it. Color is kind of hideous in person but we hide ours in a closet so it's not a big deal.
4,Really Great Litter Box,"I have a 3 month old kitten who we started on with this box. She really loves that it is covered and hasn't had one mistake (knock on wood). The litter does stay on the stairs, but that is what it is supposed to do. I have to do less vacuuming than with previous cats and previous litter boxes. It keeps the smell contained as well, which is good for our apartment. My only concern is that the litter liners do not seem to work that well. I can never get them to fit. Overall, though, a good purchase."
1,Cat pees on stairs,I have 2 cats. One keeps peeing on the stairs . We returned this box after having this happen several times in a week.
2,Not a good option for an active or female cat,"This box has many benefits, but the drawbacks outweigh them by far with my frisky 8-month-old little girl.The amount of litter that is tracked out is minimal, and the dome and filter work well for reducing odors. This litter box definitely delivers on both of these issues.However, my little kitty has successfully knocked off the lid numerous times. There is no way to latch the lid to the bottom, and unfortunately the lid shifts often. If you combine the shaky lid with a female cat, you get urine leaking through the crack and on the floor. Not pleasant or desired. Despite the unique and useful design of this product, I would not recommend it."
3,"Good for Smell, Not for Scooping","I had this litter box for about 6 months when I finally gave up on it. It works well for hiding odors and for keeping litter in the box not on the floor, but the scooping was impossible. I tried a couple of different scoopers but because the litter box has no edges, it was very difficult to scoop in the corners. I went back to a square one."
1,Doesn't do what it supposed to do!,"Thought that this litter box would be great for our two cats but it's NOT! First of all the cover does not stay on too well and it is always is shifting. It is hard to clean out by wash out the box since it is so bulky and it tends to get stuck on the sides and you have to keep rinsing the box over and over to get the litter out (if you do not have to liners that fit this box size). In terms of order control, it works to an extend, defiantly keeps cat poo out of sight, but the cats still drag out the litter on to the floor and on steps of the cat box!!! With all being said it is Not a great product, I would not recommend it."
4,Kitty heaven,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter's kitty. He absolutely loves it & so does my daughter. The kitty enjoys the privacy & it keeps his area clean so my daughter is happy too!
4,Large enough for my extra large cat,"I purchased this hoping it would be big enough for my 17+# cat. The ""large"" litter box I had when he was a kitten was outgrown and he preferred just an open pan out in the laundry room. This is big enough for him to get in and out of easily and there is much less mess to sweep up. A few pebbles of litter per week is a lot better than daily sweeping up of excess from their feet. The liners are large enough but I do wish they were more of a custom fit for the shape. I saw the comments on the liners that fit this, I didn't think they were too thin but they get a little loose before the end of the week although they haven't ripped or shredded them yet and both my cats (the other is normal size) have all of their claws. I would recommend this especially if you have a hefty size cat. Also, order extra liners now if you purchase this."
3,Used it for a while but will be switching to a new box,"I thought this box would be great because of the ramp that is supposed to catch the litter as they walk out. Instead, the litter gets tracked all over the stairs and out of the box. Another appeal of the box was that the main litter area was away from the entrance and I thought my dog may not be able to reach the ""scooby snacks."" Wrong again...the dog can still reach in and eat the poop. Gross!So if you are thinking of buying this box for either of those reasons, keep searching."
2,"Great idea, but it didn't work for our kitty","This box is a great idea, as our 16-year-old cat can't jump much anymore and was having trouble getting in and out of other boxes. But this box didn't work for her, mainly because she apparently thought that merely standing in the litter part of the box was sufficient. I won't get graphic--you can get the idea--liquids follow gravity."
3,Booda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box,"Our cat likes this domed litter box very much. And the litter isn't tracked all over the floor after she goes in. It's easy to clean-up and she can have her ""privacy"" while inside it."
3,Not for high risers,This litterbox is certainly of good size and the steps work as promised in reducing the amount of litter tracked out of the box. However! If you have a cat that likes to back his tushie to the wall and pee standing up this igloo will not work! Unless you're willing to duct tape the top to the bottom your kitty's pee will leak out the side and conveniently pool underneath. If the sides of this box were higher it would have been perfect but as it this beaut is bound for the local shelter.
1,Not useful for intended purpose.,This litter box has numerous major design flaws. First it's shape which makes it hard to place in an out of the way spot and nearly impossible to clean. I was so disappointed the first time I changed the litter. It was a HUGE mess. The actual litter area is so small that our larger cat ends up messing on the steps. Litter is still tracked out of the box as the special steps quickly fill with litter and are difficult to clean without taking out the vacuum everyday. The liner bags are useless as the cats quickly shred them. On my unit the door to area that holds the carbon filter doesn't stay shut. When it falls open it scares my cat and he tears out of the box to do his business elsewhere. Don't bother buying this box. It's a waste of time and money.
2,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda and then it might still be used!","I set the liter pan up the way the instructions said, put some clean liter, and a little dirty liter in it. Within a day my 20 pound cat was using it and she had all the room she needed. About a week into her using it I was able to remove the smaller pan she had outgrown, but then it happened. The cat was in her pan and the housing that hold the filter dropped down right on her. The latch is not designed well and if I had taped the latch or just removed the filter unit she would still be using the Booda but the cat has not set foot near it since ""it attacked her"". Make sure if you buy this that you triple check the plastic latch or you will just have a useless decoration in your house/"
2,Not quite right...,"The Booda Dome worked well with cutting down the amount of litter tracking outside the box. However, my two cats (one 10 lbs, the other 15 lbs) did not have enough space inside to ""take care of business"" within the litter area. One or both kept peeing on the steps. I got tired of cleaning that up and dealing with the urine smell (even with the filter!)."
1,Dirty steps and pee gets through seam under cover,"I've had this box for a while now and plan to replace it very soon. It's a huge chore to keep clean. The steps are hard to clean, and my cat has a tendency to cover them with litter, poop, and pee. But worst of all, my cat pees on the wall above the seam between the cover and the tray and the pee gets out of the box and ends up on the floor. It would have been smart for the designers to engineer a lid/pan junction that didn't allow liquids to pass through... but they didn't do this! I've been putting pee pads (i.e., dog training pads) under the box to catch the escaping pee. Those pads are expensive. I've grown to hate this box."
1,More trouble than it's worth!,"This ""box"" is very hard to clean. The fact that there are no corners means that getting all the clumps out of the narrower bends is very difficult. Also, bigger cats (like mine) will miss the litter portion and hit the stairs instead - causing an even bigger clean up job. It looks cool but I threw mine away after two weeks."
4,Great product for the most part,"I got an extremely fat cat. Love him, but he is a chuncker and when he goes in regular litter boxes he will get inside and his butt will hang over the edge and hence....poop gets everywhere and it isn't a fun thing. I got another enclosed litter box but he got stuck in the entrance hole a few times and so I got this one, it is relatively high and large so we are all happy (cat and I and my husband who I refer to litter box duty) It contains the smell pretty well, I feel like the ""filter"" is useless and doesn't work, I stuck a car feshner in the same spot that works better then any filter. And my biggest con is the litter box bags are expensive. I ended up using plain old garbage bags but they rip easily. Overall, I like it, my cat likes it, the smell is contained and I am a happy camper."
2,Just another box,"I fell for all the reviews I read on the many websites I checked this litter box out at, but honestly, it's just another litter box. The steps LOOK like they should help, but because of the open design under the cover, my cats easily step from the litter box portion to the very bottom of the steps, avoiding the majority of the steps to get out of it.I will admit that it is exceptionally good at keeping in odor, but that is about the only thing I like about it. The size is huge, and for my small apartment, I wish I had chosen something else. At the time I was more focused on keeping litter tracking to a minimum, but now that I still have to sweep the living room every time I wake up (with no other area I'm allowed to put it in this apartment), I wish I had a smaller box just so I could hide it under a hutch of some sort."
3,"neat cat box, but dome lid was cracked","Our two cats took to this right away. It is a unique design that I like, but the dome of the one I got was cracked at the top in shipping. Definitely, too much trouble to send back because of the size so I kept it anyway, but because of the cracks, we can't use the filter at the top which is really a nice feature."
2,Not what I expected,my cat and I are very disapointed in this item. i have been searching high and low for a litter box that would control the amount of litter that makes it on to the floor. After reading all of the excellent reviews on this prodcut i was very excited to try it out. My first and formost problem is that the two pecies do not lock together. My cat is very spry and knocks around in his boxthe dome has come off twicenow. My seccond issue is that for as big as the picture made it out ot be I dont think that the litter box part where the litter goes is really all that big. My 3rd and most triffling problem is that it does not do the job of keeping the litter off of the floor. After setting it up day one same amount of litter on the floor if not a little more.I can say i am extremly disapointed. If it wasnt so big and such a hassel to get it all back in a box i would return it.
3,Private Palace,I recently bought the Booda Dome cat box because I have an older cat who find climbing the stairs into the cat box a little easier and with 6 cats they like to have privacy in the box so the stairs and lid of the Booda dome really provide for that. My only issue is that when I received my item the plastic clip that keeps the filter in place was busted. I tried taping it up but it didn't work and a brand new filter was crapped on. Maybe if I would have used duct tape it would have stayed in place. I just didn't want to return the whole thing just because of a broken clip. So if you buy this item pay attention to that. Otherwise it's a good product.
2,Just not for us...,"I have a family of 3 cats. One is older, and two younger ones. The older one has a problem with other boxes, she doesn't put her butt in all the way, and tends to pee over the edge, leaving a mess, I thought this would force her to climb in... but turns out she doesn't like covered cat boxes so she's decided that peeing on the steps is sufficient. Lol.Anyways, the two younger ones have claws, and like to scrape the catbox obsessively to cover when finished, so I used this without the liners and its somewhat difficult to scoop the rounded inside ""corners"" clean if someone pees too close to the edge.This would be great if you don't have a cat who minds covered boxes, or liners! Mine are just ""special"" ;)*** I must say it really did help minimize the litter on the floor!!!"
2,"Nice cat box, but filter doesn't fit in anywhere","This cat box is a great idea, and I would like it quite a bit, but for the following caveat. I would have given this item 5 stars if there were some way to actually use the filter that came with it.There's a hole in the top of the box near the handle which looks as if it is designed for another piece of plastic or something to fit into it, possibly to hold the filter. There was no smaller piece included in the shipment, however, so the filter is useless and the box only gets 2 stars instead of five.Hey Amazon, this box STINKS the way it is!!!This item is far too expensive (for a cat box) to be either: a) designed poorly, or b) shipped incompletely."
1,Cats won't even go inside it.,"In theory a great idea. I thought my girls would like the privacy of the booda dome, but they won't even go inside it. May be because one small bump (from inside or out) and the dome comes off. The dome is really hard to put on to the base. Doesn't quite seem to fit. And though the box in total is really large and takes up a huge amount of room in my house, the area for the cat to use, is quite small and cramped."
3,Decent Litter Box,"The litter box works fine as a litter box, however my cat has figured out that she can simply jump over the stairs, eliminating the benefit of removing the litter from her paws."
2,So So Litter Box,"This is a HUGE box, way bigger than I need and would actually be a much nicer kitty condo if you put blankets or apillow in it instead of litter for about 5 small to medium sized cats to sleep in! The complaint I have is that the top does not latch the way it should, so it just lifts off and it's a pain to put on so it stays in the groove. You still need a mat under it or in front of the doorway to keep litter off the floor. Also Amazon was to have shipped this 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime and they failed to do so....it arrived ground service a week later. Not good service!"
1,Does not deliver as hoped,This unit is too small for large cats and my cats still track just as much litter from it as the regular Booda Dome.
2,Ineffective,"This product promises that it will reduce tracked litter and prevent dogs from grabbing poo snacks. Yes, the stairs do trap some litter but I'm still sweeping litter every day. My bichon, who is 23 pounds, can fit half his body in there and go to town on the poo snacks. Then he leaves left over poo snacks around the house and sometimes in my bed. I will order a new litter box ASAP, probably a top-entry one."
1,Not Ideal For Male Cats,"While this may be the greatest thing known to humans for some, I only used this produce for two weeks before donating it to charity. Every two days, one (if not both) of my cats would urinate down the built in stairs which became nightmarish after the first couple of times since the only way to clean the stairs was to essentially dump the litter completely out into some sort of holding tank (but where??). Female cats I don't think would have this problem, but my two bad ones made having this product not worth the trouble."
4,"Brenda is underrated, but absolutely amazing!!","I sampled some of the tracks and I was so in love with the way she created her music that I rightfully supported her work by purchasing several tracks from this album. One track that I really love is ""Hello People"", which has kind of a 70s/80s pop sound to it, but still it has me dancing and singing it over and over again. ""Two Eyes"" was another well done track. There are a few more gems on this album and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who can appreciate the kind of artist Brenda Russell truly is. The fact that this album came out a year before I was born, goes to show I can appreciate music that has lived longer than I have, LOL. Thank you Amazon for making this album available in mp3 format. Brenda Russell is amazing."
1,Not biblically accurate,"I really wanted to like this film. I expected being from Voice of the Martyrs that it would be accurate. However, we could only watch about 15 minutes before we got completely disgusted with it. The Bible's account of Christ is sufficient--you do not need to add in ""extra"" details to make it more entertaining (for adults or children). This film also took alot of creative license, and in doing so, inaccurately portrayed Scripture. (and this is only from the 1st 15 minutes or so) We only want our children to see accurate portrayals of Scripture. I dare you to watch this with your Bible in your lap and compare what you see to what is in Scripture."
4,personal review,"Ordered this recording for my wife as a gift. She really has enjoyed it. Not my kind of music , but as I said she ejoys it."
2,cornball in these days,Slim is famous for a voice to do the Indian Love Call . However most modern Indian maids not responding.
5,What it it to be Me! An Asperger Kid Book,"I bought this book for my 8-year-old Aspergian grandson. Upon receiving it, he immediately sat down and read it cover to cover. He identified traits that he knows he has and realized others that he had not been pinpointed. He now keeps the book on his nightstand, and reads portions of it daily. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a child or grandchild who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome."
1,Not worth the $5!!!,"If you are a massage therapist looking for GOOD marketing advice for your business, DO NOT buy this book! The information contained in the 14 pages of this book can be found on most internet sites for FREE!!! I know, because I've downloaded 90% of what the author has written. I'm extremely disappointed. Just providing a list of ""what to do"" does nothing...what we need is someone to teach us ""how"" to do it!! A total waste of $5!!! But then, you get what you pay for."
3,bad printing makes 1st movement unreadable,"I don't what gremlin invaded the printing plant, but the first signature is overinked or overprinted in such a way that pages appear almost transparent, so that runs of eighth notes on a verso appear on the recto and vice versa. It's only the first sig, so you get used to it, but it's a serious defect and presumably would make for some tough orchestral harmonies if you actually had to play it this way."
1,the author is a bias!,"this book is based on the author's own personal opinion on drugs. He had stated repeatly on his book that all drugs should be legalize, and available to public, most illegal drugs are much effective than prescription drugs. Also, he critized numerous drug companies especially the way they market their drugs to the public (doctors). HELLO!? drugs company is no different than any other corporations-they need to make profits too. Basically, he is a bias."
3,Review of Gourevich's Rousseau II,"The translation of this work is great, but its about the only redeeming feature of this work. The introduction really only addresses the Social Contract, and the editor didn't use footnotes to supplement those of Rousseau. I would have liked to see more scholarship in this work; it's just the reader and Rousseau, which can be uncomfortable, because he isn't a very friendly author. Also, I hate the covers on these Cambridge paperbacks; they're as stubborn as children."
3,Pretty Good,"This CD is alright, But it doesn't seem to have the impact of previous works by Chuck Loeb. The title track Presence isn't what I expected.I would strongly suggest intense listening a few times."
4,Great sound!,"I think this latest cd from Chuck Loeb include a smoth and very well sounded list of tracks. He has a great taste for wonderful sound and production. The old Steely Dan song ""Rikki don't lose that number"" is great. I have listened several times on the cd and it's great for background music as well. It's not his best cd, but it's worth buying it."
5,Awesome cd,"Chuck Loeb,s new Presence is awesome I give it 9 stars over all. He just keeps getting better & better on each cd he puts out.George Bretzlaff"
2,Presently presenting few presents,"2 1/2Much of the smoothed-out guitar work on display here comes across d.o.a. from the typical soulless tempos which guides so much of the waiting-room side of this genre, though Loeb is keen to insert a few numbers with far more vibrancy and compositional lure so as to attract a few extra listeners outside the smooth jazz spectrum as well."
4,Kitchen Microwave Shelf is Classy and Convenient!,"I have really enjoyed having this shelf in my kitchen. The outlets make it very very nice. My only complaint is that the screws are constantly coming loose and having to be re-tightened. It wouldn't be a big deal except that I have 3 small children and having a rickety shelf that tilts from side to side is not great. It has never even almost fallen over, but it makes a mommy a little nervous. I haven't put anything on the screws to make them stay or anything like that and that would be easily done. Overall this is a wonderful, thoughtfully made, useful product that I would recommend."
3,A real challenge to assemble,"I am somewhat disabled, and two ladies came to help put the thing together. One puts computers together and the other used to put houses together, so you'd think the three of us could do it, but no. Finally, a neighbor passing by heard the wails of three weeping women, came in, looked at what we'd done, and finished up the project in no time: about an hour.Furthermore, the power strip for this microwave cart is not suitable for an appliance requiring a ground wire."
1,Arrived damaged in multipel places,"For what I paid to ship 2 of these units (over $80), one would think they would take care of the product during shipping. The delivery person dropped them onto a stair leading to my stoop causing damage to some of the shelves. However, poor treatment of the items is not just a problem with the way overpriced delivery service they use. The units were each double boxed and on one unit, the inner box was all ripped up in one area, so I know they were carelessly tossed around before final packaging for shipping. In addition to damage to several of the shelves, many of the little mounting screw hole tabs were bent and one even missing. The drawer assembly instructions are not detailed enough and the screws just pulled right out of the holes in the frame anyway. I would return them if it wasn't a giant pain. So for now I have these rickety carts in use. I do not recommend this product at all."
3,Microwave Cart Review,"The design of the cart was good - it is an excellent space saver. However, it was difficult to put together - the pre-drilled holes for the screws were difficult to get the screws into. A power screw driver might have worked better but I could not get all screws tight and flush utilizing a manual screw driver."
5,White Kitchen Cart with power strip,After it was put together this has been great! It definitely is not as easy as it is made out to be to be put together and I ended up needing a power drill but once all was said and done it works fantastically! I absolutely love it!
4,This book has helped SO MUCH!,"Yes, thank you SO much for writing this book! I literally keep it on hand. It has helped my relationship with my daughter in ways I never thought possible. And the answer is SO simple! It made me feel so much better about myself, too, because even though I will continue to make mistakes, as long as I love my child and let her know EVERY day that I love her, the mistakes just won't seem so bad. Something else I appreciated, is that none of the chapters are especially lengthy. Not having much time to read with a precocious 4 year old, I was able to read snippets here and there and still get a LOT out of what I was reading at the time! I got a lot of helpful information that I didn't expect. Ms Adams is a good writer in that I laughed and I cried. With her being the mother of children older than mine, I know that I will be keeping this book of hers close at hand for quite a few years to come. Thank you Debbie Adams wherever you are!!!"
4,Great for the price!,"I agree with the other reviews. I am an architect who takes many architectural photos, both interior and exterior. While I cannot say a digital camera can replace a traditional SLR camera and the wide angle lens is as versatile as the ones I have used for SLR, it works surprising good. With some photoshop tweaking, this lens can take some beautiful pictures, it is crisp and added great value to my digital camera. It is true that the pictures are very dim even with flash but by changing the speed and the exposure time on the the digital camera, the problem is easily solved. If you don't have additional light and the scene is dark, you probably need to increase the exposure time so much that you need a tripod. Most of the time, using night scene on your digital camera would suffice. General speaking, it adds a lot of value to my digital camera for $50. I recommend it!"
4,Great lens to use <u>without</u> a flash.,"Does a great job of capturing everything in one shot. The only problem with using the wide-angle lens with my camera (Kodak DX7630) is the flash. It seems that the size of the lens interferes with the light of the flash and leaves a shadow on the lower left side of the picture. As of yet, I don't think Kodak offers an accessory flash, but maybe someday soon."
4,Classic Statlers,"What you have to understand is that these excerpts were taken from older TV shows that were apparently archived on 3/4"" videotape, so the video quality is not up to today's standards, but the sound is good and that's what you purchase this for anyway."
2,Hard to read,"I received a complimentary copy of this book from Thomas Nelson through their BookSneeze program. This book talks about the humor that is found in much of C. S. Lewis's work. The author is trying to show us why Lewis found laughter so important, and what part it played in his work and in his life. I was very excited to receive this book. I have always been fascinated with Lewis. I thought that this would be a great way to learn more about the man and his work. I found this book very hard to get into. The author has a Ph.D. and I felt that it was written more as a scholarly article than a book for the everyman. I found the writing had to read, and became confused early on. I was not able to finish the book. I think that the author knows his stuff, but it was not conveyed very well. I would give this book 2/5 stars."
2,Not a Laughing Matter,"Surprised by Laughter: The Comic World of C.S. LewisI got this book free for blogging about it at Booksneeze.comI was hoping for a light fun engaging uplifting for my trip overseas; then I got it. It is huge! And by a PhD. I took me a while to pick it up again but while often it is wordy, I am glad I am reading it, though slowly.Several months later-I was glad I read it but it kept getting slower and slower.I recommend this book if you are a huge fan of CS Lewis and want more information about his life, companions and writings; also if you are interested in the dissecting of literature.Linovall does disclaim that writing about humor is not humorous and he is correct. There were moments of interest and insight into different topics (such as joy, food, wit, taboo, nature) but mostly this is a academic dissertation packaged in a book."
3,Very detailed but tough to get through.,"This book offers a lot of detail and a unique perspective into the life of C.S. Lewis. The approach of looking at his life through the lens of humor and laughter is unique and one that would be worthwhile for to do for other individuals as well. However, the writing is very academic, much like something a university professor would write. There were definitely some good quotes I highlighted and will refer to, but much of the book was difficult to digest mentally. I would enjoy the book more, I think, if I were taking a class that was also reading and talking about the book. Not a leisure read but one that is very well written and intelligent."
3,Couldn't get through it,"Let me start out by saying I love all things C.S. Lewis. I had great hopes for this book, but I could not get myself to read more than part one. While it was interesting, it just didn't keep me going. I know there are some great reviews of this book, and if I persevered, I might come to the same conclusion, but right now, I just can't get through it. So needless to say, this book will go on my shelf with my collection of books about and by C.S. Lewis and I will pick it up at a later date and try to read it all the way through.Sadly I only give this book 3 stars.I received this book from Book Sneeze (Thomas Nelson Publishers) for the purpose of this review."
2,Very long & boring book,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from this book. I thought it would be funny due to the title, but I didn't find it ""comical"". It was more like dry humor. I was ready to give up on this book before the end of the first chapter. This book was very long and I really had to push myself to get to the end of this book. It did have some interesting quotes and such. This book really wasn't for me and I'm not sure who I could recommend this too. It was a very informational book about C.S. Lewis just poorly written. I hate to give such a bad review but I am giving my honest opinion.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255"
4,Can't do without it!,"I've used this tool in my business for years. With no real moving parts it never wears out and unless someone steps on it or looses it, it will last forever. The one I ordered is backup insurance."
3,Informative,This book helps give the reader an idea of what tools are at the disposal of Visual effects supervisors. Good read.
3,Would be great if it wasn't missing Dead End Street.,"If you are looking to find Dead End Street, as I was, then don't buy it, because it is not on the album. I don't know how the record company missed it, but they did. There are other great songs on the set, but my exuberant anticipation of finally finding the long sought after Dead End Street, soon turned to disappointment upon discovering that the discography and liner notes are in error."
1,Unforgivable Lapse by Greedy Record Company,"Typical of the recording business... they take something as sacred as the voice of the great Lou Rawls and then try to compromise it with a shoddy product like this one. First of all, Lou's ""Greatest Hits"" aren't here, and then, sure enough, the legendary ""Dead End Street"" isn't even included, although it's on the label and track listing. Is Mike Curb still alive?Recommended instead: ""Stormy Monday"""
2,Beware: Wrong Song Titles>>>>,"Hi: As other reviewers have said, please be aware that tracks 4 and 5 are mislabelled and are actually ""Street Corner Hustler's Blues"" (Monologue)(Live)and ""World Of Trouble"" respectively....I bought this CD in a local store because it was relatively inexpensive and the ""Dead End Street"" monologue and song was on the track list...There are better and more accurate compilations of Mr. Rawls' music to be considered. I gave this one 2 stars for anyone on a limited budget who may want a sampler of some of the late singers familiar or album only songs...."
1,Know your soil first!! This product has lots of limitations!,"We assembled the product (discarding the box) and THEN dug the 4'deep hole (which is very deep and a lot of work). As the instructions advise, you test the soil by pouring water into the hole to see how fast it drains. Our soil drains too fast for the product to be used. We now have a completely unused product that the company will not take back due to the lack of original packaging.If your soil is sandy or clay, this product will not work for you!!"
4,Keepin' It Reel!!!,Keep's you laughing. Never a dull moment. Enjoyed season 1&2! The skits are great and the humor is off the wall.
1,Food for thought,"I waitressed at a show where Carlos performed a few years ago. I've never been around a more self-centered, arrogant, unfunny performer in my life.mar"
3,Good but not Great De Burgh novel,"The latest in Ms. Simmons' De Burgh series, this is an enjoyable read, but the beginning starts out fairly slow and the plot seems somewhat weaker than the others in the series. Still Robin De Burgh is a likeable hero, a bit different from the happy go lucky sort he was in the previous novels, but compelling. The plot is basically that Robin feels that all the recent marriages of his brothers and father indicate that there is a curse on the De Burghs and while trying to have the ""curse"" removed, he stumbles upon a murder in a convent. The heroine, Sybil, is an unconventional novice who will never take her vows as a nun. After learning Sybil may be next, Robin marries her to protect her. I liked this book but I couldn't help feeling it didn't compare to the others in the series. As a novel on its own, if you had never read the other De Burghs, it would seem to begin slow and slightly silly with all the talk of the supposed ""curse."
3,"Nice about temples, but not pyramids","It shows really nicely the Temple at AL Karnak and Luxor, and the Mortuary Temple of Hatsepsut, but, if you wondered about the pyramides, you need to see The Pyramids - Jewels of the Nile (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World) DVD.This documentary presents the ancient Egypt temples in detail using local footage, stylish period reconstructions, schematics, 3D graphics and animations, and expert interpretations and analyses. The sound and picture quality is good."
4,Motorola Batt for c139,Battery works fine. I was glad to find a replacement this cheap. I didn't know if a batt for this old phone would still be made.
1,Old OEM SNN5947A,"11-8-2011 Update:This battery stopped holding a charge after 6 months. A full charge will go flat after 20 minutes of talk. These batteries should be rated ""Unused Old Stock"" rather than ""New"". My old battery that came with the phone was an SNN5947C dated 20080110 which lasted 3 years, 3 months . This battery is an SSN5947A dated 20070116 - a year older than the one it replaced. I don't know if the A and C makes a difference. These batteries were used only on my emergency phone, which is rarely used. The seller would not replace it - he stated that there is only a 90 day warranty. Certainly not a good battery for an emergency phone."
4,Cell Phone Battery Replacement,This is a replacement battery for my cell phone. The old battery would hold a charge for just a couple of days. This works fine.
3,Not sure,I purchased this for my wifes Trac phone and it does not seem to hold a charge now as long as the original one did. Dont know if it is the battery or the phone but I think we will be getting her a new phone this Christmas anyway so it does not matter.
2,A Better Idea!,"I needed a replacement battery for my V170 and found that buying a Tracfone C139 phone on sale for $12.99 was a better idea, and Walmart sells them online for $12.88. The battery that comes standard with this phone is a new Motorola SNN5749A (the same as the V170), manufactured within the last year, and if your V170 quits working you have the C139 to use as a backup phone. It also has a travel charger (plug-in, thinner profile, and prongs that fold-in) versus the bulky one that came with the V170 and it works with both the V170 and C139. Just my opinion after looking everywhere for just the battery and getting frustrated that Motorola wanted $39.99 for an OEM battery on their web site."
2,"when ""new"" means old","Be aware that what the sellers of this battery describe as ""new"" OEM does not mean newly manufactured. I just got one from Wireless Unlimited that was made January 8, 2006. Seller claims it should still hold a charge but I have seen many references to these batteries having a shelf life of around 3 years."
4,OEM Motorola Battery,I recently ordered a cell phone battery for a Motorola cell phone. I first received the wrong one but after contacting the vendor I received the correct one. Time for both transactions took about one week and the new battery performs just great.
3,For husband's phone,"Don't know how it will work because after I bought it, his phone battery resumed holding a charge so we haven't had to use it yet."
3,Cheap $ = Cheap product,"Got this battery mid-December 2011. It appears the seller has changed, so hard to know if from the exact same supplier now. Parts sourcing & production tend to change quickly these days.My original battery would initially last a whole week (with very minimal talk/use, turned off at night), but now this supposedly 'new' battery (with a 6 yr old date-stamp = very troubling?) lasts only 2~3 days with same very minimal use, turned off every night.I give it 3 stars because it was so super-cheap, only $2.50 with free shipping, so didn't expect much.Btw, I put this battery through the rec'd 3 full charge/discharge cycles when first got it, but didn't seem to have much impact on the duration of a full charge..maybe adding 1/2 day's worth of extra charge by the 3rd cycle."
4,"A masterful ""What if "" story","Kinrade does a masterful job of taking a plausible premise and weaving it into a thrilling and surprising story. The characters are complex and well developed. I've always been a big fan of ""historical Novels"" and ""alternative history"" stories, so this novel fit my tastes perfectly. I highly recommend this novel to those who have similar tastes. It was a fun ride."
1,Don't do it!,We bought this unit and returned it right away after doing some research. This type of product that used Ionic Ozone is actually harmful to your lungs over a prolonged period.When we got this unit we read the instructions which said do not use the ozone but 15 minutes every hour or get too close to the unit when it is on. This caused suspicion because I have a long term lung condition and certainly to not want to worsen it we did our research and found the EPA and other federal cites strongly recommend not using these type products.
3,"good information, poorly written","I found the book difficult to read. I had to flip back and forth between the front of the book, where the text was, and the back of the book, where the figures were. Written for the amateur by an amateur. There was good information contained within the book, but it took a lot of effort to extract it."
1,Disappointed,"This book is how to build a SPECIFIC car, and chassis. the book arrives as a photo copied cheaply bound manual."
3,This ain't a pretty book,This is not a well polished book. It was not written by a writer.It was written by car enthusiasts and fiberglass adventurers.There is some very good info and ideas in this book but the text is in a different location to the related illustrations.I took the related illustrations out of the binder the book came in and placed them in another binder. I could then read the text and see the illustrations without flipping back and forth.This book could be written much better.
2,It's there- but you have to find it!,This book is the most poorly put together book I have ever read about the construction of anything. There seems to have been no active editing by anyone with experience in the publishing field.That said- The information is there - you just have to look for it.Contrary to what another reviewer stated - These techniques can be used for ANY car you choose. Just plan ahead and you can do it.If you plan on building a car from raw materials to finished auto. I recommend any of Ron Champion's books. Very basic and with some imagination and drive you can build anything.
4,Christmas-present tense,"The most enjoyable aspect of this concert is the expression through music that Christmas is both current and relevent in a modern world. The classic songs and the new one's alike are put forward with a passion that makes the listener feel just plain good. Rob Mathes does not have the strongest voice in the world but it is very emotive and convincing. He has become a sought after talent on the music scene doing work for the likes of Sting, Elton John, Vanessa Williams and many others. If you are in the Christmas mood this is a wonderful video."
5,Long-Time Favorite,"I've used this for several years. It tames the fuzzies without the stiffness of a gel. When my hair was longer, it would put it on after shampooing and then blow dry. Now that it's short, I put it on after shampooing and just let it dry. It dries with a very light stiffness -- not at all like a gel. When dry, I brush it thoroughly. The stiffness goes away and the hair feels clean, but it will lay in the direction I combed it when wet (back on the sides) instead of in the direction it would go naturally (forward on the sides)."
4,Some Rare Dorsey Cuts,"The one thing that makes this disc worth buying is the fact it has Dorsey's 1952 Decca side, ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,"" which is one of his best recordings but is hard to find. Other than that, most of the rest of the collection is of tracks that are readily available elsewhere."
5,A Musical Marriage,"The Barbirolli Society and Dutton Laboratories have reissued yet another brilliant session by the great British conductor Sir John Barbirolli. ""Oboe Concertos Volume 2"" finds JB with wife Evelyn Rothwell again making beautiful music together. The three Concerto performances by Haydn, Marcello and Corelli (from 1957, 1969 and 1968 respectively) are the highlight of the disc, which also features six chamber pieces. This is music that Barbirolli likely would not have played were it not for Evelyn, but it is a testament to their love that they found the perfect pieces to perform and share together. Like other releases in this series, the recordings have been digitally remastered from the original sources superbly by Michael J. Dutton. Barbirolli Society CDs are certainly a treat, but they don't stay around very long. Buy this JB title while you can!"
1,Worst. Western. Ever.,"I've never read this guy's other stuff. And I won't. Because he's an idiot. I can see that the author is trying to bring a fresh approach to the western genre....but common. One of the characters is a black ex slave who runs around starting fights and kicking everyones ass. This would have been in the 1800. When lynching happened pretty frequently. Then there's the main characters sister. Who's a bounty hunter. And pregnant. Aaaaand she's some badass bounty hunter who always brings em in dead.Aside from all that...i found the writing style really dry. There's a semi climatic scene in the begining where the main character's store is set on fire, but the writing style is so drab that it's hard to pick up on. I couldn't finish the book. It was stupid and I'm mad that this clown made money off it. At least not from me. I received my copy from a care package. Don't waste your money on this. Watch Tv. In this case it would be more educational than this crap."
4,"Does the job well, most of the time","This caulk is applied easily and does a great job. However, after its expiration date it will not cure. Result is a sticky mess that is a pain to clean up and do over. There are also reports of a bad batch that would not cure, even when fresh. To avoid this, I recommend running a trial bead before doing your real job."
2,Terribly designed!,"Not recommended for homeowners, probably more for professionals. If anything, be sure to wear gloves because it will get messy if you havent done this before. My mistake was not wearing gloves and literally spent 30 minutes in the sink scraping it off my hands under warm water. It got on my sink handles and I still cant get it off. I couldnt smooth out the caulk either because it would just turn out lumpy and get on another spot that was a pain to clean. My little project turned into something much more than expected.Finally I wish I read the back in advance because in the first 10 minutes of using it I felt light headed and short on breath. This product is very dangerous if not wearing proper protection. You need to have a mouth mask and gloves.I will not purchase this product again."
4,Unique!,"This book was pretty good, but then again, I found all the Barbary Wharf books very interesting. This particular book revolves around Roz Amery, Gina Tyrell's best friend. Although some parts to the book focus more on Gina and Nick Caspian (Barbary Wharf's two main caracters), the passion Roz and Daniel Bruneille feel for one another cannot be diminished. Good book!"
5,Clearly written with lots of practical examples,"Excellent resource, especially for the more experienced Excel user who wants to learn Access. Lot's of tangible, real-world examples."
5,Another great contribution by Michael Alexander,"This book has some great tips on how to get these two programs to work together for even more sophistication and productivity. Excel is one of those programs where the average user uses perhaps 15 percent of its capabilities. The same is probably true of Access. Alexander and Clark show some great ways to get the programs to work together. Even as a seasoned user, I found some neat sections that opened my eyes. For me the best sections were those on Microsoft Query, getting Excel reports to look professional (by feeding them to Access Reports), the introduction to VBA, and the very clever sections on integration with Word and PowerPoint. This book will be a valuable addition to every Excel and Access user's bookshelf (and it won't get dusty there, I regularly use it as a reference)."
3,Good basic information,"Excel and Access are made for each other, I have been combining the two for years and when I saw this book I grabbed it to get some new ideas and perhaps better ways of doing things.I was disappointed, this book presented me with nothing new and I quickly discovered some of the stuff that I was already doing was more advanced than this book covers.If you were approaching the topic from a platform of not knowing how to integrate Excel and Access, then this book will help you, but advanced users will be frustrated with it."
2,Shallow and Disappointing Book,"Speaking for myself, I found this to be a pretty basic, shallow and disappointing book. I (started to read, but then) skimmed the book for in-depth stuff -- only to find out that it barely touched the primary topics where I was seeking to augment my skills with & between the two applications (which was the WHOLE point of buying the book). There was little or no IN-DEPTH development of areas that I would consider of interest / value. For ME, there was NO 'treasure trove' here. [Notwithstanding the foregoing, I will say: The areas that the book does cover, imo, are covered quite clearly, lucidly, understandably and well.]"
4,Decent Case,"I only had my case for a few days, but I really like it. Great looking case & the fit is really good; I would say great but it does cover a slight part of the softkeys, making them somewhat awkard to get to -- not really that big of a deal though. I like that the screen is protected and the key board is open."
2,Case only as good as weakest point,"We have had the case for about 3-4 weeks. We were looking for something to protect the phone as we visit jobsites and areas under construction. The case it self was great, but after breaking the button for the belt clip a second time (we repaired it once), we have abandon the product for a softcase. The back of a softcase absorbs the phone being caught or bump into things where as the aluminum case is rigid and the button snaps off when it has any twisting energy applied to it(not in line with the button's axis). In a more moderate enviroment the case may be a good match, but I wonder if would be a matter of time before it snaged on a seat belt with the same result. It did bounce well"
2,Blocks signal.,"This case protects the phone very well. so well that it also blocks the phone signal. if you take it off you get at least one bar more than you had without the phone. and in a mettle building, there is no way you are gonna get signal. i guess it is a good case if you are always somewhere where you get full bars. but i wouldn't recommend it."
2,they totaly messed up!!!!!!!,They totaly and completly messed up on the morphs. I've read the books and then saw the movie and I realized that they got all the morphs wrong! I thought Rachel was supposed to morph an elephant and the tiger Jake morphs isn't white. Also the hawks that they use aren't Red tailes. They should have read the books first!!!!!!!
4,Review of Part 1,"I watched this video 2 days ago and it fascinated me and my 8-year old son...the acting is good and these kids are more or less similar to the characters in the book but totally different. With books turned into a TV series, you cannot really expect a ""literal"" copy of the book to be turned into a TV series but it's still entertaining to watch. I just wish they have this series in reruns or something....and continue to fascinate young generations like my son."
3,It's entertaining but read the books,"I'll start with the bad then go to the good...BAD:the andalites are really cheap-looking.The producers shoulden't have tried to stick a whole book in 30min.They also should have stayed in order following the books(1,2,3so-on not 1,2,3,16) GOOD:the morphing was really cool and the suspence was awsome. The plot sort-of followed the books and the computer animation was great IN A NUT SHELL:the books where definatly better but the movie/series was okay and the grapics/com. animation was great."
3,"Good, but not as good as the books","While I like it, the numerous inconsistancies with the books are most displeasing. But Christopher Ralph is sooooooo cute!"
3,HEY!!!,"GARRETT COLVIN...I AM A BIGGER FAN THEN you ARE, and YOU SPELLED ""recommend"" wrong!!!!!but, anyways, the movie IS good!"
3,"Good start, bad after taste",I love the books but the Jake and Marco meet Tobias When his head is getting stuffed down a toilet! Not by sheer guidence by Jake's dog Homer. And were are the Taxxons!?!? Other than that it was good. I only have this one so.
2,ummmm,"I only saw like two shows, but theese are nothing compared to the awsome books! I wish they copied the books axactly and got better acters, then i'd be worth it!"
2,"Animorphs The Invasion Series pt. 1, The Incasion Begins!","I am a really big Animorphs fan, and to tell you the truth, this show sucked compared to the book series. A lot of the books' story's were meshed into one, making an akward episode. Also they left us at a cliffhanger point!!They practically made this show right out of a stupid dream!"
1,Stick with the books.,"The only reason why I even bought this video was because I don't have cabel and it was on sale. It was very disapointing. The actors were too old and were not good. The graphics were a disaster. Not enough morphing, not enough alliens, and not enough like the books. Ok, I know the people tryed to make it good and it couldn't be exactly like the books, but come on! It was like the show didn't have enough money to make it even decent. Face it, the ""special efects"" were not very special."
1,Don't buy this videoe,"Say this. Brooke and that cassie girl can't act at all. i mean it. the graphics stink. you have to strain your eyes to se e the aliens. So far i've seen only 2 cout em 2 horkbajir and a andalite you can't even see. and hork bajir can talk. Not make that squishy noise. There are not any, Taxxxons, gedds, helmacrons, lerreans, and not even Erkek. Then the actors act badly and that guy whom act like jake. Get another. he looks nothing like in the books and the attittude is totally opposite. Tobias, well he can stick to it. He's stuck as a hawk. Ax. He would be perfect if he was younger. they want money only."
1,Stupid! Stick with the books!,"Pulleze! Those guys must be kidding. this show is stupid! ( I still luv the books.) Any way, the morphing is very fast. Then the people can't act. Plus they are very old. I mean. Tobias is 22 and rachel is 15. READ THE BOOKS!"
5,Da-Bomb,I say the videos should keep comming out beacuse then you can see what happens and not just see it in your head. Who cares if they aret the same as the books? Animorphs are Da-Bomb and thats the bottom line caus Maybop said so.
3,What happened to the spandex?,"The new movies out aren't anywhere near the captivating series by K.A Applegate. Many things bother me and (since I have read the reviews)many others are also bothered.I think the producer\s should have come in concept with the books more, not just gone off on thier own route.I recomend you read the books first. Also the charectors in the seies are WAY TOO OLD. The youngest actor(Brook)who plays Rachel is 16! And Tobias(Christopher)is 22 born in 1977! Honestly I thought the charectors would be closer to the actual ages of the Animorphs.Other than a few other misconceptions of the producer\s it was fairly O.K."
2,Buy the Book,"Animorphs the T.V. show and movie of book #1 of the Invasion by K.A. Applegat is a big dissipointment compared to the book. The book should be read before wathching any Animorphs T.V. show or movie.The actors are great , but the show/movie is a little misleading. The fact that Jake morphs into a dog at the construction site is not true in the book. Many other details I have picked up , but they are too small to say. And one more thing the dracon beams used by the yeerks in the movie is totally not what K.A, described in the book/s . If you have read all Animorph books you would be able to tell the major differances too."
2,"Okay, but could have been much better...","This is the first TV episode of the ""Animorphs"" series that is airing on Nickelodeon. It is based on a series of the same name by K.A. Applegate. The special effects and acting in this episode (and all the other episodes) was not Oscar-winning stuff, but it works. If you would like to see this episode, I would recommend reading the book ""The Invasion"" first. Animorphs purists will probably not want to watch this show at all."
4,Pretty good!,It was pretty good but the Jake and Marco characters look nothing like the covers of ANIMORPHS shows them. The yeerks do mater but so does casting!
1,My name is Jake...,"...and in this TV series, I have been reduced to a jock with a really gay looking haircut. Remember my cool friend Marco? Remember how in the books he always had the coolest sounding lines, a la Cancer Man from The X Files? Well here, his one liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. All of my friends have been messed around with in the worst sense too- Remember that uber villain Visser Three? He's a bald idiot who also looks really gay, putting Rob Halford to shame. Remember Rachel and my beautiful girlfriend Cassie? Remember how both of them were smart, stand-up girls in the books? Well now they've been converted to bimbos by the idiot writers. Oh, and Ax, the very odd but cool alien dude? Well now he's been reduced to a bumbling idiot whom between him and I, has a homoerotic banter going on.Nevermind what the books tell you, this show is the real truth about us! Just beware of Scholastic, who has the ability to take your book series and turn it into a bad show. You've been warned."
4,"Not as good as the books, but it's still good.","This three episode vhs contains some of the best episodes of the t.v show. ""The first three."" The show is no where near as good as the books. I only wished that they had made a CGI animorphs show or something. The lack of fighting is the only thing lacking in this. Other than that the caracters are portrayed farly well and the differences from the book are tollerated. I own every one of the books and have read them all. I've seen all of the episodes in the series as well. And I own all four of the VHS tapes. I've also taped nearly every episode in ther series,but I am missing 3. I wish they would realese the full season one and season two onto DVD. I would buy it the day it came out. With all of the other DVD sets coming out I'm hoping that this one will be released soon.""PLEASE BRING THE FULL SEASONS TO DVD!"""
1,"A really, really, really terrible book.","A link between kiddie porn and the Ramsey case? Singular offers no evidence of this. He just tells us he asked a lot of questions about it. He describes meetings with people where this potential link is discussed, but the conversations he recounts are laughable in their emptiness. It seems to me that the people Singular was meeting with were careful not to say anything meaningful to him. Singular preaches to the reader about how awful it was that the media proclaimed the Ramseys guilty and focused so much attention on the murder -- but then he focuses on the murder in his book, and he casts suspicion on a photographer, an ex-friend of John Ramsey, and even Ramsey himself. Singular's ultimate scenario for what happened Dec. 26, 1996 -- a scenario that makes John Ramsey a player in the murder -- is bizarre and completely unsupported by evidence of any sort. Bottom line: Amazon has lots of good books for sale. This is not one of them."
2,Very Dissapointed,The book was dissapointing and I think hyped on the internet in various places. It did not contain any significant useful information. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed from the first few pages of the first chapter with Mr. Singular's references to Kenneth Starr and the investigation of Bill Clinton (re ""presumed guilty"" comparisons via the media) and referenced again in the final pages of the final chapter.Unfortunately, in the chapters between the first and the final, there is little that hasn't been surmised or said before in this sad case. Had been anxious to read this book and hear the fine detail of its previewed ideas. However, after reading it the ideas seem more like interesting conjecture than plausible answers to the lingering questions of this unsolved murder."
1,waste of paper,"If you don't mind the author insulting you for being interested in justice for JonBenet, and if you don't mind his pontificating, and if you don't mind his sanctimonious tone, and if you don't mind being belittled, and if you don't mind spending money....just a waste."
1,"I'd like a refund, please...","This book was tedious to read. You never ""tell"" us anything, Mr. Singular, you merely re-hash what everybody already knows. Do you think we are gullible enough to believe that NOBODY in the enire Colorado law enforcement community knew anything about internet porn before you came onto the scene? It's a good thing you were on the scene, though, or this crime would never have been solved.........Oh, wait a minute, this crime isn't solved, is it? So what did you add? You poked around, asked a few questions, made a few suggestions, and pointed the finger in directions other than the most popular suspects. Quite an accomplishment. I don't agree with how the case has been handled by the Police and DA, but you certainly don't have any place there getting in everybody's way. Maybe you should have read your own book before you sent it to the publisher."
5,THOUGHT PROVOKING ANALYSIS OF RAMSEY INVESTIGATION,I HAVE READ ALL OF THE JONBENET BOOKS. THIS ONE IS THE BEST. ONLY SCHILLER AND SINGULAR DID MORE THAN A PASTE AND CLIP JOB.THIS BOOK IS INSIGHTFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING.THE QUESTIONS SINGULAR RAISES ARE GOOD QUESTIONS BUT THEY MAY NEVER BE ANSWERED.
5,an insightful look at A compelling mystery,As a clinical psychiatrist I have rarely read A more compelling analysis of A murder investigation as well as some fascinating theories that may put the writer several steps ahead of the police.
2,"Characters could use a little more ""fire"".","I wasn't interested in any of the characters and I thought the actress that portrayed Chan was totally unconvincing. Divoff is usually pretty reliable but he doesn't have much to work with here - he might as well have been doing a lackluster version of the character ""Luis Cali"" he portrayed in ""Toy Soldiers"". The fight scenes didn't even touch on believability."
4,fun and entertaining,The concept of blowing up the Statue of Liberty was pretty cool. I thought the plot was interesting and the characters were fun to watch.
5,this book surprised me,"When I first purchased the book, it was only because it dealt with the mob and Las Vegas. Once I began to read the book, it really made me think and the really great part of the book is that it examines each person and the reasons that they were included in the black book. If you like the mafia and you love Vegas, then you ought to read this one."
1,Poorly researched,"A poorly conceived and supported account of the intrigues in Russia under and after Stalin. The author, a low level security officer in the Kremlin and his son collaborate (posthumously)on a story told by the ""cook, butler, and maid"" about Stalin's ruthlessness, his so called murder and the power struggle after his death. Most of the information in the book is based on gross conjecture and rumor. Often conclusions are based on merely the word of one or two anecdotal recitations of events by not particularly credible characters. The book itself has no thread of continuity and tells nothing new that has any substance. I highly recommend that readers interested in Stalin do not fall prey to this waste of time tome."
3,"Fascinating tale, but how much of it is true?","Deriabin tells an amazing tale of skulduggery, intrigue, violence and murder inside the Kremlin, but I came away from this book with the same feeling I had after reading Pavel Sudoplatov's Special Tasks -- great book, but how much of it is true? I have never heard anyone else suggest that Beria and Malenkov killed Stalin with a blackjack and closer examination of Deriabin's stories tend to show they are based on some pretty flimsy evidence. ""X told me this"" and ""I heard from a source that Y had said that to Z"" is about as sturdy a corroboration you'll find. Perhaps Deriabin is the Sven Hassel of the Kremlin."
3,Quite enjoyable world music,"Cherif is one of those who is influenced by classical influences as well as the rhythm of the Sengalese mbalax and flamenco. And so you have music which though basically Sengalese still has a voice all its own.The lyrics of a lot of African music might sound quite preachy to us. The first cut, Kham Kham, has the singer advising to seek knowledge. ""Doomu Adama"" urges the listener to give in return for God giving to the listener. ""Adduna"" is a plea for peace. ""Boroom Ker"" urges the head of the family to treat the family well, and to not hang about and come home late. ""Weet"" urges charity from those that are rich, and strength and patience from those who are destitute. Other songs deal again with peace, with the admonition to not ""miss the train"", to stay away from evil, urging to sing and chant and dance together.This is good, but in my mind, not truly outstanding for African music."
3,Wanted to like this,"I so wanted to like this because it is more environmentally friendly than what I normally use. I love the smell, but because this is a phosphate free product it did a barely average job of cleaning dishes. It didn't handle grease well at all and left an awful lot of residue. I had to rewash at least 50% of my dishes. The only way it worked fairly well was to wash in the absolute hottest water possible, which meant not leaving the dishes to soak for even five minutes. I'm all for ecco friendly products but if they don't work well then they are pointless.I now use this to wash my hands. It's concentrated so a little goes a long way and it's a bit drying to the skin but it should last a long time."
5,SMELLS & WORKS Great!,"I really love this lemon verbena scent and I'm a fan of Mrs. Meyers! It has a light lemon/herbal/floral scent and has that 'clean' smell to me and is nice and relaxing!!We live in NYC and don't have a dishwasher, therefore we do ALL of our dishes by hand--so the dish soap is important to us.I think it washes better than standard/name brand dish soap and it's great because it doesn't leave that greasy residue.I am working to go as natural as possible and this dish soap makes me feel better about what is going on my dishes- it is so wonderful I bought a case! :)"
2,"Ok product, nothing great","I purchased this product while searching for something to use instead of Seventh Generation or Melaleuca. I understand the whole concept of not needing a lot of bubbles for a product to work, but I just do NOT like that aspect when washing dishes. The smell was really too light for me (considering I could have gotten unscented IF that's what I really wanted) and it seemed to take quite a bit per sink full(again, probably personal preference). I will stick to Seventh Generation or Method next time."
3,Keep the Dawn handy for greasy dishes.,"The fragrance alone is worth the price. I use several of the Mrs Meyers products and enjoy them all. I love the fact that the products are easier on hands and the enviroment. The dish cleaner does NOT cut grease well, even in high concentration. Keep a bottle of Dawn under the sink for those greasy dishes. Otherwise, a great product."
4,BEST OF ROY CLARK,BOUGHT FOR MY MOTHER - SHE HADN'T HEARD MELIQUINA(NOT SURE OF SPELLING)IN YEARS AND WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR IT AND HAPPY TO HEAR ALL HER OLD FAVORITES
2,No 8 is not Ebony,"The item title is incorrect. A Minwax No 8 Blend Fil Pencil is not ""Ebony,"" but rather ""Driftwood, Early American, Special Walnut, Provincial Dark Walnut."" Look at the Minwax.com website. The picture shown with the item description must be old packaging. If you want Ebony color, you need to get a Minmax No 9 Blend Fil Pencil. Unfortunately, Amazon does not appear to sell a No 9. At least not at the time when I ordered this. To Amazon's credit, they did return the pencil and send me another. But it was also a No 8 so I could not use it. The product itself is fine, but I still need to rate two stars because receiving the incorrect color (twice) caused me a couple weeks delay in my project."
3,Average story,"Many others have recapped the story so I'll just give my humble two cents. The setting was good and different than the typical historical romance. However, the characters were not impressive, indecisive and at times annoying.He was a manly man who pretty much raped her a couple of times. She was just annoying in that she didn't know what she wanted other than to get away. Her mother had a ""happy"" marriage yet didn't tell her husband about sneaking her daughter out of town.Three stars for originality but the story was nothing special."
3,Another great Kinkade book!!!,"Reading 'A Christmas Promise' was another visit to one of my favorite places - Cape Light. Amid old friends and meeting new ones, the fiction novel was a delightful as well as thought-provoking read. Kinkade and Spencer weave a believable story interlinked with Christian beliefs, which combine with the reader's empathy, and give a wholesome and fun message that is very much like the season written about - a wonderful Christmas gift to the reader!"
2,Book was not in great condition and missing cover.,I have bought several books from this series and they all have been rated uses and very good or acceptable. I have had no complaints thus far. This book was not in the best condition and there was no cover. Although it was shipped in a timely fashion I was very disappointed in the quality of the book.
5,Love most all of Kinkade books,I read alot the combination of Thomas Kinkade and Miss spencer is great. When reading his books you can almost in vision the scene they are portaying.
1,disappointing,"I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead."
1,Stupidest thing I have ever seen.,An absolute joke and waste of money. A 30-minute 1970s era playboy video that contains the most useless information and outrageous narration you've ever heard.
3,Good But Not Great,"This video is good for those wishing a quick lesson in oral sex. The first 15 minutes is devoted to showing how one man pleasures his women, then vise versa for the next 15 minutes. Unfortunately, only a few techniques are demonstrated within its short time frame."
4,An excellent text for anyone dealing with BPD,"This book lays out a reasonable and realistic plan for confronting and managing the various problems faced by someone suffering from BPD. A must read for patients, therapists and supportive friends or family."
2,Buy the workbook,"This method, named by the author as DBT, is the most successful method of working with clients with Borderline Personality Disorder. Unfortunately, the hardback book is extremely and unnecessarily wordy. One has to wonder if the author was paid by the number of words. Definitely purchase her workbook, but I am not so sure this book is worth the money, as everything you need is in the workbook. Borrow a copy of this book before you buy it."
5,The Text for treatment of BPD,"What can I say? If you're going to learn Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for BPD- you have to have this text. You should also buy the Skills Manual since there are references to it.I've used some of these skills/techniques with patients who have some of these traits but not BPD - there are great strategies for Behavior Analysis and determining intervention strategies, not to mention validation techniques.On the other hand - if you are going to treat BPD - make sure to also have a clinical supervisor - it's a very complex population. There are actually on-line courses at Behavioral Tech (Marsha Linehan's Institute) where you can learn on an interactive site, as well."
1,Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder,"My hats off to Marsha Linehan for pursuing the treatment of those suffering with emotional disorders in a scientific method. The copy I purchased was published in 2004, and may be significantly out-of-date by now. It is a work in progress, and much of it describes techniques that have been tried, but have failed. In my opinion, this book is written for therapists who specialize in treating BPD. To me, it seems like a research manuel intended for professionals, not a self-help book for patients or families of patients. Unfortunately, most people with these types of disorders will not be able to afford this type of intensive professional help, nor will they seek it.I found the book painfully tedious to even browse through. I would recommend that the average reader instead check out books authored by Randi Kreger on the subject of borderline personality disorder."
1,A Total Waste of Paper,"At first I thought the author, Marsha Linehan, was a mental patient herself or perhaps foreign-born because this book is so badly written. It's full of new age cliches, tossed in with Eastern mysticism and the author's own ramblings. The author repeats the same words and phrases over and over again, and is fond of making vague circular statements. I'm surprised that an academic like Linehan has such poor writing skills. Maybe a good editor could make sense of Linehan's gobbledygook. I certainly can't."
2,Wha?,"I have to quote The Professor in Futurama. ""Wha?"" There is no introduction. There is no conclusion either. It doesn't explain anything. Movie starts right where the action is. The guy splits his soul into 9 robots. The 10th (actually the first) evil robot is trying to take all 9 souls back. Evil robot fails. And then... Oh there is no ""And Then"". That's it. Movie ends. Lesson learned? Nothing. I am like ""Wha?"" What's just happened? Now what? What is going on?But ""Good news everyone!"", the mood and the animation are very good."
2,not specifically good.,"the trailers made it look good. wanted to see it in the theaters, and now i'm glad i didn't. even renting it for $5 was too much.visually, it was awesome.the story was lacking, though. first off, it's a bunch of rag dolls off to save a world with no more living humans on it from machines. pointless already. so, the plot is lame, but the story was missing chunks. big ones.i just don't recommend this film. the ragdolls should have been their own singular race in a different world."
2,A waste of pixels,"This is a movie that might have been written by a teenager (my apologies to all brighter, more sophisticated teenagers everywhere). After the first glimmer of promise and imagination, it degenerates into stupidity (why did whatsisface press that button? is that supposed to be the ""curiousity"" part of his maker? who knows?). After that, it just gets tiresome, with a blah plot interspersed with ""action"" sequences. Characters are not too compelling - all cliches.Not for kids (too bleak), and not for adults (too boring)."
1,Awesome!,"This movie was so heartfelt and warming. It constantly kept you on your toes. What can I say, 9 is a great movie for all ages."
4,takes 10- 14 days,"The price was great, but it takes longer for shipping because the company is located in Canada."
4,Good Movie,"This is a children/family movie. It is full of action and mystery and totally immerses you into a make believe world, quite different from the world we know. Worth watching and I know I will watch it many more times to come."
3,"So beautiful visually, so tragically bad story-wise","This movie was one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen - if you completely disregard all the dialogue and the sad, predictable and pedantic excuse for a plot. Seriously - I will watch this again, but on mute. I'll probably put on the quite wonderful soundtrack while I watch the gorgeous visuals.I am so disappointed in the story. Compared to the exquisite, lush, dystopian vision of the art of the film, the plot is so hackneyed and boring that it made me want to weep. If half the innovation and artistic sense of the visual (and even musical) side of the film was put into the storyline and the character development this would have been the film of the century. Instead, other than ""oh, yeah that was pretty"" it's largely forgettable.Such a shame."
3,Fridge Logic,"This movie suffers from what tvtropes calls ""fridge logic"", in that the movie seems to make perfect sense until you get up and walk to the fridge, and while separated from the narrative and free to pick it apart while doing the mudane task of visiting the fridge, you notice how many tiny holes are in it. Leaps of logic and character development that aren't properly earned through the story telling.It is a beautiful movie, and I feel that the texture and style of the world give it a strong tangible presence (which helps to overcome the logic problems in the story, you don't think about the problems, because you feel part of the world being presented). The enemy monsters are scary, especially the snake. So good for them on that front.Biggest complaint: the ending made very little sense."
4,"Strange, but good...classic Tim Burton","This was a somewhat strange movie, but well done. I rented it and liked it so much, I asked my wife to buy it for me. First of all, it's a clean movie. It has action sequences that are very good. Tim works with some great artists in this one (as well as in his other movies). This one is a good family movie if you can overlook the ""strangeness""."
3,Interesting,"This movie was well-animated and had a good story, but what made me give this movie just a 3-star rating was the fact that the story was not as developed as it could and should have been, at the end we are still left with a lot of questions and so on and so forth (mainly about how the world became the way it did)"
2,Prepare for an UNsatisfying last 5 minutes...,"Other than that it's stellar! I won't pop any spoilers in, but even from the trailer, and throughout the entire movie we feel that there is a REASON the numbered characters must all find each other and unite. The film gorgeously and stylistically takes us on this journey together until finally it's like.. ""really??... that's IT??""SO I guess it's not that the ending ruins the entire movie because it's great to watch - but the ending doesn't even come close to wrapping it NOR does it even tie a bow on the plot thread it spent the whole time building. Leaving you simply... unsatisfied."
3,The kiddie's will love it.,"""9"" is seemingly geared towards 10 to 16 year old people. The computer visual effect's are good, but a movie based off of a man's will being assemillated into stuffed dolls really isn't an adult's cup of tea - so to speak.I rated this move a 2 out of five stars.Tim Burton can do better than this I'm sure."
3,Eh,I saw this movie at the theater becuase I thought it deserved to be viewed on the big screen. I liked the movie in general but was not thrilled and was dissappointed in the end. I thought the characters were great and the animation was top notch but I was feeling religious undertones by the end and it didn't fit.All in all...good to see once but I wouldn't buy it.
4,Increadible graphics,I was amazed the first time I saw this movie. I have become a Tim Burton fan because of the intricate angles and concepts in this film. It did not get the publicity it should have at release date. A really great animated movie for the late teen or adult. Some scary parts that may not be appropriate for those under about 9 years old.
5,Good and secure service,"I just want you to say that the international service delivering had given me a trust experience and I will recomend you to use it.I am from Guadalajara México, thankx and continue working like that."
2,Yes and No,Really a dumb movie. The animation was very well done though. The story line was poorly thought out and executed. Plus the end premise being that mankind will all evolve again from the goo to the zoo to you was a little too much to swallow. Evolution is only on a micro level and has never been on a macro level. The second law of thermodynamics also shows that left alone all things degenerate.
4,"Rent it, don't Buy","You have to take some leap of faiths, but agree so much potential but it falls short. I would hope this is a kid's movie because it I saw this when I was kid, it would make think about a lot of cool things, but as an adult not too impressed. It's a rental, but I am glad I did not buy the film."
3,Nine....,The trailor for this film was way more interesting than the movie itself! It was so not interesting that I almost fell asleep. The story line just doesn't go anywhere. I think my family could have came up with a better ending. I would say don't waste your time in watching this movie but if you just NEED to be entertained then this one is family enough to watch. There are some disturbing scenes....sorta.
2,maybe it was a great short-film,"3.5 for the long version. If you liked it, hey I'm glad. You know? Just being honest here... I thought it was a little silly and not that interesting or exciting. The origin story of the dolls and that they have ""souls"".... the machine they fight... I guess I plain didn't care for it and it was a let down. My 2 cents. But the animation was good."
2,Boring and stop copying planet of the apes,I was looking fwd to watching this film. Voice acting is good but story is LAME and WEAK. I fast forwarded most of the parts!! ending is lamePLANET OF THE APES would of been a way better choice.
1,Trite,"this movie is unfortunately a dark, rag doll version of terminator mated with lord of the rings. Full of over-dramatic life lessons you knew already... Too much action, not enough meaningful plot.BOOOORING."
1,Good movie. Bad DVD.,"Great movie, but the DVD I received was unplayable in 3 different players. Tried my Panasonic DVD player, My Sony blu-ray, and my sony Playstation. None would play the whole DVD. I threw it away in anger."
1,SO overrated,"I was SO let down by this movie. It's nothing but a build up, build up, build up.... then the movie ends.Complete waste."
5,xmas present,"she said it was great and she is collecting his movies. she told me she went home and watched the movie, so she is happy"
4,9,"This was a pleasant movie, but not for the content. I was pleasant for the fact it followed a decent storyline. I wish it moved a little faster at the beginning, but it might not have had the same effect."
2,Odd,This movie had it's good points (like any movie) but the idea behind it all was unsettling. Definitely not a family friendly movie. Two stars because there were parts that pricked my emotions in a special way and because it also paper-cut my emotions to the point of utter disturbance.
4,A very good animated flick!,"This movie gets to the point quikly and takes you on a ride till the end. Not very long at 79 mins but just fine for me. I have watched it about 4 times allready, and have enjoyed it each time. I love the look of the characters and espescially the creatures, The one that cocoons its victims is the best! The picture quality is top notch, and put together with amazing audio (dts-hd) how could you go wrong."
3,Okay Movie,"The previews were really interesting looking and I was excited to see the movie as a Video on Demand offering. However when I watched the movie I found my attention fading at certain times. It's not what I expected, but it was a good movie. I think that a younger audience would enjoy the movie better."
4,Great animation,"I had hoped to find it in 3D, but could not locate it anywhere. The animation was superb and the story line was an interesting concept."
4,Ingenious concept!,Nine is an entirely different concept than what we normally are accustomed to watching. Good & Evil theme in an entirely different format. Captivating and entertaining. 3D effects are very good.
2,mediocre,"This is a feature film squeezed out of a student short that was equally uninventive. There's some mythical component to it, but the basic storyline is there are these little bags of crap with eyes that run around trying not to be killed by mechanical birds and spiders. It's visually alright, not really up to par with today's standards. There's nothing especially bad about it, but unless you've exhausted this year's other options for animated features, I wouldn't bother. Up, Coraline, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are all way better."
3,It's OK,It leaves you feeling ling you missed something since it lacks story. The first Shreck was better.Santa Sangre 2-DVD Special EditionThe movie was not as good as I thought.
1,Gloomy,"Dark depressing ,of world coming to a end,robots hurting robots, I wish it was more bright and collarfull,I rather watch goonies or a joane crowford movies, terrible movie ,"
1,Unwatchable,Worst animated movie of all time. The characters are a bunch of talking socks with zippers that spew nonsense for 1 hour and 12 minutes while looking like they are in need of Pepto-Bismol. Do yourself a favor and ignore the fools who rated this movie positively. This movie is simply unwatchable.
3,Is there an audience for this ???,"'9' seems too dark, violent and depressing for the little ones and too silly for intelligent grownups. So, who is the target audience for this feature? A genius scientist creates 9 things and divides his soul amongst them to overcome evil 'Machines'. Silly is the mildest criticism for this plot but I did find the animation captivating. It just isn't enough. I'm very disappointed having expected a masterpiece from the talents involved."
2,9ty night,"What a bummer. I was so hopeful for this movie but it was pretty lame. It definitely looks great, but sadly the style doesn't make up for the lack of substance. The plot, the characters... just not there. The entire thing is just very lacking of any sort of life or reason to get involved in the story. Honestly, I considered turning off the volume and just watching the visuals against some music. That might be a better option. Too bad -- a lot of great visual art gone to waste here."
1,"Awful, couldn't finish it","There is little to no emotional connection to be made with the characters. Fifteen minutes in, we still didn't quite understand what the story was about and which characters we were supposed to care about. Overall, an awful movie, which was really unexpected after an interesting looking trailer."
1,Complete disappointment,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for awhile nowbut it turned out to be a total and complete disappointment.I wish i'd never bought it.It was violent and disturbing and not much else.And the most disappointing part is the ending.I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen itbut when I saw the ending I was like--you've got to be kidding me, that's it?!!I felt I had just wasted an hour and twenty minutes for nothing.Like another reviewer said, the ending is totally unsatisfying.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Has potential but falls short,The beginning and middle parts of this movie are very interesting and intriguing. The end of the movie makes you wonder why you even bothered. Totally not worthy the money or time!
3,Average movie all around,"I remember seeing the original short movie by Shane Acker when he first released it and being fascinated by the idea. Apparently I wasn't the only one fascinated since Tim Burton decided to produce this feature length film. It was exciting as well to hear about a feature length being based off of the original short movie. But to my dissapointment, this film is average in all ways. The concept had a lot of capability to be a stand-out, but the plot seems to have been mass-produced and the characteres are shallow. Anaimation is average, as well is the sound production. The music is, as with everything else, average.For a time-wasting venture this movie will suit just fine. Well, to be contradictory it does not truly waste the viewers time, but I would much rather be watching a film I love than a film I find mildly entertaining."
3,Not the best movie,"A very interesting movie, with a lot of symbolism. I had to see it at least 3 times in order to find the meaning of many scenes.It etertains you, but can be boring for the people who doesn't love cult o art movies."
5,Super amazing movie!!!,"Tim Burton does it again! This movie is seriously amazing! Although it is NOT for kids, when it says PG13, listen to it. As a lover of cartoons and all things creepy and spooky I absolutely loved this movie. If you are looking for something light and cheerful I suggest looking somewhere where ""Tim Burton"" isn't in the label, but for all of you who love creepy, awesome movies I highly suggest this one. It's the first cartoon ever made for adults! Teens will love it as well... so long as they can take it! For those who have seen this movie and are wanting more, I suggest more Tim Burton! This guy is a genius in the world of creepy and spooky!!"
5,"good product, good service",We were very happy with both the product and the service. Ww would gladly recommend others to purchase this product.
3,Not the greatest,I think it's too complicated and disjointed to be really entertaining. What happened to 2 and 3--don't seem to be the twins. I'll have to watch it again--sometimes a second viewing helps the pieces fit better.
4,For true science fiction buffs,"Originally this was a collage student's short movie class project. Once seen an recognized for its potential, it was fleshed out to a full-length feature film. The story is completely disconnected from reality and your mind must picture a completely different world where only living rag-dolls exist. But like their human creators, they exhibit the broad range of emotions. 9 is a movie where a whole new world has been created for you and you are just along for the adventure. You can't anticipate what will happen next."
3,Unique designs and great animation couldnt save the movie from the weak story,"Perhaps I had too high an expectation from those hall of fame producers and director. The designs and animation are great. The story is not. Supposedly the background had been a war of the global scale between man and machine, but things (and the solution) apparently took place in a small village. There were just so many loopholes in the story and the characters of the nine ""doll like creatures"" were not as sharp as the moviemakers wanted them to be. Not bad as a rental, but definitely not a good buy for one's home collection."
4,"Refreshing, fun-to-read, HAPPY book!","This little book was a drink of fresh water after I've immersed myself for a couple of years in deeper, theological/doctrinal works.. At first I thought the stories might be a little 'too' simple, but they were really sweet; and as they're set in contemporary small-town america, it's really easy to get lost in the stories, and imagine yourself in the girls' shoes. The stories were threaded together very smoothly by the main storyline, which is a loving grandmother who wants nothing more than to see four of her grand-daughters as happily hitched as she. I'll be buying the similar book this week: As American As Apple Pie. Pour yourself some hot tea and enjoy!"
1,Sounds great but utterly unwatchable,"I have to wonder why this performance was released on DVD at all. The camera work is all hand-held and very unsteady, the picture quality is poor and one gets the impression the director has never been to an orchestral concert before setting up to shoot this one. The Karajan/Berlin DVD's use some odd camera angles but they have nothing on this. Who wants to see an extreme close up of the tip of a violin bow for any extended period of time. With the exception of a few woodwind solos all the action is unseen in favour of skewed shots of Eschenbach (who is a fine contuctor but not engaging to watch as an audience member like Bernsietin, Karajan or especially Abbado) or an extremely wide shot of the orchestra taken from directly above which reveals little of the kineticism of the performance. After devouring the Abbado/Lucrene DVDs this one is beyond disappointing and actually made me angry."
1,It was a mistake to buy,"Finally, I got the DVD in my hands after more than 10 days of waiting, since I purchased it, prepared my self to watch one of the most beloved symphony I liked,The concert started with a very close up to the face of the Maestro then a very close up to his hands, a very close up to his stick, a very close up to the mouth of the blowing instrument players, a very close up to the chin and nose of violin players!!!!!! what is that? Where are the orchestra? Oh finally here are they, but just for couple of seconds, then back to the close ups again, I start to get nervous, can you imagine a nose and chin in 29 inch TV, I took the remote control and shut the TV off, and start to listen to the music, after a while I told my self, wait a minute, I bought a DVD not a CD how come this happened to me, I wish I could refund this DVD and get my money back."
1,A piece of garbage that wasted my money.,"After listening to this piece of recording trash, I was very dissapointed to learn that most of the songs had lost the magic of the Phil Spector ""Wall of Sound."" Unchained Melody is pathetic, Ebb Tide is wimpy, and Once In My Life is a waste of space. If you want a good version of Unchained Melody, check out the Ghost soundtrack. This CD stunk! --- Peter A."
2,Not the Original Recordings!,"The CD clearly states that these are the original recordings, but they're not! They're actually re-recordings, and it doesn't even sound like Bobby Hatfield is even singing. It should be called ""Unchained Medley"" because it seems like it's just Bill Medley singing. These songs are still good, but they are not the timeless original recordings. I'm glad I got this as a gift, because I wouldn't have wanted to waste my money on this."
3,okay,I should have read the description better. I thought it was old recordings but turned out to be new ones.
1,remix review,"I couldn't find my old copy of these songs. I've loved the righteous brothers since the first time I saw Top Gun in the theater. I jumped at the chance to buy the album for 5$ and made a rookie mistake. I didn't preview the songs. Seriously how do you screw up the righteous brothers? But they did, not only did they remaster it, they rerecorded and altered everything. If you love the original sound and tempo then don't waste your money or time. This version bothered me enough to go find my old copy. I gave it one star because none isn't an option. No I wouldn't recommend it, and I regret buying it. I've never erased a digital copy because I love music to much. But this might just be the first. Thanks for letting me vent."
4,Get it Righteous,A stroll down memory lane for this 70+ year old. The music has been re-mastered so that it sounds better than I remember off the old album. A great buy.
1,"UNRIGHTEOUS, BROTHER","NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC, NOT VERY GOOD, recorded at later date andi deleted after one dayThe Definitive Collection is the one to get"
2,Let the buyer beware!,"One would think that a CD that highlights the selling tune, in this case Unchained Melody, would at least have the original recording. This CD does not. Regarding the other tunes, some are original, some are not. I could not find any information on the cover that said whether or not the songs were originals. Given the relatively low price I paid, I am not overly upset. The CD is tolerable but certainly not great."
3,They were better the first time,"I received this CD as gift and was very eager to hear the original hits as I remember them. As I listened, I realized that the songs had been re-recorded with slightly different arrangements. Major disappointment! The only redeeming feature is that it still is Bill Medley and Bobbie Hatfield. If only they let these classics remain as they were..."
2,Should be called worst of Bobby Hatfield,As usual Bill Medley carries on while Bobby Hatfield is weak.I was expecting original recordings of these songs. Imagine mydisappointment when I realized after the first song that thesewere recordings done recently. Bobby Hatfield's voice is sooff it is sad to listen.
3,This is one of the best collections of the Richeous Brothers,I really enjoy this cd. There are many woderful songs and I just like it a lot. These are some of the Richeous Brother's most loved songs. Some of my most personal favorite songs of all time on one cd. What more could you possibly ask for?!
1,Where is the other brother,This recording sounds like a single brother. Where is the bass voice? Does not sound like the Rightous Brothers I remember. Very disappointed.
2,Link Tool,Make sure to ask for replacement pins...mine broke after removing two links with the link tool.Instructions leave a lot to be desired.
3,Nice instruments but,"The packaging was beautiful and the instruments were high quality. But, there weren't all of the instruments you may need and no directions for the use of the others that came in the package. My husband was dissapointed and as it was a Christmas gift that was upsetting."
3,"A good chuck, but seems overpriced","Unlike most chucks, this one is made in Japan, not China. It seems well constructed and tightens firmly without undue pressure. (So far) I haven't had a problem with it spontaneously loosening when I use my drill.My only complaint, and the reason for the three stars, is that there were small metal filings between the two metal sleeves and one stabbed my thumb the first time I tightened the chuck. I pulled them out with some small tweezers, but they shouldn't have been there in the first place."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this ""starter kit"" as described and pictured above. I assumed since what is pictured(bucket, lid, wire frame & 6 mop heads) is exactly what I wanted, that this would be a good deal. I received my order today and all I received was 1 mop head. This item is poorly described and pictured. Please correct this issue and offer some sort of customer satisfaction to help me get the product pictured.Thanks"
3,less than expected,"I thought sand & sugar were about equally dense, so I was surprised that the package was only as big as a 4-lb bag of sugar."
4,If you want to know about snowflakes this is your book!,This is a great book for snowflake fans and people who are curious. The photos are beautiful and the text is very interesting and though scientific easy to understand.
5,A True Miracle of Nature,"An extraordinary collection of images that took my breath away! The photography by Patricia Rasmussen is beyand superb, the clarity of each image leaves you craving for more, you will love it. Although the text is very explanatory, it tends to drone on... but the imagery of snowflakes will remain in your minds eye forever."
2,Cheep SAND,"this ""sand"" is so fine that it continually clouds up your tank. Not at all what I thought I was ordering. Most saltwater aquarium sand I have used in the past was much courser and did not cloud up aquarium every time a fish kicked it up."
3,Look Ma! The UPS Man Brought The Ocean!,"When I ordered sand, I was expecting there to be no water or moisture involved. But behold a mid-size bag full of sand and water. It is a little misleading because it does state 20 pounds (lbs), however I feel part of it is the water. I let the sand dry out for a week and then used the sand to fill up my sandbags for photography. If I had kids, this sound would be fun to play with and you can basically make sand castle or whatever you imagination may bring. However, this fine grade, smooth, soft to touch sand is great for weights, but will never buy again."
5,Insightful and Realistic,"The late Peter Ostwald's biography is still the most insightful, intelligent and accurate account of Schumann's life and his illness. Dr. Ostwald undertook a very careful study of all the factual material available and drew the most realistic, sensible and compelling conclusions about Schumann's life. Schumann, like other composers, was long regarded as schizophrenic while some writers are still recycling the old notion that he suffered from syphilis and that it was the cause of his mental decline. Schumann was, as Ostwald rightly claims, bipolar. The signs of his illness were in place long before he might have contracted syphilis and even that possibility is in doubt. Ostwald brought Schumann scholarship into the 20th century and debunked a lot of misconceptions about the composer, his illness and his relationships. Highly recommended."
1,tedious reading because of the psychological focus,"While there is much interesting information in this book about one of my favorite composers, the book is tedious to read. Every event, decision, feeling of Schumann is analyzed in psychological terms, and never insightful in any way.. each of the (TOO FREQUENT) observations breaks the flow of the story, and they never provide insights that we wouldn't have drawn ourselves, and this finally distracts so much that the reading becomes tedious. For example, what is the point of telling the reader about the psychological effects of a death of a sister or father? I'm a human being, I know this all too well, just tell the story of this great composer.. the only point of reading this ultimately is to make the music come alive for me. There is not much discussion of Schumann's music, what is there is not deep enough to provide any deeping of appreciation or understanding of the music. Regret I didn't get the other newer biography (but more expensive)"
5,Reflexology Atlas,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He is a massage therapist. I was very impressed by the book. It is very complete, and easy to understand. The illustrations and pictures are awesome. He loved the book as much as I did. It's an excellent reference. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic, or involved in massage therapy."
5,awesome work,this book is full of color pictures and diagrams and easy to understand corresponding verbiage. I practice my techniques on my office mates they seem to like the treatment if not only for relaxation
5,"Proud to be a ""Native"" American :)","Just finished Picture Maker last night, and like other reviewers, I didn't want it to end, (I hear there is a sequel coming). I really loved the character of Picture Maker, and all of the people she came in contact with on her long journey to Greenland. The story kept going from one adventure to the next, from heartache to triumph and back again. The customs of all the native americans were fascinating, their beliefs, their values, their way of life, I especially liked learning about the Inuit....Just a small note...The fable about the beginning of the the world at the beginning of the book was a favorite of my daghter's and she has asked me to tell her the story of Sky Woman every night. How simple and easy life can be when you believe in the magic of the world around you.Read this story, it is truly wonderful.Enjoy, Debbi"
2,What a book...,"When I picked this book up off the shelf, I didn't really begin it with an open mind. However, most books that I don't care for at the beginning always get better. This book was not the exception. I grew bored of the story very soon and stopped trying to force myself through the book any longer. I did like the descriptions though. Spinka is a talented writer and that is why I am giving this book two stars max. Maybe I just wasn't having the best day in ""book-picking,"" but I would not recommend it to a reader in need of a cliff-hanger type novel."
2,"I tried to like this book, I wanted to like this book..","but I just didn't.How many more bad breaks can happen to one person one right after the other? Ayla became too prefect and Picture Maker(or should she be re-renamed Made a Picture?) appears to be born under a REALLY bad sign.Then came the Christian bashing,(let's call it for what it is). Showing the almost gleeful reaction by a Christian Preacher to the cold-bloodied murder of a native, which he provoked,is a BIT over-the-top. The Christians are in one breath teaching love and in the next moment being o.k. with stealing the natives food and killing people.Not something I care to read. I'll stick to the Gears and Sarabande and Harrison and McKee and Shuler."
5,I Love Sherryl Woods!!!,I love her books and especially this series. I'm trying to find the others to put on my Kindle. Her books put me in another place and I can relax.
4,Reliable performance and flexible batteries,"Good quality photos, reliable performance and easy to get extra batteries (AA) in a pinch. I like the ability to record a short sound clip with the still photos. Very handy when taking many similar photos that I want to make notes about when I return to the office. I use it to take photos of outdoor plants. The flash is a little weak for moderate distances indoors."
3,Nice camera - but.......,"We purchased this camera because we already have 3 Olympus cameras in use and compatibility is important. Also, this model was one of the few digital cameras to still use AA batteries, which is important when you need a cheap and easy to obtain backup power source. However, for reasons known only to Olympus they decided to change the USB cable to a non-standard plug on the camera end of the cable. When you have to plug into 10-15 different computers in different offices, standardization is important. A camera that can't be used because somebody lost an oddball cable that's only available by special order is worse than useless. Sorry Olympus, you're getting this one back."
2,Olympus D595 5MP Digital Camera Quality,"The quality of this product is very low. After taking a picture with flash light, the camera shuts off by it self and I have to wait a few minutes to turn it back on for taking the second picture."
2,Default Settings locked,For this camera there is no way to change manually the default settings of the camera in order to have the camera starting with your customized settings every time you turn it on.
5,I like this camera!,"I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, and I'm really happy with it. It's easy to use and the pictures are clear. And that's all I really need in a camera."
2,serious problems,This was my Olympus camera; my previous digital ones were Fuji and those were generally superior. Here are my problems with this camera:- There's a delay of a couple of seconds between pressing the button and the shutter clicking which really sucks for action shots.- I've had some difficulty with outdoor scenic shots... there's a tendency for shadow-covered areas to come out very dark.- Flash photos often look terrible.
3,The Pains of Passion,"An unusual film about sensuality, morality, and the consequences of free love. Two married couples swap partners for sexual pleasure. I liked this film but it will not be everyone's cup of tea. It is beautifully photographed and has wonderful music. Everything about the film conveys sensuality without being vulgar. The characters pay a price, though, for indulging their passions."
4,A Rich Delight!,"I lush film of great intensity and subtlty. The relationships are intricate, and developed with admirable depth, particularly the character portrayed by Charles Dance, who combines passion with warmth, sensitivity and whimsy, and reveals the inner thoughts of the character to the audience with convincing candor- enough, but not TOO MUCH! A visual delight- a memorable adventure!!!"
1,Rather Insipid Drivel,"This film is, rather sadly, lacking in merit. It isn't sensual, it isn't inspired and it isn't worth much time.The storyline involves two couples in an exotic country who engage in various escapades and the (sometimes unpleasant) consequences of said liasions. However, the thin plot meanders and the characters become unsympathetic early on. This viewer became utterly disinterested within the first half hour.There are a handful of exquisitely filmed scenes that make wonderful use of light, shadow and color. However, these snippets of brilliance cannot and do not carry the day."
1,Waste of Time,"Two couples come together in a romantic sort of Tuscan setting and have off-camera sex. Hijinks follow. All four characters are thin and uninteresting, so the ""climax"" just leaves the viewer uninterested and wishing there were something more to the film. The visuals, the countryside and buildings, are sort of catchy, but the characters and plot are hollow. Two good hours wasted."
2,Not hot,"This is not a film that will turn most people on... It is focused on hippies and their perspective, which at times bombs on Christianity. It is an odd movie mixing sexuality with perversion. Not the worst I've seen, but in the lower 25%"
3,Pretty Yet Small,"The bracelet looks like it has stones all around the entire bangle yet it is only across the top, also they are very small and snug fitting, a bangle should have some room would look great on a kid. going to test it's everyday wear will update comments in a week."
5,A reliable companion to any martial art,"Few books have stayed with me longer, and yet it remains relevant to my practice, even pushing me deeper into the realization of what I am becoming."
4,For the young imagination,A terrific gift topper for an enthusiastic child with an active imagination! Bring magic and wonder to a little girl or boy's eyes as they flip through this beautifully illustrated book. Cicely Mary Barker's Flower Fairies are a great series of picture and craft books that open worlds of fun and fancy for kids 3-10. The beautiful prints are classic and foster a love of art and nature.
2,"Looking for answers, found more questions","I rate this book a 2, because I am frustrated. I bought this book online hoping to find some answers to teach my class. However, all I found were better articulated questions and more questions. So if you want to see, in written form, every possible question relating to the pyramids, this book is for you. THERE ARE NO ANSWERS IN THIS BOOK. Furthermore, I think there needs to be a big disclaimer explaining that this book is just one grand, expensive ""teaser"" to the real book, volume two. Finally, I am quite curious to see if there is a volume two or is this just more sound and fury signifying nothing."
5,very informative,I wasnt aware of how many things this book discusses that i do on a regular basis. Will make me look at situation in a new light for sure.
2,Mostly directed to alcoholics,"It wasn't what I was hoping it would be but I was able to pick out what applies to me and the person who I also intended to pass it along to. I will end up not passing it along to the intended recipient only because of the constant references to alcoholics, which the book suggests it isn't soley for. Oh well."
5,We miss him!,"An unbelievably good follow-up to his first book, with emphasis on emotional recovery, this book is fabulous for everyone. It is impossible for me to write enough accolades for Dr. Paul and his writing, whatever I write would simply not be good enough. Like everyone I ever met who ever was fortunate enough to listen to him speak, I can only thank God he left his books behind."
5,Why an angry alcoholic needs to read this book,"I purchased this book because I have a difficult time handling anger. After initially reading it, realized the depth of the emotional reaction to things which caused my anger. Since, have reread and studied the book. Will, no doubt, as Dr. Paul states, eliminate anger in my life, but now have a solid grip on it. One of the best self-help books I've ever read. Highly recommend it for folks who seriously want to get take control of their anger."
5,"Enlightening, but not heavy reading",I ordered this book to help me understand the disease of Alocholism and Alcoholics Anonymous. It was written in a very upbeat way and doesn't dwell on the negative sides of alocholism. . . serious but not oppressive.
4,YOU CAN'T MAKE ME ANGRY,"This book gives great insignt on communication for the recovering person or any member in their family. It show you how to change your thinking, which inturn changes everyone attitude around you. This is a great book to start a life of serenity and peace with all. Thank You, Paul O. for writing this eye opening book."
3,A lil something for all,"This recipe will certainly leave you satisfied, with ingredients such as erotica, freaky, ghetto, romantic & far fetched. Brenda Thomas' ""Maxed Out"" teacher turned stripper was erotic, risque' and insightful. Crystal Lacey Winslow's ""Sex, Sin & Brooklyn"" was the most scary, wild, ghettofied, freakiest of them all. Rochelle Alers' ""Summer Madness"" was a very romantic tale with a breath of fresh air that will remind you that your knight in shining armour may still be out there just waiting to rescue you from always being a bridesmaid and never a bride. ReShonda Tate Billingsley's ""Rebound"" was a lil far fetched for this to be a strong sista, but still made for a good read. Overall the well mixed collaboration includes something to quinch the thirst of all readers."
4,Sex Chronicles,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I was very exciting and a page turner. My favorite story was Sex, Sin, & Brooklyn by Crystal Lacey Winslow.Maxed Out, was about a school teacher getting buck wild during summer vacation.Sex, Sin, Brooklyn - Four girlfriend and their journey for the summer.Summer Maddness - was a very shor romance.In Rebound - was about getting her groove back.I encourage all reader to check this book out. If you enjoy hot and sexy stories, you'll love this book."
4,Simply HOT,Four Degrees of Heat would make anyone wish for summer. The anthology starts off with Brenda L Thomas giving us the summer tale of a Philadelphia high school teacher who visits the south and get buck wild to Crystal Lacey Wilson who takes us on the wild side of Brooklyn and the women who pimped celebrities to veteran Rochelle Alers who takes us on Sag Harbor to visit with a couple who's summer fling turn out to be something more to ReShonda Tate Billingsley who takes us out of the country for a little rebound playtime. My favorite stories were Summer Madness and Rebound both of these stories were funny and dynamic.
3,Childhood memories,"If you want to relive your childhood, this will help. Be forewarned though, you children will not think this is as special as you do."
2,Christmas,"I was disappointed in it. However, my grandchildren liked it. They watched it a couple of times. Nothing more to say."
5,Old School Sesame Street,"Love this Christmas movie, it's been a favorite in our family for years. Personally like that it's BE (before Elmo)."
5,Timeless,"This special is very memorable. We own it on vhs (from my childhood). My daughter just turned a year old and isn't like most children. She is not an Elmo fan, but adores Big Bird. For the past few weeks, we have watched this several times. She LOVES it! I have to say, I don't even mind watching it over and over.Everyone should own this for their children..and watch it each year! The songs are catchy and my baby girl loves to watch them ice skate in the beginning!"
3,Careful,"Nice DVD with the exception that Oscar is SUPER negative, even calling Big Bird ""stupid"". My two year old son loves this DVD. I figure if he says stupid it will give me the opportunity to explain to him that we don't use that word in our family. Otherwise, it's a nice old school sesame street DVD."
3,ho hum,"I bought this based on the ""rave"" reviews I read here on amazon.com. But, IMHO this DVD was not ""all that and a bag of chips""...it was okay, but nothing my son wanted to see more than twice."
2,Scary for some <3 year olds,"The first segment is the Sesame Street characters ""on ice"", and Oscar goes flying through the air, out of the ice rink, and crashes into things. Pretty scary for our 2.5 year old."
3,This DVD is ok,"I didn't read carefully enough before buying this DVD. It's very old... back when Mr. Hooper ran the store and Kermit was on the show (and no Elmo!). I wanted a dvd where the characters sang a lot of traditional songs. But this really only had two traditional songs... the rest were written (I assume) for this show. My 17-month-daughter loves it, so who am I to argue. It just wasn't what I'd hoped for."
2,Boring for a young toddler!!,My daughter is 18 months and I was so excited to teach her a bit more about Xmas through a Sesame Street DVD. We were both disappointed. It's sooooo dated and generic. Way too much dialog for a toddler to stay attentive. It's mostly people ice skating and talking. Not enough muppet characters. I'll keep it for a few years and maybe when she's older she might enjoy it.
2,Sesame Street - Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,Not one of our favorites. Sesame Street does other holiday videos Elmo included that are much better than this one.
5,Great!,I was so excited to find this movie available on DVD! I watched this when I was a child and it brought back so many great memories for me. PBS doesn't play it anymore because it's so dated (two of the human characters on it are now dead). I love that I can share this with my little boy.
3,It's OK,"This is cute but outdated and the picture quality is low, that bothered me more than how outdated it was. Seems they could remaster this to have a better quality."
5,Simply the Best!!!,"I used to watch Christmas Eve on Sesame Street when I was a child and I remember PBS used to show this on Christmas Eve. It feels really good to see my ""old friends""- Mr. Hooper, David, Maria, Grover, The Count etc. This special was created when Sesame Street was still Sesame Street,very wholesome and getting kids involved to solve problems. Now, its all about the ""Elmo-palooza"" frenzy. I'm sorry, but Elmo is soooo annoying. He is today what Grover was back then; everyone's cute and innocent muppet. If you are considering getting this DVD, you will not be disappointed. It is old, circa 1978, but that's the beauty of it because it has the original castmembers and muppets.It's heartfelt and warms your tummy. This DVD is something you want to add to your Holiday collection of DVDs."
5,A Christmas Classic,"I have been watching this television special for as long as I can possibly remember. Sitting in front of a fire, after eating a lovely Christmas Eve dinner, anticipating Christmas Day, my parents, myself (now 29) and my brother (now 27) and sister (now 22), have continued to watch this year after year. It still chokes me up and makes me laugh, despite having seen it 28 years in a row! The stories are lovely and the music is fabulous. To this day ""Feliz Navidad"" holds a special place in my heart. Now that I am married with a child on the way, I can't wait to pass down this tradition and raise my children watching this video every Christmas Eve. It is a classic that I and all of my family will always cherish."
5,Not to be missed,"Truly classic Sesame Street, wonderful (though not ""tradtional"") music and 1970s charm. I have never seen a show or even a book answer the ""Santa"" question in a better way. Really catches the true spirit of the holiday.Makes me miss the old Sesame Street!!Found our copy for 25c at a yard sale, I will need to updgrade to DVD before we wear out the old tape!"
1,poor quality,"How you anyone charge people to watch this?Poor image quality, poor screen shot overall.And it is very short.Does not make you want to visit those places."
2,short life,"i purchased one in 2008 as well. mine lasted for 3 years, better than 1.5 but still not what i expected. it is still in one piece but the code came up for MAF and i'm getting the same symptoms before i replaced it."
2,Not so good....,"I purchased and installed the sensor in April of 2008. It worked for 1.5 years and then the car began to idle rough and miss upon acceleration. Upon inspection of the sensor I noticed that the top 'cover', which had been glued back on during the refurbish process, had come loose and was dangling off of the sensor. Live and learn I guess. From now on I will only purchase new when it comes to this type of an item."
2,"great idea, if it worked","Like the other reviewer, my garden is still too early for tomatoes. But in terms of usage on other plants, this organic compatible product didn't seem effective. I'm not sure how many times you are supposed to douse the plant, but even knowing it's non-toxic to people didn't make me comfortable enough to saturate the whole plant. The small bugs that I saw up close didn't freeze and stick their legs in the air (which would have been satisfying!). They just went about their day crawling in the plants. I understand that some sprays act to kill the nerves, resulting in a slower death, but just how slow?I love the concept of the organic use, and that it doesn't have alot of chemical odor. The spray pump is better of course than aerosol. My hands didn't end up feeling gross either. But I'm not seeing it as effective as yet."
3,Very mild and failed with other vegetables,"What I liked: I really liked how mild it seemed. There was hardly any odor or chemical smell so I had little worries about using it on vegetable plants. What I didn't like: totally failed against my squash bugs. I know the squash bug is the last little critter listed on the bottle but I had high hopes of finding a gentle solution to the squash bug problem. If you only have tomato issues, then this should work nicely. I just wish they stopped there with their description because I would have tried a different product."
5,Works Fast,"I purchased some small pepper plants that had tiny insects on the bottom side of the leaves just before I received this item to try.I figured the plants were goners if I didn't eliminate the pest infestation that was draining their energy, so I tried the spray right away.When I sprayed it, I made sure to coat both sides of the leaves.Even though one application seemed to solve the problem, I applied it a second time to be sure.The plants didn't appear to suffer from the application and the tiny pests disappeared.I've trusted this brand in the past for other products. I'm glad this product lived up to their reputation."
5,Works great in a Florida garden!,We have problems with our garden attracting local bugs. Our corn was getting eaten up by beetles. Once this was sprayed we haven't had any problems. We only like to use organic materials or pesticides so this fits the bill well.
4,Easy to use,"This summer I grew my first vegetable garden. I wanted to go all organic so I was very happy to find a bug killer that was still considered an organic alternative to chemical insecticides.I found the bottle to be easy to hold and spray. It never got clogged and the spray area was a good size.I didn't have too many problems with my tomatoes. I noticed bugs once and I killed them and then sprayed the plants, per the instructions. After that I didn't have any other problems. I hope it was a preventative measure, but it did the trick.There is a lot in a 32 ounce bottle so I have plenty more for next season, as my garden is getting close to being done. I am very glad I found this option to help control insects in my garden."
4,Seems to work just fine,I'm a novice at gardening (this is my first year having tomatoes at all) and so I don't really know what bugs I'm supposed to be on the lookout for but I've been using this since my first vegetables plants have started to flower and produce and it seems to be working just fine. I've had plenty of yummy delicious vegetables this summer so I'm hoping it continues to work and I don't encounter a fall plague of locusts or something. If I continue through the summer bug free I'll definitely be using this again next year.
3,Inconclusive results,"We have several tomato plants that have been infested with little white bugs (I believe they are mealy bugs) that suck the sap out of the stems and leaves. After a couple of months of using the spray, I have not detected a clear improvement in the bug problem. These bugs are very hard to eliminate however, and the spray may work effectively on other pests. The package claims that the bugs are killed on contact, although I didn't really observe this. The bugs are largely immobile, and mostly I ended up removing them by hand. It may have reduced or stopped the multiplication of eggs and new bugs however. I will continue to apply it to see if an improvement is noticeable."
5,Bugs be gone! Naturaly,"I have not tried in on my tomatoe plants yet as it is still freezing in our area, but have sprayed it on my new green bean plants that the bugs were chewing on, and it seems to have stopped the chewing and will give the little plants a chance to grow. I like the fact that this product is a natural insect killer and not harmeful to humans. I will update later and let you know how it works on our tomato plants."
2,Protects Against Some But Not Most,"I've been gardening for many years and I'm always looking for better ways to protect my plants from insects without risking our health soSafer Brand 5085 Tomato & Vegetable Insect Killerwas worth the shot.About all I can say is that it wasn't horrible; compared to other products, it did keep some of the pesky insects away. However, I still I had quite a few insects that seemed to be immune to it.Comparing it to past products I've used, I'd have to say this one only gets 2 out of 5 stars because I felt as though I was using something only a step above water."
4,"It works, it's safe, but you have to use a lot","I have used this product in the past and was pleased with the results, and decided to use this sample on a Meyer Llemon tree that had become infested with spider mites. I use the skin on these lemons, and I have had to wipe down each leaf individually because I did not want to use something toxic. I decided to try the Safer brand on the tree and it has been very effective - an immediate reduction in the mites and their webs.The one negative is that you have to use a LOT of this product - just two treatments and the bottle is half empty. Lemon trees also have thick, waxy leaves, so unlike other reviewers, I did not experience the leaves turning reddish brown, which is a plus."
3,It's alright though not great,"I appreciate the option of having a safe alternative to nasty chemical pesticides. And it's a reasonable price. Part of the effectiveness of this product will have to do with where you live. Different regions have varying degrees of insect problems. Here in the northwest, there really isn't as much of a problem (I'm told) as in other areas of the country. We have sprayed this on tomato plants and it seems to be working. I would rather have a mostly-effective natural pesticide than a completely-effective chemical one. I guess it helps that we don't grow a lot of our own vegetables. A 32 ounce bottle goes a long way when you only have a few plants to spray."
3,So So,"It worked...kind of. Had to use a whole 32oz bottle of this spray.(Used on two plants) The next day about 15% of the bugs returned. Good thing I bought two bottles. If I had to do it all over again. I would try something different. So, I gave it 3 stars because it did work but a small percentage of bugs returned the next day. And are still returning. Also, there has been zero rain and I never water the leaves."
3,Not completely sure if it did in fact work....,"I used this about 4 times on my Jalapeno and tomato crops. I DID apparently see a reduction over last year over the flying bugs which land on the leaves and munch away. It didn't stop though.I can't be completely sure, because the hot weather may have just as easily kept the bug colonies down.I'm not sure I'll continue to use this product, since the plants are HUGE, I like to get it done quickly, will need to go with a pump spayer of a bulk-sized product. The trigger format is just too slow."
4,Chick lit with a twist,"I picked up this book out of desperation (could not find anything else to purchase at the bookstore). The cover was fun and I admit, I do buy books based on their covers sometimes.What a joy! This book was such fun to read. Not too silly and not too serious - a good blend of the two. I even liked all the characters,which is nice and rare in chick lit books these days.The writing is fun and breezy and although I must admit that I did not really find there was a huge plot going on, the end completely caught me by surprise!!!If you like chick lit, this is a good one. Enjoy."
3,"Small book, but good.","A Temple Room with the correct paraphernalia is one of the requisites for most systems of Hermetic Magic, and this book teaches how to make the basic items: the Elemental Weapons, the Banners, the Pillars, the Altar, The Rose-Cross lamen, etc. It also covers a section on how to make a 'concealable' Temple, to be drawn out of a wardrobe when needed and put back in it again in a couple of minutes. I give it 3 stars because the Ciceros' ""Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple"" covers the same sujects much more comprehensiveley and profoundly, and goes even further than this book. If you can get the Ciceros' book, get it, otherwise, this one is good enough."
3,"Good story, exciting but dark","First novel by this author, The Fear Principle is a good science fiction story with some horror elements. Features some fresh ideas about criminal justice, social controls, and telepathy. Comparable to recent work by N. Lee Wood, or early books by Joan Vinge. Sure, it's a first novel and a little rough in spots, but the author shows some real potential."
3,hummingbird earrings,"Very nice but small they looked better on my little niece way too small for my taste in earrings. They were however beautifully made and my niece was thrilled to have them. I bought some other earrings from same maker and loved them they wern't dangle earrings, but were made out of black hills gold. I also bought some little rose studds they were delightful. Well worth the price."
5,Making a Difference Worth Making,"Ross Talarico's book was an affirmation of pragrmatic worth of the practice of poetry in our communities. Too often I have found poetry, both as taught and as written, merely to be induldgent in its attempts to be ""well crafted."" As a poet, Talarico was on the path to success--he was at conferences with the best, his books were being published. Then he realized that his work was empty without practical social worth, and _Spreading the Word_ recounts the public work-shops he held and articulates the role of poetry in building community and fighting against the ills of our mass media literacy. The prose is clear, tangible, and, as it tells it story, does not dwell in false praise. Talarico is doing the work that needs to be done, and I am simply sad to see that this book is being reviewed six years after publication. I tell each serious educator and writer I know about the book, and I encourage you to do so as well."
5,A Great Finsh To The Pusser Story,"This was the final chapter of Walking Tall the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svensen returns to play the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, Lurene Tuttle plays the role of Grandma Pusser, and Forrest Tucker plays the role of Grandpa Pusser. When the picture ended the last time Pusser had just finished of the last man that was involved in killing his wife. Pusser term as Sheriff is coming to an end and now he has a new challenger. Pusser looses the election and now is unemployed. He turns to buying junk cars and fixes them up to be sold. In the mean time Pusser tries to get on with the highway patrol but is ****** ****. When things get bad a movie director comes calling and wants to make a Hollywood production out of his life. Pusser agrees but he's got more problems then he realizes. I give this movie 5 weasel stars because of the suspense that keeps watching the picture and the action. You can get all three films in DVD right here on Amazon.Com"
3,wide screen,"i likrd the movie ok,BUT,i didn't like the wide screen.it cuts off the bottomand top part of the movie."
3,Bad Burn,"At the begining it is dark and you can hardly see it! THen it lighents up and is ok. THE main thing is my husband is ok with it! He is a happy camper, so I am too!"
3,Disappointed,Copyright 1998 A run of the mill average advice on natural ways to work with prostate problems.
1,Out of date,This book is over ten years old. I would not recommend for most people. There are up to date books available.
4,Well witten with alot of good advice,I read the book and was very pleased to find out about the product called Cernitin.It is nice to know there is other ways to help with this that is healthy. I highly recomend for everyone to read this book.
3,"If you want to sleep through the night, read this.",It works for me. It can not hurt and for you it might work also
4,good product,Memory stick came in an envelope to protect it from static electricity! Good packaging. It installed easley and I could tell the computor ran faster the first time started it. GOOD PRODUCT.
4,Crucial RAM,"Good product and the price was right. It did make my PC a little unstable initially but everything seems fine now. Good stuff, I'd buy more."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH CISCO ASA 5505,I tried 2 different sticks of this memory and neither would Let MY ASA boot.. All the lights were flashing..No slam against the memory.. From the previous review I thought it would work..
5,Great Memory Upgrade,"I bought this memory card and the 1GB paired card. The two sets of memory cards made a significant improvement to an ""old"" computer. At spending just over $100, it was worth the investment to radically improve the speed of an otherwise quality desktop."
3,Missing 128 of 512 ram,"My previous 512 ram was dead and i ordered a new one from amazon with a great price and fast shipping but when i received this ram in a sealed box marking 512 ram on the label after i installed the ram i found out there was only 384ram so i missed 128 of ram, i emailed customer service about 6 weeks ago and i never got a reply. this ram is stable and quiet due to the missing 128 of memory im not sure if i should order the same product again"
3,Audio Mystery Tour,"Cardiff is a grant-supported Canadian artist who does sound installations featuring soundwalks. This beautifully-produced book (50 pages!) + CD recorded in binaural sound features a fictional mystery inside her narrated walking tour of a lake in Ontario.Part soundscape, part fiction, part picturebook -- at only 18 minutes it's quite short, but very immersive."
4,"Good series overall, kind of disappointing ending","An enjoyable series overall. My only real complaint is that the ending felt rushed, and it greatly diverged from the Manga. I would have preferred seeing the Arachnophobia Arc as it appeared in the Manga, even if that meant having a cliffhanging ending instead of the resolution that was chosen. That way, maybe additional seasons of the anime could have been produced. Fans of the series should continue reading the Manga, which is still ongoing. The spinoff Manga ""Soul Eater Not"" is also enjoyable, and features characters which are now starting to appear in the Soul Eater manga."
5,Love Sandra Hill,"I love her writing..very entertaining and easy to read. Like the descriptions of the past, I feel like I'm there..Easy to picture.."
4,The Outlaw Viking with 21st Century Feelings,"This book was an interesting sequel to ""the Reluctent Viking"". I couldn't put it down. I do think Rain could have been more understanding of the time period she was in and not try and do everything her way (21st century woman style). The story was well written and gave alot of history for that time period. You felt the pain and the joy of the characters. I love all of Sandra's books."
2,porn,"although it had it's few pointers it was mostly nothing more than a porn flick from the bad camera work to the cheesy music and situautions if you just want a film to watch a bunch of naked guys pleasing themselfs then this is for you, but if you really want an informational video look harder you're sure to find something much better."
4,Not bad not great its good,This movie is not bad it is a solid scooby doo case but its nothing that makes me say WOW! This is a good movie to be a lower budget movie.i still prefer the first theatrical movies but good.
3,Maybe I was expecting a little too much....,"Wow, I'm split 50/50 on this one. First off, I did enjoy the movie. Loved the acting and special effects. Unfortunately I was also disappointed. The title does not fit. Last I checked there were no laptops, MP3 players or '09 style vehicles in 1969. Which is the year Scooby-Doo debuted. Another minus for me was the intro song. They used the intro song from 'What's New Scooby-Doo' instead of the 'Scooby-Doo where are you' theme. Oh well, like I said before. It was a rock solid Scooby movie but, in my opinion, the title should be 'Scooby-Doo: The Mysteries Continue'."
5,Great family move,My daughter loves this movie! One of her favorite Scooby Doo movies! I would recommend to anyone how has children. Also
1,Not good,"Okay, I am a lover of Scooby-Doo. I've been watching it forever, so I hate to say this about a Scooby movie, but IT STINKS!!!! It's like the writers never watched the Scooby shows. The movie contradics basically everything said in all the other movies/shows. And Fredy as a brunet, seriously?!"
3,Just for Kids,"I enjoyed the theatrical films for their sense of nostalgia mostly. Though, obviously targeting younger audiences almost exclusively, rather than designed to appeal to us (ahum) aging fans that grew up with the cartoons, it was still fun seeing the characters I loved in my youth, come to life in a new way. Watching the first two films with my niece and nephew (6 and 8 yrs old) enhanced the experience even more, as they were screaming and giggling like I probably did when I was younger. This new direct to video sequel was a disappointment for me as an adult. The nominal production values encouraged keeping the remote close and my finger on the fast-forward button (the button where you can still hear what's being said, but the film is just slightly sped up). But my niece and nephew were just as excited as they were with the feature films and seemed to love this one just as much despite an effort by Warner Bros that seems almost shamefully exploitive of a wonderful franchise."
1,Completely superfluous,"It blatantly contradicts continuity established in the television series ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" Plus it's atrociously written and performed. All involved should be ashamed of themselves..."
4,Great movie - Better Than I Expected,"My daughter loves Scooby-Doo and has wanted this movie from the day she saw it in the store. I held out and gave it to her for Christmas. We all watched the movie together and I found the movie entertaining, and so did she. My husband had some complaints about Shaggy. I thought Fred should be a blond, but otherwise the actors did a great job and you knew who they were from the very start. Its a great look at how the gang got together in the first place."
5,An Awesome Beginning!!!,"I really liked this movie! It tells the story of how Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby met and how they formed Mystery Inc. After a misunderstanding on the bus, they all receive detention and get to know each other. Soon, some ghosts pop up and ruin the school pep rally and the gang are accused of doing it, so they are expelled. They try to disguise themselves and go back into school to figure out who is behind bringing the ghosts to life. (I think Daphne looks incredibly hot disguised as a goth girl!) When they figure out what the ghost is after, he kidnaps Scooby and forces the gang to look for a time capsule. I highly recommend SCOOBY DOO: THE MYSTERY BEGINS!!!"
5,A scooby fan( AWSOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!),"This movie rocks!!!!!!. It was made with good director, actors and story line. I love scooby doo!"
4,An entertaining evening flick,"We had heard that this movie had gotten pretty bad reviews so were pretty skeptical. DH and daughter are Scooby Doo addicts though so it was a must have for the collection. There were quite a few laughs. Our biggest overall complaint throughout the movie was ""why does young Fred have dark brown hair?"". I know that the actors/actresses do not always look like the cartoon character but come on now Fred has bright yellow hair! All-in-all a worthwhile movie for our collection."
2,Cast is all wrong,My kids LOVE Scooby Doo. We have seen every movie and episode both real and cartoon. This movie was terrible.The cast is all wrong. Shaggy is really annoying and Fred looks nothing like the character. This cast unlike the original cast never clicks and we just did not like them. The store was okay given the use of real ghosts not masked ( very much like Zombie Island)
1,Croton Watch Repair Kit - No extra pins + cheap construction,"I purchased this kit instead of the less expensive band tool only in hopes of using the extra tools. What I failed to realize was how fragile the pin on the band link removal tool was. I failed to line it up properly on the second link and broke the pin. The kit does not have any replacement pins, thus rendering the tool useless.The additional tools are equally useless. You probably have equivalent tools somewhere in your garage. My advice, skip this product and buy the much less expensive band replacement tool (Heavy Duty Watch Band Tool Link Pin Remover for Bracelet Adjustments Watch Sizing Repair Fix with FOUR (4) EXTRA PINS) for fifteen dollars less."
2,A sizeable disappointment,"Not as bad as Eschenbach's plodding Brahms cycle, but nowhere near as good as his surprising Dvorak ""New World Symphony"". This Schumann set seems to be ""different for the sake of being diffenent"", and it just doesn't work. In the essential 3rd Symphony the accents are frequently on the wrong notes. And the sweeping lyricism is mostly missing.For the best Schumann Symphonies, look for Raphael Kubelik's 1960's Columbia (now Sony) set. Second place honors go to George Szell."
2,neck too tight,Shoes looked good but I could not get my foot easily through the neck even with the elastic gussets. Sent the shoes back and received a refund. Company was very nice about the whole thing but it messed up my extra saving I was getting by buying two pairs.
4,They work for me,"I'm totally into ""moc/slip-on"" type shoes these days, both for work and running around. I took a chance on these when I was looking for something that is slightly dressier for more formal occasions. I've been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable they turned out to be; they are ""springy"" but not annoyingly so. They have a snug fit and I find that its MUCH easier to put them on with a shoe-horn, something I don't normally use. However as another reviewer has mentioned, the finish rubs off easily, and they definitely will need to be shined or whatever to keep them looking their best."
2,Don't make the mistake I did,When I had hermit crabs for the fist time I didn't know that sponges release water. So I put it in the cage not knowing it was going it was going to turn in to a shallow pond. It was very messy and hard to clean up and now I use dishes to avoid this.
3,Meh,"These sponges are really small and fragile. They would be good for very small bowls, but I have a large crab enclosure with large bowls and these are basically useless for it. Oh well."
3,gnr hollywood rose,C.d. was new in original packaging and about a third the price what it was selling for at best buy.
4,G N' R Fan,"The Roots of Guns n' roses is a great CD! Izzy, Axl, Chris, Jhonny made some helluva great demos. My only complaint is 5 different songs, the remixs are kinda cool but i don't see the point. I recommend this to any GN'R fan. The best songs are shadow of your love and Rocker. hopfully soon more GN'R and Hollywood Rose demos will follow. Now Click the button add to chart...NOW"
3,This album rocks!,"If you're into GN'R or just rock n' roll from the '80s, you'll like this album. This is not hair metal, this is raw, edgy rock 'n' roll! Axl Rose's voice is awesome on this album and the tunes are very catchy. There are 5 original tunes from Hollywood Rose, and those tracks are remixed twice in the album, once by Fred Coury and by Gilby Clarke. If you are interested in seeing what came to be GN'R or just want to rock out to some great music, then check out this album!"
5,Roots of GN'R,"This CD is fantastic. It features Axl with his very raw and high voice, and Izzy's bluesy guitar playing. The demos sound good, but the remixes sound like they could have come straight from Appetite. A lot of people gripe about the lack of songs, but there are 15, and they all sound a bit different. The inside features the story of Hollywood Rose and their eventual break into the rock scene as the better known Guns N' Roses. A definite must have for anyone who likes Guns, and if you want to get into it, buy this with Appetite, and listen to this first. Great stuff."
1,Save your money.,"I am a guns and roses fan from way back. I thought this cdwould be fun, however, it just blows. If you musthave it, buy an used one from ebay. There will be plentysoon enough."
3,"Not bad, not great","This album will surely have GNR fans looking for nastalgia. The songs on this album don't even compare with Appetite but it is nice to hear some raw, pre-GNR stuff. The songs on this disc sound more like NWOBHM stuff than GNR. Many of the songs have a basic formula and aren't very complex.It also has the song Anything Goes (#11 on Appetite) but the 2 versions are quite a bit different so if you enjoyed that track you're in for a treat.Die hard fans of GNR should probably pick this up, it's decent for it's time but certainly nothing to write home about."
3,rumbo tapes,"The record lacks about half of the crucial songs from the Rumbo tapes and sound is rubbish as expected. Apart from that, what is on there is cool. If i found a cd or whatever that had a more complete list of songs i would go for that.If the vinyl part is important i would say buy it.Obviously for die hard fans...Excuse my english (Norwegian)Kyrre"
5,I'll take it!,"This show, while it is considered anime, is not your average japanimation. This is an intelligently written show and is highly entertaining, and the visuals are stuck on ""superb"". I'll pick this over ""Dragonball: The Redundance Saga"" any day."
3,Not rated X,"This DVD is great for what it is. However it is shown as being rated X and I expected it to be far more graphic than what it was. I don't mean penetration necessarily but definitely more than just dancing and casual fondling. The women are beautiful and sexy, just don't expect more than a light tease. The DVD case clearly says "" Not Rated"" on the back."
1,These are crap!,"I bought 5 of these for music storage and within less than 60 days, 2 of them have failed. One couldn't be formatted immediately and the second one let me format and store music but the first time I tried to play from it, I got a ""disk not formatted"" (and it wouldn't let me reformat). Forty percent failure rate.Don't waste your money."
4,not to bad...,"the book was in good condition and that was good. the shipping was a little bit slow, but not too bad. i would definitly buy from this seller again."
3,Uneven start to a series,"Amanda is a spoiled girl forced to flee town under the cover of night with her father, who has borrowed too much money with no ability to repay. Under protest, she leaves all her possessions and a dashing beau. But Amanda is intent to get back to Boston, even after her father tells her that they're joining other settlers on the Oregon Trail. She holds out hope that her beau will turn up in Independence, Missouri and take her back to her creature comforts. But trail life toughens her up and she finds herself gradually forgetting him when the son of the trail boss catches her eyes.Amanda's a fickle creature, bratty, and unlikeable. Her behavior in real life would have found her getting kicked out of the wagon train, but she eventually has an epiphany of how to be an adult after several severe hardships.A rocky start to the Sunfire series, but the descriptions of trail life were quite interesting. I have yet to read a Sunfire that has absolutely nothing to recommend it."
5,BRING OUR ROMANCES BACK!,"Amanda was an amazing book! I'm very young and I loved it. Most romance books are above my level, not reading material for me. These romances are historical, but not all *mushy* romantic. Once I had an aching pain in my throut (I can't spell) and it was just constantly ripping at me. So I picked up AMANDA. When I started reading, I forgot about my throut! It was wonderful! I got 2 of the romances at my school ""birthday book"" program, but couldn't find them anywhere else! The next year when I got my ""birthday book"" they didn't have them anymore! I really would like to collect the series, so I'd love it if they'd be kind enough to bring them back! PLEASE! Read the books, they're great!"
4,Last of a dying breed,"Since the 70's, the horror movie host has travelled down the highway of extinction. Until now!Cinema Insomnia is a wonderful example of ""new blood"" (pun definitely intended) coming to the rescue!Mr. Lobo is dryly humorous, and does a creditable job of presenting this ""documentary"".The only negative is the incessant vintage trailers - perhaps these should have been an extra, leaving just the feature presentation. But then again, I never viewed this in its broadcast version and apologise if this is an integral part of the program.Definitely recommended - I will certainly purchase further editions of CI."
2,didnt fit,the professionals who installed it said it didnt fit correctly but it wasnt very expensive so no regrets for buying it
1,does not fit 98 ranger,This does not fit the 98 ranger even though it say it does. This kit is cheaply made from flimsy plastic. Spend a few more dollars and get a metra kit.
2,this a piece of trash,I brought this product because they said if would fit my ford explorer not it does not fit right what a waste would send it back but it would cost me more to send it then it worth
1,cheap,Over priced will do the job but item is ove priced should not cost more then $2.00. Take your head unit to a pro installer you will have a more professional clean look
4,This guy is going to blow up!,"I work in MTV in Santa Monica. Universal set up a showcase for the network, it was like 11am and this guy blew me away! (mind you we get many showcases at MTV, i.e. Blue October, Rocco Deluca) He performed purely acoustic IN A CONFERENCE ROOM, with no mic and Marc his percussionist on his woodbox. He has soul and a plain and clear understanding of how to perform live. If you dig singer-songwriter lyrics, with soulful personality, pick up his CD and catch him live while he's still free at one of his college shows. Its 12/7/06, I'll be suprised if he is not Pop mainstream within 3 years."
2,Another book with significant false statements,"Perhaps a rich abundance of information resides in this book, but unfortunately the abundance is soiled with incorrect information, making the reader responsible for the job of sorting the facts from the garbage.Yes, the photographs are lovely, but the lovliness of the photographs make the situation all the worse because more readers are attracted to this book.For example, the book states that although ""tarantulas"" of the SW United States are harmless, they are related to ""deadly"" ones in South America. Completely, 100% untrue. Maybe the author wanted to make this book exciting, injecting it with lies to spook the reader (no tarantula, from America to Asia, has been determined to be ""deadly). I don't justify these false facts by calling them mistakes--this is more than an honest mistake based on misconception. Entomologists should know what they are writing about!"
3,Pretty pictures,"This book has a decent array of insects, however its spiders section is definately lacking. I enjoy identifying the spiders and insects I see everywhere I go and I don't even bother to bring this book with me since I can never find a match. The pictures are very nice though, I wish more field guides had pictures instead of drawings."
3,"Nice pictures, but not enough knowledge or species covered","This is a good book and the pictures are beautiful, but most insects that I find aren't in this book. They only cover 700 species in the U.S. and Canada, which is too few. If you're just curious or just starting to study insects this is a good book for you, but if you're more science-oriented or advanced in your entymology, then the Peterson's guide may be a better choice."
4,Got a creepy thing? Find it's name,"This is a great book (as are all Audubon guide books) the photos are excellent for identifying those little creepy crawlers you encounter both inside and outside your house, it even tells you what they eat in case you want to make pets out of them !!"
5,Excellent,"Book received in timely manner as advertised, good as new and just as I expected it to be. Would happily do business with them again."
5,National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders,"This is an excellent guide to identify insects. My daughter usually collects insects and puts a collection together each summer, and this has been very helpful to help her identify nearly all of her insect specimens."
4,A great book to identify bugs.,Its a great book but their is one draw back it doesn't tell you which are poisoness and which are not. Other than that it is the best insect spider book around.
3,For beginners only,"I found this book to be overly broad, which should not have surprised me, given the subject.If you are just starting to be interested in identifying the most likely critters you will encounter, I think this book will serve you well. It is an all purpose field guide. If you are seeking more detail, best buy something else.The format is the same as other Audubon field guides. The photos are generally clear and the information seems accurate. Like others in the series, it is well made, just not sufficently detailed for those needing to ID less common animals."
2,"A reference is a reference, no matter the quality","Considering that there are few alternatives in accessible invertebrate field guides, this book is an invaluable reference. However, the photos are not ideal; indeed, many are not clear enough to enable accurate identification. Line drawings are far superior for identification of insects, as they can highlight certain diagnostic features which simply do not appear in these photos. Still, it is a must have, I must grudgingly admit."
5,National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders (Audubon Society Field Guide),"I'm a homeschool mom and this book is a great field guide, we use to help id insects we find on our nature walks or at our house. we love it."
3,Disappointed,It didn't included the one spider I was looking for that prompted me to buy it in the first place.
2,Limited Selection,I didn't find this book very helpful at all. It dosn't have a wide selection of spiders. I was looking for a picture of a Brown Recluse and it wasn't even mentioned. However the book did contain really good pictures.
2,Very Disappointing,"The book is very nice and well done - as far as it goes. That's the problem, though... it just doesn't go very far. The pictures are very good and the information presented is very good. But, the authors have tried to cover too wide a subject with too thin a book. As a field guide for identifying insects or spiders it is almost useless. While it is easy to identify the ones they have listed, there are just so few that you usually find only disappointment rather than identifications. The subject should have been broken up into perhaps 5 or six books - each with as much content as this one, to more adequately cover each group."
2,Not enough information on Spiders,"This book is lacking in the identification of spiders. I have five very abundant spiders in my yard and in my house and yet I have only come across one of the them in this book. I have recently found out through the internet, not this book, that one rather large common spider I have been finding in my house is a hobo spider, which bite is equal to that of a brown recluse spider. Extremely disappointed that a spider with such a bite could not easily be found in this book. Would like to find a good field guide on just spiders, however, have not found any to date."
5,~,"The devastating force of Waters' imagery remains the most potent technique of his poems. So many of the images resonated within me, I was hard-pressed to find one example, one stanza, or even one poem to speak for this talent. The matchstick girl in ""Snow Globe,"" the teasing arousal of ""Snow Cone,"" the raw energy of ""Swamp Rose Mallow,"" the longing of ""Simple Happiness,"" the crescendoing passions in ""Two Baths,"" the developing anguish in ""Airing the Mattress"" - in short, Green Ash, Red Maple, Black Gum itself - draws a sequence of unforgettable images, harmonic and conflicting, into the mind of the reader."
2,Only control,"This book is a disappointing departure from Waters, a poet whose early poems spoke with a tensial strength, but these poems are full of a solipsistic vision that never leaves the patio-- even the historical poems, or poems which should be heartbreaking, rely on an overly cautious formality that just left saying, so ... poem after poem, no investigation into figurative language and its usages, no emotional risk taking. Only control."
2,Listening v. Watching,"We used to play the original audio cassette version of this entrancing story to our baby daughter. Now we wanted to give the experience to our granddaughter. So we bought the DVD version, but it's not the same. The audio was great to play for the baby after lights out, to go to sleep by, to fantasise to Beethoven's glorious music.Watching the story told in visual form is distracting and doees not achieve the same magic for the imagination.We're now going to see if can find the original audio cassette format! But one way or another the stories of composers in these series are a wonderful introduction for young children to the beauty of classical music."
3,Buy the VHS,"I am a public school elementary music teacher and I bought this dvd because it really is a great educational tool. I specifically bought the DVD so that it would be easy to cue for classes. However, HUGE PROBLEM--NO DVD CHAPTERS. If you are going to be cueing the movie for a class, buy the VHS. There is no way short of manually fast forwarding to get to your spot. What a pain. On the upside, the story is fluid and engaging and the length is perfect for a public school setting."
2,Disappointed,"Unlike the CD, ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs,""--which was of superb quality--I was very disappointed in the DVD. I had hoped it would be exactly the story/conversations/music/etc. of the CD but simply put to live action. It was not! The character of Christoph was made much more whiny and disrespectful. The story was changed some from the CD. Conversations were different. Not nearly as much of Beethoven's music was heard. I would buy another story-CD in the Classical Kids series in a moment; I don't think I would ever buy another DVD in the series unless I could view it first."
1,One of the worst,"I'm very very sorry to say this, but this is one of the WORST films I had ever seen!! This film's only about 1 hr long, and it shows Beethoven who is writing music and stuff in somebody's home while a kid who lives in that house complains to the composer. Of course, Beethoven composed many piecies. But in this film, it only shows ONE concert which he conducts Symphony No. 9! And after that, the film's over!! It's the worst! So DON'T BUY IT!!"
4,great for kids,"This video is (as most media works are) based on many multifaceted specuations surrounding Beethoven's life. However, there are many ""theories"" about the final days of his life, and this particular ""theory"" is clean, and excellent for children.I distinctly remember watching it in the fourth grade, and being a classical soprano myself, finding I was absolutley enchanted with the entire idea. It sparked an interest in Beethoven's life, which, years later, lead to the reading of many a biography and viewing of ""Immortal Beloved"", a movie which immediatly became my favorite. Therefore, I would most definitely recommend this movie, (for children) it is succinct, clean, to the point, and for me, inspiring. Take it from one who viewed it as a child many a time, children will adore ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs."""
2,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this book expecting to see how artists' studios reflect their work. Eventhough the book has pictures of the studios, it mostly shows one view. I was hoping to get more of the space sense than just one shot. However, the overall data in really interesting.Benjamin"
2,Hard to get good internal connections,"This works, as long as you can get the wiring attached properly on the internal contacts, which is not easy to do. They use a pinch type system where you just lay the unstripped wire leads on the contacts and then the process of closing the shell is supposed to push the contacts into the wire core. Out of the 6 that I wired up only about 3 actually succeeded in making contact on the first attempt. The others required lots of fiddling and bending of the sharp ""daggers"" to get them to go into the wire properly to actually make contact with the inner conductor. And then after a while some of them seem to lose contact and you have to start all over again. Not a quality product."
2,returned,CD was returned for credit because it had obviously and been played before and that was not the way it was advertised.
5,Just the right size,Excellent little comb. Provides two teeth widths what are perfect for sprucing up my Maltese. Handle is easy on the hand. Good value for the price.
5,Good Comb,This works great on our Yorkie/Silky mix. He doesn't mind being combed and the comb is compact enough to not take up a lot of space.
1,too small,"it's too small for dog, Im not sure if it can use for cat. My dog is a 5lbs small short hair baby dog but still too small for her. I throw it away."
3,2 in white gold hoop earrings,"When the earrings arrived I was very impressed by their qualityThey looked great -solid white gold - 2 inThe problem the closing part of the earring was weak & softI would wear the earrings and find one of them on the ground whenthe catch had opennedAs a matter of fact, last Saturday while I was away, I lost one of my earrings for the third or fourth time and now of course it is gone for good and I have only only one hoop earring left.I blame this on the weak catches attached to the earrrings"
1,Save your money,"The cover of this DVD made me think this would be a good action/fantasy movie. Wrong!! A third of the way through the movie I started laughing to myself. I began skipping my way through it to get it over with. Maybe I skipped the better parts, I don't know. The costumes looked like a school play and the wig on the princess was awful. Not to mention some of the actors were really bad at faking the english accent they used. And I've never seen a brighter yellow than the color of the little umpa lumpa/yoda wanna be with big sponge fingers. I wasted a perfectly good free redbox movie on this."
1,Watch a blank tv instead,"With in minutes of starting to watch this movie, anyone would realize that a failing project at a film school would probable be better than this. I gave it one star only because a zero stars was not available. It appears to be made on the supper cheap."
1,what,"I try to be as fair in my reviews as I can. I try to look for something good in a bad product. But I simply cannot do so for this. I got this movie from a Redbox, but goodness, it was so bad that even though it was just a dollar, I feel completely ripped off. The dialog... wow, bad writing. The acting - jeez, these guys were OBVIOUSLY amateurs - and not even good ones. The costumes looked fake, and I barely paid attention after like, 15 min and opened my laptop because I just could not give this atrocity my full focus.I'm also really surprised that Billy Zane agreed to be in this. He was in some great movies like Titanic or the Mummy, so I have no idea what would make him want to do something like this. Maybe he wanted a big role or whatever."
2,An Epic Saga it is not,"There are just so many things wrong with this movie i don't really know where to start, but i guess i have to start with the costumes. the costumes look like they came straight from a renaissance fair, they are the brightest mid evil clothing that you would ever see, so bright that they must have had super duper washers and dryers back then. the voice acting only saving grace is Billy Zane, who is very rarely even seen in the film, he must have been hard up on cash to make this. The hero of the story who is supposedly the greatest warrior ever born---or reborn, supposedly goes from being a nitwit, to all encompassing sword god in all of 10 minutes of training from an old soldier.This movie should only be gotten by fantasy completionist that want every fantasy movie in their collection, everyone else could do with a dollar rental, and you might say you paid to much for even that, so you've been warned."
1,A crown of lace,"You know this is a total farce the moment you see the man in the hat with the drug store quality goatee and stiff wig. Billy Zane is a fabulous actor who must have been on drugs, had a head injury or lost a bet to have agreed to be in this farce of a film. (perhaps he was drugged and kidnapped) His crown was made out of painted crocheted LACE and the so-called knights chain main was just torn grey short sleeve sweaters worn under chrome-shiny plastic armor. They didn't even bother to make it look dirty. The costumes were the cheapest quality of ren fair outfits that people who have no historical knowledge or good eyesight would wear. (think medieval times)I made better when I was a teenager. The plot was unclear and poorly delivered. After 24 minutes I quit, and i have never seen anything so amateur and lousy actually sold on dvd outside the realm of adult entertainment."
2,Journey to direct to video,"So bad's it's funny... If you enjoy poorly produced movies for their comic value, than this is your movie. Interesting and unexplained creatures, paper thin plot, attractive women, and well that's it... Recommended if your stuck at the airport or commuting...."
1,Dont even think to watch this movie!!!,"what a waste of my time!!! Horrible movie, actors should take acting classes, I don't know what Billy Zane was thinking when he was playing in this movie???ps. review with 5 stars?! Are you kidding me?! I think one of the actors left this review, lol"
1,Almost as bad as the Plug-ins Book by the same company,This book spends 3/4 of the time talking about anatomy instead about how to use Character Studio. It is so out of date that almost all the tutorials on the CD Rom do not work right and some things are missing. The last thing you need is more headaches when its your first time learning a new program. Also there is no teck support or updates except a www to the publisher. Don't waste your money!
1,A Tad out of date,This book probably came before MaxR2. Why they're still selling it I don't know. You'd be better off doing the tutorials that come with Character Studio than buying this one.
3,Are you kidding me?,$2000 dollars for first edition knightmare chess? You gotta be kidding me. Steve Jackson Games so needs to make a third edition for this game because this is just getting ridiculous.
1,bad product,"I purchased this because sometimes I fish and hunt in extreme conditions. I use to use a compass, but after it froze and I got lost one time I decided to embrace technology and go with a GPS unit. I gave this one star because I used it once in freezing weather and the cold corrupted the software, good thing I still had a compass, which i keep close to my body to prevent freezing :) I returned the product and I was sent a Magellan Triton as the replacement unit, no problems yet. It appears that they are aware of this software corruption issue and as long as you're within the 6 month warranty, there is a no questions asked replacement policy. I would only recommend this unit for those in mild climates."
3,Price is good,"The price was good, but the shoe’s seemed narrow to me…it was tight in the front of my foot. However, the return was easy, quick and got my money back as promised, less shipping. Seemed like a nice place to do business."
3,full movie,how can i watch the full movie? its only 3 min i din see full movie anywhere. can anyone plz guide me.
5,A profound examination of the human condition,This is a book I picked up and began reading. It was probably the mostinteresting book I have ever read. It was my introduction to the Classictexts and remains my favorite.
3,I was probably not in the right frame of mind right now for this...,"I bought a few by Rousseau and was excited to get into this one. I was sort of disappointed.2/3 of the book is based on socio/anthropology. We have learned a lot since the 1750's.I also found the text and sentences difficult to follow for any period of time. This is odd because this work is known to be ""so readable"".We seem to come to the conclusion that society is the fundamental problem of man but also necessary?Maybe I am just sick of fighting with so many anarchists, libertarians and free-state whackos these last few weeks.I will give this a more relaxed read in the future."
1,ewww,"I was looking for data or an overview (hopefully educational) and would have been happy with some footage (or ""reportage"") but there's really NOTHING here. Besides reeking of Department of Defense production (ie propaganda) with some irritating music, there is absolutely not one snippet of information about our military operations, the status of the Afghani people or government, the results, the why, the when, or anything. A few gurbles of how great we are, but that's it. Personally, I wanted to know where the oil lines were being protected by U.S. troops, if it was true that we dropped ""Daisy Cutters"" on Afghani troop concentrations and so on.The back cover also promises ""battle footage"" of which there is none. They are referring to a scene at the end in which some U.S. troops hear gunshots and can't determine if they are the ones being shot at. The scene ends with our guys ducking and exiting, roll credits: DOD."
1,I don't get it,"I'm trying to get the sure thing to work with a light scribe disk and it is intermittent. On my system, an HP notebook with lots of memory, it sometimes lets me know it's printing and other times not. I have color disks so I tried to print onto the disk with white, since it appeared to offer that function, nothing happened. Help offers little help with lightscribe disks. Program may be great for stomper label printing but as of today would not recommend it for anyone that wants to burn title onto disks themselves. Of course I'm not sure there is anything else out there other than what comes with the Roxio program."
1,Not worth the money,"1.) CD came warped and almost unusable in my CD Drive.2.) The people who complain about mis-alignment are not imagining things. If, when you go to press the CD down on top of the label, you don't do it quickly enough, static electricity will cause the label to move up towards the CD and misalign itself. This is pure and simple bad design. Low cost design I'm sure for the company - but bad design for users.3.) The product says that it is compatible with other manufacturers labels. I bought some Memorex labels today. The spindle on the crude attachment device is too large for the hole in the Memorex labels and tears them.I've not used other manufacturer's products in this area - but this one is NOT recommended. I can't really understand all the excellent ratings - perhaps from company trolls."
1,No Quick Start Guide,"Never did this sort of labeling before. Sat down with my new Labeler Deluxe Edition ST 5 with great enthusiasm, opened the box and found they didn't ship the Quick Start Guide. Called their phone number, but, of course, they aren't open on a weekend. First time I've been disappointed with an Amazon purchase. Will never deal with ""Sure Thing"" again."
5,Great software,Great software...finally a CD/DVD labeler with all the bells and whistles...I especially like the ability to go online and get the playlist without typing all the songs in...something the earlier versions didn't offer...
3,Disappointed! But it's OK...,"This bright purple boxwood faux plant looks very pretty on the Amazon page, but the color of the one I received is more of a pale lilac and the green leaves have a dull gray cast. This bit of home decor does not stand out at all! Needless to say, I'm disappointed, but I found a home for it in an out-of-the-way place in my home. It's obviously not a showpiece that I could proudly display on my mantle or table.Also, the description says 15"" tall by 13"" wide. It looked small to me, so I measured it and it is only 13"" tall by 11"" wide. Boo...I must say, the plant is enhanced a bit by the lime green pot. (It's pictured on the Amazon product page in a terra cotta pot, so the more attractive pot is a little comfort... lol)Not recommended.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, June 28, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books"
3,Plot rather weak but still a good read,"This book is better than average for the genre, but the plot has a number of holes.Special Agent Mallory Channing and her side kick Kip are FBI agents investigating a disapearence of a young woman named Meghan. They are sidelined by the sherrif's office and accedently get a tip as to the woman's whearabouts-a boat the Big Whiz. The board without backup or a warrant and are captured and taken to Columbia where they are sold to General Hernandez to round out his harrem. But another girl has escaped leading to an eventual rescue. Some good errotic scenes including girl girl action between Kip and Mallory."
5,This CD is the hippest CD I've heard this year!,"If you don't have this in your collection, 4Gitaboutit ! Talk about a CD to melt a girls heart! Are you kidding me!? You're really missing out on something........ That's Amore! BUY IT!"
1,The only Dino you'll ever need ...,"... and thank the good lord for that, because a little of this pap goes a lonnnnng way. I am always amazed when people talk about the 1950s being innocent times, or the 1960s, or the 1940s. Innocent? Maybe we should instead say naive. Because only the 50s and 60s would buy into Dino's ""drunk 'n' fun"" act.With a contemporary ear, one can hear Dino's ""I don't give a damn,"" his ""screw the fans,"" his ""I just don't care."" We can hear all that now, and it is 100% sickening."
5,Dean Martin,"I bought this CD because of ""Sway"", but after hearing the rest of the selection, I can't decide which one is my favorite hits.This is the BEST CD in my jukebox. I never get tired of listening to Dean Martin. This is one of his best collections of greatest hits. Even my 9-mo. grandaughter will only go to sleep listening tom ""Sway""."
4,I had it on tape but I lost it...but I still remember it,"I love the Rat Pack.This Dean Martin compilation is great. It pretty much has everything you need. But, honestly, as long as you have Volare' and Aint that a Kick in the Head, you have what you need from Dino. It's always nice to have Give me the Pillow that You Dream On and I Will though. What I've been looking for is his version of King of the Road....Still, you can't go wrong here. It has what you need, but not everything. But nothing has everything, so until then...four stars."
5,Has it all,Bought this for my wife for Chrismas. After she open she wnet to the back and read teh selections... She said YES! it has all the great songs I like.Great selection - great price!Dave
5,Dean Martin - All-Time Greatest Hits,"This CD is a must have for any Dean Martin fan. Non Domenticar is one beautiful song. When you have this CD along with, Dino - The Essential Dean Martin, you have the ultimate collection."
1,What a waste of time,"Iced tea is SO easy to make. You boil the water, put in some tea bags wait fifteen minutes and add to cold water. TADA Iced tea. Now with this extra piece of crap taking up space in my cupboard I can pull it out, waste electricity and have iced tea in the same amount of time as if I did it without the maker. This is totally useless. If you can't figure out how to make iced tea on your own without a maker, i just feel sorry for you. It is the most useless thing I've ever owned and that includes my own funnel cake maker YIKES!!!"
4,How do you spell S-A-S?,"Gargoyle 42 is a brilliant collection of brash, dynamic and creative literary works. Particularly moving is the hard-hitting ""Boyfriend"" by Jenny Badman. When this woman lays it out there, you'll feel it. Buy the book!"
5,"Weird, but my son LOVES it","I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this DVD, but I am very happy with my purchase. It is a bit on the strange side, but sometimes, it is the only thing that calms my 7 month old son down. He just stares at it. It is broken up into three 20 minute features which is nice. My 5 and 7 year old nieces really enjoyed it as well. They were dancing away with the BoohBahs and having a great time. I highly recommend this video."
2,disappointed,It did not do the job that I thought it was goingto do. I used it in my sink and It turned hard and made the clog worse.
3,Lots of solos,"Based on Ponty's ""Live at Chene Park"" cd, I was not expecting so many solos. Every song has one or more long solos from various instruments. There is a lot of improv throughout the disc, and in my opinion the songs are less catchy because of it. Because of this, the disc has more of a jazz feel than other Ponty discs.I have been to a few JLP concerts, and I've never heard him put so many solos in his pieces. I still like the disc, but I like ""Live at Chene Park"" better.On a scale of 5 versus all other music out there, it gets a 4.5, but for a Ponty disc, I have to give it a 3."
2,Better Btech Books Out There,"The mech combat in the book was good, which is the only reason that I didn't give it one star.After churning thru the pages between combat, I thought ""What have I read here? Nothing but filler!"" There was hardly any interesting things outside the combat.And the ending was so rushed, I thought my head was going to spin off. After cruising leasurely throught the story line at about 20mph, it kicks in the boosters and jerks you back awake. The whole story resolved in less then 20 pages.If only the rest of the book had been that fast paced."
5,Outstanding read! Possibly the best one I've read.,"Recommended by a friend, this book was my introduction to this series of novels. I'd always avoided game-based novels in the past, fearful that they would dissapoint. This book delivers the goods; a brilliant, well-written storyline, game-accurate action and great characters. I'll be reading more books from this series...especially from this Author."
5,Does a good job,Very pretty and it's functional. I don't use it in hot oil - I have a metal one for that. I haven't used it in tomato based sauces either - I'm afraid it will stain it. I've used it making soup stock (fishing the bits out) and it works well. I would recommend it.
4,Love this litte book,"One day my daughter asked me ""Do you love me?"" I and told her that I did, that there is nothing she will ever do or say that would make me stop loving her (ps - she hadn't gotten into trouble). We ofter read together, and I saw this book and thought it would be a great book and good way to open the conversation of how much I really love her, but she should really understand that some things will not be tolerated. So if you child should ask this question or not, this is a good read."
4,Beautiful illustrations,"This lovely picture book is the classic ""Do you love me?"" story, but with an Eskimo flavor. ""Would you love me if I put lemmings in your mukluks? If I turned into a walrus?"" The back of the book has a glossary to explain the Eskimo words. Although this is available as a board book, that version is missing the glossary. Preschool to age 5."
5,Classic book for new parents,"I used to live in Alaska, and was given this book when my daughter was born. It has beautiful illustrations and a nice, multicultural theme."
5,After she is grown...,"We read this when my daughter was tiny and I remembered it a little wrong but throughout my daughter's life when I wanted to tell her how much I love her I often said ""more than the whale loves her tail!"" During her teen years when things got difficult it seemed like she did not remember how and why I love her so I bought the book (she was 19) and I read it to her and we felt the love. The story is a wonderful part of my family."
4,Good book for boy or girl,"I was a little put off by the idea that this is a ""great book for mothers and daughters"". Just because the child in the story is a girl does not mean that this book is not for boys too. My three year old son loves this book and so do I!"
1,Just not for a little one...,"I purchased this book for my unborn child, and well, to say the least I was extremely disappointed and WILL NOT be reading it to him/her... first of all there are many terms and such that a little one just won't understand... second of all I do not agree with the concepts in this story... it is a little bit mean in some of it's ideas... yes it is good in it's aspect of introducing another culture, but at the young age this book is intended for... will the baby really understand all that... I hope that other customers won't make the same mistake I did in purchasing this book when there are much better ones out there..."
2,very disapointed,When this product was received the item was written on everywhere in pencil. Would have liked for them to at least erase to before they sent the item.
1,Unconditional love for mean behavior?,"What an awful book. I see I'm the odd-ball in my opinion, but here it is: I was given this as a gift for my 4 year-old son. We read it last night, and as I got deeper and deeper into 'how badly can a child treat their parent and get away with it?' I was creeped-out and sickened.Yes, I want my son to know that if he accidentally does something wrong, it's OK and I still love him. But if he 'was the meanest bear I ever saw and...chased me into my tent and I cried?' then NO, that is not OK, and yes, that affects my feelings toward him.I want my son to learn that people like you when you do right and are kind. I'm sticking with simple concepts of right and wrong, with good and bad consequences. This book is out of my house!"
5,We love this book!,"We ordered the board book version of this book, and we read it over and over again. Beautiful illustrations, and an enjoyable read. Also a very positive message about unconditional love."
4,Under-rated,"In all the hype that was Seattle in the early 90's (deserving as it was), this was one band that did not get the recognition it should have. This was a band that we went to see pretty much every show around Seattle in '92, They were a great show and sooo talented. I still love this album, So Sad, See no Evil, Manta Rays, and especially Heaven bring it all back. The Rock Candy, The Vouge, The Off Ramp, A GREAT BAND, a great time. Check it out if you get a chance."
4,Please be aware,"I just got this recently because I am interested in learning Japanese as a hobby.This is not necessarily material for a beginner. There is no text, just audio CDs that contain Japanese. It would be very effective for drilling and learning with supplemental translated material, but alone, it is not very useful for a beginner. I repeat, there are no translations, all of the material is in Japanese only. The only English on the discs is the voice of the announcer, whom introduces the chapters."
1,Japanese for Busy People I,"This is a two cd set and the text book is not included. The workbook is not the textbook even though it is supposed to be in the same set. I think it is cheaper to buy the text book + cd set, through a regular book store. If it all came as one package it would be quite a motivating little set."
4,Audio CD for the text,"I hope this is the review for the audio CDs for JfBP. If so, it's a must. Definitely make sure you order these with the text. And make sure you get the Kana version (of the text)."
3,PLEASE use the Kana version instead!,"This is a great book, but if you really want mastery, fluency and correct pronunciation, PLEASE use the Kana version instead! See the ""recommended instead"" section above, and please visit all of the excellent books listed there, including: the Kana version of this book, Heisig's wonderful Remembering the Hiragana/Katakana, the Kana Workbook by makers of this book, Heisig's Remembering the Kanji books."
5,ZVBXRPL! Get your tootsie-frootsie Marx Bros. Boxed Set!,"7 Marx Bros. classics are gathered here in a boxed set that is guaranteed to have you laughing for years to come. This is the Marx Bros. at their best, featuring their funniest, most entertaining films. A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES stand as landmarks in the screen history, and the other 5 included here are a whole lot of fun.Best of all, Warner promises is bevy of exceptional extras, including new documentaries and vintage cartoons and shorts. There's even a vintage Groucho interview!This is a must-have for any classic film fan. And best of all...NO ZEPPO!!!! Hallelujah!!!"
5,Got what I wanted,"I ordered a boxed DVD set and accidently wrote the wrong building number to my address. The process for getting my merchandise could have been better, but Amazon worked with me to insure that I would get my item and keep the discount that I was given for buy several other items. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase."
5,I love the marx brothers,I was so happy when I got the box collection at Best Buy tonight . I wanted to get this because I love the movies of the marx brothers & they are so funny. I just can't wait for the other ones to come out soon in a collection.
2,all wrong,"A Night At the Opera is the only classic here. The three M G M films are horrible and the other two are OK. What is needed is a box of the five Paramount films, five of the funniest ever made. Get the single DVD of Opera and wait for the Paramounts."
3,candle at both ends,"The ""night at the oprea"" is really the only one that is very funny,the other ones,are not there famous movies,and are not as funny as there classics,but they are ok."
5,Marx Brothers rule!,"These aren't all of their best movies...but it includes some of their best. If you are a fan and can't find them elsewhere, this is an excellent buy--if you're not a fan but think you might be someday, this is cheap enough to check out."
4,universal will provide the first five,"This boxset features all the MGM/UA titles featuring the Marx Brothers. The price is low enough that there's no need to rag on it for not having the first five titles. Those films were made by Paramount and their rights are now owned by Universal. Hopefully if this boxset gets a positive response, Universal will get the early titles out in a boxset and you can have all the Marx Brothers films at a nice price.A lesser Marx Brothers film is funnier than most pathetic comedies that clog up cable TV."
5,Good 4 the soul,"If you want have a good laugh, this is it. These movies are old but they sure are funny men. It's a great picture in dvd, compared to watching them on regular tv. I would recommend these movies to any one who needs to laugh!"
4,"The Marx Brothers!! Well, Almost!!!!!",If you have never seen a Marx Bros film do not start with this box set! Wait to the first five movies come out on dvd later this year?The Marx Bros comedy was met to be rhythmic and wacky ; not reserved like their later movies were. Chaos was major in the early movies because that is the way they were in real life; just goofy characters that you could not help but like; going up against high society!!We could sure use a comedy team just like them now!Do buy A Night At the Opera separately!!Just wait for the real Marx Bros movies to come out!!
3,More musical that comedy,My son loves the Marx Brothers when/if they appear on t.v. so i got this to enjoy. The first disc started out amusing but ended up having a lot of long/old fashioned musical numbers in it which he didn't really enjoy. I've noticed he hasn't watched the other discs. We were looking for more of the regular comedy routines.
3,Comedy classics,"The Marx brothers were mainstays of American comedy from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Starring in numerous feature-length movies, Groucho, Harpo and Chico created numerous classic gags and scenes. This box set is a collection of most of their famous movies; with Duck Soup being the main exclusion. This was a big miss, as some of the other movies here, such as ""At the Circus"" are not that funny.The movies have been touched up to give great visual and audio quality, and subtitles have been added to all the movies. Spread out over several discs, the shorter movies are recorded two per disc. Each disc also comes with numerous extra features, such as episodes of TV comedies from that period, such as ""Our Gang"". All in all, this set provides many hours of clean comedy."
5,Marx Brothers Collection,"This is a great collection of the Marx Brothers movies. I bought this collection because it contained a number of movies I had not seen. It was worth the price, because I enjoy their movies. It was a decent transfer onto the dvd format."
4,The funniest,"Our family loves the Marx Brothers. These are not the best known movies, but they still have that MB flair for wacky comedy. Although A Night in Casablanca was not critically acclaimed, it is the first MB movie I ever saw and I thought it was hysterical. I have loved their zany humor since first seeing them in A NIght in Casablanca which is included in this set."
5,Happy Customer,I give this deal 5 STARS!!! It is an excellent deal and I am very satisfied with the way amazon treats their customers!!-Very Satisfied Customer-
4,Worth the price...Good but not great,"Day at the Races is my favorite from this set, but they're all enjoyable in their own way. What makes it worth shelling out $40 for the box set is all the extras: cartoons, shorts, commentary, documentaries, etc. Some of the shorts and cartoons are boring, and others are funny and fascinating. This set will keep you chuckling until DVDs of the earlier Marx films- Duck Soup, Animal Crackers, Cocoanauts, Monkey Business, and Horse Feathers- are released."
3,Not as much fun as I remember,Maybe I have grown too old to appreciate the maniac activity and humor of repeating absurd actions. Alas for growing up.
2,Not what is Promised.,"This box set is no different than the other; just a re-release of the original box set.But I expected better of this one. This is not the 7-disc that was promised to me. Why are the details said on amazon about this box set a ""lie""? I've already gotten a big pack of the old 5-disc set, why isn't THIS the slim 7-disc set? Dammit!!"
2,annoyed at lack of prior information,Very annoyed at lack of prior information. Details MUST state what countries these can be played in. Three dvds will not play in Australia. Beware !!
4,not recommended for the squeamish,"Robert Campbell's Whistler series is a sort of combination of Raymond Chandler and James Ellroy--PI tales that are darker than noir.When a bodiless head is found in New Orleans and a headless body turns up in LA, Whistler gets drawn into a case involving kiddie porn, snuff films and the seamy underbelly of both LA and the Big Easy. Campbell, like Elmore Leonard, is especially strong on dialogue and he introduces many memorable characters. A very good entry in the Post-Modern private eye genre.GRADE: BN.B.--These books are not recommended for the squeamish."
3,Moderately useful,"The participants are attractive and seem to be comfortable with each other. The female oral sex part was very educational and I felt those women were very lucky! The male oral sex part was moderately useful. I knew most of the techniques just from my own experimentation with my husband. The rest my husband said he didn't want. However, I did learn one new technique and there was one that I had only recently discovered. So, I felt it was worth getting for me. I was perplexed that the guys couldn't seem to maintain hardness though. Maybe they took alot of breaks during filming. Anyway, there were alot of closeups. If you're looking for something erotic, I don't think this would count because of the soft music and commentary. I was also grossed out that the one woman kept spitting on her partner's tool."
4,Windows CE ! NO Other Else !,"Bringing the WINDOWS WORLD to the PALMTOPS is a critical topic ... but it is HERE.. WIndows CE-2. I've been using windows CE 2 for couple of months and well .. I guess it's the BEST OS for the HANDHELD PCs. New product ? Well it is ... but with Windows CE 2 for DUMMIES, you'll become a professional Windows CE user in hours. Detailed and visual examples on how to do most of the common task in Windows CE. Well if you're new to Win CE, this book is a must. Remember, Windows CE is not a new OS, if you got this BOOK."
5,Great 1930's Western!,This is John Wayne's best film up to the time it was released. Great acting by the Duke. Charles Barton was wounderful directing this movie. I think any John Wayne fan will love it!
2,"Rusty, flaky paint and gets hot","I have purchased this 465 CFM blower fan from Hydrofarm, but the paint was flaking off and the metal was rusty after I received it in the mail. I contacted the seller, and they said Hydrofarm was going to send me a return label, but I never got it. I contacted the seller again, but no response.Also, the motor runs very hot. I cannot leave my finger on the motor body very long before it would burn my finger. It isn't smoking hot yet, but I don't feel comfortable leaving it on if I'm not home.I'm going to return the product to Amazon if I don't hear from the seller or manufacturer shortly."
1,Fabulous fifties,"This volume was to be a gift (by a drawing) at a 'fifties"" event. Upon opening the book, the pages tore away from the binding. (Dried-out glue?) Returned the book to the vendor, but heard nothing from them since. As it was not expensive, I did not pursue the transaction any further. Too bad."
4,"Hands get tired, but the paper gets cut.","Be careful with the scoring tool. You don't have to push down hard on it to effectively score your wallpaper. If used correctly it does a good job at making little holes in the walls, allowing your wallpaper removal solution to work its way in. I've used this on all the (hideous) wallpaper on the first floor of my new home, and while my hand does get tired of making tiny circles, the product works and is very easy to use. Highly recommended."
4,Wallpaper,"Makes a horrible noise while going over the walls, but other than that, does fairly well to aid in wallpaper removal."
4,It does what they say it will do...,"My wife and I had some wallpaper and some border to strip so that we could repaint a bedroom and bath. In combination with a spray-on gel stripper, I used this scoring tool to help with the job. I found that it does a great job of easily scoring the paper and the resulting holes do allow the stripper gel to penetrate better. If I had anything negative to say it is that in a lot of cases this is unnecessary. By doing side by side tests, I was able to get as good of results by spraying the stripper onto un-scored border as I did when using the ""paper tiger."" In fact, at times the scored paper was more work to remove because it tore into smaller pieces during removal.I think this tool will be great for removing heavy/commercial wallpaper or wallpaper that has been painted over, but I also think that it is overkill for an awful lot of home use situations..."
3,Good,"It helps a little more than going at it without one. Be warned. It can and will most likely leave tiny trails of gouges in your drywall even with the slightest pressure. Luckily, I only had to use it in a small hallway. It was still a little bit of an inconvenience to have to spackle and sand some areas without knowing it was going to happen ahead of time, on what was otherwise unworn and clean primed drywall. I would think if you're removing wallpaper, you're most likely wanting to paint afterwards. Expect visible ""pinholes"" after you use it, some of which are shallow enough to be filled in with just paint, some not. But otherwise, it's inexpensive enough and makes the job a little easier. No big complaints from this lazy day painter."
2,Just use a utility knife already,This product takes a long time to perforate the paper enough to get remover through the paper. You should scrape off the vinyl first and just use a utility knife. There is no way to extend your reach with this tool either. Waste of money.
4,"readable, well-researched and photographed....","....this book gives a bleak but accurate diagnosis of the ways we've made California, once thought to be near the ""Terrestrial Paradise,"" a combination tract neighborhood and garbage dump. Given all the beauty-oriented boosterism about this state, such a book sorely needed writing.My one concern is that while it's necessary to confront the policymakers, real estate developers, lumber and power companies, utilities, etc. with the consequences of what they are doing to California, getting personal by calling them swindlers and idiots has not advanced an environment-based sensitivity on any front. In our anger at unbridled greed and destructiveness we might do well to bear in mind that it's these wanton behaviors we're opposing, not the people who indulge in them. Shaming them won't get us anywhere with healing this damaged planet."
5,Life changer,"I was thrilled to see that this book is still available.I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s and remember it as a game changer. Life changer for many. The combination of aesthetics, environmental concerns and much more made it one of the most important books I ever read. I'm sure it had a major impact on anti-pollution efforts of many kinds in California.Read it and be encouraged!"
2,Nothing new,"Irons tries to argue that the imperial presidency is somehow tied to American imperialism abroad. But he never makes his case; instead, he rants and raves about presidential actions he dislikes while ignoring those which contradict his view.For example, he argues that presidents before Polk all followed to the letter the Constitution's grant of declaring war to Congress - no unilateral presidential war-making. But in fact, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both undertook military actions without the consent of Congress. Is there a difference between those small wars and others? Irons never tells us.Irons doesn't uncover anything new or make any original arguments. Don't buy it."
3,ALPHA DVD VERSION,"THIS ONE WASTES NO TIME. WE'RE ONLY MINUTES INTO MAD MONSTER & WE GET TO SEE THE WEREWOLF TRANSFORMATION!!! GEORGE ZUCCO IS OVER THE TOP RAVING MAD IN HIS QUEST TO CREATE AN ARMY OF WEREWOLVES TO BATTLE NAZIS. THOSE WHO SCOFF & RIDICULE HIM ARE MARKED FOR DEATH. GLENN STRANGE PLAYS THE DIM-WIT TURNED WEREWOLF. HE'S GREAT FUN AS BOTH. SOME PRETTY NASTY POVERTY ROW STUFF HERE IN WHICH A CHILD IS MURDERED BY THE WEREWOLF...STILL, ALL IN ALL, THIS IS ONE LOW BUDGET CLASSIC & AN ENJOYABLE ROMP DOWN MONSTER LANE...RECOMMENDED.THE ALPHA DVD VERSION IS PRETTY POOR THOUGH VISUALLY QUITE CLEAR. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE AUDIO, AN ANNOYING HUMMMM....ON THE SOUNDTRACK THAT DISTRACTS FROM THE OVERALL ENJOYMENT...STILL, FOR THE BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE I'M GLAD I BOUGHT THIS GEM. IT'S MY FAVORITE ZUCCO PERFORMANCE & FOR THAT ALONE A MUST!!!"
1,Not impressed,"This pillow is like a boppy for the bath and it does dry out nicely. However, my daughter is 7 months old and can sit up fine on her own but the pillow tends to make her slide down and it does not keep her upright if she leans forward. Also, it is very difficult to wash the lower half of her body as it is consumed by the pillow. I would return it if I could and find something that provided better support."
3,It's okay.,"It's not a bad product and it works pretty well for us. We bought it initially because my big baby was too large for her baby bathtub but too young to sit up on her own. It filled the developmental gap nicely. It does slip out from the baby so it needs constant readjustment but that's not really a big deal. It's safer than traditional baby bath chairs as there are no pieces to get stuck in or under. My baby loves to lean back on it and relax in the water. My only real complaint is that the stuffing bunches in the wash. All in all, however, it has done a decent job."
3,"Not bad, but not the best of the century","Some good essays here, but a number of boring ones as well, if they had 100 years of essays to choose from, I'm suprised this was the best they could come up with."
2,Not a total loss,"It makes a good background music. Its not the kind of music you turn up to deafen yourself with. Its an ""atmosphere, won't drown out the people"" music."
3,Varied selection.,"Another cd I purchased for only one song, ""Lonesome Vice Magic"", which I first heard in a Geico commercial. The one from a few years ago where the dogs in cars are riding with their heads out the windows. Absolutely love that song. The rest weren't that interesting to me. I'm pretty happy with my purchase all the same. Compilations always a good idea. Helps one diversify.Recieved shipment promptly from seller."
1,ITS A NO NO,Being a fashion photographer( and being the biggest techno/dj music freak)I listened to each song on both cd's and it is not good. The music is terrible and falls into a catagory of music that nobody on the face of this earth would want to listen to. Further more the price is outrageous. Oh and P.S. They dont play music like this at fashion shows!
2,disappointment,"I use exercise DVDs on a frequent basis. When you workout at home, variety is the key to keeping the experience interesting so the formatting of this set interested me. The first DVD is cardio and my first workout with that one was great. The second time I used it, it started skipping and getting stuck. I cleaned it and it got worse. I then tried the others and at first they were fine so I thought the cardio one was just defective but the more I used the others, the more they also stalled. I love the workouts but can not enjoy them."
2,it must have been really hard to make this so boring,"I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't. I was unable to feel connected with any of the characters. Other reviewers have cited Helen's arrogance as a turn-off, but I don't need a likeable protagonist, just a believable one. I realized about half-way through this book that I just didn't care what happened next, so I stopped reading. I rarely fail to finish a book (I've been a really fast reader for most of my life and I'm an insomniac, so I usually read about 500 pages a day). What's funny is that this book wasn't terrible, it was just boring. I've actually finished many a terrible book. I read the entire Dark Jewels trilogy in two days, and those books (though tittilating) feature some of the clunkiest prose and overexplained characters I've ever encountered, but at least they weren't boring. There are too many good historical fiction books out there to waste your time on this one."
2,Memoirs of Helen of Troy,I was very unimpressed about this story. I found it to be very unrealistic and the characters seem boring. Helen seems too perfect and she is not correctly portrayed. Iphigenia was NOT a child of Theseus and Helen but a child of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. It is actually a fact that Queen Leda of Sparta never died when Helen was a young child. She died of shame when Helen ran away with Paris to Troy. The fact that she wrote it in first person is quite dull though the words are vibrant. I didn't find the story historically accurate. The story could've used improvement. I know I wasted a good $23 on it. Hope there is a better book I can sink my teeth into.
1,Bore,This novel was an utter and complete bore. I don't recommend it. The colour of the story is as pale and dull as the colour white. A two-year-old could write better novels.-Iain
1,Helen could write? Who knew!,"""Thus, contained within these pages, is the story of my life, as I write it. As I lived it.""My problems with this book started with these opening sentences in the Prologue.Since the Mycenaeans of that time only used Linear B script to make inventory lists, Helen could not have written the story of her life.But even if she could have done so, she would have written on scrolls - not pages, which weren't invented until the beginning of the Christian era, long after Helen's time. Where were Ms. Elyot's editors?Alas, I wish I could say that things improved after these two gross historical inaccuracies in the very beginning of the book, but I cannot. The book was a disappointment from start to finish. This Helen would never have inspired even a fist-fight, let alone a war."
3,"Good story, little bit of bad writing","I was really excited about this book. I thought she did a good job on the research and painted the story very well. But the writing was pretty bad in some places, either stilted with a lot of parentheticals or just awkward. She also has Helen making wordplay on English words while she speaks ancient Greek. A good story, but I think could have been made a lot more readable with a few more rounds of editing."
3,"""Don't hate me because I'm beautiful!""","that seems to be the overridding theme of Helen's story - she is not a particularly likable protaganist and at times (especially during the battle at Troy) the story dragged. I did like howver, the deft way the author pulled together so much other mythology and merged it into the story seamlessly. I think with a more interesting hero or heroine at the forefront she could write a much better book, but Paris and Helen came across as self-absorbed ""high schoolers in love"" -Hector and Clytemenestra were much more interesting!"
2,Uncleanable placemat,"This placemat is really cute and large enough to fit two bowls, but it doesn't have a smooth surface and has a lot of little grooves and holes so it is not easy to clean."
4,Not THE All-Time Winner,"This is a pretty fair compilation, but, I think they wanted to stretch out the best hits to more than just this first CD. I have Vol II as well. Both are OK, and have a good variety of songs and artists. Check the track list, and you might want this to round out your instrumental collection."
1,This order has been cancelled.,"Ordered the sight, received the notification via email. A few days later checked on my order and on the top of the page was ""This order has been cancelled"". No reason given, no email, nothing!"
4,Good Quality for the price.,I haven't had a chance to use the scope in the filed yet; but it looks and feels to be made of solid quality materials. And I like what I see in regards to the Multi-Reticle optics....Good Quality for the price.
1,Worthless,"I fallowed the instructions, I even used extra wire to help hold the patch to the tailpipe. When I started my Jeep the exhaust blew a hole right through it. The only way I think this product would work is if you used a torch of some kind to warm it up -a lot- before you turn on your vehicle that way the patch is already semi hard."
1,This product is a horrible joke,"I just got back from trying to wrap this around a muffler pipe. The bandage fell apart as soon as I started working with it. I assume that's not the way it's supposed to work, but that's how it did work. By the time I had the thing wrapped around the pipe, it was a mess of tape and backing. It did not hold. The support wire that came with the product was all wrapped up and impossible to untangle and use. What an awful product. I won't be buying it again."
5,A must read for all ages of any gender!,"""The Russians"" series is by far the best historical fiction I have ever read. Judith Pella(and Micheal Phillips in the earlier books) weave a wonderful story of life during the Russian Revolution. These books don't portray an idealistic view of life during this time, but,rather, a very realistic view of what people went through in Russia during the revolution. I reccomend this series to anybody who loves Russian history, romance, intrigue, or just a good cry because this series has it all!"
5,Excellent as always,This novel is as well-written as the first and the storyline keeps the reader interested. Five stars for each book in the seven-part series.
5,great little tool,This slicker is great. It's small so its easy to hold and store. I used it on a shih-poo who almost fell asleep while I was brushing her. It's gentle but gets the job done.
3,Very fine brush not for tough hair,"Currently my dog hates this brush and I can't use it much on her. It pulls her hair like an addition review mentioned on here. It does make here hair very nice when I can get her to let me brush one spot for long enough to get the naughts out (she is a toy poddle) I have know doubt that once I get her hair up to par that this will be a great brush, but if you haven't already been brushing your dogs hair everyday this may not be the brush for you."
4,Perfect size...,I have a 5 lb. Yorkie and this is the only slicker that he'll tolerate. The bristles could be a tad stiffer.Other than that... it's a great lil brush.
5,PERFECT brush for my little dogs!,"I have searched and searched for a brush that won't scratch my little dogs' skin, yet brushes them effectively. We have a toy poodle and a chihuahua / poodle mix, and this brush does a great job on both their thick, beautiful coats:) I am thrilled to have found it, and I'm ordering extras just so we will have them around for a long time. Both dogs actually like it and enjoy being brushed now!"
2,Slicker brush for dogs,"This brush has little white tips, which I think are to protect the skin, but they tangle the hair and it's almost impossible to pull the brush through my poodle's hair because it pulls so badly. I think it might be okay for dogs with shorter hair but not for a poodle or dogs who have hair/fur like poodles. It was also very much smaller than I anticipated even though I knew it was extra small."
2,eh,"its ok. My puppy hates it, she makes me feel like Im doing something wrong when i use this. It pulls on her hair even when I am being super gentle. i dont like it."
2,Seems painful for my yorkipoo,"like the brush but my pup hates it, so even though it brushes her well i can't say I'm going to stick with it. she's a yorkipoo with very soft hair and it was excruciating to he as a puppy, and still seems painful to hear at one year +"
3,Does the Job,"I liked the fit, moved well with me. Realy turned Him on. Hand wash! I would have liked more support but over all ok but I would have paid more for better quality. Price ok for the quality"
2,BRJ 1991,"The articles are primarily interesting and original, however the fact-checking and the editor's introductory material do not rate with the high marks earned by other Journals in the series."
3,Why is this so expensive?,One of the reasons that I love Polly pockets so is because they are affordable. My brother bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter. I thought due to the price it would be some amazing set. It isn't. This should really sell for $10.99. It is definitely not worth the price.
4,Well made but short on flexibility.,"I purchased this exact kit some three years ago. It's well made and I've never found myself wanting more power. In fact, if you can afford it, I would recommend spending more and getting two 1200 packs. This would be more versatile and relates to my only gripe - the energy range. This pack is advertised as having a 6-stop range which is true when you count the max and minimum output. However, when you're shooting asymmetrically at max and need to power down you're only looking at 4 stops available. It would be nice to have another stop and 6 stops would be even better. Unfortunately to get this sort of range requires one of Profoto's more expensive packs. Consequently, the best option would be two 1200 packs."
2,"Outdated, incorrect info","I bought this book expecting a decent read, from all it's good reviews. Instead (in the kindle edition) I found a lot of typos, out-dated and aggressive training techniques, poor photos, and a lot of misinformation; contributing to the myth that the mentally ill are violent, that dogs naturally 'want' to bite people, and promoting NOT using a leash. A lot of the book mentioned things in the most vague, generalized ways, without adequately explaining things. There was some good information, but a lot had to be sifted through for the useful data."
2,Not very helpful,"I was looking for a book that would say how to teach your dog the commands needed to be a certified therapy dog and after skimming the book, it did not look hopeful and when the first chapter basically said, if your dog isn't hungry, food treats don't work for training, I stopped reading because they seem clueless. Even if the dog isn't hungry, the right treat (such as ""training treats"" which my dog LOVES), will motivate them. My girl tends to just eat in the evening but any time of day, and food is a great motivator, as well as love and praise but when they make statements like that, they just seemed ignorant and when it didn't look like it was going to actually give me ideas on how to train her, I put it down. Maybe should be titled, ""Thoughts on Training Your Dog to be a Therapy Dog"" would be appropriate - but this is definitely not a useful book on how to train your dog if that is what you are looking for."
4,Therapy Dogs: Training Your Dog to Reach Others,The book is excellent in pointing out how working a therapy dog is not like other activities with your dog. The author gives many good examples of what the handler must be alert for and how to make the dog's interaction with others comfortable. It is less good in giving step-by-step instructions on exactly how to train the therapy dog. The book will be excellent for someone with good experience in dog training; it is not for the beginner.
5,A Lot of Great Music That Ended Too Soon,"So many people who recall the Drifters think of Ben E. King as the group's first lead singer, but Clyde McPhatter had a number of hits earlier at the helm of the group, some later covered by other major artists (Elvis Presley, ""Such A Night; Dion, ""Ruby Baby"", ""Drip Drop""). Clyde's distinctive voice can also be heard singing backup for Billy Ward and the Dominos on ""Sixty Minute Man"" to name one, before his time with the Drifters. After he went on his own, Clyde made a number of memorable recordings that were commercial hits; they are included on this CD. One I especially liked was ""Ta Ta"" which is easy to sing along with though it is less remembered than others. Clyde McPhatter died tragically young, the newspapers alternately saying he was 39 or 42. His music was part of my formative years and the songs on this CD really carry me back."
4,"Good, thought provoking anime.",A cracking good anime until half way through when it starts repeating itself heavily. I do have to agree with the first reviewer. The case that the five dvds are packaged in is made with some pretty cheap plastic. The tabs that keep the dvds in the case started falling apart on day one. And by day five they were all broken. Invest in some cases to keep these precious dvds safe!
2,It's a book...,What more needs to be said? Buy its here if you need it for a class as it is much cheaper here than in store.
5,Among the best of Cultural Revolution survival memoirs.,The struggle of Liang Heng and his family to endure and survive the insanity of the Cultural Revolution makes for a gripping read. This was one of the first books I read on Maoist China and it remains one of the best.
3,Okay but not great,"I read this book at the suggestion of a friend of mine and found it to be moderately interesting. Liang Heng could have cut a great many of his family stories (I think you had to be there to really enjoy them the way he did). The book could also have used a concise historical overview of China from 1949 to the present day. On the other hand, if you didn't live through the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s or somehow missed it, you might enjoy this book more than I did."
4,A Man's Life in an Revolutionary Period,"This book makes you understand the history of People's Republic of China(PRC) during the revolutionary period.In history, I have learned that the revolution in China was hard but happy for citizens. After reading this book, it wasn't like that after all. I realized that it was different in an individual perspective. It tell how painful it was for the author(Liang Heng) and his family, because they didn't agree to the Communist Party 100%."
3,Book for class,"The book was for my son - it came in great shape. Very pleased with the quality & speed of getting order. Hopefully, he will enjoy reading it - but that's always another story!"
5,Inspiring,"This book is what ""Catcher in the Rye"" is to adolescents in America...and for all backgrounds, its THE novel to read. its so real and current and applicable to one's own life. I feel the struggles of Liang Heng and his family. Its told in a way thats enjoyable yet saddening. His loneliness becomes the reader's loneliness. I read this book while going through a hard time in my life. After reading his story, I had all the strength and willpower to ""struggle"" as if somehow through my struggle I would build charascter and be better for it. I appreciate this book for all it is, says and the reality it created for me. Thank You Liang Heng"
5,great!,"this is my favorite novel ever. the book is of really good quality, clearly printed. i love it so much"
5,Wonderful!!!!,I used to love these cartoons when I was a kid I used to love Casper and all of the Harvey Films characters. I used to watch Casper's cartoons all of the time. I used to love him he was so sweet; But I would always get sad whenever people would be afraid and run away because he was so sweet!!!! I really did used to enjoy Casper and all kinds of other vintage cartoons I enjoy this DVD it takes me down memory lane ; Casper was the best and one of my favorite cartoons!!!!!
1,Did not 'teach' anything at all,"I wish I would have never opened this video so I could send it back! Actors looked bored, unattactive. Mostly video of one particular body part, and odd practices between two women who used plastic wrap between them as protection. I don't believe this video could arouse anybody...If anything it was a total turn off."
2,Not among the best of the Gaither series,"As with most of the videos not recorded in the studio, this session lacks the warmth of the studio recordings. The lighting is not good."
4,A great book even 50 years ago,I read this book 50 years ago in grade school and never forgot the story. I bought it for my 12 year old grand daughter and she said it was very exciting!
5,celestial and stunningly passionate vocal artistry.,Being a singer myself I can identify a genuine voice and Maria [Gal] has that and more.Her singing left me spellbound and a little misty.Why she hasn't received more recognition in North America is a musical 8th wonder of the world.Her voice is as beatiful as she is.This is a general overview whithout going into specifics;all you have to do is listen.Thankyou Gal.P.S.This performance is apparantly available on video; perhaps Amazon can find it.
2,A Big Disappointment,I should have read the description more carefully. I generally do not like live music and this was one of those live CDs. I believe I've listened to it once without much pleasure.
5,The Iceman Stirs the Soul,"Rave all you want; Jerry Butler never got the respect that he deserved in record sales. ""Moon River"" got eclipsed shortly after its release by Andy Williams' version. ""Let it Be Me"" (with the talented Betty Everett) never sold like the Everly Brothers' version. Tony Orlando and Dawn would steal the thunder of ""He Will Break Your Heart"" with ""He Don't Love You like I love You"", though some years later. The Walker Brothers copied every nuance of Jerry's ""Make it Easy On Yourself"" and Elvis Presley, forgetting his own legacy and during his ""singing-other-people's-hits"" period, released ""Only the Strong Survive"" about the same time as Jerry Butler's. (Nice try, fella). With this CD, you can hear the real thing. This is a collector's item. And I hope Jerry Butler sees some profit from its sale."
4,"Great Information, I got my first cleaning job in a matter of days!!","This is a great book. Very Imformative. After following some of the guidlelines set out in the book, I landed my first cleaning job in just a matter of days. Well worth the money. Take the time to read this one if you are thinking of starting your own cleaning business."
5,All you'll need to know,"This book was so very helpful with starting my home-based house cleaning business. I new absolutely nothing about the business requirements or how to make myself a ""professional"" company. I was able to start up and get new clients within a month (with great help from my husband). I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in starting their own cleaning business."
3,For Anyone Without Common Sense,"I was pretty disappointed upon reading this book after reading such awesome reviews here. The book lacked detail and the necessary info to start a successful cleaning service. It listed information that was pretty much common sense and the rest was simply based off one of the author's personal experience. For example, it listed LLC's as being complicated and not the best idea for this type of business. Anyone who would like to cover themselves and their personal assets in the eent of a lawsuit should definitely think of forming an LLC for this business. The book also had many grammatical and spelling errors."
2,a place to start,"I don't like giving a poor review, but this is sort of basic, and there is nothing wrong with a basic book, but on cleaning?I mean, it is a sort of basic business, its not that its hard, its that no one wants to do it - that is the success principle of the cleaning business.I can really recommend this book on the subject, its VERY good and anyone fighting the recession will win big if they follow this one book:Mopping Up Millions!: Making A Killing In Cleaning -Get busy and make some money!"
5,An Entertaining and Provocative Memoir,"While I disagree with a fundamental premise argued in the book, I do recommend it for many reasons. First of all, the author can write! She has filled the book with interesting and unusual experiences, described them with wit as well as passion, and she challenges people like me on some basic assumptions and conclusions. I do hope readers of this book will follow up with Peter Singer's Writings on an Ethical Life (referred to in Harriet Johnson's book) in order to hear Singer's opinions in his own words."
4,Pleasant Nostalgia,"This recording of Jane Morgan's most memorable songs gives one unfamiliar with this artist, under-rated and little-remembered in America, a look back to a time when artists sang easily understood lyrics in straightforward arrangements.I knew Miss Morgan and her new husband, Jerry Weintraub, in London in the late 1960s, so it is especially wonderful for me to hear her sing again. I also bought a copy of this CD for a friend who remembered her but who hadn't heard her sing in many years. He is thrilled with it."
4,Wonderful Songs from a Wonderful Voice,"This CD includes her best-sellers and most requested recordings.""Till"" and ""Two Different Worlds"" are my favorites. ""Fascination"" is a classic. Her version of ""Moon River"" is the best version I have heard. A great singer--there should be a volume 2 with ""Love Makes the World Go 'Round"" and""What Now My Love"". Both songs were singles that did well on the charts in the New York City area in the early 60s."
4,No one like her,"With her creamy voice and absolute lack of any sense of beat or rhythm, Jane Morgan made every song she sang whipped cream. She did do one brilliant album, ""What Now My Love"" (her take on ""Only the Lonely"") and one big hit album of covers ""Fresh Flavor"" but most of what she recorded spins out like cotton candy. Yet her years in France are also revealed in the Continental sense of her stylings and she's always on key and has faultless intonation. In other words, she's a singer of contradictions, and all the more fascinating for it. There's no one like her, so this album is well worth getting."
1,Worst product I've ever bought,"Hands down, this is the worst product I've ever purchased. The only thing it manages to do properly is put a hole in the cork. If this is all you want, then you're in luck. If you want the cork to actually *come out of the bottle*, go buy something else.Now that I've been to other web sites and read reviews, I see that there are really mixed reviews on this particular product (I bought it when there were no reviews to be had). Apparently they must have a real quality issue with either design or manufacturing. In the end: If you buy this item, you might get a working one, or you might not. How lucky are you feeling today?"
2,"Well, it does work...","Bought this as a gift for someone, so I didn't have a chance to test it out until the day of giving the gift. After the person opened the gift, we tried it out on a bottle and sure enough, it did work. It's not the easiest thing to operate because you have to pierce the cork with the needle (hidden inside the handle) so that the gas can enter the bottle and force the cork out. I can't knock the product for not working but I still think a traditional bottle opener is easier and more reliable to use. I doubt the person I gave the gift to use still using it and honestly, I don't believe the thing has enough stored gas in it to open more than a few bottles, although they claim 40 bottles (replacement cartridges are easy to find at a hardware store)."
1,"Worked, for a day...","I bought this for my father at Christmas this past year. When he opened it we immediately popped two bottles of wine, wow, it worked great and was really slick! After that, my dad didn't have another bottle of wine for about a month, at which point he needed to open about 20 bottles for an event. He was stoked because this would surely make it easy! Well, he tried about 5 bottles and each failed to op the cork more than halfway out. Wow disappointment! Our guess is that the seal between the device and the CO2 cartridge is cheap and the CO2 slowly leaked out. Maybe this would be great if you wanted to drink 50 bottles of wine and use a full cylinder, or if you had a new cartridge every time you opened a bottle after a few days... Great concept, poor execution."
1,You'll die of thirst before this opens your wine.,Bought one of these as a gift and haven't been able to get it to successfully work even once. Does anyone have any tips for making this functional or is it just a poorly made product?
4,Sweet!!,"I've read other books by Carolyn Davidson, and this was not her best, BUT!!!, it was really good. If your in the mood for a love story that is really sweet, this one is for you. Heroine has had a hard past, hero is tender. Parts of the story line were a bit too drawn out for me, but otherwise a really nice, entertaining read."
5,Loved it!,"I enjoyed this book very much. I've read several books by this author and have liked every one of them. Her characters are believable, her love scenes true to life (not physically impossible or unlikely like many romance novels) and her prose is easy to follow. I rarely have to re-read anything. Her descriptions of life and setting make you feel like you were there, and, in the case of those who feel we were born a century too late, make us wish we were."
4,Very good introduction to the history of theology,"I had this book for a history of Christian theology class I took last year, and I found it to be very helpful. I agree with most of the criticisms that the a previous reviewer made: he is rather biased in some areas and makes some rather unfortunate mistakes in places. However, I am not aware of a book that is a better deep introduction than this one, so until one comes along I am inclined to give Olson credit for making at least a decent one. There are plenty of very brief overviews (I recommend Mark Noll's Turning Points), but this is the only half-way decent detailed introduction to Christian theology that I am aware of. It may not be perfect, but it is far better than nothing. Just be aware while reading it that he is not necessarily objective in some of his claims.Overall grade: B+"
4,Good Place to Start,"This is a great book for anyone beginning in church history/historical theology. This one one textbook I had in a college class, and it was a great help. Olsen stated in the opening of the book that it would be very shallow for some who have studied historical theology, and too deep for some who have not had any exposure to it. If you are interested in this subject, which is actually very important in many ways, then you would have a hard time finding a better place to START. This would be a bad book to end with, however."
2,Look elsewhere,"Simplistic and unbalanced. Olson lingers over certain details then hurries over major figures, often distorting their theology with his simplistic categories. Those interested in the history of theology are much better served by Justo Gonzalez's History of Christian Thought (accessible and about the same length as Olson) or Jaroslav Pelikan's amazing 5-volume The Christian Tradition: History of the Development of Doctrine (more advanced but well-written)."
3,"what this book tries to do, can it be done anyway?","I agree with the low scorers of this book that it is way too simplifying issues throughout and also that it is often contradictory. A point not really touched is that it is very much from an evangelical perspective. This means the author doesn't do efforts to ponder the issues he sees as less relevant for evangelicalism. The 10 to 15 th century are awfully treated, far less informed than an average first grader from Europe. About simplifying I'd say that's always the case if you want 2000 years (minus some important virtually neglected centuries) of doctrinal issues to be told simply. Now the narrative approach does help, but the bottomline is: do we really want books to do what this book tries to do or do we agree that you have to choose between a very simple small introduction volume and a polyvolume series."
2,Good for one use only,"After one use, the gel slides off the patch. Reapplication after that causes that tingling feeling as it is not sticking properly"
5,"good product, but lost in mail","The product is great...no problems at all with the product but once my order did not arrive week after week, I finally called the mfr and they were nice enough to quickly ship out another package. All in all, the company was great to work with, but frustratiing having to wait so long initially."
2,tears easily,"These electrodes are of fairly poor quality. Especially as they are made to be reusable. The outer foam surface tears easily (at the smallest tug of the lead wires) and the electrodes can't be used again.Will last for a a few uses, but at least one or two out of the package tears and needs to be thrown away after a few days. Luckily the order came with 16 pads as several have already been ripped after only ordering these 2 weeks ago.Electrodes with a woven ""premium"" fabric are MUCH more durable."
2,Stiff,"I use these on a Koalaty TENS unit. They must fit on very rounded, sharp body parts (elbow, shoulder AC joint, thumb base). They are very stiff and inflexible. They work fine on large, flat body parts such as lower back.I'd suggest buying a different brand/style if you want flexible pads. Pads made of a fabric backing, much like the better style of band-aids, work better on small, very rounded body parts."
4,Good electrodes,Electrodes work fine with my Empi TENS unit. They were shipped quickly with good communication from Austin Medical Equipment.
4,Better than most,First time I tried these and they conduct better than most others that are fabric or cloth covered. Feel better and don't get caught on clothes like others do since they are foam backed. Sticky lasts about the same as most others I have tried. Will for sure buy these again.
5,good product,I got this product when I got my TENS unit. The pads work really great. I highly recommend this product.
4,TENS Unit Pads,"We're pretty pleased. Wish they would stick a little longer as we get about 4 uses per pad. Or... since we both use the unit... 4 pads last about a week between the 2 of us. If it were just one... 4 pads would last about 2 weeks.The key for better adhesion... take a cool wet cloth and wipe down the area where you'll use the pads... but let dry thoroughly. Oily skin will kill the pad. 1 shot and done. So clean, clean, clean first.We're happy enough we've ordered 3 times now and will keep ordering going forward."
5,Wonderful Product! Great Company!,It is so expensive to go through the companies that sell you your TENS units. These pads are better made than the ones that came with my TENS unit. I will def order from this company again.
2,They work but they don't last,"I bought those as replacement for the original that came with my EMS 7500. The original lasted a long time and I was expecting the same time of quality.They work as the original, no complain there, they stick to your body but after just a few uses, you feel the glue is loosing its grip. I mean usage like after 4 times it is feeling loose.I am on my last package but I won't even considerer this to buy again. Quality of construction is good, they don't rip, you feel the full electricity going thru but the glue is the problem."
2,"OK, but not long lasting","I was disappointed with this product because they lost their stickiness fairly quickly. I took good care of them and sealed them up right away when I finished with them, rehydrated them, too, but they just would not stay on! When they stuck, they worked."
5,Well made and a good fit!,"I have a herniated disc in my back that flares up from time to time and therefore, have a tens unit. These electrodes are a tight, secure fit into the tens units leads and they stick well to my back, even when I sweat. Definitely reusable and a great deal. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for this type of item!"
2,"They work, but leave a rash!","The stickiness of these is not great; you'll probably just be able to use them once. However, don't try these if your skin is sensitive or if you have allergies: My experience is that they will leave a bumpy, itchy rash."
1,VERY displeased.,"What's to say? I bought some extra pads to go with the ones that came with my TENS unit. The oem pads are still going fairly well after a dozen or more uses each while almost every one of these pads failed after the first use. The glue is extremely strong and it peels off of the electrode - staying on the skin instead. Two pads out of the sixteen were good for a second use and will probably be OK for a third time as well but this is just too high a failure rate to recommend the product. I will NOT buy any more of them, although I'd certainly buy from the same company if they sell different pads.I should've read the other reviews before ordering because this seems to be a common complaint with these pads."
4,Good Stim Pads,"These electrode stim pads vary a great deal in price. I feel these pads meet the quality standard for the price. I use them frequently on my back for 2 herniated discs that I have. Of course, you could place them anywhere. Good product for the money....dont spend your money on the real expensive ones...they all wear off and become non-adhesive to your skin after a while. I will buy these again! ;)"
4,not used,"havent used them yet but they look very good , still using the other pads but from what i see they are the ones the phisical therapist used ."
2,Sauce Boat,This was definately not what I was expecting. It is way too small to be of any use for a holiday meal. Might work as a milk pitcher for cereal for brakfast. But it does match my pattern nicely. Way too expensive for the size.
5,Now you can sing along with Buffy!,"Any Buffy fans out there as disappointed as I was when the show ended has to have this script book for one the best Buffy episodes ever. Anyone who likes singing and dancing and demons together will love this. The entire scipt of the episode ""Once More with Feeling"" along with the music and lyrics of all the songs. Insider info from Joss starts the book along with pictures from the making of the episode. You know you want to sing along with Buffy and the gang and now you can!"
4,A Bit Disapointed ...,"I was a bit disapointed when I bought this script book and I flipped through the pages. I realize that there is only one episode in this scriptbook (and thats fine) but when I watched the episode half of the script that was in my book was wrong. And I Know this is the original script book but I really couldn't follow along. However, I do prefer the original script better then the actual episode script.In addition to the episode script there is sheet music for those of you who like to follow along the notes and sing and actually for those of you who play an instrument and want to learn how to play a Buffy song! (Very cool.)Also, there are pictures. Not alot but still a couple of pages. They are colored pictures and are decorated with quotes from the episode. Interesting and fun to look at.Overall: A good buy. However, a better buy for those of you who like singing/playing instruments... because half of the book is sheet music!Alright!! Now all you need is the Cd! :)"
1,Disappointing!,"I was looking for inspiration on creativity following loss, but this relatively small and very personal collection of poems was not it at all. Very disappointing, especially if you pay for the hardcover!"
4,Easiest to use,"We had the other style fence with the wire ""in ground"", but at our current house that was going to be a difficult install (cross a driveway etc.) plus it would not be easy to move/adjust the location if it did not work out. This unit solves that. As long as the site for the base unit (in the house) is not below grade ( the signal is blocked by dense objects like the ground - duh) and your yard area is fairly flat this unit works perfectly. A dial allows adjustment for the range (roughly a circle around the unit. The collar eats batteries - my only minor issue, wish we had a rechargeable one."
5,Excellent Product,"I've used the Pet Safe Wireless Fence for over 10 yrs. I just purchased an extra transmitter to use at our cottage. It has kept my dogs from wandering and being a nuisance to neighbours, as well as keeping them safe and giving them freedom to roam around the property without being tied up. The key is to follow the instructions and training as suggested in the owner's manual. We've used it on our Alaskan Malamute as well as our Border Collie."
1,Wont work,"First off, i order the outdoor model, which they shipped me the if100. I contacted amazon, and was going to send the item back. Then i contacted PetSafe technical support, who stated, as long as it was kept out of the elements (which it will be, just not in the house) would be ok. So, dumb me, did not sent back. I should have known when the controls where in different language, and there was no instruction book, this was a bad unit. Which it is. I just place my replacement request, i will keep you posted on how that goes. I do not have a good feeling about this at all........"
4,Pet Smart Wireless Fence,"I have used one of these invisible fencing for over 3 years with GREAT success. It allows the dogs freedom of our yard without the need of a physical fence. Other than a lighting hit on my orginal transmitter box (the reason I purchased a 2nd box) I have had No problems this set up. It is simple to use, just plug and go...."
5,Life Dog Saver!,We recently purchased a fishing camp. I can't imagine not owning it! Our dogs were almost hit by a truck before we bought it. Now it keeps them in a safety zone. I recommend purchasing a lot of extra batteries. I personally would only buy it for traveling or for short-term uses (like a weekend place). Make sure the collar is turned on properly (I thought I had a defective one). The only down side- I've had to buy 3 extra collars for our kids dogs when they come down to go fishing- OUCH $$$$$$$$ but they are ALL safe! LOVE my DOGS way to much to risk their safety.
4,Good Easy Solution for Pet Containment,"I have had two of these units for six months, having ordered a second one when I discovered our yard shape and size required two units with an overlapping pattern. This is so much better than our in ground wire fence that was impossible to maintain. Our two Weimaraners learned the system in a day and have not escaped once. I wish the batteries were not integrated in the cap design as they cost more as branded items. The controls are a little hard to reach on the transmitters; but very reliable technology. Set up is trickier for sloped yards, but I had it up and going in about 3 hours of trial and error. The ability to put two transmitters in to accommodate a peanut shaped yard is impressive. The collar settings and signals seem to work well with the way dogs think, and are lightweight, non pokey. I don't even need the shocker prongs anymore (just warning signal) but you can't remove the prongs without the collar falling apart."
3,Sorry - Trilby looks better on the photo than in person,"Trilby had to be returned - it's cute, but the color is just not nice - dull and bleak and dark - no intense teal-blue or red like in the picture. Trilby looks much better on the photo than in person. A very sorry looking toy."
1,"""BEHOLD A PALE HORSE""","Although this is a great classic film, my low rating refers not to the film, but to the ""Columbia Tri-Star"" DVD re-issue.First of all this copy is too dark to the point where at the beginning of it you cannot even see the faces and features of the actors. Its like its always night in that version. Very poor quality. Also I think it was totally unnecessary to re-issue it in widescreen only. This is a 1964 black and white film, so it should have been re-issued in its original full screen form or give the buyer an option of widescreen and full screen. But the dark tone is too much and in my opinion ruins the film which was a great film based on a great story about the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and the arch-rivalry between a guerilla fighter and a Captain in Franco's Guardia Civil."
2,Much too dark and grainy,"Cannot view film very well, very grainy and dark. I love Black and White but this is awful. Don't buy"
2,"FRED ZINNEMANN, OPUS 19","I've always been fond of unsuccessful movies, I dont' know why. Maybe because, unconsciously, I see the beauty of the film that could have been shot instead. TakeBehold a Pale Horsefor instance. When you see it, you can already feel the nostalgy that will emanate from Zinnemann's last movieFive Days One Summershot 18 years later, you can also foresee in the final scene of the shooting, the great last scene ofThe Day of the Jackal. I also love the idea that underliesBehold a Pale Horsethat is the final return to the Mother, to the Mother Country. Now, as a whole, the film didn't work for me. Perhaps, it will for you. Already forgotten."
4,Buy it for the Star Power,"Like most movies made for a political purpose, ""Behold a Pale Horse"" looks a bit better on paper than on the screen. Truly, the assemblage of talent is breathtaking, many of the participants having worked together on the blockbuster ""Lawrence of Arabia"" two years earlier: actors Quinn, Sharif, Zia Mohyedin, and Maurice Jarre who did the musical score. To this add director Fred Zinnemann and lead actor Gregory Peck. But there the problems start. Peck, of known leftist sympathies, clearly wanted to do the film but is less than convincing as a European. The pacing is often tedious--is this the same director who did ""Day of the Jackal""?--the script full of preposterous coincidences. On the credit side, the local backgrounds in Spain and France are dead accurate. Knife-edge work by Quinn as the corruptible but determined Captain of the Guardia Civil and as his suave lieutenant the French actor Christian Marquand in a masterfully understated performance."
2,Not worth watching,"The Movie, The Pale Horse, was very challenging to follow. It had many characters and situations that it made me loose track of who was who. To me the ending was very disappointing and I wish it was different."
5,One of the VERY BEST family films I've EVER seen!!!,"This new fully restored DVD release of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" was the first time I had ever seen this Romeo Muller story, and what a gem it is!!! It has all the charm and fancy of ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"", ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"", ""Frosty the Snowman"", ""Puff the Magic Dragon"", and some of his other better stories. The originality and imagination put into this story is beyond belief! It is beyond belief because it has not become a widely loved piece of entertainment. It is a shame that the other episodes in this TV series were never produced. Given how well this one turned out the other stories in this anthology series would most likely have been of equal stature. You'll be doing your family a dis-service to your family if you do not add this film to your library."
2,Much much darker than described,"The marker must have been in inventory for a long time because it was a bit dried out and didn't work properly. When it did work, it was inconsistent, and even worse, it was NOT a light wood color at all. It was more of a dark walnut color. So disappointed. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it arrived on time."
4,Compelling on several levels,"Most of the lyrics are deppressing... mostly about the workings of the brain/chemical relationship. Obviously where the title comes from. The CD starts out with mellow acoustic guitars and voice... and then just zooms out into left-field after that. Though there are a lot of texture noises in the songs all the tracks still keep a melodic nature. The songs that Jarboe (x-Swans) sings on are extraordinarily un-nerving and just downright scary... but also, somehow very pretty. I don't know if that makes any sense, you'll just have to hear for yourself. The cover of ""Mutiny in Heaven"" by the Birthday Party (Nick Caves' old band) is very cool."
5,Kennedy Center Homecoming,"Without a doubt, this is the best! The quality of the music and performance is wonderful. I have watched this video many times and still sit on the edge of my chair through-out."
4,"Kennedy Center Homecoming, Bill & Gloria Gaither",A fantastic collection of inspirational songs by the Gaither Homecoming Friends. I have over 75 0f the Gaither videos and I would rate this one in the top 10.
4,Good Stuff,"I picked this item up not from Amazon, but from Bodisque in Amsterdam, as a 12"" vinyl recording. This version contains three tracks; Enuff, 3 Freaks and Enuff (instrumental). It's perfect for parties because it has very snappy lyrics and a groovy beat, while the instrumental gives the chance to play. 3 Freaks is perfect for parties as well, because of it's hyphy roots and Shadow's blistering interpretation of the Bay Area scene's newest sound. Well worth the price."
1,absurd attempt to make Lizzie look innocent,"Ed McBain tries to turn the story of lizzie borden into a fiction with his many speculations. quite irresponsible nonfiction documentary. Stick to the bare facts, sir! They speak for themselves."
2,Not for me.,"I too found that this book focuses way too much on how great Tom Monahan is, how to read the book and how proud he is of the names for his creativity excersises. It's distracting. He put the mashed potatoes all over the top of the meat.After reading half of this book, out of order (which he encourages), I was disappointed. I didn't feel like I was learning anything new. But then I realized that I am not the target. This book is not for people who are already advertising creatives. This book would be great if you're someone who wants to get into the creative department, or if you are in a non-creative industry and you want to learn how to come up with innovative ideas. But for me, he's just telling me about what I do every day.I don't know everything. I'm no Tom Monahan. But I was expecting ""Hey Whipple"" and I got ""Hey Arnold"" -- Good. Just not geared towards me."
1,Done with books on creative thinking,"This is the fourth or fifth book on creative thinking I've read that tries to mimic the classic ""Thinkertoys"" in some fashion or other. Through buying and reading books of this type and learning nothing new."
1,ABSOLUTELY MISLEADING.,"I was very disappointed about the contents of this book upon discovering it. I was in the process of researching pre-anesthetic surgery and I was actually interested in the methods of how one would preform an actual lobotomy on oneself. Little did I know that instead of learning how to sever the connections to my prefrontal cortex, I instead figured a way to open my mind ( to my disappointment, not literally). I have no need for creativity, only self operation on my brain. Though I do see need for such literature, I have no use for it and will find my needed information elsewhere. Thank you for your time and hopefully in the future, you will aptly name your books."
1,Waste of my money,I had to purchase this particular book for one of my college design classes since it was not available at our campus bookstore. It was a WASTE of my money and time to buy this book! My professor at the time was a weird guy and he pulled out some of the activities out of the book to use during class. Turns out that no one used the book either. It was a real BORE... and I couldn't sell it anywhere after the quarter ended. So I gave it to my 15 year old brother in hopes he would enjoy it more than I did.
4,Where's the Big Idea? A review in 45 words.,"Authored by a repeatedly self-described creative genius, this looks at how new ideas build businesses and how you can use his service marked techniques to do it too. No great ideas, but the section on how to present work is worth the price (when discounted). (45)I'd try ""Cracking Creativity"" first for great techniques."
1,Don't Bother!,"I'd give it 0 stars, but you have to select at least one for the review to process.Save your money ... don't fall victim to this worthless waste of time. Poorly shot ... uninformative and un-arousing. Dr. Suzy sits on a bed ""babbling"" for the entirety of the video with various grainy video clips occasionally fading in and out. Watches like a badly produced home movie. Its a shame that this is the only foot fetish related video Amazon has to offer. The video boasts that ""if you don't have a foot fetish prior to watching, you will when its over"". Well, I'm here to say that the only condition you'll develop is narcolepsy. This one earns a big ""BOOO-HISSSSSS"""
2,Lacks clarity,"The author talks about all major developments in the field of Quantum Physics as of the date the book was published, but does not explain them clearly, especially towards the end with topics such as super gravity. The diagrams appear out of sync with the text, and are not explained well. I somewhat liked the book in the begining, but at the end was forcing myself to finish it."
5,Quantum is not equal to hard,"One of the greater difficulties that a scientist, teacher or scientific writer has is to explain to a common person in simple words the theories and the findings of the modern physics by using his/her own language (particularly, quantum physics is barely understood even in Physics graduates). Gribbin succeeds in it, by using examples understandable to most people and taking a straight course to reality."
4,In Search of Schrodinger's Cat,A great introduction to the bizarre world of quantum mechanics. The first two sections provide a bit of history and framework preparing the reader to be kicked off the deep end in the remainder of the book. The long bibliography at the end provides an excellent source of further reading material. Read this book before reading Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality.
3,"A good read, but it has its flaws","A wonderful book for beginners interested in the history of the development and basic understanding of quantum physics. However, I found it somewhat dry at times, particularly in regards to the development of the many stages of quantum physics. Overall a decent book."
4,It will raise your IQ,"This book is not an easy read, but it's a worthwhile one. Gribbins is a good writer and does an excellent job getting the reader up to speed on modern physics by taking a whirlwind tour of 20th century discoveries. Every once in a while, he'd lose me, but then I'd catch up. If you're in the mood for an excellent scientific lesson, you won't be disappointed. For the record I found Hawking a more lucid science writer, but Gribbin is still quite good."
4,The development of Quantum Mechanics,"This book gives an organized picture of the development of quantum theory and how the pieces fit together. John Gribbin gives an interesting description of how quantum theory evolved as well as how the notion of reality itself had to be rethought. The book leaves you with an open end - which is where John Gribbin's ""Schrodinger's Kittens"" starts of.I think this is one of the first books you should read, when starting your way into Quantum Mechanics."
5,Reality Disproved,"When Gribbens first wrote that his book would cast doubts on to reality, I thought he was right: Explaining Quantum physics so that a non-scientist can understand it should be impossible. I was happy to be proven wrong by this informative read. I strongly reccomend it to anyone with an intenrest in Science. Students at the lower levels of physics are chemistry might also find this helpful. Even if you are not interested in Science, you will find that this book changes your world view fairly radically. It will destroy any fatalistic, predetermined views in any open minded indivual."
4,To Be or Not to Be,"Is the universe, according to quantum physics, the result of our observations? The question is most certainly an oversimplification, but the principle is not too far from what John Gribbin writes about in, ""In Search of Shrodinger's Cat.""This is not an easy read, nor is it the most energetic science book that this reader has ever read. Gribbin writes the book in a straight narrative that is, at times, a bit monotonous. Nonetheless, the subject matter is mind opening. The read requires discipline, and a bit of patience at times. Every so often, though, Gribbin shares a jewel with the reader--something accessible (in a confusing sort of quantum way), enlightening, and truly exciting. The subject matter, especially for a science enthusiasts, is hard to pass up.""The End of Physics: The Myth of a Unified Theory"", by David Lindley, as well as ""Einstein's Universe"", by Nigel Calder, are also great reads."
2,Too Long Winded.,I bought the Cat book as well as the kitten book. Mr. Gribbin starts out well for one half of the cat book. He then drifts into other areas which I suppose have a connection to the subject. The second half of the book did not hold my attention; did not show me anything I could use. It resulted in my not reading the kitty book. I would recommend a do not buy order and instead try something else. I looked at other reviews and see I am the only one with a not so positive review. I was not happy with my purchase.Jimmy
2,poor,"This book is alright if youd like to hear about what scientist rushed into the other ones office screaming. Or the life of Dr. Planck, and three hours later find out what the planck length is and what it,s used for. i personally want the facts and the information about the interesting subject that they use as their title. Not the history of why a world class scientist killed himself. To sum up it's a great book if you want a biography with the interesting stuff strewn about in many places so you have to search. although if you like a historical book then you may find it interesting."
2,"Confusing, verbose, and over-stuffed","Gribbin's account of the Copenhagen interpretation is disjointed and unclear, and he tries to explain too many items of quantum exotica in too few pages. On the plus side, there are clear accounts of the ""Many World's"" interpretation, and the early history of Quantum Mechanics. His latest book devoted to Quantum Mechanics is ""Q is for Quantum"", which is a great improvement on this book."
3,"Good, but not great.","I had great enthusiasm going into this book, but I must say I was let down. I had read Gribbin's ""Unveiling the Edge of Time"" (a GREAT read, in my opinion) and expected more of the same in this book only with more emphasis on quantum mechanics. Well, it definately had the QM, but that same style just wasn't there. It had lots of interesting stuff, but somehow just failed to ""make me wonder about the possibilities"" like the other book."
4,In Search of Schrodinger's Cat,"An excellent development of the history of quantum mechanics. For the lay person who wants to learn something about the debate regarding the particle versus wave nature of light and elementary particles, this would be a good way to get a general understanding. The discussion gets rather ""out there"" toward the end, but the arguments are all tied up and summarized nicely. I wish this book had been around when I took physical chemistry!"
5,the cat ate my homework,"I haven't read many books in the last few years but this one stands out. I managed to read the whole thing from cover to cover. I took the advice of another reviewer and read ""Alice in Quantumland"" first. I don't think it matters though in what order you read them. They are both good introductions for a layperson interested in this fascinating subject. And it was Stephen Hawkin's ""Short History of Time"" which got me started in wanting to know more about quantum physics. The ""Alice"" book is very good at explaining the basic concepts. ""Schrodinger's Cat"" gives an excellent historical account of how the theory evolved, explaining the concepts as it goes. Gribbin seems to have an excellent understanding of the subject matter and tells a great story."
4,A Great Introduction to Quantum Mechanics,"I read this way back during my college years (1994-98). It was the first time I read a popular science book on quantum mechanics and cosmology (my first popular science book was Carl Sagan's magnificent treatise on science, ""A Demon-Haunted World""). I just happened to see it in the library. You could say the title caught my attention. I remember the cover was so worn out already. But am I glad I saw it! Ever since then, I've been hooked to the field and wondered why I took a different college course. This book made me interested in physics!"
5,The Master and Ruler of the World!,This was a great tape. It was short only running about an hour but it's nice to see Sid get his own tape. One of the overlooked wrestling stars of the 90's. I hope WWE will produce a best of Sid dvd in the future. In this tape you get clips of his matches from his debut to Fall Brawl 1999. You get to hear from the man himself out of character.
5,Excellent seller,"Book received was just as described, received very quickly. Excellent. Would use this seller again."
5,rocks so hard,"this album shouts, screams, and calms. After listening to this album from beginning to end, I felt like i whirlwinned around in a tornado. The video for ""Shh.."" is awesome and the boys can really rock out live, their energy is amazing and their sound is distinctly like nothing that other big rock bands put out. My other favorites are ""bullshed"" and ""bravo."" this album is an awesome rock investment."
4,You Gotta Hear This One....,"When I first bought this album, it was by mistake. I was looking for another band with Apex in the title and, with many cups of coffee in me, I purchased this one. Boy was I suprised! This band rocks house plain and simple. The influence of Don Gilmore, the producer of such greats as Pearl Jam and Linkin Park, can be heard all over this one as his strong hand and Andy Khachaturian, lead voicals, mix very well together.Each track is different and there is enough for everyone on this disc with such rockin' songs as track 4-Shhhh...(Hope Diggy) strong, System of a Down-like lyrics to the Incubus-like track 7-That's All; this album has it all. I would like to take a sec to give the nod to track 8-Bravo as well, as it is one were the bands musical style changes the most. They go from semi-hard to thrash confortabley, a true selling point if you are a music fan. This album is a ""MUST HAVE"" album for any collection."
1,Angry Drivel,"On their debut album Topsy-Turvy, The Apex Theory want to expose society's double standards and create an ideal world, yada yada yada. On ""Add Mission"", the first track, they ask for ""the chance for saying our side"". Over the course of twelve metal-cum-Mediterranean cuts, singer-guitarist Andy Khachaturian spews his angry drivel. ""Much wasn't real amidst hierarchy fields"", ""rough mouth fits make you calm"" - what?!! Is Natalie Merchant ghostwriting for nu-metal bands? The closest Apex Theory come to an articulate political thought is ""nationalism is rising""; prescient, sure, just not that deep. Which leaves us with their music - manic, like their Armenian brethren System of a Down; steeped in middle eastern rhythms, with electric guitar doubling for the oud; passionate - what'd you expect?, they're very young. Yet what does it bode when the most exotic riff, the opening to ""Mucus Shifters"", isn't lifted from Armenia but Haircut 100's ""Love Plus One""?"
5,In a Class by Itself,"Topsy-Turvy is one of the best albums I've bought in a very long time! It's one of those cds you can just put in and listen to the whole thing without having to skip over any songs. Albums like that are very rare. The Apex Theory has a very unique, very distinct sound that I can appreciate. I have many Bosnian and Armenian friends, including my boyfriend, and the music they listen to is fundamentally similar to the songs on Topsy-Turvy. If you've ever heard traditional music from the region of the world from which 3 of the 4 members of The Apex Theory came, you can appreciate their unparallelled music even more. This is an awesome cd, definitely a refreshing wild ride through various genres. I encourage rock fans to buy it."
5,Good DVD Box,The DVD box is great. The only thing that caught me off was the fact that they switched the order of how the disks were placed in the box. It is still great though.
5,Great Experience,"Came very quickly, Great quality, bought as a present for my friends birthday, so I don't know what the disc's look like but since it is wrapped and has no scratches on the box I assume they are perfectly fine. Great experience :D"
5,Paloma's review of Mole's Hill,"There are four character in this story. They are Mole, Fox, raccoon and skunk. Mole digging annoys fox, racoon and skunk. Fox says she has to stop digging and move when the maple leaves turn red and orange. Mole doesn't want to move and she gets an idea. So when raccoon and skunk come to check if she is getting ready to move they're in for a big surprise.I liked this because it has beautiful picture they look like they are made out of ribbons with little black dots on them. My favorite character is Mole because she has a smart mind and great ideas."
3,book is fine,Trouble with books is that sometimes it is difficult to tell if they are hardback or paperback even if you read through all the stuff. This is especially true it you are ordering through another seller other than Amazon.
5,Aw Yeah.,"If you like pinball, (works on the 360) then this game is for you! My original was so good one of my guests stole it a few years ago, and never fessed up to it. They were kind enough to leave the case, so I used my Android Amazon Barcode scanner, and found it for cheap! I was stoked!"
1,This is a substandard product. Pass on it.,"I bought this and found that if you like to burn your own CD's to play in it, it has a problem reading the tracks. It sometimes spins up and doesn't play, and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find. I usually wake to that sound before the music starts. I AM NOT A LIGHT SLEEPER. This is my second one, and I've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months. Do yourself a favor and find a different product."
1,Do not repeat DO NOT waste your money,"This might just be the all-time most useless piece of electronics I've ever purchased. CD tracks are either skipped over or hang entirely, radio can't even pick up local transmitters. One thing that does reliably work is the alarm itself, but that's not much good if it can't tune anything in nor get the first track on the CD cued up. Massive disappointment. DO NOT BUY."
1,Poor quality...steer clear,"This product didn't work on the CD function for the alarm from day one. I mistakenly thought that the alarm was only supposed to work on radio. But after 6 months, the CD function wouldn't work at all. It stops playing and gets stuck at a particular part like the old record players used to. The warranty is only 3 months and Philips refused to replace saying, essentially, that they only warrant that their product will work for 3 months."
1,Disposable clock radio,"I liked this clock radio when we first bought it because of the feature of being able to wake up to a cd. But after less then a year, here I am trying to find a new one. One morning the power came on, but no music, the cd was spinning. None of the buttons would work, power wouldn't shut off so I unplugged it. Tried again the next day, and it completly shut off in the middle of the night. I am very disappointed having loved Magnavox products in the past. Buy only if you want to buy a new one every 10 months."
3,"Great sound, poor reception.","Like the sound, but you can't wake to buzzer if you were listening to radio on sleep mode. Wakes you to radio,Cd or buzzer only if you remember to make that choice. I like clock radios that you can listen to the radio and the alarm wakes you with a buzzer like it should because at night your volume is on low and the buzzer would be loud. Duh!!!"
1,Worked fine - Until it stopped working,"I liked this for about a year, then it started crapping out on me. The selection switch (i.e. Radio-CD-Buzzer) got flaky and you had to screw around to get it ""just right"" in order to hear the music.Then it started coughing on CD tracks. It would play a couple of tracks, then hiss and wheeze and finally give up, unable to play any more. And it did this with store-bought CDs, not home-recorded ones.So now I have to buy another because Magnavox made the decision to put out a piece of garbage. Needless to say I won't be buying Magnavox again."

5,On becoming a great writer.,"""Women In Love"" ranks among the finest films from an unrivaled era in screen history. ""Faggots"" was and remains a seminal American novel, and ""The Normal Heart"" one of the best and most produced American plays of the twentieth century. This book charts for lovers of great writing exactly how Kramer forged himself into a literary triple threat. It's easy to be distracted by his formidable civic achievements and confrontational public persona, but as an artist and living writer of fiction he ranks among the grand masters. This book is a treasure."
1,"Well built, does not work reliably","This punch is nicely finished, the body unscrews into three parts so you can disassemble it easily.However, the internal mechanism catches to give a punch only about one time out of five. You must lift the punch tip from the surface you are punching in order to try again, so you have to refind your target on each punching attempt."
1,"""Out the Door""","The quality of writing of this book is so poor it's actually painful to read. I can't imagine taking the content seriously, let alone attempting to put any of it into practice. The author would do well to sign up for some elementary classes in the English language. The book isn't worth buying or reading in my opinion."
2,Yikes...,"Well, I build furniture and should have known better than to fill the tabletop grooves with this stuff. I had a bunch of customers contact me stating that the wood filler has cracked and fell through the table...I would imagine that for normal applications, this would work fine, but do NOT put this stuff in between cracks...use something epoxy-based for that...or Fanowood...That's all."
5,just great,It arrived on time and the show is one of the best I've seen since Death Note. The best part is you can re-watch this show over and over and never get tired of it.
4,It's a Christmas Present,Never heard of it. Never seen it. For a friend. Says he wants it for Christmas. Bought it for him.
3,Confused??,"I like to think of myself as an intelligent person with a good understanding of anime. I have been watching anime for years. I do like the imagery and style of Ergo Proxy but the mondane dialogue leaves much to be desired. Most people will say the series seriously needs a second season; of course we will never see. Highly conversational and theorictal, Ergo Proxy lacks the simplicity of other quality anime. It changes protagonist & antagonists several times only to confuse and dielute the plot further. It takes forever to actually explain what a ""Proxy"" is. Then they conveniently cram explanation after another in the final few episodes. I really had high hopes for this series. It was recommended by several people but after a mind numbing viewing I can only recommend its style, imagery, and attempt at a complex idea. Please make a second season and even things out."
5,GREAT DOCUMENTARY,"An exceptional documentary, with dramatized re-enactments. Most chilling is the re-enactment of author John Gilmore interviewing the most likely suspect. This segment, showing Gilmore and the suspected killer talking in a bar is followed by a re-enactment of the murder, as it was presented in Gilmore's book, SEVERED: THE TRUE STORY OF THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER. A fascinating exploration into the twisted and strange Black Dahlia case, one of the most sensational, unsolved murder cases in the history of American crime."
2,Stitching?,"I can't deny, there is quite a few of them for a cheap price. If only they were actually stitched to be ""square,"" and I would have to say the stitching is the most unprofessional stitch I have ever seen on something since home economics class in middle school. This would be well worth it, if you had someone to restitch the sides of the squares. At that point, I'd suggest you just buy your own fabric from Joanne's or any craft store. Not a one of them came out with a perfect ""professional"" squared stitch, or even ""amateur"" stitching for that matter. Just avoid."
5,These pocket squares look sharp,"I have found that these pocket squares look great with my black suit. There are a variety of colors so that you can easily match your shirt, tie, pants, hat, etc. And the price is right! You get an entire rainbow of options in one nice package.Gentlemen- be AWARE of one thing: I've noticed that if you want to look like Don Draper with a square fold, these won't work. The fabric is too loose and flowey for that. I've been unable to create a very sharp crease on these pocket squares.But here is the bottom line fellas: If you're going to the opera, a wedding, prom, perhaps a formal fundraiser or some other event which requires a suit or a tuxedo, I would say you will not regret getting these pocket squares. Insert one into the breast pocket of your suit jacket and women will notice it. They may even smile and say something like ""nice hankerchief"" to which you can reply ""thanks-- it's actually a pocket square."" Then you can engage in conversation and see where it goes."
5,the perfect size,"Now, I've tried silk circles and I've tried silk triangles. Both not bad. Silk rhomboids are kind of ridiculous, of course, and the silk dodecahedron makes me dizzy just to think about it. (Seriously. Think about it. Isn't that messed up?!)But when I came across silk squares, well, my heart just started to flutter like a magical butterfly that has to pee really bad. And now that silk squares come in pocket sizes, I'm so giddy I can barely contain myself. If they came in packs of three-hundred sixty five, I'd buy ten packs. One for each of the remaining years of my life."
3,Reinvention???,"Let me start by saying that I love enrique bunbury's music but I wasn't too impressed with this last record. It's good but just not great. It's the same ol' same ol'. After 3 albums of cabaret-style music, don't you think we need some sort of evolution??Good thing this is a double album because if not then it would've been pretty much a waste.So far highlights are carmen jones, que tengas suertecita, and lo que queda por vivir."
1,El Viaje a Ninguna Parte - La ruta hacia la decadencia,"POR DIOS! Es imposible para los seguidores de Bunbury de antaño, ver como este hombre, que sin duda tiene gran talento, ha ido cavando su propia tumba. Desde la disolución de los Héroes del Silencio, Bunbury lentamente ha ido en descenso, y parece increible como la calidad de sus albumes ha decaido. Si se olvidasen los dos CD's anteriores (Flamingos y Pequeño) y se hiciera una comparación entre Radical Sonora y El Viaje a Ninguna Parte, se vería a este ultimo como algo catastrófico.El Viaje a Ninguna Parte no sorprende con su Música, y sus letras, en su gran mayoría, carecen de la emotividad y de la ironía que poseían sus canciones anteriores.Aun asi, para un fiel admirador de Bunbury, hara falta en su coleccion. Sin embargo, siendo el poseedor de una de las mejores voces y habiendo sido el mejor ""Frontman"" del Rock en Español, pudo haber hecho algo mucho mejor."
1,Dumb,"They prepare a 'very best of' for the international market and when they're almost there, they forget to include one of Small Faces biggest hits and best songs, All Or Nothing. Don't buy this. Dumb boys, do your homework better next time."
4,The Wind Blows Backward,My opinion about this book is it was a love story and in some parts it was good. The people who would like this book is would have to like love stories. I like the being when it just got into datails rght away. the charicters in this book were different they had different ways of thinking. My faviorte part is when he comes back and tells her what had happened. The book gave details all the way through the book. The people in this book fit perfect for the style. One thing that I diddent like about the was that they would stay to one subject forever. In some parts of the book of the book it was really slow and boring. Another thing that I did not like was she pushed him away and she not have.I did not like the fact that the mother was so blind. The last thing I did not like the title of the book.
4,Great read.,"I read this book in grade 6 for the first time, and I checked it out of the library for six months. I found this a wonderful book, and I could identify with what the author was trying to convey. I read this book so much that I could quote passages from it word for word. Now, seven years later, I still have this book. I finally bought my own copy, after two years of searching for it. I haven't read it in a while, but the lessons I learned from it, and the love of poetry that developed from reading it, are still with me."
5,Great Book,"I got interested in this book by first reading ""Look For Me By The Moonlight"". After that book I fell in love with Mary Hahn's books. I'm right in the middle of ""The Wind Blows Backward"" and I can't put it down. I love the way Mary shows reality to the characters. The unusual relationship between Spencer and Lauren is remarkably realistic in any couple these days. The shy Lauren trys and trys harder each time to ease the troubled Spencer's pain. With sex, drugs, and achohol, this book may be inappropriate for any one under 10-years-old. This book will keep you hanging off your seat reading page after page."
5,Wow!,"This is my all time favorite book. I have two copies. I read it over and over and over, and I never get tired of it. Every single word in this book is interesting. Usually, I skip words in other novels, but I read every single word of this book, because it is a masterpiece. Every girl on this world would love this book with a passion. I wish they would make it into a movie, it would be a hit. I love this tale of love and it will always be my #1."
4,Pretty good,"The Wind Blows Backward is one of my books from my younger days. Lauren, is a painfully shy highschool senior, who can't wait for school to be over, Spencer is the popular kid. Lauren and Spencer was best friends in junior high, but dropped her, when they made it to highschool for the more popular kids. It's senior year, and now Spencer wants to reclaim Lauren's friendship, he feels like Lauren is the only one who truly knows him. Lauren doesn't know how to take Spencer sudden interested for friendship with her again. The two starts dating, and Lauren quickly realizes Spencer has secrets, and has a deep depression about his life. I throught the book was good, Lauren was there for Spencer when he needed her most. The only problem I had with the book is that I think Lauren might have moved a little too fast with Spencer as far as taking the relationship to the next level sexually. Still a good read."
5,Love at first sight and still going strong,"I read this book at the age of 11 when I was in 7th grade. I just happened to pick it up when I was sitting in my boring English class, which was first period. It was almost new then, over the pass 5 years I have read the book too many times to count. It is now missing its back cover and is taped in many places but it is still loved very much. The book brings out feelings that many teens can relate to. It also brings hope to some and helps others understand. The book drew me in with the portrayal of a tragic love between Lauren and Spencer that prevailed under very strenuous conditions. This book was hailed the girl book of the year when it was published but I believe that not only girls but also boys will love ""The Wind Blows Backwards""."
2,Appropriate for a 12 yo?,"I'm writing my review through the eyes of a mother of a 12 yo girl who loves to read and has read every Mary Downing Hahn books. When she did not put the book down up in her room, I thought it must be good. I skimmed the book later. I told her we needed to have a book discussion the next day. I felt that this book could have waited until she was older and more experienced as it contained material about having sexually intercourse, smoking pot, drinking and driving. I think MDH could have been more responsible writing about these issues by having Lauren listen more to instincts, quesioning her choices. Frankly Spencers mood swings and reckless behavior could have had dire consequences for Lauren."
4,The Wind Blows Backward,"I liked The Wind Blows Backward a lot, its one of my favorites, a classic realistic fiction book about a love story, I normally don't like love stories, but this one has action in it too, and it makes it interesting.[...] Find out for yourself by reading this book The Wind Blows Backward, it's a great story and is interesting all the way through, I recommend this book to everyone who loves love stories but more so of action, you would want to read this book. I loved this book a lot it will definitely go on my top list of favorite books that I've read, if you read it too, I bet you would say the exact same."
4,H. Williams,"I liked the book "" The Wind Blows Backward"" because it was written espically for teenagers in my age group, although I think that girls would prefer it more than boys. It was filled with alot of drama and some moments of suspense. One thing that I didn't like was that it was sort of slow paced and seemed to drag on in some parts, but it was worth continuing to read. All in all, it was a pretty enjoyable book."
2,just 'ok',"As soon as i started reading, i realized that i was reading a book that was almost 20 years old. all of the statistics and examples are extremely old. the message behind the book was powerful. but i would rate this book as just 'ok'...."
5,Will someday be considered a classic.,"I've been reading ""historical romance"" for 35 years and have never read a better written book. Sharon and Tom Curtis tell a gripping story filled with faceted characters that you grow to love. When you finish this book you miss the characters and pray that someday they will write a sequel. Because it is written from both the male and female perspective the characters are realistic."
5,fantistic;;,"I hhave read this book [5] times it just gets better everytime . I would love to know if the author is still writing books ,I hope so . I would love to see a secquil to The windflower. It has alot of potentiel for another book about Cat /or raven .Thank you!S.lee"
4,Pirate romp in 1813,"Merry leads a dull life in Virginia except for rare times when she sketches portraits of British spies for her brother, a US intelligence officer. On one such venture, she encounters pirate Devon. They kiss and then it's back to her boring life. Then, on a trip to London to please her aunt, Merry is kidnapped in the course of a burglary and ends up on Devon's ship. It quickly is clear that Devon is no ordinary pirate - and he demands that Merry turn over the name of her brother. She refuses. This leads to several hundred pages of fun romantic tension as the two learn to trust each other and love each other. In the meanwhile, the reader becomes good friends with a charming pirate crew.Lots of romantic tension, an interesting setting (War of 1812 politics) and some great characters make this a really fun read. It misses a fifth star because it's a bit to drawn out."
3,What's all the hoopla.,"I just don't see how this book got such great ratings. First off, this is not a romance. It was missing passion and character, and the hero and heroine was not given enough time together to build a loving relationship. Then, finally towards the end, they suddenly decided to marry and admit their love for each other? The sentences were too long, and I could not figure out what the author was trying to express. I found myself anticipating the parts of the story where the characters actually conversed. Overall the storyline was lame, limp, passionless, and full of distrust. There was very little danger, and we did not come across the villain until the very end of the story. Would I recommend this book? Don't think so."
4,"Adore secondary characters, love hero, not so fond of Merry","Okay, the reviews for this book (including the low stars) are pretty much right on. I happened to love Devon since he proved to be very witty and noble in his own way. Morgan was a great love to hate him character. My heart was very tied up with Cat who seemed cold, but really has the most tender heart of all the characters, and I also was very fond of Raven who is very amusing. Merry is everythign I despise in a heroine (even if she is only eighteen). She cries at everything that happens, makes silly, foolish mistakes and is incapable of being led by her head. It is a wonder that Cat and Raven and Devon actually love her. I will say that she can be funny at times, but really...trying to escape from a pirate ship in the midst of battle w/ another pirate ship in a rowboat with an old man and no clothes or food (just a pet squid) and then ending up alone on a deserted island and contracting malaria is a bit much. Merry is a fool"
1,Disappointed,"I wish there was some way of designating books of whether they are adult of young adult. This book had high ratings and I bought it, but couldn't get passed the 20th page. If I were 12 or 14 maybe it would have been a different story but this is in no way a book for an intelligent female adult. The dialogue make the female lead sound like a dimwitted child. Perhaps my rating is unfair because I couldn't get further into the book and give it more of a chance but when there are so many more worthy authors out there will real literature and adventures I don't feel compelled to waste my time."
4,Delbert McClinton,"One of my all time favorite singers. The more I hear him, the more I love his music. Have five or six of his cds."
3,Good resource but same as previous edition,"Yep, I wasted $15 on this. If you haven't got a previous edition, then this is an OUTSTANDING resource for those interested in pursuing clinical psyc in grad school. If you do have a previous edition, do not buy - especially if you have the 2004-2005 edition. There is nothing substantially different as far as I can tell."
5,Just what Barron's is missing--inside views of the top schoo,"Wow! I just received my copy of the guide in the mail from, yes, amazon.com, and I think it's a terrific resource. It will be of use to me and my students as i work with them to gain admission to America's top colleges. A college admissions officer told me Mitchell's guide was a great resource for her, and i can tell already it will be a great resource for me as well"
1,Not What I Ordered,"The product I received was not what was pictured. After contacting the supplier 3 times, they finally admitted that the product I ordered was not actually available and I would have to cancel my order."
5,Sting rules!,"This video features great matches and awesome interviews exclusively found on this video. It is a great look back at Sting's years from the WOlfpack years back in black to his 'crow"" look and all the way up until very recently. Sting is a role model to millions and one of the top 10 greatest wrestlers of all time. Check it out! I highly recamend this and his past videos called ""Deadly Venom"" and ""The Man Behind the Mask"". They all were so great."
5,Sting 2 AWESOME in BLACK,I liked the Sting Video very much. It included his matches from Spring Stampede 1999 to Fall Brawl when he turned on Hogan. Masterfully done. Especially with the four-way screen with the four way dance matches.
3,"""Never Fear - Underdog Is Here!""","UNDERDOG is a fun frolic for those who remember the cartoon about the shoe-shine boy who has an alter ego. The adventures on this DVD brought back a few memories. There are even special features that include episode listings and cliff hangers along with other short cartoons.The voices are witting and the rhyming is clever but it has a few signature trademarks that once you see it, will be the start of many great memories.A fun and inexpensive DVD with a few extras for the kids and adults. (11-29-02)"
3,Could have had more...,I thought that this one was rather bare compaired to the last 2 releases... I thought that it could have had more episodes but the one like liked the most was the one about the witch who put Polly asleep for one thousand years... Other then that I did not like this one as well as the other ones...
1,I wanna !,"I've become keen on re-connecting with 'Underdog' recently, but if I read the many low-star ratings for what is available astutely, then why would I want to be so keen ? Apparently, someone needs to re-evaluate their firm stance. I'll keep my money until something interesting comes along. Then I'm all over it !"
3,a bit disappointing,"i was a bit disappointed, as i have read her other books. this seems to get bogged down with all the barge lore for almost half of the book and then the actual story and ending seem rushed. do read her previous works!"
3,Brit Chicks on the Water,"An enjoyable bit of Brit Chick Lit, LIFE SKILLS has all the requisite ingredients: two very different friends (sensible, independent Julia and glamorous Daddy's girl Suzy), one unsuitable suitor, a suitable suitor who is rebuffed, an odd occupation (operating a canal boat hotel), and a couple of non-relationship-related crises. Fforde keeps the story moving, interspersing lots of information about canal boats holidays, which sound quite pleasant (Hmmm vacation idea...). There is some frustration with Julia's stubborn refusal to give her suitable suitor Fergus any sort of chance, but that's the stuff of Chick Lit. A fun read overall."
3,Likeable but frustrating,"Overall, I liked this book. The suject matter was interesting, but it almost seemed like two books joined together. In the first part, Julia joins up with Suzy to run a canal boat hotel. Half through the novel, Julia discovers she is pregnant and then spends the rest of the novel fighting off her suitor (the baby's father) and refusing to marry him for what seems to me to be no good reason. This latter half of the novel,spoiled the whole story for me somewhat."
1,Pyramid Amps suck,The Amp no longer works and after reading many reviews on Pyramid Amps it seems they have a reputation for burning out all the time even when hooked up correctly and paired correctly with speakers. Save your money people and don't waste time on these Amps. It may cost a bit more to get a more reputable brand but it's worth it. You really do get what you pay for and Pyramid Amps are cheaply priced for that very reason. I plan on replacing it with a Boss or Rockford Fosgate which seem to be two brands that reviewers are happy with because they are still using the same amps over 5 years + and still going strong.
1,"Stop it, Ottman!","John Ottman managed to score one of the best thrillers in cinema with The Usual Suspects. Since then, where did the talent go?Despite a track or two on the X-men 2 soundtrack, none of his recent, or even past scores have managed to impress me in the least, and now that he seems to have gotten himself into the superhero genre, I can only cringe at Fantastic Four and remind myself next time to take a pass on anything he does in the future.His themes are sparse, vague and vacant, his action is staccato and painful to the ears, and his use of chorus is just plain wrong. Perhaps his emulation of Michael Kamen's X-men score just went too far and too long, but somewhere along the line he lost his touch.I fear for Superman Returns..."
1,RED DAWN MEETS HOLOCAUST PLUS ALIENS,"Aliens need the blood of 8 million humans in order for their species to survive a virus. Rather than just take donated blood, they must take and kill the whole person. Apparently blood from recently dead people doesn't work either. The race is advance enough to create wormholes, but not a virus vaccine. The acting is mediocre at best. It is a shame to see Carl Weathers, of Rocky fame, fall this far from grace. A small group of vigilantes decide to take on the US government and the alien race. They saved a lot of money by making the aliens look human. No nudity, bad language, or sexy stuff. The special effects in this movie haven't advanced since the early Star Trek days."
2,"""You wanna know what happened?","A group of idealists teamed up with soldiers and a father who loved his daughter to blow up your infernal device.""Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie.I dunno, I hope for more from my science fiction than this; the special effects are not good, contrary to some of the other reviewers; the plot weak, the science ridiculous, and even the insight into the human condition--what so much science fiction is really about--totally missing. So, really, the only reason to watch it is if you are totally bored, for some of the action sequences. But you can do better, much better."
1,Beware! Low Budget B-Movie.,"Alien Siege brings to the screen the unlikely scenario that a race of all too human-looking aliens will arrive in search of human blood to prevent their extinction.Sometime in the not-so-distant future the Kulku aliens arrive in need of 8 million humans' blood to cure a deadly disease that is killing off their race. The United States has to provide 800,000 people, however, with 300,000 to go a scientist's daughter is among the chosen to be handed over to be turned into ""blood supplies."" The father, subsequently, embarks on a lame adventure to rescue his ""baby girl.""The movie starts off interestingly enough and then it's downhill from then on. Don't look for the movie to pick up; it doesn't. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all way below average.In a nutshell, Alien Siege is definitely not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment if intoxicated and/or in a silly mood."
1,"Wooden Acting, Simple and Unengaging Plot",Wooden acting and a predictable plot make this a complete yawner. The basic premise that aliens for some reason must harvest humans has been done before and done better.
2,Tool Didn't Work,Nothing to do with the fuse itself. It was the wrong one for the purpose that it was ordered for.
2,over priced & does not perform,"I had high expectations for this make up as I am 37 & have never paid more than $15 for a bottle of foundation. My facial skin is beginning to show signs of age, i.e. under eye lines, mild age spots/discoloration, dryness/ loss of tautness & I have enlarged pores from acne scars. I'm a no-fuss girl...I want to set it & forget it & am NOT ok w/ mid-day touch-ups. My make up, whether eyeliner, mascara or foundation, needs to stay where I apply it. This foundation does feel great when first applied but shortly after slid all over my face & just looked awful-settled in under eye lines & really enhanced the fact that they are there, settled in the acne scars-really, it enhanced all of the flaws I wanted to conceal! I will not be purchasing this again. I think, if I were still in my 20's I might like this makeup, but my $12 L'Oreal out-performs this."
4,It is a Foundation,I have bought this product based on fantastic reviews that I had read on another page where it was on sale for almost twice the price. Finding it here at an affordable rate made my decision. It was delivered very fast!It does the job pretty nicely and the only better products that I have used where also far more expensive.I left it on twice over night after heavy parties and my skin tolerated it very well.
5,Love this foundation,"This foundation is super. You only need a small amount for full coverage. If you need extra coverage in spots, this make up is also buildable. I use it over a primer, and it blends easily. I've had compliments on my skin since I started using this product, and I'll continue to buy it."
2,Star Bores,"Caroline Munro runs around half-naked in this thing. That's why I gave it two stars. Hopefully Christopher Plummer was paid well for this turkey. If you want a STAR WARS ripoff really bad, this is a really bad ripoff. Robert Tessier plays a sort of good guy cop. Liked him more in HARD TIMES where old Chuck Bronson wails away on his pointy bald noggin. Wasn't Marjoe Gortner some kind of preacher? David Hasselhoff ... 'nuff said. Interesting note, they dub Caroline Munro. Curious, she actually does speak ENGLISH Hey it does has a John Barry Score."
1,Watch it only BECAUSE it's bad,"In the 1970s, your first clue that you'd bought a ticket to a turkey was the appearance of Marjoe Gortner, who probably can't act dead convincingly.Star Crash, an attempt to cash in on the success of movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", wins the Velveeta Crown of Cheese. You name it, it's got it....weak plot, lame dialogue with even worse delivery, and lousy special effects (particularly the colored starfield) and DREADFUL acting.The best reaction you'll have watching this one is to scratch your head and wonder WHAT???? Christopher Plummer is doing in this movie. Was he broke?Watch it only if all the copies of ""Star Wars"" are out (and I mean the realie, where Han shot first) and you're in the mood to groan."
3,Classic,I love this jacket. A classic Dickies style with the eisenhower cut which is great for my body type (not too long like many jackets and hoodies).
2,Bring your production back home Dickies!!!!,"Frayed and falling apart at the cuffs, the end of the zipper, and poorly finished inside.Hard, fast, and dirty. Is this how work ware is made nowadays?Work clothing of ANY kind should NOT fall apart after 1 wash."
3,OK Jacket,Was a little disappointed with this jacket. First of all it is pretty short(vertically). I was looking for a longer jacket. Maybe I should of bought a size bigger(I bought an XL). Also another reviewer mentioned this jacket looked pretty good. Well when I wore it all I could think is mechanic style lol. Descent work jacket and that's about it.
2,very uncomfortable,"THis is an unlined jacket, thus it is very uncomfortable wearing with T shirt when your bare arms touch the rough material. The armhole is too wide. And it looks cheap (it's cheap indeed). Also the size runs small. if your size is S, buy size M. I normally wear size S and this jacket in S is too small for me. However, the arm is long and wide. very disappointed"
3,Too disjointed,"I bought this on a whim to relax. I have played classical piano for 25 years (for my own enjoyment) but had little exposure to the same music transposed to classical guitar. I recognized most of the selections. The first 4 tracks really delivered but the middle third of the CD becomes abruptly loud and soft and, frankly, sounds poorly mixed. The latter part of the CD finishes well. The CD could have been uniformly fantastic if some of the middle selections had been left out, or replaced by less orchestral pieces. Because of the disconnect I rarely play the CD, knowing that the quiet, reflective mood it induces will soon be sonically destroyed."
5,Wendy....Yes Lisa........,"I like playing this cd on rainy dayz. I was a teenager when it was released, alot of the songs have memories for me. I especially like ""Everything But U"", ""HoneyMoon Xpress"", ""Song About"" and ""Stay"". Every song is kool and Wendy and Lisa signed my vinyl copy. Thanks WNL! Luv ya! xoxo."
2,water ball gun,This product is a great 'idea'. Creating globules of water that shoot out of the gun but practical use finds this water gun a sad performer in a water gun fight. Nice idea but if your looking to put 'water rounds down range' at people stick to the super soakers and such.
3,A bit disappointed,I was excited when I read the other reviews on this product and couldn't wait to try this. I have a severe back injury that keeps me in quite a bit of pain creating spasms in my upper back. I took this product and did get a bit of relief. I was hoping it would relieve the spasms enough that I could go off prescription meds. It didnt help quite that much. This product may well be what you are looking for if you have cramps and spasms if they are not as severe as mine are (a 10 on a scale of 1-10).
3,lkim,"The product was suggested by a herbalist and she had great results. For me, it did not reduce enough relief. Also tried Turmeric Force and Curamin. I went back to traditional pain relievers."
3,It's not THAT bad,"Yes, I bought this book used because I have enjoyed the Nero Wolf series. It certainly doesn't come up to those books. It started really slow for me, but I've become more invested while reading. It's not terrific, but it's not awful. I've certainly started worse books and refused to finish them."
1,Sobre Saint Germain... prefiero la Enseñanza confiable,"Lo único que es menester decir es que ""Misterios Develados"" no fue escrito por Conny Mendez, sino por el señor Guy Warren Ballard, chela del Maestro Saint Germain.Si el texto tiene un error así de serio en la portada, me pregunto cómo será por dentro."
5,El mejor libro,"Este libro lo compre porque queria tener unos libros de Conny Mendez y el titulo me llamo la atencion ""Misterios develados"" dije cuales son esos misterios de la vida. Despues lee este libros despues de 3 meses de comprarlo y hay que libro mas poderosa. Explica lo que la mente humana tiene el poder de hacer y nosotros no sabemos"
5,THE ULTIMATE DEBUSSY PIANO WORKS,"This is the second time I bought this album. Casadesus plays the ultimate debussy. I wrote a similar review for the sony/Columbia album. No one plays it better, in my opinion. ""The Engulfed Cathedral"" is worth the price of the album. It is Debussy as it was meant to be played. Enough said."
2,kinda cheap,"wouldn't order again...lights work, but the cheap covers of plastic to get different colors are not too attractive."
5,New ebay seller's MUST HAVE!!,Do you want to sell stuff on ebay but don't know where to start?

It very simply lays out the details for you to allow you to learn what you need to know to be an excellent seller on ebay. This book gives you great tips to save you money in case you don't have a fancy camera or photo studio (it's not necessary) and gives suggestions on handling your taxes.Definitely the first book one should read before deciding to sell on ebay!
2,"Like a TV Guide article, but longer","Mr. Hack has written an extended TV Guide article and published it under the guise of a 250-page book. While ""Madness In the Morning"" does offer interesting anecdotes along the way, it fails to address obvious questions: what differentiates morning news from other forms of delivery and how has the profile of the morning news viewer changed and impacted the formats of these programs. If this book were a morning show, you would tune out and go back to bed."
2,eh... pages are falling out.,i needed to get it for New Mexico History at CNM ... I am upset that pages are falling out.
4,adorable!,"Looks exactly like it is pictured...The brushed nickel look is really nice. Its in my new bathroom which is all earth colors and hardware is brushed nickel...Its alittle smaller than your typical wall clock but other than that its great. It doesnt have that ""cheap"" look that you find with alot of these wall clocks in this price range."
4,Joel Goldsmith's vision,"I read this book in 1984 along with ""The Thunder of Silence"" and my own spiritual life changed radically for the better. I still follow the Infinite Way in my life. Lorraine Sinkler edited most of his early talks and notes. Ms. Sinkler's biography gave me great insight into his journey and his perceptions of spiritual living, and help with my own."
2,Rubbish and mystical hokum!,What a bunch of garbage... diluting others' spiritual work and molding it in his own image.
5,for those who dream,"It's difficult to capture in a brief review the humor and delight found in Wondrous Journey. Not just the telling of a physical journey, this book grows--spiritually and emotionally--along with the man who experienced the highs and lows of trekking the globe. With evocative photographs supporting the tales, this book carried me to places I've dreamed of and longed to see, and to parts of the world I never imagined.Wondrous Journey is for those who find passion in a snow-capped mountain, answers and more questions along a raging river, joy in a child's smile. And, especially for those who wish such things."
5,Small but effective dog brush,Although the brush is small it not only works great on my maltese but is also very effective for my westies. This is a soft brush and is best used if there are no snarls or matting.
3,Very small dog grooming brush.,I HAVE TWO 13# BICHONS. THIS BRUSH WAS NOT USEFUL FOR USE ON THEIR SEMI-CURLY HAIR. IT MAY WORK AFOR SMALLER DOGS THAN MINE.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The brush is the perfect size for a small breed dog.However, the bristles on the brush are entirely toosoft. I own a long haired 3lb yorkie and this wasa joke. It would not even penetrate her coat toget a tangle out or even smooth her fur down.The handle is great though. I was disappointed."
2,Liil Pals are great except this brush,I have the other L'il Pals grooming tools and they are great but this brush is only good to brush the sides of my yorkies mouth because the bristles are so soft it doesn't go through the hair at all on any other part of the body. The bristles are softer than a baby brush.
4,Awesome Replacement!,This replacement top for my 2000 Chevy Tracker is great ... high quality ... clear windows ... supburb fit ! It was a challenge to get it on but I expected that because it has to be a snug fit. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of this item.
3,Bestop,"The top was basically easy to put on but time comsuming if done by one person.Found problem when traveling on the expressway, the right side window kept slipping lose. Had to remove the side window completely and placed it back on carefully so the plastic strip fit snuggly to the frame of the vehicle. Now seemed to be holding properly."
5,Fantastic Meals for the last 15 years,"I love my clay cooker! So easy to use, and after your meal is in the oven, there's really nothing more to do until it's ready. Absolutely the best cooker for chicken, although, a huge roaster may not fit. I buy a fryer chicken and before cooking, I line the cooker with a piece of parchment paper and that makes the cleanup so much easier."
3,If you really want a clay pot cooker this is the one to get,"Cooker works just fine but discolors badly since none of the pot is glazed (although I understand that glazing, at least in part, defeats the purpose of using a clay pot to begin with). We've cooked several dishes in the clay pot and cannot detect any taste advantage in using this pot. So, after a short time it went to limbo - where unused household items go to spend eternity."
4,clay baker,"It was smaller than I thought it was going to be. However, it's a nice dish for baking a loaf of bread."
1,Curtis DVD Players,"I got a Curtis Surround Sound DVD in DEc 2005 model 5028. What a piece of junk. Never did play surround sound, nor load a DVD properly. I had to use a screwdriver to remove a DVD and also had to push with my finger the DVD into the area where it would know that it had a DVD in place. Now in Aug 2006, it won't even recoginze a DVD.NO support, Warranty is useless.I guess you get what you pay for...this was cheap!"
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"This dresser is a very cheaply made Chinese product. 50% of the drawer guides (plastic) were broken off when I received it and one handle completely broke into two pieces the first time the dresser was used. It is extremely lightweight and may be made of wood but if it is, the wood is balsa or something equally light. Cherry finish is, basically, a dark reddish brown coating of paint. Would not recommend this dresser. Not holding up at all. The pictures are much nicer than the actual item."
3,cheap handles,"Opened a drawer, the handle broke in my hand. I emailed company, still no response on how to get replacement handle."
2,Exciting tale but shaky history,A fast read but not the way to learn modern Swedish history. The author confuses fact and fiction hopelessly. Can't even get the Swedish flag right on page 210.
2,"A mixture of excellence, paranoia and marginal story-telling","It is hard to capture this book. It makes, in fictionalized form, some poignant observations about U.S. as well as Swedish collaboration with Nazi Germany. The elevation of these items to closely guarded ""secrets"" is inaccurate. Walls of silence, at least for the U.S. participation, might be more accurate. Within days after reading the book (talking about Ford and GM) the news broke about IBM, its Swedish subsidiary and the ""Hollerith Baracke"" apparently standard concentration camp inventory.As actual story telling, the book fails to convince. It starts out OK, but the actions of the protagonists, as well as of the Swedes, defy common sense. The author could have written an exposé, it might have been good. But he is no novelist."
4,It's a Spy Novel...not Historical Non-Fiction!,"This is an excellent read and gives a unique insight into psychological espionage from the perspective of a Physician-Assassin. If you like spy and political intrigue-type novels, then you will really like this one. If you are more the Historical Novel-type and historical accuracy is a must, then you might get distracted by some of the author's historical ""liberties"". As far as the criticism about proper Swedish spellings etc, if you are the kind of person that bases your judgement of a book's enjoyability on such things. then this one isn't for you. If you like spy thrillers with an interesting point of view, check this one out!"
5,It Happened to Jane,"I was required to see a movie and I choose this one because of the clean language, humor and overall pleasure in whatching a Doris Day movie."
3,Just Did Not Trick My Switch,"I love Doris Day and Jack Lemon, but togeather they just didn't seem to make a good match to me. The movie is slow and the plot is what I did not enjoy. Her yelling George a lot of the time just was to boring for me."
2,Too long,This movie may have had potential but they blew it with the long drawn out plot. It is rather boring and seems to have just been made to put forth a political agenda rather than entertain.
5,It Happened To Jane,It was a very uplifting movie about overcoming injustice. Enjoyed the relationship between Doris Day and Jack Lemon.
4,Nice movie,"This is a typical nice Doris Day movie. It's a movie about the little guy fighting the big guy. Doris Day being the little small business owner, who happens to ship lobsters. It's not a serious social statement type film, has some laughs. Doris Day is as good as she is in any of her films. I bought this film for my mother who likes to watch older musicals and comedy films. She liked it."
4,Best of Doris Day and Jack Lemon From Amazon.,I remember seeing this movie when I was young and it was very entertaining then. I feel that it is more enjoying now since it has been so long since the last time I saw it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching Doris Day or Jack Lemon or just enjoys good entertainment.
3,Great First Half,"I'm going to call this volume the staff's ""artistic phase"". From start to finish, this volume was meant to be a metaphorical mind trip and it succeeds on many levels. While this certainly impressed me, it'll be interesting to see how much it impresses the general audience. This volume takes us into some very interesting places just to develop Honoka and introduce a new character and small plot hook but I completely enjoyed it none the less. While this series has been a little slow to grow on me, this volume has me quite anxious to see what happens in the second half and what else we're going to learn about our heroine. This is possibly the volume that will truly sell the series to future fans."
3,Useful but difficult,"This book is the most detailed account I have found of the relationship and conflict between Servetus and Calvin. For anyone interested in this subject, the book is invaluable. However, it has been copied, perhaps photocopied, in such a way as to make reading difficult. Lighting is very important.Consequently, it is a necessary source for someone seriously pursuing its specific subject, but the struggle to read badly copied pages will probably be too great for the casual reader."
4,Merle Did It Again,"I`m Happy To Say, That This Is A GREAT ALBUM, By Merle Haggard. The More I Listen To His Music, The More I Like ?m. After All His Gone Through, In His Early Years, I Think It`s Just Wonderful That He Had The Chance To Make All Those Great Albums He`s Done. Thank You Merle."
2,"If ""doing"" without understanding is enough...","37 pages of curriculum instruction, 3 pages of history/meanings, 11 pages to teach you how to draw two ovoids one within the other...Nice instructors manual and handout source for a kids workshop, but the lack of _meaning_ and information density is very low.I felt like more than half of the book is missing, perhaps volume 2 has more meaningful discusion.All in all, not a bad book, but not what I was hoping for, if you want an intense course on the mechanics of drawing NWNA, then this is it. If you are teaching children, this is a good resource too."
5,Wonderful Instructional DVD,"After seeing the 1st ABCs of Strings DVD, I was anxious to see this next one. I was NOT disappointed. The violin playing by the little girl was great as was the piano accompaniment by the young man. It even showed restringing the violin. Ms Rhoda always does a fine job of explaining and showing things. I can't wait for the DVD about the cello and bass."
4,A Kiwi Gem!,"Track listing:Close The DoorAt SeventeenHere It Comes AgainSailingSouvenirBrokenLove RemainsTending The Happiness TreeWhat You Do With What You've GotSong To The SirenThese DaysA great little album. Beautiful covers including Christopher Cross' ""Sailing"". If you want an album to chill out to this is a great choice. Her voice is much more mature and nuanced then your average young pop star.If you can find it, Amber's other CD ""Great Escape"" is worth checking out as well. The title track, an original composition, is the jewel of the album. I discovered it listening to a New Zealand radio station on the internet. Also lovely is her cover of Stephen Bishop's ""On And On""."
4,At Seventeen,Got the CD because of track no. 2 - At Seventeen. You will not be able to find a better version of it elsewhere!
5,Love these cars!,"Boy, were these a HUGE hit in our house this Christmas! Golly, are they ever cool! Superman's pose is on his car (why he would ever need one is a mystery to me!) and is like the one on the package. Lex Luthor's is white and has him on it as well and it just provides hours of fun for this house of boys. If you have a hard time explaining to your little one why Superman would EVER need a car, you might mention that the other superheroes need one and he lets them drive his since he really doesn't. Anyway, these are the size of regular Hot Wheels cars and why it says the package weighs 8 pounds is beyond me. Less than a pound. If you can't find one here, check out your local food/department stores which is where I found one. Highly, highly recommend!"
2,not very good,"For the price, the vacuum cleaner is ok. It is quieter than other vacuums and probably has good filtration although I have no real way to know this.The cord is too short and the unit tips over easily. The bare floor adjustment causes the dirt to be pushed around and makes no sense. When you adjust it to clean bare floors, the front of the vacuum lays flat and prevents the dirt from entering. Kinda stupid.It has good suction, just expected the bare floor setting to work better. As it is, it will push dirt away, then maybe collect it on the return stroke.You should look elsewhere, or spend more if you want a great vacuum, because this one isn't great."
2,"I really, really wanted this vacuum to work","I really wanted this vacuum to work, but I ended up sending it back because of its abysmal performance on a very low-piled carpet. This model only had mediocre performance on the concrete floors in my unit and it fared even worse on the newly installed Interface FLOR (Modern Mix) carpet tiles; the vacuum's suction would barely pick up fuzz and pile remnants stuck to the face of the carpet.I was also disappointed by the unit's cheap-looking components. The components seemed like something from a dollar store; the plastic may have been durable, but the appearance, design, and feel seemed cheap. The only pros to this vacuum are its small form, the canister's aesthetics, and it's refreshingly quiet noise level.I would definitely not buy this vacuum again, and I would have great difficulty trying out a different Bosch vacuum after this experience."
4,I like my little vacuum cleaner,"I searched the Internet for a long time to find a vacuum cleaner that would work for me. It needed to be VERY compact (my home is small with very little storage space), lightweight, and have a heppa filter. And not too expensive! Finding this one was a miracle. It works very well, takes up little space, and was affordable. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that, like most canister vacuums, if I pull too hard it tips over which can be a pain when moving around the house."
4,fine case overview,"Despite the horrible acting of a terribly misplaced Lawrence Block as the host(he has the onscreen presence of a corpse), this is a fine overview of the Zodiac case. Both newcomers to the case and those familiar with it will be fascinated by this informative video. I myself happen to be one of those Zodiac-case ""buffs"", and I truly enjoyed the tape, especially the news footage from the Zodiac era. I particularly enjoyed seeing clips of an interview with main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. I lent the tape to a fellow true-crime buff who had no knowledge of the case at all and she came away with her curiosity piqued. Needless to say, she is planning on purchasing Robert Graysmith's excellent book ""ZODIAC"". Buy and enjoy!"
4,Same Performances as Boxed Set,"Well, I made a mistake ordering this set from Amazon; an honest mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. I figured that since Karajan's companion ""2CD"" set of Tchaikovsky's Symphonies 4-6 was different than those contained on the DG ""Collector's Edition"" box set, that somehow these recordings of Symphonies 1-3 would be different as well. Wrong! Every performance on this double-disc, including ""Marche Slave"" and ""Capriccio Italien,"" are identical to the accounts featured on the ""Karajan Conducts Tchaikovsky"" 8CD box. Oh well, at least no one else will make the same mistake as long as they read this review."
2,Didn't hit the mark,"I read Joanna Trollope's Daughters-in-Law and really enjoyed it so was excited to be reading another Joanna Trollope masterpiece. Unfortunately this one did nothing for me. I really wasn't interested in the characters and the multiple points of view, which I usually enjoy, in this instance just frustrated me. Nothing exciting happened and there was nothing to grab me. I kept reading hoping for a great ending that bought it all together. Again I was disapointed. I would recommend you skip this one."
1,House of Drama Queens,You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll wish that you had read a good Tom Clancy novel instead of using up your precious time ploughing through this drivel.
4,very good read,I enjoyed this book which takes place in England. It has a lot of family drama in it and is about kids leaving the nest and for one reason or another having to come back home. The father/husband isn't too happy about it. Joanna Trollope is one of my favorite authors.
4,SECOND HONEYMOON,"ONCE AGAIN, JOANNE TROLLOPE CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF FAMILY DYNAMICS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN AN EASY TO READ, EASY TO IDENTIFY WITH MANNER, AND THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME BUYING EVERYTHING SHE WRITES."
3,Second Honeymoon,"This book dragged and I found myself constantly trying to ""get into it"" but it never happened - I finished the book but with difficulty. Would not recommend this book."
2,Hard to get started...,It was hard to get going in this book as it's rather boring to begin with. Add in all the punctuation and grammatical errors (and there were many) and I can't say I enjoyed it.
4,Enjoyable Read,Love her books. You know her characters and feel like they could be people who live next door. Second Honeymoon did not disappoint and reminded me to look and see if there was any other of the author's books I have missed.
3,Second Honeymoon: Kindle Edition,"I like Joanna Trollope, but I found this novel a bit slow in the beginning, although it picks up as it continues. Note re Kindle edition: A number of typos."
4,Typical Joanna Trollope novel,"If you enjoy Joanna Trollope, then Second Honeymoon is very typical of her work. I have read most of her novels, and as always I enjoyed the story and the characters were all interesting enough to keep me reading. This is not meaningful, literary fiction, but an enjoyable holiday or beach read. However, please note: if typos annoy you then don't buy the Kindle version as it is full of them! English buyers should also note that this novel had also been edited for the American market - spelling of several words had been changed and some words changed completely, such as substituting ""freeway"" for ""motorway""."
5,"Not perfect, but still great!!!","This isn't the best Lackey has ever written. However, it had three major components that led me to enjoy it. 1: It was not co-written with her husband.2:She created a good, beliveable main character, and 3:There was a solid plot, something which the Owl books seemed to lack. This return to Valdemar was refreshing and tear-wrenching, and i want more like it!!!"
3,It was OK...but,"The only reason why I read this book was because it was written by Mercedes Lackey. And, having read almost every other book of the Valdemar series, I found it rather disappointing. I like books that have great characterisation and a good plot to go along with it. The plot was worse than mediocre for the simple fact that i've seen it recycled so many times in her books. I could even predict what would happen in the end. Even the better-than-average characterization could not salvage the plot.For first-time readers, I recommend the LHM series. Although its plot is not new, the characters are fantastically drawn"
4,Yet another great read from Mercedes Lackey,"In this Valdemar story we finally get to read the story of Laven Chitward, one of Valdemars most famous heralds, also known as Laven firestorm. Unable to fit in at his new school, Laven is bullied, and becomes very depressed. Until one day during another painful bulling sesion his gift for firestarting awakes, with disasterous reasults for his tormentors.With the help of heralds and acompanion, Laven soon learns to keep his gift under control and eventually, to direct his awful gift. WHen Karse attacks, Laven proves how strong his firestarting ability really is.This book, was writen really well, and *blushes* at the end I cried, it was a very emotional story."
3,it was okay,"I thought the beginning was great, but somewhere in the middle it lost a lot of life. I felt like some of the characters from the first half were abandoned when they shouldn't have been(his friend Owyn), and the ending felt very rushed. Not one of her best works."
4,This is more like it!,"I was quite disappointed with the latest Herald books (The Owl Series, and the previous Elspeth-centered trilogy). They contained too many boring descriptive passages, and not enough action.Action's back in _Brightly Burning_. This is more like the _Arrows_ trilogy or _The Last Herald-Mage_; good, fun fantasy reading with interesting characters.Recommended, even if you didn't like her last few efforts."
4,Brightly Burning by Mercedes Lackey,"I was overjoyed to find a new book about my 2nd favorite world (Pern being #1). I have enjoyed everyone of her books, including the owl trilogy, which I gather puts me in a minority. Birghtly Burning made me laugh, filled me with rage--that school was straight out of Dickens!--and above all made me cry. Even now several days after finishing the book, I can fill moisture in the corner of my eyes. Thank you for another fine work."
3,Brightly Burning fizzled out,"This is a book that I would love to love. It had good characters (not great, but good) and a totally fascinating premise, I mean, what would happen to ones mind if they had the power to call down fire onto anything at will? The ability to burn the very air and yet the inability to control it? However I kept wanting for there to be a climatic confrontation between Lavan, our hero, the bringer of fire, and Elenor, the Mind Healer with an infatuation with him. I felt like there had to be some big scene between the two, about Elenor's unreciprocated love, and Lavan's guilt about killing (yes he does kill a quite a few people). But THERE WASN'T! I had thouroughly enjoyed the book all the way up to the climax when I realized there were too few pages left to settle that little conflict nicely. Let me say that it would have been fantastic if Lackey hadn;t taken the easy way out! And somehow I don't think this will be resolved in a sequel. -Eli@"
3,"Good, but disappointing.","Overall, the book was good. However, Misty has done much better in the past. The book started out quite well, and the development of the characters was quite good. A good amount of time was spent developing the situation and characters leading up to and shortly after Lan becoming a Herald-trainee. However, after a short period in the Collegium, Lan and company were rushed off to war. At that point the quality of the writing went downhill and the whole feeling seemed rushed. The story may not have been long enough for a second or third book, but it should have been longer. I get the impression that the book was hurridly finished to meet a publishing deadling. That is unfortunate, as Misty writes wonderful material when she spends the time on it. This book seems to be about 100-200 pages too short."
3,Just Okay,"This is the first full book I've read from the author, my attempts at her other's as always resulted in tossing aside half way in. Can't say I was entirly impressed. Although, it didn't help reading right after a wonderfully written Inda seriese.I am throughly intrested in the Val-time period. The idea of Heralds and such, but this book just didn't do it for me. I found the book simple minded in the plot. I didn't like how it focused so much on his school life and such before his time as a trainee. The story was over before it even began, it seemed.However, I do not regret reading it."
2,Definitely Not One of Mercedes Lackey's Best.,"I did not care very much for this book. I couldn't get into it and I usually enjoy her books very much.It seemed like she wrote it just because she had this person in her world's history, and it felt like it should have been just a chapter of another book instead of an entire book of it's own."
4,"Overall, a great addition to the Valdemar series","This book has a severly simple storyline, but i was quite taken to find out its ending. Near the end, Lavan is a truly amazing and powerful character, though i must agree that i am disappointed in the fact that Lavan hardly faced any of his own problems... But really, i do recommend this book and i feel that you should have no regrets after finishing it. After looking at other people's reviews I've analyzed that the older readers probably thought that reading about a ""struggling teenager"" is a pathetic waste of time, which is understandable, but the younger readers, such as myself, would find this an entertaining read so that could be a good thing to keep in mind."
4,Intoxicating Reading,"I was looking for a book to get lost in one day and came upon ""Brightly Burning."" Have read the ""Magic"" series by Mercedes Lackey, I was familiar with the realm of Valdemar. Having thouroughly lost myself in that series I was prepared to be dissapointed in this book (as my expectations were probably too great). How wrong I was! This book was just as compelling as the others I had read by Ms. Lackey! What a joy to loose myself (I must admit, it can become and obsessive world in which to loose yourself) for a few days (you just don't want to put it down). I finished it this morning and I must say, the end is worth the read.Ms. Lackey as a gift for spinning an intoxicating web of lovable characters, lands and events. Her ability to paint a picture witn words helps you put things aside for a while.I recommend this book for a good mid-winter or hot summer night read. When you need to loose yourself, this is a book for you!"
4,bookworm,"I think that this book was pretty good. Not quite up to the usual Lackey books, but it will do. The Lifebond was new and pretty ingeneous thing to come up with. But I agree with some of the others that the other characters were kinda bland. Also the book didn't really match up with what the other books said about Lavan Firestorm."
1,One of the most painful books I've read in a long time,"I really used to like the Valdemar books...I really did. Magic's Pawn/Price/Promise were especially good. You could really empathize with the characters and get caught up with the plot.Boy has it ever jumped shark. I think it started around the Owlknight series. To tell the truth, I had hoped that Brightly Burning would break the tedium- be a breath of fresh air and a new direction.There's nothing quite like the sound of hopes being dashed. Draw out every cliche you could find from all the previous books, and toss them into one. A tramatic childhood, unconrolable and ""unique"" powers, life bonding, sacrificeing oneself to destroy the invading army. It's really, trulely unbearable. Plus, Lavern ends up being life bonded to his own Companion. Nothing fishy there at all, of course not.Do yourself a favor and go read the older books again and stop before you reach the Owl Knight series and Brightly Burning. It will hurt a lot less."
3,A Decent Tale,"Compared to Last Herald Mage series or even Arrows of the Queen series, I thought it was a bit lacking. There were a few points that I thought didn't hold true to the history and character types that Misty had developed in the other books. Though on its own, it is a good story and a captivating read."
1,the worst book ever,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. This book is almost as bad as Anne Perrys Tathea. The whole time your reading it they accomplish nothing! And on top of that the main character dies at the end. But, it gets worse. The guy falls in love with a horse for gods sake. Regardless of the fact that she could talk that is just wrong.This book was a waste of my time."
3,Not bad but....,"Parts of this seemed like a story I've already heard from Misty Lackey (*coughVanyelcough*) but I still enjoyed it. It was a fast, fun read, nonetheless. But very light, no real substance. None of the overpowering emotion of the Vanyel triology, or the bright adventure of the Arrows set. Nothing to make it stand out from Mercedes Lackey's other Valdemar fare. Don't get me wrong, I love the universe of these books, but, well... we need something new here."
2,Dissapointing,"I love the Valdemar series, and while this book rates a 3 star on its own merits it is definetly no more than a 2-star in the Valdemar series.Levan starts out real, intelligent and troubled, but seems to fade into streotype and melodrama. The suuporting cast is a mix of well-written and streotype and never seem to quite click into place.The book just left me wanting something more."
3,"Okay, not great","This was readable and okay, but not one of her best. I felt that Lan was the only fully developed character. The supporting cast were either villians or angels. Lan's life bond didn't seem real to me at all. The author always writes well, but this story didn't grab me and make me care about the characters."
1,The Passive-Aggressive Pyrokinetic,"This book is irritating. Lavan is a poor, picked-upon, beat-up whiner who gets all of his problems solved for him. He's the most passive main character (I can't call him a hero -- he doesn't DO anything) I've ever read. His Firestarting gets out of control and kills some kids? No problem, the Heralds rescue him and then he's Chosen. He can't control his Firestarting? No problem, his Companion channels it all away. The mother of the dead kid gets angry & goes a bit insane & cause problems? No problem, the King steps in and imprisons her away. Karsites invading over the border? No problem, they kill his Companion & get him angry enough to lose control & kill 'em all. Not once does Lavan ever face his problems on his own. Not once does he ever take control of a situation or even try to. All he does is react; not once does he act.Pass on this one. Hunt up the Vanyel trilogy for a great read from this author!"
2,Not her best,"I'm a long-time Misty reader, and this is the first book of hers that I've ever actively disliked. The whole story, from start to finish, has an aura of misery and hopelessness that isn't at all fun to read. It's hard to like the protagonist, and he's surrounded by evil people who hurt him, and good people who do their best to help him but ultimately fail. A real downer, overall, which won't be staying in my collection."
2,Not up to Misty's usual high standards.,"We have a misfit adolescent, misunderstood by his/her family and put upon by his/her peers, who finds a place where s/he is loved, understood, and appreciated for what s/he is, and where the very qualities that got him/her in trouble at home are assets, among the Heralds of Valdemar. Where have we heard this before?Lavan is a much less interesting character than either Talia or Vanyel, and the whole book has a paint-by-numbers feel. I've read on Misty's website that she's decided to take a vacation from the Valdemar books, and this book shows ample cause.Lets hope that after a few years she comes back refreshed, because I'm sure there are more interesting stories to be told in this world."
2,A recycled tale...,"I love Valdemar books. I really enjoyed Arrows and The Last Herald-Mage, and still consider those series some of my favorite books. However, the recent Valdemar novels are boring and lacking any kind of new, interesting idea. A lifebond between a Herald and a Companion? That was simply ridiculous. Everything seemed to happen so fast in the book and it had a sense of being very rushed. I didn't even really care what happened to the characters at the end. The book merits two stars rather than one only because it's by Misty, but I'm really hoping that any other Valdemar stuff she puts out is much better."
2,"Brightly Burning, a Pile of Ash",As a long time fan of Lackey's work I have been anxiously awaiting the release of her latest work. I rushed out and bought the hardback of this latest offering only to find it lacking. While the book shows some promise in the premise and some exciting inovations on the normal relationships this promise is never developed. The characters were all static and this read more as a third grade history then one of Lackey's beautiful stories. I sincerely hope that her next offering improves.
1,Ultimately Empty,"I'm not sure if this was just a bad novel, or if I just didnt enjoy it because I read immediately after blowing through the much more epic Mage Winds and Mage Storms books.In the end though, there's close to no real character development leaving them all flat and fairly uninteresting. Lavan never once really faces his own problems, everyone from heralds to the king himself fix everything for him. The story drags on until almost the very end, where things rush to a rather cliched end. Lackey did a much better job describing the effects of war in The Black Gryphon. Several plot strings go absolutely nowhere. Finally, the relationship between Lavan and his companion is more then a little weird, even learning the true nature of companions from from the Storms books."
3,Not a Very Good Example of Oktoberfest Music,"As manager of ""The Oktoberfest Webring,"" I am always on the lookout for good sources of Oktoberfest music. Unfortunately, this CD is not one of them. The sound quality and the music itself are too uneven in quality. Some numbers are performed by an Oktoberfest band, while others are performed by a full orchestra. Still others are performed by a solo voice accompanied by a small ensemble. This CD would be much better entitled, ""A Potpourri of German Music."" Only when viewed in that light does it provide a tolerably pleasant listening experience."
5,Review,This is great background music for any Oktoberfest party/get-together. Wonderful songs straight out of Germany with a awesome variety of styles and sounds. Loved it! Thank you!
4,"Good, but not AS good....","I greatly anticipated Coheed's soph release. I have to say that I was a little disappointed. It wasn't as good as the first one, but I seem to feel that way about a lot of bands out there. Don't get me wrong, I'm a diehard Co&Ca fan, and the cd is still good, but not AS good. So if you're really into them, you might be a little disappointed, but if you are new to them, you will definately enjoy their unique sound. That is what made me fall in love with them...the fact that they didn't sound like every other band out there. Basically, I can only really explain Coheed as an acquired sound/taste. I definately recommend checking them out, and if you don't have it already, you should pick up their debut album ""The Second Stage Turbine Blade""...it's by far my favorite cd in general."
4,One of the year's best under radar cd's,"I kept hearing about this band all over the internet...finally decided to check it out. I was expecting an emo album, but to my surprise not much emo about it. This is experimental rock, all the songs from this album are a continuation of a sci-fi type story of Coheed and Cambria (the two main characters in this story). Because it is experimental and progressive most people will either hate it or love it. I happened to love it."
4,"Amazing music, recording could have been better",This CD is amazing! A great follow up to Second Stage Turbine Blade. Every song has amazing guitar lines and the vocals are jaw-dropping. My only complaint about the album is the recording quality. It sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement with little more than a computer and a microphone in the middle of the room as the band jammed. If it wasn't for the recording quality this CD would have definately gotten 5 stars from me. One of the best albums of 2003.
3,Its alright,"My friend was blasting this CD when I went over his house, my thoughts through the whole thing was just ""meh""..."
1,are you serious?,how did these guys get a record deal. if youre in a rock band at least sing like a man. dont waste your money on this.
1,What the F%$!?,The singer of this band has the worse voice ever. I think William Hung has one up on this dude.(if I can call him that?)His voice reminds me something of a drag queens. I would not EVER buy this cd.
1,What a bunch of crap!,The ave age of all these 5 star reviews must be 12. Give me a break. This cd and band suck. I am not even gonna waste my time. Do yourself a favor. DO NOT BUY THIS CD.
1,Taking Back Sunday Meets Geddy Lee!,Hey Coheed you're not At The Drive-In so stop with the high-pitched nasally vocals!! You end up sounding like a terrible Ween/Rush hybrid! Who on earth would want to sound like that?!
2,It's not Rush,"Coheed And Cambria is reminiscient of Rush, without the 'Spirit of the Radio'. They hit the pulse of 'pop', not heart."
2,A huge disappointment - you'll regret buying this CD!,"If you're anything like me, you're looking at this page because you saw the video for A Favor House Atlantic and thought that Coheed and Cambria's songs would be just as good, perhaps even better. Sadly, this band is a one-hit wonder. It's the only song worth listening to on the CD, except for Al The Killer. I've heard better. MUCH BETTER. Don't be tricked into buying this CD like I was. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of those 2 songs. All the others are dull, bland, and totally not worth the money. Trust me - do not buy this CD. It's a waste of money. It's hard to like the members of the band, and even harder to like the songs. Spend your money on something else - you won't be missing out on ANYTHING."
5,Wow. Could someone be more ignorant?,"To the user below me, if you knew anything about this band, AT ALL, then you'd realize everything you said was completely invalid. Coheed and Cambria writes concept albums, about a sci-fi (Star Wars like) story. Not about losing girlfriends and cutting hair. -sigh-. No wonder I hate most people.Anyway, I love this cd to death. As do I love SSTB, and will love Good Apollo. Coheed just keeps getting better and better."
5,Wow!,"All I can say about this album is give it a chance. I was actually a little pissed when I first gave it a listen, but then, once I listened a few times, it grew on me. It is now a cd that I can sit and listen to the whole way through (and believe me, that is rare) and it rivals Coheed's first release. I think that if you don't own this cd, it is a sure buy for anyone who loves musical talent, great production, and a band that can play these songs just as well live as on the cd. Congrats to Coheed for making such a good follow up to an amazing first album. Buy it!"
3,pretty good,"C&C are fairly talented compared to most emo and ""new punk"" bands, and their singer reminds me of the guy from Rush. But putting them on the same level as Rush (not to mention Led Zeppelin, as some have mentioned!!!) is ludicrous. Their riffs are repetitive, simple, and often jarring. Not that great"
5,"OMG, AMAZING","This entire album is AMAZING, even blood red summer which is actually one of my favorites off the disc. (i can't believe someone gave that song a 1/5...) anyways get this cd, u won't regret it"
1,I Don't Get It,"What is this music? I actually don't even give this one star. I mean the lead singer's voice sometimes sounds like a child's. It's weird. A lot of times you can't even understand what he's saying. This is definetly the weirdest band I've ever heard. If you want good rock stick to the All-American Rejects they're really good and have great vocals, they're so much better than this band. This band is just plain weird."
1,What's wrong with you people?,"So Micheal Jackson wants to be in an EMO band. This is 100% Genuine Crap. It Blasphemy to even put this band, ""The Used"", and ""Taking Back Sunday"" In the same category. Being a music collector who owns over 1000 CD's I look out for new musical tallent, which this bands lacks. This goes out to all of you conformists who gave this band 5 stars. You obviously have no taste in music. I recommend that no one buys this CD, or any of thier CD's."
1,Awful,"Awful Awful CD. I regret buying this album. The singer is too high pitch. He sounds like a prepubescent boy who cant find his place in life. Do not buy this album if you are looking for some good quality rock. This is a typical modern non-conformist-wannabe album. In reality they just make themselves look stupid and are put in this non-conformist category which really makes them conformists, since they all use the same methods to make music."
1,AWFUL CD,"I must say this is quite possibly the worst band i have ever heard in my life. the singer just has an absolutley disgusting voice, and i do not see any sort of positive musical talent whatsoever in this band."
1,Coheed and Cambira? More like Blowheed and Crapia!,"Seriously, Coheed fails as an emo band. (For those of you who deny they're emo, Wikipedia says they're emo, and Wikipedia is ALWAYS right!) They also fail as a concept album band. The lead singer sounds like he has been roundhoused in the nads too many times, and the story is stupid! It's a Star Wars ripoff. The band members really need to lose their virginity.For a good concept album, check out ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water."""
3,Ummmm......potential.....sort of,"I heard ""a favor house atlantic"", and i said to myself, wow, that sounds like a pretty good band. so, i bought the cd, and the first intro track was just entirely too long, and so i came across the second track. cool drumm fills, and guitar riffs, but NOTHING CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE SONG. it had the same beat and rhythm throughout. So i hoped that the next track would be better. Well, it was a different beat, but that's about it. SO, it's an ok album, i was sort of disappointed, but only perhaps i would have liked to hear more songs like ""a favor house....,"" but you can't always get what you want. Don't buy this album expecting it to sound like that song, you will have the same reaction as I did."
2,coheed is extremely overrated,"man,... i cant beleive how many people think that just because this ablum and band is different that it means its great, this band is basically a ripoff of rush and they do sound like alien ant farm. i do admit that the ablum isnt that bad but it could use some major improvement. and as someone who was at a live show, i can honestly say they suck live, and to top it all off they are a bunch of jerks, if ur a dork that likes fad music and needs something to grasp on to this ablum is for u. otherwise stick to talented worthwhile music that has real meaning to it."
3,Sounds Like Rush With a Heavier Sound,"Havnt heard the whole album only a few songs and the ones i have heard are not all that bad. Only one complaint, and that is the singers voice gets very annoying, and is a little too high pitched for my likings."
3,Dissapointment,"Come On, Coheed & Cambria could of made a better album than this, they just didnt put any effort into makeing this album, but i'll give it some credit, its different from the first album,This album and Between The Buried And Me(BTBAM) Were the Only album's i was waiting for all year, i was in so much hope they would have Stayed with the Emo-Pop-Core sound from the first album ,all i have to say is if you buy this album dont be Thinking Its So Much Like Second Stage Turbine Blade."
5,Ah man this is Claudioriffic,"Coheed and Cambria are just a great band and so yea. This cd rocks so much. The concept of the band is brilliant (Claudio is such a genius) This is just some unbelievable music. I wont waste my time blabbering about how Coheed are the best band ever (with the exception of Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins) because you know the music speaks for itself.The Ring In Return- 2/5 (its just the intro)In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth- 4/5Cuts Marked in the March of Men-5/5 my second favoriteThree Evils- 5/5The Crowning-5/5Blood Red Summer-4/5Faint of Heart- 5/5!! My favorite song!!Backend of Forever-5/5Al the Killer-4/5A Favor House Atlantic-5/5 but a bit overplayedThe Light and the Glass-5/5Hidden Track-4/5yep well you should seriouslt check this album out but get The Second Stage Turbine Blade too so the band's concept makes sense. This band gives me hope for the future of music.Until we meet again, peace"
4,Coheed Evolves,"Although this album is undoubtedly still Coheed and Cambria, it is leaps and bounds over their earlier stuff. The lyrics are still very well written, and continue to tell Claudio's story of Coheed and Cambria, his own rendition of Adam and Eve (this album is apparently part 3 of a 4 part series - Coheed's first album was part 2) The music, however, on this album, is much more well-thought out. The song structures take on a life of their own and maintain a very epic feel to them, emphasizing the lyrics. Where their earlier stuff was mostly standard pop-punk fare, this album shows that Coheed is capable of much more. Highlights of IKSoSE include The Crowing, The Light & The Glass, The Velorium Camper I Faint Of Hearts, Cuts Marked in the March of Men, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth : 3.Pickup this album if you're interested in good music. Definitely one of the better releases this year."
3,Strained assuredness,"There was definitely something appealing inherent in this ambitious group's second prog-rock release that made you want to familiarize yourself with the material. Predicated upon taught guitar lines and gripping vocals, and C&C feel every ounce like that punk-prog medium found between At the Drive In and Mars Volta. But too often, melodies tend to drift off into power chord oblivion, when all too often more energy seems dedicated toward the rock elements over progressive."
1,"Start A Fire, And Then Throw This CD In.","Let me say that my little sister listens to this group all the time. So I am forced to hear this music very often. First of all what is this group trying to resemble? Could anybody out there answer that question for me? This band looks like a bunch of ugly homeless freaks. One is uglier than the next, they look like they reside in a dumpster. The lead singer looks to me to be part bigfoot. Now about their music, if that is what you what to call the noise they make. Well it's not good. I mean the lead singer should change his name to Geddy Lee JR. Why anyone would want to copy one of the most annoying singers of all time is beyond me. Their sound is quite similar to the rest of the current so-called punk/alternative/rock bands aimed at little kids. Take your pick they all sound the same. Perhaps this group thought that the arcane song titles and a annoying voice would seperate them from the pack."
2,Why? - Stop with the junk,"Rock opera? yes. Rock n roll? No. Crap? Definately. This music is way too overdone and the singer needs a serious dose of testosterone. At least jack white has soul. This might be the best band of the ""taking back sunday"" and ""jimmy eat world"" emo-punk-pop genre, but that aint saying much. If your into this type of music, take a step back, take a deep breath, and buy The Kills' album, or the Black Keys, or Kings of Leon for something with real soul. Im getting sick of this kind of music featuring prepubescent teens whining about women and life in the most annoying and immature way possible. The Blink-182 / Yellowcard (also crap) clones must be stopped before they ruin rock forever."
1,yuck,"i first herda coheed and cambria by one of my good friends. her friend came over and she would ALWAYS play this cd!! it's SOOO annoying. his voice is crap, he sounds worse than that guy on Simple plan!! eeerrrggghh. this cd makes me cuss. DONT BUY ITbetter artists:brand newyellowcardavril lavignealice in chainsmetallicasomething corporatesugarcultpanteraac/dc"
3,"good, but...","this is a good cd, don't get me wrong, but i have to say it's lacking compared to ""the second stage turbine blade."" i only give five's to cd's which are incredibly amazing, four's to good cd's, so that's why i gave it three stars. if you're just getting into co&ca, i suggest ""second stage..."" over this cd."
1,A stain on modern music,"It's a darn shame that the average rating for this item is four and a half stars, because anyone with respect for music would rate it one or at least two. Claudio has no talent with songwriting, singing, or with his appearance for that matter because he has a really stupid-looking beard. Whoever told Claudio has talent as a singer is a dolt. IT takes nothing more than ears and a cerebrum to tell that he sounds like a girl, and for that matter a girl who has no talent at singing. But of course the problem with this awful band extends beyond their singer, the music is also entirely worthless. No skill with guitars whatsoever. Also, whether you like it or not this is emo, and the majority of emo is awful. I have no idea why this band gets so much respect while sounding worse than every other emo band out there. This horrible band needs to quit know, they got lucky that people who like bad singers came their way. Lame-o"
1,kill me quickly!!!,"This band is by far the the most excruciating piece of garbage ever to reach my frail ears. They might make some sense if the singer was a skinny little $&@#% or a thirteen year old girl. However, as it stands, he appears to be a dirty shaggy lard resembling a sasquatch's leg. In all, it's nothing but bad news from this cd on. Please...Turn away and never look back!"
5,The Begining Of The Coheed & Cambria Revolution!,"""In Keeping Secrets"" is a great follow up to ""The Second Stage Turbine Blade."" Their first album had a great mix of songs but a lack of cohesiveness. On ""In Keeping Secrets"" Coheed & Cambria stepped it up a notch and made an original concept type album. The work is quite epic and uses great effect like full blown strings and church sounding choirs. Coheed & Cambria are sure to leave their mark on history and this album is the beginning of the evolution. Check it out, you will not be dissapointed!"
2,So-So Emo,"These guys can't decide if they are Metallica or a doo-wop band, and their indecision and inconsistency drives me nuts. The best song on here is ""A Favor House Atlantic"", and here CO+CA show just what they can really do if they put their mind to it, but the rest of the CD is fairly average...oh, and the opening track is REALLY irritating too. In the meantime, while we wait for these guys to make their minds up, listen to Hey Mercedes, The Starting Line and Fall Out Boy if you want Emo bands that really mean it."
2,Unfocused and Uninspired,"I've heard this album in my friend's car a dozen times (he loves it). I find it unbearable...most of the songs have no discernible melody, or drive, or GENUINE EMOTION. I hate this album for the same reason I hate modern R&B music...there is no real passion in the singing or songwriting, only a grand display of pretentious melodrama. Yuck. Listen to a band with actual songwriting skills, like Guided by Voices or The Beatles."
2,Almost!!!!,"For starting so well; tracks 2 and 3 are wonderful, the rest of this cd becomes unbelievably cheesy and generic. Their sound has potential, but the interesting NON-GENERIC format of a few tracks is lost by the crappy-ness of tracks 4-8. I would recommend if people wanted an ""interesting"", ""non-generic"" NEW sound try The Mars Volta's ""De-Loused in the Comatorium""; it is infinitely better than Coheed and Cambria AND much better than At the Drive In ever could have been."
1,lacking,"First album; decent. This has no real growth. Just because a song clocks in at 9 minutes, it doesn't means it's good, or clever; it's just long. Mostly jam sessions, and sadly to say pretentious lyrical fluff. Not horrible, but not worth buying."
1,what happened?,"i don't see how any true coheed and cambria fan can say that they truely enjoyed this cd. sure, there are two or three good songs that are somewhat like songs off of ""the second stage turbine blade"", but that's the only good part about this cd. how does a song like 'blood red summer' slip onto a cd by such a once great band? hopefully this is nothing more than a sophomore slump and not a new trend that Co & Ca is slipping into. i thought ""the second stage turbine blade"" was one of the most brilliant cds that i have heard by a band of this generation and was greatly disappointed when i listened to this new album."
2,something's missing,"second stage turbine blade is a great cd, and this one is just missing the thing that made it great. there's a bunch of just plain goofy crap too, like background vocals on one song go 'koo koo katchoo' like the beatles. i dont know what happened, but this cd doesn't have it. the only track that stood out is track 2."
5,Awesome.........and for the last time its not emo!!,"Thats pretty oxy-moronish that someone spelled ""ignorant"" wrong...and to that ""Christian"" lady,like the other guy said ""Its not meant to be taken litteraly!!"" ...for those of you that dont know, The CDs are soundtracks to the comic/graphic novels that come out with it,so thats why the songs don't make sense!!!!...anyways Coheed roxxx,if you say anything else,well quite frank my dear scarlet""You don't like Rock!!"""
5,BEST CD EVER!!!,"If you think you are a fan of music, you are nothing until you have fallen in love with this album like I have! Not even Jesus could have made a better CD. Buy it and your whole life will change!"
3,Mediocre in comparison to the previous,"An obsessive Coheed fan after i picked up Second Stage Turbine Blade, i ran across this album at FYE shortly after it came out.i listened to a few good clips of their songs, (most of hte few good parts on it, as i came to find out) and I was compelled to buy it.From the title of my review, you already know what's coming...a speech about the disapointment i felt in yet another band putting out a mediocre CD after an amazing first one...so i'll cut to the point.I felt In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 was not as raw and cutting as Second Stage was. i loved the bitter, sci-fi inspired lyrics of the latter, as well as the driving guitar riffs-- and failed to see any comparison with the second album. it was, in my opinion, a more inspired record- truly an epic.However, if you lean more toward a catchier, lighter-core/punk feel...hit it up. I wouldn't recommend it for a die-hard Second Stage fan."
4,"Good Music, But....","the sad part about it is that this band will become every corporate pop punk posers favorite. Hell, we even had a hip-hop guy (AJ ALLEN) in here talking about how he liked the album. *Second Stage...* was a great C.D, and so is this one. But this time around too much exposure could be C&C's Downfall...Mtv Is A Curse That Must Die A Horrible Death..."
5,no complaints,"It's odd, because nothing immediatly apparent as to why i find this record flawless. I saw C&C on the Warped Tour and the music just released something inside of me. I can understand the voice being ""annoying,"" but I sing tenor and so it's not a problem as far as I'm concerned (and the best rock vocalist of all time, Robert Plant, really kicked his voice into ""high"" gear). Despite any complaints, I can't find flaw with this album. Is it the best album ever? No. But it's probably the most consistent and impressive thing put out in 2003 (I say probably 'cause I didn't do a full run-thru of the year before writing this). Now, I don't see the point in getting indignent if you don't like something, and it's silly to assume that people are gonna see ""this album sux! don't buy it!"" as an intelligent comment and really take you seriously. I mean, how can music make you angry? It's easy to avoid, and easy to like if you take down that big wall of bias you're building."
4,COHEED & CAMBRIA,DYNAMIC AND CHALLENGING - AT TIMES A LITTLE MEANDERING - BUT OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE LISTEN.
5,Product is as described and easy to use,This Mic shock mount is a perfect fit for the MXL 990 Large Diaphragm Stereo Condenser Mic. It grips the mic with just enough tension so that it doesn't come loose but not so much tension that it makes it hard to release like some of the older shock moounts used to. Attaches perfectly to my DR Pro DR-210 mic stand.
5,Perfect for my MXL Condenser Mic,"What can I say? It fits like a glove. And it should, it's designed specifically to match the dimensions of my MXL Condenser Mic. Not only is this a secure way to hold your mic while recording, but it also is an easy way to load and unload your mic when you're on the go."
4,Shock mount works great for upright position (but I have a question).,"I have a question about this shock mount. First it works great! My voicebooth (which is almost finished) is a converted closet with limited space, hence I have to be very thoughtful about how I configure it. So here's my question(s).Since the included shock mount holds the mic by simply squeezing it, is it safe to turn it upside down from a micrphone stand (so the micrphone points toward the floor)? If not, could you please recomment a ""screw in"" shock mount that would work with my VO: 1-A?"
2,review,My wife and I ejected this DVD after half way through and planned to throw it out. I later figured I'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it. The last guy is good and I won't throw this away now; he does a bit on throwing up that is good. Most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny.
3,Good for amateurs and beginners,"I just test-ran this camera all day:-Although it managed to take some shots well, the metering is not very good overall. The pictures seem overexposed.-The menu mode is very basic. (Could be a PRO for beginners).-There is no viewing prism. It can get annoying to always look at the LCD screen.-When zoomed in, WITH OPTICAL, the images come out pretty grainy. This is strange with an optical zoom. It should really only be a problem with the digital zoom, since digital zoom just crops and magnifies the image itself, thus losing image quality.If you just want to take snapshots or are a beginner with cameras, you may enjoy this camera. If you are more serious, this camera will probably be a let-down."
4,A good camera for the price,"Good for my intended purposes. I use it mainly for close-up shots. The video is good, but NO SOUND! (it does not have a built-in microphone). It uses two AA regular or rechargable batteries (saves money on batteries). The built-in memory is handy if you don't need a lot of memory (at any one given time), but it also has a memory slot for an Olympus XD-picture card (a negative, since it is proprietary)."
2,Disappointing...,"I just bought this camera today, and I am very disappointed in what I just spent $180 on, plus $50 for the memory card.It has a movie mode, but NO SOUND! What is the point of making a movie if you cannot hear it?The much-advertised in-camera help feature is basically non-existant. If you can even find it, it is not much help. Plus, the ""basic help menu"" the give you in the box is VERY basic, only telling you how to put in the batteries and take a picture. They give you a ""advanced help menu"" that you much install into your computer. It did not work on my computer, neither did the photo editing software they give you.I would not reccomend this camera, unless you don't care about anything but taking very simple pictures."
2,much too small,"I was very disappointed because I had expected something bigger so it could also hold several games. On the upside, it is sturdy so it is protective for the gameboy. It ust doesn't hold enought games."
1,Not enough info given...,"Who would think that a babies changing pad would need dry cleaning. This isn't mentioned in the description but is on a tag on the changing pad. Again...who would think that something that needs cleaning on a regular basis would be dry clean only. I purchased this for my granddaughter and when they received it they washed it immediately so they could use it. (All baby items need to be laundered prior to use) Much to our dismay, the cover was ruined. The patterned area separated from the rest of the cover. I called customer service and they would only remind me that the tag says dry clean only and they would look into putting this info on their product description. The one star is only because it is beautiful but certainly not useful."
5,Awsome,"The fabrick was not only beautiful beyond the picture, but the fabric was NOT cheap nor the product cheaply made. Great product, would definately purchase from the same place."
1,Horrible,"Trigger Man came with two other PS2 games, so I paid around $3.50 for the game as I would have never bought myself. The game has an interesting plot, but it has bad graphics, reminding the original Nintendo games. I don't recommend anybody buying it."
3,Annoyingly hard,"I haven't had to ""read"" story dialog since the early days of the Zork I,II, III games. On the PS2 system this is absurd. There should be voice samples or some animation for the cutscences, no matter how horribly they manage to accomplish it. The first level was annoying and I'm on the second and I'm so frustrated I don't want to bother with the game anymore. Any game has some merit, and this one CAN be fun. There is not much aiming involved, you can do head shots if you are lucky. Ammo is pretty hard to come by. Game play is suprisingly ok. Some games like syphon filter(ps2 version) have horrible left analog stick aiming control, but this one performs well enough. Overall, besides frustrating, this game is alright it you get it very cheap, I'm talking under $5 with shipping."
3,another lame game,I RECEIVE this game and i was not expecting much.and i got just what i thought.if you enjoy mafia then this one for you horrible graphics .clumsy control and super boring.i have stop playing it twice it so sluggish and dull.19.99 is the right price for it .maybe nine dollar to much.
5,Good Hands-On Book,"This volume is the best hands-on R book I could find which opens the door to lm() in R. The book is thin and the contents somewhat dense - there is no room for hand-holding: you need to learn the basics of R and statistical modeling elsewhere. But if you meet the prerequisites, buy the book, read it, and most importantly, TRY THE EXERCISES!GOOD POINTS- exercises (deserves 5+ stars for learning concepts with real data)- short chapters, so you can quickly test your understanding via exercise- chock full of R examples that you can try with library( faraway )BAD POINTS- proofs are not rigorous enough for mathematicians, but too dense for practitioners (who would prefer more intuition)- helps if you have played with R a bit and understand basic statistics- no answers to exercises"
2,Seems to work,Tethering the ball was not a good idea with boats aboutSecond ball was broken and enzyme pack leaked into carton. threw contents in pondalgae seems much less
3,Better books are available!,"This book is supposed to provide its reader of an introduction to International economics. As this book is mostly meant for students who are just getting to know the subject, the authors should have been more clear and they should have made it more attractive. The lay-out is pretty boring, and the graphs are often confusing and not well explained.New developments, such as voluntary export restraints, etc.., are only covered briefly. The contents also focus too much on small,open economies and not on larger economies. This makes it especially unattractive for US students."
4,"nice, but...","I had to guess at the size and luckily they fit pretty well, but aren't quite as warm as I was hoping. If I had it to do over again I'd get the larger size and use a liner glove inside. These might be good down to about the mid 30s."
5,Great for Cold Weather,"I love Ragg Wool gloves and these are very comfortable. I usually get them with leather for grip, but these use grip pads that serve the same purpose, but with greater flexability."
3,A good glove when it's not windy,"I have some issues keeping my hands warm in colder weather, and after reading a bunch of reviews, decided to give these a try. My first reaction after pulling these out were ""Wow, these are bulky!"" They aren't discreet, so if you wear them in 40+ degree weather, you'll probably get made fun of.My experience is these are good down to freezing, but after that, if you have issues with cold hands, they may not be good enough. I recommend trying to find some mittens and something that will keep the wind out.Also the black grippy things on this glove suck. The ones on the fingers keep coming off, but not completely so they are hanging by threads. It's super annoying.A good glove for the money, but not as warm as you think."
3,Very good primer marred by numerous language gaffes,"Mr. Ruiz is to be commended for producing a thoughtful and engaging overview of contemporary Colombia and the book is the best of several I've read so far in terms of providing a basic orientation to this conflicted land. Unfortunately, the text is marred by numerous language errors, typos and editing gaffes. There seemed to be a problem on every other page; this creates an unacceptably high annoyance level for any attentive reader. This is a great shame, because apart from these easily correctible problems, the work as a whole shines."
3,The Colombian Civil War,"English language studies of the insurgencies plaguing Colombia are few and far between and Mr. Ruiz's treatment of this subject helps fill the void. Unfortunately, his work is based predominantly on published english language sources, mainly newspapers and weekly news magazines, omitting the many outstanding works of prominent Colombian scholars such as Gonzalo Sánchez, Ricardo Peñarando, Fernando Cubides, Donny Merteens, Daniel Pecaut and Eduardo Pizarro. The book also lacks objectivity, tending to favor the insurgents by accepting without scrunity, self-serving pronouncements by the FARC, ELN and other leftist organizations. While disappointing to academics working in this area, The Colombian Civil War is useful as a primer for readers interested in the causes, dynamics and persistence of the Colombian insurgencies and the influence of drug trafficking on this complex situation."
4,You Can Let Go Now: It's Okay to Be Who You Are,"This book by Mark Chironna is very interesting and enlightening. The style is a little choppy, as if it was dictated rather than written. The content is excellent, however, and I would recommend it for every committed Christian."
4,An Enduring Classic,"This is a deep, rich, fragrance that opens and is filtered through with one of the finest bergamot citrus openings surrounded with an authentic array of herbs and vetiver. Deep, dark, quiet, and elegant, this fragrance transcends fashion trends in fragrances. Although it originated in 1971 when Yves Saint Laurent was at his height as both an exclusive couture designer, and also as the finest designer of mass market clothing for both men and women of all time. Although not offense in any way, it will not appeal to everyone. Before you decide, try it and wear it all day. It is still made of impeccable ingredients, and packaged in the originally designed spray bottle, which itself is a finely executed design fit for travel. It can currently be purchased for $30 to $39 for 3.3 ounces, which is an astonishing bargain considering its quality."
5,"Now for the recording, please!","I love this tape which I taped from cable. (Cinemax Sessions, which unfortunately they don't do anymore. They had another brilliant one called ""Black and White Night"" with Orbison, Springsteen, Costello, Bonnie Raitts, etc. which is on cd). However, this is not on cd and I would dearly love it because the music is so great from Mark Knofler, to Chet and Emmylou, the Everly Brothers, Waylon and Willie and a lovely song by Chet about his father. I play this tape all the time, due to the fact it's not on cd. What a shame."
5,Guess What? I have this show on DVD!,"Amazon isn't showing the fact that this 1986 ""Cinemax Sessions"" show is now on DVD. I bought my copy from The UK. I have been watching for these session to start coming out on DVD. Cinemax had a series called ""Cinemax Sessions"", of one hour shows, all featuring industry leaders, in 1986.I just recently purchased another DVD from their series called, ""Fats Domino and Friends"", with Ray Charles and Jerry Lee Lewis. I recorded both of these with my VCR in 1986 (I have no idea where they are today), but there were others as well as the afore mentioned two. What is REALLY nice is the DVD picture and sound are FANTASTIC, since the shows were all well produced and were archived until recently.As I said, I saw each of the shows when they were first broadcast and they were great, but with the digital picture and sound (through today's electronics) they are truly SPECTACULAR!"
2,Better if sold as dvd,"Noticed too late that it came in VHS format. I dismissed my VHSplayer long ago.Solved the problem loading the video down from the net.Anyway, the concert is intereresting as I was looking for more info and videos of the great Chet Atkins."
3,mediocre soul album,"I found Javine's talent quite promising and her singles were ok. Unfortunately the rest of the album is rather boring and even a bit pop-ish. You can find a re-do of Jade's ""Don't walk away"". Javine just won the pre-election for the Eurovision Songcontest. She will start for the UK. New hope for her career."

5,As Time Goes By,"This series has been on PBS. On viewing a couple of episodes, I just felt that I would like to see how it all began. These discs are just what I wanted. I would recommend the series. As to the content; the cast is terrific and the story line is a work of art."
4,A good start to an excellent series.,I bought the first two seasons for my mother for Christmas because she loves the series. I give these two seasons four out of five because the character and plot development started a little slow. It is still a good start to an excellent series.
1,steaming mad,the disks were missing.. just got an empty case soooo mad!!!!! I know getting used is tricky but I expect to at least get the disks
5,As Time goes By,I really enjoy As Time Goes By. I first saw it on PBS and still watch it there every saturday night.
5,This is a marvelous series,Everyone should watch this series. I'm so hooked on it and I know I'll view the series over and over.
5,a marriage made in heaven,wonderful british romantic comedy. warm wit and wisdom - Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer are a perfect foil for each other as they build a love story in the great English tradition of verbal repartee.
1,Research,"One star is too high here. With very few lights in this speech except that there is a hidden agenda, which is agreed upon, but he basicly relies on research from the burnt Library of Alexandria. If this is to be taken seriously, there needs to be more research than this. Just using Library of Alexandria to base attacks on problems is not researching nor is it giving your audience any direct substance. If research is not improved, he is doing more harm than good. Stay away from this guy."
1,Crap!,"I'm tired of paying for movies that have interesting promotional tags, but are nothing more than a badly video taped conference."
4,What more people should know,I thought it was quite interesting and not enough people actually see this sort of thing to know what is really happening around us at this point in time.
2,Good.... but its a dust-o-phile,Its a good fit for my iAudio. All the opening are at perfect locations to enable you to operate the instrument effortlessly.But there are some drawbacks too:- The material is such that it attracts dust a lot. Its not like the clean case shown in the picture.- The clip behind is as thick as the player so that increases the bulk of the product. Clip it on your belt and it will project out.
2,These make me dread stopping and starting,"Getting clipped into these pedals is a chore. After every intersection, I'm always trying to flip the pedal to the correct orientation to clip in--these aren't weighted reliably enough to do that on their own. It's difficult to get lined up without looking down, and I often think I'm aligned, only to have my foot slip out when I apply pressure. (Isn't that the sort of thing clipless pedals are supposed to prevent?) Not only that, but these are difficult to get out of as well, even at the lowest tension setting. Also, it took an inordinate amount of fiddling to get the cleats aligned so both feet feel the same and so as not to hurt my knees. These pedals are just a huge hassle all around. I can't decide whether to try more expensive pedals, or just to go back to platforms..."
4,Nice pedal,"For the money, I don't think you can do better. Easy in, easy out, really no trouble and just enough float. I like these and the look style is the easiest to learn for those new to clipless. Don't be scared. If you're ready for the switch to clipless this is a good pedal. You won't believe the difference in speed and power from your clips."
4,Solid,Just started riding more seriously and they work well. Like that you can use it with out clip-ins on casual days (flip-flops are great)
4,Solid pedal choice at a good price point,Not as light as the Ultegra or DuraAce alternatives... but a fraction of the cost. Equally functional for my everyday training bike.
5,Excellent pedals,Just installed and rode on these for the first time. They are excellent. Had been using SPD mountain bike pedals on my road bike for years. These are so much more stable and efficient. Also like the fact that the correct cleats are included with these.
3,Harder to clip in than SPD cleats and hard to adjust,I am sure it's a learning curve type issue because I learned to ride clipless with two-bolt SPD cleats. I bought new shoes that only worked with three bolt style cleats thus the purchase of these pedals. I will eventually get the hang of it. I am also worried about the durability of the plastic cleats when I do have to walk in the shoes.
3,do the job,definately just an entry level pedal. great value for the price so if you're just gettting started these will serve you well.
4,Good solid pedal but too much float,"First of all, for $43 plus tax this is pretty unbeatable value. I bought a Motobecane bike on-line as it represented good value and after completing several hundred miles with the free SPD pedals and cleats, I wanted a larger platform from which to pedal from.The R540's have not disappointed, very easy to clip in and out of, no need to look down constantly unlike my old SPD pedals. The pedals have a nice large platform and can also be used with normal shoes.I knock off one star for the cleats provided. I do not want fixed cleats as they will batter your knees but the floating ones included have too much lateral play for my liking. A cleat in between their current floating and fixed designs would be ideal."
4,Reasonably priced clipless pedal/cleat combo,"These were my first set of clipless pedals, and I have to say I'm quite pleased with them for the money. Sure, there are lighter options out there, but I bet it would take an extremely experienced rider to notice the difference. Adjusting the tension on them is easy, as was installing the cleats with the included hardware. Make sure the shoes you buy are the three hole design, and you are good to go. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because it takes some practice to get in and out of them. However, for the money, it's hard to go wrong."
4,Great starter pedal,This is my first pedal I have purchased for riding with shoes. I have used it twice. It is a little tricky at first to lock into but I am getting the hang of it.
4,great service,"pedals work excellent, received a dud bolt by chance, shimano very respectfully shipped out a new bolt the same day"
4,Great price- and great so far,I've put about 60 miles on these clips so far and they've worked perfectly. Great price- easy to install. No problems at all.
4,fins to feet for both artists,"When I first heard this was coming out, it seemed an unusual pairing. When I learned it would be all covers my interest was even more piqued.Upon listening and taking some time to digest, I like it quite a bit, although it is a departure for both Tortoise and Will Oldham. Tortoise with vocals? By necessity, they adopt a more conventional approach to song structure. And Oldham outside of his alternative folk mantle, singing Springsteen, Elton John, and the Minutemen?""Thunder Road"" trounces the overwrought original, and ""Cravo e Canela"" could go on twice as long without any complaint from me. ""Daniel"" and some of the other songs are less successful, even bearing a whiff of kitsch for kitsch's sake -- but overall the performances are solid, the selections are diverse, and the delivery is superb."
4,GBV side project,"Guided By Voices side project consisting of Robert Pollard, Nate Farley, and Jim Pollard. On the Rockathon label, and limited to 500 copies.Track Listing:1) You Learn Something Old Every Day2) I.B.C.3) I'm Dirty4) It's A Bad Ticket5) Satyr at Styx & Rubicon6) Is It Mostly? (it is mostly)7) Where is Out There?8) Fruit Weapon"
2,Body Fluids and Electrolytes A Programmed Presentation,"This book seems to be ok, although I didn't find much use for it in my class even though it was part of the recommended text list. The pages are rather flimsy, but it is easy to read, the parts I read. The spiral binding made it easy to lay out on the pages that I did use while looking at other texts at the same time."
5,Good for a review or if you're in nursing school,I used this for a review for a refresher course and found it to be a good aid. It makes the math and drug calculations pretty easy to do.
5,Peace for over an hour,"I haven't any issues with the pbs thing playing. It jumps right in.If you put this into your computer you have some CD-ROM aspects too like coloring pages and games.You can play any episode first and it will play that and the subsequent episodes in order.I have a screamer. He sits for this. I am a happy mom.P.S. The Canadian way people in the video never say ""yes"" they say ""ya"". I'm American it's a bit annoying to me to hear my two-year-old yelling YA!"
4,Caillou DVD,"My son (3) loves Caillou and I bought this DVD as it was a nice price and if it is possible to wear a DVD out that will happen soon, good stories good value for money>"
5,2 yr. old Loves It,My 2 yr. old Loves watching Caillou and they run back to back for the entire length of the DVD.
4,If you like Caillou,If you like Caillou then this DVD is for you. my son is obsessed with him probably like everyone else and this DVD is on repeat that he already knows it by heart. mommy is already sick of it but it also gives me some time to get things done while this holds his attention..
2,"High Expectations, Dissapointing Return","I expected this book to be filled with well written, interesting stories. I was sadly mistaken. There are a few gems in this book, but overall I was disaapointed with it's content. This is the kind of book you should read if you are bored and don't really have anything better to do, not the kind of book you read through and just can't put down."
3,Erotica?,"I thoroughly enjoy lesbian erotica, so I really looked forward to this book. What I found was that there are several stories that absolutely don't fit the genre. Others are marginal. There are many which do qualify, but I must say, there were also some that I gave up on after a page or two. As a second-hand book, it's probably a good buy, but I sure wouldn't buy this new!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this product based on its glowing recommendations. I was particularly interested in pulling in some weak AM stations around my area. I already had a Sony ICF-M410V, which did a decent job, but was hoping for better/clearer reception. What a surprise! This model couldn't even pull in the stations I was interested at all. I even put it side-by-side with the Sony just to be sure there wasn't anything special about the receiving location. I finally decided it must be a bad unit and sent it back via pre-paid shipping for an in-warranty replacement. I received a replacement without any hassles (kudos), but the replacement wasn't any better. I'll stick with the Sony from now on."
3,Know what you're looking for...,"When I ordered the Sun-Glo Wax I didn't realize there are different levels of speed for the shuffleboard table, so blindly ordered the wax here on Amazon. When I got the wax in, I excitedly spread it along the table and expected the puck to fly across the table and it went about a foot and then stopped because I didn't realize that this wax is one of the slower shuffleboard speeds. Sun-Glo does make the faster wax speeds, but, unfortuanately, I haven't found them on Amazon."
5,Powder wax,Works very well on our shuffle bowl machine. I would highly recommend this product. I could not play the machine without some type of wax and this is perfect!
2,"Not as effective as I thought, overpriced","While I am a big fan of the bitter apple spray, I am dissapointed by the gel. I'd though that being a gel, it would stay effective longer and I could avoid repeat applications. That is not the case. This product is no more efficient that the spray and it costs four times as much per ounce."
3,DOG TASTE DETERRENT,"I had gotten this in gel rather than the spray type to put on furniture, as I had 2 puppies that were VERY interested in one table leg. It really didn't do any good, and did not even slow them down. I have used the spray form when I had a dog that was chewing on an itchy spot or a foot with good results. I was not as thrilled with the gel."
2,pathologically boring!!,"This book is well written. But that's the only positive thing I can say about it. Of course, back flap texts are often too optimistic, but in this case, where the reader is promised much suspense, it is downright misleading. Basically, this book is about sickness; throughout the book the author goes on and on about the bad leg of one of the characters, the effects on health of invisibilty, medicines, hospitals, doctors, prescriptions, vitamin cocktails, etc., etc. Apparently, the author is obsessed by health and sickness, and treats the unexpecting reader to an quite hysterical overdose of it.Apart from this, the book is extremely conventional, with a very weak plot. I have finished it, but it took an great effort!Conclusion: not recommended at all!!!Marc Verhoeven,Tokyo"
2,BLIND READER?,"I have to wonder if I read the same book as other reviewers did. At any rate, I found this book one long, redundant mess of cliches, derivative plotting and characters. McGregor spends so much time rambling on about how each character feels being invisible to the point of where it's like come on, get back to the action. What little action there is doesn't compensate for the long, unimportant passages. Reni's character is especially whiny, and the character of Luis is so overboard, it's funny. First of all, why would anyone (even the Shaman and his friends) want to be invisible? What is the goal?Dean Koontz does this kind of thing much much better."
2,"Hmm, government conspiracy, secret lagoon, invisible people","Hmm, government conspiracy perpetrated by evil, power-mad scientists, secret lagoon in the everglades, a scientific process that creates invisible people (and one invisible dog) - I finished the book, but if I were you, I think I'd pass on this one. Unless maybe you are in middle school (kids might enjoy it) or you're a diehard conspiracy theorist."
4,Moves fast.,"T.J. MacGregor won this year's Edgar for best Paperback Original with ""Out of Sight.""More of a SciFi/X-Files type, rather than a mystery read to me...but quite entertaining none the less.Being a sucker for all government conspiracy theories, I was hooked from the start.A shadow national security organization is funding a ""mad scientist"" type who has perfected a process that can render people invisible.One invisible subject escapes and three more are zapped by accident. Their quest to bring down the covert project while being hunted by the shadow organization's thugs is classic cat and mouse.Some great characters on both sides...extremely fast paced...superb South Florida settings. A bit too long, but with a suspension of disbelief, this is big fun."
3,good writing props weak story,"MacGregor is a good writer-- she can best be described as a leaner, New Age Dean Koontz. Unfortunately, her story is a fuzzy feel-good formula that could have benefitted from some solid background detail-- some more insight into government experiments on invisibility, whether scientific or pseudo-scientific, would have helped a lot. And for all their expertise and high-tech gadgetry, the government agents are remarkably inept and slow-witted-- a little research into special forces training and government secrecy would have helped a lot here. So if you're looking for believable characters and exciting chases, by all means read this novel.Just don't examine the plot too closely."
5,See And Hear It All Explained,"For some reason this documentary seems to put that entire horrible day into perspective. To know exactly how those planes entered the towers, how they hit, why the fire was so intense, why people jumped, why the towers collapsed, seem to satify that angry, sad itch people have to just want to know ""how"" and ""why"". It is also touching at points, especially when irony is obvious when an engineer states that ""even a 727 could not knock over the building"". It's heavy stuff, but seems to answer some questions that are nagging at so many Americans."
3,"Comment on review by tagman77 from Bountiful, UT","While I appreciate tagman77's passionate editorial on the events of September 11, 2001, it lacks an actual review of the DVD.This style of writing is more ""Letter to the Editor"" than anything else and didn't give me any indication as to what the DVD is actually like.Any other reviews out there?"
3,Best book on threads and sockets for Java,"I bought this book on the run, and just sat in on my shelf. But then I needed write some threads in Java and I found this to be the best book around for this subject. Very clear. (My threads work great!) The chapter on sockets is also most useful."
4,If you program at night you should have this book,Late night Advanced java is for the programer that does cool thing all though the night. It will show you have to work with sockets and other networking things and it is also great for the new programmer in the block
1,"Disappointing, and out-of-date.","I found this book rather disappointing. Several of the examples are plain wrong, I wonder how the author ever got them to work. The IDE toolkit reviews are interesting, but went out of date very quickly after publication so are of amusement value only. Finally, it only deals with Java 1.0. JDK 1.1 came out fairly shortly after I bought the book, and with no information about the new event handling system, the book was unfortunately obsolete."
