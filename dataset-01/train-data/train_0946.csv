3,Has a chance to be great!,"This ""PikStick"" or 'grabber', as my granddaughter calls them, is of good quality. It's problem is that it requires a good ten lbs of grip strength to have it work properly. Also, the action is jerky, again making it difficult to use if your hands aren't wonderful. I will try WD-40 on it next. (Post WD-40 - MUCH better action. I'm ordering two more.)"
3,Not what I'd hoped,"Although I ordered 2 of the sane thing-they were shipped in 2 seperate, large boxes(at least inefficient, if not stupid).Tis item does NOT have a trigger-lock, although the descriptive copy inferred that it did; and the shaft IS lightweight, but at the expense of strength and rigidity. In other words, it may be worth the $5.99 (+S&H;)I paid for it, but certainly not more.Overall, it's O.K., but I will need to take any further descriptions with a large ""grain of salt""."
4,It's a pen refill...how excited can you get?,"It's a Mont Blanc pen refill...not too much to get excited about aside from the fact that Amazon sells it much cheaper than Staples or Office Max. So far, the refill has performed well and has lasted over 1 month of routine use in my Mont Blanc.I docked a star since it seems to smear a little easier than the original insert that came with the Mont Blanc."
3,Worked great for a very short time,"Only worked for about a week of moderate daily writing (school), then either ran out of ink, or the ball got stuck. Either way, shouldn't happen."
5,Mont Blanc Rollerball Pen Refills,The product was provided directly to my house and of the same quality and for the same price that i'm used to in office supply locations. I paid a premium to receive the order overnight but that's to be expected.
5,Good,Good price. Nice black refills. Capable of writing both right handed and left handed. Package opened very easily. Will write with them.
5,Good as replacement,"Very good refills, price and delivery. Everything according to my expectations. Good quality, quantity and exactly as I need. I recommend it for replace purpose. My choice was a black refill and it is working well."
4,Too reminiscent of Anne Tyler,"Lively can and has done better. This novel was a little too banal for my tastes. If she had swapped the English countryside for Baltimore, this would have been an Anne Tyler novel ... BO-RING!"
3,Heat Wave,"Penelope Lively is a wonderful writer, taking us into the thoughts of her characters with intelligence and humanity. Unfortunately, this particular novel doesn't live up to her usual storytelling. There is too much description of landscape and extraneous detail that takes away from the story which, when boiled down, isn't that complicated unlike The Photograph which punched you in the stomach and made a lasting impression. So much so, I read it twice."
2,VERY mixed bag; only for those who loved Bonnie Pointer!!,"This cd tries to give the listener a quick sampling of the diverse approaches the sisters tried through the years, but really falls short of being a satisfying collection. Stick to either the RCA box set or the single RCA 'best of' from 2000.However, if you liked/loved Bonnie Pointer's solo contributions, (like myself), this may be worth the price of admission!! This features her fab hit 'Free Me From My Freedom/Tie Me To A Tree (Handcuff Me)' and the equally fab 12 inch (dance) version of her remake of 'Heaven Must Have Sent You!' These are hard to find, but here they are, remastered and sounding really good.Still, proceed with caution..."
1,Logitech camera,"Recieved this camera, connected it and took three photos as a web cam before it quit working.It registered no connection. All was checked, including me downloading new drivers.It was to no avail. This refurbished camera is junk."
2,Too vague with many errors in later chapters/sections,"This book covers many of foundations of abstract algebra including groups, rings, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, Sylow's theorem, Galois theory, etc. While most of the sections are fairly well-worded, most of the text is vague and the more challenging problems are given without too much training on them in the section's text.Also, I found the algebraic coding chapter very difficult to read and understand. Durbin does a lackluster job at clearly explaining the concept of coding theory. There are also many errors in the answer key which definitely lead to confusion especially for newcomers.On a positive note, I found the section on frieze and crystallographic groups an icebreaker in the seemingly endless blurb of unclear information."
3,"Good Exposition, Poor Problems","This is a nice book overall. Clear exposition, good examples, and not too thick. I personally found the problems lacking in motivation and scandalously simple, which made it difficult for me to complete my homework sets (if you ain't learning nothin', it ain't worth doin').Another good point is that it contains a number of sections introducing more advanced topics (galois theory, algebraic coding, finite fields and field extensions, symmetry and crystallographic groups, and more).So this book probably is great for an introduction to the subject, just don't look for anything exciting."
5,Either his best or second best album of the 90's,"This album was an incredible way to start off the 90's...amazing songs, perfect arrangements...his voice is romantic, and at the same time playful and enchanting...This is either his best or second best album of the 90's...along with ""40 y 20"""
2,low view of scripture as Gods revelation,"In Song of Solomon, the author treats the OT instruction of God as inaccurate and beneath todays moral expectations. It's borderline Marcionite in view of Scripture as not useful in those bad old days. I recommend purchasing from amazon instead Expositors on Song of Songs, or Garrett's NAC commentary. Both are excellent language resources."
2,Leans allegorical,"I purchased this commentary to help me preach through the Song of Songs. The author views two main male characters to be found. Solomon is the secondary person and a ""dark force in the drama"" (page 246). The woman is a member of Solomon's harem but is in love with someone else.A major issue to be addressed is the allegorical vs. literal interpretation. The author spends a good deal of time stating the issues and determines that it is not necessarily allegorical. However, the author seems to embrace this method.Two thumbs down for someone preaching through the book."
3,Griz,A good table top book. Skims over the technical aspects of the firearms used during the middle 1800's on ward. Nice photographs. Not meant as technical manual/reference material.
3,Ok but not great.,"I've always heard about the legendary Oum Kalsoum, so I sprung for a ""best of"" album. It is ok, but not great. Definitely not her best. I was expecting more orchestral backup, and may be some more variety. But the basic stuff is here. I enjoy listening to it."
4,Surprisingly Solid,"This sure ain't the Outlaws as you knew them back in the 1970s, when Henry Paul was a vital member. But Hughie Thomason has carried on, found a group of talented new musicians, and released this surprisingly solid album. It took me more than a decade to ""discover"" it, but I look at that as just another case of ""better late than never."" Many examples of The Outlaws trademark guitar jamming can be found on here, but there are also some real songwriting gems such as ""Steam on the Blacktop,"" which ranks as one of my very favorite Outlaws songs of all time. It's one of those ""sticks in your head and hum it all day"" types of songs. All in all, this is another quality album from a band that has always deserved more acclaim than they have received."
3,Good little book,Nice way of owning a historical book at a low price. Provides an excellent read for anyone interested in Masonry from a Brother's point of view.
5,"Forget all other diet's, this is the only one you will need!","I started using this book one year ago in April. The meditations and quote for the day is all it took to put me on the right path for weight loss. As of today, I have lost 83 pounds, and no longer worried about my next diet. This book has made me understand that God is the only help I need with weight loss. Each daily meditation only takes a few minutes, then there is a little story about someone's weight loss struggle, a quote for the day, and a section to write down your own thoughts. This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it for anyone struggling with their weight."
2,Some good and some bad,"I found some passages quite good but others seem harsh and critical. Examples of passages: ""Excessive eating is selfishness, and selfishness is a sin."" ""If we ignore our bodies, the gift that God gave us, then we show contempt for God, and He will lose respect for us."" I found a much more supportive book in FOOD FOR THOUGHT, DAILY MEDITATIONS FOR OVEREATERS by Elisabeth L. I find I need more positive meditations."
2,ok,Well I read this for a couple of days and lost interest in it. It did not reach meto where I really want to keep reading it daily. Someday I will get it out again and try.
1,Boring and self-absorbed,"This review refers to the unbridged audio CD version of this book. I listened to the first two discs but couldn't continue further. Diane's voice makes me very uncomfortable. This book is about THEIR marriage. It is not for everybody else. All the time they are talking about their life together, which is just a small portion of the typical lives of marriage. And they talked sooooo many details, which bored me. It's like you lived their frustrating life again. Unless you and your partner are exactly like them - highly uncompatible at the beginning, this book cannot provide much useful advice. Actually, I was wondering what motivates them to write such a book and if anybody else except them will ever enjoy reading it."
2,Poor reading - at best!,"And here I was hoping to find a solid foundation to fight of the creationsists. The book is more philosophical than scientific, and it is very very DRY reading. He does have some points that are good, but you have to be awake to notice them. Not for the casual non-scientific reader!"
4,"A good case, but won't reach most creationists","Kitcher does an excellent job of showing why evolution is science and creationism isn't, but on the whole it's a better apology for scientific thought in general than for evolution in particular. His arguments are likely to reaffirm the convictions of evolutionists worried about creeping creationism in our schools, but Kitcher doesn't connect with creationists and his arguments won't convert many of them. By the time he argues (p. 190) that he sees no compelling theological reason for preferring a literal interpretation of Genesis vs. a more liberal interpretation that would allow for evolution, Kitcher has shown that either he didn't intend to speak to creationists or he doesn't know their language well enough to do so. A book that better argues the points and counterpoints of evolution vs. creationism on grounds that creationists will understand is Futuyma's Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution."
1,Not the case it claims to be,"Kitcher's book continues the unfair diatribes against any scientist who questions the sacred cow of evolutionary theory. His so-called case against the creationist model fails to establish its case because the plain fact is, as more and more evolutionary scientists are privately admitting, the case for evolutionary theory continues to crumble in the face of ever increasing legitimate scientific knowledge. As is the case with all anti-creationist books, Kitcher attempts to settle the question by defining science only within the framework of naturalistic philosophy. Evolutionists hate it when this fact is pointed out; nevertheless, it has been sufficiently documented by such writers as Phillip Johnson. If Kitcher feels so strongly that creationism ""abuses"" science, he should debate a top-notch creationist such as Kent Hovind, Duane Gish, or Johnson."
1,The Other Side,"I admit having not read this book. However, I believe if someone is going to read a book attacking Creationism that person should also see the argument from the other side. I understand the author has talked about Creationism in this book. I'm sure he gave it from an evolutionists point-of-view. You should see Creationism from the Creationists point-of-view. A good suggestion of the Creation Science Evangelism Seminar by Dr. Kent Hovind. You can find it at chick.com or drdino.com. It's seven video seminars. He also has a bet going on. A large sum of money to anyone with any scientific evidence supporting evolution. Maybe you should check it out."
4,Great for new teachers,Gives you a foundation and focus on teaching. Very helpful in my content area reading class and this is not a book I will sell back
3,i loved the 80's,"hey there!!i hope this finds you well.one of the many things i loved about the 1980's was the tv mini-series.i have ordered my of these since they have now been released on dvd.this was one i saw and never forgot.yes, it's a bit cheesy, but it is still a lovely sunday afternoon movie.it arrived on time.it plays great in my dvd machine."
1,Did not arrive,Product never arrived and when I asked to have it resent...it was on backorder with no idea of when it would be available.
3,"Brandy's Fine, but there's more","Wanted to name my daughter Brandy (After the song of course) but ""Karlee"" won out on a toin toss with my wife.Always was interested in this ""Looking Glass"" band. One hit wonder? not really after hearing the the ten tracks on this CD.After one listen, you'll probably like 60-70% of it (if, you of course like the Brandy hit). Many of the other songs of similar style.Similar to? Sounds somewhat like Stonebolt, and some tracks sound somewhat like blood sweat & tears. Lite pop music. Apparently their live show was much heavier.Weakness: This band (like many bands) seems to be split by two personalities within it. Which makes the direction not too focussed. Are they lite pop, R&B, or a little heavier??Elliot Lurie made all this happen. (The obvious talent). By the way, Brandy was apparently written about a girl whos name was 'Randy.' Brandy definitely sounds more radio friendly.B. Kuz (Winnipeg, Canada)"
4,Brandy,"Brandy was a great song and a great girl, but take time to listen to Jimmy Loves Mary-Ann especially if your a musician because the chord progressions are nice."
4,Easy Listening,"I would consider this CD ""Easy Listening"" compared to what I usually listen to. It's not heavy, it's real smooth. And of course, always loved ""Brandy"" and singing along to it. It always reminded me of ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" which is a wonderful movie."
4,Looking Glass,"I never had or heard this particular album before but if you like Looking Glass try to find a cd (or album) called ""Subway Serenade"". It has ""Jimmy Loves Marry-Anne"" on it but all of the songs are awesome ( I like them anyway )."
2,"Two Great Songs, Two Stars","Brandy and Jimmy Loves Mary-Ann are two spectacular songs. They are worth the whole price of this CD. They had better be. The rest of the album is worthless. There is not one memorable song on the rest of the album. But, so what, I've listened to these two songs about 50 times and they are beautiful. I know that so-called ""one-hit wonders"" is a common pattern in pop music. But, how could any songwriter have two musical ideas as outstanding as these, and then find himself with nothing more to say?"
2,articulo completamente desactualizado,"este es un articulo ideal para alguien que no sepa absolutamente nada de paginas web, pero aun asi la informacion esta completamente desactualizada por lo que es una perdida de tiempo"
4,Relective Material is Sloppy,"I like the helmet color. Actually, I had emailed a request to Bell/Giro this previous summer to create a helmet in the hi-vis green that has become so popular in recent years. While they did get back to me on another matter, they never did notify me that this color was now available in the Citi helmet. I found it accidentally while surfing the web."
4,"Comfortable, all around helmet",This helmet is comfortable and I dont notice it while riding. It sits sort of high on my head. This is the first bicycle helmet I've purchased and I cant complain.
5,Livesaver,"I was riding my bicycle on a residential road when I was hit from behind by a car going about 35 MPH. I was told later by the driver that I went over the hood and into his windshield which broke when I hit it. He told me they found bits of my Bell Citi helmet in the windshield when it was taken out by the repair shop. I still have the helmet and I can see where the rear part of the helmet was impacted. It did a great job of absorbing the impact and saving me from serious brain trauma (note, I did suffer a concussion and blacked out for a bit but the CAT scan showed no serious brain injury and I was released to go home the next morning). I will absolutely be buying another Bell Citi."
5,"Fit, fashion, fentilation, err... ventilation","OK, so I cheated on the alliteration, but this is a fine helmet. The fit is great, very adjustable, easy to adjust, and continues to ride well after hours of wear. The fashion is right - subtle, simple, slick, not flashy but stylish enough. And the ventilation is what I need - full enough for a warm summer day doing a bit of uphill climbing. The brim works for those sunny days and is enough to deflect a bit of rain or wind. The strapping is comfortable and seems sturdy enough to do the job when called upon. All in all, it's a good price for a good solid product. I'll look for another one in a few years (I replace my helmets periodically to avoid breakdowns in the plastics.)"
5,Great fit and look,"I have a Bell helmet that I could not get to fit correctly and I didn't like the pointed back style of the helmet. I found this helmet and ordered it due to the adjustable fit and rounded back style. I have a large size head and the helmet adjusted and fit perfectly. I'm afraid if my head were bigger it wouldn't have fit. Aside from that, it's a great looking helmet and well made. To put things in perspective, I typically wear a size large to XL motorcycle helmet."
4,smooth helmet,got this helmet because it has fewer holes than most others. needed it for rain/weather element protection not for cooling off in the winter... can be adjusted and I like the visor but isn't big enough for me. Rounder helmet style is less common than flashy aerodynamic speeder helmets.
4,Comfortable,"Very lightweight and comfortable. The adjustment headband dial works well, once you get the hang of it. The straps are the ""Y"" design and adjust fairly easy thanks to the quick adjustment locks. It got a little warm while riding in 70 degree weather, but not too hot. The quick adjustment dial came in handy when I wore a skull cap underneath it in 40 degree weather. It looks a little like a hard hat with holes and sits higher on the head than I expected. The visor looks bigger in the picture, but when I have it on, I can just barely see the tip when I look up. Overall, this is a good helmet for someone who doesn't want to spend too much or look like an spaceship landed on your head."
5,More Than Happy,"I was reluctant to wear a helmet, until I found the Bell Citi on Amazon. The reviews are positive so I bought one. It is so comfortable I don't hardly know I am wearing it. The cooling effect is unbelievable I think it keeps my head cooler than not wearing anything. The cool air seems to be like little cooling fans all over my head. It is almost hard to believe or explain. Buy one and you will not regret."
5,Good helmet,This helmet comes with very good instructions that show you how to correctly adjust it so that it can protect your head properly. When I ride with it on I don't feel any heat build up. Good ventilation.
5,Yellow Bell Citi Helmet,"I'm a bike commuter and this helmet definitely suits my needs. I chose the yellow because it was on sale at the time, but also because I think it's more noticeable. It matches my yellow Novara jacket perfectly, which isn't quite hi-vis yellow, but a little brighter than it looks in the picture. There's reflective tape on the front (where it looks white in the picture) and I really like the spot in the back that you can easily attach a light to. I have a small head so I almost had to return it, but it fits on the smallest setting."
4,Bell Citi Bike Helmet,"I like the adjustability for exact fit, but not in love with the style. Should serve the purpose I bought it for, protecting my head."
5,Great helmet,"Looks great, at least compared to most helmet which tend to look pretty dorky. Fits great, comfortable, and feels sturdy."
1,too small to use,The problem with one-size-fits-all is poor fit for most. This helmet was too small for me and too wide for my teens.
5,Great fit,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a casual bike rider and have not owned many helmets. The last one I owned was simply the one offered at the shop that I bought my bike at that fit. So when I noticed that the pads had completely deteriorated and the outer shell had a small crack I went looking online for a quick replacement. I thought I would opt for the cheapest one I could find but after reading reviews I picked this one. I'm so glad I did, it's so much more comfortable than I thought a bike helmet could be and very easy to adjust for a good fit. Well worth the money!"
3,Bell Helmuts,"I purchased two of these; one for my spouse and one for me. We bought the mirrors that attach to the sunvisor separately. The helmut and mirror seemed like good product with Consumer Reports approval as a best buy; the firmly attached mirror was also an excellent idea especially if you have tried other helmut-mirror attachments. Within two weeks the device that tightens the helmut to make it fit had broken on one helmut. The mirror is very small; it is satisfactory but does not provide a very clear image. Fortunately (or not) cars and trucks are big enough to be seen easily in the mirror. Most of all, the mirror stays put and seldom gets bumped so that constant relocating is not much of a problem."
1,The fit is awful,"This helmet at first glance looks like a great value until... you try to put it on, if you have a head that's bigger than, say, a peanut. ""Universal Sizing"" is NOT universal in the case of this awfully designed product. Don't buy it."
1,Simply the Worst Book Ever,"Reading this book is by far the most boring thing I have ever done in my enitre life. I would rather poke my eyes out than ever read this book again. The plot consists of a girl named Afrika, a slave who is trying to escape to Canada. Simultaneously, a completely unneccesary, boring side plot is thrown in about a girl named Lucy, who is a selfish brat who cares only about herself. The entire book she complains about her sister's wedding. Only during the last few pages does Lucy contribute anything at all to the main plot. If not for Lucy, this would be a mediocre book. Whatever you do, stay clear from this book."
2,Alright....,"This book, I found was to be good, interesting, yet boring. It didn't have much action, and it was kind of dull. I liked to story, and I liked how we got to know the characters, but this is not one of my favorites. I am glad I read it, because it was intersting, but I don't think people, like me, who are not to hot on history, would enjoy is as much as some other of Kathyrn Laskey's books. By all means, go read it, but just remember, if this is the first book of Laskey's that you have read, go for a better one first. Thanks."
5,True North,"When I started reading the book True North, I really thought it was a very good book. The novel was about two girls who meet and were both headed North to freedom together. My favorite part of the book is when the two girls meet and traveled North to freedom with courage. I really liked the ending of the book because life changed for both of the girls."
4,Great Book,"I loved this book. It is about two girls, one Afrika is running away from the plantation she works at in Virginia, and the other girl, Lucy is a wealthy girl in Boston who` s best friend is her grandfather. In the story Lucy finds out that her grandfather halps with the Underground Railroud. After her grandfather dies she finds Afrika in the grandfather clock in her grandfathers office. She helps Afrika the rest of the way to freedom even though it is hard and they run into some road blocks. I liked this book because it helps you to understand how it was like for people back then. I loved this book and I would deffinetely suggest it to someone else to read."
3,A delightful tale of two teenage girls in the mid 1800's.,This story is suspense-filled and moves quickly to reveal a delicate plot that is easy to follow but takes some mind to fully comprehend. This is a great experience for anyone interested in stories of the Underground Railroad.
2,Common Sense,"I wasn't very impressed with this book. The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style. I don't think anyone who has an imagination will get much new out of this book. Also, it gives you song lyrics without the tunes/music, which isn't very helpful. While there are some good ideas, they are too few to make this book very worthwhile."
5,Excellent!! No new parent should be without it.,"Just when you thought you knew all the games to play with your baby, you read this book and realise there is SO much more!"
4,highly welcome,A valuable addition to the Osprey Elite series. Author Simon MacDowall covers the Germanic Warriors from 236 to 568 AD. The chapters: Chronology -- The warrior society -- Leadership and hierarchy -- Training -- Equipment and appearance -- The warrior on campaign -- The experience of battle. The book is beautifully illustrated by the well-known artist Angus McBride.
4,Koskin adds a little luster,"All of Caselogic's cases are good at what they do- hold your media safely. Koskin (what does that word mean anyway?) is an interesting material that feels like a cross between leather and rubber. It's an alternative if you are tired of nylon. It's not as if Louis Vitton started making CD cases, but it's pretty cool. And no animals were killed to make it."
4,Tales of Eternia for the PSP (Europoean Only Edition),"First, I want to say that it is a shame that this game never came to the United States. This is an exciting RPG from the makers of Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss. The combat system is one that takes a little getting used to, but is one that is easy to master. The story is another plus, with likeable heroes and despicable villians. To complement the excellent ingame visuals, there are a bevy of CG cutscenes as well as an anime intro and conclusion. I hope that you get the chance to play this well-crafted adventure because I think that you won't be disappointed."
5,The Tales continue,This was released in the US as TOD 2. I have been a TOD fan since the very first one released in the US having played and enjoyed most of them (except for Tales of the World and Tales of Legendia) this was one of the better games in the series. Learn the Summons quickly and rule the game!
5,Looks great and is very durable!,This action figure is great! Very durable! Legs and arms can be removed! Although I wish the elbow and knee joints could move. Just what my son wanted. Looks good compared to others I have purchased.
4,Toy Player,"It was wonderful to see that it was in such great shape, and the child loved it. On time delivery also."
3,Careful.....little parts,We love c-3po. He comes apart and is a lot of fun....Pieces are small and can be lost very easily....
1,I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Never buy this toy plz!!!It's worse than any toy I like had! So never,never.never,never,never ever buy it!!!"
1,seeing is believing,"I am a huge fan of Robin Williams. I love to watch his stand-up routines, his comedy specials, and his movies. HOWEVER, there's one big thing you need to consider before purchasing this album, something I did not consider. Listening to Robin Williams' stand-up comedy without accompanying video is like watching other stand-up comedians without sound. Half of his jokes end with silent actions, as he does his spastic convulsions, facial contortions, and other spontaneous slapstick. It is utterly frustrating and confounding to listen to an audience roar with laughter, while you're sitting there wondering what Robin Williams was doing, and why this stupid album wasn't recorded with a camera.With audio only, this is just not very funny, or fun. You will spend a lot of time frowning, and only occasionally laugh when a joke comes along that didn't involve actions. The album is a worthless relic of the 1970's."
4,"Item is great, but too expensive on Amazon","Item is as described and does what it is supposed to, however, paying over 8.00 for this is too much. I saw it 2.00 cheaper at my local Wal-Mart."
5,Costly,"Hello - If you have a Staples located near you, they are currently on sale for $3.00 (3/23/10). I'm not sure why they are selling here for $8+ because even without the sale, they do not cost that much. I love these types of post-its as I use it with my cross-stitching as an organizational tool for all of my colors and needles. I use them to not have to change needle thread everytime I need to but instead pick up another needle with the color I need. Extremely convenient and much more efficient! I'm sure that there are many uses for these little guys."
5,"Amazon has lowered its price, I believe","The best thing about this product is that it does its job well.There were several negative reviews on the price of this item. I hope those reviewers looked carefully at the item count to be sure they were comparing it to other prices for 500 count package. I have seen this kind of package at Staples with 125 count priced almost as much as this 500 count package. When I was at Staples, I bought their house brand, and I find it not as good as the Post-it brand for stick-to-itness, although they were nice for being transparent (but not as easy to write on). I'm delighted with the big packs, because I use them extensively for research writing. I only wish they would package them also in a single color. I can never come up with a way of dividing flagable topics into five categories so that I use colors at the same rate."
3,not the right colors,"Colors of post-it that came in the package are not the ones shown on the picture. Don't like the orange I received, I was expecting blue."
2,Do not buy it!,"500 sounds a lot, but is only a small package. I think it worthes 1 dollar only!! You can find things cheaper and nicer from Walmart"
5,Love this book,I have the original that my parents bought back in 1964. I just found another at a Goodwill store for $1.99!!! Giving that one to my mom.
5,More original rock from Canada,"Wow... I'm almost speechless. This CD contains some of the most original-sounding rock I have heard for the past decade. Who do you compare it to? You can't compare it to anyone, becuase nothing has really sounded like this before. It's a bass guitar, a drum set, and two voices. Absolutely amazing, the talent that these guys have. All the tracks are awesome, but standouts include Going Steady, Blood On Our Hands, and Little Girl. I hope these guys are recognized in some way, because this is the best purchase I have made in a long while. Buy this CD... Do It."
5,Good stuff,"Nice mix of dance-punk and indie rawk with some hardcore, thrash, and funk touches thrown in for good measure. It's all uniformly solid, but the standout track (for me, at least) is the groovy, Rapture-esque ""Sexy Results"". Also, it helps that, unlike a lot of musicians doing this kind of thing (and there are a lot these days), these guys skillfully walk the line between aggressive and abrasive and catchy and accessible."
5,pretty much genius...,"This band is absolutely amazing live, and all killer no filler on record. Catch them any way you can, you won't be disappointed."
4,Sweeeeet,"Awesome high energy songs from this Toronto duo. Danceable, fun and generally just rockin.Track list:1. Turn It Out2. Romantic Rights (1st single)3. Going Steady4. Go Home, Get Down5. Blood on Your Hands6. Black History Month7. Little Girl (my favorite)8. Cold War9. You're a Woman, I'm a Machine10. Pull Out11. Sexy Results"
3,Energetic premise wears thin,"Flashy, splashy, though extremely minimal with a mere two members, this debut definitly got noticed last year, if not for every single standout track, for the overall fuzzed panic attack that was more danceable then anything compatriots Queens of the Stone Age put out. Though the melodic language does become repetetive and monotonous, standout tracks lets this simple formula shine without all the unassertive derivations found throughout."
4,oroginal,"were do i start? this cd is incredible. its another strong fact that candian music doesnt suck. staright rfom toronto these guys are musicans who are recrding stuff that ive never herd before. i mean two piece bands are rare today, but a two peice that consists of a singing drummer and a distorted bass? their lineup isnt only one a kind but so is there music. and it seems like these guy would also put on a kickass live show. if you get the chance too, see these guys live, and buy this cd."
3,"Not for chewers, indeed.","This is a cute puzzle, with nice sturdy knobs for a young toddler to grab. However, as everything goes in the mouth, these aren't great. I'm worried now that I'm reading they may contain lead :-/ The pieces aren't solid wood or handpainted, but rather a cardboard-like printed material adhered to particle board pieces. When chewed, the surface comes right off. We have to watch her closely when playing with this to make sure she isn't gumming the pieces."
3,not solid wood,This puzzle is NOT solid wood. It is very OBVIOUSLY made with particle board. It came full of saw dust too! The pictures are laminated and my 1 year old daughter had put the pieces in her mouth a lot...as most 1 year olds do. It is already peeling. The poor quality makes me wonder what toxic chemicals she may have ingested. Shame on M and D!
3,not impressed,"Love the design and concept, but mistakenly believed that it was a painted wooden toy. It is actually stickers on pressed board. Bought this for my one year old twins, who put everything in their mouth, in doing so the stickers were runied. over all not impressed."
2,Stickers? Really?,"I was really disappointed to discover that the pictures on the puzzle pieces are stickers rather than being painted on. My child played with this for only a few minutes before one of the pieces started peeling. Otherwise, I like the look and feel of this product. Too bad..."
5,FUN ENTERTAINMENT,"THere isn't much to say other than Melissa & Doug make reasonably priced wooden puzzle boards for young kids. We have about six of them, and they last through the years - highly recommend this brand. They are nice and big pieces and not cheap."
2,"Great Puzzle, but Cheaply Made!!","I saw 5 of these in babies r us and ALL five were scuffed and or cracked. I ordered online from amazon in hopes to get one in good shape, but the one I received was cracked and scuffed as well. I guess the puzzle is just cheaply made. But I like the large knobs for a toddler, just wished the quality was better."
3,Not for chewers,"I like a lot of Melissa & Doug's other toys. The toy itself is a great idea... but I found my son being able to chew pieces of the wood away pretty easily, and the image which just sits on top of the wood comes apart even easier. My son already had ingested some of it and I had to try and remove the remaining flakes of peeled away farmers foot from his mouth."
2,Not for Lil mouths!,"My son, age 11 months, loves this toy. Unfortunately I don't let him play with it anymore. It's constantly has wood particles falling off every where, and he's still teething, so he tries to put the puzzle piece in his mouth but it has this sawdust like substance all over it. No matter how much you wipe it away, it still come back from him trying to get the piece back in its slot."
3,My son loves it but it's not good for chewers.,"He is around 16 months and still likes to put everything in his mouth. As he has gotten older and has more teeth he can be quite destructive. The problem with this toy is, it is layered with some kind of painted paper. It didn't take long for my son to start nibbling away the edges. It is durable because it's made of wood obviously, but the images on the pieces come off easily.Anyway, he really loves carrying the pieces around and banging them together. He doesn't understand the concept of puzzles yet. I show him how to put the pieces in and he just takes them out (over and over =D). It is one of his favorite toys to play with but it's hard to keep it out of his mouth. I would recommend this for an older/more advanced child - under supervision."
5,Melissa and Doug Jumbo Knob Wooden Farm Puzzle,My grandson loved this gift. He is 10 months old and he can grab the pieces easily. He also loves the farm animals.
1,Contains LEAD- Potentially toxic for your child!,"I bought two of the Melissa and Doug puzzles and decided to test them for lead before letting my 9 month old chew on the pieces. This type of puzzle came up POSITIVE FOR LEAD using Lead Check swabs! I would rethink buying one of these as lead exposure has been linked to numerous health problems. This company claims to offer safe, non-toxic toys that they rigorously test for the presence of chemicals. I was initially glad to find toys made from ""wood"" rather than the usual plastic. After finding lead in this puzzle meant for toddlers, I am appalled at how little we actually know as consumers in this country. Please do not give this puzzle to any child! Who knows how many other Melissa and Doug products contain the same materials... they have certainly lost a customer in me!"
2,Puzzle is not solid wood,"The description of this puzzle says, ""solid wood"" It's not! It's 2 layers of composite board glued to plywood. The fibers easily scrape off along the edges and can be ingested by your child. The pictures are a laminate overlay that can easily be peeled off. Not a great puzzle if you child is still putting toys in his or her mouth."
1,Cheaply made toy.,"The idea of this puzzle is wonderful. However it is made incredibly poorly. The edges of the animals and farmer are rough and shed endless wood debris. I have tried wiping the pieces down with a damp cloth, but the edges keep shedding.I would love to find a puzzle made out of solid wood and not the thousand layers of plywood that composes this product. It's simply annoying and messy, do not spend any money on this toy!"
2,"Great toy, but NOT handpainted","This puzzle is cute and a great size for little hands. However, it is NOT handpainted. The pictures are stickers. If your little one is still mouthing things it will quickly disintegrate in their mouth. I also can't imagine that they will last as long as the originally handpainted puzzles."
1,Not up to par.,"I had an older Melissa and Doug puzzle Knob farm puzzle. It was great! Solid wood, nicely cut out. My son loved it. We lost a couple pieces so I ordered a new one. I was very disappointed. The workmanship was shoddy, the pieces were poorly cut out. NOT solid wood, when my 11 month old son chewed on the piece it was like cardboard and puffed up. The old puzzle was painted. This new one has a cheap looking sticker on it that peels off. He has more fun playing with the pieces of the old one, than the new one."
1,Annoyed,1st I don't understand why when searching for this product on Amazon I was directed to this vender where it is 3 dollars more expensive then one from Amazon and a pain to return. 2nd The puzzle I received has wood splits all over it that are not depicted in any picture I've seen of it. Not Happy!
5,Best CD of the year!,"Awesome Awesome album. Tony Lucca is truly an artist who loves doing what he does. It's great to see a person so passionate about his music be able to share it with the world. Every song is written straight from the heart. This album is a mix of rock, country, jazz and blues. No matter what type of music you listen to, this album is a must have. Tony is definitely going to be around for a long time to come."
5,Finally... a musician with something real to say,"For those of you who don't know, Tony Lucca has been around for years and finally is getting the recognition his talent and dedication to his craft deserves. This album is not just about great music, it's about songs that have meaning and inspiration to all its listeners! I could go on and on about how good this album is because it truly is that great, but it's the kind of music you have to experience for yourself! It's well worth it. Congrats Tony on a great album!"
5,One of the greatest artists you've never heard,"With his smooth voice and unique guitar riffs throughout ""Shotgun"", I guarantee you'll find yourself listening to it on repeat on a daily basis. When you hear the passion and feeling in his voice, which is also conveyed through the lyrics, you'll find yourself falling in love with this very talented singer/songwriter. Songs to look out for include ""Someone To Love You"", ""Catch Me"" and ""Rollercoaster""."
4,"Waiter, separate checks.","This Frank Sinatra album, arranged by Billy May, features a lot of up tempo swinging songs, many of which are about dancing. The only ballad on the album is ""The Last Dance"", which fittingly was the closing song on the original album. This is an excellent album, with Sinatra singing at the top of his form. The CD adds four bonus tracks, all also arranged by Billy May. They include the two fun duets Sinatra recorded with Keely Smith, who was the wife of Louis Prima, the man she usually sang duets with. Sinatra fans will dig this album."
4,What Was The Engineer Thinking Of?,"In this 20bit reissue, the Capitol engineer really screwed up with the extra track ""It All Depends On You"". It is from the ""Sinatra's Swingin' Session"" sessions and NOT as listed from a Billy May session earlier. The original CD resissue was correct, how could this alleged expert mess up so badly? We pay and pay and pay these recording companies as they reissue ""New and Improved"" only to find out it ain't that way, Jack. This kind of stuff really pisses me off!"
5,My all-time favorite Sinatra album,"I grew up listening to Frank Sinatra. In fact, it wasn't Sunday morning without Frank serenading the family at breakfast. This CD is my favorite. It is swingin' Sinatra at his peak! I think I played this LP until the grooves wore out! A must for any Sinatra fan."
2,Not what I was hoping for,I guess I don't dig old blue eyes enough.. Oh well. I thought I would enjoy the big band sound but on this cd it came off as annoying and harsh. Plus I know how conceited this guy was and it takes away from me being able to enjoy his talent sometimes.
4,Fun Fun Fun,"I took a clip from ""Somethings Gotta Give"" for my Windows system closing music at work, and tho my coworkers are no Frank fans, they actually danced every time it went off. Its a swinging album. Its not as deep as Wee Small Hours or Only the Lonely, but it does allow Frank to soar here and there. Really is good for dancing, I've enjoyed it much."
1,Horrible,Not that I dislike jazz but the songs on this CD are so....what's the proper term? Jazzed up? Than they are often unrecognizable. The ones that ae recognizable are almost always so upbeat that they sound nothing like the beautiful music that they're suppose to be. There is no way i'd recomend this recording to anyone. Listen to the clips above and you'll understand what everyone here has said about this CD. It's just bad
1,What IS this CRAP?,"GARBAGE!!!!!!!!This is NOT The Phantom of the Opera - It's JAZZ!!! Which is fine, but there's one problem: Its NAME is ""The Best Of Phantom."" IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA!!!!! At the very least, the name should reflect this, but it doesn't. Jazz is a splendid art form, but ""Jazz"" is Not - I repeat: NOT in any way, shape, or form synonymous with ""The Phantom Of The Opera."" Get the REAL soundtrack. Its worth the money, because this is pure GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Instrumental Phantom of The Opera,This is an instrumental version of the great music which makes for great background music or dinner music like in a restaurant. It is very listenable and not intrusive with vocals.
1,NOOOOOOOOO ! AAAARRRGH ! SOMEBODY STOP IT !,"I do NOT recommend this CD. But don't take my word for it.Just listen to the tracks. It's been ""jazzed up"". Not thatthere's anything wrong with that. I like Jazz. But not revampedlike this. What's next the Phantom done in Rap? ""Stop messin' wit' a good t'ing."""
3,"Nice, but unrecognizable","I must confess that I have never heard the entire CD but I listened to the clips above. I like jazz very much, and I don't think that this music is ""garbage"". It's very pretty, but it's unrecognizable. Some of the songs, ""Music of the Night"" and ""Point of No return"" are recognizable. The three stars are for the wonderful and complicated piano playing."
3,Does the job,"Its alright, you would have to buy two of them and make it a habbit to use this product if you have an old and rusty system."
2,Product not as featured in picture,We ordered this beanie baby for my daughter. She has Iggy in blue but wanted him in purple. When Iggy arrived he was totally teal blue. We contacted the seller and they refunded our money but we wanted to save someone else the hassle. Only order this Iggy if you want him in teal.
5,"Very Expensive, but high quality","I paid less for a 26"" Dora Doll (not fisher price), but my 2-1/2 plays with this Swiper more. Go figure."
3,A lot of the Same,"I had the first yoga deck and thought I would expand and buy this one, for some more positions. I was quite disappointed when I found that a lot of the cards where actually the same as the first deck.(and a few names that were the same that didn't match up with the position and vis versa, which when trying to combine positions from both is also confusing and a bit annoying.)"
1,Source Naturals,I could use your help with this item. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS CHITOSAN. Please advise on my next steps to either have my money returned or get the product.
5,More than hot ears and sore throats!!!,"Don't be fooled by the title. This is a comprehensive resource book of considerable scholarship, with up-to-date references and state-of-the-art notes on therapy. For its depth, references, and pearls, it is far better a resource than the Barnes Manual for internists, family practitioners, and academicians who find themselves confronted with sick patients."
5,Great book for Ohio gardeners,"Ohio is not the most hospitable place for gardening. With cold winters and hot often dry summers, gardening can be a balancing act. This book is a terrific guide for selecting and cultivating plants in this area. This book has helped me improve my black thumb to almost green. Recommended for all Ohio and surrounding areas."
4,A good guide for the new or esperienced gardner i Ohio,Enjoyed this book and refer to it often. My only complaint is that the binding is not good for a book that gets this kind of use.
4,the travels of an aging poet,"The one word that would best characterize this work is ""reflective."" Basho adopts a reflective attitude to everything around him as he makes numerous journeys back and forth across Japan, with his students in tow, stopping at famous shrines, visiting old students, and remembering famous teachers or writers, or historical events. It's a slow moving book, but one that really seems to capture the mood of the man who is writing it - he is an aged man of letters, making his way slowly around the country, wondering where his last days will occur.It may not be for everyone, but I found it quite beautiful, and poignant."
4,Wonderful but not for everyone,The Japanese poet Basho is one of the great poets in history but is little known in the West. That is a shame. This small book is well worth reading and the Introduction makes it intelligible for Western people. To really appreciate it you should read it slowly and try to absorb the deeper meaning.
5,The Narrow Road to the North and other Travel Sketches,Arrived well before the estimated date of arrival. The copy in good order and I am hanging on every footstep of Basho's journey.
3,Interesting reading but beware of anti-Lincolnism,"Mr. Masters has written a biography that definately tarnishes the mythical image of Abe Lincoln. An exhaustingly researched book, it falls into the trap of constantly deriding Lincoln for everything he did. In Mr. Masters' mind, Lincoln was a devil incarnate (which was not the case) who didn't do anything right. Anyone who reads the book should keep that in mind. The book, however, is worth the time to read in order to learn more about the 16th president of the U.S.A. Be prepared, though, for Masters' bizarre anti-religous rants."
1,Not history,"This will be short. If you are an historian, both Masters' savage and Carl Sandburg's fawning accounts are a must, but only because you are an historian. For truth, avoid both these extremes and read David Herbert Donald. If you believe that Masters' view of Lincoln is valid, then you have read nothing else substantive on Lincoln, or you are a neo-Confederate for whom truth means. ""The South shall rise again."""
5,Great ideas for HR consultants and general professionals,"I found the book to be chockful of helpful information--particularly the checklists, personal evaluations, and learning games and tools. I also liked the step-by-step instructions on everything. Very well organized. Easy to find things--just want you're looking for to solve a key issue or use in a special training class."
5,One Great Book,"I have recently purchased Elaine's new book and it is wonderful! Very helpful for our work environment, everyone in our office has read it and it has helped us greatly. I would recommend buying all of her books. Thank you Elaine for all your help!"
3,Content of Soundtrack,"Even though I have'nt yet purchased the actual soundtrack. I'm going to. I wanted to comment that the disc seems to have listed all the songs I was interested in. I have searched other movie soundtracks only to find that it only contained a couple of the songs featured in the movie. Or portions of.I enjoyed all the music from the movie. I'm not a heavily religious person but I love the upbeat and lively gospel tunes. And the ""Rap"" songs, some people interpet genres differently. This album seems to have a wide variety.I wondered if it was available in the mp3 format. Usually its listed on the same page."
4,Coen Brothers,"When these guys make a movie,they also make a great soundtrack.I'd give it a 5 if it didn't have the ""rap""in it."
2,Piano Background Music,"The ""old time gospel"" is all well and good but, what I want/need to know is what is that beautiful piano background music that meanders so eloquently throughout the movie and where can I get a recording/copy of it?!"
2,Bah,Just save yourself some trouble and get a soul stirrers album. This album is MOSTLY littered with garbage.
3,"Fine Compact Leica Trinovid Binocular, But....","The Leica 10X25 BCA Trinovid binocular will appeal mainly to hikers and other nature enthusiasts who need a compact, relatively lightweight, binocular with a narrower field of view than a wider 8x20 model. However, having handled this binocular as well as its wider 8X20 sibling, I have found that it is not nearly as bright as the rival Zeiss Victory compact binoculars, and is not nearly as easy to focus. If you are seriously thinking of purchasing this type of binocular, I would strongly recommend instead looking at the Zeiss Victory compact binoculars or their equivalents manufactured by Swarovski."
5,This product is very good for storing CDs!,"I really liked this product because it was flexible; I could carry my CDs well in it, and the color stood out from my other things. It's also very easy to open because it has a zipper."
3,Petmate Nap of Luxury Bed,"Item came by time specified, very easy to assemble, took only about 2 minutes. The only downfall is, it doesn't have much cushioning, which Baby Nemo (that's my cute little yorkie), didn't like much, so for now I have to place his old bed on top of this one. I'm gonna have to buy some sponggy material like at a crafts store like Garden Ridge, to make a ""mattress"" for it, since it's hard. You can feel it by placing your hand on it and feel the metal bedframe. Baby nemo loves laying on his back, so this is one thing we both did not like. For this reason we had to rate it only 3 stars, if not we'd rate it 5 stars. Other than that it's cute, everyone we showed it to thought it was so cute and wanted one for their dogs."
1,Static,Mic static on other end calls say its hard to understand me and the up button don't work. Tried Skype options to adjust audio settings and used the USB Audio Device for speaker and a different Microphone for the Mic and calls say much better statics gone and tryed Skype Test call works fine with other microphone under Options audio settings chanced Microphone back to USB Audio Device Test call has Static. The Up only works when it wants to the down works fine and all other keys on phone works. I have to say its junk.
5,authentic,"What I really liked about this book and others by Palmer is that you can tell she lived in Africa. It makes you feel like you have visited there too. Also I love how her ""mama"" uses scripture all the time in a very natural way as if the Bible is so a part of her thinking that her answers always rely on scripture for support - I wish I were more this way myself."
5,Don't be put off by the title!,"An ideal book for anyone who wishes to begin learning Delphi (version 4, 5 or 6). I an experienced Visual Basic programmer and purchased Delphi 5 hoping to use the on-line documentation to learn Delphi but found it too advanced and not an ideal learning environment. (On-line help tends to be a great reference tool but it's always hard to learn from.) I then purchased the Delphi Developer&#65533;s Guide, which seems to be regarded as the best book on the subject. Although a superb book in its own right, its not aimed at beginners. I have now completed the Sam&#65533;s Delphi 4 in 21 days, and let me say, it&#65533;s a terrific book for beginners, which teaches in a lesson format, which is actually surprisingly easy and fun to follow. Don&#65533;t be put off by the Version 4 title either, all the lessons work just fine in Delphi 5."
3,21 days just to dream not to learn,"At first I was very exciting of learning delphi. Although I studied turbo pascal at past and I know about coding in pascal programming it was still impossible for me to make programs at delphi after this book. The writer must change the name of the book as ""Teach Yourself Delphi 4 in 21 Weeks"" and then he must make the book contain more details about programming."
4,Great for beginning. The delphi help does the rest,"I have been programming in Delphi for a year and a half now. I started out with really bad books and the quirky Borland manual. I snagged the book the moment it came out. The book does very well in the explaining department. The IDE is explained very well and so are OOP fundamentals. After you finish the book, the VCL help (F1) should be enough. When you want to jump to windows API programming, the win32.hlp is an excellent (free) tool. I really recommend this book if you are just starting off, with a wee bit of programming knowledge."
2,Lacks Object-Oriented Pascal,"If you want to know how to make forms look good, this is the book for you! If you want to learn Object-Oriented Pascal, look elsewhere!I write code for a living. Most of the people who tell you this book is great, are non-professionals who are ""playing"" on their computers in their basements. As a ""pro"", I can tell you that if you want to do this for a living, you have got to have a thorough understanding of the underlying code. Just being able to create forms with buttons and drop down lists ain't gonna cut it in the real world. Learn O O Pascal elsewhere, keep this book as a reference."
1,I Definately did not like this book,"After reading all the reviews this book had I was very surprise to see how terrible this book is. Make sure not to buy this book I was very very disapointed, it is supposed to be for an intrudoctory level, but this book is way below that, the only person who should by this book is someone who has never used a computer. This is very disapointing considerint other Sam publication. Botom Line DON BUY THIS BOOK"
4,GOOD BOOK FOR DELPHI BEGINNERS,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. IF YOU ARE A PROGRAMMING BEGINNER, DON`T BUY IT. THERE ARE MANY BASIC PROGRAMMING SUBJECTS IN THIS BOOK THAT AREN`T EXPLAINED VERY WELL, GO AND FIND SOME BASIC PROGRAMMING BOOK FOR BEGINNERS.IN THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU ARE A C++ BUILDER, VISUAL BASIC OR ANY OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PROGRAMMER THAT WANTS TO LEARN DELPHI, THIS BOOK WILL REALLY HELP YOU GET THE BASICS OF THE BEST AND MOST POWERFULL DEVELOPMENT TOOL THAT IS DELPHI. IF THIS IS YOUR CASE, DON`T WASTE YOUR TIME AND CLICK THE ADD TO CART BUTTON RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!!THE END OF CHAPTERS EXCERCISES AND QUESTIONS REALLY HELP YOU TO GET THE KNOWLEDGE.ANOTHER GOOD BOOK FROM KENT REISDORPH!! GOOD JOB!!"
2,DB_SQL ARE NOT VERY CLEAR BUT IT STILL NICE BOOK TO BEGIN,NICE BOOK BUT I THINK IT COULD BE BETTERI WISH MORE EXTEND TO D
3,this book teach about Delphi in 21 days,"this book teach about Delphi in 21 days.I read summery pascal in one chapter then about creat commponet and design form and Multimedia programing,etc,..."
2,Wheres the CD!,"I have found Sams books to be very infomative in any computer language that I'm interested in BUT, there all useless without the CD! Trying to download from their web page seems a little difficult too. Good Luck."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I thought the book was great for showing you how to manage your way through the Delphi IDE, but as far as coding in Object Pascal i think it lacks considerably. I was looking forward to learning the language more than using the IDE. If anyone knows a good beginners book for Delphi 4 with a stronger focus on Object Pascal PLEASE e mail me. subzerokx@aol.com"
2,Not for absolute beginners and structure not optimal.,"I am using this book to teach a brother of mine how to program. I have been unpleasantly surprised at many omisions and some things missing which are just plain common sense. For example the book doesn't highlight, scripts or differentiate in any matter many things such as when telling the user ""change the name property"". It would help if ""name"" was in a different typeset. This also applies to other properties.Chapter 3, Classes, is not intuitive for an absolute beginner and could be left for a much later date in the 21 days plan.If you, or the person you are planning to buy the book' already knows programming and just want to learn Delphi this is ok, however for absolute beginner I find this book to be very poor."
3,The Retreat... a must read,"One wonders exactly how dark Jerrold Mundis' mind must be after reading the retreat. It is the story of several men who for one reason or another are snatched from society and forced to attend a retreat in an isolated monastery. The treatment the men are subjected to on the retreat takes a look at the darker side of religion and devotion - basically the monks who run the retreat believe pain is the only way to salvation. And aside from pain salvation comes at another price - no one is allowed to leave. The book is violent and explicit, but enthralling. Not for those who are easily offended."
4,I lost one when I put on the 1st day,This is beautiful earring. But I lost one when I put on the 1st day.
2,b-o-r-i-n-g,"Jane Fonda's son Troy Garity stars as Albert Burroughs, a poor imitation of Forrest Gump. He is developmentally disabled, and all the more so because of his overbearing mother who goes to excessive lengths to protect him from the real world. When she is killed in a suspicious hit-n-run accident, Albert is easy prey for two characters who try to con his considerable money which he won as an expert ice fisherman. His employer rounds out the cast as a good guy who has Albert's best interests in mind and tries to shield him from the con artists. This film was an ""official selection"" at festivals in Palm Springs, Slamdance, and Seattle, but you should skip it."
2,Uncompelling and lackluster,"This is the kind of film which the director and screenwriter thought would be really quirky and deep, but ends up being a boring, predictable train wreck. Viewers will see the ""revelation"" regarding Albert's parentage coming from a mile away. The acting is atrocious, especially the characters of Albert and Tuey. Skip it and take a nap instead."
2,Had potential,"Milwaukee Minnesota had potential with its Rain Man like qualities. It goes down hill though into a boring mess. Monk is great as the mom. If this is Fargo's little brother, then the brother isnt entertaining at all."
5,Spiritually discerned,"I do not believe everything in this book. However, I do believe in a majority of it. This book is for those who have been called out of the denominational church system (have seen the falseness of it) and have been learning directly from the spirit of God. You will find more truth in this book than a denominational church. Treat this book like a bucket of apples, taste each one to see if it is good or not, allow the spirit to guide you. I have found this book greatly helpful in detailing my own experiences with being in the wilderness, and searching the truth. If you cannot afford the book, read it online for free at the authors website.Father in heaven has not allowed me to see eye to eye with any human concerning scripture, because He wants me to follow Him only. Having said that, I believe that the author has been taught by the spirit. For those searching, this book is a must read..."
1,Very different view of SonShip,"I've had this book for over 10 years and from time to time I have tried to understand what Russell's view of SonShip really means. I'm 65 and have been in the Latter Rain, SonShip and reconciliation movements since 1968. I cannot find a confirmation in the Spiritthat this book is 100% truth! I see about 40% that lines up with the scripture in it's spiritual interpretation. Most of the concepts are Russell's imagination. The book is way to repetitive and sometimes contradicts itself. All in all it will challenge your ideas of God and orthodoxy. Russell's view of our Father is not correct. What happened in the Garden is up for interpretation in many lines of thought. We just have what we need to come into the fullness of Christ. Redundancy is this books true title. It could have been at least 1/2 the contents and needs editing badly! Father has said that ""I will send strong delusion"" that will test you all and this book is a test, read it at your own risk!"
3,"Good Audio, but Video Looks Like A VHS Copy","I guess if I had to choose a better sound or picture, it scores.But it looks as if there was no attempt to improve the video quality.There is a green line on the left side of the screen and tracking marks to the top.At least, I can zoom the picture and remove them, but that's not the point.I shouldn't have to. It should have been already done.Otherwise, it's a decent concert since it is Manilow after all."
5,Barry is the best,Great songs and presented as only Barry Manilow can bring. This is a very good album with a great list of songs that everyone will enjoy.
5,Endearingly Sweet Christmas Movie,"I picked up this movie at my Christian bookstore last week and really enjoy watching this movie. The movie is very clean and family friendly and centers one how our modern world has all too often forgotten that Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. One of the things that makes the film so enjoyable is that, even though it's quite obvious from watching it that it's a Christian film, there are an interesting mix of humor, drama and love interwoven in the film, which makes the movie quite enjoyable to watch. Even if you don't normally watch Christian films, I would highly recommend watching this film. It would be an especially good movie to watch with the family around Christmas as it has a message which is directly tied to the Christmas season being about the birth of Jesus but is displayed in a non-preachy way."
5,Good Movie for Christmas,This movie was about the real meaning of Christmas and the film was well done and could be used from school age children up to adults.
4,Beautiful Movie,What a great way to get into the Christmas spirit. It's also great to watch other times of the year when you need that little extra heavenly boost.
4,Beautiful coat,"This coat is luxurious. It is very soft and charming wool; people often stroke it, amazed it is a wool coat--the angora makes it wonderful. The collar is great when it is cold, though it can be tough on earrings and hair styles--pushing them up and away. There are two flaws, however: it is sized small and the zipper is an unfortunate and not very handy closure. If I had known these flaws, I would not have bought the coat. It needs buttons and to be a bit roomier. Who wears a wool coat without also wearing other winter scale clothing? Not me, so it is hard to wear layers and still be able to zip up the coat."
3,Look to the underground.,"I think that all reviewers have some points here.The book is a bit whiny. There isn't any documented research. But I think to discount what this book is saying would be denial. The facts that conglomerations own the majority of publishing is bound to inhibit the selection of books they produce or seek out. What this book gave to me is that I should seek out smaller publishers, whether at amazon.com or the library and see what they have to offer instead of assuming that the books in the prime POS spots at the bookstore or on the Best Of Lists are the only books worth seeking out."
2,whine,"The premise here is that because of a number of changes in the business of publishing, fewer works of merit are being published today than was the case yesteryear. Hmmm. That could have been an interesting book, had the author taken the trouble to research it. I could really have gotten into a substantive book with a modicum of research tracing the changes the author alludes to and proving his allegations. Instead we get a somewhat haphazard memoir laced with unsubstantiated complaints about his ill-usage by the publishing world. Pity. I thought I was buying a book."
1,A Loser Whines,"Mr. Schiffrin offers his thesis that there is no intellectual competition in publishing. Only right wing books are being sold! The government must intervene! Then, in passing, he admits that 70,000 books a year are published in the U.S. He tells us that in the good old days (before he drove his house into financial difficulty) the Elite (him) with noble New Deal ideals (his words) were able to educate us. Of course, the independent booksellers are also being destroyed by this right wing conspiracy. I'm writing this on Amazon, which offers more intellectual variety, to more people, than any bookseller in history. I can get any book I want in a week. That used to take me months. You be the judge."
1,The book came in Italian...,"Unfortunately, the book arrived in Italian and I anticipated English. The language of the book was nowhere in the description, so basically it became an unreadable book."
3,This book was all over the place,"This book was created in the hopes of a best seller, and the only reason it reached this was because of all the school children that have be required to read this book. Bradbury had a good idea but fell short of a good book. He used too many describing words and wasted them on things, instead of the characters which needed some explaination. This book was written with the hopes of leaving you thinking, but the only thing it left me thinking was "" What kind of ending was that"""
1,Wrong Translation Not English,"Order this for my daughter she is studing this book. so I got it for her Christmas present. Didn't look at real close so when she opened it for Chistmas she started laughing and laughing. She finle told me way....alittle embearsed, so we put it up. know anyone that can read German?"
1,Not satisfied with the seller. :(,"I ordered 1 English copy and ended with 3 German copies instead! At least, they reimbursed me once I returned the 3 titles back."
4,Interesting...,It is very interesting and strange. I never has been read this kind of book before. It have very strong words inside. It makes me think about our future. Hopefully it won't happen in the future.
4,A wild look at fantasy,"This comic is not for the weak of heart. A bit of an adult oriented comic. A girl that is an archeology student find that she has a few special abilities. She soon becomes quenn of an amazon tribe and is tranported to a different world to save it from a growing threat. Great art work and a story line that keeps you reading. Very interesting characters and situations. A great comic in my opinion but the Water wars is a little better. Magic, warriors, chicks, aliens, anthropes, lots of weapons and battle, pluse a not to shabby story line."
3,Has its ups and downs,"Regardless of your opinion of the song ""Don't Worry, Be Happy,"" this album is worth considering for anyone trying to get into Mcferrin's music.I bought this CD for the song ""Drive"", which I heard on Saturday Night Live and is the best live performance I have ever seen. (How many people do you know that can sing two notes at once? And in harmony, no less!) While it sounds great on the CD, it's absolutely nothing compared to the live version. Mcferrin uses multiple dubs on this CD, so I don't think it really shows how talented he is. Much better is an album like ""The Voice,"" which is live and has no dubs.Still, there are some songs on this CD that stand up to multiple listenings, such as the great Beatles cover ""Drive My Car,"" ""Simple Pleasures,"" the aforementioned ""Drive,"" and ""All I Want."" Others are worth listening to once or twice but are rather forgettable."
3,Getting past the verbal gymnastics,"Enough time has past to admit that ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" is a fun song. Despite its omnipresent airplay this clever little song is really catchy and has fun with its basic message. Throughout the CD McFerrin's contributions are the ones to listen for; the covers of such songs as ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""Suzie Q"" are to be admired for McFerrin's incredible ability to create purely verbal renditions of the songs but once the fascination with how he created the songs wears off the listener realizes that McFerrin's interpretation adds nothing to the originals. It's with ""Simple Pleasures"" and ""Drive"" that McFerrin excels; creating interesting compositions that stand on their own."
5,"This C.D. has a 5 star vote,You'll Enjoy it Note for Note!!","I LOVE BOBBBY McFERRIN! The reason...Don't Worry Be Happy! I could listen to it all day every day and not get tired of it. The other tracks are first rate too! So if there ever is a need for a wonderful song, make it Don't Worry Be Happy!"
1,Don't Buy This. Be Happy.,"This is the album on which Bobby McFerrin released the unspeakable song ""Don't Worry, Be Happy."" Without a doubt the worst song of the 1980s."
3,Middling,"This is an average French language learning program. My biggest issue is with the vocabulary lists. It does give vocabulary lists, but no guide or audio as to how to pronounce the words. Also, too much English in the audio directions. It needed more spoken French overall."
5,So Beautiful!!,This is such a well made piece of jewelry. It came looking exactly like the picture and by far is the coolest anklet I have ever owned!
2,Doesn't Last,"Works great for 1 or 2 seasons, then leaks like a sieve. I have replaced two of them. No more. I'm going to avoid Mueller and QuarterMaster from now on."
2,Overpriced Junk,"Lasts 2 seasons and spews water non stop if you leave your hose connected and this valve opened or on. A better explanation is when you stop the water at the hose end and walk away within a minute water is flowing on the ground from the handle area of this valve. My plumbers explanation was ""they are junk"" and obviously not made to last."
4,Good case for the price,If you are a avid CD buyer. Do not get this one. Get another caselogic still though. All of case logic cases have those handy-dandy sleeves which everyone loves. I really like this case for my CDs (although not very many.) Case Logic is a brand name you can trust from water and all that. My friend puked all over his room and his case is still in tip top shape (although I don't touch it anymore). If you want any case that has as much of a warranty as a CD case could have get this one or another caselogic. I strongly recommend them. This one also has a very sleek design! Your CD's will not get scratched from a knock-off CD case ever again!
4,The third and final book in the Birthgrave trilogy...,"finds Tuvek/Vazkor nearing his quest for hismysterious witch/goddess mother. This book has more incommon with ""The Birthgrave"" than its immediatepredecessor, ""Vazkor, Son of Vazkor"". It has moreof the epic feel, with Tuvek discovering, as hismother did, the realm and scope of his powers throughhis travels through strange and mystical kingdoms.This is classic Lee, with all the epic quality of""The Birthgrave"" (though please read that first),and Tuvek/Vazkor's character is much more sympatheticand likable than in ""Vazkor, Son Of Vazkor"" as hegrows gradually less bent on vengeance as the storyprogresses. If you loved ""The Birthgrave"" as I did,this is similar in tone, and worth reading as well."
5,O'Rourke from Leftist Grub to Conservative Blowfly,"This is an excellent anthology of O'Rourke's writings from his commie journalist days in Baltimore in the early 1970s, through his years at NATIONAL LAMPOON, up to the mid-90s when he was writing articles about politics, current events and foreign affairs for ROLLING STONE and the conservative AMERICAN SPECTATOR. Included are articles about cars the he wrote for CAR & DRIVER, articles about fishing and hunting originally published in MEN'S JOURNAL, and a speech he gave at a CATO Institute function.The essays vary greatly not just with regards to topics, but also with respect to the degree of humour, and some border on the serious. But all are interesting, as any P.J. O'Rourke fan would expect.As O'Rourke states in the Introduction: ""It is, I guess, interesting to watch the leftist grub weaving itself into the pupa of satire and then emerging a resplendent conservative blowfly."""
5,Auto repair,Great manual. We have 3 Toyotas and this has been a big help in repairs. Helped us save money too
3,Ok but could be better,"If you havent worked on cars in awhile and decided your gonna get back into the diy your gonna need more then just this manual, in my opinion it could explain things just a little better, and then the refer to this chapter for something on another chapter, it does help some but it could be better, if you use tutorials like what you see on u tube and the book they work good toghether."
1,Failed just past the 30 day return,"This light worked perfectly fine in my Discovery Wonderwall projector for a month. Then a black spot formed in the middle of the picture which grew rapidly to block out nearly half of the picture so that only the edges could be seen. Unfortunately, this happened a week or so after the 30day return mark."
1,Think twice,Arm thing is nothing like photo. Its a flat piece of foam with two elastic straps that loop on your arm. Portion that goes on head is flat. if you look at photo it appears to be real looking side burns. If you want this costume i would suggest you get it from a Halloween store where it will be cheaper and you can actually see what you are getting. Felt ripped off to be honest with you and didn't even wear costume. Lesson learned if you are going to buy a costume look at it in a store first before ordering on-line.
3,Not a Bad Book but....,"I thought this book was quite good, but I also found, as did another reviewer, that there were conflicting messages at times. It was funny in parts, but if you're looking for ""large"" humor that will have you rolling on the floor, try The Big Girls' Guide to Life by Bunkie Lynn. Very funny!!!!!"
3,"Very Funny, could be more size positive","This book is outrageously funny and has great insights on the perils of being fat. Wendy's adventures at Duke, at Weight Watchers (although I?ve never been held up by robbers at a WW meeting), on meds are carbon copies of other dieters. I'm glad she threw off the shackles of dieting obsession. However, Wendy seems to flip-flop a bit on the issue of size acceptance. She sometimes seems to convey the message ""I'm okay with being fat but I hope the magic pill comes along."" Real size acceptance and being size positive means fighting for your right to exist no matter what size you are."
5,Read this book!!!,"Whether you're fat or not, this book is a great read. Wendy is sharp and funny and has a perspective much-missing from the pop culture she (and I) love so much. I laughed out loud several times reading this book and yet also connected to it emotionally having dealt with (and still dealing with) my own issues with my appearance and self-acceptance. This is NOT one of those annoying self-help books! It's the funny, smart tale of Wendy's odyssey through the diet and fake ""health"" industry, with a savvy look at mainstream media at the same time. Read it!!!"
3,Not the Guide I was looking for...,"I was really excited to read this book, that being said...it was a bit disappointing. Our ""guide"" has loads of info on different diets she has tried and the typical injustices of being a plus size gal in modern America. However, I needed the story to be more personal, it felt a little polite, or reserved...I guess I was looking for a book that addresses being fat on an airplane... with humor. Not a ""To diet or Not to diet""..."
3,"On the whole, a good book-","I read this book some months back with a reading group that I was in. I hadn't heard of the book prior to this. On the whole, I'd say I found this book to be a good read, one that I'd recommend. There are some good sections relating to self-esteem, exercise, quirks in the weight loss industry, and other important issues. The main reason I rate this book at only 3 stars is mainly the ranting and railing the author makes towards the concept of losing weight. She does make an excellent point that those of us who are heavy (and yes, I am one of 'them') need to learn how to love and respect ourselves for who we are today, but at the same time seems to dismiss the motivation to lose weight. She spends a lot of time railing against organized weight loss programs- and some of it IS warranted- but fails to realize that what she herself does is essentially the maitenance component of a major nation-wide weight loss program."
1,Silliest Book ever...,I have read many books in my day - and I simply can't say more about this one - then its silly. I really expected more advice and more information - but in the end it will end up being donated and not kept as a reference book. I would think twice before ordering... look for it used if you are curious.
5,Buy multiple copies.....yours will be worn with use..,"I loved this book. As a woman of size in a skinny world, I understand the prejudices, the looks, the comments. I've heard them all. I have two loved ones that have had gastric bypasses to ""fix"" their fat issues. Although it's worked for them, it's not for me. I want to be happy, loved, healthy and satisfied with who I am now. I think it's about time we Biggies stand up for ourselves and tell the world...Love us like we are or it's your loss! This book was like a Bible for fat people everywhere and I've gone through 2 highlighters already. It's been great for my self esteem and feels like a hug from a friend. Well written, touching and feels like she's writing it just for me. Highly recommended to anyone with image issues."
2,Spool knitting,I was not helped by this book. I am sure that the author ment well but I was justconfused by the instructions. I went out and bought a new spool and followed theinstructions that came with it. Even after I knew how to use the spool knitterI was still confused by the instructions with this book
2,Spool Knitting,The preview of the book has pictures in it. The actual book that I received has no illustrations. I felt this was a bit misleading. If you want the pictures be sure that some where in the book description it says that the book is illustrated.
2,Spool knitting,"This book assumes a two-pronged knitter, which I had never heard of before. In addition, it is Extremely Short. Having said that, it does a good job of giving ideas of what can be done with even the smaller, less complex version of these nifty & thrifty little devices, including mentioning the possibility of making what it refers to as a ""flat web."" I had seen accounts of making the knitting tool from a toilet paper roll, but could not imagine how that could have been done successfully. Now I can. I do wish this book had included graphics, though, as those of us who are spacially-challenged have a hard time visualizing which is the ""front"" of a cylindrical object!"
2,Spool Knitting,It's not easy to read. I deleted it as soon as I looked through it. My kindle version came with no pictures and no separation between different methods so everything ran together.
2,Disappointing,Needed more useful info.---disappointing. Good thing it was free or I would be very unhappy.Maybe my expectations were too great.
4,durable and great to travel with,"This case is a fun color, very durable and great to travel with. It is very light weight and holds alot"
2,"Some serious overrating, thus far","Ever read the Chamber of Commerce description of a town only to find upon visiting it that no such place exists. Beware, these guys either have low standards or Governor Whitman has hired them to write this book. I included their advice in two day trips I took with my wife, and was embarassed to have driven out of my way to see sights most peoople would pass by. I advise you use the book to fill in the possible dull moments, but don't base a total trip around their suggestions."
1,out of date & nothing that hasn't been done better by others,"Having read numerous books about NJ, I find this one lacking. It's 10 years old first of all, and there are recent books that cover the ground much better. In particular I liked New jersey Getaways because of it's solid information. Now thats not to say this book doesn't have a lot of information, but the title says ""Day Tripping, Backroads, Eateries, and Funky Adventures"" Half the book at least is about eateries. Half! I think a book about places to eat in jersey is an intersting concept but at least let people know thats the subject matter. This book is NOT about day trips IMHO. If this bookmwas supposed to be about eateries, it might rate 3 stars. A a ""day tripping book"" this is worth 1 star. Much better can be found elsewhere."
2,Not what I expected...,"I checked this book out at the library hoping to find some stuff that my boyfriend and I might be able to go and check out in our local area. This book had hardly anything on our county but other counties got the full write up. Why do that?? Stupid if you ask me. This book is a waste of your time unless you live up north, then this book is for you!!"
1,defective item,"I ordered this item because Good Househeeping rated it the best. lid on the pot was warped. This item weighs 15+lbs and it would be onerous to ship it back. Amazon could not replace the lid and gave me a $10 credit---whoop de do! I spent many hours on the phone trying to get another lid from Rival. When I got it, it wasn't the right lid. After many other minutes on the phone, Rival says they are shipping me a whole new pot---we shall see as it hasn't yet arrived. Today is 1/9/2007 and I 1st ordered this item on 10/2006. Needless to say, I am not happy!!!!"
4,Best of West,"This album is an excellent collection of Mountain tunes from ""back in the day"", and others. I chose it based on some of the reviews already online, and an interview in Guitar Player magazine. The guitar solos are great, but you can't bring back the voices of the past. The live format adds to the excitement. Very nice!"
5,She makes me smile,I bought this doll for me. I find that she seems to speak to me. Now that I have grand-daughters I am able to enjoy dolls again. I had boys and to now have girls in my life I am so blessed..
5,Awesome little guy,"I got this for my boss as a gift, he liked it so much he walked around showing it off to people we work with. Great detail and very durable."
5,Heee hee Buhhhhhh!,"If you like Evan Dorkin's Milk and Cheese, or Hewlett and Martin's Tank Girl, then this is the book for you. Swearing, Chainsaws, Fun with offal... It's all within the pages of Bear:Immortal.Treat yourself to sick laffs and weirdnessaplenty, and prepare to meet the funniest cartoon cat since Tom and Jerry hit the screens. Yes, it really is that good.Buy it. Go on. What are waiting for? Just buy it!"
2,"A glassc0ck, as B3ta would put it","Like everyone else here, I think this begs comparison to the work of Jhonen Vasquez. The humor is NOT the same; it's more domestic and repetitive, a goth version of Tom and Jerry. However, as in Jhonen's work, the dialogue is a thinly veiled attempt to take over your school with memes. A plot made of memes has no depth to it. This is okay if you just want a funny comic, but the nihilistic ""I'm surrounded by idiots"" tone of the book is depressing. This is not a classic. It says nothing new. I don't want a book of sarcastic T-shirt sayings."
2,Noble idea didn't work............,But then again there is no accounting for taste so somebody might like.But IMHO this was the one clunker in the otherwise great Cliford Jordan catalog.Listen.....Chazz
5,looks great,"Bought it for my husband, he gets many compliments. The shoes look great! He says they're pretty comfortable too."
5,Great Feel on the Feet,This is the third pair of Skechers I've owned and they all have been very comfortable. The Tao 4 is no exception. I've had many compliments on this pair of shoes and would not hesitate to buy them again.
2,I don't like it only because Son won't eat it.,"It tastes fine to me, but my son will take 1-3 spoonfuls then spits it out. Green beans and Spinach he can't keep down. Hot or Cold he doesn't like this.I still try now and then hoping he'll change his mind. He's 11 months now since we started him at 5 months and still doesn't like this. He does like steamed green beans I cook, but not this.I've mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because I know its good for him.Good price and value, but not worth it if your child won't eat it."
2,Beware!!!,"You can get one pack (2count) at Kroger for .97 and at walmart for .94 and if you are signed up for coupons you get $1 off 3 or 4 packages. These are price slightly high. If you like convince of not leaving your home, then go for it."
1,This is 2x the price from the prices in Walgreens.,"I was thinking of buying from here but then I thought of checking out the price in Walmart or Walgreens first.Indeed, the price in Walgreens is half of the price here. As of this writing, the Amazon price is $10.69, while the Walgreens price is only $5.00 for a pack of 8."
1,black powder in it,"please be care full with this as i just complained to gerber as i found black powder inside sweetpottato tubs that i got from BJs , just a word of caution as im yet to find out what it is from gerber .upon calling gerber they said it could be charcoal from overburnt product & they are saying "" as far as seal is intact its safe"" hellooo plz dont tell me charcoal or rust or whatever it might be found in a tub sealed can be safe? im now going to be carefull while giving it to my baby .. so please u also be just carefull to see if no black powder is in .. if so discard it ."
5,MUST HAVE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!,"This book (small, but worth its weight in gold)has been an inspiration to me since the 70's, helping me through many difficulties. Words cannot adequately describe this AWESOME book and it's power & value. I am constantly giving it to others in need. It is a MUST READ (I have read it over and over thru the years). You will be blessed beyond measure. PLEASE PLEASE BUY ONE.....you can't go wrong."
1,A waste of money,"Bought this kit to use for my son's 8th birthday party. One of the experiments didn't work, and the candle making was OK but kids started to get bored. The only worthwhile experiment was the vinegar/baking soda one, but the only thing supplied by the kit was balloons. The kit comes with almost none of the supplies that you need for the experiments; I had to buy water bottles, baking soda vinegar, crayons and 4 tin cans, and the kit provided wax and balloons. It's a good thing I had planned a number of other experiments for the party, since the ones provided only took 30-40 minutes rather than the 90 minutes that is claimed on the box."
4,Needs special bulb.,Really cool lamp. Came in styrofoam that went everywhere though. Bad packaging but was safe. After getting it out of the monstrous package it was bulbless. Plus the special bulbs it needs are only made in China (very bad idea there). So they don't sell these Chinese bulbs anywhere other than Home Despot. So I had to give the bastards $3.00 for two bulbs plus it went out of country. Well the lamp looks very cool but I'll have to spend $100 on American products now to offest my guilty conscience.The lamp does look extremely kick-ass among my frog king collection. If you like groovy lamps or collect frog kings like me then this is a very cool addition. It doesn't put out much light but has a more decorative feel with an ambient vibe to the light.I'd probably give this lamp 5 stars but as for the obtuse bulb situation and the outrageous package it came in I had to knock off a star for integrity.
3,How did this happen?,"In the movie, a band signals the arrival of Rocky to an event by playing the main theme from all the movies ""Gonna Fly Now"". Now. How did the band know this song? It is the theme of the movies, not a song that was actually in any of the movies. It would be like one of the runners in Chariots of Fire humming the Vangelis theme during the movie. He couldn't have. He's never heard the theme. So... how did the band know this music they played? How did this happen?"
4,More Punches Than Any Boxing Movie in History,"Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky III"" (1982) goes the distance as a pop-culture time capsule - featuring Mr. T, Hulk Hogan and Survivor's smash hit ""Eye of the Tiger."" The film's slickness becomes its salvation, with an incredibly high punching rate during the climactic bout. Fast-moving escapism and the best Stallone-directed sequel apart from ""Rocky Balboa."""
4,Rocky III (1982),"A fairly decent sequel for the franchise. The movie picks up where the last Rocky movie left off with Rocky Balboa living his life as the heavy weight champion, but gets challenged by a pist off heavy weight contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T). The story is a bit cliched driven and the film doesn't have as much story content as the first two films, but the acting, directing, and the deeper character development give this movie a high praise. The soundtrack to this film is probably one of the best in movie history, so its no wonder why this film is a classic. Overall, I think fans of the Rocky series will enjoy this sequel."
4,Rocky's finest moment!,"Although there is nothing in Rocky III that we haven't really seen in the first two films,Rocky III is the best of the series.Once again Rocky is pondering retirement,but without boxing he can't support his wife and kid.Here Rocky faces Clubber Lang(Mr.T),who keeps making challanges,that pretty much force Rocky back into boxing.This time Rocky's trainer Mickey dies,and Apollo Creed steps up to help Rocky train,so he can be prepared when he has to step up to face Clubber Lang.Naturally we know who is going to win in the end.Also,Eye of Tiger,awesome song for this movie.Rocky III is the most fun of the Rocky films."
4,Sylvester Stallone's Rocky III,"This was the best sequel to Rocky for my opinion. After winning the title from Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers), Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) has defended his title several times. Then, Clubber Lang(Mr. T) challenges Rocky to a match and Rocky accepts. Before the fight, Mickey(Burgess Merideth), Rocky's trainer, has a heart attack and can't watch the fight. Rocky looses the match inside of three rounds. After the fight, Mickey dies in the locker room. Apollo Creed offers to train Rocky to get his title back in a rematch. This was a great sequel and it had great acting. Watch this movie, you won't be disapointed."
4,Rocky III,"Rocky III is one of the best films of the whole saga. It's to me the best only behind ""Rocky IV"", my personal favorite. The suspense starts when heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is suddenly defeated by a boastful contender, the brutish Clubber Lang (Mr. T). During the bloody defeat, his trainer and close friend, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith), passes away. Now clear that he has lost his edge, his only hope is when his old foe and nemesis, ex-champ Apollo Creed, comes to help him get back the ""eye of the tiger"" in Los Angeles. Training in L.A. with Creed and his former trainer, Tony Duke, Rocky attempts to triumph in a comeback rematch at Madison Square Garden in the Big Apple with the cocky Lang. A must-see hit from United Artists and writer, director, and star Sylvester Stallone."
3,I Pity the Fool,"Another Rocky classic. Mr. T is awesome as Clubber Lang. Hulk Hogan being in the picture not a good idea. Rocky loses the title only to regain it with the help of Apollo Creed, who is in his corner after Mickey dies. The friendship that develops between two former heavyweight champions is priceless. I pity the fool who does not like Roccky III."
4,Rocky III (1982)-Three times the charm.,Rocky III (1982) was a four star return event. Not as good as the first two in my book but still an entertaining movie.
1,"Easily the worst of the series--including ""Rocky V.""","The sheer level of stunt casting, preposterous dialogue and the hideousness of Clubber Lang as a character make this my least favorite ""Rocky"" film to watch--and there's really nothing to suggest to me that it's cinematically superior enough to make up for these faults. It's like a bad, early-'80s comic book where in order to make the hero seem larger than life, the villain has to be a ridiculous charicature of a human being. Mr. T is alright in the role--doing his best with what he has to work with--but the moments of forced sentiment set into motion by killing off Mick are done better in the fourth film, and Lang falls short in one of the important categories of being a villain: The best villains are guys you love to hate. With Clubber Lang, I just wanted him off the screen."
1,disappointed,"blu ray disc does not work for Rocky I, II & III. DVD for Rocky IV is defective but blu ray for Rocky IV is good."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Rocky III is mercifully shorter than the slow second installment but not a very good movie: if you've watched the first two you'll probably watch this to continue the series, but if you're smart you'll just watch the first one and ignore the others."
3,Rocky III - Review,"The third chapter in the life of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) finds Rocky's lifestyle of wealth and idleness suddenly shaken when a powerful fighter known as Clubber Lang (Mr. T) challenges Rocky to a bout. After soundly losing, the previously overconfident champ begins training for a rematch -- with the help of former opponent Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Talia Shire and Burgess Meredith reprise their roles from the first two films."
1,Who thought up this boxing strategy?,"Let some monster pound the living hell out of you until he gets tired? Then when he's tired from beating on you, you knock him out? I tried it once it didn't work. I thought I could beat up a guy by continuously banging my face against his fist. I figured when his hand got tired, I could wear out his foot and leg by slamming my stomach against it. Never made it.The first Rocky was a classic a GREAT FLICK that deserved every award it got. He should have left it at that. This was an embarrassment."
3,Not his best,Just purchased so we have the complete Rocky series. Not impressed with Mr. T. Prefer the first Rocky. Also the Russian one although the ending is somewhat goofy.
5,amazing,"it's a rocky movie, what else is there to say. is it great acting? no. is the storyline predictable? yes. but what a fighter and just overall awesome guy. love stallone in this it was just the ultimate American. Man. Movie."
1,Ungood,"Yep, you read that right. Ungood. It's way too much info for a beginner and there's nothing 'conversational' about it. I actually ended up using a free online language lesson which proved to be far superior to this. I don't know if it could be used in other situations but it was useless for a couple people who needed the basics for a two week trip to Istanbul."
3,Not Enough Information,"I wouldn't really be able to get by in Turkey with this...unless all of our conversations were planned out! It doesn't provide you with enough information for this to be called ""conversational"". However, it WAS only $30...I suppose the better course would be the $200, as it would be more complete. Also, I have to question this method...I have studied five years of French, and 7 years of Japanese, and have taken classes where we learn to write verb tenses, etc. How are you supposed to know how to say anything if you don't know how it's spelled? You can't get by in a country by speaking alone...and even with speaking, you can misinterpret things, and then how do you know which word it was? Not really recommended for people who are serious about learning this language."
4,"Great for Speaking, Writing A Revelation","For me this was a very good product: I needed to learn some Turkish for a business trip. I needed to learn it in manageable chunks. The audio-only format allowed me to make progress while commuting.The Pimsleur approach, for me at least, did a good job of developing both ear and accent. While in Turkey I got a couple of compliments about my pronunciation...the way the material treats vowel harmony made it quite easy for me to incorporate this Turkish-specific attribute into my learning.What's the drawback? This is audio-only. After a couple weeks of practice, it was a revelation to page through a Lonely Planet phrase book and see where some of the word breaks are and to see how Turkish is written.The CDs are not a complete solution, but they were an extremely good one for me."
5,It was great!,I think that this program is well worth the money. It is very simple in format and you learn how to speak Turkish without vocabulary or grammar drills. And the language really sticks in your mind! I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Turkish. I only wish there were more lessons than just 30.
4,Pimsleurs Language method,"It's good because it keeps on repeating itself- can be easily used in an MP3 player in the train. The course is built logically, and is easy to follow (assuming you listen to each lesson a few times). However, it is unfortunate that there is no book to accompany the CD-Rom, as I would like sometimes to see what I'm hearing."
5,Great Intro to Turkish!,"Having studied track 10 (of 16), I've studied Turkish for a month, and my Turkish language skills--albeit limited--have already impressed a few native Turkish speakers. I took another reviewer's advice to purchase Pimsleur as my first Turkish language learning tool. Basically, I listen to these tapes whenever possible: in the car, at home on my computer, and outside on my mp3 player. After a week of listening to the tapes (around lesson 3), I could catch single words, such as konusmuyor (""I don't speak/say""), when native-speaking friends were speaking to each other. These CD's were well worth the investment, as I can communicate basic ideas in Turkish, e.g. ""let's eat at the restaurant"" and ""would you like to drink coffee or tea?"". After I finish this series, I will pick up ""Teach Yourself Turkish"" to learn basic reading and writing."
2,"Very sad...but ultimately, silly","As an African-American woman, I found parts of this book absolutely painful to read. I was alternately in tears and furiously angry at Gregory's unflinching portrayal of the horrors of the slave trade and the racist attitudes of those who profited from it. I knew there could be no ""happy ending"" in which the slave trade did not continue, and I was sad to note that some racist attitudes are still prevalent today. As a result, I almost did not finish the book.However, the book quickly segued into a regular old Harlequin romance - improbable at best, and as one previous reviewer noted, with far too many loose ends. I finished it, and learned from it, but I was only entertained by it in the most eye-rolling of ways."
2,I couldn't finish the book...,"I got through half of the book before I became so bored that I read the last chapter to find out what happens to the characters. The whole premise of European brutality towards African slaves becomes mundane repitition and nothing new or insightful is brought to light through the experiences of either Francis or Mehuru. It comes as no surprise that they fall in love nor is it the least bit interesting to read in light that the whole black man/woman smart, insightful slave and uncaring, raping, brutal white slaver stereotype is definitely overplayed."
2,snore...zzzzz...snore,"Ok, I'm a true Gregory fan. I always have been since ""Wideacre"" but I mean...come on!Her other books were exciting and made me want to keep reading! This one...it fell very, very short. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. Yes, reading about how all the slaves were treated was heart-wrenching, but I get it. I would like to have some sort of plot to go along with that.When I did get a plot, it was a slow moving and dull one. I knew what was going to happen before it did and that just made it even more boring. Gregory used to have such flare! What happened here?"
3,An eye opener into a despicable business,This book does a good job of introducing one to the despicable business that was slave trade and to Eighteenth century England . The characters are also well developed.The book is well written and read quickly except for the last part. It seemed as if the author was belaboring about the fact that Josiah was to be doomed in his new ventures and that Mehuru and Frances were falling in love.One can safely skim over many such pages towards the end of the book and not lose touch with the story.
1,Not a favorite,"I am a very big fan of Gregory's, but cannot recommend this book. I found it uninteresting and hugely predictable. I honestly had to force myself to finish it. If you're looking for entertainment, don't stop here."
2,Disappointing Characters,"One of my favorite things about Gregory's books are the personalities of the characters. For me, I could not make an emotional connection with anyone in this book. I could feel sorrow for characters and definitely for the slavery subject matter. I just feel that there was no life in the characters themselves. This book was by far the worst Philippa Gregory book that I have ever read. I never thought that it was possible to say that about one of her books!"
3,"Good, but not the best","I have read most books by Philippa Gregory and like most, this one was quite well written. I cried a few times throughout this book (that is very uncommon for me) and I did like the overall story. The one downer for me, was Frances. She was so annoying! When I read books, I enjoy seeing things from the perspective of others, and learning about different people. Ms. Gregory has always been brilliant at creating very abstract characters. But I just dont understand Frances, she says that she is completely in love with Mohoru, and that this is the first time she has ever been truly happy... but she has quite conditional love.... She just really bothered me.Besides her, this book was marvelous, and I do recommend it."
4,Very enjoyable--different from her other work,This was an insightful novel that paints a picture of slavery I never knew...predating Anerica's struggles. Very well written and paced.
2,A waste of time...,"I really enjoyed 'The Other Boleyn Sister' and was anxious to read more from the author. This book was a waste of time! I was more than half-way through the book when I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and that most of the book wasn't even logical. For instance, the lead slave seemed to learn to speak English AND write in two chapters, the love affair between the lead slave and Frances was not even a little bit believable, not to mention the 'secret'pregnancy. I can't believe this is the same author. I will try to read other books from Ms. Gregory, but I would not recommend this one to anyone."
1,Disappointing,"Having read The Other Boylen Girl, Queens Fool and the Virgin's Lover, and enjoyed them greatly, I was expecting more of the same. It was not to be. I thought the story was totally unbelivable and the style of writing much more simplistic. In fact, I got half way through it, and gave up in disgust."
4,"An honest, unflinching historical novel","This book was very well written, but also very stark and unflinching in its portrayal of the slave trade in the city of Bristol at the end of the eighteenth century. It was not a nice time, and the city was neither genteel nor polite, no matter how much it pretended to be. The book captured this roughness, as well as the political maneuverings of the very rich, who managed to use everyone who was not included in their select circle for their own personal gain.Enter into this scene one impoverished lady with only her good name, an ambitious merchant and his sister, and a highly educated slave, and you get a story filled with complicated loyalties and difficult questions. What impressed me about this book is that it offered no trite answers to these questions."
4,A Respectable Trade,I haven't started the book yet. I chose it because of the person who wrote the book. I have enjoyed several of her books. I was drawned to the book because of the title too. I believe i chose a good book.
4,a good read and worth the money,"Having read many of Philippa Gregory's books and loved them, I decided to ignore the bad reviews I read about this one and buy it anyway...and I'm glad I did. I found the story both compelling and heartbreaking, and not at all unbelievable. I did not like it as much as some of her other novels, but I liked it nonetheless. If you are a Gregory fan don't listen to the naysayers...this was a good read overall and I was not disappointed."
2,Troubling,"As a black woman, I too found this difficult to read. On a practical level I felt that Ms. Gregory pushed too hard to make this story plausible. I found no link for this romance, no real spark. I found the 'love at first sight' a bit of rubbish for this day and time. Mehuru seemed to good, a little too ""Kunta Kente-ish"". And Frances was vapid and skittish, hardly the type of love match one is used to. I loved all her other books, but I had to make myself finish this."
4,UFO HAD NO PLACE TO RUN AFTER SCHENKER.,"UFO COULD'VE MADE ANY ALBUM AND IT WOULD'VE HAD IT'S CRITICSAFTER SCHENKER LEFT. BUT THIS IS A GEM. NO PLACE TO RUN IS MYFAVORITE UFO SONG! AWESOME SONG. ALSO LETTIN' GO, ANYDAY &TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT ARE BRILLIANT. NICE FOLLOW UP TO THE LIVEALBUM. PAUL CHAPMAN WAS A GOOD CHOICES ANDWERE GREAT LIVE ON THIS TOUR. I SAW THEM 5 TIMES. GET THE DVDIF YOU CAN FIND IT. NOT AS GOOD AS WILD WILLING INNOCENT BUTHIGHLY RECOMMENDED. KEEP ROCKIN' UFO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Why so expensive?,"How do they expect anyone to buy some of these UFO albums when they are so god damd expensive? C'mon, who the hell is going to pay 60 bucks for one CD with maybe about 35 minutes of music on it? Only goes to show you how greed will keep people away from discoving some of this band's good works, like this. Someone lower this down to 10 bucks, then i will buy. $60 for one CD is the biggest ripp off i'v ever seen in my life. No wonder people are downloading music these days."
2,UFO without Schenker?,"As the title implies UFO without Schenker has no place to run. As a matter of fact, UFO's dual engine (Mogg/Schenker) had have ongoing conflict in everything and finally Schenker left the band to form his own. Result? UFO produced this mediocre album and Schenker produced MSG, one of the best Rock/Metal album in '80s."
3,UFO Finding their way Post-Schenker............,"I bought this album with trepidation because of the landmark personnel change which had befallen UFO the year before.I was wondering how ANYONE could replace Michael, the architect of so many of my musical memories. And, while a good album, I can't rate it in my UFO top five, even though there are 4 or 5 very good to great songs. Lettin' Go is one such great song, as is the title cut with its canny springsteen references.Produced by the legendary George Martin, it just doesn't jump out and bludgeon you like the Nevison efforts do.So, I was slightly concerned that UFO had peaked. My fears were put to rest when, in 1981, UFO released the awe-inspiring The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent. Chapman sounds much more comfortable on that album, and it's the guitar tour-de-force we were waiting for from him. No Place to Run is still worth buying, because a middling UFO album is still light years ahead of the competition."
5,Highly recommended!,"When I was pregnant with my first child, it seemed everyone was asking me ""You ARE going to have a natural delivery, right?"". I felt guilty saying I would consider an epidural if I felt I couldn't handle the pain and was also very afraid of the needle that would be used. I survived the first 12 hours of labor without the epidural, but was suffering and also getting nowhere. I felt guilty and scared about my decision to get an epidural until Dr. Grant himself came in and gave it to me (the process was painless and I was able to ""enjoy"" labor afterwards). Dr. Grant also gave me a copy of this book, which I have now read and wish I had read before my baby was born. I will never again feel guilty about my decision not to suffer the entire 24 hours of labor and will definitely be getting an epidural if I'm lucky enough to have more children after this. I recommend this book to every pregnant woman!"
3,package design not so hot...,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who shaves with and collects straight razors. I was disappointed when I opened the box to find that the soap comes in a clear plastic, clam shell, type container. It's the kind of thing a serving of pudding should come in. I felt like I'd put a quarter in a gumball machine only I'd spent a lot more than just a quarter.If I was buying this for myself I wouldn't have minded BUT it would have been nice to know before I bought the product."
2,Not sure why everybody love it,"To put it simple, id rather use gillete's foamy over this, many people here love it, not my case. overrated"
3,So So Not the real good strong Bay Rum you got as a kid.,Only so so. I think I will get only the cremes from now on. I guess it is ok but not fer medray
1,Almost gave up on my double edge shaving,"I just got into shaving with a double edge razor. I've been using an electric shaver for years and it got old. I bought everything I needed to start shaving with a safety razor. At first I thought it was my cheap brush drying my face out to a tight leather feel. I invested in a better brush but no luck still terrible razor burn. I bought new blades, still no luck. I tried different techniques for shaving and still got the terrible dry irritated skin with razor burn. As a last ditch effort before giving up I stole my dads shaving soap he buys from a different vendor. Worked awesome, great shave, and minimal irritation. With practice I'm sure the irritation will go away completely. By trying a new soap I had a great shave and no dryness. I'd suggest steering clear of this product. I bought three and will be tossing them in the trash if they don't work for hand soap."
1,Ouch,If you want a good shave buy a can of shaving gel! I don't care how long you leav this stuff on you will not get a good shave. Also it dosent come with a brush or cup so make sheer your prepared.
4,A good standard,"When it comes to shaving soaps, Col Conk is a good stand-by. I use it often to measure other soaps. It isn't the best I've used, but it's effective and smells nice. The bay rum scent is not as strong as I like, but it's not non-existent. There's a fair amount of glycerin to keep the lather from needing much maintenance during a shave with multiple passed, and the lather forms fairly quickly with a good badger brush."
4,It's decent soap but I still prefer the Williams,"Lathers up nicely, has a very pleasant mild smell and washes off nicely. But for the money and convenience I'll stick to the locally bought Williams for $1.35 at CVS."
1,Colonel Conk shaving soap,The soap did not lather up very well and my skin felt dryed out after using this soap. I went back to using my other canned shaving cream and got excellent results
5,First Rate,"The shaving soap was great, I love the smell of the bay rum. It foams great, smells super and I am most pleased with my purchase."
3,Try it at least once,"It lathers pretty decently just rubbing it against my beard but I'd really recommend using a shaving brush with this. Now that I've used actual shaving soap, as well as hand soap, the main reason I'd buy this again over any old soap is that it doesn't smell like flowers.Bay Rum actually a really good smell; I'm gonna need to do some shopping to find a scent that works well with my cologne."
3,"Decent scent, lather and protection. Doesn't rinse","I up picked the travel version of this because I recently started shaving with a double-edge razor, and wanted to continue using mug soap and a brush. Col. Conk's travel soap seemed like the way to go. The actual shave experience is all pretty good - the bay rum scent was pleasing, it lubricated the blade well enough, and I had no problems achieving a decent lather. My first shave with this soap was in New York. I noticed that it didn't want to rinse cleanly, and suspected that maybe it was the local water. So, I tried it at home, and had the same result (I'm used to Detroit water, and the water here is pretty soft.) I don't think I'd ever buy this for home use, and I might purchase a different brand for travel (not because it's bad... it's just not great.) Over all, I think I like Van Der Hagen's Luxury shave soap more. About the same price, same experience, but it rinses off way easier."
4,Much better than regular soap,"I've been using an Omega Stripey badger brush for about a year. Until last week I was shaving with ordinary liquid soap which was fine. I only bought the Col. Conk's because I needed something cheap to get me over the free shipping minimum. As it turns out I didn't know what I was missing. The Col. Conk's produces a much thicker lather than ordinary soap and the shave is much more comfortable. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is the price, $5 seems like a lot for a small bar of soap. If they were to sell a 5 pack for $10 then I'd happily rate this at 5 stars."
3,"Good Texture, Not Much Fragrance","This shaving soap has the texture of the Col. Conk's Lime soap with all the smell of hypoallergenic acne soap. 4 bars of soap cost nearly as much as the charge for routine shipping. A different brand has Bay Rum shaving soap that ""smells like Christmas"". The old time Bay Rum sops had a citrus/spice smell. This one smells like nothing."
4,Nice Soap,"Great soap for shaving, combined with the shave soap bowl with lid and razor, it was a great present. Recipient was very pleased"
3,"Liked the smell, but not the shave","I like the name, I kinda like the smell, I didn't like the shave, tho. It didn't seem to glide likeTaylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-OunceorProraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil & Menthol (5.2 oz.). Seemed like I had to use a lot more, too, and it just doesn't seem like the close shave that I am used to with a DE Safety Razor.UPDATE:I ran out of Proraso and had to use the Conk. I found that if you use enough water on your brush, it ain't so bad."
5,Barbrasol? No thanks!,"I am very new to the world of straight razors. My first shaving soap that I ever purchased was Kroeger brand... Wouldn't hold a lather, was very bland in smell, just not pleased. This soap smells great (Obviously not for long. It's shave soap people, not aftershave or Axe body wash). It's lather is nice and thick, always comes out perfect. It's made with glycerin and aloe which I think has actually helped to even out my complexion. I will buy this product again and again, maybe I'll try some different scents of the same brand."
3,I really wanted to like this,"I have been using shaving cakes (soaps) for a while. I wanted to try this one because of the Bay Rum smell. I really, really wanted to like this. But try as I may, I just couldn't get it to come our right. It was either too ""soupey"" and ran off my face or was too dry and dried on the brush and my face. I'll be the first to say perhaps I wasn't using it correctly. But I tried several times and never got good results. Perhaps others will be able to make it work - I just couldn't. You might want to give it a try. It does smell nice!"
4,"Good, but there's probably better out there!",This product does the job but I was expecting a bit more suds and a stronger aroma. But this is just what I was expecting. I don't have anything to compare it with as of yet. I will probably shop around next time to see if I like other brands better. Maybe I will seek the recommendation of others first.
3,"Price, value, quality","Not the most luxurious soap in my arsenal, but works well in hard water and rinses clean from razors.I will always have a puck of this on hand."
2,Col Conk soap bay rum,"For me this bay rum shave puck was very, very dry. I hydrated with water very well. Soaked the razor in hot water and always run the razor under water when it gets full with cream. I put the soap on and by the time I got the razor on my skin, the razor did not glide like it should. It a very tacky, dry feeling like putting the razor on my bare skin with no soap or water. I won't purchase this again. I also didn't notice much of the bay rum smell when shaving. I did finish up with Clubman Bay Rum aftershave though for the full bay rum experience! Giving 2 stars for this product. If no other product was available - that's the only time I'd buy this again. For all the good stuff I read about this soap prior to ordering -- I was really dissappointed."
3,Okay for Shaves,"After trying the brush method of lathering, I find that using a bar of Dove that I keep on the shower caddy is as effective as the round disk of Conk. Since I shave while showering, handling a ceramic cup with soap is not as friendly as just lathering up with a bar of soap. The Conk is a bit too soft for just leaving on the caddy, but it had a good aroma."
3,Its Ok,"I would not call this a bad product, and the scent I felt was very pleasant. However I thought It needed a little more moisturizer. It is an Ok product but I found better and moved on."
3,Smells Wonderful!!,PROS:1. SMELLS WONDERFUL!!!!CONS1. thin foam = bad shave (maybe im doing something wrong?)i prefer the proraso shaving cream.3/5
3,Try Cream instead,"I would opt for a cream, esp if you're new to the wet shaving. Lather is more difficult to develop. I am back to shaving cream after using this a week."
4,Nice price nice smell!,"I started wet shaving with The Art of Shaving starter kit, and recently got a full sized kit (both were lemon).I wanted to try some other soaps, and ""Bay rum"" sounded great! I'll say, I was expecting a more rummy smell and less bay leaf, but the smell has grown on me and I wouldn't have it any other way.Unlike the art of shaving (casswell massey and many others are the same) this is a glycerin soap. So it's a bit softer, sticky, and seems to make a thicker lather, and takes less work to get to a lather. (Although still not as easy/thick as a cream but i like the soaps).Also you can more easily smell it while shaving creating a much more enjoyable experience. The only knock is it seems like this will wear down quicker then the soap from the art of shaving... then again it is about half the price.Great stuff, I'll buy another when mine runs out!"
2,Not that impressed,"I rated this product two stars for a couple reasons. Scent would be a solid 4 stars as I like the scent of the soap puck but once lathered the scent changes to something less than impressive. Shave quality is where this product fails. First, it is VERY hard to get a good lather from this soap. Takes a while to load your brush and then you have to be very careful about how much water you use. Too much and the lather is runny, too little and it dries on your face. When you finally get the water in the lather just right, the lather is very slick but still very thin and does not provide a good cushion.That said, this is a cheap enough product to test whether you like a bay rum scent or to help introduce someone to wet shaving. Be sure that they do not have hard water or this product will be completely useless unless they shave with distilled water."
5,Great shave soap,"I just used this shave soap,and i really like it,i finished up my VDH soap and both are good,but one has to be better so i recommend trying this soap.i got less nicks from this soap and didnt use much my alum block,so that should be a good sign.anyways if your looking at this shave soap its for reason right? so as my last review just get it."
4,First Shaving Soap,"My first soap so I have nothing to compare too. Smells great , had some trouble making lather at first. Super dry brush , load , then add water as needed has worked better for me. Got some VDH soap today going to compare the two."
5,Great shave at a great price!,"This stuff works very well, I actually prefer it to some soaps that cost six times the price. Great volumes of slippery lather, and a nice subtle scent. I'm not ordinarily a fan of bay rum, as it's generally too strong and sickly sweet, but at this low concentration it's very nice and has really grown on me. The scent does not linger, so it won't interfere with your aftershave or cologne.You can certainly use it right out of the simple package, although it may not be something you want to leave out on the counter. I pop the puck into an small, inexpensive bowl (from the local Chinese market!)and heat it in the microwave for about 15 seconds. It quickly melts into the form of the bowl, and cools right back down in a few minutes."
3,Col. Conk's bay rum shaving soap,"I purchased this soap along with a shaving mug, and find it hard to get a consistant lather, however the bay rum scent rocks!"
3,Soap for shaving,"This shaving soap serves it's purpose nicely and has a very mild bay rum scent, but I don't know if I'll be a repeat customer. It's not bad... I think I just prefer the convenience of a shaving cream in a squeeze tube, like King of Shaves Alpha Gel or Trader Joe's Honey Mango Shave Cream."
4,"Good Soap, Very Slick","Colonel Conk's Shave Soap is a good quality product, I wouldn't say great, though I've already bought another puck.Good Lubrication, and good lather very quick, it only takes me 40 seconds to whip up a nice lather. Smell is weak, Nice smell, but a little weak. Not a Cologne Soap for sure, but pleasing scent is there. I'd recommend it to my friends. (if they'd take up Wet-Shaving)"
4,A fine shave - a great scent!,"Ordered the Col.'s over a month ago, melted it into my favorite mug (via microwave) and have thoroughly enjoyed using it. It lathers well with a silvertip brush (plug for Omni), it stays moist on my face, it smells great and at the rate I'm going I should probably get about 3 months out of it. Thought that the price was a little steep compared to my old standard ""Williams"" (One Dollar at the local drugstore) but then Williams doesn't smell like Bay Rum now does it! Definately recommend!"
5,Shaving cream.. gone.,"I'm on my 5th or 6th shave with a DE razor, and this soap type. I have used canned stuff my whole life until recently. I have a really nice badger hair brush, and this soap. I shave with the grain, then against/sideways on the grain for my 2nd pass. I can't bare to shave ""UP"". This soap is GREAT! I have nothing to compare it with, but, it really feels good and smells good too. I am using the bay rum, but, I bought some almond also, they both smell great. The smell lasts for a good bit, but, I've been using some shave balm afterward that overpowers it. I will never go back to canned shaving cream. Shaving is actually comfortable now. Next... straight razor...hmmm.."
5,speed razor,"In this day and age when cake shaving soap cannot be found on the grocer's shelves, Col. Conk is a Godsend. Good product, good service."
5,One of a kind Voice-Great CD,"Up until I bought this CD, the only two songs that I had ever heard by Timi Yuro were ""Hurt"" and ""What's the Matter Baby"". After listening to this CD I will probably buy another one of her's with different songs. She sings her songs from the heart and puts that extra feeling into them thru her voice. Some of the songs on this CD I had never heard anybody sing before and think they must have been specially written and composed for her."
3,A Gift for my Mother,"This album was not personally for me so hence the 3 stars and title, But I did listen to a few or more tracks and the best song and the one she is known for is ""Hurt"", i'm not much on easy listening, but the track ""Hurt"" is a good soulful song. I give it 3 stars for the price and it was a perfect gift for my mother."
5,The Best Torch Song Singer,"Timi Yuro was the best torch song singer of her era. Her music will live on forever. When she sings ""Hurt"" her voice tuggs at your heart strings...."
2,"Good premise, poor execution","I think this was a good premise that ultimately failed in the execution. I didn't mind the focus on Christian philosophy (its from a religious publisher) but I do object to the frequently dismissive and insulting tone the author took toward those who disagree with his philosophy. In addition to the off-putting lack of open-mindedness I feel the author bit off way more than he could chew. He attempted to cover 50 philosophical questions in 225 pages. Basically this left him enough time to briefly explain the question, provide one quote each from Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, then move on. I would have preferred a much deeper exploration of perhaps five or ten questions rather than the shotgun approach the author took."
3,Best for Christians and C.S. Lewis Fans,"This book, while interesting, may be frustrating for non-Christians. As is previously mentioned in another review, the book leans heavily upon C.S. Lewis, a devout Christian, to delve into Tolkien, a devout Catholic. Kreeft continually injects his Christian beliefs as if they were fact, which is fine for the believers of the same but frustrating for those of us who enjoy Tolkien without the preaching. I think Tolkien didn't include an overtly Catholic message in his writing because there was no need to -- the religious undertones are clear enough and inclusive for all readers. If you don't want to read about what Tolkien purposely left out, skip this book and read ""Perilous Realms: Celtic And Norse in Tolkien's Middle-Earth"" by Marjorie Burns."
1,An insulting book reflecting a narrow Christian bias.,"I have greatly enjoyed Tolkien's LOTR since reading it and rereading it in the 1970's.I had hoped that this book would, as advertised, enlighten me concerning philosophy using Tolkien fiction as a background. I am completely disappointed.Next time I will read all the reviews before buying the book."
2,Philosophy of Kreeft,"You won't learn much about the philosophy of Tolkien in this book but you will learn a lot about the philosophy of Peter Kreeft, and what a narrow philosophy it is. Most annoying is Kreeft's insistance in stating his opinions as if they are hard wired facts. No argument possible. Why? Because he says so. From a simplistic (and wrong) statement about Buddhism to a laughable restatement of the scientific method this book is little more than a long ego statement. Look elsewhere for real insight on Tolkien's philosophy."
4,An entertaining intro to philosophy,"Kreeft, in his typical succint and witty style, shows us the not-so-obvious philosophical underpinnings of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. While Kreeft's insights seem a bit contrived at times, perhaps due to the subtlety of Tolkien, he offers us ample quotations from Tolkien as well as his close friend, CS Lewis, to bolster his claims. The philosophical themes that are covered seem grounded in the classical realist tradition which makes sense given both Tolkien's and Kreeft's education, and commitment to the Catholic Church. As such, Kreeft seems to place his main focus on the traditional concept Virtue and contrasts it with the modern sense of the term which is less distinguishable from vice.I highly recommend this book as an introduction to ancient/medieval philosophy, or if you just want some insight as to why you are so drawn to Middle Earth."
1,Communicating for Productivity,"As a professional communicator I found this book particularly relevant in its description of the relationship between communications and management, and the often misunderstood role of the communications within the organizational hierarchy. I laughed as I read the various scenarios painted by the author, because they articulated so well what I see every day in my own work. Its only downfall is spending too much time in theoretical examples to convey the various points, it seems like double-coverage. However, I strongly recommend the book-especially to others in the Communications field-not for its accuracy in capturing this role and relationship, but for its suggestions for graduating beyond those confines into a healthier management-organization communication model and practice."
1,Very Poor Quality,"This product arrived broken. The minute hand was broken off. The clock felt and looked very cheap. It took me two months to get a refund from the seller, MaxiAids."
4,Sears Craftsman AYP EHP Part 179101 Grille Lens,This part came much sooner than advised and fit my mower perfectly. It took care of the mower hood problem and now works as good as new.
1,Dungeons Review,This is set best for oriental game settings and will have little situation on other realms in the Forgotten realms setting. With limited information in the basic pack of how adventurers would gain access and limited maps of Kara'Tur it is significantly hard to cordinate adventures and make new ones.
1,Write About What You Know,"A real disappointment -- I enjoy Joanna Trollope's books for their contemporary British setting but she should stick to writing about England, not attempt to explore the gracious southern lifestyle in the US which is admittedly foreign even to us Yankees in the north. Note to author: a modern southern woman would probably not say ""I shan't..."" In the US, those little rubber things on the ends of baby bottles are called ""nipples"" not ""teats."" A woman suffers from post-partum depression,not ""post-natal depression."" Aside from the cross-cultural gaffes, this book bounced all over from character to (barely tangential) character like silly putty. A sad attempt."
2,Disappointing Trollope,"I have loved all of Joanna Trollope's previous books, but this one was disappointing. She was trying to change writing styles in each section of the book; ""southern"" when in Charleston, SC, and then back to ""British"" when in London. She should stick to what she does so well, that is, writing good, thoughful women's novels based in her own UK. She did not ring true in the American parts of the book, and sounded almost chiche'd at times. Her other books are so much better than this latest."
2,TELL GRANDMA'S STORY,"While the book was well-written, I found myself interested in the stories that were largely untold. Henry was a jerk and Gillon too self-absorbed and shallow. What about Ashley's story? What about Grandma Sarah's story? There was much more to tell that we were given a glimpse of before Trollope jutted off into the main plot line (that I wasn't much interested in, anyway).I enjoyed her style of writing. The dialogue was great. Just felt it could have been a better book. I am definitely going to try some of Trollope's other books before ""writing"" her off!"
2,Characters lacked depth,"The premise and setting of this book had so much potential that the characters did not live up to. Once the storyline moved back to the U.S., the story died. There was dialogue between characters that was hard to follow because it assumed we knew so much more about the characters' psyche than we actually did. I felt like NOTHING happened in the latter half of the book."
3,Not sure if I liked it or not,"This is the first 3-star review I've ever given. Usually I either really like a book or really dislike it, but I'm still not sure (a week after finishing it) how I feel about Girl From the South. I liked the first half, the intro to Henry, Tilly and William in England and Gillon's time there. But once the story shifts to jumping back and forth between Charleston and London it lost its charm. The author gave me no reason why Henry fell out of love with Tilly. No reason why Gillon and Henry like each other. No reason for Tilly to use William. Bottom line, the relationships don't make sense. Odd story, and I doubt I'll read more of hers."
1,A hodgepodge,"Too many characters, too little cohesiveness. I wish Trollope had focused on only three or four of the characters and developed their story in a way that made sense. Among the things that make no sense: why does Henry take a room at a bed and breakfast for $50 a night when he tells Gillon's brother that he can't afford to pay $120 a month towards a mortgage? I also agree with the reader who faulted Trollope on her tenuous grasp of American (let alone Southern) dialect. What American would say ""Has Mama been?"" (for ""Has Mama stopped by?""), ""don't let's"" (for ""let's not""), or ""gone 3"" (for ""past 3"")? Trollope's other books are far superior; read any one of them rather then this one."
1,A very silly book,"As a longtime reader of Joanna Trollope's chick-fiction, I was initially surprised to find that this one had flown into the US under my radar screen. But all became clear as I labored through the hand-wringing (excessive, even for one of Ms Trollope's works) and the too-prominently displayed paragons of her feminine ideal. Honestly, if you've followed --hard to avoid if you read any UK lifestyle magazines -- any of the details of the writer's personal life and her pronouncements on it in recent years, simply transpose the most contrived events or statements to the American South, and you've got it.The book suffers miserably from the absence of a good fact checker. Throughout, the character cast as a psychiatrist is plainly meant to be a psychologist, i.e. not a medical doctor. The author's attempt to ""write American"" was a failed experiment not meant to be repeated."
2,"Whine, whine, whine . . .","If you like a lot of whiny, introspective characters, then this book is for you; there's not a happy one in the bunch. Ms. Trollope is a skilled writer, no fault there, but nothing could compensate for this depressing storyline. I was almost to the end when I realized I had better things to do with my time; I put it down and didn't finish it. I so disliked these characters, I just didn't care what happened to them."
2,Tepid,"I've been a Joanna Trollope fan for years but this book simply doesn't work. Nearly every character, and certainly all the main ones, are so hesitant, so held-in-check by their fears, that I just got impatient with them. I see NO spark of love between Gillon and Henry, we're never let into their attraction for each other, so I'm never terribly concerned with what happens to them. Seriously, Henry seems much more in love with Charleston than with Gillon.I found it reassuring to see that so many other readers had the same reaction. Ms. Trollope's writing is usually so good that I thought I'd missed something, but I think there's just not really a lot of something there. She seems to have written the book while wrapped in cotton wool.I hope for better next time. I know she is very capable of better. ""Marrying the Mistress"" just about drove me crazy at times, but it was real and alive in a way that ""Girl From the South"" is not."
2,disappointing,"For a story set in 2001, the Charlestonians seemed to be 50 ish caricatures. The novel starts off well, but falls apart at the end when there is no actual resolution for any of the characters. There is so much more to Charleston than the Battery, and the names ""Ashley"", ""Cooper"" (rivers) and ""Boone"" (plantation) were very corny choices for one family. Was Martha a psychiatrist or a psychologist? She's described as both, but must have completed her formal training in mere months to be the mother of a 30 something. She is oddly indifferent to her daughter's post-partum depression. No american says ""straight away"". To be such a boor in London, Henry effortlessly charms the socks off all the southerners."
2,A disappointment,"This novel has none of the depth of previous Trollope novels. This story is more suited to the ""Caroline Harvey"" romance line. The characters are shallow, the writing stilted, and the plot thin. There are many breaks in the storyline and they never seem to be tied together. This is the first Trollope book that I have been able to put down. In fact, it may stay down without the last third ever being finished."
4,"Good value, but far from ""complete""","Any fan of Hank Williams' music has learned to view CDs called ""Complete"" with caution. This three-disc set is no exception. Each disc has 20 songs: Greatest Hits, live recordings and solo demos. The greatest hits are well chosen, but leave out essentials like ""Ramblin' Man"" and the wonderfully morose ""Please Make Up Your Mind."" The live cuts, again, are well chosen, but are without any continuity or much explanation. The last disc, solo demos (some later overdubbed with other musicians), is again a good mix of selections, but is far, far from ""complete."" One booklet has a brief biography of Ol' Hank, while the other two booklets list just the songs and basic credits. All of the above aside, ""The Complete Collection"" is a very good value (I paid less than $10.00) as an inexpensive introduction to the many facets of the incredibly prolific original King of Country Music."
4,Not the master tapes,"Hello, It been 60 yrs since some of this music came out. I wish it was remastered."
5,OH-58D Kiowa by Blue Box Toys,Excellent detail and accuracy for a model/toy. A frient of mine flew this specific tail number aircraft in 1991. True to scale. Only two non accurate items. 1. No hellfire missiles are included and 2. the main rotor rotates the wrong way. other than that an excellent scale representation.
4,A Fair Machine that's nice for the price,"I just bought this recorder and it is fairly decent in quality, especially since it is about $10 cheaper then the other micro cassete recorders from here. I have not used any other microcassete recorders before, but I am sure that there are probably more worthy recorders if you are willing to pay the price for them. If you plan to use the recorder frequently spending some more money may be better. However, this recorder does the job well for me, a low frequent user. You basically get a decent machine for a decent amount of money. And if anyone was wondering, it looks like the Panasonic recorder if you wanted to know what it looks like. It also includes one 30 minute tape but does not include batteries (2 AA)"
2,asus a8n,Had this motherboard for about 6 months with no problem. Then the ethernet port went out. I know its easy to just buy an ethernet card but its annoying after 6 months to have to.
1,wrong!!!,"this game is a rather fun game!! i loved the version for gameboy advanced, i played that one for hours. i saw this and i was like, ""hey! the hobbit for xbox!! this is awesome!! gotta be way better!!"", i ordered it and everything, make sure i chose the xbox one..... what did i get? the hobbit for PC.... how dissapointing...."
4,"WEALTH, FAME, LOVE AND DECEIT IN RETAILING","This is the third book I've read written by Stephen Birmingham and not the last. Carriage Trade can be called a soap-opera type book, but from start to finish, Birmingham keeps the surprises coming. After retailing tycoon Si Tarkington is found floating in his pool, his family and business partners (and lovers) unravel his mysterious life...one of past convictions, affairs and trust in the wrong people. His beautiful wife, Consuelo, is not just ""icing on the cake"", but perhaps the strongest character in this book. Their daughter, Miranda, is undecided about her abilities to take over her father's high trend department store and uncovers material throughout the novel to turn the tables. A behind the scenes look at the world of retailing will leave you wondering just what really goes on in your favorite department store??"
5,Fantastic! A must for Classical Music Lovers.,"After watching the movie Amadeus my interest in classical music was born and I desperately needed a guide. Roy Hemmings book filled the ""guide"" requirement splendidly as I had no idea where to begin. I have discovered so much with Roy's help and my interest in this musical genre has never waned since. Thankyou Roy for expanding my repertoire!"
1,Not balanced,"This book was a real disappointment. Mr. Hemming is almost exclusively interested in orchestral music, and addresses chamber music only when he has little choice -- with Chopin, for example. Beethoven's sonatas don't merit anyone's attention? Give me a break. There are more balanced, inclusive guides to be had."
1,Its not a slip cover!,"Its a throw. like a blanket. I would have been better off with a pretty curtain to think of it. It would be better than what I wasted my money on. Also don't wash this with anything else,Even like colors, as the Dye leaks badly.+++++++++++++++ update +++++++++++++++++++++++A year after buying this, Amazon finally corrected this to say throw instead of slipcover. Late much?"
3,it's ok,"It's more like putting a bed sheet on your sofa (granted the material of this is MUCH thicker). I tucked it in as tight as I could, but it became un-tuck very easily. A very nice quality material, but does not serve it purpose too well :("
4,Good Looking and Inexpensive,"These covers are good looking and inexpensive. I think for the price they are a great bargain. I am about to buy another one (or two) for my loveseat.I really love it because I can take it off and throw it in the washer. I have two for my rocker so that I can cover it with one while I wash the other. (I have a 2 year old, so things can get messy often.)The throw is just a big piece of pretty fabric (that, in my opinion, looks better in real life than in the picture). The only downfall I see is that there is no elastic or sewing to make it fit on a certain type of chair, so we have to use clips to hold it in place. (BTW, the only clips that I could find were at Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't remember the name of them and I don't have the packaging anymore.)Overall, this is a great buy."
3,Lenox etchings Candle Lamp,The lamp was received promptly and in excellent condition. We gave it to our daughter-in-law for her birthday and she truly enjoys it.
3,It's Not Easy Being Green,My mistake - I thought this was a Children's book but I did pass it on to my daughter which she will use for a gift.
4,Short but good,"I thought the book was too short (as has been mentioned). And, I thought it was a little random on what they chose to include.However... it's Jim Henson! Yeah! You can't really go wrong with Henson! So, ok... yeah... it's an awesome book!"
5,The sweetest book I've ever read,"I too am a Muppet ""junkie"". They just remind me of my childhood. My hubby and I have acutally been renting Muppet Show DVDs just to laugh. We watched one episode a while back where Kermit said that he would marry Miss Piggy but his wife wouldn't let him. We were totally cracking up! You just don't see stuff like that anymore.Anyway, this book is so sweet. Kermit is the best ever. This book is for the young and the ""30/40 somethings"" as well. I've had the songs Rainbow Connection and I'ts not easy being Green stuck in my head for days now since purchasing this book. It's inspirational and you'll actually enjoy having those songs stuck in your head if you too grew up with the Muppet Gang."
4,A Little Book of Voices,"Jim Henson was a much liked and well respected person when he was alive. Even after he passed away, people still say wonderful things about him. This book is one of the proofs. It is a compilation of some of Mr. Henson's sayings, his characters' entertaining droll words, his friends' outlooks of him, and his family's reminiscence. The expressions included are motivational, very much like the man himself. He left behind a great deal of artistic faculty to his friends and family. This collection is a quick fun read."
4,Jim Henson,"I enjoy Jim's writings because he relates not only to kids but adults as well. My wife often says I'm a 60 year kid, but as a senior pastor of a mid-size church I enjoy working humor into the sermons and Jim is a great source for that.I really enjoyed reading the book."
3,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed by this book. I expected it to be more like The Wisdom of Big Bird (I highly recommend). Instead, it was full of Henson quotes. It's not easy being green, but I will always be a Muppet fan."
3,Reads Like a Eulogy,"I have always been a huge fan of the Muppets show, and was hoping to learn more about Jim Henson, the creator of and driving force behind the Muppets when I discovered this little book. Instead, it is essentially a collection of quotes by Jim Henson, his co-workers, his family, and his Muppet characters, and as such, it reads more like a eulogy than anything else.Although bracketed by a loving tribute by his daughter Cheryl, and a brief (4 page) biography at the end, I would have liked to see more narrative of Jim Henson's life and philosophy connecting the quotes. I think I'll go check out a Jim Henson biography instead, or best yet, watch some old Muppet show re-runs!"
5,Brilliant overview of water and our relationship to it,"This valuable bvook points out lots of things that we maybe always knew as well as informing us about lots of new aspects such as the memory of water and how this affects all the water in the world and in our bodies. It links humans with a watery world in an intelligent way to give a fascinating overview of the whole subject of water, looking at traditional sacred views of water through conventional scientific analysis into esoteric or less well-known ones. And it gives lots of up to the minute information about helaing with water, both through healthy drinking practices and bathing."
4,Good background Material.,"This author uses a holistic approach towards the analysis of water and its impact on health. She tones down the more fantastic claims while advancing the preponderance of global ritualistic historical practices and their logical connection to certain scientific knowledge based on the understanding that the human body is mainly liquid and that liquids communicate. This book becomes a robust support to Masaru Emto's ""The Hidden Messages in Water"" (2004)."
2,Five Fur Traders of the Nothwest,"Poor book in your looking for information on Peter Pond in the Northwest Fur Trade, generally not of use to me."
2,speaker phone iffy,"I got this phone because I needed a simple corded phone with a good speakerphone--and this part does not work well. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If I switch to the handset during a ""bad"" speakerphone connection, that doesn't work either. I can hear them but they can't hear me. I'm sending it back. Sigh"
1,Instant Death,"After about a year this (for me) expensive phone died. I liked the speaker phone function, and I'll miss it. I've returned to my old, reliable, free (yes, I got it for free) AT&T phone. Sometimes in life, a step back is actually a step forward."
3,good but i would have made the ending come out differently,"I thought this was a good book but i get so annoyed how Sierra never comes to her senses about things. She 16, no boyfriend. When she finnally gets one she makes an excuse im not ready yet. Come on shes 16! Give me a break she cares more about a friend than a boyfriend!"
4,"Good, but....","This is a good purchase for $4.99, especially if you like the more unusual films to come out of the silent era, or any of the Oz books. It's a fun romp through Oz, and has some decent special effects.The film itself has deteriorated substantially, and it appears no effort was made to restore it. That's understandable, especially for such a cheap movie. The bad part of this disc is the audio. The music is a mix of ragtime and various other types. It has some relevance, as the mood does change with the film, but that's about all. The voice-over for the title cards, on the other hand, is just wrong.My conclusion: Buy the movie, but turn the audio off."
2,Not what I expected from other reviews...,"I don't know alot about old movies, especially not silent film, or anything before the 40's, so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy. Most of the shots were very long, repetitive, and boring. It was rare for a scene to have much editing at all, it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that doesn't tell much of a story at all. The woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious. In my opinion, I'd rather read it myself than have it read to me. I don't like that voice there. As some of the other reviewers have said, some of the effects and costuming worked very well. Very impressive for the time. The direction, action, and pacing/storytelling just didn't seem to work well at all for me. Very slow. I fell asleep several times and had to rewind. If you want a good silent film, check out Steamboat Bill, Jr. Excellent."
3,This is what Europe should sound like in the 2000's.,What you get here is your typical power metal dose and a twist of AOR hardrock with a Joey Tempest kind of voice. The result is a little bit cheesy but very catchy. I'm sure the band can do better than that. Some great songs but nothing memorable all in all.
2,Questionable Data,"I didn't buy this book, I just looked at a few pages available using the Amazon 'Search Inside' capability. The first page of the first chapter, Pink Ford, had two factual errors. It called the pink Ford a 1955 model (It was a 1956) and said it had a V6 engine (it had a straight six). If someone is interested in historical accuracy, it might be better to look for another book."
5,Oh yeah...,If you like 80s hair bands and metal/hard rock you'll love this one. Even more so if you like hard rocking women.
3,Hasn't aged well....,"If you want to go back to the days of cheesy metal this is for you.. Especially if you want it played by some slightly overweight chicks in spandex and singing with funny accents, which saves this stuff from being total rubbish.."
5,Very handy book,""" Jews in American Politics"" should be in the the library of every person interested in the Jewish American experience. It contains not only a group of impressive essays but also an amazing assemblage of facts and statistics on things such as The Jewish vote and other political matters. The essays make for great reading and the statistical section make the book a very useful reference work.There really is nothing like the book available to people thinking and writing and teaching about Jews in America."
5,Twin Mates for girls,"I purchased this bed for my 3 and 4yr old granddaughters. I am on a budget so I have to purchase one bed at a time. The bed is just great and color is just fine for a girls room. Just decorate it with girlie beddings. It is much larger than I expected. Very sturdy for toddlers who like to jump on their bed. I am going to purchase a second one very soon. I took my husband 5-6 hrs to assemble the bed but it was worth it.South Shore Furniture, Prairie Collection, Twin Mates Bed 39"", Country Pine"
5,Very Nice,"Its a great bed, the shipping was right on time and assembly was not hard at all. My son loves the bed and his mother loves the storage space. Overall we are happy with the purchase. Also matched the existing furniture to a T!"
2,Decent.,"Combination set, we like the color.The set is easy to assemble, nicely packed for the shipping.The quality, in particular for the bed, is somewhat lower than the competition (Ikea) for a similar product, this has three drawers but they are smaller and there is more room left on their back.The mattress bottom is solid (and too thin) where competition is more breathable and firm.The drawers are a bit flimsy and do not slide all that easy.The set is reasonable for the price and arrives in perfect condition."
4,Great Product But Hard work,"Wow this is an excellent twin bed. When I ordered it I was worried if I can assemble it or not, as I read the reviews about taking a long time to assemble. This came in securely shipped from Amazon. I started unpacking with a panic but when I started assembling I felt more comfortable as the instruction were very good and explicate. it took me about 3 hours to assemble the bed but it was a great project with my son. The hardest parts were the drawers. the rest was peace of cake to assemble. The quality of the bed is very good for under $150 the price I paid. I would recommend to a friend as good quality and a day to spend on a project with a loved one."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I ordered this bed for my 4-year old as he was outgrowing his toddler bed. I had my sights on this bed for awhile; however, I was hesitant based on some poor reviews and the fact it was made from particle board. I decided to take a chance and ordered the bed using Amazon's free shipping and it still arrived ahead of the schedule delivery. It arrived intact with no cracks or other signs of defects as others had experienced. Assembly was easy; those claiming difficulty were either incapable of operating a phillips screw driver or looking at directions. Even with the drawers installed, there is still plenty of usable storage space behind the drawers for items such as seasonal clothing. To access this additional space, simply move the mattress and lift the included bunkie board which consists of two half pieces - not that hard. If you're looking for a decent bed and don't wish to spend a lot of money, this bed is highly recommended."
2,broken bed,parts are broken; parts are cracked; fittings don't fit. Can't return package because I can't lift it; besides already started to put it together when discovered broken pieces.wasted my money
4,Great Space Saver,If you are looking to save space in a room this is the way to go. Its easy to assemble and looks pretty good in any setting. Plus it eliminates at least one dresser with the drawers underneath. Good value for the money.
2,Not recommended,Pieces of the wood came split. Had to glue it so I wouldn't break anymore. Wood also split when you attached it to another piece. Would not purchase this product again.
1,south shore furniture,This product took hours to put together. Directions were not easy to follow. I am very disappointed with this product and would not order anything from this company again.sherril l crouch
1,Came Broken,"It came broken!! But its made of press board, what can you expect? Very cheap, I don't expect it to last long at all. It'll break in a couple of weeks."
3,There are no 2 parts...,"I couldn't done.1) I ordered color of Country Pine, but I received one part of white. I will use that hiding part...2) A part no ""B"" was cracked. Your packing has big problem. I will use that hiding part, too...3) I didn't received 2 parts : 2 of part no ""229"" & 2 of part no "" 129""4) I want to receive those things quickly."
4,Furniture,Nice product.. great for 4 year old boy.. Somewhat easy to assemble.. Nothing broken upon arrival. My son loves the bed... makes a lovely set
5,Solid sturdy construction. Better than big box store,I got 2 of these and am very pleased with how solid and sturdy they are. I'm not saying that you can do a power bomb off the top rope onto them but they are way better than anything you would find at wally world and other big box stores. Good beds.
3,More intense than the odors it eliminates,"Use the tiniest spray possible. The product does annihilate odors, but it also leaves behind a heavy, lingering, ultimately obnoxious orange smell all its own. Absolutely unsuitable for the work place."
4,"Spicy, Natural Citrus Spray","Length:: 0:29 MinsI've been using this all around the house.The smell is very pleasing and fresh.In the kitchen, it will help neutralize cooking odors. It's great for bathrooms and pet's bedding areas, trash cans, litter boxes, etc."
4,great product but price here is much higher than elsewhere,"This is a wonderful product for eliminating odors around the house. No purfumey small - just real lemon with a fresh scent. The price on Amazon, however, is much higher than in my local grocery store - even with tax. Shop around. You can find it cheaper!"
1,Second Can Failure,"Have used this product for several years and it does work well for odor control. However, in the past month I have had two cans fail - not by failing to spray as others have noted (safe) but by failing to turn off (dangerous). I tried to lift the spay button on the last one to stop it and it blew right off and shot the very irritating concentrate into my face wearing glasses kept it out of my eyes) and all over the bath until I could rush it to the sink and let it empty itself down the drain. I called the customer comment number printed on the can - disconnected. Will never buy again - lucky it wasn't a young child."
4,Story of a rich girl,"I think this story is a repeat of every ""rich girl with parents who don't love her"" tale. This story starts out with a young boy dieing, then shows him in the 1960's at a funeral of a woman he used to watch over. It then fast forwards to the 1970's and into the life of a young girl named Robin, who has filthy rich parents, who depend on the maids to take care of their child. As the story progresses, one can see that the story begins to focus more on the evils of life, which are shown through children, adults, and teenagers. As Robin grows up, hanging out with the wrong crowds, etc., her guardian angel is always there to defend her from the evils of life. To bad that at end, she dies from an overdose of Esctasy in a hotel room in the early '80's. Finding her, in what is supposed to ""Hell"" he goes to find her. The end. It shows how different family and friends can be through the ages, but it's a story that's been heard before."
5,Unique Skate Punk!,"Alcoholiday is an excellent cd. If you are a fan of Mxpx, Screeching Weasel, or Blink 182 you will be a fan of mi6! Songs on this album are pretty awesome. Songs like Jeff Brown have awesome beats, and unique lyrics. Jeff Brown is about some guy who gave mi6 a bad review and how they want him to apologize to them. This is a very funny band, much like Blink 182 but not quite. They have more of a punkier beat and the vocalist is not whining. I strongly suggest you buy this cd it is awesome!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"Mi6 is a great band. i hate stereotypes but i gotta say, they've got a good skate punk rock. they're the next nofx. their 5 stars on my list. My Lizzard Had A Keg Party is the best song!!! it's an awesome CD. buy it, it's worth it!"
5,"My wicked,Wicked Ways",I have read this book more than five times and will say that this book is a 5 star book. Please buy it and read it and you will enjoy it.
2,Flynn would not approve!,"I was THRILLED to learn a hard bound volume was available to replace my ancient paperback. But then I received the book and began rereading it... Half way through, it is falling apart. (I don't abuse books by a long shot.) Be aware that the rather steep price will bring you a shrink-wrapped volume, with no dust cover, that is NOT a properly bound book. The printing, too, is sub-par. ... (Get the new paperback! Great edition of a wonderful story!)"
5,The fame of the reckless father doomed the son.,"Errol Flynn's life created a legend which his son Sean struggled to top. Sean Flynn and friend Dana Stone were captured in Cambodia during 1970 and disappeared. Readers of Errol's book will definitely want to read the aptly titled upcoming ""Inherited Risk"" by Jeffrey Meyers, one of the best father-son stories ever written."
3,Enjoy with a liberal grain of salt,"If everything Flynn (or, more accurately, his ghostwriter...does anyone *really* think he wrote this book...?) describes actually happened that way, Flynn led an extraordinarily adventurous life. And there's probably no denying that he did lead a wild one. But I strongly suspect that whoever wrote this book, put a charming polish on the facts. And perhaps the same can be said with any autobiography--especially Hollywood ones. Nevertheless, this is a good read, but I'd say it's just one version of Errol Flynn's life; the version he wanted to be remembered for."
5,"My Wicked, Wicked Ways","Patricia Puddle, author ofVelvet Ball and The Broken Fairy (Volume 1)andStar-Crossed Rascalssaid:I loved this book and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. Whether it's true or not, and I believe it is, it made me laugh my head off. What a funny, daredevil of a man. But it was also very sad that Errol Flynn was lost to us all so early in his life.I highly recommend it, especially if you love adventure."
5,In like Flynn,"Great read, though his style of writing and lopsided story line is from a whole other world. Easily one of the best read's for a while. Helps to understand one of Australia's greatest hollywood star's of all time."
4,walinja,Great book! Didn't realize the remarkable lifestyle he lead before his acting career. It's a book where you take your time to read. WJR
5,autobiography,"Most of this book is accurate, but some of it still leaves you wondering how much was fabricated to enhance the stars notoriety. Errol Flynn's private life was as glamorized as on the screen. What he lived didn't need to be embellished because the whole world followed his escapades almost daily in the newspapers and trade sheets. This is a fun read, full of humor and a look at the world before progress stepped in."
3,Young Widows - 'Settle Down City' (Jade Tree),"Power trio from Louisville, Kentucky. This appears to be their first {so far} CD. Best described as post-punk. Tunes I found to be the most inspiring were the title track ""Settle Down City"", ""The Charmers"", the aggressive ""Mirror F**ker"" and ""We Didn't Know"". Didn't exactly knock me out, you understand it's JUST that this genre of music has been done over so numerous times before. Line-up: Evan Patterson-guitar & vocals, Nick Thieneman-bass & vocals and Geoff Paton-drums. Might appeal to fans of Black Cross, The Melvins, Gang Of Four and Refused."
4,Looking to go pale.,"David Thomas' creative brainchild borders on the very strange; looping drum lines and beats over his disconnected and demonic vocals. Thomas sends effects swirling around the room, not sparing any vibrato, and makes eloquent use of the effects on Melodeon and Musette. Keith Moline's guitar lines are wonderfully interconnected with the cacophony, giving the listener an ominous feeling of impending doom. Not forgetting the horn player, Andy Diagram's trumpets provide an ambient tone reminding one of ""Bitches Brew"" by Miles Davis. ""New Orleans Fuzz"" follows a 12-bar with loops, and even captures a bit of the Cajun city's Creole rhythms on record. ""Nebraska Alcohol Abuse"" leaves no questions in the listeners mind, but the absence of a band throughout the record intrigues as to what the Two Pale Boys would be like live. [...]"
3,Not a bad timepiece,"Light, durable, and unique design that's all i can say. Also you'll receive complements on it, but that's as far as it goes. The white band discolor quite fast to gray and it's fraying on the edge in less than a month. Furthermore, have to be careful w/ the strap link that attached to the band because if it catches on anything it'll take the watch right off your wrist."
4,Good watch...great price.,Nice and light watch. Looks nice. Band is a bit thick and difficult to secure. Will probably replace the watch band.
4,Great for Cleaning Bluray movies,I use these to clean any paticles and dust that might find their way onto the surface of my Bluray movies.These cloths don't leave ANY scratches or residue if whatsoever.Anyone looking for a decent nonabrasive cloth to clean their Blurays and dvds might want to give this one a try.
3,Its ok,"My baby liked it, so i like it, but it was kinda sour.Pear and wild blueberries are much better :) and has 1 gr less sugar!"
2,Not for D5100....,"The fit and threading is okay. However, when you place this on a D5100 (or 5000) you are likely to get a ""lens not attached"" message. You can use the camera in ""manual"" mode, but them you will have to set aperture, iso, etc. manually. If you want to be able to use this with a lens, but have the camera automatically set aperture, iso, etc., it won't work - since the camera does not recognize that a lens is attached and there is no way I know of to bypass that."
4,Works as intended,"Put the lens on the adapter, put the adapter on a Celestron mount, and I can now use my telescope as a 700mm lens (or 1400mm with a 2x barlow lens thrown in).The adapter is a little snug on my Nikon D60, but just take a little care when taking it on and off and I've had no problems."
1,returned,"I was hoping to attach my camera, D-5000, to my spotting scope, but it has a silly thread MM thatI could not find a DCA to attack to my spotting scope."
1,ATTWOOD drink holder,Trash !!!!! Junk!!! not worth the cardboard box it came in better off using the box and throwing the drink holder away.
4,Superb performance. Meven is spectacular!,"This is a superb performance, perhaps the best on record, CD and DVD. No other bass rivals Meven in the role of Frier Lawrence. Other soloists and conductor are at their best. The only drawback is the 4:3 format and stereo only sound."
4,Excellant Product,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT I RECEIVED. THE PRICE WAS GREAT AND I PLAN TO ORDER MORE.
5,A literary delight,"The greatness of Johnson's Dictionary is in good part in its literary quality. Johnson is a writer of great verve, humor, satiric sharpness, moral insight and wit. The Dictionary is of course not to be chewed and digested, but rather to be tasted for its special treats. An abridgement like this provides the reader with a more portable source of pleasure, a volume which can be schlepped along , and read on bus or train. I would strongly recommend that along with this work the reader get a hold of Hitchings work on the story of the making of the Dictionary."
2,Disappointing,"Received my copy of this ""Modern Selection"" and admit that it was at best, disappointing as a representation of some of Dr. Johnson's work. Not really worth a place in my library."
1,itchy itch,"The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch, and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings--I will never buy 50 50 blends again, 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum-- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible."
3,good enough?,"For a long time, I wanted to buy a phone that would work during power-outages.This definitely was what I was looking for, except for a few annoying flaw. There are plenty of corded telephones in the market, and I would have reconsidered this purchase if I knew about these ahead of time.CONS:- VERY short cord. (between base and the handset)- NO caller ID.- The ""low"" ring volume is not low enough and I end up turning it off instead.- There is NOT WAY that you'll be able to do ANYTHING without the manual. There are a few non-intuitive steps involved with doing just about anything, including raising and lowering the volume and turning the ringer off/on.- Hard to read LCD display. (no backlight and not enough contrast)PROS:- Good quality speaker system- Works without a power outlet and during potential outages.- Large keypad and buttons."
5,Dar,"wonderful to watch, was disappointed that the extras songs wernt on the Dvd. very entertaing and fun to watch."
2,It's Entertainment,"I love Celtic Thunder. They are all awesome and talented men. I do not care for the direction that the music is headed however. I too want to hear them sing Celtic songs. I was very disappointed with this DVD. The original Celtic Thunder is one that I can watch over and over, skipping over the ""pop"" songs. This one was just hard for me to watch, and I know that I don't want to watch it again."
2,"Pleasant enough but have they ""sold out"" on their Celtic roots?","Whats happened to Celtic Thunder? Its now more like Celtic Drizzle!They should have preserved the true roots of Celtic music in their shows. Now its just commercial stereotyped hokey pop/show song performances that have been done far better by others. Blandest version of Hallelujah I have heard! They even appeared on a Shopping Channel flogging their wares - that was painful.Probably pleasant enough fare targetting US audiences but I think this direction will affect their ""marketability"" and appeal in other countries like UK, Ireland and Australia. Poor quality DVD transfer( unfortunately this is what we have come to expect from CT DVDs) and production values. A bland disappointing presentation overall."
2,Different but not better,"I had been so impressed with The Show that I subsequently grabbed everything coming from Celtic Thunder. I had just received my much anticipated pre-ordered copy and finished watching this new show. I still like the guys, nice and easy on the eye, but this time I think there's something seriously amiss, probably the material they chose to perform which didn't go well with their style. If I didn't see them before then I'd definitely say this is a very average group and doesn't deserve the attention they get."
4,"If you're a fan, you'll love it","I know a lot of people don't like this DVD or CD because it delves away from Celtic Thunder's ""traditional"" roots, but I personally am a big enough fan of their music and the show itself that it doesn't bother me that much. Their vocal talents are as amazing as ever, and you can tell in their performances that they are truly enjoying themselves. This DVD is definately worth it for a diehard CT fan. The bonus features include a half-hour long feature called ""Celtic Thunder: the story so far"" which, in my opinion, makes the DVD more than worth it. It includes audition footage, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with all five Celtic Thunder men. This DVD is a great addition to any Celtic Thunder library."
2,DVD itself is REALLY BAD Quality!,"I have watched this same performance on PBS and really liked it. Unfortunately, after receiving the DVD, it is obvious that whoever created it does not have quality control included in their active vocabulary.First, the group itself, their performances and their vocals are top notch. For the group itself and their performing talent, I would rate them 5 stars, out of 5.But, the entire second half of the DVD I received was so incredibly bad it could not be watched or even listened to. I used the same dvd player I have used for a long time and never had a problem with it UNTIL when playing this dvd. My player also worked fine with other dvds after taking this inferior quality one out. The entire 2nd HALF of this DVD is jerky, contains small green squares, and even the singing is broken up and not smooth and fluid because of the completely low quality of the dvd disc itself. Do not be ripped off. Do not order this one."
1,It's Entertainment,"I have tried to play this disc in three different cd players, two of them insist there is no disc in player and the other one ejects it. I needto send it back. I cant review it unless, I can listen to it."
2,Disappointed,I'm sorry Celtic Thunder is getting away from their roots. I became of fan because I like Irish music. I can hear American music everywhere. There is so much Irish music to sing why did they waste half the show with Broadway and other American tunes? Very disappointed.
4,Where's the rest of the concert? . . .,"The guys were great, the music was great . . . but we only got 52 minutes out of a two-hour concert? What's that all about? When does Part II come out?"
4,Excellent work,"My 95 yo mother loves watching these guys. The music is good, the material is not over the top. I like the special features more, I've seen these DVDs 3 or 4 times now."
5,It's different but I love it! Amazing!,"This is different from the first two Celtic Thunder's DVDs... They did a performance by old american songs, kind of funny and relaxed... I'm brazilian and I love it as the other two!"
5,Celtic thunder - entertainment,We have been avid Celtic thunder fans since we first heard about them on PBS. I believe we have every DVD they have made and we love them. Every so often we go back to the first DVD they made to compare how much Damian McGinty has grown. We will continue to buy their DVD's whenever a new one comes out.
5,outstanding,"This group of Celtic men deserves to be heard by all music lovers. Their voices are fantastic, the production is beautifully done and visually stunning. I loved the variety of music they produce. Best of all is the enthusiasm and joy projected by the entire group.Not to mention how beautiful the lads are to look at especially when they end the show in their kilts. They have become my favorite music group of all and I share that with a lot of ""thunderheads"". I would also like to recommend purchasing the first two DVD's, Celtic Thunder and Celtic Thunder, The Show. Buy them.....you won't be sorry.Pat"
4,It's Entertainment is Entertaining,"Celtic Thunder's latest cd of It's Entertainmnet is very entertaining. However it is not your usual CT music--as the fans were aware of, during their 4 minute preview video. It is a variety of music through the years and not their traditional sound....With that being said it is a great show, but their IRISH ROOTS are definately something that is missed (along with their kilts)! It is still an enjoyable cd and dvd, just not as much as their previous endevors, sorry to say. Surely you will still be quite entertained by the variety of their musical talents, thats a given!! P.S. It is fantastic that Neil is now a Celtic Thunder singer as well. He does a wonderful job and hopefully Sharon and Phil will continue having him add to the charisma of CT along with his background performance as well."
1,Not so much.....,I too wondered what all the screaming was about with these guys. I watched this program and didn't even finish it. It isn't Celtic or even exellent singing. I'm not sure what the novelty is. They should stick to their origins. This stuff has been covered over and over again.
3,A Little Disappointed,I really enjoy listening to and viewing these talented singers but the DVD in question is merely a compilation of recent material. i wil be a bit reluctant to order another unit based upon the title alone.
5,Totally different for Celtic Thunder!!!,"What fun and how different this performance was. Paul doing the 20's thing, Ryan's version of Leroy Brown, Damien doing his first dancing, Keith's surfing songs...brought back lots of fun memories and made new ones. Very well done! We miss you Paul!!!"
3,Good but to much of a U.S. sound,"We've enjoyed this DVD. The more mature sounding youngster was welcomed, his last DVD was in transistion. Other than wanting more of the Celtic music, the production was very good."
5,"Celtic Thunder, It's Entertainment","This is perhaps, the best show that Celtic Thunder has done. Their first release,Celtic Thunder, was outstanding, and I was wondering how they could possibly improve, but they did. Celtic Thunder has raised the bar in musical entertainment. Bravo!"
1,Celtic Garbage,This is by far the worst music they have ever produced. You can hear better performances on American Idol. Not a note of Celtic music on the entire DVD. Don't waste your money.
4,Great Entertainment,"They have done it again!!! This dvd will take the public by storm - as always!!! You can tell that the artists have a great time putting their own spin on these songs, many of which they chose from some of their favorite artists. This music is a departure from previous performances but I find it an interesting, refreshing and fun collection of songs which speak to all ages. You can't help but be totally taken in by each of their performances, you clap your hands, sing along and just have great time.I am glad that Neil Byrne finally has a more active singing role, his voice is amazing.All in all, I love the wide variety of music and as always, the guys are simply great.One negative comment: lose most of the female dancers and bring back Zara. The blond dancer with Ryan in ""Every Breath you take"" comes across as so totally bored, it's almost amusing. Contrary to some of the dancers in this dvd, Zara ""speaks' to her audience with just her eyes and facial expression."
4,Very pleasing performance,"The Celtic Thunder Blu Ray arrived in new condition and played through flawlessly. Hve enjoyed the entire disc from start to finsih including the behind the scens making of the ""group"". They gave an interesting rendition of som classis like Surfin Safari, Bad Leroy Brown, and even a hint of some country. The biggest weakness I would note was ot so much with the performance but the set was a bit uninspiring. All in all, the DVD is worth having in your collection."
5,Wonderful,"This is a great dvd, the concert is awesome. I totally recommend it for those who like good music."
5,Another home run!!,Got this on a Saturday and it played on one room or another all day. Kids love it as much as we do and had all the songs and dances memorised by nightfall. Our first grader even took it to school to show her teacher (at the teacher's request after she talked about it) and class. The harmony is outstanding and the personalities of all the guys really shine!!
2,"Not ""My"" Celtic Thunder","Let me first say that I am a true Celtic Thunder fan. I have the first three CD's before this one, the xmas CD done by Paul, and I have gone to two of the live concerts. I would rate all of these 5 stars. Then we come to ""it's Entertainment"". I can understand the group wanting to try new things, but whoever picked out much of this music did not do right by them this time. This wonderful group of men deserve better. There are a couple of really nice pieces, but much of this CD to me at least, sounds like they are trying to sound like ""polyester lounge lizards"", and music like that you can get anywhere. Please go back to sounding like the wonderful Celtic group that you stand out as."
5,Must Have,"I too was at the taping and was just blown away at the professionalism and song choices. When you find yourself rocking in your seat along with the performers, then you know you got a gem and at such a bargain price! These gUys have what it takes and let me tell you they deliver pure ENTERTAINMENT!"
2,Worst Celtic Thunder show I've seen,I love the Celtic Thunder group and all work done by Phil Coulter and Sharon Browne but this show on DVD is terrible not at all like the last two shows which were great. Are we at the point where we are taking the public for granted. Entire show was of poor quality. I hope future shows are better. I couldn't wait for this release since the past two shows were great. We need to see the guys singing better quality material than on this show. Also where are the Irish songs on this DVD?
5,Love it,Anything by Celtic Thunder is great. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it.
5,Noro Morales,"...The CD is super, one of the best I have listened to.......I want to purchase another oneOld time Puerto Rican music..great for listening or dancing....Morales is ultra super when it comes to piano....his solos soar, and the rythym is fantastic......."
4,"There is nobody like Noro, simply put, A MASTER PIANIST","All the recordings in this album are considered gems of popular latin music. Nobody can play them like Noro. His hands flow so easily thru the keyboards that it seems only him could play them. Probably you have never herd of him, but after you do I'm sure you wll agree with me, there is nobody like Noro!!!!"
3,Inevitable,"This true story of a father and son dive team is well written and throughly researched. I enjoyed reading about the pair's interest in recreational diving and subsequent interest in technical diving. However, the book clearly portrays them as pushing the envelope ever further, even past the limits to which their friends and mentors were comfortable with. Their experiences on the Andrea Dorea only served to bolster their confidence, which I believe, led to their ultimate demise on the ""U-Who"".As a certified diver, I enjoyed the book. However, it was similar to the movie The Perfect Storm in that these men are portrayed as heroes or martyrs when in fact they died by their own hand, as a result of taking unnecessary risks."
4,How a bad arbidgedment can kill an audio book,"""The Last Dive"" has two of the three keys to a great audio book. First, there is Kevin Conway's gripping naration of the text. His voice makes the words real and draws you into the panic on the dive boat that fateful day. Next is the strong details provided in the text by Bernie Chowdhury that allowed me as a non diver to understand the drive these men and women have. But the arbidgement is awful. Just plan bad. Major sections of the book dealing with the author are introduced and then droped. While books of this detail are hard to abridge, ""BlackHawk Down"" is a classic example of how a very detailed book can be abridged the right way."
4,The Last Dive - Bernie Chowdhury,"""...for man's true purpose in life is to live, not to waste time merely sustaining himself."" - Jack London as quoted by Bernie ChowdhuryAs an aspiring tech diver I found this inspirational while at the same time setting off warning bells as to what I intend getting into. Chowdhury tells the tragic tale of Chris and Chrissy Rouse intermingled with the technicalities of extreme diving, the psychological aspects of what make extreme divers tick and presents a good historical account of sport and technical diving.An excellent read which must go highly reccommended to all sport and technical divers - novice and swordsman alike."
4,An interesting view into cave and wreck diving,"I enjoyed the book a great deal. The book is a lot more than just the story of the lives, diving careers and death of the Rouse's though that's an interesting story in itself. It's a great insight into the world of cave and deep wreck diving/penetration. It goes into a lot of the technical aspects of this extreme sport. It offers insights into the people who participate in the sport. I'm strictly a recreational diver, open water instructor actually, and I have no personal interest in the kind of diving that drove the characters in this book but it's still a fascinating read. I found it well written, informative and entertaining. I recommend it to divers and non divers alike."
3,Too Long,"This book had the potential for a gripping narrative of a father and son's battle with the depths but fell short of that goal. Choudry practically circumnavigated the globe before he arrived at the topic of the book. After he described in nauseating detail, the Rouse's family background, he went into great depth of the technical aspects of diving. This made parts of the book read like a diving manual. Finally, he proposed a somewhat absurd Freudian type analysis of why some divers go deeper than others. While I found the tales of the dives to Andrea Doria and other wrecks quite fascinating the other topics were just unecessary. Only about two chapters were devoted to the actual accident. The story could have been told in half the pages."
2,How to make stupidity heroic,"How can you make a hero out of people who broke the rules they are supposed to live by? This book is well written, but spends too much time glamorizing idiocy. If you read this book, don't think that all tech divers are self indulged egomaniacs like Chowdhury."
3,Too bad it wasn't Chowdhury's last dive!,"This book is a good read for divers interested in the technical aspect of scuba diving, but more than half the book is spent on Chowdhury's own diving tales, including the story of how he got bent, partially paralyzed, etc. As I read I couldn't help but get the impression that this was more of an ego trip of Chowdhury's than a tale of a tragic father/son diving accident.Chowdury's personal reverie doesn't contribute much to the story, but added pages to the book, thereby increasing the purchase price of the book!P.S. Don't blame Michele for this review. I'm her husband, Dan Benson!"
5,A moving tale of a father and son,"This is by far one of the most gripping accounts of diving you will ever read. The author takes you on several voyages of discovery with a father and son diving team. The fact that the author doesn't write in chronological order might be a little distracting to some, but this is a remarkable book."
4,Daedulus and Icarus of the Deep,"The protagonists of the book, a father-son scuba team, were destined to meet a nasty end. Chowdhury clearly likes and respects his former dive buddies, but his honesty brings out the tragic character flaw shared by this buddy team that ultimately sunk them both - a destructively competitive attitude that one day turns into a quest to push the limits on diving to make a point. Like the birdman Icarus who flew too close to the sun, the kid in this tale pushes too close to the limits trying to achieve glory in the field of deep wreck diving and finds disaster instead. Unlike the Greek myth, in this tale the father ""Daedulus"" goes down with the son. Chowdhury also shares his own brush with death while performing an ill-advised wreck dive. A compelling and instructive tale of what not to do underwater."
4,The Last Dive,"If you have ever been on a wreak dive.If you have ever been on a live abord charter.If you have ever had the men your diving with talk themselves into something they know they shouldn't do ...This book dose not gloss over personalitys .It shows with a reality all too personal.For anyone who dives ,life and death is in your hands as you plan your dive.But as you exicute it , there is no planning for the terror. I know it. I felt it at 70' caught in a fishing net on a wreak in the dark.Bernie knows .He writes of his own experance. And he is man enouf to discuss what happens to himself and his friends.I don't know Bernie.But the folks he dives with are real.If you scuba dive you might see parts of yourself or your dive buddies .A good realistic read."
5,Great,"This book was recommended by a fellow diver and he was right, its a great book. It's an interesting mix of the history and technical aspects of diving along with a great story. For divers or non-divers this is a great read."
2,Didn't work for me,"The title of the book is intriguing, though it sort of leaks the punch line. It could have grabbed potential readers by making them wonder if the duo survives or not. Anyway, a father and son dive to their deaths.First, the author did not make the father and son seem particularly likeable. I thought their constant fighting and bickering was more of a turn off. Second, you wonder if the deaths could have been averted; what could be interpreted by some as courage looks to others like foolhardiness. Third, you wonder at times whether it is the author's primary intent to write about the father and son or about himself. It's almost like he's thinking, ""I'd like to tell people my story and the perfect vehicle to hook them with is the death of this father and son.""I'll admit, the writing is fine and I did keep reading, but the book left me with a bit of a sour feeling in my stomach."
5,A Must Read for Divers and Those Interested,"As a newly certified OW diver, I read this book on the recommendation of my instructor. I would say this is a must read for those with an interest in the world below the surface. Chowdhury does a good job at presenting an overview of diving from a diver's perspective, risk management, wreck and cave exploration, vignettes of the dive community, and a little bit of the story of Chris and Chrissy Rousse. The content of this non-fiction book gets 5 stars from me. The organization and writing style leave room for improvement. Good effort for authorship when one considers the fact that Chowdhury is a diver and not Dickens or Twain. For the diver, this book is an eye-opener. For the non-diver, this a volume of many entries into our world. This book is a gift I will pass onto any of my friends who are new to diving or have an interest in diving."
2,Poor writing mars a brilliant outline,"Don't be fooled by all the dive junkies giving 5-star ratings to this dreck. Unless you're a diver, you'll be bored to tears. If you *are* a diver, be prepared to trudge through uninteresting crap looking for the treasure.The story of the Rouse deaths is merely a hook--their story only takes up a small portion of the book. Essentially, what Chowdhury is pedaling is a history of tech diving. The outline is brilliant, and in the hands of a skilled writer, this could have been a real gem. The prose is mediochre at best. Hard to believe anyone could make so fascinating a topic into a dull read."
3,Interesting but Somewhat Depressing,"The author flashes forward and backward in time, making the ""story"" a little hard to follow. He also repeats himself on several occasions, making the reader wonder why the editing wasn't better. The story is interesting -- a father and son that push the envelope, without being overtly wreckless. Unfortunately, as with most diving accidents, several unfortunate events came together to result in tragedy for the Rouses. Several accidents are described peripherally (not the Rouses) that help the reader learn things to look for when diving themselves -- for example, being overweighted and forgetting to turn his air on before dropping off the boat cost an experienced diver his life. Two mistakes and questionnable judgement (solo diving) is all it took. The book is worth the read for these little gems, but don't look for a happy ending..."
3,An Unnecessary Tragedy,"Let me first say, I do not wish to disrespect the dead. However, the Rouses's deaths were unnecessary and due to machismo and arrogance. I'm a No Deco diver who does not engage in deep dives. The book clearly shows why this sport should not be allowed without taking proper precautions. Just as we would not allow an airliner to take off without having the necessary fuel, maintenance, etc. Divers who cut corners due to cost risk not only their own lives but potentially the lives of rescurers and shipmates."
3,This book tends to repeat,The story and information were interesting and a good read. However the author tends to repeat himself throughout the book.
1,Thoroughly disappointed....,"Perhaps because I knew how it was going to end, I found this book an incredibly slow read. Normally I would put it down after a couple of weeks, but it did get such rave reviews. I felt this book would have been better as a magazine article rather than a book."
4,"Engrossing, though somewhat overwritten","If you are interested in what happens to people who push the limits of extreme sports, you will find this book engrossing. The author, an experienced technical diver himself, combines the true story of a father and son diving team with expository material on the technical and physical challenges of scuba diving at great depths. His descriptions of cave and wreck diving give the reader the sensation of being there. The author describes his own nearly fatal accident as well as the deaths of the father and son team. Their story has the flavor of a Greek tragedy, a predictable fate resulting from high-risk behavior. The author's descriptions of personal interactions within this sporting sub-culture are sometimes more than is needed, particularly when he invents dialogue for conversations he did not hear."
5,Last Dive,"Interesting story for those involved in technical diving.As a diver who enjoys cold water diving and looking for treasure where no one has been before, I strongly recommend this book.I felt like I knew these people. I could have traveled on a dive boat off the coast of NJ with this father and son team and never known it. I felt sorry to have never met these two men. I'm glad Bernie Chowdhury told their story, as well as sharing a piece of his own history as well."
4,Lessons to be Learned,"As a New Jersey diver who has encountered trouble at depth off the Garden State's coast, The Last Dive rang shockingly true. In the spirit of ""Into Thin Air"" and ""A Perfect Storm,"" The Last Dive focuses on what happens when tragedy strikes when the best of the best just isn't good enough.My only criticism of the book would be that there's too little about the U-boat that plays such a large role in the characters' lives, and perhaps a bit too much about the author's own experiences and feelings. While they are perfectly valid and relevant to the book, the book's ending trails off as a result. Nonetheless, a great summer book and one that divers will certainly enjoy before passing on to non-diving family and friends."
2,Duffy,"Maybe I shouldn't write my review, because I didn't finish the book, but it just isn't good. This is supposed to be a tragic story of a father and son that lose their life to a sport they thoroughly enjoy, yet all I get from the writing is a couple of guys who are arrogant and immature. Chowdhury goes between writing technical diving information to dialogue between characters, that reads hollow and adolescent. Not a good read for me. If you're into diving and wrecks, ready Kevin McMurray. He's BRILLIANT!!!"
5,Must read for serious divers,This is the best diving book I have read - and I have read more than a few. It traces the history of diving and gives vivid description of cave diving as well as deep wrecks. It was so much more than a story of a doomed dive. The story of the dive has been told in Shadow Divers - another great book for divers to read - but this one is just superior in so many ways.
4,The Last Dive,"As a person with much in common with several of the divers featured in the book, and having met a few of them (Steve Berman was my cave diving instructor), I was very impressed with the book. The premise of diving the Andrea Doria has been a lifelong desire of mine, ever since watching her sink on the news as a nine year old. I hope to accomplish that next Summer, hopefully from aboard the Seeker. I have had the ""bends"" myself, although not as bad a case as those described. I was forced to make an emergency ascent from 214 ft, omiting all decompression stops. 13 hrs in the chamber in Gainesville, FL did the trick for me. All of Bernie's descriptions are 100% accurate. My Email add is Dvcaves@aol.com"
1,Condoning Stupidity,"To call the two main subjects Chris and Chrissy ""technical divers"" is a real travesty to the responsible tech diving community. The author parades them around as heros, even telling of his own ""bends"" incident.Diving air on the U-Who... they really got what was coming to them."
5,Hard to put down,"If you liked ""Into Thin Air"" you will love this book. It is about the early days of extreme diving and accurately details what some of these early daredevils went through to dive hundreds of feet underwater. At the time, cave diving, mixed air diving, and multi-hour decompression stops were considered crazy. A great book, especially if you are interested in diving."
5,More than just a tragic dive.,This book was a great read. As someone new to diving I thought I would read something on the subject. I imagined it would be the simple documentation of a tragic event. Instead I found an amazing story about not only the Rouse family and their journey into the world of diving and the subsequent tragedy but also the authors own story and his insights into this world. The Last Dive is one of those books you can't put down and it's also incredibly educational on the sport of diving. If you have an interest in diving this is a fantastic book for you.
4,Great book!,I loved The Last Dive and recommend it to divers and non-divers alike. I am familiar with Chris and Chrissy Rouse from reading other books about U-869 and the Andrea Doria. Bernie Chowdhury's characterization of the father and son is right on with other first hand accounts of their diving accomplishments and interactions with each other. I feel like I know both of them personally and wish I'd had the opportunity and pleasure of meeting and diving with them both. I couldn't put the book down.
4,Respect the ocean - it shows no mercy,"About a group of friends who dive to the Andria Dora, ""The Mount Everest of Diving"", at 230 feet below the Massachusetts coast. They also go down to sunken German U-Boats off the New Jersey and New York coast. In one U-Boat, this guy was swimming through the walkway 70 meters down, with his tanks on his sides, when all of a sudden a freaking inflatable life raft inflates - after being sunk for 50 years! The goddam thing traps the guy in the U-Boat, pinning him to the floor!It tells a history of how people throughout the ages have gotten the bends - including the people who worked underwater in caissons building the Brooklyn Bridge, a history of diving, the pain of decompression chambers after being rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter off of a dive charter boat, breathiing mixed gases like helium and guys decompressing for 3 hours on an anchor line after a 30 minute bottom time deep dive."
2,Not Well Written,"While the contents are interesting, the writing is not. Chowdhury repeats himself too often and uses overly-simple writing to convey a long intricate story. I agree with other reviewers that he also discusses himself far too much.The plot is also in a non-linear fashion. While some people can pull this off, Chowdhury doesn't do a very good job of it.To find someone that is as literarily adept as Joyce and be a technical diver at the same time is to expect too much. But it would be nice if there was such a person..."
1,Disappointing,"This book was boring to me. The author went on and on with detailed descriptions of the principles of diving, repeating himself many times. It was very hard to read the story through all this extra detail. It seemed as if the author needed to add the detail to make the story longer but it actually greatly took away from the story. I do not recommend."
3,"A Fascinating Story, But Poorly Told","This book tells a couple of fascinating stories about the danger and psychology of deep diving. Unfortunately, it had the potential to be a much better book than it actually is. The author's habit of meandering off into irrelevant personal details detracts from the story, but the worst offense by far is that he repeats himself. There are at least a dozen plot points or bits of information about people that are repeated three or more times throughout the book. If they ever do a second edition of this, it should be run past a competent editor. As it is, it reads like the first draft of a good book."
2,The Old Which-a -roo!,"Be prepared for the old which-a-roo with this book. The author proclaims the book is about "" A Father and Son's Fatal Descent into the Ocean's Depths"", but can't stop writing about himself. Coming from someone (me), who has an attention span long enough to read a postcard, I could not put down ""Shadow Divers"", having cut my teeth on New Jersey wreck diving a long time ago, although not to the extreme of deep wreck diving. It only seemed natural to follow it up and read ""The Last Dive"", which I have trouble keeping interested in when the author keeps writing mostly about himself. Anyway if you feel compeled to read this book, you should do yourself a favor and check it out from your local library, this way you can return it."
3,Mediocre at best,"This book, ""The Last Dive"" is a poorly written attempt to ride the coat tails of the fantastic book, ""Shadow Divers"". 80% of this book is mindless filler. It's only saving grace is that it presents a good case for safe deep wreck diving."
1,"Read ""Shadow Divers"". Don't waste your time on ""Last Dive"".","This book was every bit as poorly written as the worst reviews here suggest.I kept thinking ""didn't anyone read this before they published it?""The repetition and weak writing in general make it so bad that the little valid information in it continually overwhelmed me into thinking ""this is the worst-written book I have read in a long time.""""Shadow Divers"" was so good that it made me want to read more on the topic. This book, however, was a waste in every way. It may be the first book that I give away rather than keep on my shelf as I will NEVER read it again."
4,"Interesting read, but...","Bernie writes an accurate account of how diving has progressed in the Northeast using a tragic event as a center point. The book is not the best piece of literature I have read, but his writing gets the point across. It was quite interesting to read about so many people I know and have been diving with."
3,Good,"I liked the historical aspect of the book and the way it talks about the early days of diving. I would have given 5 stars but, as a diver, I found it kind of freaky. Might not be great for the new diver."
4,good enough!,"Good price for 25k dry A, which is what many post-bariatric patients like myself end up needing. Seems to be helping on my vitamin A labs. I only give it 4 because I wish more came in a bottle."
5,quality assurance!,"I AM REVIEWING THIS PRODUCT FIRST AS A LICENSED/REGISTERED PHARMACIST, I AM IN A BETTER POSITION BY THE RIGHT OF MY PROFESSIONAL STATUS.USUALLY EMULSIFIED PRODUCT IS A MORE RELIABLE FORMULATION AS OPPOSED TO NON EMULSIFIED FORMULATION.THE PACKAGING OF THE PRODUCT LED CREDENCE TO ITS POSSIBLE SAFETY AND LONG EXPIRATION DATE, AS IT IS ASSUREDELY TAMPERPROOF.THE PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED, YOU STILL NEED THE AWARENESS OF YOUR PHYSICIAN, TO LET YOU KNOW IF YOU NEEDED SUCH A HIGH POTENCY VITAMIN, ALTHOUGH IT IS SOLD AS OVER THE COUNTER.DERINIT IS AN AMAZON VERIFIED PRODUCT"
2,It's okay...,"PROS- Does a lot of bands SW,MW(AM),FM w/TV bandCONS- The reception is awful. I can barely pull in any SW stations, and if I can it's hard to hear and I have to move the radio in the perfect place. FM and AM reception is fair to average. I noticed the tuning of FM is way off from where it says, for example I pick up 104.7 on what looks like 101.5 on the radio.In conclusion, it does a lot of bands but it's reception is awful and it's hard to tune."
3,Fair starter radio,"I have bought several of these little radios over the years. The first one I bought, put batteries in, and turned on received Radio China, Radio Netherlands, and several other stations. I have taken them on trips and given away some to interested persons. It does ok for an inexpensive radio. AM and FM reception is good, I have not heard the TV band yet though."
5,Bonanza Series 4,As with the earlier sets - the quality is amazing. Series 4 has some really great episodes including The Hayburner which Bonanza fans have rated their favourite all time episode as well as the brilliant Elegy for a Hangman and this episode has a great extra of a commentary by Keir Dullea which not only covers the making but sets the background which was during the Cuban Missile Crisis - some interesting historial data. With winter coming up - watching this DVD is a nice way to spend the evenings
5,Bonanza Season 4,Thanks to Spelling Productions and everyone responsible for getting this season of Bonanza out! Please keep them coming; it is so nice to see quality Dvds and the commercials from the 60's and other extra features bring back fond memories. Looking forward to hearing when the next sets will be released. :-)
2,first time,"Since buying from Amazon this is the first time that I have had any issue with the product. In this case, the second disc on volume one wouldn't play on Samsung DVD player. Disc one played fine but not disc two. Haven't attempted the remaing disc's in the set. I guess we'll see."
3,I have been waiting so long,I have been waiting for so long.... it is wonderful to think we can get all 14 seasons. This is the best news I have heard in a long time.
5,Enjoyable,I didn't realize how much was edited out of the reruns until I started buying the DVD's. I have enjoyed watching the new releases of an old family favorite. I am hoping that all the seasons will be released.
4,Super Enjoyable,"Very nice. If you're a novice to classical, you'll really enjoy this CD. Perfect for a Sunday morning coffee or rainy afternoon."
5,Yo Yo Ma always delivers,"This is a good album. The music is not too deep. Many of Vivaldi's concertos sound the same. However, it is always very pleasing to the ears and never boring. Mr. Ma has a great sound and great command on his instrument. He does not play in Baroque style, and yet, he knows how to fit his style of playing just right. These concertos sound natural, extremely clean and the music flows very well. I recommend this album to those who want something light and breezy."
4,Say Hey-ho for Yo-yo No Disappointment Here,I often play European-classical music during massage treatments. My clients love hearing this CD again and again!
4,Gift Purchase,"I purchased this item as a gift for my husband, an avid hunter. It is very large, but a perfect size for all his gear. The ability to carry it on his back while treking through the brush was an added bonus."
3,"not great, size seems misleading","The listed size of 115 Liters seems optimistic. The pack seems to have noticeably less volume that non-waterproof packs with similar (or even slightly smaller) rated capacity. This is compounded by the rubbery material of the pack, which makes stuffing gear more difficult.The straps are simple and uncomfortable compared to what one expects for non-waterproof portage packs.I've only used the pack for one trip so far. It worked. Depending on how the waterproofing holds up to wear, I might go back to lining non-waterproof packs with large (lawn & garden) trash bags. It is a nuisance to do so, but the packs are more comfortable and trash bags are cheap to replace."
1,can't make up it's mind what kind of book to be,"This book begins to suggest that the author is going to help you figure your money personality. After a highly superficial treatment of that topic, she moves on to semi-standard financial advice which is greatly incomplete.While I agree with the other reviewer's comments about Suze, this book isn't worth the time or cost to read."
2,"Once fully charged, won't hold charge for any length of time.","Ok, I figure, being a Lenmar brand, the battery should hold a charge,but it doesn't.I figure I'll give it a complete charge and discharge a few times and a month to determine how reliable the battery is, before any reviews.After you fully charge it, it will work, but don't expect same power length as your original.Also, if you have it fully charge and let it sit for a week, without use, the battery will show empty, when you try to play it.So if you are going to use it, you must charge it the night before. Kind of a pain.One note, to replace the battery was pretty easy, just watch the videos online, took about 10min."
1,Battery Does not Work,"Product was easy to install. Worked initially however I cracked the lcd screen taking the ipod apart. Replaced the screen and plugged the battery back in, no longer works. Won't even charge. Plugged the original battery back in, works great. Ordered a different battery from somewhere else. Piece of junk."
4,Works Very happy saved allot of money,This actually worked! I figured it was worth a less than $20 gamble becuase the ipod store wanted $60 for the battery and $60 to put it in as of (Jan 2012).I have been using it for work outs and it works great. My ipod did not loose a song when I watched a online video how to replace the battery.It just proves it pays $100 to do little homework. Maybe some of the batteries are faulty but mine was not.i will update if this stops working.GREAT DEAL!Update still work fantastic a year later 2013!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great way to replace your iPod battery at a fraction of the cost!,"Instead of paying Apple $80 to replace your iPod battery, simply purchase this item and install it yourself. My iPod, a sentimental first Valentine's Day gift from my husband 6 years ago, was dying. I looked on Apple to find out how to repair it and was shocked that they would charge $80 for an iPod battery when the whole iPod was only $220 when it was new! I purchased this battery on Amazon, had great and quick shipping, and my beloved iPod was back to life in about 10 minutes. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to replace their iPod 5th generation battery!"
2,Ruined a perfectly good old Ipod,I followed the video instructions every thing seemed fine. When I put it all back together nothing happened.took itapartt and the connector prongs came off the circuit board and and was it.
1,Worked for one full charge,After the first charge the life doesn't hold up beyond 5 minutes. I may have just got a bad one if I had to do it again I would send it out and have it done right for a little extra money to have a guarantee.
1,DONT DO IT!!!,"I absolutely do not recommend this item...I am pretty handy with small electronics and fixing things. All of the included tools broke off on the first use...I had to resort to small metal screwdrivers, which also broke. These Ipods are not meant for the consumer to access at ALL!! I now have a completely disfigured rear panel(wont snap back on), a broken connector port(wont plug in) and the list goes on...End result= Destroyed $350 Ipod classic 80gb. USE EXTREME CAUTION WITH THIS KIT!!!"
3,Not a long lasting charge,"The shipping was prompt and received in good order, but I am disappointed in how long it lasts on a charge. It was pretty simple to change out, but I have found it's not lasting much longer than my old battery, 5 or 6 hours. I listen mostly to music, not any video, so I was expecting at least 12-15 hours. Maybe I just got a dud."
1,"Almost, but not quite","My battery failed after two days. After opening my ipod and messing with the battery a couple of times, I found that the connection between the wire and the battery was the issue. There is a soft gummy like material along the edge of the battery where the wire connects. By compacting the area, I am able to get 1-5 days of good use out of it. Unfortunately it still becomes disconnected at random times. I have not taken the battery apart, opened up that area, but I may do so soon. Returning the product seems like a waste of energy if I can get it to work consistently."
2,Couldn't get it to work,"It's probably my fault as much as the battery's, but I couldn't get it to work. I carefully opened up the iPod, took out the old battery and tried installing this new one. Two problems I had were: (1) the ribbon/cable that is supposed to plug into the iPod seems to be either too short or comes off the battery in an awkward spot, so that it doesn't easily reach the receptacle it needs to be plugged into; and (2) the clip/plug itself doesn't readily plug into the iPod. The plug end of the ribbon/cable seems to be just a bit too wide, and it is not stiff enough to snap cleanly into place. It was literally like trying to push on a piece of string.At any rate, I was frustrated that I couldn't get it to work for me. It was still worth trying, to hopefully save the cost of buying a new iPod, but that's what I'm looking at having to do now."
1,Total Junk...don't purchase unless you want to buy a new iPod.,"The tools that came with the battery were useless...after my husband spent over an hour trying to pry the case apart with our own tools, he completely broke my ipod. Now, my iPod screen won't display on the upper half, and the case couldn't be put back together. You're better off buying an external battery or simply replacing the iPod...that's what I ended up having to do!"
5,Worked Great!,Was easy to install (you can also find plenty of youtube videos for instructions) and my iPod is like new. Apple store wanted $75 to do it.
2,"Terrible battery life, again...","This is the second time I've replaced my iPods battery with this brand, and once again it holds a charge for about 4-5 hours... Still better than going through apple and losing all your music and paying way too much!"
1,Garbage,The battery won't charge after I installed it. I put my iPod into diagnostic mode and the battery isn't taking the charge. I put my old battery in and it works better. I'm still in need of a good battery for my iPod. If you feel like it I would love to have one of yours that works.
2,450mAh not 550mAh,"On the product description, the battery is said to be 550mAh, but when I got the item, its label says ""450mAh"", which is a lower level."
4,My iPod is back in business!,Opened it. Installed it. My iPod is functioning like the day I bought it. No problems so far with the battery!
1,Sadly junk,"This is the second type of this battery that I have purchased. The battery charges, but does not hold its charge in idle for more than a few hours. Plays for 4-5 hours but only immediately after a charge. For some reason the battery continues to lose charge as if it is being used at full load, even if I turn the Ipod off."
3,"Not the best, but better than what I had.","My ipod was completely dead, and would not charge. This was an inexpensive way to bring old girl back to life.I was working with a 5th gen iPod.The instructions, though printed in the tiniest font possible, were good enough for me to complete the task. The tools were handy, and enabled me to get the casing off without scratching it. I found the best method was to find an easy spot to wedge the tool in, and then work my way down the side.The battery doesn't have great life. Less than an hour from a charge. However, for me, that was sufficient. I leave it in my car or at my desk, so just having it power up and stay somewhat charged is a benefit for me."
4,Excellent Value For Your Money,"This battery comes with all the tools you will need to do the replacement yourself, however it has no instructions at all, so I highly reccomend watching several videos on the subject before you attempt to try it.Mainly because disassembling the iPod is harder than the videos make it seem, and the plastic tools that come bundled are really fragile, so in the end you will probably end with both of them broken; After you open up the iPod everything else can be done easily and smoothly, and the battery lasts as long as an OEM one.This is an excellent value for your money."
2,False representation of product = cheating the customer,"Specifications as listed on amazon.com website clearly state it is a 550mAh battery. However, the label on the battery received specifies it as a 450 mAh battery. That is almost a 20% decrease in battery capacity, and I haven't even used it yet! Imagine paying for 10 gallons of gasoline, and only receiving 8 gallons - the customer gets cheated. Should have read the reviews, but since the item was coming directly from Amazon, I trusted them to uphold their end of the bargain, and ship the stated product."
4,Works,It works just as it should. Be sure to go online and look up the instructions to install with pictures and it will be a breeze. Why 4 stars? Because it does not come with a clear set of instructions.
1,Batteries didn't work at all,I installed batteries according to directions and both batteries did not work even when fully charged. What a rip off.
1,worst purchase at Amazon,"Installation was easy. Charged and worked fine at first. HOWEVER, stopped working (can't chage at all) after 2months. ONLY 2months! Claim return to the seller. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL."
1,Would not charge,"After I installed it, the new battery would not charge. I put my old one back in and it charged, although the charge didn't last long, which is why I replaced it."
2,Not as advertised,"The technical details listed this battery as 550 mAh, but the item shipped to me was only 450 mAh. This misinformation is unacceptable.The only reason it received higher than one star is that it has worked very well since installation."
4,Gitzo Basalt Tripod an Excellent Choice,"I bought this tripod because I was looking for as light-weight a tripod possible that still had strength to hold equipment solidly. I settled on this and while it's not as light as a truly portable tripod is, it's certainly lightweight for a solid, dependable performer. I need to get a new head for it that also is lighter weight [unfortunately, just had to reuse the 'old' head I had and didn't save much in weight because of that.] In any event, it's a fine tripod and solidly built. I bought the 4 section one because I wanted to be able to break it down as small as possible for ease of transport, and that helps quite a bit. [The 4 star is a high rating from me, as I rarely give anything the top rating; perhaps after more use and with a newer, lighter head, I'd move it up.]"
5,awesome,"Great advice with a concrete, specific action plan that is doable and not overwhelming. Simple, straightforward approach, and easy to understand, process, and implement. Plus, engaging to watch, excellent graphics, high production values, and pretty colors! Woo hoo! Distills some of the best advice from the books that are out there - and just the way we ADDers like it, cuts it all down to the essentials. Super basic stuff that can change your life if you do it, and you CAN do it. Wish I'd had this information when I got my diagnosis."
5,Very Creative,"I read this book and was overpowered by the intensity of the writting. As a reader I was taken into this world and am in utter amazment at the possibilites of fantsy and fiction they have created. There was obviously a mass amount of time put into this creative peice of work. I would HIGHLY recomend this to anyone who enjoys fiction, fansty or reading at all. I hope there will be more books to come!"
1,Yuck yuck yuckkky,This book was such trash. I started reading it thinking it was a romance with a little drama. I never expected it to have incest in it. I work in a public library and I never recommend this book and if I see anyone with it I persuade them to not check it out.Pure garbage!!!!To bad for the author.I gave this book one star because I couldn't go any lower!!!
5,Magdalena to Mongolia Steve writes and shoots well,"I first met Steve when he came to give a wonderful presentation on Mongolia to our Navajo schoolchildren in Pinon,AZ. Pinon is in the middle of nowhere, no hotel, no place to eat, but I really wanted him to talk with our kids...he came trekking out with his falcon, wonderful dogs and his ever loving, patient, sweet wife! he was a hit! We distributed this great book to our community and they all came out - he signed books, ate and drank with us - it was wonderful! I got to hear many of these stories in detail - if you are a teacher - have him come to your class - well worth the time! Great read - even better in person - and can shoot a shotgun almost as well as ?"
2,A bad turn for the wheel of fortune,"These are not the original recordings. The fine backup usually provided by Columbia Studios for Laine's recordings is missing. Let me assure you the Woman in Love is not doing it with the Moonlight Gambler. I know because I collected them the hard way, one 45 rpm at a time."
5,Should have a higher than 5 star rating,"This is one EXCELLENT piece of work. Frankie was one of the greats, and this CD prooves it. If you love GOOD MUSIC, then this CD is a MUST for you. Although it is almost 57 minutes long, it seems to be over too quickly. (You just want more). EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,sounds disappointing,"I did get to hear an excerpt online of Mule Train and must concur in the disappointment I have seen from 2 other people in not getting the original recordings. Also, where is Carry Me Back to Old Virginney? I have just done a by-ear arrangement of it on my PC, and it will be going from there to a web site when the chance arises."
3,Great Game....Great Price.,This game far exceeded my expectations and It has kept me entertained for hours at a time. Highly recommended..
3,Not what I thought it would be,"Compared to the other fishing titles I have played, this one is so-so..not the best. The graphics are very nice though and the bass look almost real which is cool. My beef is that you can only troll the boat (not drive the boat), you have no reel, rod, or line options, and not enough lure selection which is extremely limited IMO. If you are ok with those things, then you will probably like it. But if you are like me, then you will wish you would have saved your money for something else instead."
1,Horrible,"This book talks about how to be a snobby brat and refers to that as being a princess. I can't believe the author was able to get away with calling this a children book. According to the book, you are a princess if you are mean to the nice kid and have boys flocking to your very desire."
2,"Imagine you are a ""Snooty"" Princess","It starts off saying a princess is someone who is married to a prince. This book suggest things of a princess that are not realistic or lady like. I was shocked that the book would suggest a dating agency for princesses and dropping a handkerchief intended for a prince to pick up. I would not allow any girl under the age 10 to read this book. However, it follows some other typical princess books and has a few good points. I would label this a comedy book for older ""snooty"" girls possibly pre-teen to teen."
3,OK,"Book was in excellent condition when we received it, like brand new. It had more about problems in it than perfect phrases. I wanted lots of examples of phrases. It wasn't what I expected."
5,A Must-Have For Your Leadership Library,"Anne Bruce does it again! This is a book every leader, at all levels, should be using!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Our son caught us by surprise and showed up a month early. Having other big items to purchase, we opted to by this glider/ottoman combo because of the price. Now just a short 2 1/2 months later, the glider is falling apart with normal daily use. Both arms are coming off and the chair has developed an annoying squeak. My husband tried to fix the arms but they came apart again. Now instead of saving money, we are going to have to purchase a new glider. Word to the wise, bite the bullet and spend the extra $50 - $100 to get a better quality glider that will last longer than 2 months."
5,One of the Best Albums of Its Era,"""Straight Up"" may be one of the most underrated albums in rock. From FM radio classics ""Baby Blue"" and ""Day After Day,"" to the haunting gem ""Name of the Game,"" this is British power pop at its best. There's not a bad song on the disc, and the production talents of George Harrison and Todd Rundgren bring out the best of the band's sound. Pick up a ""greatest hits"" package if you must, but ""Straight Up"" is essential listening for any fan of Badfinger, '70s power pop, or British rock. A masterpiece!"
5,NOTHING BAD HERE,"When I think of Badfinger I think of passion. For all it's perfect production qualities, Todd Rundgren and George Harrison could not drown out the passion of Straight Up. From beginning to end, the heart, soul & passion of this masterpiece comes through. Yes the sound is hauntingly Beatlesque. But there is so much more depth here that it would be a shame to place Straight Up in that Beatles box.Badfinger was behind the eight ball from it's inception. Being compared to the greatest rock band of all time can only finish in tradgedy. If you sound too much like them, you loose. If you sound similar to them you can never come out from under their immense shadow and thus are never given any credit for originality.Straight up is a great record. Badfinger could have been a great band, had they been given half the chance to let it be."
5,a true classic,"Definitely a five star album. Todd Rundgren and George Harrison did a masterful job producing this band. It's amazing to me that the sound is so seamless when two different producers were involved. The extra tracks on No Dice show that, when the band was given more say in the studio, they sounded much more like a pedestrian rock band. Rundgren and Harrison gave them more of a pop sheen and turned songs like Day After Day, Suitcase, Sometimes, Take It All, Perfection, etc. into classics that sound as good today as they did in 1972. Evans may not have been McCartney as a bass player (and Gibbins certainly wasn't Ringo) but the overall sound was very effective and let the songs and vocals shine. There is not a weak song on the album."
5,1972 Again!,"For over twenty years I had a battered, scratched vinyl album of STRAIGHT UP. It was becoming almost unlistenable when finally I found it on CD. I let out such a whoop of delight at finding a long lost friend! STRAIGHT UP is my all-time favorite album. The alternate versions of several songs are an added pleasure."
2,Overpriced and small,This Lego is pretty small and I have since found out I paid too much for it. Would recommend paying more and buying the larger AT-ST.
5,Playing guitar,"The book an CD are very good. However, it would be marvelous to have a CD with a 20% slower version of the peices in order to facilitate practice."
4,"Easy to Read, Satisfying Story","This book is a very quick read. It contains some interesting stories. The comments of Grissom's sons, brothers, parents, and childhood friends shed some light on his true personality. The book does not dwell on Grissom's two spaceflights and death during a test. Instead, the narration focuses on his life journey to those public milestones."
3,Metabo Fat Burner Review,"Hi, before purchasing this product I would have liked to know how well it worked, because frankly I haven't seen any results. I do appreciate it being delivered during the period of time it was said it would be."
5,"MetaboFatBurner for Weight Loss, Appetite and Fat Burning","This mix of vitamins, minerals and herbs is one of the best mixes around for the price for appetite and fat burning. My whole family uses it. My 21 y.o. son borrowed my bottle and began losing bodyfat for body-building training with the lipotropics in it and that and the guarana helps with appetite also. I lost 42 lbs. of fat and this was one of the staple products I use daily to maintain fat burning, metabolism and control appetite and my husband has cut back on his eating with the vitamins in this helping him with his weight and energy levels so it is a great product for our family."
1,Fat Burner disaster,Did not increase my metabolism nor did I lose 1 pound and I took all 60 pills. It was a waist
2,results speak,"No success at all, but I will keep trying. Maybe I am doing something wrong or eating to much, I don't know?"
1,doesn't work,i have taken things like this before and they worked great. unfortunately this did nothing for me. i did everything that i usually did and did not see any results and felt no extra energy.
2,Not What I Expected,I bought this item in hopes of it boosting my metabolism and helping me lose weight quicker. All it did was give me a little energy boost when I took it. It does not help you lose weight! I work out twice a day and changed my diet while taking this and I didn't lose a single pound!! I do not recommend this.
5,Close to perfect!!,Futurepop/Trance and now Syrian adds in elements of Industrial crunch guitar on a few songs. This is about as good as it gets for me!! I only have one problem with this CD. It was too short. I want more songs!!
3,More music for the masses,"Before buying this, I skipped through the tracks at a listening station in the store, and thought ""this sounds pretty cool!"". But once I sat down and really listened, it's not as cool as I thought.This album is a blend of futurepop/ebm and Joe Satriani. I swear, Joe Satriani has been polymorphed into this music. The lyrics about sun, moon and stars in almost every song gets old too.I'll give it a 3 for Supernova, and tricking me into buying the damn thing."
4,Excellent book on action,"The fourth book in this series dedicates it time to showing action and battle moves. It starts off with a small section on motion and the human bone and muscle system, then moves into detail on action moves such as running and walking from many different angles. The bulk of this book is on battle moves, and they have a ton to show you. Everything from chops and punches to roundhouses and elbow strikes is right in this book from many different angles. The only reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is because I really think they could have gone into more detail on the muscle systems, and there are no weapons in this book. Although they show it on the cover, they don't show how to animate your characters with weapons. A small downside, but it still is a great book to learn many different types of action especially battle moves."
1,Ugh!,"When I first got this book it looked like it would help me with martial arts and japanese moves. Boy was I wrong. The very fact that this is japanese animation would make the reader ASSUME this was japanese Battling. Instead, I got HUGE Bozos, throwing punches and absolutely no martial arts. In this book, Tadashi was so busy showing the angles of just one kick, that he has absolutely NO variety WHATSOEVER! I'm serious, just one move takes him up to four pages to get his point across. Do yourself a favor and skip Volume 4 MASTERING BATTLE AND ACTION MOVES in Tadashi's work."
4,an axiomatic book,"this is an interesting book. the approach is axiomatic. it seems to lack physical motivation though. it helps if you are familiar with witten's original paper on tqft. otherwise, you might think that it is all abstract nonsense. in fact, the author himself said that the axioms of tqft might seem to be abstract nonsense, but it is powerful and rigorous.chern-simon, witten, and cft approach is not in this book."
1,Broke After Just 5 Months,"I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with this item. When I bought this phone, it had a 4-5 star rating from several different people.When I first got the phone/answering machine, I thought it was a great deal, but then I started to use it, I realized that it had some problems, like the volume couldn't be adjusted so it sounded like the person on the other line had a bad reception. After several of these calls, I realized it was this phone that had the bad reception.Now, after just 5 months, the phone doesn't even work. It rings, but when you push the TALK button, there is silence. I can't even make outbound calls anymore. PLEASE save yourself some money, and avoid buying this phone."
2,Poor quality sound,The sound quality of this phone is very poor. It fades and is fuzzy and uneven. The tone of the ringer is also annoying.
1,The Phone Broke After 4 Months,"I completely support the reviews of people below. It has got to be some kind of a common problem with this phone. The ""Talk"" button stopped working several months after the purchase. Save your bucks. Buy smth. good instead. I gave it 1 star just for working for 4 months."
2,Out of date,"I'm finding bits and pieces helpful, but did not bother to check the copyright date. This book is almost 25 years old. Language changes very fast, and I've lost confidence in this guide."
3,Keep dreaming!,"Anyone who thinks they can converse (at any level)in a new language in 7 days with the aide of a book is probably getting visits from Santa Claus. Although the book may be useful and a good reference,the title and its claim classify this as fiction."
3,Not the best,"Very easy to put together, looks great, glides very easily but isnt the most comfortable of gliders. I guess it comes down to what your budget is but if you can stretch it a little further, get a more expensive one. If you are a large person, and hey, who isnt when they are pregnant, it is very cosy when you sit in the chair. Feels like you are locked in."
1,just don't do it,12 months later.. it's broken.. and I am heart broken.. same problem other people mentioned.. the back and arms are falling off.. I loved this chair and I paid a whole lot more than $150 for it :( don't waste your money.. buy something better qualityby the way I am only 124lbs and only have a young baby so it doesn't take much to wear it out
1,Glider Came Apart After Only 17 Months,"If I could give this glider less than one star, I would. The glider was fine while it lasted. Unfortunately, it lasted for only 17 months. One day, the back came off the base of the chair. I'm a petite woman with a 20-pound daughter, so I know the cause wasn't excessive wear and tear -- it was poor quality."
3,Have to wait and see,I just recieved this as a shower gift. It wasn't the one I asked for so I got onto this site to check it out. I am a little scared about the reviews so I reinforced it when I put it together. I added some wood glue inbetween each part that I put together and added 4 nails to the back and one in each arm rest at the bases. I am sure this will help make this chair last a while longer. Maybe this is something people should try if you get it as a gift or even to reinforce it if you have had it for a while already. Especially for those of us who have spent way to much on everything else to go out and buy a more expensive chair right now!
4,Good chair at the right price,This chair is a good chair for the right price. I wanted to buy one of those expensive reclining gliders but I just didn't have the budget for it since I have a baby on the way. This chair is nice looking and glides with very minimal effort. I read all of the reviews and some of the things people complained about it states in the warning label not to do those things. For example don't leave your child unattened in the chair because it could tip over if they are playing on it. It is not a $500 dollar chair but it was worth the $100 bucks that I spent on it.
1,"Cheap, Terrible Chair","We bought this rocker after we had our first baby and it seemed fine the first week. However, it started squeaking, creaking and grinding - LOUDLY. Also, if you run your hands along the ""wood"" it gives you little splinters. Not fun, especially when you have a baby around. This chair is poorly made and it shows. We returned it to Toys R Us and they gave us another chair (same model) - which is just as bad. Please save your money and buy another glider rocker."
3,"Glider is ""ok""","This glider seems to have decent construction, but the cushioning lacks. I noticed in the first couple of weeks home with my new baby that the cushion was flattening out and not reshaping very well. Obviously not a high quality foam...I guess you really have to spend well over $300 to get something that stays comfortable and still looks good.Other than that, I am satisfied. I am assuming that as we use it less and less it will reshape, but for now....it looks like it is a couple of years old instead of a couple of months."
4,"Very comfortable, easy gliding","I am very happy with this glider. I have had it for nearly one year and haven't had any problems with it. I use it for about an hour each day. It is very cosy. I fit in it well now, but when I was nine months pregnant and 30 pounds heavier, I was just able to squeeze between the arms. Once in the chair, it does not take much to glide back and forth. You can push off of the floor or with your feet on the ottoman. Either way is very comfortable. The fabric on the cushions isn't the softest, but I have a plush blanket thrown over the back to add to the nursery decor. When my son was young, he fit easily in my arms and I used the chair arms for support while holding him. Now that he's older, he nestles comfortably in my lap for relaxing gliding. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,Broken in less than a year,"Cheaper isn't always better. This glider was fine until it broke in less than a year. I weigh 140lbs and use it 20 minutes a day, it should be able to last longer than 11 months!!!!"
1,Structural FAILURE,"First, at 12 months, we thought the screws stripped, but actually the metal in the locking nut failed. It sheared in half. So we bought two more bolts and fixed it. Now the wood piece in the back of the seat part, that holds the back to the base broke lengthwise in half.I called Jardine Enterprises numerous times and never received a response. This chair and ottoman are now 300 dollars worth of rubbish. I'm furious I paid so much for barely a year worth of chair. If I have another child, I'll have to buy a new glider. This only lasted for one baby."
2,It's ok.... for a short period of time!,"I recieved this chair and ottoman combo as a baby shower gift. I loved it, that is until it fell apart. I'm only 5'2"" and 140lbs. I used it when I fed my now 6 month old son and to rock him to sleep. It started to make this rubbing noise and then the chair just fell apart. As I was rocking the metal parts that make it glide started to shave themselves smooth and they just slid out of their gooves. When that happened, thank god I wasn't holding my son at the time, the chair basically collapsed inward on me. I'm alright, but trust me spend the extra money and go buy a good quality Amish made glider. Thats what I did!"
3,NOT COMFY,"My daughter is a squirmer, and she was always arching her back and hitting her head on the wood on the arms. Plus for my back it isn't cushioned enough. It does squeek and I am not a big person. It also tips very easily when I just lay some clothing over the back. I gave it 3 stars becasue it was cheap. But for my next baby I am investing in something else. You are worth it."
2,You get what you pay for,"When shopping around for a glider during my first pregnancy I didn't want to spend the price for one of those expensive gliders. This one seemed not only affordable, but comfortable. After using the glider everyday for a year and a half it's easy to see that you get what you pay for. Now as my due date approaches for my second I'm in the process of looking for replacement cushions. The cushions have become flat, pilled, and very uncomfortable. I wish I had spent the money the first time around."
2,squeaks bad,"This chair worked out great for the first few months. But since then, it squeaks very bad. I have tried WD-40 several times the that works for about 3-5 days till the squeaking comes back. Its very frustrating. I guess being only 100.00, you get what you pay for. :("
2,Ouch!,"This seat makes my back ache after about 10 minutes. The fabric also began to have snags in it the first day. For the price, I guess the product is okay. As for me, I have already ordered a different model and I can't wait until it gets here so we can replace this one."
4,Teen daydream story.,"Geared to the early reader, this story will appeal to those children who are interested in hot rods."
2,"Deborah, I think you need to talk to a professional","Let me sum up this book..White people, please say you are sorry for slavery..Please love me..Why don't you love me? I hate you for not loving me..This book is an excellent study on a common psychosis that has beset a large number of black people in this country. Though she is a successful writer, professor and commentator, her self-esteem weighted down by what ""white people"" think. She abdicates the fate and future of an entire race of people to ""white people"". They have enough problems of their own.The way Deborah tells it, I need to be watching over my shoulder for white people every second. I think she is living in the movie ""I know what you did last summer"".Are there any black writers with some good news? On a positive note, she writes well. If you are white and she her around, please give her hug for me."
4,Of course it's for beginners,"This book is indeed for beginners - it's Java programming for linguists, not linguistics for Java programmers! It is an introduction to Java programming for people who are mainly interested in corpus linguistics and text processing rather than, say, web applets or business programming. And I think it does a decent job. So does the companion volume for Perl. I only wish there were a Python edition in the series."
2,"Simple, but just too simple.","As the title of the book says, ""Programming for Linguistis"". The author assumes that most linguists don't have any programming experience and may not have to write a complicate program, the content is therefore very simple. However, it is just somehow too simple. Sometimes we still have to use a complex function in a easy program, whose explanation is skipped. For example, the author never explains why ""-1"" in ""line.indexOF(word) > -1"" means a word in anywhere in a line . Examples like this make people confused and cause more and more problems as learners go deeper and deeper. I believe as a linguist, we may only have write a small program sometimes, but we don't have to be an expert of Java doesn't mean that we don't have to understand it clearly. I still suggest that if you are a linguist and want to learn Java, you have to choose other Java books which is written in a clear way and then find useful examples for linguists such as searching in a text in this book."
4,One of their best....,"These guys were just under appreciated!!!!!! What a shame. So much good music that was never heard (Scotland's Deacon Blue was another way under appreciated band). Lake picks up with Lake 2 where they left off with their first album, and carries on with it in Ouch! (my personal favourite Lake album). I'm glad to see that their music has been make available on CD."
5,"Wonderful, I love her music",She is mind blowing. Her voice is like fine wine. she is truly blessed to have a voice like that.
5,Lalah Hathaway,"I feel in love with this cd the moment I heard it. She is one of the best unknown talents around. I'm a radio DJ and whenever I play ""Heaven Knows"" people call in and ask if she's a new singer. I tell them ""nope, she's been around for awhile"" Favorite cuts: Stay Home Tonight, I'm Coming Back, Baby, Don't Cry and of course Heaven Knows. I heard she recently sign with a record company, if so I can't wait for her new album. If you don't own this one, you're truly missing a royal treat!!!!!"
5,It is Somethin'!!,"I saw Lalah live a couple of months ago for the second time. The difference was, I was only a few feet away from her and the stage. What makes a great singer is her ability to make songs flow effortlessly. It's the reason us mere non-singers/fans think we can do it in the mirror utilizing a comb, brush or pencil as a microphone. Lalah's approaches to these songs is done with such authority, confidence and sophistication; but not so out of reach that her sound is too haughty. It's honest, hungry, deep, seductive and lush. I don't have her newest cd, but this one is one I can vouch for and it has a dear place in my must have music list. She evokes a similiar tone and approach to her father, yet she remains true to her own voice. The production is tight and almost every cut is perfect! ""Your Smile"" is my favorite cut. The lyrical content, music and production represent the best of what good music should be."
3,Wonderful Debut,"I bought this as an LP when it was released umpteen years ago and as I listen to it today, I remember why I loved it so much then and why I love it now...ol girl can sing! She sounds so much like her dad, but with her own flavor. I believe Baby Don't Cry was the break-out hit, but Smile is the absolute best cut on this CD. I'm Coming Back and I Gotta Move On are also outstanding tracks. Stay Home Tonight, Somethin' and Heaven Knows deserve a mention, as well. Despite the three filler tracks, as a whole, this was a great debut for an artist who, coming out of the gate, was undoubtedly going to be compared to her father, but has sucessfully carved her niche in the music world as her later discs have shown. It's unfortunate that she doesn't get the praise she deserves."
4,A old mold but a great toy.,"This Battle Droid is..okay. It's based on the battle arena Battle Droid mold and has 5 points of articulation, very nice details, and a blaster that fits snugly in its hands. Despite what most people say its head DOES NOT come off. The Battle Droid's head fits nice and tight and turns 360 degrees. This figure is a great buy if you are looking to build a droid army. However if you are looking for a better droid that is new and cooler buy two of General Greavious bodyguards(and the 'though not a droid' Clone Commander)."
2,Trouble standing up...,"This version of the Battle Droid has very weak legs. As mentioned in other reviews, prop this dude up against something if you take it out of the package to play with it as the plastic legs are so thin they have a difficult time supporting the weight of the figure and the legs will bend sideways (at the knees). Unfortunately, the Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) Super Battle Droid figure suffers from the same design problems."
2,"Poor quality, low detail","Head comes off easily. Droid sits on my desk but if it falls over the head will come off. I'll be using super glue soon.Doesn't hold it's gun properly. It doesn't ""click"" in place or anything like that. On top of that, the arms/hands are not rotated correctly to hold the gun (as shown on picture). So when the plastic starts rotating back in its original place, the gun pops out. Again, I'll get out the super glue to fix that.Detail is very low, cheap product. Not sure on durability, but I would think not too good for kids to play with."
2,Keep it in the package or don't buy it,"The only thing this figure has going for it is that it looks cool. I bought this figure for my son and before I could get it out of the package the head came off. It's easy to snap back on but the way it was designed it's also easy to come off so I ended up super glueing the head on. Then the gun or ""laser"" as we call them here at home keeps falling out of it's hands because the ""fingers"" don't grasp very well. So when ever he plays with it I hear ""daddy can you fix this"" until he gets tired of asking me. Spend the ca$h on a different figure like the Revenge of the Sith Clone Trooper. A lot better figure for the same money"
3,Not So Good at Battle Droid,These battle-droids look about as threatening as cel-phones and fight about as well in the movies.
4,WRONG AUTHOR!!!,"This is the book by MICHAEL Lynch (I checked the ISBN). I don't know why AMAZON has it listed the wrong way.But it's a very good and useful text, accurate and well-researched."
4,Good replacement for Lego's motor,"This is a good replacement for the Lego's motor for their boat line which they no longer make. Lego's wants over $20 where you can have this one for under half. Very good deal. Also works for old vintage 12"" G.I. Joe sea sleds which used a similar motor."
3,Doesn't have enough power,"Not powerful enough. I thought the little motor would provide more power, it barely seems to move a toy boat along"
4,Its a good movie,"The films narrative is greatly shown and I do think is very original, it is not easy to understand but why do you have to understand everything always. The questions that the film arise are great ,as Bergman would have said ""I have the impression that the questions are more important than the answers. I do recommend this movie its worth every dollar."
3,Blue Wave High-powered Subwoofer,"The product was good; needs xmax though, and a few more details inorder to build a good box. Good bass though. I would recomened not spending the money on this sub, but going to JBL. For only $30 to 50 more, you can get a lot more quality."
1,Speakers suck,I had the speakers for 24hrs and they blew they are worthless they really suck DO NOT BUY piece of junk
1,Not as great...,The speaker barely works once its in the car had to buy a new one because the audio store refused to hook it up bought is as a gift worse one ever
5,Kicking Speakers,"I used these to replace 15"" midbass woofers in a PA system. They have really deep tones and pound hard, I would imagine in a car sub box these speakers would pound really hard. They def are worth the money."
1,Not A Happy Camper....,"I did the big chop with My hair (African American) and this product dried My hair out. I am also trying to gain growth around My temples and this stuff took My hair out in that area even more. Now I am really hating the big chop.This may work well for some but its the opposite for Me. I have a big jar and have to throw it out or find someone to give it to. I am so pissed right now. Now I have to start all over again trying to grow My edges out again. Now I am contemplating a wig but hoping that tomorrow when I wet My hair and gel it up it won't look bad (doubt it). Really upset now.All this damn hard work I am putting into growing out My hair correctly, and treating it with this stuff made all that effort pointless. Back to the drawing board.Not happy,"
4,Nice drama,If you like happy uncomplicated endings then this may not appeal to you so much. 3 1/2 stars is what I should have given this movie. This movie was made in a cost effective way and it shows.
2,Liked it until it broke on the 3rd day,"I work part time at an auto shop doing primarily tire changes so I wanted a good sturdy core removal tool. I bought this and for the the three days I used it, I loved it. I loved it until I attempted to remove a valve core that was somewhat stuck and one of the stems on the removal tool busted right off (I did not even apply that much strength. Very disappointing. I will not buy again."
3,Enjoyable game play but inaccurate portrayal...,"When I purchased this game I had really high expectations for it, being a Tolkien fan and all. I was quickly disappointed when about 30 minutes into the game, I realized that the storyline is completely askew to the actual story of The Hobbit. The game has really good graphics and is fun to play, but the overall ""quests"" they send you on in the game, are somewhat dull at times. I understand that trying to adapt the book into a video game must be quite a feat to accomplish, but I would expect better. I obviously expected too much."
5,Way better than I thought it was going to be.,"The Hobbit is the amazing prude to the Lord of the Rings. When I first weard they were making a prude I thought this was going to be bad. Then more info came out and it looked wonderful. The final pruduct looks great. It's about Frodo uncle Bilbo, and how a wizard named Gandalf sent him out to destroy a Dragon named ""Smuag"". It also talks about how Bilbo got the one ring for Gollum. The game is alot like Zelda. Very fun and will ansewer some qustions."
1,I!@$#%^&*!@#!#A$!%$^%$!%$^F C^!%&@*&!,"I have not played the game, but looking at the cooooooooool graphics and zelda type gameplay reminds me of chicken noodle soup.(yum, chicken noodle soup, yumy yumy yuuuuuuuuuuum)"
4,"Everlasting and Entertaining, but no LOTR","Although a little childish, a good game. Easy enough that you can always pick it up and advance a little further, and it seems to just go on forever. Each level is dramatically different, and there are plently of puzzles even for the experienced gamer. I would definitely try it out if you are a Tolkien fan. Granted, theres not alot of sword play, but its The Hobbit, what do you expect."
4,"Not Bad, overall enjoyable.","The gameplay is simple enough to learn, and if you like puzzle/action games then it's perfect for you. The storyline doesn't exactly follow the book, with some parts being completely made up. If you don't mind those differences, though, then this game should provide you with plenty of entertainment. Rated E for everyone, younger players should be able to enjoy it, but it can also be fairly challenging."
4,A Must Own,"I have just finished this game recently. I spent 7 hours finising from where I was. I was hooked!!! Any game that makes you want to continue playing until your done is worth the money.I do have one problem though. I'm an adventurer. In other words, I'll investigate every nook and cranny of the game to find all of the jewels, or secrets. Problem was in the level called ""Inside Information"" I made the mistake of finding a Spear, Ruby, Shield, Necklace. Then when I completed that level, and onto the next level, I was asked by some of the dwarves to retrieve these items. Well, when I went back to those places. Guess what, they were gone and they didn't show in my inventory that I received them!!! So, I was unable to fulfill those missions. It's a shame too, no I'll never know what I would've received as a reward!! There is nothing you can do. This is a flaw in the game not in the player. Other than that, I give it 4 stars!!!"
2,another poorly made SS dvd . . .,"Buyer beware, the quality control on this and other strawberry shortcke dvd's is questionable. My daughters own all of the SS dvd's and at least half of them freeze up and shake, no matter what TV or dvd player it's on. Very frustrating, and disappointing for little ones. The stories are cute, just be aware of the return & exhange policy in case of this and other SS dvd items don't work correctly."
3,One great story...one fair,"My 3.5 year old daughter LOVES everything to do with Strawberry Shortcake and princesses so I thought she would flip over this DVD. Indeed, she loves the first story on this DVD which is a take-off on the Cinderella story. We've watched it like 10 times already. However, she is less interested in the Peppermint Fizz story about not liking Rainbow Sherbet because she's ""not like me."" It does have a message that people can be different and still be friends...but this part of the DVD doesn't appeal to my daughter quite as much. She just wants to watch the princess part over again. So a mixed review for us on this one!"
2,Buyer Beware!!,"We got about 5 minutes into the video when my 4 year old started crying, it had frozen, wouldn't work at all. We returned one, got a new one, it freezes too! We have almost all the Strawberry Shortcake DVD's, and this is the ONLY one we have had a problem with, and the story looks so cute. I think the mass production on this one really got screwed up and I caution buyers to beware."
1,Too mean for my little girl!,"My goodness! My toddler is in love w/ her Strawberry Shortcake books and I rented this from the library becasue I thought she'd love it. Well, she does, but I HATED it!I can't stand the almost anime look, but mostly was horrified by the substance. In one early scene, Orange Blossom and Gingersnap are arguing over a dress to wear to the ball. They're the wicked step-sisters in this ""Cinderella"" episode. They are obnoxious and bratty and there is no positive or correcting counterbalance to their nastiness. Lo-and-behold, I overheard my daughter re-enacting the scene w/ her dollhouse people about an hour later.That DVD is going back to the library tomorrow! I'll stick to the books where I can determine the tone of voice used."
4,excellent and informative.,"This book seems more like the old ""Good Fats/Bad Fats"" by Erasmus. Thank you Rosemary for sharing a very informative book on nutrition."
1,Way Behind the Times,"If you want a dvd to show you 'HOW NOT TO TRAIN A HORSE' then buy this dvd. A horse whisperer????? I think not. I was disgusted watching his methods. Randy needs to get with the times. There are much better ways to train a horse. Check with the pros like John Lyons, Pat Parelli, Stacey Westfall, Karen Scholl just to name a few. Their methods are way better."
2,Format is Lovely - Content is Meager,"The format is well organized, and full page color photography is nice - especially with the addition of captions highlighting elements of the rooms. Very nice touch is the back of the book, containing removable swatches and a pocket for swatches you collect.But, six pages for wallpaper and nary a Bradbury & Bradbury design in sight? Bathrooms - one picture in the entire book? Two sections on home offices - including one with a fireplace and a warming oven (I thought this was a decorating workbook based in the real world?) Where in heck are you supposed to incorporate the computer equipment?Not enough content for the person just getting familiar with Arts & Crafts. Not emough content for the person (like me) planning a renovation of my 1920's bungalow. I'm not sure who this book is aimed at. Very disappointing."
5,Useful Concept within its Specified Scope,"This is not a textbook nor a guide to its history or sources. It makes none of these claims. What it claims it succeeds in doing for us: A Workbook for Arts and Crafts lovers or beginners.We've found that going through books and magazines to find stuff we like in decorating in A&C style is what this great resource provides in neat, organized way!Great idea starter easy to carry when shopping. Who wants to carry a heavy stack of books with far too many words and few illustrations, except of rooms?This is more easily accessible for most of us shoppers. We've already used it for art, chairs and found it very resourceful and helpful.If you're an expert, maybe this has no place. For the consumer that we are, this is great! Depending on your needs and goals, this just might fit well in your A&C library like it has in ours."
2,"A disappointing book, however brilliant.","Often, I've sat reading this book in bookstores across Boston, hoping for it to change its ways. It's brilliantly organized and the pictures are great, but the knowledge behind the framework and fandango is either absolutely lacking or off for a lunchbreak. The author totally ignores the differences between the English and American A&C aesthetics, which, if you are already familiar with the differences, might not make much difference, but if you are a newbie to the A&C Renaissance, will be hugely misleading. The architectural poetics espoused by Morris and Voysey are quite different from those of Stickley, Wright, and the Roycroft community. I would have expected much better from this author."
2,Worst Book On A&C,"This book is really a travesty. The captions to the very nice photos were full of errors and were clearly written by someone who had not a clue as to what was in the photo. Save your money. There are so many excellent books on the subject, nearly any one of which is vastly superior to this laughable ""book"" on the Arts & Crafts Movement."
1,Not what I expected,"Not quite the book I was looking for. I thought the book would help me create an ""Arts & Crafts"" decorating style to my home. It did not offer much direction."
5,"A wonderful, unfortunately short lived comic","Bliss has already come and gone, but hopefully the sequel to this book will also be forthcoming.The strip was an absolute riot; Stephen has a sharp incisive wit. Almost every strip is phrased just so precisely, yet so familiar to those going through the wedded ups and downs of middle class.A definite must buy if you like comic strips such as Adam, Stone Soup, or For Better or For Worse."
2,Close but no cigar.,It's almost there. Personaly I'd like to be able to store the ZIP disks __with__ their boxes.I'm still looking for something better though.
3,Not that bad but no easy primer.,"What I expected was a self-teaching guide that gradually exposes the user to statistical theory. What I got was the standard deviation formula on page 24 and it got deeper and deeper (these are very short pages with ample white space.) The writing isn't bad but the usage of Greek symbols is a bit overwhelming and unnecessary in this day in age. I thought the notations and formulas using popular spreadsheet programs helpful and would have like to seen more of it. After all business people rarely use binomial probability tables when you can get the answer in a spreadsheet table faster. I felt that this is not really a self-teaching guide for someone like myself, the last time I had any math was in high school algebra. Also, I could have used more work problems.Overall not bad but not for the novice."
3,good first effort from a very young writer,"When judged against Gone With The Wind, this book (really more of a short story) fares badly, but you have to keep in mind the youth and inexperience of the author. I found the plot trite, the main character more annoying than inspiring, and the ending unbelievable. And yes, there's an obvious racist slant. If the story weren't written by Margaret Mitchell, I doubt it would ever have seen the light of day. However, it's worth a read to see how even the best writers start with amateurish efforts. If nothing else, it shows aspiring writers that there's hope if they persevere. GWTW is a magnificant achievement, and this book can't take away from that."
4,New Glimpse Of Scarlett O'Hara's Creator,"If you're a GWTW fan, don't miss this love story! Lost Laysen is second fiddle to the real story in this offering: Margaret ""Peggy"" Mitchell's letters to Henry Love Angel. Their story fascinated me much more than the fiction she pinned as a teen. Her letters and the photos and the story of how they surfaced made me feel like the young ""Peggy"" defied time and was alive again. Peggy's Henry must have been very special!"
4,Intelligent overview,"This intelligent overview of attachment theory succeeds most when it integrates attachment theory with broader psychoanalytic understanding. Particularly helpful is its discussion of borderline personality disordered patients' ways of communicating, where attachment theory links up interestingly with contemporary Kleinian notions of projective identification."
1,Disappointing Read,This is a disappointing read. Half of the book is the reference material from the help files and the other half is random report design techniques that don't fit together. Give this one a pass.
4,excelent,I am using the book in my tables. It is my first time and I very please with it.The books is clear and has several eg. and explanations to put in practice. I can not say about the condition becaouse is a e-book. But the letter and print look good.
3,Not as helpful as I hoped.,The book seemed to be geared towards Crystal 9 and not Crystal XI. I had purchased XI at the same time. The book was not a large book and half of it contained an extensive glossary of terms. Very unneccessary as this information is found in many places.ThanksBonnie
5,UN LIBRO PARA ALGUIEN ESPECIAL EN LA COCINA,"En este libro encontrarás MENUS PARA TODO EL AÑO para todo tipo de eventos, te sacará de apuros BUENISIMO."
2,Takes too long for first issue to arrive,It takes between 10-12 weeks for the first magazine to arrive. I've ordered several other magazines that send the most recent issue as the first issue immediately. There should be some sort of option for this magazine as well.
2,LOVE THE SHOES BUT HATE THE PAIN,"I absolutely love the look of these shoes and I did receive lots of complements on them.However, the first day I wore them they hurt since there is no give or elasticity where the band goes across the top of toes so side of feet dug in.The back didn't seem to be a problem 'til the 2nd time I wore them and I ended up with a HUGE blister on my heel which I am still treating with neosporin and another blister on the toe area. I wish there had been more elasticity to them.These shoes cannot be broken in. They either feel good from the get go or not.The problem with this is they cannot be returned since they were worn so I gave them away to a friend visiting from out of state.If she ends up with the same results then nothing is lost on her part.Just thought you should know."
5,A welcome change for a textbook,"This is a fine example of how a good text can teach and still not put you to sleep. The concepts are illustrated clearly and with humor, and interesting case examples and excerpts are provided with each section. I'm a computer science major, and I still found this material quite interesting. While I can't say I think any better of sociology in general, I do know a lot more about it now that I've read this book."
3,Sociology concepts 5th edition,The book was in good condition would have been better if the pencil writing wasn't in the book or if it was mentioned forehand I would have known exactly what to expect... Other than that it was okay arrived on time as well.
3,School Book Reading,"If I didn't have to buy this for a class, I wouldn't have bought it. This stuff bores me! Sorry, but I'd rather watch my wife's fingernail polish dry! :-)"
5,Very happy with my transaction!!!,I was very pleased with this transaction. It arrived in a timely manner and was just what I had expected. Am recommending this vendor to all.
5,Best book about diabetes and best book about insulin resistance ever!,As a health care provider I have recommended this book to my patients! It is amazingly thorough and a recommended read for everyone diabetic or not. This has some of the best nutrition advice anywhere!
5,Received quickly and in great condition,"I was very happy that I received this book quickly because I'm concerned about my health. This book arrived in excellent condition and also in a large print that I was not expecting, I read the entire book as soon as I received it and plan to read it again and use it for a reference."
5,A LIFE SAVER,"I bought this book as a last result because I have type II diabetes. I was having difficulty controling my weight and knowing what to eat to maintain my blood sugar levels. I have started using Atkins book on diabetes and I now boasts how much it has empowered me. Now I can truly say that I can keep up with my four little granddaughters when they come to visit me. This book has made a big difference in my life. I wasn't surprised because after all, this is a book by Dr. Atkins. I highly recommend this book."
1,Co-author Dr. Vernon needs a new approach...,"...to dieting and to writing. As a previous reviewer alluded to, this book would have been much better had Dr. Atkins been able to finish himself. However, what we are left with is a co-author MD who's personality is as cold as ice; not to mention condescending and disrespectful. This shines through in the tone of the writing. Furthermore, how can we take diet advice from someone who is obese herself? There are plenty of other well-written low-carb diet books. Try another."
3,"""Languageless language...""","A quick descent from skilled mind-reading to bumbling - to being a normal person. A born-again experience for David Selig. Interesting journey - especially the contrast between his personal weakness with regard to his gift versus that of Tom Nyquist who's truly a monster with his own gift. I'd be more glad to have met David - but can certainly see where his clutching need to connect and inability to do so leave him so ofthen isolated. I bounced through several of the essays and letter-writing exercises - but when David speaks his experience most directly - his words are powerful expressions of how close we can be to each other and still be alone. And how terrified of oneself and silence a person can be: ""Silence will become my mother tongue."""
1,"Lame documentary, politically correct, bad filming...","With bad camera and light work, this felt like a high school film project. It might have been cute and worthwhile if this was done at a somewhat decent level, but it wasn't."
4,"Charming, but needed more focus","A 10-week program in New York City schools teaches ballroom dancing to 5th graders, imparting lessons about self-worth, respect, and etiquette. Some of the students go on to dance in a city-wide competition. This documantary focuses on the children of three schools as they prepare for the showdown. As many other reviewers have noted, the film would have benefitted from a finer focus on a smaller number of kids. This would have allowed us to see more of their personal lives and place the program in its context. Nervertheless, there are many joyful sequences in this film, and the children are charming. Those qualities go a long way."
5,Funny and charming,"Basically, Mad Hot Ballroom is about a group of NYC kids who are enrolled in a program that teaches them to ballroom dance. It's funny because the idea of these tiny urban kids learning to dance like proper adults is charming. It focuses on the weeks leading up to the big competition and the interaction between the instructors nad children and you just end up rooting for them all. It's a film about human emotion and it's so intriguing because you symphathize with these kids and just end up loving them.The thing that drives this documentary is the kids. Young kids are always charming and silly and the things they say will make you laugh and smile. Some are wise, some are goofy, and watching them is entertaining.The documentary does a good job of showing how this program has changed these kids."
5,Do you love dance?,I took ballroom dance classes at school when I was a kid. This movie reminds me of that time in my life. It also helps you realize some of the social challenges kids are still facing. Everyone should see it once.
4,Inner City Ballroom,"This Documentary was pretty good. I am saying this as my students right at the moment are dancing the Rumba in this very program. I think it was genius that Pierre Dulaine had the foresight to provide an opportunity for city school children to experience ballroom. The documentary is not very long and it takes you through the 1st class to competitions. While it is entertaining it doesn't delve into the children's lives but I'm not sure it was supposed to. As classroom teacher whose school participates in this program this movie is quite accurate. If your school has money to splurge, think of Dancing Classrooms. It's great!"
1,Mad Hot Ballroom,"A heart-warming documentary about post 911 NYC children and the fantastic school system and teachers who introduced them to the art of ballroom dancing. It provides insight to young children's hopes, dreams and struggles."
4,No violence. Very New York. Fun at the end,The film is a lot of fun and very enjoyable. You jump up off the couch.
5,"It's about the kids, but ""thanks"" go out to the teachers","While it's a bit disappointing that there are literally *no* extras on the DVD, it doesn't take anything away from the brilliance of Marilyn Agrelo's documentary ""Mad Hot Ballroom."" Although the kids are the stars here, Agrelo's camera pays respect to the efforts of teachers like Yomaira Reynoso, Rodney Lopez and Alex Tchassov who really seem to be in this for the kids, not for themselves (and, god knows, certainly not for the money). I think it's Ms. Reynoso who best expresses what's going on here - she says something along the lines of wanting to expose these nine- and ten-year-old kids to their creative sides to unlock whatever talent might be inside there. And, you can actually see that clicking in a couple of these kids. It's spine-tingling to watch that happening. As another teacher points out, you can see them maturing into young adults before your eyes."
2,Disappointed in the quality...,"I have bought Le Creuset pieces before and was disappointed to find out that they are manufactured in Thailand. I also was disappointed in the uneven quality of the glazing on them and most likely will not be buying anymore of their products.I have used these bowls twice now; once for onion soup another for chicken pot pie. The bowls performed okay in my oven and retained the heat quite well on both occasions but, I am still reluctant to buy another set of these bowls or any other Le Creuset product."
1,for believers only,"This book is meant for religionists, the superstitious, the believers in Satan, hell, and the doctrine of the total depravity of man, the credulous and believers of the pernicious lie that Christianity. and all other superstitious religions, have always been."
2,Tepid essays from Abbey wanna-be,"A collection of essays - part nature writing, part travelogue. While the intent of the writer is admirable, you can shelve this collection with other ""friends of Ed""; that is Ed Abbey, the master of this genre. Name dropping appears to be the focus of many of the essays.As far as the travel essays, this area has been covered better by others, though the essay on the relatively unknown Owyhee country was well done.Another note of irritation is Peterson's continuous railing of ""urban refugees"" sticking ""a dagger in the heart of the wilderness"". Yes, we would all love to be the only ones hiking up our favorite trail or to have a lonesome cabin at the end of a dirt road, but Peterson doesn't seem interested in any sharing of the wilderness."
1,unsuitable!!!,I had to read this novel for a childrens lit class. I was truly distrubed by this book! Even more disturbed that it is available for children to read. Making comments that concern satan influences and etc. truly does not belong in my child's library! I am sure the author is well-known for other books but this one is upsetting!
5,book,I am always looking for big books for my classroom. This big book is humorous and has perfect repeating of sounds.
3,Reprint of historical book with drawings,"George Wharton Edwards is known for his travel and historical books. He illustrated them himself with well-executed, elegantly-detailed drawings and paintings. The original books are very beautiful, especially for the plates, but it hard to find them in good shape. This is a reprint rather than an original, but if the subject matter interests one, it could be a good choice."
5,365 Prophetic Promises & Blessings for Your Children,"Do you want your children to receive the blessings of God? This is a book that all parents should take to heart if you what to bless your children. It is easy to read and use, the concept is simple just need 5 minutes or more depending on what you desire. You'll find out what a great difference your blessings really make in the lives of those you love most (your children). The bottom line is - you need to give time to expose spiritual matter in their lives instead of leaving God's promises and blessings out altogether.I'm thrilled that here is a book to enrich my family's prayer life and God's promises to pass on."
1,Not worth the money,Too expensive for what it is. The cartoons are only so-so. It does not have very many pages of cartoons.
4,Good gift for an older golfer,"Got this for my dad who is in his 60s and has been a golfer for years. He really enjoyed it all the way through. It wasn't the best in my opinion, but I don't play golf."
1,disappointing,"Being an avid golfer and devotee of the New Yorker, I was surprisingly disappointed at the few real laughs in this collection"
1,Not the best quality,"I returned this because the stitching looked very unprofessionally done. There were strings at the ends and the material had a stain on it (of a different color material). They were good about giving me a return, just had to pay for shipping. I was hoping it would be good but it's what you would expect for a $30 sling."
4,a life saver!,"I recieved this sling yesterday and it has been great today! My 3-week old nestles in nicely, tummy to tummy and I am able to get a few things done with my hands free! The only draw back I've found is that with a small baby, I need to really cinch it up and it's difficult to pull the padded rails through the rings to adjust it and to take it off."
2,Don't be misled.,"Don't be misled by this album. There is no Gram Parsons involvement on it, although the Amazon listing states that it is a ""2000 release for the late Gram Parsons' first band."" The album itself is not bad, but if you are looking for some long lost Gram Parsons recordings, they are not to be found here."
5,Happy Endings,"This show is absolutely hilarious. If you don't watch it, you're completely missing out. Each character is amazing in their own ways. Eliza Coupe and Damon Wayans, Jr as Jane and Brad have the most ridiculous chemistry and play off each other so well. I love Adam Pally as Max. Really I love all the characters, I don't think I could pick a favorite."
5,Funniest show on TV!,"Love this show! Some of the bonus portions are a bit slow moving, but the episodes are great, cast is great, show is hilarious..."
4,Great gift for my daughter,"made a real hit on Christmas. Got my 9 year old this and a charm, she can now personalize it any way she wants."
4,Good quality,"This starter bracelet is good quality, though not excellent. It is quite shiny and got a few small scratches rather quickly. I would still recommend it, since you will be changing out the charms anyways."
2,not real happy,I wasn't real happy when i got the 2 braclets and there are no instructions and no clasps/esplainations on how to close it.
3,"more like explores his inner ""demos",I have listened to this cd alot and have come to the conclusion that it is nothing more than 4 track demos of songs Ken wanted to use with the POSIES and exploring new directions that trendy music is taking. Ken lose the turn-table and MPC and grab the acoustic guitar and some other musicians and put out a solo effort worthy of the money spent on a cd and most of all your incredible talent. There are some great songs but they are so under-developed that only the very hardcore posies fan (me) could swallow. Sorry so rough but Ken and Jon were (are) some of the best alt. pop songwriters that ever collaborated. KEN DO A SERIOUS GUITAR RECORD< DO IT FOR YOUR FANS! We're waiting.
2,Too Bad...,"Some of the songs here would have been great had they been done by the Posies in the studio. Why Ken wanted to assault us with his demo noodlings is all more the puzzling. I mean..Revolution Number 9 has already been done.I think Big Star may have had an adverse affect on him. At any rate there are a couple good songs on here and only two stand on their own here in demo fashion i.e. ""Too True"" and ""Heres to the Future"". I hope that some day he looks back at a couple of these songs and takes another crack at them in the studio with Mitch easter at the helm."
2,"Buy ""Touched"" Instead.......Disappointing","4 Demos & filler is stretching it. ONLY purchase this album if you consider yourself a completist. I found this collection to be disjointed, slightly jagged, murky, and just depressing in general. I'm not sure where Ken wants to lead us, but I agree with another reviewer,,, pick up the acoustic guitar and write some SONGS. This album definately has an UNSETTLING aspect to it, perhaps Ken wnated a ""Sister Lovers"" (Big Star), or an ""I Am The Cosmos"" (Chris Bell) feel......sorry Ken, those two albums manage to have that quirky off-kilter feel to them with success, but yours does not."
1,cheated with demos,"The guy who said this was 4 demos and filler was right. Like he said in the Posies ""Don't waste yor time"" I hope he'll make it up to his fans for this Amazing Disgrace."
3,not what you think,"This 2007 CD, Heart of Havana (on Sony BMG's 'Latin Originals' label) appears to be a reprint of an LP (12 tracks, old RCA Victor logo on the cover). It has the same cover asThe Heart of Havana volume 1in the BMG Tropical Series, which was remastered from the original master tapes in the 1990s. That was a fantastic album and it's possible that it borrowed the cover from this LP. Don't get confused!! This is not the The Heart of Havana volume 1. It doesn't have the same tracks, and they are very unlikely to be remastered from the original tapes.This is disingenuous of BMG. I wish they would just reprint the entire BMG Tropical catalogue - that's what we want!!!"
3,"So, and so.","I did not have a choice in this being bought, my kid brother bought it for me because he wanted me to add it to my collection, and we both put it together and were having fun till things started falling apart, and we had to put pieces back together over and over before continuing.One thing I did not like about lego set was the way you basically just threw the figure in the cockpit, well not threw so much as finagling a way for him to fit in there with his blaster between his legs. And the lightsabers stored at the bottom, just a way to keep the set simple and cheap, which it was. I would recommend this if its going to sit on your shelf as a display, otherwise, don't buy it. But if you are a collector, that's a whole different story.- enrique"
3,the good and the bad,"I bought this toy for my six year old son. He really enjoyed putting it together and following the directions and step by step procedures. He plays with it like he plays with all of his legos, they stay together for about a week before they morph into something else, usually a combination of several different sets. That being said, it didn't stay together very well. The top repeatedly fell off within minutes of him finishing it. While he has enjoyed it, since he took it apart and used the pieces to make a ""robot jet boat,"" he was unable to play with it when he originally put it together without it falling ajpart. This is something he has been aboe to do with most of his other lego sets."
2,Worst of the lego ships....,"The poor general barely fits in the cockpit. You have to contort his arms/legs and then stuff him in. It takes 5-6 tries each time. The overhead falls off easily and holding the lightsabers underneath was a bad idea. Turning it over and over again leads it to fall apart and my daughter gets frustrated. Plus if you are not looking, you don't realize if a saber went missing during flight and we all know how hard they are to find. We have Anakin's and the Stormtrooper transport and they both are much better then this one. Save your money on this one..."
2,Genral Grievous would never fly in this thing!!!,"Nice on the outside but awful on the inside. I got this for my 11 year old and he has spent more time fixing it than playing with it!! The cockpit slides back to open, and that is neat, but those pieces come off so easily! My recomondation: Don't waste your money on this thing."
5,Ready for action...,"A pregnant Padme' with a blaster in hand, what's not to love? A wife, a mother, a senator, a fighter... now that's a role model!"
3,GOOD PADME BUT TWISTED,"All of my padmes either broke or i lost them.I was at wal mart looking for a new Padme and i found this one.i was excited at first but when I opened it and put it on the Mustafar display base her legs were uneven. And she has a man face. Also, Why would they make a Padme in a outfit she lies on the ground in?HINT: if you r in DESPRATE need of a padme figure, buy it. If u dont need one that bad, dont buy it."
4,Nice,"I bought this item for my fiancé who collects star wars toys. I ha issues with the postal service in my area. It was checked in my mailbox on December 24th. Which would have been great if it was actually there. My product did not show up till January 10th. Yes, I did confront the postal service and they denied ever having the package in the first place.My fiancé was impressed with the toy and says it will complete his padmeEvolution."
1,The best female figure in the line,"I just got it today, it's really fun to play with, it captures the characters likenss, it also is very detailed"
1,"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing, Baby","I'm sure tons of geeks and fanboys will rush out and get this Star Wars figure first but be warned! This is not a great surrogate for the real Natalie Portman and no, it won't make any of your dreams come true. Her likeness on the wrapping will do more for than her plastic counterpart. This thing is missing the warmth or humanity of the real thing. If this thing was maybe about 5' 4"" , 110 lbs, it might help, otherwise, stay away."
1,"Incomplete style, very vague.","I bought this book because it was recommended to me by others in my office, but I am honestly not satisfied with the book's vague definitions. It is also annoying the way the author is complimenting himself and his brilliance throughout the book, when a little more detail about the topic would be more usefull to those who really need as much information as they can get *like me*. This book is probably intended for those that have had a networking related job, but for me as a newbie it has left me with lots of questions after reading the definition. This is a great book if you don't need serious information, and it is great for finding out what abbreviations stand for. Some terms are defined well, but they are few."
5,A Must for Anyone in Telecommunications,This was one of the first books colleagues recommended when I started working for a telecom company. It's definitely not light reading but an excellent reference for anything related to the telecom industry.
2,Good Dictionary,"Lots of distractions, lots of frill, very broad and general. Good if you want to define abbreviations, not that good for study or learning. Too much old stuff. I have seen better books on telecom that are more up-to-date."
4,MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER NEED,"I was on the hunt for a book or manual that could give insight into the interesting world of Telecom. What a trunk line is, how many lines it has, how it differs & why you would use it instead of...Even people who have been in the world of telecom for many years realize that a lot has changed. I want something that would help them in their transition to make things easier. Everyone kept saying get the Newton's Telecom Dictionary; so I did, and it's great. It has more information than I think anyone will ever need, but if you don't know what you are looking for it's not very helpful."
5,I Love this Book!!,"I insist that all students who attend my TrainingCity.com voice and data communications training classes get a free copy of this book. If you are only going to buy one book this year, get this one!"
2,"KEEP YOUR EARLIER EDITION - Same book, different cover.","This book has been useful to me in the past for the very basic, however, I wish that it didn't hide it's lack of technical specifics with humor. I keep thinking that the next edition will be better, but it is just the same exact definitions reprinted in a different font size or style. Sometimes I am really needing to find a REAL definition that will help me, but, I find a joke instead, or something written a long time ago. I never know what to expect, since some things are loosley defined and some definitions are so technical that they defeat the whole purpose. I end up looking up several other terms. I once found this book fun to read, but now it is so full of old stuff that it is hard to find the current info, and harder to learn from. I have found that what I really need this book for is to define it's own definitions."
5,A good reference.,"I found this book very helpful in preparing a presentation for my college Datacom class. Newton's defintions are fairly simple to understand and are intermixed with some rather humorous definitions such as his definition of garage sales. I would recommend this book to any student majoring in Telecom or Computer Networking because it gives good, helpful definitions. One complaint I have about this book is that there are several spelling errors (mainly missed letters on the end of plural words) in the definitions I looked up which I found distracting."
5,Simply a must have!,This book is required in reading for students in my TrainingCity.com classes. If you work in voice or data communications you must own this book!
4,Great Book!,"I am doing a Masters Degree in Computer Systems and Information Technology (through distance learning), and this is one of the most important and useful books I have bought in the respect past. You will know this when you want to feel at home with terms that are unfamiliar and which IT and Telecom professionals use daily. In my opinion, it is a must-have."
4,Almost complete dictionary,"This book was really useful for me when I made the jump to the telecommunications industry. Being a network engineer, there were many terms in telecommunications I had never heard, or didn't really understand. This book is really convenient for quickly refreshing your mind what exactly a forgotten technical term means."
1,Drop the Book and Run,I would not recommend this book; I really could not find anything worth the time it took to read it. I only got half way through it and that was about 100 pages too much. There are too many good books out there.
5,One woman in eleven will experience a mastectomy,This inspiring diary takes you through two years of Mrs. Abbott's life--from the day she discovered a lump in her breast to the happy second anniversary of her successful operation. It follows her daily progress as she adjusts both physically and emotionally to the fact that she has lost a most important part of her body. But Mrs. Abbott's story is not one of depression and fear. Her upbeat attitude offers reassurance to the many who must deal with mastectomy.
2,"Cable is nice, but the software is useless","The MIDI/USB cable works as advertised, and I'm able to record music easily. The problem is, I bought this software to learn to PLAY piano...and it's entirely useless. The educational software is not compatible with Windows Vista, and the publisher does not offer product support for Vista users.I've tried every conceivable method to get this software to work on Vista, and it's a no-go. I even tried changing compatibility settings with no luck. I'm sure the software works great on older computers, but if you're running Vista, find something else."
3,USB MIDI for Vista,The USB MIDI cable works great with Windows Vista. I use it to play karaoke MIDI files on my laptop on my player grand piano.I can't say much for the accompanying Teach Me Piano program. Not nearly as good as the Piano Discovery Program (unfortunately discontinued).
1,"Waste of money, cable good","I downloaded this and of ALL the songs they give you in their library there is not one song I would want to waste my time learning. Unless you want to learn ""Farmer in the Dell"" go to YouTube and learn there for free. Did the software work? I did not waste my time even trying. The packaging wasn't bad."
1,Bad software,"Despite its age, I was willing to give ""Teach Me"" a shot. I worked dutifully through a few dozen lessons, but then as soon as multiple notes had to be played simultaneously, the software was unable to detect two notes at a time. I have the latest sound drivers and everything. Tech support was useless too."
2,"Old, old Software","The software is from windows 98 time. Error boxes that come up are from windows 98. I would download midi songs from the net and the program would give me an error.It claims that you can add your own songs to learn, but it doesn't get nearly as involved as songs that it comes with. It was only worth it for the cable that it comes with. I am looking for other software to try and learn piano."
1,Frustrating,I wish had been wiser. I thought it would be easier. Bah! There are NO short cuts to learning piano?
1,No Vista!,It's a pity the product is not compatible with Vista - therefore useless unless you have an old pc.
5,The gem of the ROTS line...,"Forget what you've been told. This puppy is the rarest and best ROTS figure. It came out in April with the rest of the first 32 figures, but has consistantly proven the toughest to find. I had no trouble with Tarkin, 3PO, Padme...but I just couldn't get my hands on Blue here without utilizing connections at work (i.e., asking a coworker to stick one in the back for me--I work at a toy store). As a matter of fact, they told me that every Blue Royal Guard they've stocked has been sold within the hour.And for good reason! Blue here is well-articulated, can actually be put in dynamic poses (a first for the guard figures, I believe), and underneath his 2-piece softgoods robe is a detailed set of body armor, quite a far cry from the ""salt-shaker"" POTF2 Emperor's Guard. Rare, valuable, and fun to play with--he hits all the right spots. Get yourself one!"
5,Rare Item,The Royal Blue Guard is extremely rare. I have been to about 15 places and none have had it buy it while you can!
5,A Must have!,"A rare figure! Not as rare as the red variation of the royal guard, but a must have for any collector. Insanly hard to find! When I bought mine, the hour after they were sold out! Get them before they're gone!"
1,"It's no ""Pat the Bunny""","Horrible book. I wouldn't pay 50 cents at a garage sale for it. We were expecting another Pat the Bunny, which my daughter reads 20 times a day. This book is pathetic in it's attempts at interaction, and only offers a few pages of fuzzy creatures to touch and a door to open. Totally useless."
5,Excellent noise suppression but not the best available,"Noise Ninja works well to suppress noise in images from my Sony A900 camera for ISO 800 and below. At ISO 1600 and above, too much residual noise remains. I like the fact that Noise Ninja can operate either in stand alone mode or as a plug-in to Adobe Photoshop.However, for some cameras a better choice is DxO Labs Optics Pro Elite v5.3.5 that does suppress noise well for Sony images up to ISO 3200. Optics Pro suppresses the noise in RAW images at the de-mosaicing stage where more information is available. Noise Ninja has less information available because it suppresses noise after the image has been converted from RAW format to RGB. Still, Noise Ninja with is a valuable piece of software. I particularly like its method for creating noise profiles at each ISO from the calibration chart that is supplied with Noise Ninja. I have even used Noise Ninja in conjunction with Optics Pro to suppress noise by two somewhat different methods."
3,Old Version,While this software works well this is an old version of this product that's priced not too much lower than the latest version. If I had to do it over I woulkd have bough the up-to-date version.
2,"This ain't live, y'all","I love Patti and Labelle and the Bluebelles, but I am sorry to say that only one of the songs on this album is live! I was excited to see that such an album existed, especially knowing Patti and Labelle's reputations as live performers, so I snatched it right up. But what I actually got is the most ridiculous cd idea ever: it is the studio version of their songs with recorded applause added to the begining and end of each song. ""Tear After Tear"" is in fact live, which is totally cool. If you are a die-hard fan, buy this (if you can get it real cheap) just for that track. Otherwise, stick to the compilations. What gives?"
4,Stunning Beauty in Upstate New York,"I live within a hour or two of all these beautiful spots and am ashamed to have only visited a couple. We will use these gorgeous photos as a guidebook for the Spring, Summer and Fall to make certain we don't miss a one.Why did I think I have to travel far for scenery of this caliber.?"
4,An early revolution in latin hip hop.,"This is the first musical work of the guy now known as johnny prez by then he uses to be call ezd, whom together mc nick started a flowless way of raping the mob. I sure recommend this album to everyone interested in knowing about the roots of nowdays latin hip-hop. I gave it four stars because the guys were not on the top of their shape for it, but almost no one starts doing anything right away at the top."
4,"One of my 'favorites""!","First and foremost, I truly enjoy listening to Bobby. He is a great artist with an awesome voice and with great background music. I have never purchased an album manufactured in Asia, but this one did not disappoint. This is my fourth album and I never tire of Bobby's songs and voice. This is a great mix of some of his older hits and I believe, have been paired well. This is a great album to purchase, if you are a Bobby Caldwell fan and can assure the purchaser, ""you won't be disappointed"". Sit back, relax and enjoy this amazing and talented artist!"
2,"If there is a translation in this, I missed it","I really tried to finish this book, but there is only so much preaching one can take. The feeling reading this is that there is less of a translation being presented than the author's interpretation of the work. After being told several times what God thinks, or must have thought, or what God really meant but was misstated as the stories were passed along and re-written, the entire basis for a ""new translation"" seemed suspect. Most people will be better served by reading mainstream translations (with study notes for in-depth analysis). Many of these are written by scores of biblical scholars collaborating together and working with original texts. NIV, NASV, or other respected translations should be baseline reading...then interpretations such as this one can be read critically."
1,Overpriced garbage that is virtually unreturnable!,"Bought this overpriced garbage and the handle fell apart after just a few days, the swivel attachment rotates downward from the weight of the handle until it falls out and onto the person bathing and the cord started leaking at the connections. No amount of plumbers tape could fix the leak and the handle peices open and close like a clamshel as you move it. Thanks to its inflexible height I needed to make holes in the tiles to install it, so now the choice is to either find a different unit exactly the same height, replace the tiles or just continue to use this junk. Almost forgot to mention that everything except the vertical bar and the soap dish are made of plastic NOT CHROME, even the bar-end mounting knobs are plastic!"
3,"""Not the original recordings""","My review of ""Great Guy Mitchell"" covers this release too as it contains the same tracks although this one gives you 6 more for your money. These are not the original 1950s Hit versions of the songs but re-recordings he did in 1982. They are in stereo(unlike the originals - stereo was then still some years away) but it must be said that they lack the full power of the Mitch Miller backings that the originals have. To me these versions sound more akin to the way he performed them ""live"" in later years with smaller backing groups. If you want to know more please take a look at my other review."
4,JVCC EL7566-AW PREMIUM GRADE ELECTRICAL TAPE: 1/2 IN X 66 FT. BLK.,"I knew exactly what I would use this tape for. In my case it was to repair the standard end of a USB connector cable that was beginning to show wear. The only con comment I have is that the manufacturer should have made the tape with slightly more stick power because although I applied the tape with tension, there was some degree of relaxation within the tape shown by loosening of the applied tape."
5,Amazon Does It Again!,First I found it almost impossible to fine this width anyplace else. But then the service was rapid and the product EXACTLY as advertised!
4,"Great tape, great price","The tape was a good price and it works really well. I wasn't too sure about the quality because of its price, but once I used the first role I was pleased. Has a good high quality feel. I would recommend this product to anyone."
2,Basic Invoicing,there are better programs. You will spend either the same amount or a little more. If you are a business that does not do its own books but you need excellent billing/invoicing...try kBilling. Just Google search the term invoice software.there are better more fully functioning programs than this piece of junk by Inuit. this program is meant to get you to try Quicken or QuickBooks more than it is designed to do invoicing. And Intuit actually makes you pay for itHA!
4,Software is easy to use and very worth the money!,I really like the software. I LOVE how you can email the estimates/invoices. The emails they produce are very professional and exactly that I wanted to see.
1,This book does not show the Bible is unreliable,"While I have not read this book, I did want to point out that it DOES not show that the Bible is unreliable. People have been predicting the end for hundreds and hundreds of year. When people make a prediction, they are making a guess based on the interpretation they formed while reading the Bible. The Bible says that the end will come ""like a theif in the night."" In other words, nobody knows for sure."
1,OOPS! DOH!,"I suppose he did say ""could return"" not will for definate. Still a bit of a clanger though. A lot of writing to make an invalid point."
1,Outdated But Shows That the Bible is Unreliable,"The year is now 2001 and this book is no longer worth buying. But it shows in a way the Bible is a unreliable, inaccurate document that contains ""threats"" to win converts."
2,Disappointed,"I suppose I was influenced by all the glowing reviews and perhaps expected so much more. I was quite disappointed and found myself struggling to get through the book (only because it was referred to me by my best friend so I held onto the hope the final pages would somehow make up for a mediocre novel).I felt the sisters or ""The Girls"" were written as children even into their adult years and I couldn't help but find them often whiny and annoying even faced with the seriousness of their situation. I didn't sense this preternatural connection between the two sisters beyond their pinching of one another to signal their displeasure.I wanted to like the book and I wanted to feel for the characters. The concept is unique and interesting but the execution was a little off for me."
5,WOW,"This book made me smile, laugh, and cry. What a beautiful story of two sisters connected physically and emotionally. I wanted this one to be real when I finished--it was just amazing. Great author, can't wait to read her future stories. Loved the beginning--kind of wizard of ozzy--ending was beautiful, sad, but beautiful."
5,The Girls,"A profound story of love. When I started this book it was so graphic that I almost put it aside. My daughter convinced me to stay with it. I am soooo happy that I did. It is a beautiful story of parental love, sibling love and devotion. It is written from two points of view that make it more intrigueing and fulfilling. Lori Lansens imagination is incredible because the entire book reads like a true story. Bravo!"
4,Riveting,"This is a special book about an extremely unusual medical condition that few people experience. Conjoined twins has always been an engrossing anomaly that captures our attention and breaks our hearts. The day-to-day logistics and the thought of never being alone, even in death, are beyond comprehension. I think that Lansens did a masterful job of portraying conjoinment in this sensitive and very well written accounting of the lives of Rose and Ruby. There was no sensationalism, no pruient details - but a poignancy that developed through our knowledge of their world and those who loved them. There is a grace to the writing that is consistent until the end, and I am very grateful for talented authors like Lori Lansens. I look forward to reading her books in the future."
5,Bravo!,"Just wanted to add my 0.02$, this book was amazing and worth every penny I sent on it. I have recommended it to my friends and now to you."
1,Boring,"I bought this book based on the high reviews, and was highly disappointed. I finished the book because I kept thinking that it has to get better. By the end, I had only tears of joy that it was over."
2,Skim it,The premise seemed interesting but was overly repetitive. I found little emotion in the story line and writing . Just skim the book and slow down if a passage is interesting.
4,"Compelling subject, beautiful story, fantastic writing","""The Girls"" is the story of conjoined twins, told in the spirit of an autobiography. Rose and Ruby each tell their shared story from their own point of view, and Lansens does an amazing job of giving each girl her own distinct voice. I was worried that conjoined twins would be a difficult subject for an author to tackle, but Lansens has done an excellent job of telling the story of two ordnary girls living their lives under extraordinary circumstances. Every minute of their lives in their small, quiet, country town is interesting, because of their special situation and their unique relationship. From the story of their birth in the midst of a tornado to their struggles on their journey to adulthood, Lansens' examination of the fascinating, intertwined lives of ""The Girls"" captured me from the first page and didn't let me go until the last syllable. Highly recommended."
4,Loved this novel,"I had a tough time at the beginning of this novel trying to figure out if I would enjoy it. But my the middle I was not enjoying it, I was eating it up with a spoon. I loved these two girls and reading about their adventures. Even though I knew it was fiction I couldn't help thinking somewhere two girls were living this conjoined life. It gave me a glimpse into something that I was not familiar with am intent on becoming more familiar with."
5,Great story,I just finished listening to this book on CD in my car. I found myself looking for reasons to go for a drive. Very well written.
2,Not up to Par,"I loved all the other books by this author, I found this one boring and could not wait for it to end."
4,The Girls,"Interesting and lyrical, this story gives the reader insight into what it would be like to have never truly had a second to yourself in your entire life. The descriptions of life as a conjoined twin captivated me. A fault would be that while beautifully written, some of the passages not directly related to the girls' ""situation,"" were a little long and superfluous."
4,Just a couple of ordinary girls,"The Girls is the well-written and interesting story of conjoined twins. Despite their uncommon condition, their life story is pretty ordinary, but I think that is the idea. First, that despite the accommodations they need to make for each other, their lives are more alike everyone else than different. Second, as their aunt Lovey says, everyone leads an extraordinary life in the midst of the mundane. There are a few surprises, but for the most part, it is the glimpse we see of their inner lives that makes this a compelling and interesting read."
2,"My pleasure in the novel,""The Girls.""","My interest in the subject was very particular. I'm am preparing to direct a theatrical rpoduction about conjoined twins and was told about this book and it was very helpful to me in my understanding of the accomodations two completely individual woman had to learn to make in order to live together, physically joined. I found the Characters real and engrossing and i was taken along for quite an emotional experience as the story unfolded. I would reccomend this Novel to anyone!"
2,Don't you guys watch TLC?,"It was obvious from page one that the author based her story on Lori and Reba Schappell, real life craniopagus conjoined twins. One problem: the story of Lori & Reba is infinitely more uplifting and interesting than any novel that tackles this subject, this one included.The whole book didn't seem to have a direction. The two seperate voices were disjointed from each other, and while I know I shouldn't be expecting a life-affirming message from the doomed twins, it would have been nice to have something to take away from reading ""The Girls"" other than thinking ""That rather sucked. What should I read next?"""
1,The best book ever? Are you serious? BORING,"While I agree that a book about conjoined twins would be interesting, this is not that book. I was bored, the book was slow and tedius. I did not cry at the end and I'm the kind of person who cries over tv commercials! I wonder about the folks who say this is the best book they have ever read. Have you read Memoirs of a Geisha or The Secret Life of Bees or The Dog in the Night Time? There are good books and great books and this one is neither. It passes the time, but that's about it."
4,Please read this book!,"Having finished this novel, I am lonely for the girls. What a wonderful story, what interesting characters, what a unique writer's vision. Don't miss this amazing adventure!"
2,The Girls,"Interesting and unusual topic for a novel, one that appealed to my own personal ""twin"" sensibilities. However, the book got a bit repetitive; and, definitely somewhat far-fetched as for each twin's ability to function as independently of the other as they purportedly did. Not a bad read...but, I would have trouble recommending it."
5,Best book I have EVER read,"Truly the most amazing story. I didn't want it to end, and I cannot get it out of my mind. Just read it."
4,Interesting,I find conjoined twins fascinating -- I liked that it was written by both girls...neat concept. Quick and easy read
1,Yawn,"Picked to read this book based on the interesting subject/storyline and all the great reviews. This was one of the most boring stories I have ever read. It started out good enough, but as we learned more and more about the sisters, I started to care about them less and less. A shame, because it's such an interesting premise. The sisters may have well been two separate people (two uninteresting, boring people specifically).I usually harp on people that write reviews without finishing a book. I'm about 70% done and I can't read anymore. I wouldn't even bother writing a review, but feel that I should try and combat some of the 5 star reviews to get a more accurate overall rating.Not recommended."
2,Kind of a Snooze.,I was excited to buy this book because the topic was unique and interesting. An interesting topic is about all this book has to offer. I usually like first person but I still didn't feel drawn in to the experience of the characters. The two voices would be great if they were not so repetitive. They didn't sound like two different people at all. It would have been nice if they at least had there own distinct personalities but they didn't. Somehow it just didn't work. I didn't even finish the book.
2,It was okay,"We read this book as a selection for our monthly book club. Based on reviews of the book, I really thought I was going to love it. The beginning was great and I really enjoyed the book until about half way through. Then it was all I could do to finish it.Personally, I would not recommend this book. It just got real slow and boring."
3,Ho Hum,"The writing was superb and it had a beautiful ending. I just became bored as both girls took turns writing about the important events and people in their lives. The narration wasn't even in chronological order which added to the ""rambling"" effect. I do appreciate Larsen's work; I loved Rush Home Road. This novel just didn't hold my attention though."
2,Interesting topic but poorly written,"Learning about the twin's life is very interesting, but the book lacks a clear direction, and is a bit sloppy at points. So much of the books is good, but is organized and told in such a confussing way it becamee more annoying than enjoyable. What editor would allow for so many parenthesis is baffling."
2,Girls not that great,"Novel, fiction, some untruths in this book. Yes it is fiction butsome parts unbelievable."
3,Best book I read this summer,This book was heart breaking and heart warming. a great story and writing.I meant to give this 5 stars but cannot edit it. sorry
4,The Girls,"This is such a beautiful story about conjoined twins. There wouldn't be anything special about it if it were just about them, but as it is the story isn't just about them, it's written from their perspective, and Lori Lansens does an excellent job with it... It feels almost as if these girls are real, and it was them who were telling me their story. I laughed, I cried, and I just think this is an overall good book. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because it seemed to drag on in parts..."
5,A book you will feel the need to pass on to friends,"I felt compelled to give a copy of this unique and warm insight to my mother, daughter and best friend. I will read it again in a few years to remind myself about the lessons I learned about love, compassion and tolerance."
4,Very touching!,"This novel taught me that even the greatest hindrances can't stop some people. The way Lori Lansens wrote ""The Girls"" makes it seem less fictional than it really is. She used simple everyday words, yet filled them with emotion, and gave the characters life with imagery and anecdotes. ""The Girls"" makes for a good ""comfort book."""
3,Just ok,This was notas good as the previous book I read by this author. It was too distracting to keep the girls apart. I read all of it but just didn't find the whole story believable.
5,The author got it!,"I felt like the author was one of the girls. The book rang so true one felt the author must have known girls in this situation, at least."
3,"Well written, but not a topic for a novel","I chose this rating because, for me, it's not a great topic for a novel. It would be good documentary subject if welll-written. Maybe I should explain that I am a member of a book club, and this was one of the choices for the year."
4,Intresting consept,"I enjoyed the descriptions of life in rural US. How we react to ''the abnormal'' is pretty grim , but true. Then I found delivery of baby not believeable, one midwife would/could do delivery, but unlikely that friends would help when it is illegal not to register every delivery. ( its the midwife in me being objective) . I know rural areas differ from citys in many ways. A book that makes you think."
3,A Good Read,"When I initially started reading the book, I forgot that it was a NOVEL ... and not a true story. I really got into it and enjoyed it until about the half way point, at which time I remembered that it was a NOVEL. At that point I started wondering how I could possibly have been so gullible as to think it was a true story; I don't think it could POSSIBLY be a true story. And this realization dampened my enthusiasm, and I skimmed the rest of the book."
5,"Unforgettable, Heart-Wrenching, Inspiring, Awesome Story","I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but was floored by the beautiful writing, the prosaic metaphors, the sheer beauty of the entire story. . . not something you'd expect in regard to a tale of conjoined twins, fiction or not. It truly touched my soul and made me look at life through different eyes. I can only count on one hand the books that have affected me like this one.When I read the last few pages yesterday, I was weeping. I didn't want the book to end. It wasn't a sad ending, I just didn't want the story to EVER end. I don't like giving book reports, but suffice it to say that this book will move into your heart and soul after you read it and will never completely leave you. A magnificent book, pure and simple. It deserves 10 stars and a Pulitzer Prize."
3,A Unique Story,"Lori Lansens must be a poet--Her words are lyrical and lovely-- and flow on the pages effortlessly. She makes the reader fall in love with Rose and Ruby; I know I did. And of course, Aunt Lovey!!! Unconditional love can save the world. Can't it?I loved the chapter where Ruby experiences her first orgasm. Miss Lansen, How did you write this so beautifully--so eloquently?I gave the book 3 stars because I was bored with the chapters about traveling to Uncle Stashes home in Europe (it did not add to the story or push it forward) I wanted more about Rose and Ruby---not Uncle Stash!I wanted more insight about how people viewed these conjoined twins--they appeared to be accepted everywhere and by everyone--and this did not ring true to me. Most people would be fascinated, surprised, appalled, and terrified.All in all--I liked this book and would read another by this articulate poet, Miss Lansens!"
5,Unforgettable!,"I finished ""The Girls"" a couple of days ago, and it continues to haunt me. I keep thinking of it and am having a hard time concentrating on a new book. I suppose I was attracted by the theme of conjoined twins and was curious to see how the author would present it. It's actually a positive story of two girls, conjoined at the head, who manage to carve out a productive and happy life, with the support of loving adoptive parents.Perhaps the ending is a bit down, but Ms. Lansens handles it beautifully. I highly, highly recommend ""The Girls."""
3,1434/1421,"After reading the two above titles, I became interested in ships of the time period. Fighting ships of the far east vol 1 certianly delivers as far as the fighting aspect of the ships are concerned. However the main shortfall is the protection services these ships would have offered to the huge exploration fleets sent abroad during that time to explore the world. If you are intersted in the fighting ships of the period from the far east, then this is one of the books for you"
3,Not the product I was expecting,"I use orange peel in baking, which can be tedious and time consuming. I purchased this item to help save time, but was a bit disappointed. These are a nice candy to snack on, but for baking I need something less sugary and with more flavor. If you're looking for a snack, then these may be a good choice, but for my needs I will just stick with making my own fresh orange peel."
3,Like Swallowing Glass,Violetta is hardcore in both senses of the word. This is definitely in the post-Atari Teenage Riot camp: Digital Hardcore in extremis. She has obviously been infected by the rage virus from 28 Days Later and is rabid. But there is no actual emotion to her rage. Since she has no tenderness the screech is monotonous. Needless to say this is sadly due to a deep nihilism in her worldview. The album has some honesty as an example of the emotional dead end of our times. I hope Miss Violetta can find something redeeming in all of the puke and pus of this world.
1,This Gargled Seth Rogen's Balls,"This wasn't music, this was a train wreck. And if you want to hear a train wreck then listen to this. Crank it loud and feeeeel your nuts shrivel and your sperm swim up into your stomach to die an acid bath death. This is the kind of music you listen to after a breakup and right before you reach for the shotgun to take your own life. This is the inverse of what Samwise says in ""Lord of the Rings"" - there is bad in the world and its not worth listening to."
3,One Problem,"I was disappointed to find out that you can not turn off the ringer on this phone. I actually called Toshiba to see how to turn the ringer off and the customer service representative said that they get that question at least 15 times a day and that it is just not possible with this phone. So, I have no idea if the phone works well or not because I had to return it"
3,Just returned my Toshiba SG1000,"I came here hoping to find a unit to replace my Toshiba SG1000. So I wanted to compare user ratings for it vs. others as a benchmark. So I see the Toshiba is getting better ratings than most others. It's a wonderful unit, has a comfortable feel, but noise problems heard by caller and receiver, no matter how far the phone is from the base unit, made this far more annoying than an old AT&T 900 digital I used to use. I tried unpluggin the unit, as the manual suggested. No difference. Battery life seemed excellent. But the occasional, yet everpresent, noises (clicks and subtle pops and static) were annoying and unprofessional for both caller and receiver. I can only assume these noises occur when the phone changes frequencies - a function of digital spread spectrum, but one that I did not experience with the old AT&T phone."
1,NOT 100% COTTON!,"False advertising, this says 100% cotton, but it is not, it is 65% polyester. Very disappointed and returning them."
4,Great Information For Those who Truly Need It,"A Wealth Of Information, January 1, 2005Reviewer: Franklin P. (Los Angeles, CA) - See all my reviewsI truly enjoyed this author's workshop also. I've seen several authors in person and they usually provide more information in person. That doesn't distract from the importance of this book. It contains a wealth of information especially for women like me who is rebounding from divorce with children. I've seen this author, Suze Orman (Oprah Magazines), Tiffany Love (Survivng Financial Disasters from TV) and I say that they all have great solutions for tackling creditors and erasing debt. Sometimes it seems frightening, but they make it simple. Buying their books costs less than hiring an attorney, so you truly do save a lot money."
3,"""Zero Debt"" review...","Overall this is a good book for a beginner looking to organize their life, finances, and plan well financially for the future. I already knew 95% of the info in this book, or had read it elsewhere so it wasn't very enlightening to me. Still a good read for those starting out in the world or graduating from college, and looking to establish and maintain good credit."
5,Great advice!,"Lynnette interviewed me years ago. Since then, I have gotten rid of $40,000 in debt. I ordered these books to gain some more knowledge. I hope I am as successful in improving my credit with her tips."
4,Good Common Sense Approach!,Lynette Khalfani really says it the way it is. She takes a no nonsense approach to zero debt. A great book for those needing a kick in the pants to get their finances in order and a great reminder for those who are progressing to financial freedom.This is a easy read with great examples and suggestions to help one achieve thier financial goals. Highly recommended.
3,Good information for getting your finances on track,"Very good book. She has others - one geared toward college grads that I hear is good. Offers good practical advice, doesn't talk above you."
2,Debt Solution: Just Pay your Debt,"The author paid off her debt by cashing in her $80,000 IRA and paid the rest off with her paycheck, interst and all. I don't have an $80k IRA or a Masters Degree or a job with a major tv network. If the system doesn't work for someone wealthy like her - then there really is something wrong! For the average middle class consumer though - who is maxed out on their credit cards - I find no relief in this book. Pretty much it says Just pay off your debt - double your payments even - find some way to make more money to do it. Why did she write a book? This doesn't tell me anything or help me in anyway."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This book is about a girl named Ruby Jo wholives on a rice plantation in South Carolina. During the week she takes care of her mistress' two daughters, the nice sweet Missy Linda and Dat Ole Snooty One, Latitia Belle, who has temper tantrums and SINGS LIKE A FROG! At that time it's against the law for slaves to read and write, so Ruby Jo sneaks out at night to Mas Chester's secret Pit School, and she learns how to read and write. At Pit School she befriends Taleteller Frank who entertains folks with his tales about that Ole Speckledy Spider Bill. She also makes friends with the light-skinned gal, Emily. The three friends have adventures together on the plantation, and then the mistress moves her family and slaves to the city of Charles Town for the summer. There they witness Blackbeard and his piraty men hold the city hostage. You will not be able to PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!! I recommend it to EVERYONE!"
5,I love NEOGURI,"I often eat three NEOGURI per day.Break fast, lunch, and dinner.You can cook them using bowl and microwave even if there is no pan.Enjoy!!"
2,HIGH IN MSG AND FAT,"It's hot and taste very shrimpy.Be Aware! They are very high in fat and MSG. If I knew this, I was not gonna buy it.Not Recommended!"
5,"My favorite spicy Korean ""instant"" noodles","I say that they're ""instant"" noodles because, to the uninitiated, it might come as a shock that you actually have to boil the noodles rather than simply soak them in boiling hot water. The preparation time is still very quick, and it's definitely worth it.These noodles are far thicker and chewier than your standard supermarket Top Ramen noodles. They also come with a spice package and a dry ingredients packet that contains bits of seaweed, mushrooms, and carrots.I usually only put in about 3/4 of the spice package and add extra ingredients like nappa cabbage, shrimp, scallops, green onions, mung bean sprouts, and/or an egg. Kimchi also goes really well with these noodles.The bulk price that Amazon offers is an excellent deal, especially for people who don't have access to Asian supermarkets. It's the perfect food to have for when you want a quick and flavorful meal."
5,delicious but not for everyone,"In my book, these noodles are even more delicious than the flagship shin ramyun ""spicy picante"". The noodles are coarser than even the shin variety, perhaps the coarsest noodles you'd find in a pack of instant ramen, and are billed as ""udon type"". They certainly are chewier, and have a slight potato starch flavor, which is delicious.However, the ride-along packets may not be for everyone. From what I understand, the company came up with these noodles after extensive taste-testing to make up for their relatively late start in the instant ramen industry. However, bear in mind that these taste tests were done in Korea. So if you don't like korean cuisine, you will not like these. The soup base is fiery hot with a touch of squid flavor (tip: don't add the whole packet). The vegetable packet is filled with seaweed (mainly kombu kelp), and tastes very fishy.Delicious I find these, but not everyone will."
4,good stuff,its hard to find good asian food in rural america. I'm glad I can get the good stuff through amazon. Beats the 12/$1 el cheapo stuff at your local walmarts!
5,I love these noodles!!,"Yummy! these noodles are so good!!! Its also really spicy so I only use half of the flavor packet- still taste just as good. It deosn't compare at all to those ramen noodles. In fact, I will never eat ramen noodles again after finding out about this product. These noodles are way better-thick and chewy. I like the little bits of seaweed in the soup. One bag of noodles is so satisfying. These are the best instant noodles ive every had!! I highly recommend this product!"
3,Disappointed,This probably isn't a bad movie. Full of physical action etc but I'm biased; I read the book. And the movie is nothing like it. I can understand that Frederick Forsyth's original story might have been too tough to transfer to the big screen but the movie lacks the Forsythian complexity and intrigue of the book. Compared with the book the movie plot is insipid. I'm surprised that Forsyth had anything to do with it (he was a story consultant or somesuch). But if you haven't read the book then you might find the movie enoyable. If you have read the book don't bother.
5,FINEST PATRICK SWAYZE MOVIE,I own just about all ofPatrick Swayze's movies andthis is by far the best.
3,Good action movie,The movie was worth watching -only problem was - the Bonus movie Holcroft Covenant is no where to be found
3,Beware of Sizes,"Size runs SMALL. A 38 is generally very comfy and almost loose on me, these two were unwearable at their 38 designation."
2,gunned down,his is quite a rare movie so I was pleased to be able to purchase it. As usual with all this old stuff I (we)live in hopethat the company marketing it has gone to some trouble to remaster the film but why by no means is this the worst I have bought its no where near worthy of spending your money on blurred and often colour dropout you are all aware of this with amlost 90% of what is being marketed out there however rare it is worth buying if you live in the usa where the postage is fair trying the same getting it from accross the water and the disc is the cheapest part of the deal.I plan sometime in the future when I have the time to write a book rating the rubbish that companys expect us to buy Al Watts Radio presenter Australia
2,DiG A HOLE & throw this piece of poop in...,"These bands are talented revivalists, but of little interest otherwise. Only kids too young to remember better will think this is any good. And others...well I guess they just can't see beyond the impotency of the music and why it's no longer vital anymore.What a deluded dweeb that BJTM leader is...it's one thing to believe in your own abilities. But to degrade everyone around you and then yourself in order to spit out some hackneyed notion of 'revolutionary' music is retarded.The most amazing thing about this film is that anyone thought it was a good idea to film it."
2,Didn't DiG It !,"The premise of this film, a not so convincing rivalry between two upstart bands, is a rather shakey foundation to build a documetary on. Do these bands really give a piss about each other? I didn't believe it for even 1/2 a second. The film rambled on and on in a lukewarm fashion about two so-so bands without supplying any emotional content what so ever. The fact that it was 7 years in the making just drove home the point that there really wasn't any point of view going on from the director. Skip it, unless you love the music of Warhols or the BJM."
4,What a putz,"DiG is a good, interesting, and intriguing documentary about two West Coast bands who never really made it. The one thing the dcoumentary did for me was show me what a putz and ignoramus Antone Newcombe is. The Brian Jonestown Massacre is a band that could never have made it. The Dandy Warhols, perhaps. Antone Newcombe is so self-destructive, selfish, egotistical, and maniacal that he is only capable of destroying whatever he touches. I was going to buy two of their albums, but when I saw DiG, I decided that there was no way I am going to give any of my money to such a dip-stick. He doesn't deserve anything except an ass kicking. The documentary, however, is very good."
4,A trainwreck,"Fascinating viewing for the morbidly curious...very enjoyable though, at the end of the day. I have to say that, though the stance of the movie is that BJM are great, unsung geniuses, I, personally, didn't get it, far preferring the Dandies' music.Whichever you prefer, your interest won't flag for a second, nor will you easily forget, this riveting doc..."
1,Pass On This One,"Trying so hard to be different only makes you the same. There's no musical genius here just typical young people spouting tired cliches about ""revolution"" and ""selling out"".One hopes they'll grow out of it. Charting their progress into adulthood would make a far better documentary. As it is, pass on this one if you value your time."
4,Watch it!!,"Probably the best rock documentry movie you will see this year.Anton Newcombe, BJM lead man, is a real gift to the music industry, every band or songwriter that ever got close to him became succesfull, except from himself.Check out Joel Gion perfomance, which is so fresh and funny.Another good documentry you should check is ""Grizzly Man"", which is even better then ""Dig!"""
5,Anton is genius.,"This movie is great, except for the one very important case that Anton was shown the way he was. After you watch this movie go and research Anton and the BJM. You'll realize that after his breakdown he kept making amazing records. I got into a whole new world because of this film. I went in for the Dandys and got out with the BJM in mind, now my favorite band. Also theres an everlasting showing of drama and interesting scenarios in the movie. I assure your going to be entertained by the literally the Tambourine man. You will enjoy this and if you do research after; you will know exactly how honest this film is but never the less I enjoyed this greatly.I have alot of ""you will's"" you will feel however you feel. Mostly likely good."
2,beware: unfair and pompous,"I felt this dvd, while very entertaining and informative, made Anton Newcombe look horrible. While he is known to be disruptive, and hard to get along with at times, how does he get people to continue to work with him? He must be doing something right.Do yourself a favor and explore thses two bands yourself. Go to their websites. Listen, for free, to BJM's albums and read what Anton felt about the movie.I found this documentary was way too tipped in the Dandy Warhol's favor, painting them in a nice light, while abandoning Anton's group."
1,Wow. Over-priveledge at it's finest...,"It's a shame that none of Anton's band-mates have the spine to properly put him in his place. Instead they allow him to continually destroy everything they work for because he believes that he is such a scary genius. This guy could use a few doses of humbleness as well as a good punch in the face. I'm available to give him both. Would Robert Plant act this way? Not a chance. Would any other human who has actual talent (and a brain) dare to act this way? Not a chance. This is a grown-spoiled-brat-baby-man that made me want to puke in his stupid mouth whenever he opened it. Great film making, but I feel very sorry for anyone who had to be subjected to this loser-man-child's actions while they practiced their craft. Anton, there is a pool of your own vomit somewhere waiting for you to drown in it. Drink up."
2,ignore these reviews,"the preservation of some semblance of intellectual integrity compels me to note for readers of these reviews that the lengthy and glowing review of bodansky's book by greg copley is a serious disservice to amazon's system for rating books. copley and bodansky are very close friends and work together. bodansky writes regularly for copley's publication, and his review scarcely qualifies as impartial. the personal relationship between the two makes copley's review the equivalent of bodansky reviewing himself. caveat emptor."
1,"Utter nonsense disguised as ""fact""","One word: bollocks.Remember: this is the guy who coined the phrase ""axis of evil"". He's simply a Zionist hack who happens to have gotten on the Congressional gravy train. The fact that some in Congress and the Bushies take him seriously is no reason for anyone else to do so."
1,Copley protests too much. This book is bad.,"Gregory Copley clearly wants this book to be successful--he's posted three long reviews now. But leave aside his bickering with another reviewer and assess the book on its merits (or lack thereof): the book is overly long, insufficiently or vaguely sourced, a mix of rumor and innuendo with fact (and it's nearly impossible to tell which is which because of Bodansky's vague sourcing). Bodansky obviously knows a lot about these issues, but his willing opaqueness--and his poor writing--make this book practically worthless. Don't waste your time. You won't learn anything from this doorstop of a book."
1,Only one star,"because thats the lowest grade Amazon allows me to give for this book. The book is has a strong conspiracy background, its sometimes fun to read, but the many mistakes and factual errors are really annoying."
1,Just Plain Asinine,"I was attracted to this book by the dust jacket cover, knowing nothing about Mr. Bodansky starting out. Like many other reviewers I was at first annoyed and then flabbergasted by the lack of reliable citation or follow up on incredible stories (some guy in a Muq'ha told me so it must be true). Based on this book alone, I would recommend against ever purchasing or reading any of Bodansky's other books. I quit reading the book about halfway through, you would be wise never to start."
4,"Nice guidebook - good photographs, diagrams, and explanations.","I bought this guide book at the Sant'Antimo monastery in Italy. It is filled with photographs, diagrams, and explanations. It has separate sections on History (of the priest, the abbey, sculptor, restoration, etc), Art, and Community. Great to buy before going to the abbey so you know the history and recognize what you see."
2,LACKING ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING!,"I BOUGHT IT CAUSE IM A SUPER AMERICAN BEAUTY FAN AND SAW THE LITTLE PICTURE ON THE SIDE OF THE COVER, THEN I SAW IT LISTED IN THE OSCAR WINNERS, BUT GUESS WHAT? NO REVIEW ABOUT IT!"
4,"Good, but less user-friendly than it used to be","The Video Movie Guide is useful, but it should be more user-friendly. For example, past editions marked the actor and director indices clearly ON EVERY PAGE. Now if you want to find a director or actor you have to thumb around the back of the book with no way of knowing whether you're in the director or actor section. It's very frustrating. I'd also like to see them bring back the appendices listing four and five star movies. On the plus side, it's great that the authors have finally done away with the silly genre categories."
4,A good movie guide,"I buy this guide each year, and I'm always satisfied. I typically agree with Martin & Porter's reviews. The only improvement I would make is to go back to listing titles by category (and including an alphabetical listing of titles index in the back). Sometimes I'm in the mood for a suspense, and in the past, I could just pop into that section and look for a 4- or 5-star entry. I really miss having that option. Other than that, this guide is excellent. Oh, and disregard the comment made by an earlier reviewer who couldn't find a listing of ""Starman."" Its 4-star entry is right there on page 1039."
1,A POOR BOOK WITH POOR REVIEWS,"This book is the WORST movie guide that I've seen in the last ten years. The guide gives one word reviews for ""TURKEY"" (bad movies)(POLICE ACADEMY 4) rated films and sometimes doesn't even give a review for TURKEY rated fims (POLICE ACADEMY 5). You can tell that half the time they take the sypnosis from the back of a video cover because they make the same errors (SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3: They said ""CAMP HAPPY WOODS"" and the camp actually is ""CAMP NEW HORIZONS""). They usually DON'T give the correct rating or EVEN the correct year or running time. So just use pure dumb luck to see what a video is like becuase I rate this guide ""TURKEY"""
2,No Starman??? Where has this writer been???,"Just ordered this book hoping that it would live up to the reviews. The first three movies I looked up that I have personally seen on video were not listed. What a disappointment! Example: Starman.. John Carpenter was listed under directors, Karen Allen was listed under actors as was Jeff Bridges( who was nominated for an Oscar for the film Starman), but alas no review of the film Starman. And there are other examples. Zorro...many inane versions were listed, but not the classic version with Tyrone Powers where he fights Basil Rathbone and marries Linda Darnell. I suppose TV watchers may appreciate this book, but I was watching great films 35 years before video came along, so as much as I appreciate reading some far out reviews, I will return this book in favor of one which is more comprenhesive to my age and interest group."
4,onegoodremix,"Milk and Sugar Radio Edit is the best one on this cd. The trance mixes that i've heard is much better.Trance Club Mix (9:29) Cool and lots of break and vocal samples, and has a long instrumental passage.Trance Dubby Dub (7:55) Awesome dub with almost no vocals at all. Great music and has a even longer instrumental passage.Trance Radio Mix (3:33) Short but just great."
1,Displeased with this Product,"The one click did not work . I tried severval times. I made sure it was downloaded right . To no avail it still did not work. I cannot delete it from my PC it will not let me. It has slowed down my PC . I have to put my PC in a shop to be fixed. Waste of time and money, More money than I paid from for my PC to be fixed.Very sorry I bought this."
1,Don't waste the time,"I tried really hard to get through this movie without falling asleep. I didn't succeed, so I tried again and fell asleep again. Yes, it's that bad. John C. Reilly is so unbelievable in the role of the vampire. The story makes no sense. What was the point? The ""good guys"" weren't even likeable. Real waste of time."
3,Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,The movie was okay mainly because I am a John C. Reilly fan. The movie just did not give any closure and left you wanting a little more...completion.
2,"Some neat ideas, but cheap","The problem with this movie is that the plot is so close to a ""Harry Potter""-y movie that you keep comparing it to it. But where ""Harry Potter"" has a great cast of actors in every role, ""Vampire's Assistant"" feels like they got a bunch of third and fourth choices for it. I love John C. Reilly in everything but thought he wasn't right here. The special effects were also pretty bad. You are so accustomed to even terrible movies like ""Golden Compass"" or ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" having big ""Avatar""-y effects that when you're doing the same kind of story and it looks like TV, it makes me LOL."
2,Cirque Du Waste,"This movie is a just a waste of time. From the trailer it looked like it had potential, it really did. However, the potential was so unfulfilled that I cannot communicate the extent of disappointment to you in this medium. The best way would be to sell you a ticket to some Broadway play and then lock you in your basement for three days. That would be as equivalent to the distance between the potential of this movie and what it delivered."
1,Not Good,"This is not a good movie. If you read the book and curious about the movie, it is not worth buying. Rent it or stream it for free from your video service if available, if you must see it."
1,Disappointed,"Though I haven't read the books, I've heard good reviews about them so I watched this film with high expectations, only to be disappointed. Overall, there is an interesting concept, but the storyline was a disaster and there was little/no character development. It seemed like they introduced too many characters at once and didn't have enough time to develop them at all, which is also why their relationships seem flat, and not to mention cliché. Also, I was thoroughly disappointed by the level of acting. Considering the books have a good name, I would've hoped they'd put more effort into casting and organizing the plot so a new audience would understand what was going on."
5,Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant.......,"I'm not familiar with the book series, truth be told, but probably will be in the near future after seeing this movie. Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant is the film adaptation of the first three books of the book series ""The Saga of Darren Shan"" by author Darren Shan. It tells the story of teenager Darren Shan(the authors' pen name)who mistakenly breaks a 100-year-old truce between two warring factions of vampires(the Vampanese & the Vampire Clan) and is pulled into the lives of misunderstood sideshow freaks.I wasn't expecting much out of this movie considering it's PG-13 but it ended up being a very entertaining movie that ranks up there with the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson movies.Even though this movie received mixed reviews when it was first released in theaters, I'm sure it will gain momentum and a fan base after people see this movie. I really liked it, and I'm finicky when it comes to Vampire flicks."
4,under rated,This movie never received much love at the box office but it 's a decent movie. A good Halloween movie with interesting characters.
4,BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE...TOO BAD WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE A SEQUEL! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I didn't have high expectations of this film when I sat down to watch it, but I found myself really enjoying this teen vampire flick. The film pays homage to many vampire films from the past and the cast and story are involving enough to keep you interested. I could see nod to Fright Night and The Lost Boys and many other vampire films. John C. Reilly seemed an odd choice for the role of a vampire, but he works very well and his odd appearance makes the film even more interesting. I can't give this film a full 4 stars because it is one of those serial type films. Unfortunately this film didn't do well at the box office and it is doubtful that we will se a part two any time soon......too bad because this film blows away any of the Twilight films by a mile and that series looks like it will go on forever! AAHHHHHHH ;-E"
3,Bridget's Review,"This movie was OK. Nothing spectacular but it didn't suck either. I can't quite decide which way to go on this, so I'll say 3 stars."
2,teen only film,Although its full of great actors its a teen film and will Bore anyone over 16its got a good script so I hung in there till the end.
1,Oh jeeze...,"OMG after sitting thorough 15 mins of it I couldn't take it anymore after I found out that weird french-looking creep was Gavner... omg and the ""wolfman""..I'm a huge fan of the Cirque du Freak series by Darren Shan, but this movie makes the entire thing look like a poor joke..... there were so many flaws of the events and the characters were off quiet a bit :\Seriously, don't watch it; it's a waste of time and money."
2,Vampire's...,"The T.V. trailers for this made it look good but I got lost to often.I watched it to the end to see if I could figure it out w/ no luck, it was very choppy. The story was all over the place, no flow or reason why things were going the way they were. The relationships between the main players, vampire / assistant, boy / monkey girl and school best friend didn't make sense to me."
2,JWVHIII,This movie did not live up to the trailer's promise. It was an expensive production with lame special effects and a story that went nowhere. The mutants were boring. Save your time and money.
2,It's boring even though some of the special effects are interesting,"- The trailer is intriguing but the movie is not.- Some of the special effects are eye catching but they're the only good things in this film.- There's no fun, no suspense, no horror and no drama. It seems the director does not know what kind of movies he wanted it to be. In short, I got no feeling watching it.- I regret spending money to watch it in the theatre."
2,Ehh...,"I'm around the target age for this movie and I like the idea of vampires (I read twilight series and a lot of fantasy/vampire books) but I've never read this book series. I assume that the ending was so abrupt and 'lame' because this is the first book of a series just to get it started. However, unlike a book series, you would have to either go out and read the series to see if this goes anywhere, or wait however long it takes for the next movie to come out (if they're making a new one...). Overall, I thought the plot was lame and the ending a disappointment. I would say more but it might be a spoiler if you're about to watch the movie. My opinion? If you're around the target young-adult/ teen age and read twilight but not this particular series? Don't bother."
1,Pitiful,"No more need be said; the story is lame and predictable, the characters are ill-defined and the lead is forgetable, illogical, and, worst of all, wimpy."
2,Not Real Good.,"This is just a time killer. It wasn't terribly interesting. The plot was one you could fill in the next scenes. Don't waste your money or time on this one. It isn't going to be one you will watch again or even wantfinish. Until next time so long.Thecountrygirl,Judy"
2,Not suitable for anything.,This neither makes it as a shock movie or a thinking piece. I realize that this is for a teen market. I don't think the people who made this movie knew that. I can enjoy most teen marketed movies in this genre. I was frankly bored.
4,Nice Change of Pace,I thought this movie brought a fresh view of your typical vampire movie. Somewhat lighthearted and definately worth a look. I judge movies that I would buy and I bought this movie with no regrets.
4,Cirque Du Freak,This is a really fun movie which to me is suitable for a late pre-teen.Language and sexual content is appropriate for that age. There is some violence butno real bloodshed.As always I would recommend you view it first.My granddaughter who is 12 absolutely loves it. We have since bought the firstof the books to see is she wants to continue with the series.
5,BRILLIANTLY FUN!,"The Movie was way better than New Moon that sucked a lot! Awesome movie with lots and lots of Action! The Movie has lots of Mild Language but in a funny way though, It's one of the best Horror Comedy Movies of This Year!"
5,I did't know what I was missing!,"Really, I didn't. My computer had an onboard video and I recently decided to upgrade the sytem memory from @GB to 3 GB. While inside I remembered about this on board memory when I saw the vacant video slot.I thought that it was an AGP only to realise after investigation that it was a PCI-e. I had aprevious XFX (AGP) and it perfomed really well, so I went with the same brand with more memory.The videos are breathtaking. I resurrected CIV 4, Empire Earth, etc and there was a stunning difference. They used to crawl at low resolutions before but now I crank them up to the max and the games flow smoothly with breathtaking detail.Crsytal clear pictures..lovely! I really did not knopw what I was missing before. Applications even seem to open faster, the Internet etc but the real difference is seen with videos, pictures and games!A great buy!"
1,JUST A GOOD LOOK!,"I just got this one as a gift. It looks good for semi-transparent hard case but it fails. Upper plastic rim by the home button is very flimsy. Plastic along the side is so hard that it's almost impossible for me to take case off the phone. In short, I'd NOT recommend this product."
2,Is it live or is it Musicraft?,"Beware, this deceptively titled album is no obscure Ellington concert recording. It is instead comprised of all but two of the studio recordings done by Ellington for the small Musicraft label in 1946. However, that information is contained nowhere in the nearly worthless liner notes included with this product. Serious Ellington fans will certainly want to obtain the Musicraft recordings as they come from a period where the Duke was otherwise unrecorded in the studio and he and Strayhorn were engaged in serious efforts at stretching the accepted conventions of their art form. If it can be found at an affordable price, an infinitely better choice would beHappy-Go-Lucky Local. Failing that, you'd presumably still fare better withComplete Musicraft Recordings."
2,Put this movie to a good use,"My overall impression of this movie was very uneven. Some of the actings and dialogues were great and poignant, others were flat and unconvincing. I could think of one way of putting this movie to good use, i.e. show the last scene to the evangelists and those who believe that sex between the same sex (homosexuality) is a choice. After they see it, they will think differently."
1,Not worth watching,The idea of watching two straight men making love can be luring. But director of this movie turn it into something quite disgusting.There is not a single moment in this film that made me laugh. Both of the main characters are everything but appealing and their lack of aibility to act doesn't help either. The actress who plays wife of one of the men got on my nerves too.In my opinion to watch it was a loss of time and money.
2,"Don't. Stop. Don't! Stop! No, just stop.","Stupid and pointless. These manly men hem and haw over should they or shouldn't they - and clearly from the get-go the answer is no. In fact - the wife should just dump both of them and change the locks. But then we'd miss all the hair tugging, face rubbing, circularly unlogical discourse and terribly heavy thinking over to have sex or not. Down to the essential ""this is the most terrifying thing we've over done in our lives."" Really? A sexual Everest or an elephant in the room... whichever, neither wants to be mounted. The only true exposing moment comes right at the close... when the one friend is sitting in the hotel room by himself playing back the evening which was taped on a camcorder."
1,I wish i could give less than 1 star,This is about the most useless and unentertaining movie I have ever seen. It opens with and interesting premise and goes absoultely nowhere... slowly.I have rarely watched a movie without finding something redeeming. This is one of those times.
5,"Comments on DVD ""Humpday""","It's a little hard to believe that because of a dare, grown men would feel compelled to star in a skin flick! I suspect that deep down they wanted to do the skin flick but needed an excuse to ""cover"" their underlying motivation. Regardless of that, it's an entertaining film."
2,slow,"Starts slow, goes slow, ends slow. The acting is 'organic', but not enough to carry a really dull film. I was disappointed."
1,"Nice Piece, But Very Overpriced","This is a nice piece of jewelry, but as is the case with all the ""by Zina"" jewelry, it's very, very overpriced. Quality-wise, this piece of jewelry is no better or worse than similar pieces I've bought, for half the price or less. I've found a few similar pendant designs, for much cheaper, and I guarantee the quality is the same. There's no valid reason for these ""by Zina"" inflated prices."
2,"Chaotic story, flimsy plot","The book was just as bad. I hoped for an interesting old, black and white movie but it was hard to watch the whole thing."
1,Worst electronic purchase ever! Stay away for Toshiba!,"I had the same problem with this unit that many people have had, Disc Errors, Mech. Errors, you name it, of course all this started a couple months after the one-year warranty. I wrote Toshiba's headquarters and enclosed copies of dozens of complaints from other websites to ask them if they considered this a known problem. I will not pay for repair of product where dozens, probably hundreds of people are having the same trouble. Anyway, they called two weeks later and said there was nothing they can do. Well, I figured out how to (sometimes) get the disk to play; bang the DVD player up and down very hard and loudly, about ten times, and you might get the LOADIING message. Soon I will chuck this p.o.s. over the balcony after burning $... and never buy ANYTHING from Toshiba."
2,SD-3205 -- Finicky and Trouble-prone,"We've had this unit for about a year and a half. I agree with the complaints regarding trying to get a disc OUT. I finally figured out the pushing STOP button twice would do it.My biggest problem is getting DISC ERROR when inserting a DVD or CD. This is happening with increasing frequency - probably about half of the DVDs we rent will not play at all. And many of my CDs ,which are in very good condition will not play either.The Owner's Manual is useless in troubleshooting this problem, as it doesn't bother to mention it. I suspect it will have to go into the shop.I will not buy another Toshiba product, based on our experience with this unit."
1,Same Problems,"I had this unit for about 2 years, and after playing a VCD for the first time, it lost it's mind. Lots of green and red blocks on the screen. After that, I get the (apparently famous) Insert Disk message, and it won't play anything (DVD, CD, VCD, etc). I expect my consumer electronics to last longer than 24 months."
1,Insert Disk Error,"At least received near 3 years of use, but received the famous insert disk error on any CD and DVD. Similar as many reported on numerous sites. Stay away from Toshiba."
4,Happy to have it!,"I did a lot of research before buying, and I'm very happy with my decision. I was going to try to get a PS2, but decided to get this instead (since there was no way I would get the PS2!). The set up is simple, and the playback is great! The audio is incredible, and the features live up to the reputation. I've only had a couple of glitches, like trying to skip tracks and the machine won't respond unless the button is pressed several times. Other than that, most of the little things are fixed by reading the manual and learning the machine. I would recommend this to a friend or family member, it's a great deal, works great playing multiple discs, and has made me want to get a new reciever and speakers which can keep up with it!"
1,"Ate first disk, Wouldn't release second","Opened my brand new unit, put in two DVDs, opened the unit to see which DVD was in slot 1; nothing was there! Nothing was in slot 2; eventually took cover off, removed circuit boards and retrieved disk 1, from back corner of machine where the platter had slung it. After repeated efforts pushing buttons, a good five minutes, it disgorged disk 2. Find this same problem in reviews of other Toshiba units, wish I had read first."
3,Give Me Back My Disc!!!,"I bought, I tried, I returned. I don't think people have stressed enough the fact that removing a disc from this machine can be real frustrating. Why should it be frustrating just to remove a disc from the player? Terrible design flaw from Toshiba. Otherwise, the DVD player seemed excellent. I bought unit to replace a 5-disc CD changer, but I think I will buy a single disc DVD and a new CD changer. This unit was particularly finicky about the type of CD-R's that it would play. Therefore, not a good choice for replacing a CD changer IMHO. I may buy the Toshiba SD2200 because the video, menu system, remote etc... was all fine on the SD3205 player. This unit (and the SD2200) also needs a second set (it has only one) of analog audio outputs - one for TV one for A/V reciever."
5,Terrific and white-knuckling!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd, it was one that you dont want to walk away from during viewing! Each moment seems to be a white knuckle-erIt depicts some very harrowing actual hostage accounts of the past, where time is of the essence and the most intellegint minds are pushed to the limits to beat the clock to figure out what they have going on, who they are dealing with, and where and when the best vantage point is to take out the combatants to save multiple innocent lives. There is an elementary school takeover, a passenger train takeover, and the infamous Luftansa plane takeover. This is a video that is great to watch again and again, and a great video for entertaing guests too."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great CD- very soft, very sweet! Many romantic songs, but with lots of energy as well! Fabulous!"
4,Un clásico,Compré este disco porque es un clásico y me trae muchísimos recuerdos. Es múscia fresca y divertida.
2,"Good writer, bad plot&#65533;","I really do believe that M. T Anderson is a good writer, and you see glimpses of this in this book. Those few glimpses aren't enough to pull this mixed-up plot of feuding fast-food chains, bullies and love into a coherent, entertaining novel. Anthony, who caught his girlfriend cheating on him with a guy (Turner) that works at the local fast-food joint, O'Dermott's, decides he should work there too to get ""revenge"" on Turner. Anthony's crazy ideas end up getting him in some very odd situations, none which reflect very well on his employer. Just...blah..."
4,"good, but","i enjoyed this book however, i found the dialouge disruptive, ie the repetitive use of the word like, it broke up the story lines because the author wasnt exactly sure where to put them, and dont get me wrong, im fifteen and i liked the story but, the like thing..."
2,STARTS GOOD AND FADES,"This book has a good starting. After about 20 pages, it totally flops. I usually like books like these but I was totally surprised by the rest of it. PLEASE STAY AWAY. I suggest Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snoggings in replace for a good laugh. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BORING BOOK."
3,Burger Wuss,"Burger Wuss is a great book. It has a great plot of how Anthony tries to get revenge on Turner, his worst enemy, because he stole his girlfriend. He has a very sophisticated plan that he has been planning for a while to get revenge on Turner. It's all a matter of execution. Meanwhile, he is working at a burger restaurant with Turner, while Turner is trying to get him fired. Most importantly, he has to prove to everyone that he is not a wuss. Burger Wuss is the funniest book that I have ever read. It's the kind of book that makes you want to keep reading because you want to know what happens next. Although it's a great book, I wouldn't really recommend it for any one under the age of 13. Sometimes his thoughts and dreams get a little too descriptive and there is a bloody fight scene."
3,A quick read,"This book is about Anthony, who gets a job at a fast food place, to win back the girlfriend he's lost and get revenge on the guy she cheated on him with. Anthony is a great main character--very real. He's incredibly awkward, yet his sense of humor was great (it's too bad no one in the book thought so), and his plot for revenge was believeable. He doesn't seem to have any real friends, and not very much luck at his new job, and I felt bad for him. This wasn't an easy book to read, in the sense that the events that happen to Anthony are pretty realistic and definitely don't have that movie-style happy ending. It's not very many pages, so it's a quick read, and I think, once again, Anderson has created a relatable, likeable character."
4,Teenage Book,I read this book and I liked it a pretty lot. It's filled with everthing from fights to friendship. I would reccomend this book to any teen who is looking for a non-action book.
2,Silly and simple,"Anthony takes a job at O'Dermott's fast food restaurant for one reason only: to gain revenge on fellow employee Turner, who stole his girlfriend. In a convoluted, goofy series of events, Anthony engages his anti-corporate co-worker, Shunt, and his two love-crazy friends, Rick and Jennifer. Together, they hatch a plot to frame Turner for the theft of a rival restaurant's condiment troll and humiliate him in front of everyone. This novel may appeal to some readers because of its fast-paced plot and humor, but I thought it was uninspired and boring. Although the writer has some moments of voice and a few clever ideas, the plot is rather thin, and the complete lack of seriousness makes the characters seem unrealistic and difficult to believe. Too many bathroom joke add ot the gross-out factor and make the story even harder to respect. Low-level high school readers and perhaps middle-schoolers will find this novel entertaining."
3,"A quick, semi humorous read","I found this book a nice, quick read to uplift your spirits, but if you are looking for a book that has depth, I don't suggest one. If you liked this book, you'll most definitely like Feeling Sorry for Celia, by Jaclyn Moriarty. Both are written in a simple type of language, that portray real teenagers. Also, if you liked those two books, you might like Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging, along with the rest of that series. I personally did not find Georgia Nicholson funny at all, but most seem to enjoy her books."
4,Burger Wuss,Burger Wuss is about a kid who likes this girl and they become boyfriend and girlfriend but this other guy that used to work at the fast food resturant steals his girl at a party and the make out. The kid wants his revenge but does not know how. Read this awsome book to find out what the Burger Wuss does to gain his revenge.
2,boring,i didnt read the whole book probably only up to page 80 and it was pretty boring. not very challenging and barely any rising action but i didnt read the whole thing maybe it got better.anyways the 1st 80 pages i read had some boring flashbacks little humor and no vocabulary
1,Stupid,"This book was boring, it was written at a young reading level. I quit reading in the middle. I don't reccomend this book for anyone 8th grade or over."
4,Good Phone - But missing features,"I have had the phone for about a month now and it has worked fine so far. It has great range (I have went up the street and to my neighbors house and still recieved calls). It only has one little problem of a slight ring/reverb when you talk coming out of the speaker after you have been using the phone for 5 or 10 minutes, this can get annoying sometimes.My only complaint about the phone is that it has no Mute or hold button. With all of the other features this phone has, I don't know why this was not included."
2,Difficult to dial,"While this phone has many good features like the Caller ID stack and the voice mail light, it is very difficult to dial. The echo back of the tone when you hit a key is delayed which is very confusing and the buttons sometimes don't register the tone at all. These are enough to make me wish I would've bought a different phone. I should've trusted to the other bad reviews of this phone."
3,Panasonic Phone Generally Acceptable,"I must say that the Panasonic KXTG2560 2.4 GHz DSS Cordless Phone with Caller ID & Dual Keypad is a step up from my previous cordless phones. It does have a couple of areas that I feel could use improvements. The claim of up to eight hours of in-use time of this phone is way overrated. It comes no where near that time for me. Secondly, I find the keypads stiff to use as well as the feature of deleting stored phone numbers. I would love for it to have backup batteries available also. I do like that fact that I can replace the headset when it goes bad and the ability to adjust the volume. Overall, it's the best one I've had so far."
2,Static and crackle,"I had this phone for just over a year. I liked the features such as the LCD screen to display a directory and built in answering machine, but the problems are bad. Besides off and on problems, like not always getting a dialtone when the phone is removed from the base, I started to encounter bad static problems. These would occur if I was only standing 2 feet away from the base. The person on the other end could not ever hear the static so it is a transmittal problem between the base and handset. It is even worse if any appliances are working, especially the microwave. I purchased a 2.4GHz because I thought that a different transmittal range would give great clarity. Well, I now have a phone that is 2 months out of warranty and is unuseable. Stick with a quality 900 MHz phone at a fraction of the price and you will be much happier. I am now using my 4 year old phone."
1,"This phone is not Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS), just SS","I bought this phone because I was looking for DSS, Digital Spread Spectrum. I tried another Panasonic DSS phone that worked well and I bought this one for my home office. When I received this and tried to use it, it interfered heavily with my personal home phone. Checking the box and the specifications, it is not DSS as listed on Amazon.I don't care that this review gets posted, I would prefer that you change the name of the product on your site. The phone is probably fine for somebody that wants an analog phone."
5,Underrated,I think that this phone is underrated in its reviews on amazon. I think that people expect to much from phones in the present day. This phone actually works just as good as any phone and would be a good buy.
2,Sticky buttons and Out of Range errors,"I have had this phone about a year and I have already experienced several ""out of range"" errors on the handset while I am within two feet of the base unit. This is really frustrating along with the extreme amount of pressure it takes to push the buttons, which sometimes results in double digits getting pushed by accident. Also, wish there was a redial button and everyone who uses it pushes the intercom button to end the call which makes a loud beeping noise. So obviously pushing the talk button to hang up the phone is not the normal procedure nor is it very popular with my friends who can not seem to get the hang of it, pardon the pun.I will give the phone a thumbs up for clarity and distance as well as battery talk time. But overall I am disappointed in this Panasonic product. Wait, come to think of it I never liked Panasonic stereo equipment either. Hmmm, I wonder if Pioneer makes telephones."
1,Poorly Designed -- Stay Away,"Here is why I rate this phone so poorly:1. Hard to use number pad. The ""press"" action requires significant pressure and the surface is slippery as well. So, I often end up dialing the same digit twice. I call many different international numbers and it is so frustrating to redial 15 digits again. :(2. The User Interface of the entire software (Redial, Memory, Directory, etc.) is very poorly designed. It does not even have a ""redial"" button.3. I often hear crackle in the signal. (Although this could be me wireless router interfering with the signal).I was very happy with my previous Panansonic phones. But never again I am buying one without actually getting a hands-on experience with the phone. This seems to be a growing trend with electronics these days - prices are falling and quality is getting worse. I would advise you to stay away from this model."
1,Giga-STATIC,"This phone is digital at its worst. If I move while using the phone the static will interupt my conversation, even when in the same room as the base set. In addition, the base speakerphone is barely audible at full volume. I'm going back to V-Tech."
1,Pricey for something disposable,I bought one last March it lasted about 3 months. It became staticy and would say it was out of range when near the base unit. I traded it in for the same model and the same thing stated happening about 4 months later. Neither were at all mistreated.
4,Just right.,"The color is just subtle enough, and the product came well-packaged and undamaged. It also got here in just a couple of days!"
3,you get what you pay for,"I purchased these wipes because they were cheap and showed the cotton symbol on the box...I received them and I now understand why they're so cheap. There's not a whole lot of wetness to them and they're kind of thin and stretchy. I prefer my baby wipes to not be translucent and have some substance to them. I like to be able to use one wipe at a time, not doubling up on the wipes to avoid getting feces or urine on my hands. On the up side, they do have a nice lavender scent, they are soft, and the box is refillable. I would suggest using these to clean up messes on hands, faces and wet diapers...not for use on poopy bottoms."
3,"Average, wont order again","I bought these because they were supposed to have a lavender scent. They are scented, buts its just that standard baby wipe smell. The texture is nice, the wipes are strong, and they are average thickness. The tubs are fine, but Huggies tubs are far better."
1,This phone...,"I've owned this phone for about 2 weeks now and I HATE it! I live in a high rise, and I actually had to dig out an old corded phone and plug it into the wall because I was getting so many complaints from the people I was talking to about buzzing on my phone. It gets static all the time; the buttons on the handset are poorly designed so that if I try to hold it on my shoulder I disconnect myself half the time; the caller ID re-dial doesn't work properly; and on and on...."
4,ozrics need more live discs,"The Ozrics haven't released a live album with their most recent line-up (except for the out of print Spice Doubt), which is too bad since Rad (their latest drummer) has left the band. Merv plays drums on this disc and the drumming isn't quite up to the standard of recent albums like The Hidden Step and Become the Other. Otherwise, this is a great live album with superior versions of tunes from Strangitude, Pungent Efflugent and Erpland (among others). Lots of jamming, perhaps too much at times, and little of the techno/rave stuff, which will be pleasing for some fans, disapointing for others."
4,A Great Opener,"This is one of my favorite Ozric CDs. The opening track ""Dots"" or ""Dots Thots"" has a great guitar rhythm that sets the tone of the CD. The guitarist, Ed Wynne is one of those great guitarists that most people never hear. He has a knack of making delay effects sound awesome. Plus, he is a great soloist. The Dots track also reminds me of the theme song from Lost in Space. ""Oh dear William!"""
1,Focal length not adjustable,We have been using similar lenses that have a comfortable focal length of approx12-14 inches. This lens and stud lenghth combination are much to short and we have to work at 6-8 inches from our patient - not comfortable - the focal length could be made to easily adjust solving the problem
2,"Hey,This BAND has the CUTTING EDGE !!!","This is a great horror/ music hybrid film.This band of has-beens is giving one last chance to record THE Album of all albums,In a studio that may be haunted by ex-band members or someone from their past.Knives,Lots of knives are used to reduce the number of band members for the comeback cd .There is a music video director who is his own cameraman and turns out may be chronicling the groups `piercing' melodies.Great British cast who are incredibly believable in unbelievable situations, And beware the sounds that Are'nt `Britains Got Talent' Alumnai !"
2,NBC Lite,"If you're looking for a big, happy coffee table book about what a terrific network NBC is, ""Brought to You in Living Color"" will meet your needs. If, however, you're expecting actual information (ratings? dates? a comprehensive list of shows? interviews?), as I was, this content-starved book will only make you shake your fist and curse the all-powerful National Broadcasting Network. It's as if the NBC publicity department is offering you a big bowl of jellybeans ... colorful and tempting, to be sure, but ultimately unsatisfying."
2,This book almost sent me running back to heterosexuality.,"What an awful book! Yes, it is witty in some places, but this is nothing more than some light weight humor that depicts an awfully bad light on being a gay man. Outland states that sex is a must by the second date and the overlying tone of the whole book is that sex is what it's all about. In a book about finding ""Mr. Right,"" I'd expect something about relationships. Seriously, save your money - the Patrick Price book on relationships/gay marriage is much better, more amusing, and yet full of real world advice that might actually work without the stupd gimmicks and movie-principles Outland talks about."
4,Excellent CD for Lamarque beginners,"This is an excellent copilation specially for those that do not have anything else by Lamarque. It's a good way to start since the selection of songs is representative of the wide range of the artist's repertoire... Libertad sings boleros, caribbean rhythms, Latin folklore and everything else with the same brillance as the tangos that made her famous. Here you will find her dramatic rendition of ""Historia de un Amor"", the curious blending of Puerto Rican-Argentinian feeling in ""En Mi Viejo San Juan"", the deliciously funny ""O""...the immortal ""Cuando Vuelva A Tu Lado""; every song on this CD is a gem and the digital transfer is pretty decent for BMG Latin. Who could ask for anything more?"
3,Better than Average Christmas Anthology,"MISS MONTRACHET REQUESTS by Marua SegerMiss Cornelia Montrachet requests the pleasures of your company at a Victorian Christmas in 1892 New York, wherein the ""Queen of the Penny Dreadfuls"" plays unexpected Cupid with unforgettable results....CHRISTMAS BOUNTY by Erin YorkeBlair Duncan told herself she was no longer interested in the wealthy neighbor who had broker her heart years before - but as Christmas approached, she uncovered a mystery in her tiny village, and she suspected he was behind it!A PROMISE KEPT by Bronwyn WilliamsWhen Sara Jones knocked a Yankee soldier unconscious in her own kitchen one December night, she couldn't believe her eyes. Her dead husband had returned. Yet, was this kind, loving mand the same coldhearted spouse Sara remembered...or was he truly a Christmas miracle?"
4,"Detractors, step off...","First off, let's deal with all those nitwits out there who've got Belle & Sebastian pegged as some kind of sacred cow; if we're gonna play 'name that influence', then this review will be a thousand times longer than it needs to be, and I won't even get around to reviewing the actual LP!Besides, this has some of the best songs Petula Clark never wrote. Particularly ""A Sister's Social Agony"", one of the best (and few) doo-wop-esque ditties I've heard since The Flamingoes.The album starts off great, with ""Suspended From Class"", ""Keep It Clean"", ""A Sister's..."", and ""Teenager"", lulls a bit in the middle (minus a star for re-writing L. Cohen's ""Suzanne"" and calling it ""Your Picture""; shame on you guys), then picks up a bit near the end.For those in need of a chill pill fix, this'll do the trick."
3,history 101,"people do need to remember that B&S themselves owe a huge debt to Scottish musicians such as Donovan, as well as bands such as Love (from whom they got massive amounts of musical ideas, i.e. every horn arrangement they've done) in terms of sound and structure. that doesn't make them derivative, however. just more in a long line of excellent quietish chamber pop bands from the British Isles. that said, i agree with both sides, really. there are flashes of brilliance here, but at the same time it can get a bit too B&Sy for its own good. so, not a masterpiece, but not a complete waste, either."
5,Camera obscura,"Underachievers please try harder is one of those albums that make you feel good from beginning to end. The melodies and harmonies are perfect. I could go on and on about how good it is but I will say this, Buy it and listen a few times. You will feel the whole album envelope you."
3,"Camera Obscura, Please Try Harder","This is a marvolous album, but having head Camera Obscura's debut LP, Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi, i'm just a little bit dissapointed. This CD has some great songs, 'books written for girls', 'keep it clean', and 'you're picture' but the over all quality of the CD just isn't as good as their first. I've read the other reviews bashing Camera Obscura from sounding too much like Belle and Sebastian and i really don't think that's fair. Sure, they do sound a lot alike, but there are distict differences. Much of pop music is similar anyways."
3,"Some solid songs, some... well...","Okay, so Belle & Sebastian can't put out nearly as many albums as I'd like them to (about one every six months would be best). Camera Obscura isn't quite as slavish an imitator as other reviews would have it, but they're at their best when they ""cover"" B&S. Some of the songs on this CD, though, are just wretched (""A Sister's Social Agony,"" ""Teenager,"" ""Before You Cry""); it's a good thing they invented the ""next track"" command. However, when they're good, they're pretty damned good. Overall, I'd recommend this CD, but just know that there's a big dead chunk o' real estate in the middle."
3,Der!!,"Der!! To all who bag the group as ripping off Belle And Sebastien, you might note that Stuart Murdoch actually produced this album! Anyhow, B&S are pretty derivative anyway."
2,bor-ing,"this CD sounds like they bought one of those big yellow dummies books, in this case ""Art For Dummies"" and figured they'd get plucking away at some song ideas. All the standard cliches are here in the lyrics, and the music sounds totally like they just wish they were Belle and Sebastian. Just think Belle and Sebastian but more boring. Artistically, this CD has nothing to say, it just rehashes cliches. The title alone ""La Camera Obscura"" is annoying, its a good tip-off for what's inside. Like a high-schooler's notion of writing a poem's title in Spanish to make it more poetic and, ""like, so deep."" And obscure. But there isn't much soul here in the lyrics, just vague arty notions and recycled indie aesthetic. And the album cover with the hipster girl looking bitter and constipated on the left is just silly."
2,The Greatest Hit collection,"Why would you buy a greatest hits collection for a band that were ""One album wonders"" If you buy their first album you will have the best of The Knack."
3,Good Deal,"The video was pretty good, it's very straightforward. If your familiar with basic martial arts strikes you should have no problems, and he explains pretty well so beginners should be fine too. I do think it lacks in explanation of internal energy cultivation and projection, so having some internal energy experience would be beneficial to the user. If your just looking to get tough hands, this video will do it!"
3,details lack crispness,On line the earrings look as though they had small beads circling the stones and it looked well defined. With the actual earrings the details were less than crisp and precise. The stones look smaller on the earrings and the actual earrings are slightly over sized for my taste.
3,stakes not wedges,"These are 2"" X 12"" wedge shaped stakes. I am still looking for 4"" wide by 12"" wedges.These are commonly called miners wedges."
3,"""Maisie"" was better","Critics will often pair this novel with his earlier ""What Maisie Knew.""Both novels deal with the child's / adolescent's emerging conscience, while faced with adult corruption.In ""Maisie"" and ""Awkward,"" we see James following up on his fascination with Hawthornian themes.James's facility with dialogue, in which abrupt blushes are loaded with meaning, is apparent here. The drawing-room conversations reminded me of a party in a swimming pool; each character is constantly, in a conversational sense, ""taking a plunge and coming up somewhere else.""I found this novel somewhat thin - read closely James's ""Preface to the New York Edition""; can you hear James in self-defense mode?Overall, not bad, but ""Maisie's"" somber and gloomy tone was better suited to the subject matter and themes than the ""light and ironic"" touch of ""Awkward."""
4,Very nice backpack,"I used this bag for 3 years in law school and carried all my books and laptop back and forth nearly everyday (often biking or walking to school). The back cushioning is great and extra thick and makes carrying heavy books more bearable. One of the zippers busted off, but this was probably due to my own carelessness. Fairly stylish in my opinion too. Only downside is that capacity is somewhat limited if your laptop is in it. I can't vouch for how it handles in a downpour, but I have gotten the bag wet and the contents were fine. Recommended."

5,Fiamm El Grande Twin Horns,Excellent value. I installed these on my car. Easy installation. Huge difference in stock horn volume. Hear them on You Tube.
5,Fiamm Loud Horns for Motorcycle,Wanted some louder horns for the motorcycle that didn't draw too much power.They work great compared to the 30 y/o OEM ones.
4,Definite safety improvement for motorcycles!,"These definitely sound like a 1975 Cutlass Supreme. I'd like them even a litttle louder, but compared to stock motorcycle horns, they are light-years better. Plug your existing horn wires into the relay (# 85 and 86) Run a direct line off the battery and through a fuse to #30 and a direct line to the horns off the 2 #87s on the Fiamm relay. It may be a little difficult to find space for the horns if you want them out of sight. I put the relay at the OEM horn site- the wires are right there- then made a bracket from some galvanized lumber patch plate, which grounds them.The cagers will know that you're there!"
4,Nice sound,"This horn set made a nice replacement for the weak meep-meep beeper that came stock in my Nissan Leaf. Now it has a clear authoritative sound like a large American car. Current draw for the pair is 10 amps, the same as the stock horn fuse, so I didn't have to install a relay. Just unbolted the old horn and bolted these on, and made a pigtail jumper to connect both horns to the existing single wire.Be sure to install with the horn mouths facing downwards so that any splashed rainwater can drain out."
2,Only one spade connector,"Be careful, it is not made clear in the product description that these horns only have one spade connector lug. So, if you have two wires (positive & negative) you can not use these horns unless your entire chassis functions as a ground."
1,good for 2 weeks,Good for only 2 weeks and stop working I am mad with it you buy something and not good that first I love it now only the low tone works this is tresh don't buy this
3,good in the first week,It was good for 2 weeks now only one horn works I will change for a other horn but a diff brand
5,No more beep beep,"I am very pleased with the purchase to delivery time.I received yesterday and installed today 4/10/12.... I am Impressed! no more beep beep.. More like Brap Brap!! Now I can be heard and not have my 16 year old son say; Daddy please don't honk that thing.... Hahahaha. Installation was quite simple, had two wires used the hot wire and grounded the horn to the body, just for security I also attached the 'extra' wire to the cbody also.."
4,Two Horns Are Better Than One! Fiamm 74100 El Grande,"Length:: 0:01 MinsFIAMM 74100 El Grande - Twin Horns - RedBought a new Honda Civic, and while I love the car, the 'meep meep' Roadrunner emulation the car makes for a horn is a bit pathetic and an ego deflater for those of us accustomed to louder, dual horns on GM and other such products. So, I added a set of Fiamm 74100 horns, and the harmony and depth is about what I wanted. Sure, they could be louder... but in a driving rain I suspect the guy about to turn will hear me now! A safety as well as pride thing... I have a brief file of what they sound like and may post a 'how to' video on how to do this (it is easy but takes a little time) for those who have just purchased a 2012 Civic. Older Civics are slightly different, but the effect would be the same.Write me and I can give you some installation details, and play the attached file of what these horns actually sound like when installed."
5,Good and loud!,"After 30 years, Fiamm is still making great horns: loud and shrill! The package comes with just about everything one might need to do the install (except for miscellaneous electrical things like spade connectors etc.): relay (though most vehicles probably won't need it, 'cause most vehicles these days have a horn relay controlling their OEM horn) ring connectors, straps and nuts. Installation should be straightforward for someone with average mechanical and electrical knowledge and skill."
4,Great little horns,"I bought this horn set, to replace the weak horn on my wife's Scion Xb. The installation was easy, behind the front grill filler panel. And the stock horn relay had no problem driving the two horns. It now sounds like a full size GM car. I'm very pleased."
2,"it's the best out there, but ...","My MiniJam has crashed my Visor Handspring Platinum several times (any time I select ""Playlist"", for example), and when I asked Customer Support, was told that ""a software release is scheduled for today, but as of my last check it hasn't been posted.""Also, it doesn't work when your PDA has gone into sleep mode, requiring you to stop in your tracks, turn it back on, futz with the stylus, and then operate the MiniJam controls if you want to adjust the volume, skip a track, etc. The MiniJam is really nice to work out or just walk around with, but it sure needs a helluva upgrade."
5,Perfect Color For Me,I first saw this color in a nail salon. I wrote down the name and looked it up online and to my surprise actually found it. It's hard to beat OPI polish for longevity and wear & tear..I'm not 'easy' with my nails. It was a bit pricey BUT for the end results...I've no problem paying the price.
3,Colour not the same,Although there is nothing wrong with the product it is the colour that is the issue. It doesn't look in reality anything like the on-line photo. In the photo it is a nice light mauve colour in reality it is more of a pinky red colour. Hard to describe really but definitely not the colour you see on screen. Not the colour I was expecting but still a good product never the less. Just a shame really as I really liked the colour shown
5,"This is so far, Sabina's best title","I have been a fan of Sabina's music for over 8 years and I can say that this album marks his best moment as a songwriter and singer. All songs are impressive, daring and all of them reach people's souls. Sabina is a singer with a very subtle sense of humor and that irony that portrays society as it is: a jungle.Since I heard Fisica y Quimica for the first time, I fell for his music, and really hope you do, too."
2,Item I received is different than what is pictured,The SF keychain I received looks completely different than the item I ordered. The one pictured looks metal and the ring is attached to the side. What I received is rubber and the ring comes off the top. Definitely not worth the money I paid.
3,poor adhesive,"tape is sturdy and arrived quickly but this is a low-tack adhesive for sure. additionally, the material is thin enough that you can see through to whatever it's on - not what i was hoping for."
1,Does not stick to anything,"I got this to mark off a section of the dance floor for A bouncer to stand, didn't stick so we were going to use it on the metal railing So people stop running into it, again it didn't stick. So last we were going to try to stick it to a wooden beam and AGAIN IT DIDN'T STICK! Useless."
5,Great Socks!!,"Even though the Ravens didn't win against Indy, these socks were a great deal!! I like being able to support both the Ravens and Breast Cancer Awareness. They're cute and comfortable!!"
3,The Bible and Its Influence,"This text would be much improved if each chapter would describe what the purpose of the chapter was. This text should be able to stand on its own without the instructor intervention and it doesn't. I found that for this text to be successful much prereading, concurent reading of other sources was needed or a strong foundation in Bible knowlege already present. It was difficult for me who is a Masters prepared."
3,Too fancy for a Textbook,"The material is well presented, photos and text are excellent. It seems to me that the book should not have been presented as a coffee table book - over size and slick paper - but rather as a standard textbook. Could that change reduced the price?"
1,OK.... but,"So when do the school boards also provide textbooks from the other major religions of the world and of other citizens of the US? Seems to be very one-sided unless these other books are in the works. Oh and by the way. How about something that talks about the 14,000,000 citizens of the US who have NO RELIGION at all? How about talking about their contributions to our society as well?D.Walters, AZ"
3,Poor Construction of the Book,"This is a great book as a beginning understand of the Bible and its influence. But, the company that contructed the book did an extremely poor job. We sold many copies and have them come in by the case. The binding is really poor and they simply fall apart after a little use. Too bad they spent time creating the book, only to downsize its value for a long keeping book."
5,hollywood Vs the mob documentary n highlights of classic movies,Its was a verey informative I loved it n found out a bunch of new stuff about my fav gangster movies I didn't know.
2,Hollywood Vs the Mob,"Ive only watched one, it was more about Edward R Robinson and some thirtys film. I just hope it gets better."
4,"Hard, but great fun","This is a great game for enthusiastic viewers of the show. People who have not watch many shows are somewhat lost, but still enjoy the conversations."
4,Scene It- Friends Version,"Our family love watching ""Friends"" so this game was perfect for our teenagers as a gift for Christmas!Amazon had the item, when most retailers were sold out close to the holidays.I would recommend it, along with the other versions of ""Scene It"", which are fun and entertaining trivia for the entire family of any age."
2,Not such a great text,"My teacher says this is the best book he's ever read about intercultural communication. I, however, can't appreciate this book as much as he has. I can't help but feel it was written by someone straight out of an English 102 class. Sometimes you'll get some interesting trivia thrown at you, but most of the time I can barely stand looking at this cheap, paperback, black and white excuse of a text-book. Probably the worse thing about it was that I had to pay over $60 for a brand new copy. After reading this book, however, I will admit that it's made me think about how I interact with those around me, so its accomplished its purpose. But be forewarned, it you have a hard time reading bland text-books, you'll probably only find yourself jotting down the definitions of the bold-text words so you'll pass the exams."
5,Love this phone!,"I really love this phone. I've had it for a few years and have never had any problems with it. No lost calls, no charging problems, nothing. This phone works great."
1,Don't buy this phone,I agree with the comment of hitting the on/off button when talking. This phone also does not hold a charge for very long. I could live with these faults but not the one I'm experiencing now. The phone will not charge at all. I'm about a month out of the warranty and this phone will not charge when put on the base. The battery is almost dead and I'm going to have to throw the phone away. Useless. I would not recommend this phone.
2,A great watch with an awful band.,"Just as the other reviewers said, the steel cross bar broke through the rubber band leaving me with a great pocketwatch but a poor wristwatch. The watch itself is great, and I've had other great Nike watches, but the band is awful."
3,Passenger Station without lights,"I purchase this item believing it was a ""lighted"" passenger station. When I received it, I noticed you had to have a certain king of train set to hook up to, in order to attach the station to light it up. It was not what I expected. I have to put in a lighted candle to make it light up."
1,Poor wiring,This product is not well made - daddy had to strip wires just for contact and the light is so dim it is not at all impressive. Would have returned it if it was not from Santa. Very cheap construction and disappointing.
3,"Good Album, But Not Great","This album is not on the level as Way Out West's self titled album, but it is well composed and overall a quality album (CD1). W.O.W. use a lot of female vocal work in the tracks on this album. A couple of the tracks are enhanced by the vocal work, but most are deflated by the plain, steryotypical, overdone, and superficial lyrics which is a shame becuase most of the musical composition is very well done. I think people that are into the club scene or have a significant other that is into more ""feminine"" electronica would really enjoy the album.The songs do tend to take on a ""sameness"" because of the heavy use of VAs, Romplers, and heavy filter use. Some analog synth work would have helped make the sound of the tracks more lively and diverse. The drum work is excellent as always.CD2 is a progressive mix. I'm not much into the style so my opinion will be biased. I'm sure there are many people that would think it is great, but I found it to be too soft."
2,Just So Disappointing,"I LOVED the first 2 WOW CDs and also all the maxi singles, but this CD JUST SUCKS. It is boring. It never does anything to move you. The first two CDs take you orbiting into dance hysteria -I mean, Dancehall Tornado -it's just that! I'm not fond of the new singer. The rhythm is weighed down, sluggish, and boring. There is absolutely nothing interesting on this CD -anywhere. I am just so disappointed. At least the rest of their collection is wonderful enough to keep my dancing. The second CD is just as boring."
2,just other compilation... / sólo una compilación más,"from cd1 i selected themes 3 & 6, the others.... nothing new / del disco 1 me quedo con los temas 3 y 6, del resto... nada nuevo.dont waste your $$$ / no gastes tus"
1,"Unoriginal, repetitive","I heard ""Rewind"" on the radio and liked it so much, I pre-ordered the disc. When it came i was seriously dissapointed, but that makes sense since i fell for the easily accessible hook of a radio hit. Every song is so repetitive and they're not even repeating anything particularly interesting or original. If you've heard a song once, it feels like you've actually heard it ten times. The lyrics also seemed quite lame as well. I love new music but this was just a bunch of sampled garbage."
1,price is PER PENCIL not per box!,I have ordered these for years from other sources and this is the price per box of one dozen. I missed under tech specs it is PER PENCIL not per box of one dozen. I have ordered these from a dental vendor and ordered the 4 boxes we need for almost the same cost of the 4 pencils. I am returning these. The final cost of the $19.04 for 4 pencils is insane!
3,more info would be nice,"How can anyone buy these without knowing the grit (150, 180, 220?) and the profiles (flat, 1/2 round, round, triangle?) Even better/useful pictures would help. Add them or some of this info and double or triple your sales."
1,expected much better,"This whistle is junk. It isn't loud at all and you have to work a little to even get noise. I would not recommend it for self-defense, that's certain."
2,Rescue??,"I received my whistle and ""Rescue"" is written in Red on one side. There was no information stating that there would be words on the whistle."
4,Fox 40 Classic Safety Whistle Yellow,"Bought this to use on my school bus if the kids get too loud. I am happy to say I HAVE NOT HAD TO USE IT YET. I like the color and the way it looks attached to my bus driver badge. I was a little disappointed in the sound, it is not as loud as I expected- probably a good thing."
4,Good Whistle,"I needed the whistle for a class I am taking and found it to be a great whistle. You need to blow quite hard to get a good sound out of it, but it is loud. I also like the idea of it being pea-less. There is no rattle when it moves around."
5,a great whistle,"I purchased this whistle for hiking since it is less prone to malfunction. The neon color is nice and bright which might make it easier to spot in some situations. The whistle is very loud with a great sound. I have read about some people complaining it requires that one blows very hard in order for it to whistle, but I have found that to be not true. I am not sure how coaches would use this type of whistle on an everyday basis without wearing ear plugs because it would cause permanent hearing loss.The whistle comes with a small and large ring. They seem to be made from brass. The plastic is of decent quality and it should not readily crack, chip, or break. In my opinion it is overpriced, but I know I am in paying partly for it's reputation."
4,Fast and Furious,"Take a spoiled little rich playgirl and pair her with a deeply-closeted cop and what do you get? A funny, light story about two women coming of age and changing each others' lives. Start with CJ Riley, the only daughter of a wealthy father and a girl who won't grow up. She won't take responsibility for herself and lives recklessly. She meets stern cop Lois Franklin one night while speeding down the highway and decides Lois is just the challenge she's seeking. Of course, Lois is less than impressed with CJ and that's when the fun begins.CJ has a wake-up call when her father has a heart attack and she's needed to take over the family business. The only question is, will taking on this responsibility make her more attractive to Lois or will it tear them apart?Like most books by Jones, this one is enjoyable. The book is fairly short, but the characters are broadly developed and likable."
4,Take it with you!,"This is a handy book to take with you when prowling the antique stores for old writing instruments. Recommended by collectors and collector clubs, it's the handiest guide available. If it had an index and covered more of the less well known brands, I would give it five stars."
4,A valuable guide to carry with you.,"This is a valuable and handy pocket (briefcase, etc.) guide to take on a pen expedition. It's a bit big for anything but a large overcoat pocket but is handy when carried in a case. It is mostly a guide to the identification of some of the pens to be found at pen shows and elsewhere. There are brief histories of 18 fountain pen manufacturers but they are short to rudimentary. There is a short but to the point and valuable guide to how to grade a pen.The rest of the book is devoted to colored photos of various fountain pens. The pictures are very good and the selection of pens shown is very good. The values shown are, like all prices shown in such books, progressively out of date. They are good though to give a relative value for pens.This is an excellent book for its purpose - to help identify, grade and price used fountain pens. It does its specified purpose well. It's not meant to be an encyclopedia. Such a book would have to be a many volumn set."
5,The single finest reference on the subject available today.,"Now in a completely revised, updated and expanded third edition, Stuart Schneider and George Fischler's The Illustrated Guide To Antique Writing Instruments continues to be the finest single volume identification and reference guide to pens and other writing instruments for collectors and dealers. Beautifully illustrated on every page with full color photographs of antique pens of all makes and categories, this uniquely beautiful and informative price guide is an indispensable reference that is an essential and enthusiastically recommended addition to any personal, professional, or community library antiques/collectibles reference book collection."
5,The best fountain pen book for the size,"This is by far the best book on the subject for the size. It has great pictures (all colored), concise information, and very informative price guides. It covers lots of different pens from major companies, such as Parker, Sheaffer, Waterman, Wahl-Eversharp, Conklin. It also has some useful information on some obscured old US pen companies (all gone now). I don't understand why people are so excited about the big book ""Fountain Pens of the World"" by Lambrou. It does have more company information and time-line of products and covers more international companies, but that big book has no price guide at all, and is about 8 times more expensive than this little book. In terms of the coverage of the types of pens in major US companies, the big Lambrou book is quite much inferior to this little book. I just love this little one. But admittedly, you need to have more than one books to do some cross-reference."
5,Very Detailed and Elaborated Dragon,"Actually, it's not a toy... It's more like a collection figure... It has amazing details, very well elaborated... Great design, a very cool Figure!!!"
3,Brazilian pop/new wave box set,"This 4-CD box set reissues four albums by this Brazilian ""new wave"" rock band-- ""Cidades Em Torrente,"" from 1986, ""A Era Da Incerteza"" (1987), ""Ze"" (1989) and ""Decivilizacao,"" from 1991. It's pretty dorky, but so was the music from the USA that it sought to replicate..."
1,The Story of the Kind Wolf,"As a grandparent of 3, I purchase all kinds of wonderful books for my grandchildren. This is not one of them. The story has page after page of animals killing and 'gobbling' each other up. Great illustration of a fox with a mouse in it's mouth. The wolf takes the advise of an owl and goes from the forest to find a new way of life. While he's away, the story tells of a bitterly cold winter and animals becoming desperate with the cold and hunger. The wolf turns into a vegetarian and turns all the little animals in the forest to fruit and vegetables instead of meat. Who do you think is behind this book? I gave it 1 star becaus -10 was not available. Thank goodness I read this book before reading it to my grandchildren, they would have had nightmares for weeks."
5,Best Book for Restoring Romanitc Love,"I have studied marriage and family therapy for three years in graduate school, yet this book has transformed my practice [...] to the point that you could easiy consider me nothing more than a marriage tutor because all I do now is teach this book to couples who want to revive the flame of romantic love in their marriages. Its full title is ""Five Steps to Romantic Love: A Workbook for Readers of Love Busters and His Needs, Her Needs and Love Busters"" and you don't even have to read Love Busters and His Needs, Her Needs to get the full effect. If you look at the author's site, [...], you will see what I mean."
1,Kindle Version,"Don't purchase the Kindle version. You cannot print the workbook any part of the workbook, nothing. Amazon said to purchase a text editor if I want to print any of the pages. What good is an electronic workbook if you can't print it to work with?"
5,This album is one of Caldwell's early masterpieces!,"When I heard ""Jamaica"", the first single off of this album, I immediately ran out and purchased a copy of ""Carry On"". Much to my surprise the whole album possessed the R&B-Jazz fusion sound I was listening to at the time. Caldwell's vocals also weave in and out of his stylish Latin and Reggae laiden tunes complimenting there perfection. The imagery of his lyricism is captivating on ""Jamaica"" and even more thought provoking on ""Catwalk"". I am glad to see that this release is now available on CD. It was slightly ahead of it's genre then and it is essential to the audiophile who collects recordings that mark a transition in R&b musics style and progression."
5,bobbys finest,"this selection is his most affecting compilation. great pics.My favorite Caldwell album. ""Carry On"" Plenty of slow jams and cool grooves."
2,Skip this rabbit,"Can't understand the rave reviews for this repetitive book, the dialogue of which makes kids tune out, and adults cringe. It's ok if you skip most of the text, esp the ""said Mr Rabbit"" and ""said the little girl"" and paraphrase so try it at the library before buying it."
5,Charming,"This was one of my favorite picture books as a child. Every child can relate to wanting to give a perfect gift to his or her mother for her birthday, and yet without having money. Sendak's illustrations are softer and dreamier here than they are in his more well-known books, which goes well with the dream-like quality of the story.I am giving this copy to my niece for a Christmas present. I hope she enjoys it as much as I did."
5,Enchanting Children's Book,I love this book! It is a sweet story with enchanting pictures. I have used it to review color words with my young students.
2,Predictable,This is a to predictable image of Africa. Why must Americans always treat AFrica like a giant zoo?
3,What foreign cars will take this steering fluid?,Not enough info on the label and the company does not know the answers.What foreign cars can use the steering fluid?
5,Shampoo leaves hair soft and shiney. No more flakes or itching. Stocked up. PH balances your head.,Shampoo leaves hair soft and shiney. No more flakes or itching. Stocked up. PH balances your head. What I loved is the ALL NATURAL ingredients and they are not kidding. Not one chemical. You can't find another shampoo without chemicals. Amazing. i was happy to finally find this after researching 100s of so-called natural and organic shampoos.
2,Bamboo window film not so good,This product did not meet our expectations. It was much darker that what was on the website and was more difficult to put up. However we found a video on how to put up the product that was very helful.
1,Color not as pictured,The background is blue and there are other colors in the bamboo than what is pictured. Don't get it. Inaccurate picture. I'm returning mine.
3,Missing headband,"The costume was shipped promptly and received. Big problem: Inside the FedEx box was the costume in a plastic the bag (which came already opened and the contents sloppily stuffed back in) and one of the three key parts of the costume was missing. Basically there should be the robe, the head scarf, and the head band. There was no head band included. We contacted the seller who, after a couple more calls, finally sent a headband (which they said they took from another costume -- feel bad for the child who got THAT costume ALSO with no headband). Guess what -- it didn't match. Close, but no cigar. Unfortunately, it'll have to do since our son's nativity play is in a couple of days. Overall, the version of product we got just wasn't up to snuff."
1,Stay away from this one,"Corel offers essentially no support for the Mac. According to their website, there is no support after 30 days, except for customer discussions which are inaccessible to OS X (because OS X will not accept websites beginning with ""news""). The program in version 7 is incompatible with Wacom drivers, according to the Corel website. Our copy will not open at all in Panther. Furthermore, the supposed upgrade for version 7 will not download from the Corel website. Clearly, Corel is in trouble -- and why should you get involved and founder with a sinking ship?"
5,Classic R&B@its finest!!!!,I LOVE THIS WHOLE CD. THIS IS A GREAT CD DONE BY SOME GREAT SINGERS. I LOVE THESE SONGS. THIS WAS A REALLY GREAT GROUP; MANY PEOPLE DID REMAKES OF THEIR MUSIC. I LIKE ALL OF THE SONGS ON THIS CD. THIS CD MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN R&B WAS GOOD MUSIC. I LIKE THIS GROUP THEY SING WELL AND THE LYRICS ARE VERY NICE AS WELL. I ENJOY THIS WHOLE CD AND I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO LIKES TAVARES OR CLASSIC R&B TO BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL DEFINITELY ENJOY IT.
2,I DONT KNOW WHATS WORSE..HOBBS OR ZANE!!,"Okay so if u work at a gas station on the grave yard shift, u would probably write this book in ur free time, but other than that..nope. This is the book written by a fat woman, with a skinny sister she precariously lives her life through.. and chips on her breath!!"
1,very bad!!!,"This book is terrible every time I was reading it I feel asleep, it has no suspense, it just doesnt keeps you interested, you just finish it because you began reading it but thats all."
4,Good Debut Novel,Allison Hobbs tells a good story about Victoria who was burnt and robbed of her inheritance forcing her to call Pandora's box which is a brothel. She gets addicted to the fast money and material things until major things start happening at Pandora's box that makes her have to rethink her job. Very explicit well told story that puts you right in the brothel not as a prostitute but as a spectator.Very good debut novel.
3,Okay,"This book was okay. If you do not have patience fo slow books, i strongy do not recommend this. Victoria is a single mother who spends all of her inheritence on a music career that does not happen. As a result, she turns to a brothel as a source of income. But, Pandora's isn't r average whore house, these women have serious issues.Reds and Dominique are old, and are barely making moneyBethany and Sheena are strung out on drugs. Bethany ends up leting her infant die, the question is did she kill him.Miquon is a chubby, theiving, ignorant single mother.Victoria is trying to be a mother to her son, but having to have sex for money is pitty. One day a customer comes in and it soon changes her life.This book shows how women are forced to make ends meet, and how some choose jobs that are degrading but pays at the same time."
2,i don't know why but ..............,"i actually could not get into this book.it didn't draw me look so many other good books:chyna black,true to the game,flyy gurl,coldestest winter ever,etc. i just couldn't get into it."
4,my first,"This is the first Allison Hobbs novel and the first urban book I ever read about 2 years ago. It really turned me on to these kinds of books and I've been an Allison Hobbs fan ever since. It's a great read, highly recommended."
3,Ok,I havr read other books by Hobbs and this is my least favorite. The main character did not keep my attention and the ending was dissapointing. Love the others I have read.
2,uhhhhh,this book was not what i expected. it was ok but it seemed so far from the title and i felt like it had no real story line.
1,luv_books,"The book is soo boring. I had previously rwad put a ring on it by hobbs. That was a slow book, but I wanted to give hobbs a chance. I read the book on my way to kansas, from where I live, ita 8hrs away. So I had time to waste. The whole time am thinking who is who. With it being a whore house, theses ladies are pretty boring and seemingly unattractive. I couldn't keeep up with the personalities or the main character victoria.. I havrny fifnished the book yet, because in my mnd am guessing the end. However I will finish it... EVENTUALLy. If you want the book, which in my opinion you not messing anything, borrow it, I said borrow not buy or purchase.."
1,Horrible,This book was a waste of my time and money. This is the first book that I have read by this author and I am sure it will be the last. It took all of my energy and power to make it to the last page.I was very disappointed
1,What's the point,Just finished reading the book after 3 days. Normally it takes me 4 hours to read a book. This book was so boring it didn't hold my attention but I didn't want to waste the $15 I paid for it so I finished it. Nothing interesting happened. It leaves you feeling like ...okay and...
3,I GUESS IT WAS A GOOD BOOK............,THE BOOK WAS OKAY MY FRIEND WAS READING THIS BOOK AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT TRY IT OUT. IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE AUTHOR TO GET TOO THE POINT OF THE BOOK.LOL. UM........I WISH THAT IT WOULDVE HAD A LITTLE MORE DRAMA AND SCANDLE.<3STACEY
3,HARD TIMES ...WHEW!,"Pandora's Box aka A HEl* Hole! This story reminds me of that song by City High:""what would you do if your son was at home crying all alone on the bedroom floor cause he's hungry?-and the only way to feed is to sleep with a man for a little bit a money and his Daddys gone..etc"" Anyway, it was a decent read it would of been better if it weren't so dam* drawn out! Hoe'n is not the way to go and these ladies found out the hard way. I say give it a shot if you can borrow or rent from the library. This probally is the weakest book from this author."
4,Good Book,"I read this book about 2 years ago, and from rereading the excerpt right now, the book came back to me with a snap... I remember this book being good and I would probably re-read it again in a couple of years. Good book for curious minds of the massage business."
1,Don't waste your time,"Finally read the book after having it far so long and now I know why. It was boring. The book has 39 chapter and it doesn't get interesting until the 30th chapter when Victoria falls for a man that came to Pandora's, Victoria quits her job, you know the ending. I could never get in to it."
2,OK,"This book was okay, but i guess compared to other books that i've read, this book was a little slow."
2,This book was just average.,"I must start by stating that my standards are pretty high. After reading books like the coldest winter ever, B-more careful, and Black; I simply could not enjoy or appreciate this book. There was no suspense, no desire to stay up late at night to read this book, and not even any real desire to find out how the book ended. I finished it because i felt obligated to. The book was not terrible, it just was not anywhere among the best. If you're interested in the day to day lives of a prostitute you may find this book interesting but she could have just added more twists to the story."
5,Great DVD,"These DVDs are great - the printer label on them makes it easy to mark what the disc is, even without the printer (like me) you can use markers on them without needing to buy labels or get a sticker. They burn well, have not had issues with a bad burn because of the disc. I would buy these again and recommend them to anyone who is looking for DVDs."
2,Classic Guitar Gig Bag,The case was not as padded nor as sturdy as I needed. I have seen other gig bagsequally as light but with styrofoam padding which is stronger and more protective.The manufacturer needs to be more detailed in his description of the padding. I had to return it but I am sure it might the needs of others.
5,Reliable Fancypants Power Supply,"I have owned two of these in the last 5 years. That's impressive reliability considering the heavy use I subject my computers to. This power supply has more cables than most computers could possibly use, you will need a place to cram the unused cables into to keep the computer's hardware easy to access.Only bad thing I can think of is that there is no way to turn the LEDs off without either turning the computer off or placing into stand-by. They give off a lot of blue light!If I had to buy another power supply, I would buy from the same brand, but bump up the wattage. 500 watts is now on the lower side of computer power."
1,Worked For about 2 months,"This power supply came with the Aspire alien case I bought. This box had everything and was fairly easy to hookup... After about 2 months of using this for maybe 20 hours a week My PC would not power up anymore. Upon pressing the power button, all the fans would turn for a split second and then lose all power. The LED on the motherboard showed that there was power coming to it so I figured maybe it just had too much hooked up to it. I removed all power to all devices except the motherboard and it still did the same thing. Then I threw in a 300Watt power supply and it powered right up. For the amount of money I paid for this case and the so called 500 watt power supply I expected it to last longer than 200 hours. Now I gotta find a replacement. Thanks for a P.O.S. and many hours wasted diagnosing the problem Aspire. Never again!"
5,The Best Kids Show Out There,"This is a fantastic show for toddlers. Mine is 2 years old, and LOVES this show. It's her favorite, even more than Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. In the regular episodes she loves the singing and dancing and likes to copy their moves. I like the wholesome and pretend nature of each show. I love that it's all about imagination.I highly recommend this for toddler aged children. Especially if they like to dance and sing. It's one of the only kid's shows that I can watch along with her, and now be completely bored or annoyed."
5,Couldn't be better!,"My grandson ""worships"" this and other Bubble Guppies presentation. I regret that I cannot get all of season 2 or purchase these on DVD, since it is difficult to download this on media other than the computer...at least for me."
5,Bubble Guppies Rock!!!,Bubble Guppies are the perfect show for the toddler or preschooler in your life. The songs are adorable as are the characters. Molly and Bubble Puppy are my daughters favorite. The stories and songs all teach something every episode is adorable and we have yet to dislike anything about them.
5,YAY! 45 minutes of Bubble Guppies!,My daughter LOVES this show! She has watched this REPEATEDLY! So cute. 45 minutes versus the regular approximately 24 minutes videos is nice when I need her occupied if I need to do something that takes a bit of time. She is GLUED to the screen. This show is so sweet and they always say please and thank you. Usually educational this one is a bit more fun and fantasy including a lot of our classic fairy tales is a unique one in itself.
5,Highly recommended,My 3yr old son loves Bubble Guppies. I think the show is so adorable and very educational. I just wish they would put more episodes on DVD.
4,amazing HD quality to view on my kindle fire HD,"the quality of the video is simply amazing. my 4 year old absolutely love this video. with the adobe digital stereo audio, watching it on kindle fire HD7 is an absolutely amazing experience.."
5,my son loves bubble guppies,my son loves the bubble guppies and trucks/cars when he saw this show he went crazy..thank you bubble guppies for teaching and entertaining my two year old son a lot of things. this is the only show he will sit and watch..
5,Awesome show!,"My son is 2.5 years old and loves this episode of Bubble Guppies! Unfortunately it hasn't come out on dvd yet,so i had to buy it this way, but at least that is an option! It's a great episode for any kid (boy or girl) that loves cars and trucks!"
5,Love them!!,"Bubble guppies is a life saver. We never leave home without them. I have it downloaded on my kindle and I've played them in my car for my son since he was 6 mos old. They keep him totally entertained. The only sucky part is that they are only 22 minutes long (not usually long enough to get where I'm going) so I have to pull over and hit another episode every 20 minutes. You would think that kindle or iPad would have been smart enough to invent an auto repeat or loop button for kids videos. If anyone knows if any apps that do this for either device, holla!!!"
1,Does not start the job well,"This book does not do a good job of getting the small experiments running. And w/o that, it is difficult to get any handle over the big picture. If you haven't done XML and Oracle integration before, this book definitely is not what you are looking for."
2,Sloppy editing,"Got the book a few days ago. I've been going through the examples. You can download all the source code from the Oracle Press web site, which is nice. But the examples in the book aren't given names or numbers, and the web site (although it does at least separate them by chapter) uses a cryptic and unexplained naming convention, so finding the code you want is confusing.And it gets worse. The very first example in the book (and the downloaded code) won't compile; it calls a method that doesn't exist. I was able to work-around it. The second example wouldn't compile either; it has a typo. The fixes are easy enough so far, but it's frustrating. I guess they didn't have enough time to actually edit the book. Hopefully the online code will eventually be fixed. Disappointing so far. :("
2,Typos,"I guess I am rushing to judgement - but in the first 10 pages I read, there were about 8 typos - so I am giving this a 2 stars for now. Will update my review/rating as I go along."
3,chewy,"chewie is my favorite character,non-human, of course. Kids can use a lot of imagination with this guy. you have to love this ""fuzz-ball"". Enjoy!"
1,Cheap Toys,"For almost 28 years now I have loved Star Wars, and I could not wait for the third and final movie because my oldest son would be the same age I was when I first saw Star Wars. Well... lets just say that Lucas is off to another bad start with this final movie. My son has most of the new figures, and all of them are falling apart after less then two weeks. C-3PO broke the first day out off the box, along with Yoda. My son and I are very disappointed by these toys, and are planning on saving our money and not giving any more to a greedy old man that is steeling from his fans by making half baked toys and movies (the last two). DO NOT BY THESE TOYS!!!!"
2,"First Quality Personal Cloths, 42-Count Cloths (Pack of 16)","This product is ok, but I don't care for ordering so many plastic boxes that are not recyclable... I wrote the company about producing refills, but got no answer. Because of this, I am going to discontinue my automatic re-order."
5,"A wonderful, wondering book","I use this book as a daily practice of self reflection. It is a book of thought provoking questions about how we live life. Today I flipped to this one, ""Have you begun today what you wish to be tomorrrow?"". It is such a great book that my husband and I each have our own copy."
3,"Decent reference, but not really How To Draw","If the title was ""Reference for Mecha Drawings"" I'd give it one more star. It doesn't show you How to Draw, it zooms in on different parts of a Mech, where to get inspiration, what works and what to avoid.Nowhere in the book do they show you how to sketch a drawing of a Mech. If you know how to draw well already and want a reference book for using your talents to draw Mecha, this is a good book. If you are just starting out learning how to draw, this book is not it."
2,"The good, the bad, and the ugly..","First of all this book has some decent examples of individual component parts of robots/mecha that will help you to realize decisions that must be made for your own designs, and while the intentions of the author is to give inspiring examples of fully finished robots and mecha also, the designs are not that great or dynamic. In fact, many of the robots are just flat out hideous looking. In other words, there's nothing here on the level of Gundam or Transformer type designs, but on the other hand it does give insight into components parts like hands, joints, weapons, etc."
5,Great for any project,"While it is designed for the three-hole horn lenses in a 3 5/16"" bolt pattern, you can, with some know-how and a little drilling, be able to attach this adapter to any bolt on horn lens or to any other horn-related project, so you can use any of the 1 3/8"" spin on horn drivers with a 18 threads per inch thread out there. They're made of a durable plastic which makes it even better. I'm using the pair I bought on the baskets of 6X9"" speakers and forming my own lenses in the baskets to make a pair of 6X9"" horns. I'll just need to spin on my choice of horn driver and I'm good to go."
3,a bit disapointing,"some of the songs are great! However, most of them were not what I expected. Stick with the originals!"
1,Bad Latin-Flavored Follow-up to a Good First Disc,"I bought the first Motown Remixed a year or two ago and really enjoyed many of the tracks. There are MANY gems on the first disc. But this disc should be subtitled ""The Latin Remixes"". Latin rhythms are great-- but EVERY mix here is latin-flavored, and it gets boring fast. I made the mistake of not reviewing the album first online. I was eager to purchase because I really liked the first album, and i figured, 'how bad can it be.' So, listen to a few tracks first before you buy."
2,"If a 3rd remix CD is released, I WILL preview it before purchasing","Even though I just got the CD and only listen to it once, I think I'll burn my two favorites and shelf it. I liked CD 1, and just picked up 2 assuming it would be better but didn't. The only cut that I really liked and ended up cleaning to was the Marvin Gaye remix. It's housey enough to build up a sweat and get a few chores done. I would love if they did another CD making it a truly club/house with no breaks. Can you image 80+ minutes mixed together with echoes, bass and beats? Man.... Oh yeah, if anyone from Motown is reading this, please don't repeat songs on the next CD that were featured on the two previous. Choose another song by the group/artist or release a EP with 5+ versions if you really feel the need. I'm hopeful, and may even grow to like # 2 more -but still won't buy the next remix on impulse."
5,Delightful entertainment,"My 6 months old son listened intently to the rymes of the text. His eyes became big when I pointed out individual characters or objects of the colourful illustrations in this book. I was amazed how this book kept my son's undivided attention from front to back cover. As an adult however, I have to admit the story-line suffers in an attempt to make the words rhyme."
3,Competent but lacks spark,"Fun and quirky stories loosely connected to a neighborhood bar. Interesting for awhile, but, about halfway through, the lack of real spark began to take it's toll, and I elected not to finish the book. Worth a read - some might find more in the storries, and they are fun stories."
4,Some Food is Best Served Cold,"For Christmas, I received this book autographed by three of the authors and by the editor. As a gift, the personalized autographs were great. I tend to prefer the novel to this format, which is a compilation of short stories with common elements (Private Investigators and food). Some stories were funnier, while others could be described as gritty. A couple of the stories were so good that I wish that they were novels so I could sink into them for the day. Overall, it was a great gift and good reading, but not something that I will read on a regular basis."
5,Great White Twice Shy,This is an excellent CD it really sounds great all the songs sound cool.This is a cool CD to have in your collection if your a fan of the bands music.
5,80S HARD ROCK AT IT'S BEST!,"GREAT WHITE WAS ONE OF THOSE BANDS THAT BLEW ME AWAY. THIS RECORD IS BY FAR THERE BEST TO DATE AND THE MOST SUCESSFUL TOO. GREAT SONGS LIKE ""HOUSE OF BROKEN LOVE"" AND THE TOP 10 HIT ""ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY"" MAKE THIS RECORD STAND OUT. BUT THE BEAUTIFUL BALLAD ""THE ANGEL SONG"" IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO ANY ROCK FAN!CHECK IT OUT.YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED."
2,over-priced,"Since the suggested retail for this Rapala fillet knife was about $30 I thought the knife would be exceptional -- longer than their usual fillet knife, more comfortable to work with, better quality or unusual appearance; but that doesn't seem to be the case other than a blade that is a bit more flexible. It is a fine fillet knife, but not much better than their standard knife at about half the cost."
5,Toy Box,"This is a toy box not a toy. It is nice to have in the room and safe for little fingers and hands. Holds a lot of ""stuff"" in the box with 2 shelves for books and special stuffed animals."
5,Good,"I needed to cut off two tabs to install the lights in my 89 Toyota pickup, But all in all they look really good and fit good"
4,"Excellent Start, But Fades Into A Semi-SoapOpera........","Yes, the wild life and rough weather of the Olympus peninsula, are described terrifically here, along with the shady manipulations of some ""herbal"" drug specialists. What a fwwl for the flora and fauna this author has! A nice mystery too, even if a little obvious by the author's clear sympathies. Some nice characterizations, too..But the story did drag a bit, and the soap opera was thankfully kept under wraps. All in all, a nice effort, particularly for an Easterner not familiar with this Washington State locale."
2,seen better from Latin America,"When you see review blurbs on the case like ""GRIPPING!"" or ""EXHILIRATING..."" I was expecting more but this movie is just another art ""fillum."" First of all, you know it's an art film because it's in black and white. Add in the plodding pace, the tired and worn cliches (working class people hate foreigners who come to their country and ""take their jobs"").This has all been done before and far better. I was hoping for more depth and breadth of character from a nation I am fascinated but this sadly fails to meet my expectations.The extras are just the trailer and deleted scenes, just in case you're actually thinking of forking over any pesos for this piece of ""cinema."""
1,don't bother..the movie is not gripping ni important,I bought this film and was very disappointed don't make the same mistake I did. do not buy it a tremendous wasted of moneythe theme is important but this ia a treatment demasiado corritente nada especially
5,Wonderful book for our speech delayed daughter,"My almost three year old daughter loves this book and requests it every night before bed. The reason I think it is special is that the illustrations encourage the reader's verbal participation. For example, at the end of the book when Clara still isn't tired and might get out of bed again with another imaginary friend, my daughter Jane says ""No Tata"" and tries to put her back under the covers so she will go to sleep. Or, in the middle of the book when Clara is blows a bubble to be carried into the sky, Jane will pretend to blow the bubble. Or, when the bubble pops, my daughter will holler ""POP!"". I have to say that I enjoy the book just as much as my daughter does and can say that this is a book I do not mind reading again and again."
1,I made that same mistake!,"I wish I would have seen your review before purchasing this cd. I also assumed this was the same band that was featured in Kill Bill 2, but to my utter dissapointment, it's not. This is a rap/hip hop style album. Don't make this mistake!"
1,NOT the Chingon from Kill Bill 2,"Don't make my mistake and assume that this is a collection of music from the band that Rodriguez pulled together for Kill Bill 2 (including the incredible live performance on the DVD). Check out Mexican Spaghetti Western (also listed under ""Chingon,"" but this one is the group gathered by Rodriguez) - and if you are really serious, listen to the 3 most recent Del Castillo albums."
1,NOTHING TO DO WITH ROBERT RODRIGUEZ!!,"I was hoping to hear the rockin' spanish flavor of the Robert Rodriguez band Chingon, but what the hell is this?!!!The Amazon recomendations lead me to this album, and hinde sightI should have read a little more before buying, but I was too excited to hear more of the Rodriguez Chingon.I hope this helps you."
1,chingon?????????,"This is not Chingon Group of Robert Rodriguez, this is another rap group of ""pochos"". Well if you like rap music buy it."
5,My 2nd fav pita chip,"only after Stacy's Parmesan flavor. Usually when you buy some mass market foods, the product is hot flavored, not really hot and spicy. Not so with these chips. You eat a serving or two, you'll remember it 20 minutes later. There is some real kick on these chips and with the way they are labeled and presented on the bag, that's what I expect.If you want a flavorful, spicy snack, try these."
5,Hot and Tasty,"Best ever. My friends thought it was a gag snack at first, but kept coming back for more. Real winner. Should have a Caution ""HOT"" on it."
3,"BOUGHT 2 weeks ago, NOT AT THIS PRICE","I feel AMAZON & the company who is offering the sale should honor prices back to 30-45 days ago, they should be held accountable, just like any retail store, I took delivery about to weeks ago, and I should get a retro check for the difference in what I paid, which would be $20.00 per chair I bought 2, also I never received the FREE Umbrella, just the side bag.. BUYERS BEWARE"
4,good book on the centurion,"The Centurion is one of the most important and successful tanks ever, and this is a good book on it. It covers the development of this tank well. It makes a good companion to the author's earlier ""The Centurion Tank in Battle"", which covers better the combat career of the ""Cent"". The Osprey books pack a lot in a thin volume, and this one is no exception, though sometimes one wishes for a bit more. Another book on the Centurion which is probably worth checking out is ""The Centurion Tank"" by Bill Munro."
5,Every Writer Should Read This,"This book has relevant and up to date information for anyone who is trying to break into print. It is a must for beginning authors, and a good reference for those who are published. Since getting this book I have published several articles, and I know a lot more about the industry as a whole."
5,A superior how-to book,"This is the best book I've ever read on getting published. It's instructive, no-nonsense, and remarkably wide-ranging. Plus it doesn't waste time making digressions and idiotic ""jokes."" It sticks to the point, is witty and straight-talking. Ms. Appelbaum is knowledgeable and sympathetic to the business of writing. This is a book worth studying, not merely reading once. Thank you."
2,Great book--if you want to self-publish...,"Otherwise, not so helpful. Big chunks of the book are devoted to self-publishing, and often her ""solution"" to the challenges of being published is self-publishing. (Don't want to pay an agent a commission? Don't want to get stuck in a slush pile? Self-publish!) This book came highly recommended, but I was disappointed in it."
