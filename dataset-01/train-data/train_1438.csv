4,Strange Tale!,"This book was so wierd I had to review it. Not because it's a ""keeper"" per se, but because it was just so... wierd.It's about a town that has a big manor/mansion house that everyone's afraid of. A wild teen party gets out of hand one night, and the kids there find a little boy hanging in the cemetary, his insides, well, they're no longer inside. That kid's death unleashes the house to all the evil it's been caging. The evil rampages through the town killing people in the most gruesome ways. This was true horror. I found myself rereading parts to make certain I hadn't imagined what Clegg imagined. Turns out I hadn't. They were just as gory the second and third time I read them."
3,Not For the Faint of Heart--or Stomach,"Mr. Clegg warns that this addition to his series of Harrow House stories is not for everyone. BELIEVE HIM.THE ABANDONED is a modern literary version of a Hieronymos Bosch painting, a surreal plunge into a dark world where the deepest impulses of our lizard-brain come to vivid life. It is a seemingly endless journey into the dark, dank corners of the human soul that should not be undertaken if the goal is entertainment.Is it written well? Of course--Mr. Clegg is a superb writer even when he's wallowing in the id. I felt, though, that the wallowing went on a bit too long without any sign of relief, and that made it too hard to truly appreciate the superb surreality of the events and characters portrayed. The tale goes on too long without a spark of hope, the one thing most likely to keep us fighting to survive...and the reader willing to keep turning pages."
2,Not my kind of horror,"While I didn't find this book unreadable, I read it very quickly so I could move on to something good. Too many points of view, too much gore and foul language and worst of all, no explanations. It never says why almost the entire town goes crazy. It it because they simply stepped foot in Harrow house? Really? The entire town trespassed in an abandoned house?? I will not be keeping this one on my shelves."
2,Umm..,"It started out good, went to being okay, and then i was getting bored for about 150 pages or so. Finally i stopped reading it within the last 100 pages because of boredom and i didn't care about any of the characters. Clegg's other works are much better then this"
1,$28 for four liners,1.Identify Trends 2.Cut Losses 3.Maximize Profits 4.Manage Risk. Now send me $28 and forget about the book!
1,"Read the dust jacket, pass on the book","Read the dust jacket and learn the four key principles: trade with the trend, cut losses short, let profits run, and manage risk. You don't need to spend the $28 to buy the book."
2,Better Look Elsewhere...,"In a nutshell - the four rules - trade with the trend, cut losers, let winners run, and money management. Now you won't need the book. He interviews ""top"" traders and asks them the same questions. Example ""Do agree trading with the trend is important?"" Ans ""Of course"". These things I knew before I wasted money on this book. As another reviewer said ""If you want this book, you can have mine"" I'd love to stop myself out of it!"
3,A revisionist view and not very interesting.,"Fuller's account of the Career of Julius Caesar can also be found in Caesar's own commentaries. Some of his insights into Caesar's personality are interesting, but most can be found in classical works by Appian and Dio. His thesis that Caesar was not the great general and statesman that history dipicts him can be disputed. Caesar was the first ancient general to incorporate siegeworks as a tactical tool. Fuller's claim that the roman army was ""lucky"" that it did not encounter stronger cavalry arms is unfounded. Cavalry in anceint times was not much more than a skirmishing force, not in the same league as the legionares.I was displeased with the dry, accounts of caesar's campaigns, surprising for a military man like Fuller. Also, he does not go into great detail about Caesar's personality, other than to quote the classical historians.Overall, a very average work."
2,Good idea...maybe mine was defective...,"I bought this about a month or so ago. The instant read works great. I've used it many times and I'm pleased with it.However, this evening I put it in the oven to gauge the oven temp...and the glass covering the dial cracked. I think it is still usable, but that seems wrong. It isn't like I was transferring it from some really cold place...I put it in the oven as I preheated it, and bang...cracked somewhere between room temperature and 400. EDIT: I should add that in addition to being cracked, the oven thermometer also stopped working soon after that. Still use and like the instant read though."
1,Hasn't worked yet,"What were the engineers thinking who designed this thermometer? It's a great idea, but the design is ridiculous. It's so big and heavy, it simply doesn't work. I don't do a lot of roasting, but I've had it for months and I have yet to be able to use it, because it just sags under its own weight. I imagine it would support itself fine in a large roast, but It sure doesn't work in a chicken, or in a turkey, or in a pork tenderloin. So I can't even say whether it actually tells the temperature accurately or not, because it's never yet been in the oven. What's the point of having a meat thermometer if you have to have ANOTHER meat thermometer to use for all the times this one doesn't work? It was a waste of money, and it's been taking up a big chunk of space in my kitchen drawer for much too long. Into the trash with it."
1,Glass cracked on first use,"This seemed like a good idea, and I bought it without doing any research. After I brought it home, I read the reviews here and saw that some folks had experienced the glass breaking immediately. I used it just once -- for an oven-roasted leg of lamb for Christmas dinner, and after the estimated time took it out to read it. The meat reading seemed right, but the glass was cracked. Luckily no pieces seemed missing, so I could still serve my guests. Also luckily, I had bought it locally and could return it. I hope Polder takes note of these several comments and does something about this somewhat risky defect. I can't recommend this at all, because of this problem."
2,"Great concept, but....","I bought this last year to replace the standard $5 dial thermometers that always die after washing them. The concept is great, but the glass is not designed for thermal shock, and promptly shattered when I placed it in a roast on my barbecue rotisserie."
1,Garbage,This item does not work at all tried it out on Christmas Ham after being in the oven for 2 hours dial never got passed zero
1,Temperature is actually higher than shown...,"I was given one of these as a Christmas gift. We tried using it while cooking our Christmas roast dinner, and almost ruined dinner. Since it was new, we wanted to checked the meat temperature frequently, but the thermometer wasn't registering anything. Granted, the lowest temp is 120 degrees, so we kept checking. After a while, we decided to use a second probe (one that cannot stay in the oven) to compare. Luckily we did, because the second probe registered close to 130 degrees. We left the Polder probe in and continued cooking a little longer. All in all, the Polder probe was about 20 degrees lower than our second probe. Dinner was saved by relying on our second probe. The Polder thermometer proved that it can't be trusted.I agree with the first reviewer. Had we relied on this probe, the roast would have been over cooked. I don't recommend this product, and plan to return it for a refund, if possible."
1,"It's a nice thermometer, however after several uses, the glass cracked.","After using the this thermometer and enjoying it's accuracy, on about the 5th use the front glass cracked while it was in use in a 375 degee oven. It was at room temperature prior to being placed into a cold chicken and then placed into the oven. My guess is that the glass cracks from temerature change. That's the reason for a 1 star rating, otherwise I would give it a 5."
1,"Bad thermometer, bad company service from Polder","I received this for Christmas, 2012. On January 12, 2013, I used it for the first time in a standing rib roast. I noticed that after two hours the needle wasn't moving and when I took out the roast to check it with an instant read thermometer, I noticed the glass on the thermometer was cracked.I contacted the company (Polder) on their website. They sent me an e-mail giving me a case number stating someone from the company would be contacting me soon. My response days later asking about someone contacting me was also ignored. Polder will not stand behind their defective products. Do not buy. I got my money back from a store here and purchased the much better ""Taylor"" brand."
4,Does what it says on the tin,The addition of the oven temp is a nice touch works well and good value for money
1,Buyer beware,"Worked once and then no more ... another item to add to the overcrowding landfill. Save the earth, your money, and your time."
1,Polder glass cracked w/first use,This thermometer's glass cracked with my first use. I am not happy with this product.
1,Not a good product,"This product came highly recommended to me so I purchased two; one for grilling and one for inside use. Anyway, one did not work at all and the other only worked once. Also, the recommended internal temps are too high so one would overcook everything if you followed the product!"
3,It has potential,"Pros: Good for slow-roasting meat in the oven or on the grill. Good for keeping tabs on grill temp. It seems accurate when temping meat.Cons: Unless cooking a roast, you can't use both thermometers at the same time. The oven temp section doesn't work if you want to stick the thermometer in the grill vent. You can't temp meat if you've been using it to keep track of grill/oven temp. Doesn't work well as a general purpose thermometer e.g. when warming egg whites to pasteurize them, I couldn't get an accurate reading from it.While it had good potential for use in my kitchen and works for the most part, I wouldn't get it again and would instead go with a dedicated food thermometer and a dedicated grill thermometer"
1,Not Good,This thermometer takes so long to read the temperature of my oven. It's also too bulky to use while checking on the temperature of meat.
3,Eh,"Works just fine but the face of the thermometer broke very quickly. It didn't take a lot of abuse, the face cracked while jammed in the drawer. Good price, would consider reordering."
1,Funciono una sola Vez,Este articulo dejo de funcionar despues de usarlo una vez.No me habia fijado en la opinion de los usuarios.No lo recomiendo y no lo puedo cambiar porque me lo traje a Venezuela
5,WORKS GREAT!!! I LOVE IT!!!,"I REALLY WANTED A TRADITIONAL MOP AND WRINGER ON WHEELS,UNTIL I SAW HOW EXPENSIVE THEY ARE. I'D NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE AND IT WAS MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE,SO I THOUGHT I'D TRY IT. I'M SO HAPPY I DID. IT CUT MY MOPING TIME FOR TWO TILED ROOMS FROM OVER ONE HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES. NO NEED FOR RUBBER GLOVES, NO PAIN IN MY ARTHRITIC HANDS FROM MOP WRINGING AND NO FLOOR DRYING TOWELS TO WASH, AFTERWARDS. THE BUCKET HOLDS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WATER AND THE MOP WRINGER-COLANDER LOOKING GIZMO WORKS GREAT! I JUST WISH I'D BOUGHT IT BEFORE NOW. LOVE IT! NOTE TO RUBBERMAID- IF THIS BUCKET HAD WHEELS ON THE BOTTOM, THEN IT WOULD BE PERFECT!!!"
5,mop bucket with wringer,This mop bucket with wringer is very sturdy and keeps me from getting my hands wet and dirty. I would recommend this mop bucket because I did research and found this to be the best one.
3,Rubbermaid G034-06 mop bucket with ringer,Not what I expected--was not impressed with lift off wringer. Was surprised it worked as well as it did but it is small. Good for light mopping.
1,Too small for a regular mop,"Candidly, I was excited(if one can be excited about a mop bucket!) about finally finding a solution for a functional inexpensive mop bucket. The design and functionality are great.......if...............you're using a child's play mop. The seller also took almost 3 weeks to get it to me. Completely unacceptable. I'm returning it and hopeful to find another that is more practical for a regular sized mop"
3,Mop bucket,"Quick delivery and sooner than expected. Product was gray. Mop bucket was quite smaller than I expected. Much too small for my needs. Seller should add dimensions to this product. Approx. dimensions are: 9"" wide, 12"" long, 9"" deep. Wringer is 5"" dia. and 4"" deep, narrows to 3.5 inches at bottom.. Otherwise seems sturdy for small projects."
3,"Good, but check the dimensions!","This bucket and the wringer is on the small side, and would not work for my mop with a large T stem. I had to buy a new but relatively cheap mop that has a straight stem to make this work. Otherwise, this bucket is well made, and wringer works like a charm."
4,Feel very safe,"My 5 y/o son has been using this for the past 3 summers,in the pool and at the beach. He loves it, and is not afraid to swim with it on. It's comfortable, secure, and is teaching my son to swim. Like all other floatation vests, when in the water it will tend to go up around the chin, when my son is just floating and not swimming, he will just put his chin inside the vest. I'm in the process of buyning another one for my younger son!!"
5,the best way for kids to swim safely,"]I bought this for my 3 year old and later bought one for my neighbors kid to so she could also be able to swim with the other older kids and my son and have fun while learning to swim at the same time.I trust this product because I have used it everyday since we purchased it the only way your kid could drown is if someone or something was holding them underneith the water and common sense is to be supervising your child of course but believe a mother of three I wish I would of own this for my first son I don't know why more parents do not have these for their children because I would not allow my son to swim without it I feel it is that safe..buy the product you won't regret it and I have use all lifejackets, swimsuits you name it and this is the best that i have found also because it has a zipper that secures it in the back so kids can't take it off them selves which makes it the only one I have found made like that also."
2,dissapointed,well the watch looks amazing but i really tought its 42 mm the case well its less then 30 mm wich is kinda small for me...but the watch its super so u should put the real dimension~!!
1,Dissapointed,"I got this watch for my birthday and I got dissapointed because It's NOT easy to read, it confuses you because the lenght of the two hands almost look the same and you dont know which is which. So, I'm just going to get another swatch watch, there are plenty of other better ones out there ... so dont buy this one because it just look cool."
2,Looks Are Deceiving,"I received my earrings in a timely manner, however, the packaging was not secure enough to prevent the earrings from arriving with scratches. Not only that, but the image is deceiving. I didn't anticipate these earrings being so large! I felt like I was transported back to the 80's!! The design is pretty, but the clasp makes the earring pretty difficult to easily secure. Not a good choice."
2,ok album,"This album is very average. I have most of David Wilcox's albums and greatly enjoy all of them. This is not one of them. It offers nothing new. If looking for a David Wilcox album, look at any other of his wonderful albums..."
5,SUPER!,What a great sense of blues and melody David Wilcox has. He has one of the best voices in the music business. Many of his songs are creative and very meaningful and some are just plain fun!
4,"Vista, By David Wilcox","I enjoy David, and i find this CD to be as good as any of his others, He seems he is in a different space than some of his other CD's however I enjoy it, Now I have also seen him perform this."
3,So So Release,This release left me a little disappointed. I found the first few tracks to have more accompaniment on them than I like to hear from David. The saying that less is more has always held true for me where his songs and accompaniment are concerned. I'm sure as a musician it gets hard to just record with yourself and your guitar but when it gets over-done it feels to busy and some of the early tracks feel that way.The songs themselves were not as revealing as I've come to expect over the years. From his first releases after I listened to a CD I've always felt like I knew something about him. This release felt more impersonal. Songs for the sake of having songs.This release picks up momentum through the middle and carries through the rest of the CD. I wouldn't say Vista is the shinning accoplishment of work in his career but it's not bad it's just so so.
3,Like It!,This does not shut out completely loud noises but it cushions the impact of those noises on your ears. I have worn these out in public on the train to try to block out the people around me and it blocked out 70% of the noise around me.
2,Doesn't seal well enough,"Really isn't giving much protection since I couldn't get it to seal well. One side was a little better than the other, but you only get one shot at doing it right. I wouldn't waste my money trying again.."
3,Just ok.,"Followed instruction, had a nice fit at first. When at the range they became loose.Had to switch to my earmuffs when shooting large caliber rifles."
1,Not what is described or pictured!,"The product name is the ONLY thing accurate about the product description. The description (""Easy, do-it-yourself kit, molds in 10 minutes...."") is about the Radians moldable earplugs (which I was looking for). The picture is of the Radians moldable earplugs as well. Instead, these are the flanged type of earplugs. They do work well, but they are not as pictured or described by any means."
4,Worked Well For Me - Recommended,"Radians ""Custom Molded Earplugs"" were recommended to my son and I by other members of our local Trap Shooting club and we picked these up at a nearby specialty store. I am really glad we didn't see all of the negative reviews posted here or we might have passed on this decent product. Here are my observations:+ Easy To Follow Directions; simple and straight forward, wash your hands and clean your ears out, divide the two different types of putty in half, mix half of each together very thoroughly, mold into ear, wait at least 10 minutes, and remove. Repeat with the rest of the putty for the second ear+ Good Protection; provides enough attenuation for Trap shooting+ Plenty of Putty; enough for two setsThese work well for us and wouldn't hesitate to get more if we need them.Recommended!CFH"
1,They never set,"Followed the directions exactly. Washed my hands and ears (the directions said to do that). Left them in my ears for 40 minutes (no kidding). When I tried to remove them they were just as soft as when I put them in. One plug did not come out completely and got stuck in my ear canal. I managed to get enough out so that I could hear, but there is material still left in my ear."
3,Not what's pictured...,I received ear plugs that look nothing like what is shown in the picture. Buy at your own risk. Not recommended.UPDATE: The seller (BP Medical) apologized for the inaccurate photo and settled the matter agreeably. 1 star for the hassle; 5 stars for taking responsibility for the error.
1,Horrible.,"These things suck, the fit just isn't true enough to protect your hearing. The majority of the mold ends up being in your outer ear - Not fitting to your canal as it should! Cut your (hearing) loss by going to a professional ENT and paying the $150 it takes to have professional quality custom hearing protection."
1,radians custom earplugs,"I was looking for a custom moldable earplug for my bluetooth. Everyone knows what the downside of using the earplugs that come with every bluetooth out there right? So I found this product. It is a 2 part putty much like epoxy, You knead equal parts together then mold it into the ear cavity. Well...after the material cures, the material is still pliable but it doesn't stay together and finally starts to crumble apart. I could not use this product for my intended use let alone for earplugs.the idea is great but I definitely would not recommend this product!"
4,works,"This definitely works however, their instructions to not place too deep in the ear canal should be changed. It took a couple tries with these to get them right so that means I had to order a second set. What I did to get the final pair good, was before inserting into my ear, I rolled a tip so that I could insert a little bit into my ear canal, then push as much as I could to fill my ear as instructed. This produced a mold that is similar to the picture shown, otherwise it will only fill your ear and not your ear canal (which is need to actually suppress any high decible noise like shooting)."
5,Great for custom earbuds,"This is my second time making custom earbuds. (I thought I lost the first set but later found them.) I followed the directions exactly except, after smoothing the stuff in my ear I stick the earbud into it (I used these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EM6AOG and I pulled the silicone tip off first.) After 10 minutes I pulled the whole thing out. About 20 minutes later I use a drill bit (by hand) to make a hole from the ear canal part to the where the earbud attaches."
1,Garbage!! Poor Quality and/or Design,"I Bought these with high hopes of a ""decent"" ear plug. I didn't expect them to work as well as a headset but would be content with equivalent of foam plugs. I followed the instructions EXACTLY as stated on the packaging. Mixed half & half....30 seconds to mix well - then placed in ear as instructed. The instructions noted to leave in ear for a minimum 10 minutes to start the cure them remove if ready - with an additional 3 hours of curing before storage. I left it in my ear for...45 minutes! when I pulled it out, it was like super soft chewing gum. Absolutely useless. I would never try this product again. The absolute bare minimum I would expect is for the product to at least cure!"
1,Does not work!,"I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it from a local store. However, I thought I would do a review of the product here to help others. I followed the instructions to the letter. Dividing both putties in half then combining one colored and one white half until there were no streaks. The instructions state to place them in you ear and then wait at least 10 minutes to set. After 45 minutes they were still runny, about the consistency of gum. I removed them, which wasn't easy, and placed them back in the original containers. After 3 days it's still like Silly Putty. I sent Radians an email from their website and after two days have still not even gotten a response."
1,do not buy,"I purchased some of these and they never set up. Call the manufacturer they told me they have not been selling these for over a year. That they only have a 4 month shelf life. Had to go haven it scraped out of my ear. Seller nor manufacturer would accept any blame. Like I said, do not buy these"
1,Complete waste of time and money.,"I pre-read the instructions, then followed them step by step to the letter, mixing the halves 50/50. Here I sit, writing this review, 1.5 hours later, and I have tan goo running out of my ears that is softer than wet bubble gum. This product does NOT cure. I'd take them back and get a refund, but I don't expect to have any better luck on another batch of the same crap. Do NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!"
3,Good for a while,"They work great at first, but after sitting in your cold car or out in the heat, they tend to shrink. They didn't lock into my ear any more and would always be shifting around, causing the loud sounds to come in."
2,Did not work for me,"I think I did everything right and they seemed to fit and were comfortable, but my ears where ringing when I used them, might be just me but I don't think my ears are a weird size or shape so not sure."
4,Better then others I have tried,This worked a lot better than the variety I can get at my local drug store. I wish I had listened to the recommendations to only use 1/4 of the product per ear because they feel a bit large and fill more of my ear than I would like. On the bright side if I want to try again it is very reasonably priced.Would definitely recommend these.
3,confusing reviews about this album,"This is NOT the album with the best vocal efforts. That album would be ""Better Off Dead""."
5,Heavy as heck with some of the best speed guitar,"This is one of my 10 ""desert island"" CDs- and I'm into all genres of music going back all the way to plainchant. I agree with the previous reviewer in that this Sodom CD sticks out from their catalogue. It's different, even though the same trio put out other albums and EPs. I love all styles of the mighty Sodom, but this one and AGENT ORANGE top my list. Not for closed minds or poseurs- SO BE WARNED!!!!"
3,Definitely a Chicken Soup Book,"This book is not what I was looking for. Guess I should have read the reviews. I am not saying it is not a good book. I was looking for more than a feel good book. Being a heart attack survivor myself and only being 45 years old I was looking for a book on what it feels like to actually survive a heart attack. If you like the Chicken Soup books and want a feel good book I would recommend this book. If you or a loved one has survived a heart attack and want to read from someone who has been there. I would recommend ""An Arrow Through the Heart""."
5,A Handbook for Mental and Physical Health,"Having been working in medical and pharmaceutical research for over 20 years, I have never before come across a handbook for mental and physical health like Heart Attack Survivor: A Field Guide by Brad Hanson. This book gives not only a warm and wise discernment of what is important in daily life, but is also a highly practical guide to how to avoid a too early ending of anyone's life. In the stressful world we are living in, this is a book that should be in everyone's possession. Highly recommended!"
3,"Hard not to dance, but there's even better merengue hip-hop","Ilegales and Proyecto Uno were the two musical ensembles behind the birth of Merengue Hip-Hop, a genre that resulted from the rapping of lyrics over a merengue baseline. This is a music you can't help but dance to, and this album by Ilegales is no exception to that, however, it's not their best. ""Taqui Taqui,"" ""Como Un Trueno"" and ""Dame De Eso"" save the album, but their 'En La Mira' album is far better, and if you want to explore the genre further, don't leave out 'New Era,' by Proyecto Uno as well."
5,Original Style and Goob Creative,"There are ten songs in this CD to enjoying of the best manner, dancing"
1,Waste of money,"I had seen a few clips prior to purchasing this movie, which encouraged me to buy it. However, after seeing the movie in its entirety, I would not buy it again. It is advertised as a comedy, but I didn't find anything funny about it. The content was MUCH dirtier than I had expected based on the clips I had seen, and since it was created before the ratings system, it did not have a rating. I would guess that it would be at least PG-13 if not higher. Overall, a waste of money."
5,Excellent Read,"This books is a great read, it is a wonderful mistery novel that keeps you reading. I have not yet read any Kellerman book that I did not feel this way about."
2,Couldn't put it down..hoping it would get better,"I read the ""hype"" on the book jacket and thought that this book would eventually get better. It didn't. Three quarters of the book draged on and on. Finally the action picked up at the end but I really didn't care at that point. Perhaps if I were into psychiatry I would have found this book more interesting."
2,Love the series,BUT.......this CD book is abridged. I have looked everywhere and haven't found any evidence that it was ever recorded unabridged. What a shame!
2,May never read another of his books,"after managing to get through this one. (And yes, I am an AVP.) I have been a big fan of Kellerman since I stumbled across his work 3 years ago. Have read many since then. But this book was a regretable selection, leaving a very bad taste on the mind. I am still in shock over the savage and nasty ending. He doesn't do Stephen King well at all, shouldn't even try. And it doesn't even make any sense! My best guess? He wrote the first half of the book, got bored as many of us did, and someone else finished it. Ugh!"
4,Jonathan Kellerman does it again,Kellerman's character Alex Delaware once again captures the psychological mystery lover's reading mind. I have read most of Faye Kellerman's Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus detective novels and have now discovered Alex Delaware. I am trying to read the novels in a series to follow the personal history of the characters as well which Kellerman does so masterfully. It is a good read for the crime detective lover!
3,Bizarre,"Very different. It was not one of the most memorable thiller's I read. The characters, however, were well written. I would have never thought the ending would have ended the way it did. Some chapters were very slow, then picked up. Twisted plot, but kept me going."
3,Alex to the rescue,"Melissa was just 7 when she dialed a help line and found comfort and therapy with psychologist Alex Delaware. Now she's 18 and needs him more than ever.Her severely phobic mother has vanished and may be the victim of a vengeful assailant. Alex uncovers funny goings-on, even among the doctors who are supposed to be healing Melissa's mother."
4,Good character development,I liked this book a lot. It had a good amount of relationship issues in here and I enjoy that. I found it interesting to see the relationship between the mother and daughter change and to see the daughter make sense of her mother. Alex Deleware is a great character. Jonathan Kellerman has kicked out another good book! You easily get caught up in the characters lives. Kellerman draws you in. I could barely wait to find out what happens in the next chapter!
4,A GREAT psychological thriller!!,"This was the second of many book I have read by Jonathan Kellerman, and isthe best to date. Kellerman shows his expertise in psychology and suspense in thispage turner. I could not put this book down, andlost a lot of sleep trying to finishit. You'll learn more about a phobic personality thanyou ever thought possible, andyou'll have a great time doing it. Tou may have yourown list of suspects by the end,but you'll never figure this ending out!!<BR"
2,Better once I started skimming,"(2.5 Stars) Having never read anything by Kellerman, I was recommended the Alex Delaware books by a friend who doesn't read anything too heavy. I came in hopeful, but that quickly diminished into hope that something interesting would eventually come out of this novel. I was 100 pages into it when I was about to give up, when my wife suggested skimming. I started doing this and finally around page 150, a mystery finally appeared. I continued skimming and by the time I got to page 300, I was back into actually reading it word for word. In the end, I really wish I had spent my time reading something else."
3,It was okay....,"AUDIO/ABRIDGED: First, John Rubinstein did a great narration, he always does. This one is part of the Alex Delaware series, very early on. A teen, who was Alex's patient 11-years earlier for anxiety, comes to see Alex when she dreads going off to school. He mother has a phobia of leaving the house and soon disappears. It was only three discs and I did feel like I was missing a few things. Milo is wonderful, as usual and you hear the first of Alex and Robin briefly getting together. I did have problems with how Alex finds the murderer's lair, but I was listening to it in my car. The end was far-fetched and I was glad it ended quickly. Otherwise, it was okay."
3,Wasn't my favorite,"The Alex Delaware series is always an enjoyable escape. It's certainly not ""heavy"" literature, nor was this my favorite book in the series, but it's readable."
5,b,Delivery was timely as promised. The item was the exact quality promised. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
3,Okay,"I really like Tim Allen, but this seems to be a remake of Home Improvement. He's still the macho guy, with three daughters instead of three sons."
5,Last Man Standing,"Makes me laugh and be happy!However just a short preview was all I saw, as perhaps I did not operate the Amazon program correctly. Need to work on this!"
2,Television for women belongs on Lifetime TV,"Belongs on the Lifetime TV network, television for women, not much else here. Has the form of Home Improvement just written for women."
3,Not Spectacular,"I've enjoyed every week of this first season of Last Man Standing, but this episode wasn't as entertaining as the earlier ones.In the main plot, government bureaucrats threaten to cut down a tree in the family's front yard, so the battle begins. The humor around a bureaucratic battle struggled to connect, and this week's dialogue felt more forced than before.The side plot, Mandy's meeting with her idol, Kim Kardashian, was entertaining but brief. Since Mandy has spent all season emulating the Kardashian icon, it was great to have Kim make a guest appearance, but the episode spent little time on that part of the plot.If you've watched the whole season and gotten to know the characters, watch this one as a continuation of their lives. But don't let this be the first episode of Last Man Standing that you watch -- start at the beginning, when the humor was much more effective."
4,Funny...Just Like the Whole Season,"Tim Allen's Last Man Standing continues to entertain. Like Home Improvement before it, this show focuses on two things: the family life and the work life of Allen's character, here named Mike.At work, Mike is a man among men, literally ... working in an outdoor supply shop. So the work scenes in this episode bring one of Allen's daughters in as an intern, to mix things up. Mandy, the middle daughter, may have finally found her niche in marketing for the shop.At home, Mike's wife Vanessa struggles to balance work and life after her new promotion. As she's studying and preparing presentations, Mike takes over some of the housework.This episode isn't quite the laugh-track that some of the episodes have been, but it works harder to develop the characters. Vanessa and Mike's marriage gets some attention, as does their relationship to their youngest daughter, Eve."
3,Where's the DVD,Love the show but have absolutely NO interest whatsoever in instant view. Will wait for the DVD full season release. Where's the DVD release?
5,'Last Man Standing' is a HIT!!!!,"Finally! A funny and contemporary comedy. Brilliant actors, crazy funny writing....I'm in. It is refreshing compared to what is out there now. I seriously can't wait for season 1 on dvd. I get the giggles and look forward to a brightening of my week. Take a peek, you'll be hooked!"
5,A must for any youngster who has spent more than the minimum time playing with a Tonka truck.,"Many a young child has developed a fondness for the massive machines that construct the world's buildings. ""Bob the Builder On Site: Bob's World Meets the Real World - Houses & Playgrounds"" takes the critically acclaimed Bob the Builder children's series as the characters go and show children how their homes are built and how the playgrounds they enjoy so much are constructed. Educational as it is entertaining for youngsters, ""Bob the Builder On Site"" is a must for any youngster who has spent more than the minimum time playing with a Tonka truck."
2,Not worth purchasing,"Thought the book would be about a different way to preserve/press flowers and leaves. Nope. It's literally about hammering them so the dye imprints on a porous material. Some plants' dye apparently fades sooner than others so she recommends painting over those. You also need to be able to access a wide variety of petals and leaves if you want to pound an image like a fairy (which I don't). I guess it's my fault for not understanding what the book was about. I guess if you like hammering vegetation, buy the book. Otherwise, find it in the library or look online."
3,The Art of Punding Flowers,This book is quite basic in layout and ideas..but it does show beginners how to have fun with this craft.I have done some of this is in the past so there was not anything new to me in this book...the list of flowers used is also not very large but good for people starting out.
4,A fun read!,"I read this book in a weekend, it was so fun to read. I felt like I'd met people just like the characters, and really appreciated the whole story. I've felt the same things these characters have felt. Mr. Somers has written an entertaining book that I'm loaning to a friend of mine, which I don't often do. I loved the narrator, Dub - his attitude was very funny! Definitely a recommended read."
2,Lifers comes off Stale,"I like Jeff Somers, I have the physical collection and the kindle collection of his Avery Cates stories and I was expecting something different. And while you can certainly tell its the same writer these characters have a very similar vocalization to Avery Cates. It's the same reason I like and dislike David Eddings. The characters don't change much from each book.The book is engaging and reads quickly so it does its job of drawing a person in but I just couldn't divorce his other stories in my head. I'd still tell people to read this author, just not sure I'd tell them to start with this story."
2,eh...,"My senior year i had to pick this book for an economics project... bad choice. I do like how there are boxes placed every so often with little stories/parables/facts etc. thats pretty nice i'll say, but the rest is repetitive bi***in, depressing, whining information that does interest me in the least. i think i'm better off going and reading some harry potter books."
5,Klyd Watkins has accomplished a quiet miracle with Ghost Tr,"Klyd Watkins has accomplished a quiet miracle with Ghost Trees. Long poems are frequently difficult to follow, their lines leading into obtuse cul-de-sacs, and petering out in the midst of weeds and brambles, but the poetic path he has established here pulls the eyes and brain and heart of even the casual reader along with him as he traverses the earthily ethereal trails winding around the shores of his chosen subject, Radnor Lake. His lines crackle with energy; he has great fun with the language. At times, Watkins almost appears to be dancing widdershins just a few steps ahead of us, a pastoral Tennessee Gandalf exercising his laughing craft to free the everyday eternity locked in wood and water. Ghost Trees is a short but significant vision quest from which the reader will not return untouched or unchanged. --C Ra McGuirt, Editor, Penny Dreadful Review"
3,Not really a fan,"Did not really enjoy this Xanth Book, I think from here on out the series goes downhill and is pretty much just a money grab."
3,It was O.K,"Having read all of the earlier ""Incarnations of Immortality"" series I was anxious to find more books by Piers Anthony.""Night Mare did not live up to my expectations maybe this is just the weak link in the series (there is always one you must admit) and I will try the others.It seemed to me as if this book showed good promise but got bogged down trying to impress a younger audience."
4,Fun and Magical - As always!!,"Another Piers Anthony masterpiece. I loved the book and had to read it all in one day to find out what happened to the Kings of Xanth. Mare Imbrium, the Night Mare (turned Day Mare) is a fantastic character to lead this book and Piers Anthony has a fantastic view of life, even when he's a horse!! There is suspence not only to discover whether Xanth will survive but to find out if Mare Imbrium and the Day Horse are destined to be together.Yet another fantastic book full of fun and puns. Piers has a way of looking at the world that no one else has, but that everyone appreciates."
4,Great new character,"Here we are introduced to Imbrium a night mare and her sire, The Night Stallion. Imbri was a night mare, a bringer of bad dreams who seems to have lost here edge after acquiring half of a soul. The Night Stallion retires her from dream duty and sends her on a mission, a mission which would save Xanth."
5,One of the best books i've ever read!!!!!!!!,I have read most of the Zanith novels and Nightmare of course was among them. Piers Anthony knows what it takes to make a truely great novel. Nightmare is a book that is really hard to put down without wondering what will happen next? I have got to hurry up and find out.Once you start reading it it's like watching a movie unfold before your eye's.There is no way anyone that loves SciFi could ever be unsatisfied with the Novel NightMare. It is truely A work of art.
4,Great!,"I bought this for my niece who is a fan of the wiggles,she is 17 months old and wiggles video catch her attention,I bought several DVDs and she like them all!Good buy!"
3,A Wiggly Disappointment,"We own all of the Wiggles videos and have even bought some from their Australian homeland! We love their music and dances! When we saw that this new Christmas video was coming out, I pre-ordered it right away! It was so disappointing! The songs were annoying and the children who have appeared in every video have been replaced! Maybe if it is your first try at the Wiggles, you will be happy with this purchase, but Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas is the much better choice in our eyes! But to be fair, our 2 year old loves it just as he does all of the others!"
2,Not really...,"My 22 month old absolutely adores the Wiggles, and is mesmerized by most of their shows...except this one...there is a lot of singing and dancing, but it moves at a much slower pace than some of their others. For my toddler, it's the colorful, fast-paced, upbeat shows that he prefers, not the ones showing them sitting around a Christmas tree singing mellow songs, with the children swaying their heads to the beat. Also, my son is not impressed with children in costumes dancing on stage....he only wants to see THE WIGGLES dancing around and singing!! While I really do appreciate the multicultural, and especially the CHRISTIAN emphasis of this show, he does not!"
4,Good as long as it is not your first Wiggles tape...,"All of us, from age 40 down to 2, are huge Wiggles fans. This is cute if you already like the Wiggles, but lacks that ""chemistry"" that emanates from the others. I expected more conventional Christmas songs, but instead this is filled with Wiggles originals, which are fine once you learn them yourself. Bonus educational feature: a reminder that Christmas is in the summer time Down Under! A good opportunity to have a little geography lesson and exposure to other cultures."
3,Buy Wiggly Wiggly Christmas instead!,"We own 6 wiggles videos/DVD's and I'd rank this one near the bottom; there are only two recognizeable Christmas songs on it. The others are original wiggles songs which is nice, but not what we thought we were getting; My son watches Wiggly Wiggly Christmas every day (sometimes twice, if we let him) during the season but actually walked out of the room when we put this one in.There are good parts: One highlight is authentic Irish singing/dancing and a very funny ""singing lesson"" with Captain Feathersword which even gave me the giggles.On the whole, though, if you're looking for a Christmas video, buy WWC - this one doesn't have as much heart."
2,Not the best of the Wiggles,"We were quite disappointed with this, especially after watching Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas. I would definitely recommend buying it instead!!!!"
2,Positively Bad,"I am sorry but Yule Be Wiggling should be based on current Christmas songs sung by the Wiggles. My kids normally love the wiggles but wouldn't even watch Yule Be Wiggling for more than 5 minutes. Apparently the songs done are not ones the kids hear ever so their was no interest in watching it. Hearing a song that they normally listen to keeps their attention, but this did not."
3,A different kind of Wiggles.,"Okay, I was very excited to see this Wiggles Christmas tape but, my son was not into this tape. As others have noted, the dancing is not like in previous Wiggles video. It is much harder for a child to follow and perform. The music is ok some classics in there. I was a little disappointed in that it didn't follow the more child friendly format that the Wiggles are accustommed to."
5,Best of the 3 Wiggles Christmas DVDs,This one is my favorite of the 3 Christmas DVDs the Wiggles have out! It's very educational about Christmas around the world and what Christmas day is like. My favorite part is when Morgan Crowley is teaching Capt. Feathersword to sing and the Capt. is singing Jingle Bells and is going back to his 'screaming' voice when Morgan isn't looking. It's hilarious! My daughter and step son both LOVE this movie! I don't think they'll let me pack it back up with the Christmas stuff!
3,So-So Wiggles,"This wasn't as good as some of the other Wiggles videos, but my daughter still liked some of the songs. The Santa looked ridiculous and there were too many special effects, which made it look busy."
1,"Mama No, me no like it!","My 2 yrs old who is absolutely in love with wiggles, did not like this one at all. Some songs are so slow it puts us to sleep. It is just too boring.He would only watch it for maybe one song and turns it off."
1,Yule be wasting your time & money,"It seems that the people who made this holiday special don't know what the heck Yule is. Yule is a celebration every December on the longest night of the year and welcomes the returning of the Sun. It was celebrated WAY before Christmas ever came into being and, in fact, a lot of things used in Christmas are taken from it. (The tree, the lights, the wreaths, the gifts, etc.) As my 5 year old and I watched this horrible Wiggle dvd (rented, thank goodness) she asked when they were going to do something about Yule. (It turns out the whole thing is nothing but Christmas stuff!) We were both shocked and disappointed to say the least. I guess this would be an okay dvd if you were into Christmas, but otherwise I wouldn't recommended to anyone who celebrates Yule."
5,"The best price, by far.","I looked at numerous sources, and this was the best price, by far. 40% better in several examples. I'll know where to look next time."
3,i love tekken but...,"i love this game but just comepare this to tekken tag, or even the first tekken.. its gona be tough playing on the gameboy with 2 buttons on the plate and the R and L buttons.. and only 9 characters!.. not even the 9 best characters.. whats going on?!we'll see about geting this game..."
5,I KNOW This Game is Going to Rock!!!,"This game is going to be a hit on the GBA system I just know it. I love the Tekken series and I'm going to be one of the first ones to buy it. I know, from a little research, that you can only play nine charicters, plus one little ""suprise"", from Tekken 3. If you love the Tekken series as much as I do, then I would highly advise you tou pre-order this, ""Butt-Kicking-To-Go"" handheld game."
4,"Great game, but i wanted more...","Now that I have actually played and bought the game, i can safely say Tekken deserves the 4 stars i gave it. The gameplay is similar enought to T3 so that T3 players can jump right in. I found the new controls to be more ""user friendly"" than the four button and joystick scheme. I can finally pull off 10 hit combos and certain quickie moves. One thing i liked about the character roster: i was familiar with all of those characters (two things: no more Eddy ""cheapo"" Gordo!!). I would've liked to see True Ogre, Julia Chang, and Bryan Fury. Maybe there'll be a sequel (are you listening, Namco?!!)"
1,Not cool,"I myself am a die hard tekken fan, and i asked for this game for christmas one year. I was so happy, until i played it. The graphics are horrible for one thing (but what do u expect from GBA). Only 10 of the Characters are in it, but u can only play as 9 of them! They're Nina, Hwoarang, Paul, Gun-Jack, Law, Jin, Ling, King, and Lei, Hehiachi is the unplayable boss. If you are undecided, please DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!! thank u"
4,who would of thought,that this...game could be so good it has its downs but the ups out way the downsups...one of the best fighting gameshas LAW my fav. fightergraphicsall the different modesdownsonly 1 secret fighternot all the people from tekenso i think this really deserves a 4.75 for lack of fighters but it is still alot of bang for your buck but i would of paid an extra $10 to have all the fighters in it
3,Low Tech-Ken,"I've learned firsthand that you've ever bought a GBA port of a fighting game, you'd get what you paid for. With that in mind, I discovered and snatched a copy of ""Tekken Advance."" Of course it pales in comparsion to console versions because of the limited hardware, but you get the gist of what they're like if you don't own them already.While the GBA's 4-button layout compromises the gameplay, you get a ton of moves that are easy to pull off against a fairly balanced AI. Plus you can rotate around the psuedo-3D platforms. A minor nuisance is that if you, say, land a suplex, you get this ugly one-second cutscene. A major nuisance is that ""TA"" needs an extra cartridge for vs battles, missing the GBA's multiplayer capabilities. Man cannot live on 9 characters and 6 game modes alone.This game is rated T for Teen: Violence."
4,Tekken,"Tekken is probaly 1 of the best games for GBA. With many charecters, this fighting game has superb grahics and some knock out replays in slow-mo. As a gamer, I have seen a lot of good games, but Tekken one one of the best games I ever played. With people and even a creature of steel have jaw dropping combos and attacks. Each person and creature have there own experences. Like the chinese fighters are fast, aggresive, and use karati, judo, and tiqando moves. This is a great choise of about 1,000 games. BUY IT"
4,One Tight handheld game,it rocks it is a complete game.it has great graphics.killer moves.and a now low price.good side:Good graphics.low price.replay.Bad side:the grahpics get pixeled when it zooms in.it's hard to find.theres only one secret character.this game pob has the best graphics for gba.it's fun and has a very high replay value.YOU GOTTA GET THIS GAME!!!
4,For the price.......,"Regardless of the make, I have never heard decent sound from a notebook computer.For around $20 that can be rectified. The bass is remarkable from such a small set of speakers, and the aural placement of the music, or whatever, is tight and natural.I doubt they would adequately fill a large dance hall with sound, but they will sure raise the intelligence of the sound for your computer.I also have these on my desktop.You can't go wrong."
3,Good for the money,"I received and set it up yesterday and my initial impression is it's OK. I don't believe that price effects performance, so I'm not going to give it 5 stars because it only costs x dollars. It's better than I expected but it doesn't sound great. For $15-$20, it's about as good as you can expect, so if this is your price range, then I recommend it.Setup was easy except it was overpackaged. There were too many wrappers and ties that needed to be torn/undone. I needed scissors to cut through plastic tape. It's very easy to operate. There's a power button and a volume knob. It about as intuitive at it gets. I prefer this over a single volume knob that has to be clicked on since I can save the volume setting with a separate power button.Overall 3 stars. Value for the $ 4.5 stars."
3,kinda get what you pay for,"The sound quality isn't great but I didn't expect much for 9 dollars, or whatever. One thing though, the speakers are supposed to be black, it even says black on the box, but they're off white-ish grey. Oh well. Not terrible, overall."
1,I would rate this speaker NEGTIVE FIVE star if I could,"Dear friends,buy this product if you don't mind having crappy speakers that cracks constantly and picks up the noise from electric current as soon as you turn it on. I mean to be fair, of course I am not expecting sound quality from high-end audio systems that are more then ten times pricier, but trust me, these speakers sucks so bad that they don't even worth a couple bucks. If you don't trust me, then go ahead and buy it. But don't regret that you are not warned!"
3,alright,great deal for the price deff. doesnt produce the bass like i thought other than that it is great for easy listening but not for loud or stuff that has alot of bass has good quality clear sound.
1,cheapest speakers ever made,Speakers look and sound cheap. Sound is very tinny. I gave them as a gift and was very embarrassed when I saw and heard them used.
4,i Like it,This is a good set of speakers. It makes listening to music on my pc more entertaining. The subwoofer works really good and is putting out a very good sound.
3,"Okay sound, but not for entertaining.","The sound is okay for small computer sounds. Doesn't really give you as much sound you'd like for gaming or music. It's alright, but I would suggest another brand. Seller is great."
3,cyber acoustics CA-3001RB,"If you turn the volume on too much, it gets so annoying..The sound quality is ok up to half volume level...but, for high sound volumes, you hear lots of annoying vibrations and it feels like the woofer will going to explode..This product should be purchased only for places where you are not supposed to listen to music loud..Because, for low and medium sound levels, it offers good quality.."
4,pretty much amazing,so basically...i needed some bass to liven up my dorm room...and this product gave me what i wanted...the quality of the speakers is amazing and i am LOVING the subwoofer (although my neighbors may not be)
4,Awesome for the price,"I pulled this out of the package and was worried--the speakers all seemed small and pretty flimsy. However, I was literally amazed at how well it sounded once I turned it on--I don't know if I've ever heard better-sounding speakers for the price. Surprisingly solid bass, especially."
1,((((((((((((((( SUCK'S )))))))))))))))))),I have only had mine about 4 r 5 month's now & they r a piaece of shi****** don't spend your money on these !!!!!!!!!!.My subwoofer has stopped working all together now & about half the time the 2 small speakers have so much destortion in them u can't hardly understand the sound that they are suppose to be makeing.
1,Worked wonderfully -- for 18 months,"I really did love these speakers. They were just what I was looking for -- something that could handle the epic soundtracks of movies and video games. I used them pretty much daily for 18 months.And then without warning, they died. Completely fried.I'm looking into something more reliable, and I'm willing to pay higher."
1,So dissapointing,"When I first ordered these speakers I was so excited, upon receipt I was so disappointed. They were very small and cheaply made. Be warned that they are described as satellite speakers witch may lead you to believe they are wireless but they are not. Probably a good purchase for your kids but grown ups will not be satisfied, well I was not."
4,Not Bad for the Price,"I bought these speakers for a computer system I was building about two years ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by the sound. They're not the highest quality speakers in the world but, for the price, they get the job done. They gets decent bass from the subwoofer, and good sound overall (though the sound quality has deteriorated a bit over time - I'm looking to upgrade them now). My one big complaint about these speakers is that they seem to pick up a LOT of interference from cell phones, which can be annoying.Overall, I give these speakers 4 stars. They have their limitations, but you really can't beat them at this price."
1,Subwoofer Stopped Working,"Initially, I was impressed with sound for such inexpensive speakers. But, after only a few months the subwoofer and front LED light both stopped working. They sound terrible without a subwoofer -- like fingernails scratching a chalkboard. Now I'll have to spend more money to get something reliable. Don't get suckered by this speakers, they are no more than a trinket."
2,Good while it last,i brought this system and it worked great the sound quality was good the sub woofer had a lot of thump for such a small sub woofer but a about a month after usage the speaker started to short circuit then the sub woofer was started to lose its thump if you want something to last for a while i wouldnt suggest this product
2,You get what you pay for,"I brought this a while ago. It still barely works. It has a short in it but even before the short, it was a horrible choice. I mean if you want something cheap and loud go for it. But these speakers pick up interference from EVERYTHING electronic. (The noise it makes is annoying) --me and my roommate made a game out of it every time it buzzes we know one of our phones is going to ring-. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this. Not a good deal."
4,Nice system for the money,"Nice sounding system for a little bit of money. Diminutive speakers. No tone control. Bass distortion when played at high volume, but all can be overlooked when the price is considered. I give it a thumbs up."
2,"Weak sound, not junk but...",Not better than junky PC speakers. The subwoofer seems to have stopped working but I'm not sure why. Oh well.
2,Cheap Quality Sound,Though cheap I have heard better sound for such a price. Do not buy the product. The subwoofer is really bad. Satellite speakers are ok.. So buy only satellite speakers which will be cheaper. The subwoofer sound is really irritating.
3,Cyber Acoustics CA-3001RB,"After a period of use, quality gradually become good. This is a cheap products, it is very cost-effective.Cannot demand with many!"
1,Broken Subwoofer,I've only had these speakers for 6 months and the subwoofer has already stopped working. These speakers are cheap but they are also flimsy and have poor workmanship. Spend the few extra bucks and get something better.
2,Lack of shielding is a major problem,"I'm giving these 2 stars because the sound is not horrible, although you certainly should not expect deep sub-bass or high-quality sound.The real problem is the lack of shielding. As others have noted, the speakers pick up radio frequency interference. Mine make a -loud- and very alarming noise a fraction of a second before my cell phone rings or gets a text message. They also make a strange sound when airplanes fly overhead. Additionally, I get a low hum from them when music is not playing.Since these are not sheilded, they may also cause problems (interference) with CRT monitors, but I cannot verify this as I have LCD's.All in all, I would definitely NOT recommend these."
2,"Good Sound, Easily broken","I have used these speakers for over a year. It has great sound, however, it's given me more frustrating moments than I can count. If the wire is not correctly positioned, sound from the left speaker will not function. The subwoofer also disconnects at times. This can get incredibly annoying day after day. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and bought a new speaker set."
4,solid,"These speakers give you great bass & sound (unless you want to break glass) for their small size and are really cheap. Perfect for mp3 player, which is what I use mine for. They do pick up static when a cell phone is being used, or just before it's about to ring. Also, your whole room will have pale blue light if you try to play them as you're falling asleep at night. My previous roommate loved them too and decided to buy her own speakers once I moved out. Besides the light, I couldn't be happier with them!"
2,"Spend a little more, don't buy this!","Ok, you can't go wrong with 20 bucks, right? Wrong!The sound quality is so-so. Not terrible, but not too great either. The mids are not full enough, which perhaps is expected from speakers of this price range. The subwoofers are reasonable. Overall, the sound quality, while not great, are still deserving of 4 stars because of the price factor.The reason I am giving it 2 stars is the ANNOYING sound it makes every few minutes, just before a cell phone is going to ring, or there is some electrical disturbance, and sometimes for reasons unknown to me (perhaps a cell phone 20 feet away!). There is no shielding whatsoever. The noise is highly disturbing, and EXTREMELY loud (it doesnt matter if the speaker volume is turned down). I was actually woken up from sleep last night by a terrible screech it made around 1 AM. In short, it has made the speakers unusable for my purposes and I am going to return them today."
1,Not worth the money,"These speakers are small, but very tinney and way underpowered. Spend a little more and get someting you will be happy with. They are not in any way an improvement on internal laptop speakers."
4,Tasteful Collection of Tunes,A collection of tastefully written songs performed by a guy whose moody guitar playing reeks of promise. (Kudos to the rhythm section also.) I hope that Jett has the opportunity to work with a deserving producer on a full-length release.
5,Awesome dynamics and atmosphere!,On 'Fragment' Jett really demonstrates great melodic composition and dynamics. I had thoughts of U2 in some spots for sure. Great tonal range as well. This is a man who knows his way around a studio too. Excellent and unique voice as well!
1,Simply awful,"I'm not sure if this book has a single original thought. The authors flaunt the fact that they used Amazon.com's rating system and bought and read the top 20 self-help books then summarized them. All you get for your money are brief snippets that are nearly useless without context which were outright stolen from other people's work. This book is 134 pages and 15 of those pages are synopsis and opinion on OTHER self-help books.If you read the original works instead of this ludicrous summary you will get far more out of it. I highly recommend ""Getting Things Done"", ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"", and ""Unclutter Your Life"". (The first two were ripped off so much in this book that I was simply appalled.)"
4,"Perfect ,Quick and Easy Guide !!",I recommended it !! I like much no need over 300 page for good guide. Also it come with appendices for buy a book and some recommended books! Is concise and direct to point !
2,The 25 Best Time Management Tools & Techniques,I was not impressed with the value of the ideas in this book. Very basic information that most people already know. I would suggest finding a book with more original ideas than this one. The authors say they read the top 20 time management books on Amazon and took ideas from those books. I would prefer an author that had some ideas based on thier own experience or on some new ideas they might have and then I might get something new. Pass on this one!
4,Want more time in your 24 hour day?,"In this easy to read book, you can learn how to make your life, business and home run more practically, with more organization, thus causing you less stress, and letting you get more done. If you are looking for a way to add more hours to your day, this is the book for you.Pam and Doug outline specific tools you can use to manage your time and energy creating the success and peace of mind we all need!"
3,Easy read but you will need to dig deeper,"This book is some type of a summery of other time management books.if you do not like to read long books or do not have the time to you may consider reading this book you will get a lot of good tips here and the author is providing references to other books for more research .I feel that ""lack of detail"" is the main issue with this book other than this it is a good book."
4,"A great ""to the point"" summary of techniques",Very easy to read and summarizes some great techniques for getting more out of the precious hours of the day.
1,"Unless you truly are desperate, this is not a book to spend money on","Twenty-five best time management tools and techniques? I'd say there are about four here. Number 17, for example is about a half-page: ""Take risks."" Thanks, very informative.Another of my ""favorites"" is # 19: ""Hold Better Meetings"", where it advises you on the first of the two pages (well not quite two pages) to ""hold meetings in atypical places...at a local low-key restaurant."" Then two bullets later it advises not to serve food because ""it adds unneeded cost, calories and distraction.""I would say that if tips like ""follow up on outstanding items"" are eye-opening to you, and this is the only book you can buy, then it's OK to let money go for it. Otherwise, I would suggest David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"", or Alec MacKenzie's ""The Time Trap""."
3,Good R&B Gospel Music,"The album as a whole is pretty good as I have always admired the production style of this project. I'm fond of a few key tracks, most notably ""Runnin'"" which I really wish was a longer track."
2,TASTE NOT GOOD,"I bought this at costco for $10 b/c (pack of 8), its organic and I like to eat soup before bed.There are 2 kinds, beans and pasta soups. Both are not good, trust me. Taste like old soup sitting for a long time.Don't buy"
4,mild flavor,The lentil soup has a mild flavor which can be spruced up with any spices. My only dissapointment is that the packaging is poor and over half the cans came severely dented.
2,Made in a facility that processes milk...,"I bought this because it said vegan on the can. I enjoy Amy's products although this particular one gave me an allergic reaction. I am allergic to dairy products and thought that this would be safe. Halfway through with my dinner I got that taste in my mouth that only comes from milk. I wish that this company were to separate the equipment that they use to make items that are considered ""Gluten Free"", ""Vegan"", etc. I noticed the reaction and then double checked the can to see that they do in fact state that the facility does process milk, wheat, soy, tree nuts and seeds. Perhaps someone at the company will read this review and consider changing their preparation procedures as I will no longer buy any other Amy's product"
4,"Too bland, needs to be spiced up.","I am all for healthy soups, but the taste of this one is far too bland. I added some sea salt, peppercorns and roasted seaweed to make it palatable. The end result is pretty good, thus the four stars, otherwise it would've gotten one."
1,Tasteless,"I love the regular version of this soup, and accidentally bought a case of the low-sodium version. No amount of added salt improves the overwhelming blandness of this product."
3,"Pretty good, not spicy","I tried this out looking for low sodium soups and found it to be pretty good. It is not that spicy, and has a large amount of carrots in it. (Wish about 3/4 of the carrots was more lentil's)I add some jalapenos or tobasco to it when heating it up to give it a little more bite."
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The actual item does not look as good as the photograph. It was definitely not worth the money spent for it and was very ""cheap"" looking. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I will not purchase from this vendor again."
3,Good Bathroom book,This book is hilarious and gives you the basic rules and regs and history of the great holiday of Festivus.The bad thing is that about half the book is made up of stories just to fill enough pages to justify an entire book. You could probably get the same info from a page or two off the internet. The book is so short I read it in about an hour! It was funny though.
2,Not great,"Most of the book is taken up with the family transcripts of their Festivus celebration. Lots of inside jokes and stories that are just not that amusing to read. Who wants to watch some other family's home movies, you know? I appreciate the history of Festivus, it was an interesting look into this family, but the book was not worth $12.95 and if you can buy any other book, buy something else. It's just not worth it."
4,Christmas Warmth and Happiness,"A book containing stories by my favorite authors makes for a wonderful taste of Christmas. All are beautifully written, as would be expected from five of the most experienced Regency writers around, and the feel-good factor is as plentiful as the holly and mistletoe. If I have to choose a winner, the elf gets to the line first! Sandra Heath's Bramble Bumblekin made me laugh while he played my heartstrings, but Amanda McCabe's partridge fluttered up fast on the inside rail, with the other three neck-and-neck for third place."
5,You're reviewing the wrong book!,"The book reviewed here is not the book above! That one was published in 1998. The book above, A REGENCY CHRISTMAS #9, was just published in October 2002.So the reviews listed here don't apply - different authors, different stories."
3,Good light reading!,"*** Five short Regency romances, set during the Christmas season. Each with a loving message. I enjoyed each one, but my favorite involved a puppy. I will say no more. You will have to read the book to understand.Within these pages you will catch the Christmas spirit, discover romance, and feel the magic which surrounds the season.Recommended for light reading..."
5,Chia Seed IS a miracle of nature,"Well, ""they"" say that the ancients knew best! In the case of chia, that appears to be true. One thing that chia seeds delivers, is boron, which helps transfer calcium to the bones. The author of the Magic of Chia does an excellent job of explaining the historical significance of chia seed, along with its nutritional value. You need to read this one, and start eating it, as I do!"
2,"Chia good, book, bad","I became a Chia fan after reading the book Born to Run and then tried it myself. I wanted to learn more and bought this book. There is some very obtuse history and botony, and some anectodatal, kind of related, medical information, bordering on snake oil salesmanship at times....Chia can cure everything. The recipies at the end are simplistitic and lack originality. The author seems to be knowledgable, but seems to be holding back information for some reason. I will continue looking for better books on Chia."
3,"Not much out there on chia, so this may be the best of the bunch","Small book with primarily historical information. I wanted more recipes than this has to offer. Guess I'll stick with my own drink formulation (water, 2 tablespoons chia seeds and either orange, lemon or lime -- all the fruit except for seeds and peel -- sweetener to taste, whizzed in the blender to pulverize and mix it all. And, if you leave it too long, the chia gets gelatinous which I don't find particularly pleasant. I prefer the tiny seeds since I just chug it anyway.) I find the beverage mix filling, but the process of cleaning the blender is a bit of a disincentive, especially if I've let the seeds get gelatinous and sticky. My other planned use is on top of the ""no knead"" artisan bread loaves."
4,Find out about CHIA,Chia is one of the best kept seacrets in the health food field. This book gives you a complete rundown on what Chia is all about.
5,Chia for Everyone,"This book was very informative and interesting. Writer is concise, accurate and verifies his information. This truly is a breakthrough in modern health, and the whole world would do well to learn from it. Most especially Western culture of processing food."
4,"Good Intro Book, Could use more recipes","This book was really interesting, I really liked that the author spent time in the southwest and with Native Americans and described the folklore and culture surrounding the seeds.It really could have used more recipes to show the versatility of the seed."
4,I thought it would have other information,"I was hoping it would have more input on usage in different ways,otherwise the book was very good on the recipes."
4,These speakers are well made for certain areas,"I purchased these speaker at walmart for 20$ they sound decent depending on what you want you want to use them for. There not made to be loud although they can sound fairly loud when playing music or dvds, or even games. When you turn the speakers up all the way they tend to make a type of rattling sound/buzzing sound. So if your wanting loud speakers dont buy these. Although they do sound good for instant messgaing music,things that dont require alot of bass or really high pitch. But these speakers are worht the 20$ for your tipical computer uses."
3,"Sounds good, but buzzes at high volumes","The speakers are pretty decent for the money.I just picked them up because I just wanted a cheap pair to hold me over for a little while. The sound quality is decent. Not a lot of bass obviously, but decent.However, if you turn the volume up more than halfway, you start hearing a constant buzzing sound which gets louder as you increase volume. A bit annoying.But again, fo the money they aren't terrible."
2,Can't play loudly,"The speakers have a rating of 5 watts RMS, not ten as stated above. The sound is decent only at the lowest of levels - at least on my computer. They can't play loudly without considerable distortion."
4,desktop speakers,"i bought these because i have another creative speaker setup 2 speakers that is nlike these but the sound is better in the other set. still price was good so i'd give them a 4 of 5,because they don't wow me."
5,Great kitchen tool!,"I really like this Kitchen Aid tool.""Who needs a spoon/spatula combination?"" you ask? I know that I do! Rachael Ray would call this a ""spoonula"" and I find it incredibly useful.The most current version of this item is here:KitchenAid Silicone Spoon Spatula, Black""What should I use this for?"" My answer is: everything you can! This is definitely an omlette's best friend. I also use it often when sauteeing - probably almost as often as I use a wooden spoon.This is also useful when baking - it makes a great bowl scraper, and I will often use it like a spatula in this capacity.Should you buy it? Absolutely!"
5,Good tool,"I started buying these instead of the old rubber type as they are multi-functional. Can be used for baking or to get things out of jars, in addition to cooking with them due to their temperature toleration. A big plus (at least so far) is that they do not break down as the rubber ones did and become sticky/tacky."
4,not her best work but still a fun read,"As far as I know this is Lawana Blackwell's first novel. She does a pretty good job. This first book tends to lean towards the stereotypical romance novel, though. The characters follow the usual pattern for romance novels. The character development is low. But luckily, Lawana Blackwell gets better with each novel she writes. I particularly like her Gresham Series. Good work, Lawana."
2,Sony theater set woofer,"Purchased Sony home theater set three months ago. Woofer started a quiet ""buzz"" sound and quit altogether shortly thereafter. No indication of power LED to item. Going back to store, hope thay can replace or fix. Long drive!"
2,This software is poorly done,"Math Missions is an okay investment. It doesn't do what I needed it to do which is basic addition. The easy levels are too easy and the next level jumps to 3 digit addition. Where is the kindergarten and 1st grade addition and subtraction problems? The way it is set up is not straightfroward...I can't believe this is the best they can do these days.Another problem is that you have to complete things in each area/shop/etc before you can ""go to the arcade"". The problem is it doesn't say how many time or how much you need to do in each part, so a child can't figure out exactly what needs to be done.There is no way a K or 1st grader can navigate alone. My daughter is pretty computer savy and she kept asking for help.However, It is better than a regular video game. I have yet to find a game that has basic addition subtraction that is not boring."
5,Great game for the little ones,My 6 year old mastered the Math Missions 3-5 so I got this K-2 game for his 4 year old sister. Both kids love this game. Sometimes I have to pry them off the computer! A very good choice for your 4-7 year old!
4,A good game for math practice,Bought this for our kindergartener who needed some practice with numbers. It has been fun for her to play and doesn't feel like homework. The activities seem well suited to differing levels of skill. Overall a good way to practice math skills.
4,Pretty good,"My six year old enjoys playing it, and it does seem to teach him a few things. The price was good."
5,Great Investment,"All three of my children loved this CD. It is fun, challenging and clever. I used it over the summer to keep math skills sharp. The 6 year old needed little help to navigate. My five year old plays along with his sister's help. No frustrating glitches for my PC laptop that usually drive a parent crazy. Worth having in the learning library."
4,Curious to find out?,I was curious to find out just what Iva recorded on her camera and how it might affect those around her as well as her. This is an English film which shows a dysfunctional family struggling to stay together despite what is whirling around them. The producer shows us a daughter with high expectations of the world with a mother and father who are not the best. A very thought provoking film.
5,Good English Food,The Margaret Rudkin cook book isn't just a cook book. It includes a biographical sketch of our family history in County Carlow Ireland.I give a copy to all of our children on their wedding day to keep the memories alive.Chuck RudkinInventoryAuditor.com
5,This book is an excellent Javascript resource.,"I found this to be a useful book for my web-site development. The material is comprehensive, the examples are good, and the information I was looking for was easy to find.The coverage is thorough and professionally written."
4,good blu-ray,"'An American in Paris' has probably been reviewed thousand of times since its release, and its fans can tell you their favorite parts - mine are, oddly enough, any scene with Oscar Levant - especially 'Concerto in F'. This blu-ray version has some pluses, the first being how visually clear it is and how vibrant the colors are. It is definitely an up-grade from any standard DVD I have seen. Another plus are the featurettes, one on Gene Kelly which is well done and another on the making of this particular film. Both are very interesting. The only disappointment is the 1:33:1 format - or a standard format. This is a film which should have been done in widescreen - especially the dance sequence at the end. We are so spoiled by all the new productions of musicals in widescreen that it is too bad that this one was done before its time. However, lovers of Gene Kelly and musicals will most likely enjoy having this version in their collection."
5,Movie,Perfect for the value...A classic I wanted to use pedagogically...Good movie with nice scenery and good music...Soundtrack by Gershwin!!!
2,No sound during movie,The sound did not work while playing the movie. Everything else was just fine. None of our other DVDs have this problem
3,Paris Romance,"The panoramic sweeps over Paris are more than you can expect to see in most movies about Paris. We find an artist (Gene Kelly) struggling to make a living and borrowing money from his friends. He ends up having to chose between two women. The one he loves and the one who can support his hobbies.If you can get past the first few scenes of corny comic exuberance, there are moments of romance worth waiting for. The ballet is spectacular and is in such contrast with the opening scenes, you wonder if you are watching the same movie.Now I understand this famous line:With a binding like you've got, people are going to want to know what's in the book. ~Alan Jay Lerner, An American in Paris (screenplay)I had to laugh at the ballerina at the start trying to read a book and dance.Probably the most exuberant musical I've seen yet. A bit much for anyone who is even slightly jaded, but if you are even slightly old fashioned and a romantic, you will probably love this movie.~The Rebecca Review"
5,A Timeless Classic,A musical and visual treat starring the incomparable Gene Kelly supported by an outstanding cast.
4,great movie,gift old movies that have great music and you can sing along too -special because its Gene Kelly dancing have it in my collect too
4,Yummy!,"Gene Kelly in ""An American in Paris"" makes dancing look like flying and is comes across as effortlessly charming and just beautiful to look at. The role itself would have been perfect for a man 15 years his junior, but even though he was 39 when it was made, Kelly for the most part, looks to be in his mid to late 30's. created magic with his choreography and the beauty of his dance. Vincent Minelli's pacing is brilliant and the acting superb. However, one of the reels that this was copied from must have been off because about halfway through the film the colors become yellowed and muted to a degree that is distracting."
2,Just Another Musical,"I found this film to be average. I find most musicals (especially MGM productions) to be tedious, so that probably contributes to my lack of enthusiasm for it. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Gershwin's great music. For fun with friends, or by yourself, wait for the ""An American in Paris"" ballet at the end of the film. When the section comes on, where Gene Kelly is dressed in an off-white outfit, and wearing a Ty Cobb style baseball hat, watch with the sound off."
5,One of the most enjoyable musicals I have seen.,"I was never a huge musical fan, but this movie changed my mind. It has everything- light heartedness, sadness, a sweet and simple love story. I found the ballet a little overwhelming, but interesting both as a dance, and as an imaginative use of French painters' work. Each section of the ballet is in the style of a different painter: Dufy, Renoir, Lautrec, Van Gogh, etc., choreographed by Kelly, who does an incredible job. The movie has something that makes you able to watch it again and again--if only for the exuberance of I Got Rhythm and 'SWonderful."
5,GENE KELLY AT HIS BEST - WONDERFUL MUSICAL,"This film has eveything going for it: great Gerswhin music, great visuals, the beauty of Paris (despite being filmed on a backlot), a fine script, the lovely Leslie Caron, the humorous Oscar Levant, the amazing talent of Gene Kelly, a still-breathtaking 17 minute ballet, choreographed by Kelly, at the film's climax, and ROMANCE! This is one of my favorite musicals of all-time!"
3,Same Old DVD,It's the same content as the DVD but it does make the film look better. Its deserves a first rate production to go with it's best picture of the year status. Sound and picture quality are great. Turn up the sound and enjoy the music.
4,"For fans of Gershwin , Kelly and Levant",Rather a silly story but heh this is a musical ballet and dance piece. Kelly is at his best with the music of George Gershwin's American in Paris and more. One highlight is Gershwin's friend and piano virtuoso Oscar Levant play GG's piano concerto. The film won 6 academy awards including best picture. It's in color but in 4:3 format. Quality is quite good overall given the film's vintage. Very much enjoyed seeing this again in the BluRay format.
3,Great George Gershwin - so so Kelly,"Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) ex-GI stays in Paris to practice painting. There he is patronized by a jealous Milo Roberts (Nina Foch). Mean time he is trying to make time with a store clerk that is more than she appears to be (Leslie Caron).Not one of Kelly's best but passable. However even at his best one has to have a taste for that sort of thing. He is sort of a Danny Kay type. His high-water pants are his signature and really looks out of place. He cannot sing worth beans. However he did do a good job in ""What a Way to Go.""Even though this film is not a notable movie it was directed by Vincente Minnelli (1903-1986.) He directed some great movies and some that you would never suspect such as ""The Long Long Trailer.""What a Way to Go! - Actors: Shirley MacLaine, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Dean Martin, Gene Kelly"
5,Yesteryear,American in Paris & Singing in the Rain are stories from a time long that no longer exists . . . with sweet music & excellent dance. They are an excellent education for the young & an escape for adults trapped in 60 hour work weeks.
4,Great movie/musical on flawed DVD.,"Great movie for fans of George Gershwin, Oscar Levant, Gene Kelly. Also Noell Neill, who was TV's Lois Lane (Superman's girl), appears in one scene. But the DVD is flawed. First, it's not wide screen. Second, purple blotches appear from time to time in the upper right and other scenes have visible video noise. Third, the only place I could find the complete cast list was on Amazon.com. This is a MGM movie owned by Ted Turner. I wish Ted had spent some of his movie colorization budget on improving the colors in this one. I own over 500 DVDs and many of them are perfect, some unwatchable, and most like An American in Paris: There are scenes that are gorgeous and others that are faded and noisy. But I did love it!!"
3,Good musical: below average transfer,"Overall, this film is very entertaining, although the dance number at the end started to become a little long. The transfer to DVD left a little to be desired in my opinion. The color wasn't very good in a couple of places, and I noticed a few frames with red blotches.""An American in Paris"" is good, but if you want Gene Kelley at his best, get ""Singin' in the Rain."""
4,"TWO DISK SET IN THE OFFING, WB?","This is an acceptable, but not exceptional, master of AAIP, but where is the double disk set deluxe treatment for this special film? Maybe Warners is readying a double disk of Gigi as well as one of An American in Paris? They're long overdue. And WB could package them with the existing Meet Me in St. Louis 2 disk set, or maybe spruce them all up for Blue-Ray. In the meantime, this is an imperishable valentine to the romantic, postwar American dream of Paris, decked out with high art homages, a perfect cast and an entertaining, sexually ambivalent subtext for those who care. Viva Minnelli!"
1,Not what I expected,"Sorry. I agree with this movie's detractors (for the most part.)I'm a fan of musicals, but this one bored me to tears.1 minute of plot, 113 minutes of dancing...and dancing...and dancing."
1,The Worst Cinematic Experience,"I cannot begin to describe how much I despise and loathe this film. I am convinced that watching this film has taken years off my life. I have lost sleep contemplating the depths of this film's poor quality. I would think that the extremely talented Gene Kelly would not have even wanted to be associated with the same studio that produced this film, let alone star in it. What astounds me even more is that those who have seen it do not scorn this film, instead they actually praise it and have the audacity to call it a classic and a masterpiece. I am truly appalled by anyone who likes this film. It's not even that I do not care for musicals, Singin' in the Rain is my favorite film of any genre. If you have not seen this film, or only have vague recollections of the ballet sequence, it is not to late to save yourself from the worst cinematic experience one could have."
1,A viewer in Hell,"I am a great fan of Gene Kelly, however this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have painfully sat through Earnest Goes to Camp. The script is horrendous, and Gene Kelly's character is repulsive, chauvinistic, and blatantly impertinent . In the movie he tells Leslie Caron's character ""With a binding like yours people are going to want to know what's in the cover."" The famous ballet sequence is remarkable but it is too little too late to save this pointless and obnoxious movie."
5,Honest work,This album really resonated with me especially the lyrics when coupled with the Alaskan mountains in the background. He should team up with all rental car compnaies in the area and distribute his Cd so tourists who check out the Kenai listened to his music at the same time...it would be sound marketing. In particular his line too much is just enough seemed to be appropriate having experienced the vast geographic immensities. His intent seemed to be honest and his holisitic philosophies on health rounded out the overall impact making it a good ---sublime--folksy album to drive to.
3,Arrived in poor shape,Nice color and sturdy handle.... mine came with the bristles permanently bent over and so I never liked it. My son used it on a griddle that was too warm and the bristles melted and it was ruined.
1,not a good intro to future lounge at all!,"Night over Manaus was the only track I liked on this cd! It's not worth it. Please, if you want a good lounge cd, check out OM Lounge - their serious is extremely well put together. This was awful. The tracks were borderline too weird and just way too repetative and annoying. Hardly what one would call future lounge. This one is just not worth it."
5,It works without complaints,"I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment."
5,Simply the best,"It is simply the best money can buy,especially if your hair is coarse.The heat this thing kicks out is great for straightening hair.Fantastic!!"
5,Turbo Power 1500 Prof. Hair Dryer,Love this!! I purchased before from a store and lasted for a long period of time. I would recommend this to everybody!
2,Takes forever to dry my hair,I would return this but it's been too long. I almost immediately went back to my old dryer after a couple of times. I have since found another dryer on Amazon that I just received and it's doing a wonderful job.
5,luv it!!!! best dryer ever,"It let my hair so nice and without freeze!!!!! im so sad that i drop mine by mistake after 3 years that i have it with me, but ill defenetly buy it again!!!"
2,much better pro dryers out there and for cheaper,"I did research before purchasing and I am very disappointed. Wish I had saved the packaging so I can return. Not hot enough for my fine hair that needs a decent amount of heat to hold any kind of style. My last Revlon dryer that I spend less than $30 on was better than this. After about 6 years it stopped working. I decided to invest in a professional dryer because friends had raved what a difference it makes and that it's worth the investment. I believe them, this is just not the dryer that backs up that statement."
1,What a disappointment.,I am So glad that I just got this book from the library and didn't spend any money on it.If this is what horror has come to then I guess that I will have to read older stuff.This is definitely not in line with The Dark Descent which is my favorite anthology of all time.These stories just kind of sicken me.They are mostly about mans cruelty to other man(or women).I don't like stories like these at all.I find them very depressing and upsetting.If I want to read about things like the above I would read more nonfiction.This is not my idea of entertainment.It made me want to take a shower after reading just a couple of the stories.There is also very little supernatural elements in the stories which I think makes stories fun.All around a very unpleasant anthology.
1,A sad summary of the state of horror,"This book is one of the most poorly written and shoddily compiled collections I've ever read. Additionally, it is a sad commentary on the field of horror today. Barker is fast becoming a parody of himself: his bookending ""stories"" in Revelations, if you can call these underplotted and overpretentious works ""stories,"" are foolish and dumb, as is every story here with the exception of Richard Christian Matheson's story, which stands out like a jewel in a pile of garbage. In general, these stories are unconnected except in vague ways, are poorly written (even Joe Lansdale's story is pretty crappy, which quite surprised me), and are self-important to the point of hilarity. For true horror, read Thomas Ligotti or Kim Newman. For contemporary dreck that almost makes Ann Rice look decent (quite an achievement, believe me), try this weighty book of self-important nonsense."
1,Yikes that was bad,"Words fail me, which is not usual at all. All I can say is if they decide to do another one of these things for God's sake pick an editor that knows what he's doing!"
3,it's not anything special,"it's just a typical comb. nothing too ""ergonomic"" about it. it wasn't particularly good or particularly bad. it's just like what you'd expect from a cat comb. i wouldn't recommend it if you can find something cheaper in a local pet store."
1,Never finished it,"Pat Conroy writes the same thing over and over again. I did not finish this because it is so much like his others. Maybe, if I become desperate some day, I will pick it up again."
5,Excellent read!,"E.D. Robinon, NYPat Conroy does not disappoiint in this work. His use of language is so acurate that he transports the reader to the stately homes of Charleston, the barracks of the Institute and the brutal rituals of the plebe year and beyond. The characters are well developed and leads one to wonder whether some of the experiences are autobiographical.The novel is set in South Carolina during the era of Viet Nam. The lead character,Will McLean has enrolled in the military Institute and along his journey towards graduation there are many twists and turns that keeps the reader riveted. The strong bonds of love and friedship between Will and his room mates provides an emotional depth that balances the cruelty and violence that is played out. There is loyalty, betrayal and unrequited love that ultimately transforms Will into a Whole Man.This is a fantastic novel and a page turner. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Love it,"I love all of Pat Conroy's books. He is an extraordinary writer. As a woman, I did not expect to like a book about a military school. However, Conroy's writing is so good, I couldn't help but love it."
5,Loved It!,"Outstanding story of four boys becoming men at the Carolina Military Institute in Charleston. Based on Conroy's experiences at The Citidal. Loved the story, characters and setting. Never knew who to trust, what would happen next and how the story would end...and the ending blew me away. The book is a study in contrasts...good vs bad, boy vs man, have vs have not, black vs white, goal striving vs achievement, etc. And everywhere there is Charleston...and the expectations and influences of society South of Broad. This is the second Conroy book I've enjoyed and two remain on my must read list (The Great Santini and Prince of Tides)."
5,Great Book,"I'm attending the Citadel this fall and was told to read this book before I went. I immediately went out and bought it. After two days I had finished it. Having been to Charleston numerous times, I found the description beautifully written in the book. This book is a must read and can't be put down. Pat Conroy is a great author."
4,Nice read,"Loved it !Could not put this book down. I was anxious to know what the next surprise would be. How things turned out. I felt many different emotions of anger, fear, happiness, and justice throughout the book"
3,Cruel & graphic,Excellantly written. Subject matter and content often offensive. I would not recommend it for young readers. I have enjoyed his other books better.
2,The Lords of Discipline,"The book came promptly, but it was so old that the pageswere turning yellow. I didn't like that, but it seemedthe product was new."
1,The Lords of Discipline,Worst trashy sordid book I have ever attempted to read. Can not believe this was written by Pat Conroy. Certainly not up to his usual literary skills. I have to pitch this one.
4,A Powerful Novel,"Pat Conroy's The Lords of Disciple is a wonderful novel which captures the struggles of military school with brilliant detail seen through the eyes of Will McLean. It is a story of life's struggles which Will must overcome while finding his true self. Pat Conroy was not afraid at al to dig deep into tough issues such as rascism and hazing, coming down hard on the military system. He has a writing style which grips the reader at unexpected times, making it hard to walk away from this powerful novel. I recommend this book for those who have any spark of interest in what goes on behind a military intitute's walls or simply want a captivating, fast paced read that expresses love, honor, betreyal, and confidence."
5,Some writers just had a way with words,"When I was applying to the University of Chicago in the winter of 1998, one of the questions they asked was (approximately) for me to describe a few of my favorite books, movies, music, or other works and why they interested me. This book and this author was the first and only one that came to mind. I think it is because of the way he treats his writing. It is not all about plots or characters, but about the way he uses his language. Some of his passages are among the most beautiful that I have ever read. This is not to say he neglects the other elements of writing. The plot is exciting, and his human insights are keen. Especially intriguing is the main character of Will Mclean, who I identify with, perhaps because I feel like I too am going through a time of change in my life. This book is well worth both your money and your time."
5,Simply brilliant,"Having just finished this book, I find it fitting to report to you all that I started to read this novel on ANZAC Day, April 25, the day we Aussies commemorate our wartime heroes, both past and present. For Conroy's beautifully written novel, revolving around life in the 1960's world of an American military college, epitomises all that we have come to realise that the ANZAC's stood for - courage, steadfastness, loyalty, and, of course, that great Aussie word and ethos, ""mateship"".The first Conroy I have read - but certainly won't be the last."
5,Reality smacks you in the face in this Conroy novel.,"As an avid reader of Pat Conroy, this is probably my most favorite of his works. I grew up in awe of The Citadel, and the men it produced. I have never laughed, cried, and lived so vicariously through a book, as I have with this title."
5,One of the greatest books I've ever read,"I've read this book perhaps 5 times. It is one of the greatest books I've ever read and is definitely in my top 5 best reads list. I won't tell you the plot as other reviewers have, but I would like to quote the first line of the book ""I want you to understand why I hate the school with all my power and passion. Then I want you to forgive me for loving the school. You see, I wear the ring."" I am currently a 3rd classmen at a federal academy, and this book is very real. Although a bit more brutal than I remember things being...I wouldn't be suprised if it was entirely true for the time period it was written for. You must read, you won't regret it."
4,a great military tale,"I have to admit my fondness for all military tales -- I loved Dress Gray, and almost every book I've ever read about military discipline. This one though is one of my all time favorites in that genre. It's brutal at times, but a major page turner. Great plane or beach reading -- just make sure no one interrupts you until you're done. As an aside, because of the vivid pacing and compelling plot, this is a great book to give to kids (especially boys) who are reluctant readers. All students I've recommended this book to have loved it."
3,The Lords of Discipline,"I have always enjoyed Conroy, however this one was even wordier than the rest. The harshness of the militarywas interesting and appalling."
5,An exhausting but suspenseful read.,"I really enjoyed reading this novel and the author has a great command of the English language. At times the surprisedetails were a little too far fetched, but the novel certainly keeps the reader right on the edge of his chair during theentire reading."
5,The most excellent book I have ever read!,"This book will make you laugh, cry, and cheer the characters on in their quest at the Carolina military Institute. Anyone who reads this book will not be disappointed!"
3,slow developing,Enjoyed it but easy to put it down and come back to it later. Ending was predictable with no surprises.
2,Too Wordy,The Lords of Discipline was too wordy. The content was harsh and I found the whole book unbelievable. Just didn't like it.
3,"Generally excellent, but charcters not consistent","I agree with about 90% of the reviewers: Very interesting, at times gripping story; vivid descriptive content about the school and the city; wonderfully crafted conflict. However, two aspects bothered me:1) The characterizations of Pignetti and Santoro seemed forced and sketchy and too inconsistent -- especially in regard to their relationship with each other and with the other two roommates. (Conroy, in my opinion, is more on target with southerners.)SPOILER BELOW2) The ending: To me, a forced, contrived, manipulative cop-out. Tradd the father of the baby of the beautiful Annie Kate? Not the way he was portrayed -- not in a million years. And Tradd's sudden change of tone and personality during his talk with Will and his mother? Again, presposterously inconsistent. (It appears to me as if the author just wanted to wrap up the story. And in doing so, caused a destruction of both character and plot.)"
5,Beautifully Written,A long sweeping story that draws the reader into the life of the military student. An eye-opening account of all that goes on during the freshman year. How friendships and strong bonds are made with emotions for a place that make boys men. Pat Conroy can paint a beautiful picture for the reader.
3,Pretty good.,"Pretty good story, fairly well written. Not his best work, but not his best. Go ahead if you're a Conroy fan."
4,A Great Read,I'm a huge fan of Pat Conroy and have read many of his books. The Lords of Discipline was way up there as far as holding my interest.
4,Very good read,"Lords of Discipline was a very good read. It kept you interested from beginning to end. The mystique of both the military college and the city of Charleston were well established. Not sure how close to reality some of the hazing incidents really were, but I took them with a grain of salt.I had a few friends who went to the Citadel and was happy to have some insight as their experience there. The generally experience of military life, the camaraderie, and the idea of being a ""Whole Man"" were items they could easily confirm."
4,The Lords of Discipline,I love southern writers and Pat Conroy is one of my favorites. This was written in 1980 but I hadn't read it until now. It tells the story of a young man at a military academy in South Carolina in the late '60s - very interesting. Made me wonder if they still operate the same way - sounded like hell to me! Mr. Conroy tells a great story and draws on his own experience at The Citadel.
5,A beautifully written book,"If there is a more elloquent writer out there, someone please point him out to me. The book is beautifully written, with a well a constructed plot, and and deep character development. I found myself constantly envious of Pat Conroy's talent as I moved through the pages. You will find yourself quickly connected to the lead character, and from that point on this book is a page turner. I would call this work a ""must-read"" and give it the highest possible review."
5,A great read for people who love beautiful and evocative writing,"Very beautifully written. An amazing novel about brotherhood, loyalty, and duty. Does a wonderful job at delving into the life of a cadet at a military college or academy. I would recommend this novel to anyone who plans to attend or has attended a military college/academy."
5,you'll enjoy this book,"I am a man of little words and seldom write reveiws; but, that said, I really enjoyed this book. It could be because I grew up in this time period or that I can relate basic training to what the cadets go through; but I think it was because it is just well written and a good story. You'll enjoy it...I promise."
5,Passionate poetry in prose format!,Conroy captures the essence of what becoming a man is by illustrating what it isn't. Why any right-thinking person would want to attend the Citadel or Virginia Military Institute after reading this book is beyond me.Conroy's style is hynotically poetic. His readers hunger for just one more chapter at the end of each one.This is a terrific book that should be on the reading list of every American high school!Kudos to Conroy!
4,Lords of Discipline,"I must confess that I am a Pat Conroy junkie; I read everything he writes. Few authors have the command of language and majesty that he has. That being said, this is a moving story, but not the best he has written. He sometimes goes over the top in trying to create humor or to shock the reader. This was clearly a story based on his own experience. It is one of his earlier efforts; he has gotten better over time."
1,Dated Beginners Guide,"Disappointed is about the only word that comes to mind. The book is written for complete novices (trust me, you know more than you might realize, which will be painfully obvious once you open this book.). Aside from the lengthy overview of the basics, you get hand drawn images of imaginary people doing really basic moves. Yay. And the whole ""set up your own routine"" is clunky and rather limited given the scope of exercises provided. Do yourself a favor and avoid this title. Instead, pick up The Abs Diet Get Fit Stay Fit Plan, which is much more complete, modern, and useful."
5,For once I don't feel lost reading a weight training book,"I like to research any new endevor, before I commit to a course of action. As a beginning weight ""trainee"", out of all of the books I've read about this subject, this was the most clear, concise and comprehensive. It gave me all of the information I needed to not only tailor my own program, but where and how to begin, (i.e. how to calculate a good starting workout load, how many reps, etc...) The book takes you through the basics, but is flexible enough to fit anybody's particular preferences and resources. While a few more exercises would be helpful, there are plenty of them layed out to get a good program started."
1,There is a Better Book,"This is a very academic-like book. For example, it gives formulas for calculating how much weight you should use. While I like the way it uses science, I think you'll be better off gettingStarting Strength (2nd edition)instead."
4,"One of his earlier books-very good, but he does better.","His book is technically very good. Horse lovers easily recognise that he knows his subject well. As always, he has a good plot that is not easy to predict. His later books show how much better he has become, but it was a very good book."
1,Don't trust the sizes,"Received this cap and it's designed for a pin-headed dwarf. ""Large"" wouldn't fit on a Barbie-doll let alone an adult. Be warned."
1,b &w of a color film,the movie is high lonesome it was in the details as a b&w film but i didn't see that. now if i send it back it will cost me so i am stuck with this copy.too much trouble to send back i have not seen this sort of thing since the days of vhs tape it was common pratice then but now it's wierd.i did get the color version put out by by vci and it is excellent.so be careful and look at the product details.i would not want you to be had.
3,Murder of Cormyr,Great for the pre-teen reader. A lot too predictable. Spoon feeding of clues and plot. Read it if you have nothing better to do.
2,I did not like this. They only gave me Durex condoms. I wanted some Trojan afterall they are considered most reliable.,I did not like this they only gave me Durex condoms. I wanted some Trojan this is false advertisement. If it says variety why didnt I get variety.
4,"Good variety, excellent!","The expiration is 3 years from now, the variety is good, brands I would have never tried otherwise, and I would definitely recommend this one!"
2,More for Technicians than Engineers,I suppose most automotive engineers will have to purchase a copy of this handbook. But: it's not that good. It reads more like a legal treatise than an engineering book. It's mostly text and schematics with relatively few equations. The book is not mathematically detailed enough to write simulation or optimization computer programs. Therefore it's more appropriate for technicians.
3,Excellent Overview for Gearheads,"This book is an excellent overview of all aspects of vehicle design theory, basic principles, and reference information. It is NOT a guide to auto repair and is NOT for someone who is only interested in fixing and/or improving auto performance. The best description is to say it is the one single most useful book a newly graduated engineer should have and read upon entering the field of vehicle engineering and engine design. This is not to say it is beyond non-engineers, but only to say that if you are not interested in the theory and principles of automotive design and operation, this book is not for you."
4,"Definitely, but it!","Being an automotive engineer, I bought this book thinking that it will be an easy reference book for small definitions that I have forgotten. Turns out that this is an automotive engineer's bible! Everyone in my company has this book and this is really good. This book has small details about everything in the automobile, starting from definitions in basic physics to dimensions to SAE standards. This is a super quick guide to have a ""sanity check"" to know if you are going the right way. I have definitely learned a lot from this.If you are looking for something very specific, this is definitely not what you want. I just love this book and will definitely suggest anyone to buy this one, its well worth the money!"
4,Helpful way for the computer oriented to understand how a vehicle works.,It is helpful to understand a vehicle service advisor when they are inspecting your car. This book allows me to know how to assess risk when service work is being recommended. It also supports meaningful dialogue when describing symptoms being displayed by my vehicle.
5,The Reference,"This book is the most extensive collection of facts, I have ever seen. I have used this book in my years of enginering school, and it has everything from material descriptions, to ""find your own"" drag-coefficient calculations. Simply the best."
3,Many subjects without much detail.,"One of my interests when I bought this book was about SAE oil viscosity. There is a subject about this, but I expected for a graphic showing viscosity vs temperature with many oils and more technical details not just concepts and explanation about used terms. I expected something like ESDU papers."
5,Wonderful!,This series is amazing. What a great way to get a sense of the time period. I had a hard time putting this book down.
3,nice product,"the straps aren't very good for a small tv, i used four straps for my son's room for his TV, When i pulled the tv towards me the back straps came off!! the awesome thing about the straps is that they're great for keeping cabniets closed!! since i have cabneit doors without knobs these straps work awesome!!"
4,Earthquake straps,These straps work great and I would have given them 5 stars except for the price. I feel it is way too much for this item. All that said this was the cheapest place for these straps.
4,Very Strong!,We use this product to secure a very front heavy and low placed TV. I followed the easy directions and it seems to be holding up wonderfully. I will give it 5 stars when I find out what it does to the furniture after we don't need it anymore.
5,Settlers of Canaan,Settlers is a fun game for kids and adults. Makes for great family time. Easy to learn.
3,Settlers of Canaan Game,"This game is so complicated - I gave it as a gift and they have not figured it out yet. I was over one night and we tried, but to no avail. Maybe if you have time to sit down alone and study it, you could then teach it to others."
2,Religious version of Settlers of Catan,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. I didn't realize it was a religious version of the game I wanted. I had to send it back.
4,"Leo did not play Marvin, he played Hank ( reader at the top)","This movie/book was funny in most parts and ""whatever"" in other parts but it was really good!"
3,Pricey!,"This video is sort of short and not as detailed as I had hoped for the price I paid. You might learn better from a friend and the manual itself. This video is not produced by Garmin, it was a little helpful in getting started. Most things will have to be learned by trial and error."
1,Don't Worry-,"There was never any album, CD or Project released by William called ""Ambient"". This was an error on the part of Amazon.Com - this project never existed."
5,looks good and tastes good.,When I pored it into the pan I noticed all the fire roast marks on the corn. I thought that was kind of interesting. This soup has Alot of flavor and good sized potato chunks. It is organic with no bad additives so I give it 5 stars.
3,Great Product/Price if you dont mind all of the cans being Dented,"Ive enjoyed this product for some time now and decided to get it a bit cheaper from Amazon than from my grocery here in NY. Apparently they offer the cheaper price since all of the cans are dented, which is not from shipping. Cans in the middle are also dented. Every last one. Would be 4-5 stars if not for this. Ive read articles relating to health risks posed by dented cans, even if not fully punctured."
2,Terrible cover and leaky drain plugs,"Table is great if you want to play with it for a few minutes with water and then don't care if all the water leaks out. Also, ""showercap"" style cover blows off easily and doesn't keep rain out. This table is perfect if you want to empty and refill sand and water with each use."
5,Why just outdoors?,I think the complaints about the cover come from customers who have the table solely outdoors...I have mine in the playroom with a table cloth underneath (just incase). It requires very little sand and water and I have had no problems with it yet!
5,my nephew loves this toy!! gets lots of use !,This is a great item. Little ones can feel involved when adults are using their flashlights!!!
3,"Many, many typos in Kindle edition","The publisher didn't spend much money converting this fine novel to Kindle format. If I had a penny for every ""arc"" for ""are"", the book would be free. I also like ""rioting"" for ""noting"". Bad OCR with no proofreading at its finest. I'll think twice before buying any other Hachette books."
4,The Hope & The Glory,"I love both The Hope and The Glory for giving a wonderfully readable history of Israel, but I think that Wouk may hold to the polygamist viewpoint. He never mentions a happy fulfilling relationship between 2 who are actually married. All of the married men and some of the married women had long-standing, continuing affairs. It got very tedious to slog through. Call it what you want, but I do not see the difference between having a wife and a mistress for 25 years or just having 2 wives."
5,Both books are great!,"I first read The Hope when it came out years ago, and waited for The Glory to be released. I was not disappointed! This is a great book, one you will not be able to put down. It tells the history of Israel against the backdrop of real life. (love, hate, marriage, birth, death). I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about the Middle East and the history."
1,plot and characters are neither believeable nor plausible,"As one who loves to read about Israel's heroic triumphs over the Arabs, I bought this book and drooled all the way home, just couldn't wait to devour it. The first few chapters were actually intriguing, very down-to-earth, and even funny -- if you're familiar with Israel's annoying bueaurcracy, the part about the tourist's troubles in getting his brand-new Porsche into the country should be amusing. Unfortunately, the plot eventually gets too close to being a cheap soap opera. I never actually finished the book because I simply could not stand the love affairs, the melodramaticism of the characters, the fact that they were all famous and good looking and important -- it was all too damn Hollywood. I was truly disappointed. What I thought would be an intriguing historical fiction novel turned into a mush of a romance. pulp fiction."
1,waste of money,"The clear plexiglass window detracts from the ability to use the touch screen display of the zune hd. If you try to remove the plexiglass so that you can use the touch screen, the case will get bent out of shape. It's a horrible design and not worth buying."
3,Good Card,"This is the first time I set up a wireless desktop in my home. I had a lot of trouble configuring it until I set it to DHCP. Not a failure on the product, just user error. Works great and as advertised. Signal reception is not as strong as I expected but no drops have been experienced. I am using with LinkSys Wireless Access Point."
3,Over adveristised,"My opinion is just regular wireless card, nothing fancy, no better transfer 54 mbit max and the range is not extraordinary."
5,A death metal marvel..,"Absolutely great,between the 10 best death metal lps ever.Everything from the first till the last song is perfect.Music so powerfull,and full of feeling not hundreds of bands ever managed to reach to a level like that.Guitars and vocals taken from nightmares.Haunting atmosphere,a true masterpiece.Only for those who can appreciate.."
5,reality,"This was one of the best documentary that I've ever seen, it was truthful and honest and real life, and I've spent the last 4yrs trying to find it. I actually record I was recording this and fell asleep and my tape ran out so I have half the movie or most of it as it was nearing the end I ran out of tape. this is a must see for america an especially young teen, old teen everybody."
4,only missing two things...,I would have given this 5 stars but.... It has no way to breed the Monsters together like you could in the first two games.I love the new faster battles you seem to have much more control and the Graphics are almost perfect almost like you are watching a cartoon. (about fighting monsters) the only other thing I missed was not being able to bring monsters you had raised from the first two games over since the ps2 games can't access the ps1 card. I do like this very much though.
2,"It's cute, but...","This game is pretty cute. It's graphics are a little lame compared to what they are supposed to be being it is a PS2 game, but I guess that's what they do to you when your only so young. One main problem I had with this game is that it is incredibly boring. Every 5 minutes or so it supposedly a ""new"" day, and every day you train your monster. Every month you feed it, and every season you go venturing. It's really practically the same thing ever 20 min or so, and the only differences is when you battle and when you move on to a new training land. Really, I don't think that you should get it unless your child is really easily amused."
5,"Great for your kids, great for your parents","First thing I have to say, I thought this game was pretty lame when my 6 year old bought it. However, when I sat down with it, I got up three hours later and had to admit that it was a great game.I've heard some people say that the graphics are [bad]. When 300 different monsters, with 5 or six different subspecies have to animated with cel shading, i tend to sympathize with the developers. Also, the music can be grating, but it sets the mood of the particular world nicely and let's face it folks, this is a game based on an anime tv show. The gameplay, though simple, is severly addicting and gives you more and more ways to evolve and train your monster. this game is well made and well played. Chalk one up for Temco!"
5,HEllo I just put this for nothing,LOL. I don't even have the game. I'm going to get it though. Buhbye
1,Sorry for the interruption,"FINAL FANTASY X IS WAY BETTER! if are looking for a true and pure RPG, look at the reviews for FFX. Or better yet, buy it!"
1,this game suckkkss!!!!!!!,"I BUY THIS GAME AND IT,S SOO STUPID ROLL PLAYING IT,S THA MOST AMAZING STUPID GAME EVER SINCE ATARI COME TO LIVE....I RECOMEND YOU TO NOY WEIST YOUR MONEY ON THAT THING!!!!"
3,Almost as good as I remembered...,"My dad had this album years ago, I mean back in the 70's. He has always been a fan of David T. Walker. Before Amazon, we could never find anything on David T. Well, I ordered this CD for him for Christmas and there are some tracks on it that are not on the original album. My dad was ok with it because he got to hear some new stuff, but I was a little dissappointed because I was expecting it to be the old stuff. We still enjoy it but the CD cover is misleading.Thanks."
4,"""On Love"" Still fresh and very soulful...","I have this music on LP, but had to purchase the CD.David T. Walker knows the feeling and he puts it downon all the tracks here. My friends really like it,because no other artist has David's technique.This album was produced in 1976, but don't let thatward you off, this music and CD copy is up to date."
3,Shipped quickly,We received the item quickly so they are great at shipping out fast. I am not able to comment as to the quality of the set as it was a gift for someone else.
4,NOT too ugly,"America Ferrera (who made people's 100 most beautiful list) is fantastic as Betty. It's a cheesy and fun show. It is just as good as the original novella version my grandma watches. It's not the West Wing or anything, but it's a cute quirky show."
1,Ugly Betty The Complete First Season,The 6-Disc set only had 5 CD in it...CD number 3 was missing when it was opened the firt time...
1,This is why I don't watch television,"I saw a while ago a clip online from some show David Spade has on Comedy Central and he basically hit the nail flat on the head with this show;oh man, you throw some glasses, braces and a quirky wardrobe on a semi-hot actress and all of a sudden she's incredibly ugly, how completely hilarious; yeah, no.""oh, hey, she looks like me, she's awkward, has braces and glasses, awesome what's the name of this fantastic sho...ugly betty? *kills self*""and to quote a great comedian, ""how do you think ugly people feel when someone says ""this is gonna get ugly""? ""well, this doesn't affect me.""alright, that's totally unrelated, but hilarious none the less. unlike this bottom of the barrel, horribly written and utterly overblow, cliche american television; not ALL american TV is a joke, HBO has dished out some classic stuff, but that's HBO, not NBC, the channel that hasn't had anything worth watching in over 6 years."
4,Excellent DVD set,"The quality of this DVD set is excellent, with sharp video and transparent, subtle surround sound audio, in short, production values almost as good as Blu-Ray. As for the show itself, it has its pluses and minuses. The special feature commentary by actors Williams and Urie on Disc 6 is as shallow as the characters they portray. If you like this show, don't hesitate to order this set. It's much better than watching it online."
5,pretty cute ugly betty,"Ugly Betty (American version) is a mixture of all the super fun series -- and movies -- you might have laid your eyes on, such as: Bridget Jones's Diary, The devil wears Prada, Sex and the city, and its original Mexican version.Everything surrounds Betty's not-so-easy job at a fashion magazine office, trying hard to fit in as an orange Japanese fish in shark infested waters...While you watch it, you can travel from the frivolous life of the beautiful and wealthy in Manhattan to the simple, but strong-rooted cultural life of latino immigrants in Queens.Definitely, the BEST series of the moment, if you love comedy."
5,Dont think Just buy!!!!!!!,This is without a doubt one of the if not THE best show ever made. Its certainly the best show i have ever seen. I requested that i could not work thursdays just so i would never miss an episode. Everything about this show is fantastic. Every single character is a joy to watch and there all just so funny. And every episode is simply perfect. There is no such thing as a BAD Ugly Betty episode. So if ur trying to find a new tv show to get into Dont even think about buying another show. U must own Ugly Betty!!!!!!!
5,Ugly Betty-the first season,"I love, love, love Ugly Betty. This first season DVD set is allowing me to catch up on episodes I missed. I love the behind-the-scenes dvd, too. I'm proud of my homegirl-Ana Ortiz(who plays Betty's sister)and I love the Wilhomena character played by Vanessa Williams."
5,"""MARC!!!!!!""","If you've watched this show you know what the title means. I LOVE this show. The casting was perfect and acting top-notch. It is a bit campy, but sooooo enjoyable. You'll laugh and cry and sometimes at the same time. I can't say enough about this show. My favorite character is MARC!!!!!! He's a jewel. Highly recommend."
3,Forever an ugly duckling.,"Ugly Betty - The Complete First Season had a killer, sweet pilot episode but after that, I lost interest in this critcs darling comedy. America Ferrera is 100% Betty, her character is intelligent, sensitive, and anything but a fool. The first five episodes were really strong but the show got hokey and the jokes grew to be lame. I watched a couple of episdoes from season 3, the show has only gotten worse - what happened to Betty's hair? Looks like Ugly Betty will never transform into a beautiful swan."
5,Very entertaining!,The situations Betty gets into are very funny. I will enjoy watching Betty for many years to come.
1,be forewarned,"For those with impressionable children, or those who are impressionable children themselves, think twice before reading this one. At the age of about eight or nine I'd read tons of Poe and Lovecraft and escaped unscathed, but this book gave me night terrors and nightmares for months. If you're looking for something spooky with a cinched-up ending that will let you sleep tight, you should probably look somewhere else!"
4,Scared to Death,"Johnna Malcolm rights this book with a great idea in her head. It is great how she make each of the Bullocks-Elliot, Quentin, and Muffle. The plot is great and it will keep you guessing. It is a great combination of horror and suspence. Something new will happen on each page."
4,Just fine.,"Decent cables at a decent price. No complaints here. Not sure what else to say. Only annoyance was that I ordered 3, and they arrived in 2 separate shipments."
1,the last threws of the 90's cro-mags more than dissapointing,"this cd is a flat liner to be,the only good song are war on the streets and a remix of the other side of maddnes. a single of these song would have been satifactory.the cro-mags were not even able to record together and mix it at this time they really were tearing themselves apart and cancelling shows long before these cd due to band turmoil and in fighting.I wouldn't waste my money but if you own it who will buy it?sad"
1,Near Death??? This one put the nails in the coffin..,"As a true Cro-Mags fan I had to purchase this album. But let me tell you, I know that during the time this came out the band was not talking to eachother and pretty much said it was through. What I did not realize is that whomever mixed/produced/engineered this CD must have hated them too. There is some good music but it is so badly mixed that it pretty much kills it. Even though the Cro-Mags have had their personal differences with eachother, I am glad that they put them aside to put out 'Revenge'. Also, re-releasing classic tracks on 'Before the Quarrel' which is a great CD for any Cro-Mags fan. Check out Harley's new band 'Harley's War'."
4,Unflappable in the Toughest Situations,"Terry Manion gets out of Evangeline Spa after twenty-two days of alcohol and drug rehabilitation. He learns that his old mentor, J.J. Legendre, is dead. Nadia Wells asks Manion to help her investigate the case to see if Legendre was murdered. Nadia is a former madam whose detective agency used to employ both Manion and Legendre.Manion is a bookish guy who is as vulnerable as anybody emerging from alcohol and drug treatment. He is oddly unflappable in the toughest situations. BLUE BAYOU is better than most entries in the field of detective fiction."
5,so cute-I love it,This storage trunk is perfect to hold Madeline's clothes and accessories. My daughter is 5 and she loves it. It makes a great present too!
2,Creating Personalities,"I found that this book had almost too much information in it. It has a very lengthy questionnaire that one could fill out. The book gives some good advice but it can also become tedious. I have to disagree with one reviwer here, who said that if you really need help with creating characters, then you're in big trouble. I have to really disagree with that as all writers need help in one area or another. We all have our strengths and weekness."
3,Useful but limited,"This is a wonderful book for nailing down a charcter's appearance and their basic personality. I loved the thesaraus of noses, eye color, etc. The personality index can really be a motivational tool.However, the facial expression section is at times simply laughable. ""heart wrung with pity"" is simply terrible and ""lump in one's throat"" is older than the hills. Avoid copying anything from this section.Another complaint is the accent section, as the reviewer below pointed out. A writer's book I once read said that accents are to be avoided ""as they are not read so much as translated"". I completely agree with this opinion. ""Oi Loik to avoid accents, mite""All in all, buy this when worrying about very general character creation, it can be a real help"
3,Good but...,"I give this 3 stars because of the Character Questionnaire. It was really helpful and I feel that after answering it, I now know all my characters so much better.However I can not recommend the actual purchase of this book (borrow a friends, buy a used copy or loan from library).Over two-thirds of this book is nothing more than a thesaurus. After I read the first page, I began skipping paragraphs and soon, whole sections. Then I read the Questionnaire and used it for all my characters. This was helpful. But unfortunately, I'm now finished with it. Finding descriptive words, etc. is not an issue for me, so didn't find it particularly helpful.If you want more about the mechanics of Characters, I rec'd Characters & Viewpoints by Orson Scott Card."
5,Building Blocks to Character Idea,"I recently purchased this book, and it's wonderful. The questionaire is amazing, and really helpful to a basic character profile. The book isnt perfect, but it doenst claim to be a thesaurus and if it was it would be a lot bigger. This book gives you the general idea. It cant do the work for you, just help and it does so greatly. Come ready with an idea in mind and a thesaurus to help you along the way. I would recommend to a friend over and over again."
3,lukewarm.,"I bought this album, hoping to hear some new synthesizer noise or tonality. While the textures and timbres present in the album are certainly interesting, the composition and song structures are simplistic and unimaginitive. You kinda feel like he spends the whole first song sound checking his ""ghost sweep"" features on the keyboard. The songs towards the middle are certainly more engaging, but still extremely simple.I was hoping for something a bit more adventurous, I guess."
4,A must read,This is a great book that will encourage you to press into the inner court. I really enjoyed the section on the mercy of God. This will deliver many in the body of Christ from the spirit of condemnation. Pastor Dollar has given the Body of Christ great revelation. We must walk in the teaching.
5,GREAT LOOKING PHOTO ALBUM,"I PURCHASED THIS ALBUM WITH A PARTICULAR USE IN MIND AND AM VERY PLEASED. THE BOOK CONTAINS 20 8X8 INCH BLACK PAGES WHICH LOOKS GREAT WITH BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS. YOU MAY WANT TO PURCHASE THE BLACK PHOTO CORNERS TO MOUNT YOUR PHOTOS AS THERE ARE NO DIVIDERS ON THE PAGES BUT THIS IS GOOD IF YOU HAVE PHOTOS OF DIFFERENT SIZES THAT YOU WANT TO DISPLAY. THE COVER OF THE BOOK DOES HAVE A DIFFERENT DESIGN THAN WHAT IS SHOWN AND THE LEATHER IS A BIT ON THE RED SIDE, BUT TO ME THE COLOR IS FINE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND NICER THAN THE AVERAGE PHOTO ALBUM, THIS WOULD BE IT."
3,Just The Right Shoe Collectors Guide,"This book is a beautiful book as far as the pictures go and it does have all the lines and styles in one book, but the price guide is very limited. It doesn't break down the generation of the shoes, ie: Thailand or China, shoe box colors (a collector's item in themselves), or oddities and their value as most are rare. This publisher should use the similar guidelines of their Beanie Baby Collectors Guide and break down the generations or in this case production generations, and it's varities. As it stands now, it is just a catalog."
4,Helpful,This book had some good information and wish they had more in it. I haven't seen another book that has come out after this one. I would have liked a more updated book than this 2000 version.
2,Surprised...I thought it was a Ktchenaid,I've purchased a Kitchenaid blender and food processor this year and since then stocked my kitchen with KA utensils since i equate the Kitchenaid name with high quality. Unfortunately this item like so many other Chinese-made pieces where companies slap their name onto it doesnt stand up. I noticed it was staining where the silicon head met the plastic handle and then a few weeks later a tear developed and then it was gone. This item was 2 weeks old and didnt serve any more strenuous duty than mixing batter or stirring a sauce. I may try the French Made Le Creuset Spatulas next. Ive learned that regardless of the name check on the quality and where it is manufactured.
2,Spatula,"I ordered this item, but the handle gets very hot when near the heat. I would not buy it again."
5,Add this to your library,"I'm not a fan of compilations since they tend to be uneven and often predictable but this one is an exception to the rule. It is by turns affirming and profoundly sad. The themes of conflict and acceptance, shame and forgiveness have rarely been touched upon in such a sensitive way. I found it terribly affecting and emotionally honest without it being sentimental. The sort of confessional, self-revelatory writing sometimes runs the risk of sounding preachy or self-rightous; this book succeeds precisely because it does neither. I'd recommend it to parents, gay or straight, as well as to their children."
2,"Book is a hodgepodge, more bad than good","Despite its title, this volume does not take us beyond ""The Godfather."" It indiscriminately mixes essays by writers who understand the Italian American experience (such as Richard Gambino) with those who only pretend to (such as Gay Talese) and those who actually despise their heritage (such as Marianna De Marco Torgovnick). As such, it does a poor job of countering negative stereotypes."
2,Most essays here are a waste.,"This book was a real let-down. Some of the contributors had nothing constructive to say, and a few others, like Gay Talese and Matilda Cuomo, although writing well, did not really address issues as they relate to Italian-Americans. On the positive side, some of the pieces on Italian-American litterature, and one woman's account of her struggle to learn the mandolin, were enjoyable."
5,Perfect Condition,"Shipped quickly. Perfect condition. Small, indistinguishable publisher's mark.Great book if you're interested in the personal histories of Italian-American writers. Great primary sources for research papers. Fascinating, enthralling book."
3,didn't see any difference.,"hoped to be as pleased as others, but just wasn't. I do think you have to try for yourself, only time tells if a product is what your system is in need of."
4,Great product,"We have a two door car with rear windows that don't roll down. This product replaced two Fisher Price self tinting film sun screens. After a few months, those would no longer become dark in the sun. This product has been great. The only tricky part is smoothing all of the air bubbles out during installation. If done properly, these will stick fine. We have had no problem with them coming off and the dark tint keeps the sun out of junior's eyes. Highly recommended product, but shipping makes it a little expensive. Not sure how well these work on windows that roll down."
2,Displeased,"These cling-on shades are ridiculous, they can't stick right and have countless air bubbles and you can't even open the window without it peeling off. Also with the ridiculous air-bubbles it is hard to look through the window when changing lanes. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
2,having trouble installing it,It seems based on other reviews that some people are able to install it easily and they are happy with it. The people who are not happy are ones who are not able to install it cleanly. I am having difficullty too although I am usually very good with these type of do-it-yourself things. No matter how hard I try it seems almost imposible to put them on without major wrinkles and bubbles. Since it is not installed cleanly it doesn't look good but the product seems to work ok - it keeps the sunlight out and stays on even with the bibbles and wrinkles.
3,It's okay,It's cheap but does its job. Goes on easily but some wrinkles are inevitable. Doesn't block out the sun completely but helps. I'd get it again though. I like how it comes in a 2 pack.
2,"Easy install, but too dark","I purchased these to install on the rear window of my sedan. They are fairly easy to install, and not too difficult to get smooth/remove bubbles if you take your time. My only issue is that the tint is way too dark. I can barely see out of my back window, even on the brightest of days."
2,Not worth aiming for the cheap side,"We bought this instead of the pull back shades, thinking it'd work well and be easy to install. Was very hard to get flat and straight on the window and pealed up when you lowered the window (this wasn't a huge surprise and was discovered by accident). Wouldn't buy again and would just get the pull down shade in the future."
2,Not sturdy,"If your good with putting on things smoothly, then this is for you. Me on the other hand had some difficulties since it's so sticky and like plastic, it keeps scrunching together."
1,inconvenient and thus useless,inconvenient and thus useless -- i used it once (it was irritating to put on) -- i removed after the sun was no longer shining through the window (so that my kid can see better) and it was difficult to store and then got dirty and i never used it again.useless!
1,Cheap Chinese Crap,This stuff wouldn't stick to windows or anything else except itself. I threw it in the trash and made some curtains from an old sheet. Thanks Amazon.
2,not enough,"Long and short of it - I'm getting my windows professionally tinted tomorrow. This screen just isn't enough for a rear-facing baby, who's frequently blinded by sun coming through the rear window, and around the edges of this screen. If you have a rear-facing infant and won't be in the back seat to monitor the sun on her face, I'd recommend professional tinting. If you have an older child facing forward and are looking to save money ($4 vs $250) then this screen is probably a fine place to start. In fact, I wouldn't be convinced that it's essential to get my windows tinted if I hadn't tried this shade first.But if you are going to use it and want the sun well blocked, you might buy two and cut extra strips to fit around the edges because quite a bit of light comes through around the top and sides of this shade, since it's not fitted exactly to your windows. It looks ugly, but isn't a bad temporary solution (e.g. for grandparents having the kids for the summer, or that sort of thing)."
4,Great for the price,"This does the job for the price you pay. I didn't want to spend any more money than I had to on a sunshade and I didn't want one with any characters on it. This is a good deal, 2 for $5. I have had mine for a year and haven't had any problems with it falling off. My nephew has rolled down the window a few times with it on and we have always gotten it back up (sometimes having to pull the window up as we push the button), but I don't think its a good idea to routinely roll it down. I never bothered to try to put it on super smoothly, there are a lot of air bubbles in mine but it doesn't affect performance, and like I said I try to keep the window up."
1,what a disappointment!,"I usually am so pleased with the quality of Sunshine Kids products. In fact, we own three of their carseats. I purchased this sun shade for our minivan thinking it would be great since the suction sunshades never seem to work for us (constantly falling down or pulled of windows). This product was such a disappointment! Small, silly piece of removable material that is impossible to even get on without air bubbles. They should be embarrased to charge more than $1 for this excuse for a shade! Do not recommend investing in this."
3,Loses points on ease of use,"These little window shades come in packs of two, which was a surprise to my daughter. Once installed, they work really wonderfully. However, if you are a perfectionist like I am, they are EXTREMELY difficult to get on the window without bubbles or lines. They are also dark enough that it's more difficult to see through the window in the dark. These would be far more useful if they were easily removable."
2,Works okay except dont like bubbles,"I think the trick is in the apolication. Some kind of roller would be nice. You just cant beat the price. Overall a Nice shade, reasonably easy to apply, but can be unsightly if there are air bubbles. Doesn't cover whole window unfortunately."
5,Very hard to apply,"I'm a smart, able-bodied person who can do most things I set my mind to, but these things are very difficult to apply without leaving bubbles underneath, which is just fugly.My windows were too small, too, so the material has to be cut to size, which was also a pain in the butt.I gave up and bought one of the Eddie Bauer ones that just grabs the top of the window with clips and pulls down like a shade. Much easier to apply and move."
1,Air bubbles and cheap looking,It takes about 10 minutes to install one of these since it is impossible to get all the air bubbles out. With all the air bubbles and wrinkles it looks terrible.
3,decent value,We drive 2 larger cars and although i found those easy to apply they are a bit small for or windows (and again too large to fit 2 in one window).I was able to remove and replace them which is convient but am still on the search for a great window solution as we have a lot of sun where we live...
4,Nice shade,"Nice shade, pretty easy to apply, but can be ugly if there are air bubbles. Doesn't cover whole window."
3,"Good idea, but far from perfect","The shade is very dark which is excellent for good sun protection, but requires the driver to be excruciatingly careful with the blind spot checks. From the point of crash safety it is much safer than any roll up shade (which can detach in a crash and injure the child).Bubbles were still a problem even though I read the previous reviews and followed their suggested best practices. I cleaned the window with alcohol, and tried to smooth out the shade with a piece of plastic (bank card), but the bubbles persisted and the material kept wrinkling in the process.It's not a bad solution, and among what is available it is still my favorite, but there is much room for improvement."
4,like it so far,"Arrived quickly. I didn't realize there would be two in a package, which was nice. Application went fairly smoothly. Not perfect, as there are still little bubbles and streaks. Perhaps if I'd used something to smooth it out, it would have looked more perfect. But I didn't bother because it looks fine as it is. There is no ""Diono"" brand logo on the item, which doesn't really matter to me, but I thought I'd put that in the review. Overall, I'm pleased with the outcome. All I wanted was something to lighten the impact of the sun on my daughter's face while in the car, and this seems to do the trick. I applied this only yesterday, so I can't say much to the durability yet. If I remember :) I will update after a while on its adhesiveness.*UPDATE* This product has stayed stuck on my window with no reapplication or rolled corners, etc... at all in over a year! It's holding up quite nicely!!"
1,You get what you paid for.,"Well, I know I paid less than $10 for this product. I placed it on my windshield based on the instructions provided and there were air bubbles everywhere. It's really sticky so you must be extremely careful as to not damage the cheap plastic. It's almost impossible to get rid of those air bubbles. I drove my vehicle for about 2 weeks with it on. You can see outside but it's very difficult for others to see inside unless they look very closely. Which, I really liked.. I had to take it off because I drive a nice sleek car but seeing a piece of plastic with air bubbles, made my car look cheap."
2,Shade for Window...,"Not very happy. Didn't stick well, stay on well, or block the whole window. Spend a few more bucks on a better item."
2,Very dark - block side vision,This shade is easy to install but is much darker than I would expect. We installed this on the driver's side rear window for our little one. And while it keeps the sun out of his eyes - it almost completely blocks the ability to look through that window when backing up or lane changing. We installed a different shade that allowed for easier outward viewing.
3,So now I can't roll down my windows?,So not cool. I probably should have thought this purchase through more and considered that possibility. Instead I ended up tossing these and just having the windows tinted.
5,works well!,you get two of these bad boys in a pack. they work so well i thought about doing the whole car. because at least its temporary. i looked in those roll up kind for baby and i didnt want to spend that kind of money so i went to thrift stores and yard sales and everyone i saw was cracked and had a weird pissy plastic smell. not something i want trapped in a hot car or near my baby. these are a life saver!
4,exactly what we were expecting,"It works well, is easy to install. you can't roll the window down, obviously, while it's attached. For the price, it's a nice option to have while driving on a sunny day."
2,Difficult to see,"It's very difficult to put this product on without any bubbles. I simply don't have the patience to adjust and readjust. That being said, it did serve it's purpose, and that's reducing the amount of sun that gets to my son, but my biggest problem with it is that it is very dark. I read the reviews of others, and thought I would be able to handle the darkness. It was only installed on the back driver side window. But after driving with it for a few days, i found myself checking and re-checking my blind spot. Maybe it just takes getting used to...but I've since removed it. Also, it is tacky looking, but I can get over that as long as it works."
1,Looks cheap.,Very difficult to put on window without significant bubbles since windows are slightly curved. Looks cheap. Bought two packages. End up throwing them away.
4,It is her best.,"The songs included are some of my favorites. They are much more complex than they sound, and difficult to play/sing. You definitely should be more on the advanced side to get through these successfully. It makes me appreciate her music even more."
2,More an Advertisement than a How To,"This book did three things very well: (1) described how the author brought a financial services practice to his CPA firm in a very personalized way (that is to say, not particularly applicable to others); (2) rationalized his decision to become a commissions-based IAR of a broker-dealer rather than a truly independent fee-based RIA; and (3) made a nice pitch on behalf of that broker-dealer. I gave this two stars rather than one, because it's not totally useless for those of us looking at expanding our tax practice into financial services, it's just only incidentally helpful."
5,Great Value! Gets 5 stars in my book!,"If you love F1 you will love this game. Ok, Graphics and Sounds are not as clean as the EA version but it depends on what you are looking for in a F1 Game: The overall Gameplay is closer to the real thing then any other Racing game in terms of all rules & regulations etc. (On the EA version you'll find a Minardi on the Pole position!???!) Forget Arcade here..... Learn the tracks, feel the car in wet and dry, practice and your in, just like the real drivers. Replay is a beauty, view from ANY CAR, from ANY ANGLE! Drivers are agressive and have real character. Menu rocks with real Samples of 18000 rpm! Spectator Mode is cool also. Save your Game almost any time, after the Warm up or after a great Hot lap and race later. Couple bugs found in heavy crashes.... froze on me once! Other than that, nothing but fun or should I say stress.... I give this a 5, I love F1. Perhaps the average Gamer will give this a 3.5 - 4.0. but I can recommend this to any real F1 fan."
1,Ps2 world is fun but this item isn't,Ok kids. you'll already be coming in and taking Robert Scott Brimer Out Of Ps2 world. This is hollywood racing and i hate games like that Not fun letting sony release this junk ! ! ! Schumacher spinning around if you play this Buy the european PS1 version.
1,Get the EA Sports Formula One game Instead!!!!!,"Before the release of this 989 Sports version of F1 racing, I had seen a number of great reviews on Web sites concering the previous, Europe-only versions of the game from past years. Perhaps 989 Sports simply ""failed"" in translating it to the North American market, but Formula One 2001 is absolutely terrible. The graphics are rather corny, the handling is impossible and rather unforgiving, and sounds need more work, and there is very little sense of realism - all absolutely unexcusable on a console as powerful as the PS2.On the other hand, the new EA Sports game (F1 2001) is a veritable dream. Any serious F1 gamer/fan should instead spend their money on F1 2001, the continuation of EA Sports' excellent line of F1-based games."
2,Sony games are meant to be always good,"and I read good reviews so I bought this without renting it first. Apart from being impossible to control the steering is so sensitive you can't turn corners smoothly and the understeer is terrible, the wheels turn but the car slides straight on. As well as this there are not enough views to choose from. And why are the tyres so square? Buy Formula One 99 or 97 instead"
2,Unacceptable game from Sony/989 Sports,"I am a F1 fan and have been following since late 80's. I played all F1 games whenever possible. Many reviews gave high marks, right. Who're these reviewers??? This game is uncontrollable without activating the ABS and traction control! It understeers all the time and the brakes fail on me regardless of esses, chicanes or hairpins. I read the Euro-version is different. What did 989 Sports do, I don't know. I am on my way to get a copy of EA's version, that's for sure."
2,Don't buy this game!,Previous poor reviews are right on the money. (...) The graphics are all wrong (they look nothing like the real on-screen timing and scoring that we are used to seeing) the sound sucks and the steering is horrible. (...)
2,Terrible CDS,The only good mix on this CDS is the Offer Nissim mix if you haven't already bought Offer's Perfect Love CDS with that mix on it as a bonus track. You can hear the samples of the mixes on Beatport. The mixes are bad if not terrible. The only decent mix is the Jose Spinnin' Cortez Tribe Tek Mix. I don't even want to listen again to other mixes of Be My Boyfriend. The Peter Rauhofer Mix of Perfect Love is so bad (not tribal) and weak (his new electro sounding is not my type at all) and a bit too quiet - try adding +2db to it. Buy what you must at Beatport. It may be cheaper that way. You decide.
5,The best of the best!,"I had this in tape back on 1997 when I started college. I downloaded it again a few years ago, and can't stop loving each and every track. I am so glad both Rocio and Juan Gabriel got to record this at that time. To this day, my favorite huapangos with Rocio and amazing duets are contained in this collection."
3,"Looks good, does its job","I got this for my mom for her new razor. she liked the color and it does its job. The one thing i'm not too fond of is the top part of the phone isn't covered. It may need to be that way though for when you flip your phone open . it works though, and decent price"
2,Buy real book,"Don't buy this (copied by a computer) version of book. It's a great book and essential in any spider-lovers library but this particular copy is littered with errors. For example the ""spiders"" (yes, the main subject of the entire piece) is spelled ""opiders"" throughout the entire book. Incredibly annoying, should have read the fine print about purchasing these types of books. Buy original!"
3,Could have been better,"I really would not recommend this book to others. It does not give enought information on how to make it as a freelance writer or how to make good money. I would recommend Robert Bly's book Secrets of a Freelance Writer : How to Make $85,000 a Year or How to Start a Home-Based Writing Business by Lucy Parker. I believe that these books give more actual information on how to get started, where to look for business and how to price your services. Bly's book is primarily about commercial writing but is worth buying whether you are doing magazine or commerical writing."
3,What about the other episodes?,"This is a great show! I would like to purchase it, however, I would like the whole season. Please include the other eight epsisodes."
4,Neat Style,"First of all I enjoyed the Shedaisy's one song, Little Goodbyes very much. This just enhances my love for the group's style. I like the way they sing this song, Deck the Halls. To find out what I mean you have to get it. They put a different twist to the way they sing it. They seem to take the same poetic liscense for music that Chip Davis and his Mannheim Steamroller take for their Christmas albums. I personally like the old Chirstmas classics sung and played a little different. It brings a new twist to something heard often. Buy this CD and enjoy it all year long!"
3,SHOW-OFF SINGERS,"sHEDAISY are just a bunch of girls who think they can get fan and fortune by looking and acting sassy. i think that you can listen to their music , but don`t get carried away. they put on a real big act by singing."
5,"Subtle, Melodic, Lyrical and Continues To Grow On You","Sam Broussard's ""Geeks"" CD is one of those rare find recordings that you stumble upon that makes the art of music so magical. Broussard, from Lafayette, Louisiana, displays a mastery of guitar musicianship and songwriting that incorporates the acoustic folk and jazz influences from the bayou state into an eclectic masterpiece. Excellent, thoughtful lyrics are poetically integrated into melodies that are mature and memorable (- the kind that stick in your mind...). This CD continues to grow on you with each playing. Its real art, people! Highly recommended."
5,Great seller....fast service,Bought this for a Christmas present for an elderly gentleman who loves Nat King Cole. He was thrilled to get it. Brand new gift.
2,Nat King Cole 10 CD set.,"I was excited to find a 10 CD set of Nat King Cole because I had been unable to find one. However, I was expecting all of the music on these CDs to be Nat King Cole singing. I was disappointed that many of them are just the jazzs piano version with no singing."
4,A good first exposure to flap books,"This is a small book that has Sesame Street characters hiding behind flaps. The flaps are all different shapes, not just the standard rectangles. My daughter got this at about 14 months and still really likes it at 18 months. She says ""knock knock"" and the other sounds that the characters use: ""tap tap"" ""crank crank"" etc. Favorite page: when Elmo pops out of a birthday cake and says ""surprise!"" All major Sesame characters appear in the book. It's inexpensive and so far has remained durable."
5,A highly entertaining read!,"I really enjoyed this story of two people who have to learn to trust again. Jake is a wonderful hero, and I have a confessed weakness for bodyguard stories. This one is right up there with the best! Don't miss it!"
5,A Story of Hot and Cold Running Heartaches,"Imagine the pain Laura and Jake would suffer had this story been real. Adrianne's clear writing style makes their love one you'll want to read about again.Her depiction of an alzeimer's patient is top notch, and I thank her for giving us such a satisfying, believable ending with regard to it.This book is an exciting read that leaves you full of hope and caring for for Laura and Jake, and full of satisfied smiles.Very, very well done!"
3,Dated data; what has happened since?,"Although I have read all of the Ryan Saga in print, from (in Ryan chronological order) Patriot Games to Executive Orders, I feel that the Companion gives an honest account of the Ryan lifetime. A question exists: in Red Storm, what has happened to the major characters since the events of the (thank God, unfought on our timeline) WW3? Assuming the line exists, I'd like to know what has happened since."
4,Purchased for Grandson,I purchased this set of Toy Story characters for my 3 year old grandson.He knows all their names and especially liked Buzz.
3,Slow to ship,I needed this toy has a birthday gift that was 2 weeks away from the date I purchased it - the product didn't come till much after - I had to buy another gift for the child...
1,Flavor Flav's watch,This watch does have cool gadgets but be warned it is thick and round. I have big hands and wrists but could not get past the size of this watch. I sent it back and later purchased the updated pathfinder (PAW-1300). The PAW-1300 is sleeker and I am way more pleased with it.
4,Better than docksiders,"When looking for a pair of slip on shoes to wear in the summer I ran across a sale on these Rocket Dogs, having already owed a pair of boots by the company I knew that the quality was excellent and there would be some style points.I have had them for a few months, the white gets more like a silver grey, but they are holding up well and much cheaper than the mocs I had been wearing for years."
1,Terrible sizing ended up not fitting at all,"I really wanted to make the Rocket Dog shoes work. They're stylin and eco-friendly (the white hemp version is). Problem is Rocket Dog doesn't realize guys won't wear shoes that don't fit.I'm normally a size 11-12, so I ordered one of each. Didn't fit. Returned and ordered a 10.5. Didn't fit because the shoes still slipped quite a bit when walking. I could tell they would end up giving me blisters on my heel if I did any serious walking. Returned and ordered a 10. This time they were too small and compressed my toes.Whoever is in charge of sizing @ Rocket Dog should be fired. I've never been so frustrated with fitting shoes. If you really want these, find them in a store somewhere and try them on. DON'T ORDER THEM ONLINE or you'll be spending lots of money on return shipping."
1,rocket dog men's slip on,they looked ok in the picture. but on the feet they felt simply awful. i just tossed them.
4,Great Idea!,"Someone who actually cooks came up with this spatula. It really gets down into the corners and edges of bowls and pans to clean out each and every drop of batter. I love it! The price is a little high for a spatula but if it is durable and works properly, it will be worth it."
1,dissapointed,"I bought this dishdrainer and used it in my sink for a couple of years. It worked fine, didn't break, but the coating came off on the upper part of the rack in the corners where it touched my sink. It rusted, therefore put rust marks on the sink."
3,Rubbermaid Home 6008-AR-BISQU Twin Sink Dish Drainer,"I have bought Rubbermaid dish drainers for years for their performance and sturdiness mainly and am very happy with them, especially when they come with a silverware holder for the price paid. The picture on the label even shows it has one but mine came without one. What am I supposed to do with the silverware? I would give this item 5 stars except for this problem."
2,inferior quality control and manufacturing,"I remember when Rubbermaid used to be a good company making a quality product,not anymore.I bought this dish drainer,a sink mat,and a sink divider mat,all Rubbermaid brand,all Bisque colored.The problem is all three items are a completely different colored Bisque than the other two pieces.Obviously Rubbermaid does not practice quality control any longer and has multiple interpretations of the color Bisque.The overall quality of the items was nothing special either,the silverware containers poor design on the dish strainer is a perfect example.These products are not cheap to purchase either,the set of three was $34 ,a pretty hefty sum for some poorly maid junk."
4,hat,I bought this for my 2 year old and now he is 4 and he still wears it and he loves it. Fits for a long time.
5,Nice hex wrench with good grip,I prefer Pedro's tools over park tool whenever I have the option. I feel like the build quality is just as good and they're always a little cheaper. The grip is soft yet firm and both ends of the wrench are very strong. I've over torqued my pedals buy accident and stripped the pedal but end of the wrench doesn't even have a scratch on it. I highly recommend pedro's tools.
2,"Irritating characters, crummy editing","This book looked interesting, but halfway through I am finding it so irritating that I may not finish it. The main characters are unappealing so far; here's hoping they change.Who edited this book? The editing is poor enough to stand out; the who's for whom's are not as bad, however, as the whom's and whomever's replacing their nominative forms.For me, this book is a waste of time."
5,"Tony Judt's ""A Grand Illusion""","I have discovered Judt's work only in the last few years. His writing and thinking is lucid, and his analysis and ideas provocative in the good sense. His different views of many of the problems facing contemporary Europe are as important as they are unconventional."
1,Quality bag...too small,I have a Fender Squier Strat...gig bag doesn't even come close to fitting...bummer! It would help to know before purchase as to fitting standard electric guitars like a Strat...
1,Sorry there isn't a rating lower than 1,Although Eva Shaw is a good instructor in her teleclasses. This book is a waste of time. Almost 3/4 of it is lined blank pages. The exercises are also very unimaginative.
2,40 pages of content and 140 pages of lines to write on,"This book has 4o light pages of content and 140 pages of note lines for you to write on.It's a nice little exercise book, but I would never have spent $15.00 in a book store after having seen the lack of content. This is all information you can find on any writing website dedicated to how to write. The content it does have is good, just not for the price. I would pay $5.00 for it on whim.Also, her ""Bubble"" writing technique is the same as Mind Mapping.It is a great technique for creative discovery."
2,writerriffic,"Disappointing in that half the pages are blank, meant for you to write in. Hello, I could write the exercises in a notebook!"
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS,"I love this book and the inspiration it brings to me every time I pick it up. Eva's words are both soothing ( you can do this) and challenging (you know you want to write so here is how you break on through to the other side).This book is worth its weight in gold! As a college-level teacher of writing, I recommend this book to all my students."
5,Great investment in my creative writing,"Don't let the small price of this must-have writing book make you think it's ho-hum. It's has become just the spark I've needed to keep the momentum going in my writing career, after a lengthy bout with writer's block. The exercises are simple, ""deceptively simple"" according to Dr. Shaw, and have made me stretch more than I thought possible. Now my creative thinking has changed and it seems that everyday I see and understand more of what I'm to do as a writer. Besides the book is fun and the advice is timely, non intimidating and just as encouraging as Dr. Shaw is in person. I've attended some of her online writing classes and that coupled with this incredible investment has propelled me to selling three articles and placing a number of essays. If you're in a period of doubting your creativity, get this book. I did and I'm telling all my writing friends."
1,This is NOT worth your money and time!!!,"You can find the exercises in many other writing books, nothing very new or special here. And, hey, I already have a journal (many of them for that matter) and 3/4 of the book is empty writingspace! So my advice would be: buy another book with writing exercises and look for a blank journal.....many of those out there!!"
1,1 star is too much!,I found this book to be very boring. I felt like two different people had written it. Both being very young children. I don't understand how a book this bad could possibly get published.Very weak! I would not suggest this book to anyone.
1,Not Bad for a Novice,"This book would be really good for young teens. There is no real surprise with the main character Mordrid. It is quite obvious he was going to be the new savior and you can figure out the plot much to easily. And the ""Lord of Darkness"" character Vlad, sorry very boring and he goes nowhere.I wasn't too crazy about the drawings in the book. Although each person has their own view of art and it is subjective, I did not find these drawings very appealing.As for a vampire story, this one seemed to have a good idea but the writing was not up to par and the dialogue was much too juvenile.All in all, I would not purchase the second book in the series as I had a really hard time finishing this first one."
5,Great doco on doco-making,Many inspiring quotes and opinions from a wide range of documentary makers - iti's especially interesting when they contradict each other's ideas in their separate interviews. Also a good introduction to a range of doco films that I wasn't aware of but will now seek out. it would have been nice to see more of the film-makers in action but this is a small quibble.
1,not worth the plastic,"This DVD just interviews some documentary filmmakers and one says one thing, another says something completely different. Bottom line, just get out there and do it in your own style. Very little if any technical details on using film making equipment or lighting, or sound suggestions. Mainly dialog of personal opinions. Very boring. Sorry I bought it, but you never know. Too bad I couldn't have rented it first."
4,Flannel sheets review,"I prefer to use flannel sheets over cotton sheets because they are gentler on baby's skin. I live in a climate where the murcury dips down into the upper twentys at times. Flannel sheets are warmer than most others. They tend to hold baby's body temperture in better. Even in the summer time I am able to use these sheets. With the airconditioning blowing, I am confident that my baby is warm and snuggly. I would reccommend flannel sheets to anyone!"
4,Tons of Fun!,"Despite the morbidity of the theme, these are really cute! The kids love them, and they are lots of fun."
1,How did this happen?,"I intended to buy 3 mugs, each of a different color.If the order page default for these mugs is Item 1, how did this happen?Note that this is not a comment on the quality of the mugs(solicited by Amazon) NOR is it a comment on the quality of your packing(also solicited by Amazon). This is a comment on the quality of your Ordering Process (solicitation Notably Absent).A modest proposal - Speedy Delivery as all who have grown up exposed to ""Mr. Rogers neighborhood"" know is a desirable attribute. However I suggest that you present a relatively uncluttered Order Review/Confirmation page exhibiting prominently (highlighting, reverse contrast blinking, etc.) the actual Selections (benefits) and the costs & cost total. This action will make clear that you have the customer's best interests in mind as well as your own.I will likely keep the extra mug,A loyal customer - Harryrotatun@yahoo.comTWIMC"
5,10-ounce mug,"We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years. They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.I have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below, but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together, not just by the handle. Fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand.(They are made like hotel china, essentially. Homer Laughlin is a hotel china company, in fact. The first set of dishes I had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line.)For a bigger cup for cafe au lait style, I can recommend the Fiestaware ""jumbo cups."" We have a set of those in Sea Mist and use them for coffee, but also for heating soup in the microwave. They are both great. Never been disappointed with Fiestaware."
4,cute little choc. mug,We had purchased a set of 5 but the mug was smsller so we wanted to get the larger mug and found this one to purchase by itself.
1,Save your money!,"I loved mine for a year that it worked. After about 6 uses and just less than a year, while making a cake the handle finally broke! I was thinking of replacing it with another Kitchen Aid $10 spatula, but why should a spatula last only 1 year and cost $10? They look super cool with the silver trim, but they don't seem to be well-made. I will have to research a NON-KitchenAid spatula because this one does not make the grade! I am moving on to another brand."
5,A must have in any kitchen!,"The KitchenAid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect. They are very will made and excellent quality. The silicone material is amazing, it is so easy to clean, whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix, cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it. The curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my All Clad mixing bowls. With this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl. Highly recommended!"
3,Great spatula but don't believe the dishwasher-safe hype,"We received this spatula as a wedding gift a few years ago. The spatula worked very well in a wide variety of culinary scenarios. After use, we always washed the spatula by hand and were extremely satisfied with the quality of materials and construction. However, about 3 months ago we began washing the spatula in the dishwasher and, almost immediately, noticed a change. The edges quickly became worn and seemingly more brittle. Soon a crack began to develop along the top edge. My wife tried cleaning some food that had become lodged in the now prominent crack and a large piece of the spatula broke-off. Our once wonderful spatula has now been retired to the garbage can. Would I buy this spatula again? Probably. Would I put it in the dishwasher again? Never."
4,Great Multimedia Case,This case has lots of what you need for a home multimedia rig. The harddrives have a cushion that stops them from making any noise and the look is great.I have Vista Ultimate installed and the front display works flawlessly.I would have given it a 5 star except for the lack of additional drive bays. I have it setup with 2 drives doing RAID and if you need more then that you will have to use a NAS.Great case overall.
1,Mine broke too,"I loved this spatula until it broke - which wasn't after too many uses (about 10 or so). For me, it was the end part that broke, not the middle or the handle, but the wide part you can take off the end while washing. I paid a fair bit of money for this - even though it was purchased on sale, so I can't see myself buying another though it definitely worked quite well and was loved. Also, it wasn't put through particularly heavy work, so I don't think I could just be careful with it next time. Honestly, they look cool and work well, and are a good brand, but I would recommend you save some money and buy a different product."
1,"neck breaks, middle breaks too","I had this spatula less than a year and it broke between the spatula head and the neck. I had one other red kitchenAid spatuala and it broke too, but it broke at the insertion of the silver ring. So it broke in half. I was not doing anything unusual. My cheap ugly spatulas are still going strong after 7 years."
2,Inconsistent,"I've been trying to use the Firewave with a G5 iMac and a Logitech 5.1 setup. My results are very inconsistent. I cannot get the ""virtual surround"" Prologic II mode to work at all. Just silence when it's turned on. Surround sound DVDs and DVD-As :: sometimes they'll play in surround sound, sometimes they'll just be silent. It's impossible to tell what makes what work or not. There is nothing in the Troubleshooting guide that comes with the product that helps you out with these issues. Probably a waste of your money."
1,Problem with hardware and/or software . . .,"After installing the software on the CD and testing out the Firewave card . . . I started to notice that the songs from my iTunes were skipping quite a bit. I played around the Firewave settings for a while but nothing helped with the skipping problem. This problem is frequent enough for one not to just ignore it . . . this is in fact would be what I consider a show-stopper. The other minor issue is that the Firewave application has to be running all the time if you want surround sound. The settings in the Firewave app keep resetting themselves with each time you open the application, thus requiring the user to manually set the settings everytime the Firewave application is opened. That is absolutely asinine.*********** UPDATE ***********okay, i've contacted the company about the problem and they believed it was due to a faulty firewire cable that came with the product. they shipped a free cable out to me, and it fixed the problem."
3,Griffin FireWave Surround Sound,Good idea but no way to adjust volume for each speaker. When volume is turned past medium there is a loud irritating vibration on low frequencies that was not present before the FireWave was connect up.
5,marvelous sound,"It's easy to config FireWave and speakers! The sound is clear, brilliant and perfect! There's no better soundcard for MAC-Computers! I'm pleasantly surprised. There are no problems with the new LION."
5,FireWave rocks the house!,This device is great overall. The product is is easy to set up and use. The footprint is small and the unit is light so it can be stacked on other devices. Worth every penny.
4,FireWave,"Its compact and all the cables fit. The pro logich works on certain songs, meaning in some songs the sound improveswhile in others it gets worse.I wanted to use it for my macbook pro and so far has done the job."
5,saved the sound!,Because of this FireWave sound adapter I am able to keep using my awesome 5.1 surround system for music and games. I was afraid my new iMac was gonna have to suck for a while until I could buy comparable speakers but instead the whole system continues to rock because of the firewave. I also paid 12 bucks instead of 70 which adds the warm fuzzies.
5,Solved all my problems..,Sound quality is fantastic however word to the wise if you have a new imac you also need to buy a sonnet firewire 400 to 800 adapter for it to fit the 800 firewire port on the Imac.
3,More Brains Plz,If you like the office. If your a zombie fan than this is the toy for you. Actually I may disagree with my last statement. These little guys and gals represent all of office folks. For some of us that wish they were any where hear. The reviewer wanted to know what the glow in the dark feature is for. Its for the zombies that have to work late night and all the light have been cut off.
2,A chore to finish....,"Just a few words - This was not even close to being as good a story as 'Amanda's Wedding'. The characters in 'Talking To Addison' were sooo boring and the storyline lost me many times. Quite frankly, Holly needed a good slap and I really hoped that Addison did NOT wake from his coma."
4,"An easy, fun read for a lazy summer day","I thoroughly enjoyed the antics of Holly and her flatmates. Every page that I turned in this book had me anticipating more of Holly's ploys and mishaps to gain the attention of Addison and make social connections with other characters in the book. It truly had me laughing out loud. My only disappointment with the book came with the ending. The whole hospital bit seemed to drag on and on, and the actual ending seemed somewhat misaligned with the intentions of the characters. I guess I was just expecting the obvious, but was surprised instead. And as a side note, the excessive use of profanity might be offensive to some people. Another good book to try of Ms. Colgan's is Amanda's Wedding."
2,Not nearly as good as I hoped,"This was not nearly as good as Amanda's Wedding. It was rather disappointing, but I kept reading in the hopes that something good would come. It was a little funny here and there, but not laugh out loud funny like Amanda's Wedding."
4,Funny!,"I definitely liked Bridget Jones's Diary better, but this book was very funny, too! It's a laugh-out-loud book!!"
2,pretty boring,"I have been reading this book and I am about 20 pages from the end. I was going to say that unless something really outstanding takes place in those 20 pages, I wouldn't recommend it, but the truth is, even if that is the case, I still would not recommend this book. There are a few laugh outloud moments, but all in all..it bores me to tears."
1,Big Let Down,"What can I say? I never even bothered to finish it...This book was a big disappointment, as I expected better from Jenny Colgan. Amanda's Wedding was funny, gripping, had loveable characters...but I just don't know what happened in Talking to Addison.This book was just so boring!!! The plot was sluggish, the characters were under developed and, frankly, odd and unrealistic.Not once did I laugh...This book wasn't 'fluffy'....no, this book was just pointless.This book is not worth the buy or the read. Pick up Amanda's Wedding instead."
2,Incredible disappointment...,"I read, and loved, Amanada's Wedding. It was funny, fast-paced, and had characters you could identify with and a villian you loved to hate. So when I saw Talking to Addison, I was very excited to read it. I do have to admit that there were funny parts to this book, and I actually kind of liked the ending (despite the fact that a lot of the events leading to it were highly unrealistic). But, it was actually painful to get through the entire middle portion of the story! I was very disappointed in this book. Unless you are a HUGE Jenny Colgan fan, I wouldn't bother with this one."
2,Funny Until It Falls Off The Rails,"""Talking to Addison"" begins as a very quirky, funny, British read, with its protagonist, Holly Livingstone, spewing one liners about and insults to her insane flatmates, coworkers, and the world in general. The author does well in establishing the novel's place and in creating Holly's voice and, to a certain extent, her friends. However, the characters and the subject are all things we've seen and read before, in more successful ways. Holly and her cohorts remain two-dimensional, underemployed, disillusioned twentysomethings. As for the plot, it carries along nicely until the final third where it completely goes off into a far-fetched farce. While the last act holds a few smiles, all I could do was wonder where Addison's mother was in all of this mess, as she completely disappears at the most crucial time. The novel becomes unbelievable and loses any of its earlier charm."
5,$5.99?? Seriously! WOW! Order one now!,"I should have ordered more as gifts. As a matter of fact, I probably will! Very well made! And it is much smaller than regular chargers!"
2,Very Delicate,This case is so thin and delicate that it cracked within 2-3 weeks of using it even though the phone was not dropped ( not even once)
5,I loved this book,"I am a huge fan of the beautiful Joan Crawford, and I cannot express how refreshing it is to come across a book like this, that does not allow itself to be influenced by Joan's bad reputation of her later years.This book truly sets the record straight and presents Joan as a real human being - not as a monster and definitely not as a saint. The author made this book highly readable, while still being careful with his information. If he was not 100% sure of a piece of information, he would say so and present the reader with two different ways of looking at it.This book also contained great summaries of each and every one of her movies, starting with the silent years and moving all the way up to her infamous science fiction flicks.All through the book, Quirk gives us the bare facts, some of which are quite shocking and do show Joan's dark side. In the end, however, Joan comes through as a good human being, but more importantly as a great actress."
1,A Very Very Long Slanted Movie Review,Buy this book ONLY if you would like to read a very very long and very slanted (sometimes bitchy) movie review of Crawford's films. Also the information that is presented is not linear - the author(s) flip back and forth in time ALOT.
2,Joan Crawford--The Whitewash Biography,"Not only do the authors incorrectly describe plots of her most famous movies, notably The Women, they also completely overlook the fact that her cruelty to the children was well atested to by Helen Hayes and her son James McArthur. This book is not an even handed account of JC's life nor is it even a good reference to her movies."
4,the shining hour,"Lawrence J. Quirk was a writer who knew Joan intimately throughout her long and successful film profession. This is an important book because it truly described Joan's entire life in detail. It was also a great book that detailed most of her films and included a lot of classic pictures, which were even interspersed throughout the text."
2,Not Fair and Balanced,I am a 22 year old college graduate. This gift was given as a graduation present and I was excited. It had some interesting facts in it about her movies but the book is totally biased towards joan. She's painted as a saint for the most part. It is honest in some respects like how in the movie Johnny Guitar she feuded with Mercedes Mccambridge and how she slapped and hated men that rejected her.It bashed poor Christina too much. She probably did want to be a star and like her mother but she did not deserve what happened to her. Even if she was a bad seed (like the book painted her to be) it was because joan was such a bad mother. kids learn from their parents usually. Buy it for the films only forget about what it says about tina. Its not fair and balanced but its ok for filmography fun facts.
1,Definately NOT the 'Essential' biography,"Having only recently become a Crawford fan thanks to finally getting to see ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"" (thanks Amazon!) and recently reading ""Bette and Joan,The Divine Feud""... I was really looking forward to discovering much more the about the real person behind the legend and myth. Unfortunately this biography doesnt give you any of that. If you are looking for an in depth analysis of Ms Crawfords films and acting style then this is for you. Whilst I do tend to agree with the authors that 'Mommie Dearest' is very much a one sided hack job, this book does not go very far to counteract some of the stories presented by adopted daughter Christina in her biography, and present a balanced portrait of Ms Crawford flaws and all. Very dissapointing."
2,Boring,"I was very interested in the true life of Joan Crawford after seeing ""Mommy Dearest"". This book starts off well, but then quickly goes downhill. Describing in detail about each of her movies- such as who co-starred or what the idea of each movie was. I didn't order the book to get a movie review and that's about all it is."
1,Horrible Book,This is the worst biography ive ever had the misfortune of reading.It provides no real insight into Joans character and is loaded(too much ) with detailed plot summaries and key scenes of ALL HER MOVIES(over 70).A brief plot symnopsis and maybe a note of key scenes of her LANDMARK MOVIES instead of all her movies would of been appropiate.There's no sense of actually getting deeper into Joan Crawford as a person.All it was was she drank out her fith of vodlka(100th proof) and carried on a affair with so and so then a LOOONG summary of her next film.
3,"Essential bio maybe, but not the definitive","While I enjoyed reading this book, it is really about Joan Crawford's films with bits and pieces about her life tossed in. A lot of noise is made about her sex life; well -- personalities of the 20's, 30's 40's (until the mid-medieval 50's) went from bed to bed without remorse or conscience. Same sex partners were a very trendy thing -- Dietrich, Garbo, Piaf -- probably all of the stars of that era. So big deal.The consumate star -- okay; but she was a person, too. She liked to knit; she liked to spend evenings with a friend reading poetry out loud to each other. NOne of this is in this book. That's the biography I'd like to read!"
1,Hagiography--emphasis on the hag,"This books claims to be a serious study of Crawford's life and art--in truth it is nothing more than the gushings of two fans, one of whom clearly was one of Joan's many ""pals,"" willing to excuse any bad performance or ill-mannered action because they were allowed to be in her circle. The writers completely disavow any possibility that Christina Crawford told anything true in her memoir--with no more evidence to support their claim than Christina provided for hers. Their commentary on Crawford's performance is shallow, amateurish, and laughable. Shame on a university press for publishing this tripe."
5,Exactly what I needed!,Length:: 1:12 MinsThis brush worked great and was easy to use. Worth the price. See before and afters in the video.
3,Pretty good tool...,"Nice tool to clean the coils on the fridge, wasn't happy that shipping was more than the part."
2,No good for sound reduction,"We purchased these to use at night to cut down external noise to help in falling asleep. Have been using some industrial grade from work that work great, but we couldnt find them on line.'Tried these, and sitting acros the room with TV on low to moderate volme, an still hear the TV quite well.Maybe these are designed for another purpose, but didnt work for me."
2,A little simplistic,"Not a complex explanation of the industry but a surface level book. Nothing in here that could not be found on GoogleOverall, wait for a real good deal"
1,Several Factual Errors,"This book contains a number of factual errors.To site a few:pg. 57 ""Illinois Senator (and future president) Willian McKinley... When Frank Smith declared he would run against McKinley, Insull opened up his pocketbook and provided more than $25,000, a substanital sum in the 1920s."" What!?! McKinley was from Ohio, not Illinios. He served in the House and as Ohio's governor. He was never a senator. And he was assassinated in 1898.pg. 119 ""Eron... declared bankruptcy on December 2, 1997"" Wrong. Enron declared bankruptcy in 2001.pg. 108 ""providing energy payments from utilities that rose from 5.6 cents per kilowatt in 1984 to 10.1 cents in 1983 and even to 15 cents in 1998"" Huh? that doesn't make sense. Did this book have an editor?There are way too many errors in this book to take it seriously."
2,There must be something better....,"Very hard to assemble and forget about taking it a part after you do get it assembled. There has to be something better than this. But you get what you pay for, I guess."
3,Too hard to put together,"AFTER 2 HOURS I FINALLY GOT THE STUPID THING TOGETHER, THEN I WENT TO PUT ON THE WHEELS ONLY 3 FIT....FINALLY I JUST TOOK THE WHEELS OFF AND PUSHED IT IN THE CORNER"
1,"If we could, we'd give it a half a star",I wish I would have read the reviews earlier. This product is ridiculously difficult to assemble! We tried for about 2hr and only completed one little compartment. We decided to disassembly and take it back to the store. This manufacture really needs to spends sometime figuring out how to make this product more user-friendly.
1,piece of junk,we bought this to store my 3rd childs extra clothes in the playroom close to the portacrib. we thought it would be great we were wrong its a piece of junk. we've had it 2 days. In 2 days the caster haven fallen off as it was pushed into place and many little pieces have already cracked off also the thing just doesn't seem to stay together. we are returning it and getting some milk crates same thing better quality and cheeper. If you buy this good luck!!!
1,Worst Product Ever,"What a pile of junk. Words can't describe the hatred I hold towards whoever thought this a good product to sell. I would rather receive a colonoscopy than try to assemble another one of these. It looks so simple from the box, but really contains a hellish nightmare. I am a 28 year old male and have assembled MANY other things in my life, but this has been the worst by far. It is also not a very sturdy product, I'll be shocked if the product last more than 5 years.Im not a big complainer, but I just had to express my extreme displeasure with this ... that they call a nursery organizer."
1,Nursery Cart Organizer,"We bought this cart thinking it would be a great way to organize some of our newborn babys items. Well it took the two of us to put it together for nearly 20 minutes and the small plastic grooves that are suppose to keep each cube together snapped off and the wheels didn't slide onto the bottom, the track for that broke. It was so uneven, the cubes didn't lock together and it leaned forward and we had to be careful getting things in and out of the cart so it wouldn't fall over."
5,Great Organizer.......,"When I first saw this organizer cart, I thought to myself Wow!, that would be a wonderful gift for my aunt and will help a lot with the spacing, so I decided to look into it first just to see what other people thought about it before buying it. After reading all the reviews I started changing the way I felt about it, but still I decided to give it a try. The price isn't so bad, and if she really doesn't like it, I'll just return it and get her something else. So I did buy it, and my aunt loved it. Her husband built it, he followed the instructions step by step and in no time, he was done. I'd say it took him the most 30 minutes. Now she has it in her baby's room next to his crib, and it sure does hold a lot of items. You just need to have patience and follow instructions carefully. I truly believe it's a really good deal for that price and it's one of the best organizers out there. I know for sure, that I'll most definitely get me one for my future babies to come."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I found this not too difficult to put together although you have to force some pieces together. But once I had it together it was warped and the shelves did not stay in very secure. I stocked it with items like those in the picture, diapers, washclothes, onsies, etc. and the shelves did not hold the weight. After a few months and moving it around the wheels would not stay in anymore. But what do you expect for $20 I guess. Next time I would spend a little more and get something that is going to last."
2,"Looks nice, extremely difficult to assemble.",It is a nice product if you get this pre-assembled. You may need to spend more hours than shopping to assemble this with no guarantee of whether you will finish it. I spent more than 3 hours to assemble. Especially when you make mistake you will end up in breaking the plastic. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,Very useful product,"I purchased the nursery cart despite all the negative reviews but I will have to admit that it is a very good product. I had a hard time with the instructions as did many. It is serving its purpose. It is efficient for our apartment. I use the nursery cart for her clothes that she currently fits. And I also use it for her shoes and clean towels, bibs and hats."
3,Assembly sucks,"Huge pain to assemble. Tip: Use a hammer when it won't snap into place! Otherwise, it's a nice organizer, if you can get over the misery of putting it together."
2,Hard assembly and the wheels broke off 5 minutes later,"We got this at our baby shower. The thing was difficult to put together. Some pieces would just snap in there no problem, others would take some serious muscle power. Some of the pieces were warped. Once we got it together, we put everything we wanted in it and were very happy with it. we started wheeling it into the nursery and the wheels broke off. They only have a small tab holding them into place. we pulled off all the wheels and put it up against a wall. Don't buy it, it's not worth your time. If you already have it, it's a decent organizer just be prpared for the wheels to break."
2,A great concept...,I bought this for my second baby in October. It has already come apart. I agree with the other reviews that it is difficult to put together. It is also doesn't stay together once you actual put it together. The concept is great but the manufacturer needs to find a way to make your efforts worth their while.
1,The Organzier From Hell !!!,"I had the bad luck of putting this together for a good freind of mine. It was the worst experience of my life, the directions don't make sense and you have to be Arnold Schwazenegger to wrestle with the parts. Do yourself a favor don't give this to anyone you want to stay friends with."
2,bad assembling directions,"if you put it together right, the cart is quite useful. my husband said the directions were a pain and made the project harder than it really was. he put the one shelf upside down by the time he was finished. also, if you dont read ahead, you'll have the pieces switched. if the directions were easier to follow, the cart would have been put together in no time."
2,Good Idea Gone Bad,"An affordable, compact organizer cart is exactly what I had in mind when I added this to my registry. However, the cons outweighed the pros with this cart. As mentioned in previous reviews, the time and strength needed to assemble this cart is ridiculous. The center of the cart is not strong, so everything slides to the middle. The wheels are impossible to get on. Just when you think they are on, they fall off once you move it. The plastic is very weak. If you are considering this cart, please keep in mind, you will get what you pay for."
3,Great Storage.. a pain to assemble,"I registered for this prodcut after looking at it fully assembled in the store. Once it is fully assembled, it is great for extra storage. However, putting the cart together was a royal pain in the ... . I tried first (at nine months pregnant) and got totally frustrated. I am not a wimp, but the ammount of strength required to aseemble this was incredible. When my husband, who is a very strong guy, finally took pity on me and offered to assmeble it I thought he was going to throw it away in frustration. He actually worked up a sweat putting the cart together. Now that it is together, it is great, but for people who hate to assemble things, this is not the product for you."
1,Don't buy this thing!,"I wanted to save some money buying this thing, but it is not worth it. First of all, it is VERY hard to assemble; the thing is now falling in pieces, and if you see it it doesn't have a lot of space for storage. The racks fell when I placed the small baby lotions, shampoo, etc. I didn't like it at all."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!,"Living in a small home, we thought this would be so practical and convenient. BOY WERE WE WRONG!! First of all, it took forever to put together. The plastic it extremely flimsy. (When you put a bottle of baby lotion on the top shelf, it bends under the weight!)Furthermore, the wheels came off constantly. Two of them broke of just from being moved across the floor.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A DIFFERENT ORGANIZER!!!!"
2,Don't buy this,"I got this as a gift and it was horrible for my husband to put together. Then, the wheels all snapped off one by one everytime I'd move it. I use it now without the wheels on, but the sides come apart frequently!"
5,Great Nursery cart,"Before I registered for this cart, I read some of the reviews and registered for it regardless of some of the bad stuff people said about it. I think some of the people that bought or received it and said that it isn't sturdy are probably not using this cart as intended. I have had mine for over six months now, and I LOVE IT! I put diapers, wipes and some of her baby clothes in it, and the hamper is a plus. I only wish that I had gotten one of these with my first child. It's a great buy....I did have sore fingers when I was done putting it together, but it was worth it. And it IS sturdy."
2,Not a good product!!,I purchased this product for my nursery and was not pleased. It is not easy to put together. Mine broke while I was trying to assemble it. The parts are [flimsy] and overall it's a waste of money.
2,Difficult to assemble!,"We bought this cart last night for use in our baby's room. It took at least 90 minutes to put together. The instructions are horrible and we broke 2 pieces! Once you get the pieces together, you can't get them apart without them breaking. I do love the laundry hamper part of the cart and I will use the cart to store diaper changing supplies. But you need alot of patience to put it together!"
2,Painful to assemble,It is difficult to fathom how incredibly painful it is to put this thing together - One would imagine it would be the most simple thing. This is a great example of how to make something this simple the most irritating thing to assemble -My well meaning friend got this for the baby shower as we had it on our registry - How I wish I had never put this on
2,"A pain to assemble, a blessing to have!","I was told to get this from my friend who had her son before mine. She said it was the best product to have. I got it and sure enough it is great. One downfall though....it's a PAIN to put together. Those who say it's easy, ha ha, can I come over for a lesson next time?!? We ended up breaking PARTS, but it's still usable. I love having it....very convenient, but I would not assemble one again!!! Awful! It took us forever...5 stars for convenience, 2 stars for durability and so on...No the cart is not 14 in. high...like someone asked...if you don't own one, why make a review?!?!?!?"
2,Lasted less than 2 months!,I put this organizer in my registry so that i didn't have to put everything in the baby's dresser.I now find it to be a waste of [money]!It's been 2 months since my husband put this thing together and the shelves are starting to buckle.I had to write this review just to warn anyone who wanted to purchase this product against buying it.I have to constantly put the shelves back in place and I don't even have that many things inside of the organizer.
3,Helpful after all the cuts!!,"I was excited to put this together, considering I wasn't able to really do much during my pregnancy. But once I started putting this together, I must have said ""I'm taking this back"" at least a dozen times. Everytime you put on a piece, another comes off. I got cuts, & bruises all over my hands. But once it was all together it is very helpful & it holds tons of stuff. My husband, & I have a small apartment & really can't put any big furniture in our bedroom. Plus, we wanted something that could move around with ease. For the price you can't really complain to much. I am satisfied, NOW that it is put together. It is sturdy, & it doesn't look like it will fall apart. Patience is the key to this product. Overall, I'm satisfied!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Babies R Us should STOP selling this item. I read the reviews before I bought it, but still purchased it and I'm kicking myself for it now. Not only is it horrible to put together it's not worth the 20 dollar price tag. It looks easier than what it really is, it's very deceiving. A few days after my husband and I put it together it never seemed to stand properly. We just put it against my son's wall and put some blankets in it. It took up space for nothing. I would warn any parent against wasting their money."
1,What a waste!,"What a waste of time and money. I usually read all of the reviews on this website before purchasing a product, but this looked so simple and basic that I didn't think I needed to. What a mistake. The cart is almost impossible to assemble correctly because the pieces simply do not fit together like they should. We ended up having to bang them into place with a shoe and broke the corners off two sides as a result. Now that the cart is assembled I hope we will get a lot of use from it, but if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this product, I would buy the regular old Yaffa blocks!"
1,piece of junk,"This product is a piece of junk. I thought I would like it when I added it to my registry,but was quite displeased with the amount of effort it took to try to assemble it. It was very flimsy and tedious to try to put together. My husband even expressed a few swear words. Well, we packed it back up. We didn't bother to try to finish it. We returned it and got something else off of our registry. I highly DO NOT reccommend this product."
4,GREAT!,I was not if I really needed this or not but I got it anyhow and I'm so glad I did. It fits nicely in my babies closet and I can use it for those extra's and not fill up the space in the dresser or changing table. I admit it was a bit of a pain to put together but I really like all the extra room and the hamper to keep babies clothes seprate from my other childrens. I think it is a must have.
1,Do not waster your time,"When I went and registered for this cart, the display was pre built and looked very sturdy for the price. I received 2 for my shower and decided to keep both. I have put together many different types of plastic carts before and was not worried about this one. Well the day after my shower, we decided to start with the organizer. The directions were ok but a little confusing at first. It took 1.5 hours to assembly and the small tabs began breaking without any real force. The separator shelves never laid right and 1 wheel broke off prior to finishing all four. The idea is great but the time and effort it took to put it together and the quality; made us decide to return the 2nd cart. What a disappointment!!!!!"
2,Very difficult,"Putting this thing together was an absolute nightmare. It took hours! Once it was finished, I liked it, but it really isn't worth all of the hassel involved."
1,piece of junk,"we bought this thing thinking it would be great. We put it together, and as soon as we put the wheels on one broke off. Had the thing for about 3 weeks now, and all four wheels are now broke off. What a waste of money. $20.00 down the drain.aslo very frustrated to put together. Made very poorly.DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,Time consuming to assemble,"I read reviews for almost everything --- wish I would have read one for this product. I completely agree with the review of time consuming (glad I'm not the only one who took 3 1/2 hours to assemble!)My fingers are so sore from trying to snap together - I have given up for now. Maybe my husband will finish it....hurts to much.Hopefully, it will be worth it in the end and make a great organizer. But had I know before now I would have spent the money on ANY other kind of organizer."
1,Terribly Frustrating,"We bought this because we thought it would be helpful to have an organizer for the baby stuff and it was inexpensive. We also thought we would be able to use it in the garage when we no longer needed it in the baby's room. The only thing we didn't count on was how difficult it would be to put together. My husband got terribly frustrated with it. It took quite some time to put together because it doesn't have very good instructions and the pieces don't fit together very easily. Our lid broke while the wheels were being put on the bottom. Once it's put together, you pretty much have to take it apart to change anything which is a complete waste of time, not to mention you chance breaking something in the process. The only good thing is that it is a nice little organizer, although small. While it is nice now that it's put together, we definitely would not have bought it if we knew how difficult it would be to put together in the first place."
2,hard to put together- wheels wouldn't stay on,"I bought this a while ago for my son. It took me a long time to put together and I had put together a crib, swing, highchair, etc. all by myself so it's not like I am incapable of following instructions. The wheels wouldn't stay on mine because I snapped a piece off when putting it together lol. So we used it wheelless for about nine months- it was nice storage place even though I couldn't get the shelves to lay completely straight. I ended up just throwing it away."
2,ouch!,It took longer to put this together then the crib! The instructions are vague and confusing. Heaven forbid you put a piece the wrong way. You have to practically break it apart to fix it. I hope that it will at least serve its purpose when my baby gets here.
2,Frustrated Fingers,This product was one of the hardest items that I have ever put together. My thumb had two large pieces of skin removed from just putting on the wheels. I was glad to read the other reviews to know that I am not an idiot! It will serve its purpose but its not the best quality product.
3,Practically impossible to assemble,"The amount of force needed to put this together is incredible! A couple of tabs snapped off, and we will have to use crazy glue or something to make sure it stay stable. Good thing I wasn't going to put anything too heavy in it. The lid doesn't close fully either. The size is good, and I think it will be useful, and there doesn't seem to be a competing product, so I'm giving it a few stars, but whoever designed it should be smacked with a rolled up newspaper."
1,Not worth the hassle!!!!,"Originally I thought this would be a great product to roll around bath and diapering supplies from room to room. I bought it and left it in the box. Now that I'm closer to my due date, I took it out to assemble and was instantly frustrated. The pieces are so hard to ""click"" into place and if you mess up then it's almost impossible to take it apart without breaking it. I only put one cube together and decided to return it...definately not worth the hassle. There's got to be a better quality cart out there and I intend to find it...even if I have to pay more."
2,Not worth the money,"Well thats what I think anyway. I got this at my babyshower, they had put it together for me so I dont know how hard that is. The weight limit is 50lbs, but I didnt have anything on it and wheeled it to the bathroom and some wheels broke off. As long as it doesnt fall apart it would be a nice item to have, but this one is going back."
4,Instrutions Stink,I agree with the others on the instructions. The instrutions could have been better. Besides that we love it. Have patients putting it together and you will love it. It has made organizing the nursey much easier.
4,Great Product,"I do not know how useful this product will be since I do not have my babies yet. However, I have an advice, if you have trouble fitting parts together - you can GENTLY tap them with a hammer and it makes them snap in place really easy. It took me 30-40 min. to assemble the whole thing and I am 37 weeks pregnant with twins.Update: This is one of the most useful things in the nursery. I use it daily and push it all over the house and nothing on it is broken as of yet (3mos)"
1,Waste of money and time!!!,"I registered for this and recieved it at my baby shower, even after I read the poor reviews on it. My husband and I set it up together when I was 8 months pregnant, and we never got it fully assembled because one of the pieces that connects the top shelf to the bottom shelf snapped off and broke, and the wheels kept falling off. It's also not very sturdy at all, and it kept collapsing. I found a nursery cart for the same price at Babies R Us, you can't buy it off the internet though, but it's way better. It's made by HOMZ, and it's made out of wood and canvas. It's easy to assemble, and it's sturdy. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this product, though."
2,hard to set up.,"I'm 7 months along, and I am following the directions and still not done setting it up and I have been working on it for 3 hours. The farther I got the harder it has gotten to put together. While trying to attach the top and bottom together...........3 tabs are now broken. The box says no tools required......well I have been using the end of a screw driver to bang the panels together because I my hands hurt and I have cuts on my hands from trying to put it together without the screwdriver. Im going to let my hubby finish when he gets home from work. We need the extra space...........thats why we bought it. At this point I have sweared so much that I wish we hadnt bought it."
2,Difficult to put together!!,"I ignored some of the reviews myself as the looks of this stacker was what I was looking for. My daughter is 2 1/2 and going to start potty training soon and too big for the changing table now, but I still wanted somewhere to put diapers. Well, let me tell you....about an hour and a half later, my back thrown out and my hands about to bleed from pushing plastic pieces together...I would recommend getting something easier to put together, or already put together."
2,hard to put together,directions are confusing and it is hard to put together and if you make a mistake its hard to correct without breaking. its helpful in storing baby items though.
1,Needs Improvement,"I received the Nursery Organizer Cart as a shower gift. While it is great for storing things, I find that it is highly unstable. The wheels keep falling off. There are many times when I come in the baby's room only to find this thing toppled over on the floor. I intend on contacting the company and advising them of what a flimsy product they are selling."
4,"Nice looking, but hard to put together","I bought one yesterday and was very excited because I wanted to get one before my due date (11/22/01). Got home, opened the box and was shocked to see too many pieces, but still very excited to put it together. Well, I got really frustated when I started assembling it, some wouldn't fit in the slots. It took a long time just to assemble the first few panels. I really think this product looks very nice and an easy way to organize just about any stuff. Just need patience and a lot of free time to put together."
1,A nightmare to assemble! Just Awful!,"I struggled for a few hours to get this together - reading the directions carefully... I made very little progress as the pieces did not fit together well at all. Finally, I gave up and decided to return it. I am very dissapointed because I thought this thing would be great for the baby's room. Also, not only do you NOT get reimbursed for shipping, but you have to pay to send it back! They should offer a pre-assembled version for sale."
3,"Hard to put together, but very useful!","I found this cart very hard to put together. You need a lot of strength to push the parts together. I found the directions somewhat dificult to follow and some of it was unclear.Even though this item was difficult to assemble, I have found this item to be very useful. I use it in my living room so I dont have to walk all the way to my daughters room to change her diaper. Now all the items I need are right at hand. Plus I use the basket to put her living rooms toys in while I clean or just to pick them up and put somewhere at the end of the day. In the other shelfs I put blankets so they are not spread all around the room.I really live the convience of having the things I need close and organized, but I wish it came preassembled!"
3,HARD ASSEMBLY!!!!,This cart was a BEAR to put together! It was so hard to snap the sides together that my dear sweet hubby had to do it. You have to put so much pressure to get the peices together and it feels like you are going to break the little plastic parts. I must say once it is assembled it is very nice for organizing things.
2,"Great concept, but ......","This cart caught my eye because I thought it would be great for organizing some baby essentials in our small condo, however the hassle of trying to put it together and the quality of this item leave alot to be desired. I initially set out to put it together myself, after struggling for a 1/2 hour with 3 of the pieces I handed the task to my husband. He looked over the long and inadequate directions and proceeded to get it together over the next two hours. We were missing the lid it says it comes with, I have to call the manufacturer to get one sent to us. The cart ended up minus the shelves because they were to hard to put in after the whole thing was precariuosly together, and I do mean precarious because as you will find out if you to purchase this item you get one piece good only to have it come undone when you attempt to attach another. I advise all to think hard before wasting 20.00 on this item, and look for organization of some other kind."
2,Not as nice as it seems,"When i had purchased the organizer, i thought of the necessity that i might have. First, Putting the cart together was very difficult. With an infant time is very precious. Once it was together, it did do the job, after about 2 months two wheels had broken off. I had tried to glue on the wheels, but no good. eventualy I had to throw it out. I guess, for the price and for the 2 months of usage, it was worth it. But, I would not recomend this item to anyone."
1,You get what you pay for!!!!,"This was the most difficult piece to put together. Several of the pieces broke off during assembly, so I exchanged it for a new one thinking it was a fluke. My boyfriend was designated to put the next one together, and he had the same problems; pieces were very hard to put together and would snap off (directions were also lousy). We ended up returning that one also, deciding that milk crates from the grocery store would be just as handy and cute with our own touch ups."
5,EASY ASSEMBLY,"I had read all the negative reviews of this product, but I decided to buy it anyway & I'm glad I did. I figured if I didn't like it or really was too difficult to put together, then I would just return it. I am 8 1/2 months pregnant & I was able to put it together in 1/2 hour. When it came time to snap the top & bottom sections together, I ended up breaking the little tabs, but it was my fault for pushing & forcing it together too hard. I went back to Babies 'r Us the next day & exchanged it for a new one (They had no problem taking it back). When I got home, I put it together again & this time it only took about 20 minutes (without breaking it)! I stocked the organizer with diapers, wipes, blankets, etc. I think this organizer is wonderful, not to mention simple to put together with no cut-up or swollen fingers!!"
1,Buy milk crates,"I bought this today, I should have listen to everyone else, but I had to learn from my mistakes. My husband can build or put togehter anything, but this is awful, the directions do not work. THe plastic pieces break off. Honestly the only thing different from this and buying 4 milk crates is that milk crates are cheaper and sturdier, but it just doesn't come with wheels. PLEASE DO NOT BUY"
1,Extremely difficult to put together,"This item was very difficult to put together. The directions were very clear and easy to follow, however it was very difficult to snap the parts together. My husband ended up breaking one of the parts while trying to snap it into place. It was a very frustrating process and we ended up returning the product for a refund."
3,argh!!!!,"My hands are sore today after all the blood sweat and tears it took to put this thing together. Once it is assembled it is great, but it is SOOO hard to click the pieces together! Out of all the things we had to assemble for our baby, this was DEFINATELY the hardest!!! After an hour of stuggle my husband came home and rescued me! It even took him a little while with a few gadgets to try to click things in place! It is finally assembled now, and great for organizing... but it was quite an experience to get it that way!"
3,flimsy but very helpful,"I read some of the reviews on here and decided to write one as a result of some of them. I agree that you get what you pay for with this item. I was pretty excited about getting this but it was pretty difficult to put together. Once I got it together, it really did help with what I needed especially since I didn't have very much space. It has held up for almost 2 years now but it was very flimsy for most of the time. I had to tie some pieces together so they wouldn't fall apart. Someone recommended another product by HOMZ but just so you know, the product is made by this same company from what I can tell so if you're not wanting to deal with them, don't buy another one of their products. Overall, for the money I spent on this, it was worth it but if I had more money, I'd buy something more sturdy."
2,Difficult to put together!!!,This item took my father and I a couple of hours to put it together. It is a nice organizer for all of those little things you need on hand. But for all of the trouble it caused there are other organizers on the market that are much easier to put together.
3,Nice concept,"I found the product to be very hard to put together, (the pieces were a bit difficult to clamp and stay together and I actually broke a piece off the lid). In theory however, it is a practical addition to a nursery I would buy another or give one as a gift, but more thought needs to go into making the assembly of the product easier."
1,How Frustrating!!!,I don't even want the darn thing anymore after trying to put it together. The directions were clear but the pieces didn't go together like they should have. I had to use a shoe to put some in place and I even snapped 2 small plastic pieces off the thing. I am SO frustrated now that I don't even want to use the thing. Do not recommend!
1,Frustrating!!,"I normally like putting things together. It's not hard to figure out how pieces go together, but the actual fitting is extremely frustrating. The pretty front panel has very fragil tabs. You better wear gloves when assemble this because your hands will end up quite red. Putting the top and the bottom part together is really a two people job. For me, it has been a total body work out."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I registered for this item and thought it was a great idea for the nursery. Well, two days later after trying to put it together I'm sore, exhausted and broke my nails! I'm 33 weeks pg and it was hard to assemble this item. The pieces don't all snap in so easy, like they claim and once you get one in, the other side falls apart. Putting the top and bottom together was a maddening chore. It's finally done and looks good but I am afraid to move it in fear it will collapse on me. Don't waste your money or time. It's not worth it for this item."
1,this thing stinks,"as with all the other reviews,i have to agree that it is not worth the time or money.my boyfriend and i both tried to get this thing together and all we ended up with was sore fingers and a handful of curse words...we're taking it back tomorrow...don't waste your time!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money or time!,"Difficult to put together and following the directions give incorrect results. Aside from being cheap looking, it's cheap quality. You get what you pay for this cheap piece is just that ... CHEAP! If there where an option for 0 stars, I would have chosen that. However, I resorted to the lowest 1 star."
2,Not what I expected!!!,"I looked at this item online and thought ""what a great item to put diapers and other little stuff"", well it serves the purpose. It was not easy to put together at all. I am now 9 months pregnant, very aggrevated and have sore fingers from putting something together that looked simple but was deceiving. As soon as I wheeled it against the wall, all 6 wheels fell off. And they were put on just as the instructions said. Also, the instructions could have been clearer with the diagrams. I would not give this to anyone as a gift, I would feel horrible. And I must mention that my [local store] was sold out of it and not expecting it for a while, I traveled to NJ to purchase this item. Wasted time, Gas , and money. VERY DISSAPPOINTED!"
2,Wheels broke- Nice Storage though,I read the reviews on this cart but still bought it. Should of kept looking for something a bit stronger and maybe cost a little bit more. I put it together myself and thought as long as you read hte instructions clearly it wasn't hard to put together but for some reason my shelves are a little crooked- so I must of done something wrong. Then when I was putting on the wheels the little tabs that hold htem in place busted on two of them so I had to take all the wheels off- which I didn't like at all because the mobility of it was one of the main reasons I wanted it. The one thing I like best is it is extra storage and I really like the hamper!!
2,Time Consuming,"I agree with Roseann from Pennsylvania. I received this as a gift, for my babyshower. My son is 1 years old and it is still in the box. I tried to put it together and pinched my hand. I would not buy this as a gift for any of my friends to assemble on their own."
4,Wonderful storage unit,"I was cautious at first to buy this item. I was concerned over some other comments about it's difficulty to put it together. However, I purchased it anyway (needed the storage) and it took me about 45 min to assemble. Wasn't difficult if you followed directions. Only required some manpower from my husband to help snap pieces together. We have limited space in our apartment and this unit comes in very hand for crib sheets and extra blankets as well as a hamper in the top compartment."
4,Tricky to put together.,"I did not buy a regular changing table, instead I have dress with the changing pad on it. Because I did not but the normal table, I did not have any storage. I found this cart and liked it a lot. It was a little tricking putting together, and the shelves slip if you move it, but other than that it works really well. There is a lot of storage, and it has a built in hamper so you don't have to have a seperate one."
2,what is the total height of the cart?,"Is it 14 inches high, or is each box 14 inches high and 12 inches wide? Because if the actual hieght is fourteen inches how could it be of any help?"
2,Difficult Item,"I purchased this item just yesterday and read the packaging which stated ""Easy to snap and put together"" My husband and I who assembled our crib, dresser and changing table within less than hour took almost 2 hours putting this thing together! We finally got it assembled and pushed it (while it was empty) over to the closet and the wheels broke off. I can only imagine what else would have fell apart if we had put our items in it. We removed the wheels completely and now it is sitting in the closet, I'm debating whether to trust it enough to put items I wanted into it, or return it. I think for being a nothing more than 4 plastic bins, it should have not been as difficult as it was."
1,Stunningly Awful!!!,"Do your friends a favor, if they are having a babyshower as my wife and I did, don't be cruel and buy them this. It is far to difficult to assembl, my wife certainly couldn't do it, and it was tough enough for me. The only reason I finished it was because I refused to be defeated by it. The finished product also looks terrible. The ONLY time I would recommend this is perhaps for a baby shower at work for a co-worker you don't like. Other than that it's great!"
2,Need assistance with assembly!!!!,"The directions are awful and by the time you figure out how to put this together, you discover it is impossible to do so. It requires so much strength to assemble, it seems like it will break. If you are not very strong or have a strong assistant, don't even bother buying this one.Once together, a good organizer though, so it gets 2 stars as a redeeming value."
4,"After an hour, it was worth it","I must say that I bought the nursery organizer cart and it took me over an hour to try and put it together, I got so mad that I was going to bring it back. I guess patience kept me from doing that. Anyway it is very strong and all of the necessary essentials like pampers, wipes, etc. are better organized."
1,Ugh! Bad bad bad item.,I am due to have my second child in a few weeks so I am no newbie to baby-purchases. This cart is TERRIBLE!I am typing this with a pulled arm muscle right now because that is how hard you have to push to snap the pieces together. My husband just helped and low and behold... we pushed a piece in place and part snapped off! Grrr....It looks really cute on the box but it was not worth the time. I'll invest in some storage drawers instead.
1,never again,"I bought this item for my grandson, thinking everything would look good in it and space saver. WELL just try to put this thing together, I don't think so...Three people tryed, 2 men and 1 woman. My son is so very handy with his hands said to me "" Mom throw this thing in the garbage "" And I did. Now my daughters girlfriend wants this item. And I just rembered ( i was going to buy it and fill it up ) NOTTyler's Grandma"
1,Not worth the aggravation,I registered for this items because I wanted my baby's clothes to be organized and out of the way. This shelf is difficult to assemble and broke within the first hour we had it out of the box. The wheels fell off after I had put one shelf of clothes into it. The only reason I didn't return it is because it would have been a further aggravation to bring it back to the store once it was assembled. Don't waster your money.
2,nice but annoying to put together,"I like this organizer. It is well designed, BUT, what a pain to assemble!!!I followed the instructions word per word and I had to redo the entire thing twice. Even now, it has some pieces inside out but i am not going to re-do it AGAIN."
5,A truly artistic piece of work.,"I had a cassette tape of this work for years and all that time I thought it was actually Abba. This is one of those rare occurrences where an original product is expanded upon by another artist and an even better product is produced. Not to diminish Abba's work, but I much prefer extended versions.These guys took some already great songs and elaborated on them so that there is actually a train of thought unlike most radio versions of todays pop songs that last only 3-4 minutes. Most of the versions on this album run 6-8 minutes. The many added touches do not dectract in any way to the original songs. Highly Recommended!"
5,A new way of looking at an old book,"This is essential reading for anyone interested on the bible. It is written from an anthropoligical point of view by one of the greatest anthropologists of our era. There is no claim here to biblical scholarship in its narrow sense. But the Book of Leviticus is shown to be much more than a boring list of sacrificial and purity rituals. The detailed poetic and thematic structures are described both as explanations of what the book is about religiously as well as from a literary point of view. This combination is really engaging. Although some of the associations and structures are forced and general rules are derived from single cases, although frankly I think she gets some things wrong, I have not been so stimulated by a book on the bible for a very long time. Even for someone totally familiar with traditional commentaries this will be an exciting read."
5,Meanings within meanings,"One of my great passions is the study of inner meanings of symbols and how they connect to an ancient line of wisdom that tells us all who we are. In particular the connections in myths, chants, and now religions. Mary Douglas's book has opened many new doors that reflect this connection in what I refer to as the ancient line of wisdom or knowledge. Her reflections on the structure of Leviticus reveal important messages of the ancient past that are critical for survival today. I love the book as well as her ""In the Wilderness"". Aloha nui, Pohaikawahine"
2,cracked after 2 months use,bought this cover for my girlfriend and the bottom piece cracked after just a couple of months
4,Pretty Solid,"Don't feed the troll folks... anyway, this is a pretty solid CD. I get the feeling that WSP wanted to release something different from their previous amazing live release, Light Fuse Get Away. So, they're releasing a recording of them playing with the DDBB. Certainly a big departure from LFGA, which I would call mostly high-energy pyrotechnics that are a good sampler of WSP's songs. As a result, the album is pretty solid, but not as smoothed out as the other live album. I liked most of it pretty well, although for some reason Beehive Jam I just find irritating. It gets too atonal, then jumps off-pace and drags drags drags. Maybe on repeated listens... still a good album for fans of the group, not what I would start with though...I'd recommend Til The Medicine Takes if you like studio stuff more, Light Fuse Get Away if you're a live person."
5,it is a joyous occasion,"wsp and ddbb have put together a masterpiece here for fellow spreadheads and non sreadheads alike songs like guilded splinters,coconuts and christmas katie make this album one of the best i have heard in years. the remake of supersition i was lucky to see live and it has lost nothing in the transition from live to cd thanks boys this is top notch."
2,"Silicone is an improvement, but....","I received a set of these with my new KitchenAid mixer (which I love), but I don't really care for them. The scraper head has a stiff, plasticky feel, which makes it harder to scrape out a jar. It also doesn't clean well in the dishwasher -- I don't think it is 100% silicone. The big handles remind me of a car's hood ornament. They take up too much space in the drawer, and the slight increase in comfort doesn't outweigh their other flaws. I just put my set in the pile for our local recycling center's swap shop. I much prefer the Chef'n double ended spatulas, which are all silicone with an internal metal handle, come in great colors, clean well in the dishwasher, and take up far less drawer space."
3,THESE ARE NOT MAXELL despite the title!!!,"These batteries ARE fresh and work well, they just aren't Maxell like it says under the title!hobbytoolsupply sells the same 20 batteries that says ""by Tian Qiu"" under the title for $2.41, which is an even better buy AND you're getting what they're advertising instead of a switch. Other than that, I'm very pleased with hobbytoolsupply!"
2,Batteries seems to be too weak,"The batteries seems to be too weak, did not power the tire gauge that I bought for."
4,"no leaks or rust, they look brand new and shiny.","i don't recognize the chinese brand, but the first three batteries worked fine in my kid's toy flashlight/noisemaker device.i was concerned about safety -- chinese batteries being known to explode, etc -- but these batteries are in fine condition so far -- no leaks or rust, they look brand new and shiny."
4,Fine!,"Hey for the price, who can complain? Might not be quite as strong as the name brands, but for the price they work great!"
3,batteries,"What can I say, they are batteries that don't cost much. Service is excellent and the shipping was very fast, even during the holidays."
5,Alternative heavy rock - way before its time!,"This band was from the same pool that gave us Jane's Addiction, and you can definitely pick up some of that same vibe except with better vocals. The band rocks throughout- with anthemic tracks such as Love and Revolution, The Bike, and especially the ""get your lighters out"" Awaking Slowly in November. For anyone who loves the Cult, Jane's and even heavier U2 stuff- this is the band for you. Although this is a fantastic live album with an incredible performance, it's a shame there's no studio CDs avialable for this awesome band."
2,Not that great...,I Couldnt even get it to work! I plugged in my modem ethernet cord. It said it had connectivity. I hooked up a plug from the back of the Switch to my computer. Worked. Took another ethernet from the switch and put it in another computet. Did not work. It seems this little thing cant change IP's. So i could only get one computer hooked up to it because computers dont allow 2 computers in the entire world to have the same IP as another computer.
1,Rubbish,"It is interesting to note that we live in a society that sees the epitome of evil in the destruction of 6,000,000 Jews by Hitler, while we pay no attention whatsoever to the destruction of 7,000,000 Ukrainians by Stalin. So of course Dworkin compared the abuse of women to the Jews and not to the Ukrainians. Dworkin is Jewish, so one would expect the Jewish comparison, but still, I personally am sick of hearing every evil person compared to Hitler and not to Stalin. So now she tells us that all men, men as such, are Nazis. Ho-hum, yawn. Please pass the butter. This thing about women being, so to speak, the chosen gender (cf. the chosen race), is too silly for words. She suggests that women should go off and form a nation by themselves, and have nothing more to do with men. Oh, really? And just how is the human race to continue to exist under such conditions? Where are the children supposed to come from? Did she even stop to think about this? Did she even care?"
3,Her Kampf,"Andrea Dworkin has been building to this book for quite some time and now, with Scapegoat, we finally get to see the depths of her dementia. Like Adolf Hitler, Ms. Dworkin scapegoats a hated group and blames everyone but herself for all the problems she has helped to perpetuate upon the world. There really isn't anything of value in this propagandist's nightmare, other than the fascinating use of Jews and Isreal to make her frightening point: Dworkin seems to think 'liberation' and 'seperation' are synonymous and essentially calls for a bloodbath to reason her private, petty delusions. I suspect the title of this book was almost the title of my review.I give Scapegoat three stars because Dworkin finally seems to come into her own here, stating her long running point more eloquently, and more lucidly kicking off her gender war."
2,Comely spatula fails the longevity test,"This supple, apparently strong, and, well, delectably comely, spatula, was a dream come true for me--- AT FIRST.I loved the feel and the action of this substantial spatula; what I objected to was the seemingly spontaneous LARGE CRACK which formed after six months sparing use of this tool. The blade was useless, so I threw it away -- with sadness (and irritation)."
4,A great introduction to language and culture,"Following the idea that language cannot be separated from the culture that speaks it, this book introduces children to some basic words and customs of the people who traditionally speak Swahili. Any child interested in foreign languages, or perhaps just the names in the Lion King (taken from Swahili, Simba=lion, Rafiki=friend)will appreciate this simple introduction to another language and culture. Older children may even be motivated to learn more on their own. I highly recommend it."

4,my opinion counts,George Barna's book is a must read for anyone who wants to know the spiritual health of our great nation. I highly recommend this book.
1,Misleading,"Barna's writing is awful and his statistics given are misleading. He spends a good deal of the book seperating Christians into groups and showing which group is ""best"" in his opinion. For Christians who haven't developed their own sense of scripture and the teachings of Christ, this book can be misleading and cause people to fall into judgment of other Christian groups. As a Catholic I found the book highly offensive because I know Barna counted me as a ""non-born-again Christian"" and that I fell into the bad Christian catagory, which I don't agree with. Christians should respect all other Christians no matter what their denomination, we should not be divided, we should be united.Barna owns a marketing and researching firm, he is not a biblical scholar, he's just trying to market HIS OWN misconceptions to you, which you don't need, SAVE YOUR MONEY, tith it to your church or a charity, don't waste it on this book."
3,The crisis of the Christian mind,"Here Barna makes the case that Christians, particularly evangelicals, do not live like we should because we do not THINK like we should -- i.e., like Christ. He says that we spend an hour a week in church learning a few verses and then spend the rest of the week letting the world tell us what and how to think.I believe he is pretty much spot on. Why, then, only three stars? Barna makes a great case for having a Christian worldview, and his concluding material on what it looks like to have one and how to build one in a congregation is great, but the major part of the book is his analysis of the seven great worldview questions, and his treatment of them was not that good. Not bad, but not that good.The first three and last three chapters are worth the purchase price of the book, but for a better look at worldviews and the Christian worldview, I recommend (as does the author) the work of James Sire and Harry Blamires."
5,Biblical Worldview 101,"I was surprised when reading this title, for it is so much different than Barna's other works. Rather than citing statistics and displaying pie charts of religious demographics, the author describes the importance of a Biblical worldview and the basics of it. For me his words here are refreshing, offering an insight into Barna's own heart and mind.Barna here is straightforward, easy-to-follow, and extremely relevant. I recommend this book highly to anyone wanting to understand the basics of what it means to have a Biblical worldview. In short, it means to ""Think Like Jesus!"""
5,"Quality Music, Excellent Performer","I just saw David in Boston. Not only does he sound as great in person as on the album, but he's a very genuine person. You can see how these beautiful songs came directly from his heart. He is passionate about his music and it shows. Worth every penny of your purchase and more...."
5,exellent product,This is the first GPS I have ever owned and I have to say that I am really glad that I got this. This is way more than I expected so far as accuaccy and funtions. The screen is also really sharpe.
4,The GPS for everybody doing everything,"I believe in ""worst part first"" - the Meridian GPS is a little slow on PC to GPS software downloads; but, that really isn't much of a problem as long as you don't wait until the last minute to prepare the unit. And that's all of the ""worst part"".The Meridian GPS comes as close to ""being all things to all people"" as I have ever seen. It is comfortable hiking, biking, driving, sailing or flying; while being used by anyone from a ""pro"" to a novice. Some reading and basic navigational ability is required (if you can get lost in a closet, this unit is not for you). Until GPS technology gets to ""telepathic operation"" you won't find a more user friendly, all purpose unit."
3,magellan meridian platnium,"I had complained about map conversion time. I now know it was a software conflict. After major problems, the times are now very speedy. However, my major complaint with this unit is the buttons. They aren't recessed. I have inadvertently turned off the unit and not noticed. It makes it hard to backtrack! I have had the screen settings change because of buttons being hit. You can't just put this unit in your pocket or fanny pack and go hiking. I have had problems with the compass on occasion. If you get a hard sided case it will help."
4,The Practical Wisdom of the Shamans of Ancient Mexico,"Being a great fan of Carlos Castaneda and the teachings of don Juan, I obviously enjoyed this book. I was intrigued to note the similarities between the physical exercises recommended by the Shamans of Ancient Mexico and those recommended by proponents of Yoga and the Martial Arts; people from widely disparate lineages, and yet all have discovered the power and benefit that can be derived from a very similar style of physical exercise and breathing technique.For me though, I would suggest that one should have read some of the other works of Carlos Castaneda before the power of this book can be fully appreciated."
4,Castenada tells how......,"Wondeful exposition from the master of consciousness training. Reminds me very much of Jesus' training under the tutelage of the yogis in Jagganath, India. In Richard G. Patton's wonderful ""THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" there is a passage very evocative of Castenada's Magical Passes and very much at variance with what we have been formerly taught. Curious that this unique information should become open to the general public from two such different sources?"
3,Castaneda is a tricky subject,"This book is basically another approach to the same things Tai Chi and Yoga have already been doing, and in fact the movements are essentially the same most of the time.Well, by now, we should all be aware that Carlos Castaneda is a creative individual who created his world of Don Juan and the Mexican Shamans himself, and not the esoteric initiate of any super sacred line. This doesnt make the practices he describes less valid. If his words speak to you in a way the other materials did not, then he has succeeded as an author. If he has opened your eyes to a wider world, he has done his job. His language is a fair amount more engaging and open than the more ""serious"" materials can be, so it is an excellent book for your spiritually minded High Schooler, or new age beginner."
5,It's a WORK-BOOK,"This book by Carlos Castaneda is different then those before (9). Older books one can simply ""read"", this is a *REAL* Work-Book, and in order to benefit from it, one must do the work, the magical passes. For those out of the arm-chair and wanting to navigate infinity there is a way(s), and the magical passes may take you there, or not. Sorcery is a solo flight/fight. Don't get this book for a quick read, remember, it's a WORK-BOOK, so get to work! ..... Paul"
5,A Must!,"This is the other side of ths Force of the American Cinema. I hope that one day people will see that movies in USA are much, much more than Hollywood. This is the real stream.Lázaro SoilvaTerceira, AzoresPortugal"
2,"Pretty cheaply made, indeed...","The whammy bar is probably the worst aspect of it. It rarely works unless you push down AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. I'm also not a fan of the frets. They're spread a lot further apart than the stock controller, they don't press down very far, and...the worst...they stick. The strum bar protrudes awkwardly far out, and there is a lag in star power activation. Basically, altogether, this thing sucks. I would recommend just buying Guitar Hero 3 with the new Les Paul controller at the end of this month. WHOOOOOOO!"
2,Just stick with the Official Redoctane one,"I have had many problems with this controller over the span of 2 1/2 of a month. The first thing to go wrong was the whammy bar. It would work on and off and stayed that way till I opened it up. Finally, when things started to took better for the controller, the whammy bar was finicky again and the Spring broke in it. So, I opened it up yet again and tried to solve the problem. It has yet to break again but this has been much of a pain in my thorn. For 5 dollars more, Redoctane gives you more bang for your buck!"
4,It works,I had to have someone else with the same guitar get it setup to work right but pleased with how well it works now
2,broke after 4 days of use,This thing sucks. i first got it on thursday and i played with it for a bit but on sunday the wammy bar broke and i had to return it. always get the name brand product. this is not name brand. look for red octane guitars.
3,Good for specific things,I bought blaster with teflon and tried it on my car doors. It dont think it worked as well as white lithium grease spray. I have found a great application for it. I think it work great for treadmill belts. You see you can't use wet oil on a treadmill but I will try this for the treadmill belt. I have yet to try it so I am not sure how it will work out.
4,Better than most razor blade scrapers,This scraper lets you reach places an ordinary hardware store scraper won't reach. Plus the longer handle gives you much better leverage. Another plus is the blade end does store within the handle with a lever that locks the blade end out of the way.
3,Jane's F/A-18,"I bought this game because so many people in virtual squadrons were transitioning to it from Graphic Simulations' ""F/A-18:Korea"". This is a very realistic simulator in terms of flight model, carrier ops, etc. The graphics of the outside world is superb. But I have one gripe-- I'm extremely disappointed in the graphics detail of the cockpit. Yes, it is a 3D cockpit, but other F/A-18 sims have done better on the rendering. And when I play the game, I'm constantly reminded of the fact as I fly the plane, as I don't use external views. (Real pilots don't use external views)"
1,DOES NOT WORK ON XP,"I was so excited after reading great reviews when I found that I had it, I popped it in and readied myself for action. After installing it, I opened it and it says that ""Janes FA-18 Simulator doesnt work on your operating system"" (Windows XP)Does anyone know how I can make it work?? I would greatly appreciate it."
5,it's the best simulation game i'v ever seen !!!,"i have lots of flight simulation games and from all of them, Jane's has the most fun and realistic games. F/A-18 is the best from all of them. It has the best graphics, features and it's fun. Not recommended for beginners, but if you like flight games - this is the right choice!"
4,All Around good game,Jane's F/A-18. A game that does most things right. Good graphics.... good sound... challanging... yet easily learned. If your interested in applying real world tactics in a game.. this is one that you can do that in.You will need however... at least a 600MHZ P3 or AMD Athlon proccessor to run this with 80%-90% of the graphics at the highest levels. It would also be advisible to have a GE Force2 graphics card or a ATI Raedon 7500.
4,great pulley,"heavy duty, and very smooth. I bought a pair of these to hang from my celing in the garage to hang weights from for doing lat pulldowns, triceps, etc. my only complaint is that it is hard to get the pin back into its hole after removing the wheel from the housing to put your rope or cable through. i ended up putting it in a vice to hold it together while i got the pin through, but that is the last time i will have to do that, so not really a problem for me."
3,Southbooth?,"Having used the Adobe products for some time now, I became familiar with Adobe Audition and fell in love with its capabilities and ease of use. When the Adobe CS3 suit came into play, I was dismayed that Audition was taken off the list a replaced with Sound booth.Sound booth I found is still a user friendly product, but more for the people who are only recording to one track and only recording. It is much easier to use that Audition so the rank amateur will be able to pick up how to use it fairly easily, but if you expect to do multi track recording and creating CDs, this is not the software for you. Instead look for Adobe Audition."
5,Classic Silver Band,I purchased 2 sizes of this ring. These items were exactly the way they were described. They even arrived sooner than the estimated delivery date. The rings were brightly polished with no marks. My husband and I are using them for our wedding rings.
2,why,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM JSUT 2 YEARS AGO THINKING IT WAS COOL HAVING E-MAIL AND THINGS BUT NO ONLY WELL MATH AND HTINGS LIKE THAT IT IS A VERY GOOD LAPTOP FOR LEARNING AND IF YOU WERE TO CHECK YOUR E-MAIL YOU WOULD HAVE TO HOOK THIS WIRE TO THE COMPUTER NO REASON JUST USE THE COMPUTER (...)
2,MEDIOCRE ADVICE,"This book, like several others in this genre, provides the reader with different nuances on how to brief cases, take lecture notes, study for exams and other components that every other book in this field suggests.This book is a rather long and difficult read. It contains a few decent suggestions on study aids, but one can receive this information from practically any other pre-law book or website.My suggestion is to stick to other pre-law books and not waste your money on this one.Upcoming 2L."
5,Excellent,"Really enjoyed the book. Not so much in the first year of law school when we were bombarded with everything, but reading it now was way better."
3,"In the end, everything worked out","This item did not arrive within the time window. However, when I emailed the seller, they said they did send it and there must have been a problem with shipment. They responded to my email within 2 or 3 days, and then send the same titled booklet which arrived within less than 1 week."
5,Fine Service,"An old program to run on my old computer. I have used it before, so there were no surprises. Well satisfied."
5,ValueRam PC133,Ordered to upgrade amount of memory. Quality memory chip that installed with no problems and worked as described in my desktop.
2,Ahhh..you could pass.,"This book actually gave me a bad dream. I had a dream that when I tried to get my money back from Amazon on this waste of a read, that they gave me the run around and I couldn't get my money back.Then again, my opinion could be based on the fact that I had a stomach virius and stuck in bed while I read this book. I got sick in Mexico.I do like Pierson's other books though."
3,Pretty good but...,"It was pretty good as a whole, and I liked the part of the fight on the ship but this style of book is more genarly for the Forgotten Realms series where half the story is descriptions on how everybody dies brutally. I liked what they did with kenders, though making them an actual race and not just nuisences brouight in sometimes for comic release. Kenders are my favorite race and I was somewhat disapointed at the way they were describing all the cruel things the Ogres were doing to the kenders. The positive things were that all in all the storyline was really good! The main characters were well done although it is a pity that they had to die. It also reveals more about kender than was known before, such as there weapons. I do recommend this book to someone who likes action and kender.(but not to much, cause it is depressing)"
5,This book is the best fantasy book on the market.,"This is by far the best and most exciting book in the Dragonlance series so far. I like it a lot because of all of the fighting. I strongly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys TSR books. I knew that Riverwind would die but I didn't think that Swiftraven, and Brightdawn would also die. Them dying makes the book more real and a little saddening."
5,A great Gene Hackman Series,"""The French Connection"", ""Hoosiers"" and ""Mississippi Burning"" are some of my favorite films with Gene Hackman, and I think this item was worth the money."
5,3 Great Movies at a Great Price,"I have always liked Gene Hackman's acting, and I really liked the powerful Mississippi Burning. A friend recommended Hoosiers as I coach. I remembered falling asleep to The French Connection years ago, but thought it was interesting up to the point I fell asleep. Great movies for a great price!"
1,Defective merchandise,"Received the Rumford indoor/outdoor coil hose with spray wand on April 22,2011. Today, 16 days later,as it was in use, the piece where it attaches to the faucet broke apart, sending water all over. I was lucky that I was using it outside. There is no way that I can repair it. Feel that it was money wasted. I had a similar product for 6-7 years before it gave out."
1,cheaply made,"I bought this for my husband to water his vegetable garden and it only lasted 4 months before the lever broke off of it. It worked well up until then..but, I wouldn't recommend it for outdoor use."
1,Watering wand...almost...a good one.,"For the most part all of the components are very good. However,the spindley hose falls way short for actual use. If the hosewere a larger diameter then this would be a good tool to have around."
1,unsatisfied,"maybe I got a ""lemon"",but this product needs some improvement. First,the thumb ""trigger"" broke.After I used some ingenuity, I was able to fix this by drilling a hole and inserting a metal bolt. Then the hose to faucet adapter would blow off the faucet when even a little water pressure was involved. This I solved by super gluing the plastic adapter together. It works now (for how long I don't know).So. unless you like to solve problems, I cannot recommend this product."
2,Indoor outdoor garden hose,"I debated & debated on purchasing this product, and I really wish I wouldn't have...it's just too much of a hassle to hook up!"
2,Seek elsewhere,"As someone else mentioned, the entire fixture is plastic, there's no metal (as depicted in the picture). Also, our main complaint is the hose diameter is so small that the flow is pretty slow, and so watering takes longer than we hoped. I'm going to keep looking for one with a larger diameter."
5,nice watch,"i just got this watch 3 days ago and i'm very happy with it. it looks and feels great, not too heavy not too light. it has chronograph and tachymeter, i just have to read the manual to understand how the second one works but in general im pretty happy with this watch. the only thing i have to say is that in the picture the dial looks kinda purple and that was one of the reasons i purchased the watch but now that i have it i can see the dial is gray-ish not purple. i guess the pic colors are kinda funny unless they sent me a different watch, anyway i like it (and ppl around me like it too) it's a good deal for $ 69.99... oh and it's swiss made, that's a very important thing for me when looking 4 a watch."
5,Great tool,"If you make cakes or other baked goods this is the tool you must have. The angle allows one to frost a cake very easily. You have a very professional looking cake when done frosting. It is a very attractive tool also ( mine is white) and well made. To some at [a moderate price] may seem expensive, but it will be in your kitchen for many years to come."
2,Ouch - I got brain cramps,"Wow.. where do I begin? The filming is high-school, first college project quality.... lots and lots of gaffes to pick out. The acting is about the same. There are some cute moments, but the overall effect felt like a Rocky Horror knock-off.... I am talking some serious camp here folks!!! The movie really has zero to do with bollywood.... anyway, nuff said. If you are gonna watch this film... my only advice is... take two tylenol first (tequila might work)! :)"
2,Just fluff,"I wasn't expecting much more than fluff because this was tagged a screwball comedy, but even those meager expectations were dashed when all I got was a ridiculous and totally implausible story line, lame dialog and sight gags, cruddy camerawork, strained performances (which, to be fair, were not the fault of the actors but of the material). Ugh. I watched it to the bitter end, though, hoping it might get better, but it didn't. It would almost get some momentum going and then...thud! The best I can say about it is that the actors portraying the three principals were endearing, and trying their hardest to make the best of a bad situation. I had never seen any of them in anything else, but if the bravura they summoned up for this pathetic vehicle is any indication, they were wasted here and deserve better. There were moments when I was cringing from embarrassment for them."
4,We Need More!!,"I Loved The Show, remember watching it when it was on TV, but never got around to watching them all. Watched The Whole Season In 3 Days, and want more... A Great Show That Fell Under The Radar"
4,Bring it back,"I suppose that Boomtown may have been in direct competition with The Shield, both are set in L.A., both have a mix of uniformed cops and detectives, unlike most cop shows which deal only with the plainclothes guys. Of the two I prefer the Shield but Boomtown was still miles better that both the CSI and Law and Order series and their spinoffs.Boomtown may have had little that was new about it, cops under investigation, cops with family problems,cops who hasd lost friends in the army. But it was well done and the stories for the most part rang true. OK Bobby Smith doing his best to be Bruce Willis in Die Hard was bit hard to take, but for the most part the action was believable.If you like cop shows this was was one of the best not as good as The Shield, The Wire or Hill Street Blues but up there withCagney and Lacey and NYPD Blue."
2,season 2,Well it looks like NBC screwed the fans of Boomtown again. So far the few remaining episodes from the short season 2 have not been released on dvd. Thank god I taped them when they aired.
5,One of the finest TV shows I've ever seen,"I'm a television writer myself and I'm completely humbled by the quality and complexity of this series. If there were any justice, it would have lasted more than one season, but I'm glad that a show this wonderful got a chance to air at all. I was very happy to see the show win a well-deserved Peabody Award but it deserved several Emmy's as well. It's great that it's out on DVD now so it can be preserved and discovered by people who never got a chance to see it originally. I'm grateful to Graham Yost and his brilliant co-writers, directors, actors, and crew for work that will always be an inspiration to me."
5,If we were judged by our viewing habits,"Simple TV is good and ample. Intelligent TV is astounding, thought provoking, humbling, and rare.Boomtown was a wonderfully crafted show that demanded your attention from beginning to end. After reading a few reviews, I think we all agree that the acting was astounding, the writing and plots were thought provoking, and the direction and production was humbling.If you love TV that makes you despise the interruption of commercials, makes you hang on every word in every scene, and stare dumbly at the screen when credits roll, Boomtown is the show for you.I hope when the next `Boomtown' TV show surfaces, that we as a viewing audience, are up to the challenge of being entertained by such a brilliantly rare crafted gem."
5,Boomtown/Season 1,"I knew this show would be cancelled because I loved it. As in life-for-real, everyone has a different ""take"" on the same situation. That is exactly what this seemingly too-smart-for-the-general-viewing-audience was about. It showed you just how different views occur and how they impact individuals and those around them. Though I've yet to view the discs yet I am sure I will enjoy seeing the episodes again. Shipping took awhile, but was w/i the alloted time. Me happy!"
5,It's a Shame...,"It's a shame that this show was canceled after just one season, it was so well made, and very unique. I love Boomtown!"
4,Good,Just like everything I buy from Amazon if its used and the description says Good condition it might as well be new. I love it!
5,Can I have more stars?,"Seriously, there is so much mindless drivel on tv that this series should NEVER have been cancelled! Well acted (personally I believe that Donnie Wahlberg is as good as his brother, he just doesn't get the big roles), well directed, neat camera angels. Just all around good.I'm looking into downloading the few episodes from the doomed season 2.This series is well worth the money and multiple viewings."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I purchased this book as a gift for my grandmother who was born and raised in a small town in Alabama. Based on the cover of this book, I had assumed that the pictures would be of charming and pretty subjects in towns like the one my grandmother was raised in. Instead, the pictures show the decay that is present in many small and for that matter, large towns today. I was disappointed and would not recommend this book to anyone interested in a nostalgic trip down memory lane. I found the pictures to be rather depressing."
3,SAY YES,"I enjoyed this movie, because I had the chance to watch a small portion of it being filmed, and had very small part in the background. Actually I enjoyed the story too."
3,Barefoot Doctor's Manual,"There is a lot of plant information in this book, with concise drawings, however it is a small book, so it is not easy to see the drawings. Also, I thought there would be more practical first-aid type information. It would be helpful IN ADDITION to other first aid books, but on its own not very helpful."
5,This works well!,"I've used NaturVet Ultimate Skin & Coat Supplement for a couple of years. I have two cats, one of whom had a bad matting / knotting problem; the other a hairball problem. The matting problem has completely gone away, and the hairballs have decreased substantially. But the most rewarding thing is the exceptional softness of their coats. I only give each one about a 1/4 teaspoon mixed in with their canned food, so the 14 ounce container lasts a LONG time - like a year!"
2,Disappointing results,I had hoped for some sort of a result from this product and basically saw no change. I'm not a novice dog handler. I've been at it for years. I thought the product would help improve my dog's coat and it did not. I wouldn't buy it again.
2,not at good as i hoped,"i had bought this fragrance because i owned the candle. i had always said, "" i wish they would make a fragrance from this scent!"" so when i found out it existed, i bought it. mistake. the odor is SUPER sweet, very different from the candle. when you spray it on, it's overwhelming. then in a short period of time, the scent completely disappears. i totally wasted my money on this especially buying it from the vendor i did. their shipping was very expensive considering the price of the fragrance itself, and then size and weight of the bottle, but i only found 2 vendors online that carried this, so i had no choice."
1,should be called vanilla spray,i purchased this product because it said Cocoa Tamarind but those were just 2 of several ingredients all of which were overpowered by a too-sweetvanilla scent. it was too sweet for me so i gave it away. not a bad smell but when you want cocoa tamarind it's just plain false advertising.
2,Too strong,This was not what I expected. I expected to smell more of the Cocoa but this was not the case at least for me. Too bad I couldn't wait to get it :-(
3,Christmas at Water's Edge DVE,"This happen to be an okay move. It didn't have all the bad words, that many thing one must use to get a point across. The acting was not the greatest, but these where not listed as top actress or actors. The plot was good. A young lady that thinks she is all that and above all others just bieng the daughter of well to do family. Spends money how and when she wants. Then its time to know what real friends act like. And really learn that is it better to give sometimes.This young girl I believe was in one on T.Perry's plays, she can really sing. Now would have like 2 see more singing from the teens.Many think they can do a much better job when I read reviews and they say that movie sucks and the acting was trouble, but they may not have had to make a movie in a week, or the actress walks out and they had to just make do with whom they have. But at lease they tried, and to get a point across."
1,their heart was in the right place,"Their heart was in the right place, but I wouldn't waste my money on this movie. I am a huge fan of both of the main actors, Hall and Pullian, but was greatly disappointed in the overall production value and screenplay. With a slightly more believable story, better dialog, and better cinematography/production value, this could have been a great movie. I hate to bash anything someone has put time/effort into, and especially with actors I really like, but truth be told, I can't recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Packages,A+++ you deserve it! I was well please with your service. You kept your word and shipped it right out
5,Wonderful Movie!!!!,I loved this movie!!! It's a nice family movie with a good morale. A must see. I would recommend this to anyone!
4,Cute movie...,"This movie was very refreshing and teaches the meaning of Christmas, spreading God's Love with others and selflessness. Pooch and Keshia did a wonderful job. This is a great family movie and fun to watch."
5,Perfect,This is a very good christmas movie. Everyone should purchase a copy to add the their christmas movie collection.
4,So Wonderful!!,"I first saw this movie on TV. The second time it aired, I recorded it. The third time, I just had to purchase it. It is a wonderful movie about how busy we can get, but it is not too late to redirect what is important and that is our family."
1,sorry but its true,i think it is very stupid and does notr even deserve one star so thasts my review ijhdsakjhds
4,BEST DRIVING GAME I'VE EVER SEEN,"I hav had this game for 4 years.Still this is the best driving game I've ever played. It has a good graphic and especially I love the damage mode that this game has. Cars are realy the dream cars.BUT, this game only runs on windows 9x and Me. And this is the worst thing about this game."
2,Not that great.,The graphics on this game might be ok but I was really dissapointed in the gameplay after playing Need For Speed SE. All the cars seemed to drive and handle the same to me. They sound pretty much alike too. If you want a real racing game get Need For Speed SE.
2,BORING! REALLY BORING!,"I bought this game thinking it will have many places to race. But i was wrong! The game is bad, the graphics aren't good at all, and the races are repeated rapidly with the same amount of racers, with the same type of cars they had on previous races. The other problem is that when you're bored of racing cars, you can't cruise any where. You are forced to race wether in championship series or in single player races. The other thing you can do other than racing is to be a cop and chase riders and try to give them three or more speed tickets. Other than that, there's nothing else to do! ..."
1,"TERRIBLE GAME! DON""T BUY!!!",This game is the worst game I ever bought! Every thing is fuzy the trees are just green balls the people have no faces! The cars are stupid and the music stinks.If you want a good driving game ... just don't get a game by electronic arts.
3,Some Mambo and (Lots of) Other Music,"I was disappointed by this CD. There are a couple of songs you could actually dance a mambo to, but there are other tempos mixed in as well. There is some rumba, chacha and some songs that are too fast for true mambo dancing. Not bad overall, but if you are in the mood for real mambo music , get you hands on some Tito Puente or Eddie Palmieri."
4,"Great Idea, just a bad thermometer probe","My spouse bought this for my birthday this year,2011. I used it about a dozen times when I notice problems with the wire leading to the metal probe. The heat caused the plastic to melt and the wires to short out therefore not giving accurate readings. I really only want to purchase the defective part. I really love this product if only I could find the part !!"
4,Sharp XL-MP60,"Very good sound quality. I find the remote not very responsive. I can't figure out a way to make the clock the default display. All in all, well worth the price for the quality of the sound."
4,Nice compact player,"Very good features but instructions are something to be desired. No simple explanations of terms/instructions. You have to guess what goes where, how & why!"
3,Awesome product but dented cans!,"These beans are heavenly and we love them, so we thought we would start a subscription for them to be delivered to us. Unfortunately, when I opened the box and the plastic packaging inside, there were three seriously dented cans in the middle of the set of cans. I find it hard to believe that they have gotten that dented where they were placed in the center of the set of cans without messing up all the cans around them unless they were set in there that way, so we paid for 12 cans and end up with only 9 usable cans. Unless I find a way to get the other three cans to replace these I will be canceling the subscription and not buying this brand any more.It is too expensive in our local health food store, and we thought this would be a great idea. Since we got three unusable cans it ends up being too expensive again. Too bad since it's a wonderful product my whole family loves."
2,Don't care for the seasoning,"Buyers should be aware that these are not plain refried beans--they're already seasoned. Unfortunately, I don't care for the seasoning. It's not terrifically strong, but I don't like it and didn't expect it: I thought I was buying just refried beans. I'd much rather season the beans the way I like them. I generally like Amy's products, and I'm a big supporter of organic foods, but I won't be buying these again."
4,the name of this says it all.........,Hostility has an excellent way of creating bad ass riffs and hard as hell drums! I will not say what songs are a must to listen to because the whole album is ON IT! I will say they do an excellent cover of black diamond....for you Kiss fans. I like this album as well as both Gulch(former Hostility) albums. Well worth the cash that delivers a kick to the ass!
5,The pickiest kids will love this brush!,"My son had always hated brushing his teeth, and we tried every product on the market until we found the Fresh & Go Toothbrush for Kids! He absolutely LOVES this toothbrush. He likes the taste, and he especially like how easy it is to put the toothpaste on the brush all by himself - because the toothpaste is inside!It is easy to put just the right amount of toothpaste on this brush - so it reduces mess! :) Your child simply turns a dial that is easy to manuver with little fingers. And it travels well, too! It comes with it's own cap to cover the brush!If you have a kid who is picky about brushing - try this brush!"
1,The thermometer with loss of memory,"I have a new freezer so this dandy item seemed to meet the bill. Unfortunately, the unit doesn't seem to really want to monitor freezers, but prefers refrigerators.About once every hour it will reset itself (there is no disturbance anywhere near it) and revert back to refrigerator settings. That means that the audio alarm - something critical for freezer monitoring - is useless and the temperature is always out of spec (OTOH, my freezer is running at about -10F, so there is some good news :)Tried to contact them via the web page, but it is out of service and I ended up at one of those redirect pages - sigh. I've dropped them mail and will post a followup should we get this resolved. It does concern me a bit that the instructions were copyrighted in 2002 - suggesting that the device may have actually been on a shelf for 3 years somewhere...."
5,Another good Polder product,"The Polder Digital REfrigerator/Freezer Thermometer does exactly what it is supposed to do: Monitor the inside temperature of my freezer. While I have had several freezer thermometers over the past decades, I like this one the best: I can set the temperature I want to trigger an audible alarm, I can turn off the audible alarm if I so choose (for instance, when I am reorganizing the freezer's contents), and I can always see what the inside temperature is. I also like the feature that permits removal of the battery unit without disturbing the stick-on pad when batteries need replacing.When the audible alarm is turned off, the temperature will flash if it exceeds the alarm limit I have set.As always with a new thermometer, I compared its reading to that of a known thermometer inside my freezer; the two were always within one degree.Replacement probes are available from Amazon."
5,A Good Cable,"If you have heavy gauge wire and solid connections, there is not much more that can be done to make a speaker cable move electricity efficiently and cleanly. So, I'm not sure there is much to the various high tech features Monster advertises with this... However, it definitely has heavy gauge wire and solid connections. So anything else that may or may not be relevant is just icing on the cake.This cable can easily carry way more current than anyone should be pumping through a 1/4 inch phono jack. I detect no flaws and see almost no room for improvement. 5 stars."
5,Speaker cables,You can hear the difference. Compare this cable to a standard cable and the sound is clear and full.
2,Shocked!,"I wanted to like this cable because it is a work of art (that's why two, not one star) and thought it might make me play like Clapton.Plugged it in and had a loud buzz(feedback) as if it wasn't grounded,and every time I touched it, the buzz(feedback) got louder.I unscrewed the ends and all connections looked good. I Plugged in my Fulltone cable and my much cheaper Monster Standard 100 cable and both had no buzz and sounded fine.I had to send it back, must have been defective somewhere else. Amazon was great in that regard. I guess I will just have to keep practicing and may try buying one again at a later time."
4,great album,"Wow, what an album. Its great to see someone from north central iowa (mayland is from Buffalo Center i believe) making it in the music business. Anyways, the album is solid indie rock if I ever heard it, some kind of offspring of Blink 182 and the Weez (my version of the album even has a cover of ""Undone""). ""My Frustration"" is perhaps the catchiest tune I have heard in years. Other stand outs include ""Entitled"" ""I Love You"" and ""Falling Star"" but all in all this is a cd i would recomend buying if you are into the afforementioned music."
3,"Beans great, dented cans not.","These beans are super yummy. However, I was disappointed that when my last order arrived, 10 out of the 12 cans were dented. Several of my previous orders were the same way. Considering the potential health risks, I decided to just buy them at the store."
2,Had to return it,"This item might have lived up to its potential if it had come completely ready to assemble. Thankfully I had only started to put it together, but the bottom shelf had a hole in the wrong spot for the way it needed to be put together. Had to return it but was glad Amazon took it back without hassle and helped with the return-shipping cost. Got something else instead."
4,Good for the Price,"I was looking for a simple ladder bookshelf that was this size and not expensive, and this one fit the bill. My two complaints were that 1) the instructions (which were just a drawing of all the parts with arrows telling you where each part goes) showed one of the pieces with a shape that was different than the actual part ( and when we assembled the unit we found that the part was correct and the drawing was incorrect); and 2) one of the pieces had been damaged. The damage is the size of a quarter which I can remedy with black paint so it wasn't worth pursuing a replacement part. Overall I'm glad I made this purchase."
3,Red Marks,I'm not sure if this is ordinary or isolated but each shelf had this odd red streak mark on it. Other than that you can't beat the price and it looks wonderful. Though I will say you will need at least two hours to put it together.
1,Disappointed,"The leaning book shelf looked nice on line and looked nice out of box, BUT is not sturdy at all. I put it up and it snapped in half. The bad part is I brought two of them; I still have one in the box,I guess I'll give it to Goodwill. :("
3,Quality isn't great,"It was fairly easy to put together with two people. It is pretty sturdy sitting on carpet, but I have noticed some of the shelves tipping a bit because they are rotating on the screws. It would be best with very minimal weight on the shelves."
2,Ladder shelves,"The shelves did meet my expectations as to to the way they looked, although when I received the product there were cracks and discolorations on the edges, that was a disappointment."
2,"not simple to put together, red marks in multiple area","It took 2 people to assemble, and a long time, as I am an average guy with a screwdriver. Also, the most upsetting, after I struggled to partly assemble it, my wife came home to inspect it and found multiple edges with red paint on them. As this was a Christmas gift, and not wanting to return it ,with all of those hassles, we used a black felt tip pen to try to cover over them. It worked ok, but time-consuming."
4,Good product,Looks great and easy to put together! Did it by myself within one hour. Good for our pictures but don't know if I would put anything too heavy on the shelf.
4,Good product,"Very cute, easy to assemble. The bottom shelf I cant seem to get flat though, I think the back support may be a bit too long for it. Other than that. everything is perfect and looks great on my wall."
4,worth the effort,"This was a lot more complex to assemble than I had planned on...which wouldn't normally be a problem as I'm pretty good at putting things together, but I ordered this for my office and had it shipped directly there. Unfortunately I don't keep a multi-tip screwdriver in my desk. I don't know why they included an allen wrench; you need a phillips and flathead to assemble. Once I had the proper tools, it wasn't too hard for me. Though two of my co-workers said there is no way they could have put it together.Now that the shelf is all put together, it looks great! Nice clean look, doesn't take up too much space, and the best part is it gives a home to so much of the clutter that was on my desk (picture frames, books, plants).If you are somewhat handy, this shelf is worth the effort."
2,Horrendous Customer Service...Wrong / Damaged parts!,"The piece itself is relatively easy to assemble, and looks pretty good in low lighting for the offered price (bought 2 @ $61.50). Unfortunately when I opened the first box, one of the shelves was significantly damaged, and in the second box, one of the leg pieces was missing, and another had been duplicated. I attempted to contact their customer service multiple times, and never got anywhere. I finally had to order a third book shelf, replace the missing/ damaged parts, and return one of the three back to amazon for a refund. Not a fun process!"
1,Bad,First of all the product came with a broken peice which already sucks. The directions or lack of we're terrible. They didn't show you how I do anything. After a while the peice that is supposed to prevent it from leaning against the wall broke! It's a peice of crap DO NOT BUY!
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","These shelves are very, very flimsy. I use them to put brochures on but, I would never put anything else on these shelves!! I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,Quality is lacking and missing parts,"I had higher hopes for this. Among the issues I have:- Paint does not have even coverage and is exposed in some spots.- Missing washers for anchoring to the wall. Was to be included according to the instructions.- Had to file the pre-inserted dowels on long leg pieces to get to fit. Afterwards, does not look square at all.Gotta say I am disappointed and wished I would have just done it from scratch and even saved a few bucks.I initially rated it 2 stars but that was the Minnesota nice in me."
1,cheap material,this piece came broken (a big crack near the leg). Overall quality was pretty bad. I have tried contacting the seller and waiting to hear from them.
4,Awesome bookshelf,Extremely pleased with this purchased... exactly what i was seeking and simple to assemble (20 mins top). I will be purchasing another soon.
3,Main dowels broke immediately - I like it though,"I just received this item and began putting it together about an hour ago. I thought that I had it together exactly and went to move it and it broke into two pieces. The two main pieces are held together by 2 dowels on each side. You screw in a wood screw and it goes through the dowels to hold it together. The problem is that these 4 dowels are very flimsy and certainly can't hold anything together. I like the shelves enough to drill out the dowels and replace them with better ones.I don't know how to get ahold of the manufacturer to let them know about this, however, so I'm posting it here."
2,Spare Yourself,"There are some put-it-together projects you feel like tackling for an hour and a half (if you're handy with an all-purpose drill) but this thing isn't one of 'em. Got this to put together for a guest room being redone in a sort of minimalist, post-modern style. Thought it would be a cool accent piece for guest-room books and DVDs. I am good at cobbling these sorts of things together even if the directions might as well be xeroxed in ancient Sanskrit, but this thing was NOT worth my time. One of the few true nightmare ""assembly required"" products I've encountered and the finished product was underwhelming, to say the least. The material is super-cheesy, the thing has a tendency to list in one lopsided direction, and the shelves are wobbly/unstable. Often, the blood/sweat/tears required to assemble is mitigated by a decent finished product. This is not remotely worth your time or the abject idiocy you will feel upon seeing it after 2 & 1/2 hours of ridiculous assembly."
4,Perfect for the price,"I really love these leaning shelves but I wasn't looking to break my bank. I ordered two of these and the delivery was almost instantaneous which was fantastic. It didn't take long for me to put together both of these by myself. Only complaint was the joints in the two sides don't really line up evenly, but I plan on sanding them smooth and repainting the finish."
3,"Cute, but flimsy","I love the stylish look of this book shelf. However, you could bump it with your foot and books would be tumbling off of it. It's light in weight. However, very easy to put together."
4,Nice product,"This product is nice. Sturdy, nice color and fits perfectly where I needed it. However, it did take 3 weeks (20 days) to be delievered which was a little frustrating."
5,A-dorable,"i had looked eveywhere for a ladder style bookshelf and had no luck at all, i have never ordered furniture offline before which made me a little nervous but it actually came sooner than the date they gave me.... and my boyfriend put it together in less than an hour and said it was very easy. It looks great in my apartment and it isn't flimsy at all (in about the first hour we got it together my cat jumped on it for his one and only time! but it held him fine..... and hes not light on the weight) but i recommend this to everyone looking for a modern style bookcase! I probably would have spent more money at an expensive furniture store than the actual bookshelf and shipping together cost. ITS GREAT!"
1,junk,"Do not buy these shelves. This item is a cheap piece of crap. The pieces were mislabeled, scratched, and didn't fit together properly."
3,Looks better than it functions,"I thought this was just AMAZING when I saw it on here. Looks great in the house, too. I've had it only a few months and the shelves are getting very loose and are tilting so my items are sliding to the back of the shelves. The covers for the screw holes are also popping off where the screws are backing themselves out. I won't say that I'm a perfect assembler so maybe some of the issue is operator error but I've put together plenty of items that don't go loose. :/"
4,does the job,"Great price. Had to improvise because the fastener for the bottom support leg failed. Otherwise, looks great. Ours holds our phone, laptop, and tablets."
5,Great Buy!,"I received this yesterday and it arrived undamaged. It was very easy to put together without the assistance of someone else. Much easier than any IKEA furniture I have purchased in the past. I have been looking for a shelf like this, and will say this is well worth what I paid for it. I may even buy a second one!!"
5,Just as described,"Received the product in perfect condition. The directions were precise and easy to follow, I actually just followed the pictures. I have read previous comments that state that the shelf was hard to assemble and needed more than one person and also that there were fibers on the product. I find this was not true and it was very simple to put together. Also the fibers were not really a problem I planned on cleaning it after assembly like I hope most would do. It was just from the packing materials. Better looking in person than in the picture. I did not have to secure it to the wall since my children are old enough to know not to climb on furniture and it is stable enough to hold my books/nick nacks without falling."
4,"Excited at first, but found item to be damaged!","When I received this shelf I was so excited. I have recently changed my decor taste and this was a shelf I was very nervous to purchase, since it's something I wouldn't normally go for.The box was in great condition so I wasn't expecting any disappointment. I opened it up and the bottom shelf was the first to come out. It was heavy, a very beautiful black color and was well constructed. When the second shelf came out the side panel was damaged. That's when the disappointment set in.I have to send the whole entire shelf back for a refund. But since I have gotten a chance to see the shelf now, I will wait for my refund and purchase 2 instead of 1.I would recommend this shelf to anyone because the quality of construction was great compared to alot of shelves that are out there.Once my new shelves come in I will complete my review of this product."
5,Leaning Ladder Book Shelf,LOVE these shelves! I bought 2 of them for our house. They are heavy-duty and nicely made. They look very classy and the finish is beautiful. Would buy again in an instant.
5,Great looking bookcase for the money,"I really wanted a ladder style book case, but most of them cost far more than i was willing to spend. I found this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I have been very happy with my purchase. Assembly was easy and the bookcase looks great in my living room. I was concerned that it might not hold much weight, b/c most of the pictures I see of ladder style shelves include only a few books, with a lot of decorative items. But I have loaded all but the top shelf (too small for ordinary books) with books, and it has held up very well for a few months so far."
1,ladder bookcase has two left feet so 1 lonley star till solved,"i love the look but there r no instructions not even diagram except picture on outside box it came in but a heck of a lot of screws and pegs and thingys and things lol. and if not misteaken ha i recieved to left legs if u will andw if u flip it over to correct problem they will not go all the way together.. its the two long ladder sides, the only ones that came with black pegs pre inserted not the glu in ones i need a little /well lot of help..... thanks in advance P. i will attempt video when done if not photos"
4,Build a Better Toy Train Layout,I thought that the book was well written and provides a broad overview of the subject without getting involved in all the details. The author recommends other publications to get down to the nitty-gritty. An excellent book for those wanting a broad overview on how to proceed to build a toy train layout.
3,USE CZS NOT TINY WINY DIAMONDS,Love their designs and they have always been a good seller. SilverSpeck.... PLEASE use czs in your products instead of these disgusting little diamond chips that no one seems to like. Either they are to small and no one can notice them or there is barely any to notice. Little czs would be waaayyy more attractive. TRUST me on this one :)
5,Great for clean ups,These Comfort Bath washclothes were a life saver when my husband had surgery to remove his left kidney due to cancer. They were being used at the hospital and I though they were a good idea so I ordered some. They were great to use to clean him up while he couldn't get in the shower. Personel hygiene for him was so much easier for me to handle.
4,Talented Singer/Songwriter Praises God,"As I listen to this CD, I'm drawn into scripture. Loving and fearing God are part of my life and these songs have a great folk rock feel to them with a message aimed at your heart. Jill does a great job balancing the dynamics of her vocals with the guitar and percussion work. The music on this disc is organic and warm. A nice addition to your Christian collection..."
4,glad to find this hard to find item,"I had one from ten years ago so this was a replacement. I could not find this at any of the big box home improvement stores. Happy to find it here! Got it in a few days time as well, as expected."
2,The Shells Scrached The Phone,"I just got this item and tried to put it on my Razer. It took quite a while to get the shells on. Then I found out these plastic shell actually SCARTCHED my Razer. Leaving a dark mark. I wasn't happy at all.Go for a leather case if you want some kind of protection for your phone. Otherwise, your Razer is just as good as it is."
2,Motorola thin shell,I was very pleased with the product it made my phone look like a new phone. The only problem that I have is that I had it for two days I drop the phone and the shell completely broke.
2,Fell apart in a month or so,"I really liked the case initially. It fit the phone well and looked elegant. Unfortunately, it started breaking in the weaker sections and became unusable in about a month. The plastic was too brittle."
3,good product but the software needs work,"I purchased a Meridian Marine and was disappointed to find that the BlueNav Chart software has serious shortcomings. First you can only download one small chart on one SD card. Chesapeake bay, for example, has 3 different charts so you have to erase the SD card and re-load another map. If you are in a sea kayak it is tough to take a lap top. Also you can't download your track into a PC, which is a problem for sailboats. Your other option is to buy the extra large charts on an SD card which is quite expensive. If you buy this unit with the idea of loading Marine charts you will be seriously disappointed. Buyer beware check it out with Magellan, the website glosses over these shortcomings. The hardware works well if you want to download maps into the unit get an SD card reader it will save you hours of time over a serial connection."
4,Bohemian and Nostalgique,"I stumbled on to this record at a music store. I liked the cover. If you enjoy piaf lyrics with haunting music, you will love Sur La Colline. The lyrics are beautiful, my favorite is L'amant d'un jour et L'amour ma heine. Very cool. This is a fairly short album, but sweet. Hope the next will be longer for more enjoyment. This cd also reminds me of the image of Serge Gainsburg. French lover seems like something serge would sing. Defenately recomended for those who are artsy. Did not give five stars because I though this cd could have been a bit longer."
3,It's Ok,"I purchased this item for my six year old daughter. She was pleased simply because it was Barbie...but, I for one had problems with the Math activity. You have to enter your answers in backwards (i.e. 6+26 has to be entered 23 instead of 32 to be correct). I feel that this is misleading in teaching a child math skills.Overall, I was not very satisfied."
4,Angel of the Prairie,"Paula Frazer is one part Neko Case alt-country, one part k.d. lang modern torch, and one part Elizabeth Fraser soaring vocalesse. Her songcraft borrow liberally from classic 60s/early 70s pop country, and some of the pieces and their arrangements will remind listeners of the ""countrypolitian"" orchestrations of Hem. Patsy Cline, the Carpenters and obscure 60s pop songs are the terrain she explores. Her voice is simply thrilling when it slides from a heartbreakingly fragile alto to a wordless flighty soprano that would make Roy Orbison green with envy."
4,Works - Simple and Inexpensive,"I doubt that this is a Ryobi manufacturer's spare part, but it works. Not a lot to it, but it doesn't cost all that much either. It's missing the little decal around the hole in the middle and doesn't come in a blister pack.This is just a metal rectangle with a hole in the middle. It's not sharpened. The hole fits, the blade is the right length. It doesn't fly apart when edging. In short, it works as it's supposed to. What more do you want?"
4,Edger Blade works well,"This edger blade, which is no longer carried in stores, works well. Thanks goodness for Amazon, and for people who carry these blades. (I love my edger / weed-eater combo and do not want to have to replace the whole thing.) The outer edge was slightly clipping the housing at first (barely fit) but did not stop it from spinning / operating. Shipped within stated timeframe."
3,Ryobi Edger Blade 613223 - too long,"The part number of the blade matched the part number listed in my manual, but the blade was about 1/8"" too long to use in the edger. I ground 1/8"" from each end and it worked fine. This was not a problem for me, but if someone bought it and didn't have a good grinder to size it, this would be a problem."
1,Blades did not fit the Ryobi I had (edger) that was mentioned by the website that it would fit.,Blades did not fit the Ryobi I had (edger) that was mentioned by the website that it would fit.
2,Product Works but poor quality metal,Product fit the edger and worked but the wear on the blade was faster than other blades purchased. Steel quality was low
5,what I wanted no more now less,simple rectangle piece of metal with a whole in it. Works fine. Delivery was quick. This is not brain surgery. Could not be lower tech.
4,A fun and somewhat challenging game,"I played this a decade ago and loved it then. Coming back to it now and playing it did not disappoint. I have enjoyed games like Diablo, Revenant, Diablo II, Baldurs Gate, Champions of Norath and found this game to be one of the better games out there in this genre. I feel confident that I can let my boys play it as well as it does not have the gore, blood and sensuality of many of the other titles. I recommend it."
2,Manages to take the worst parts of both Diablo and Quake...,"and make something entirely not fun. This is NOT an RPG, it's a deathmatch fantasy action game. To it's credit, it has nice graphics and pretty good spell effects. Other than that it's Diablo without the originality, and Quake without the visceral adrenaline-pumping action. It's a dumb game, with a dumb concept, and no ground-breaking ideas to it's credit. Don't bother..."
5,all day long,hi if you don't have this game i played it 8 days no stoping and my eyes were blood shot because it was so exciting and so deep a story line i could not get off of it till my mom ran me off so if you like diablo 2 or 1 [i did not] or if you want a excllent game get nox [ts worth the $20.00] you will love it
1,Terrible,"I will never understand these 7+ minute remixes on latter Jamiroquai singles, they are looping, monotanous and bad. Also this cd cmes in the dreaded slipcase tray. Maybe they were good for early 90's dancefloors but now they are redundant. this single is no exception with 2 very long remixes and a radio edit of the title track. Would not recommend unless you are a completist, in which case get the 8track USA maxi release."
5,Best emergency light for price,Have used these for years. Last 2 - 3 years with modest use. Very tough. Nothing better found. Price great. Carry in car.
1,ripoff,"the seller noted that the item was new ,but when i got it,it had scratches across it and where the screws go to tighten it down.the only reason i didn't return it was it was working."
4,Extras review: Translator Notes and Letters Column,"OMG has *the* most impressive translator notes (the book calls it the Editors's Commentary) I've read in a manga. Where other manga will have bare minimum single page of notes, OMG has detailed comments about not just the translations, but the inside-jokes and references by the original author (some of which the editor admits to not understanding!). Additionally, the notes digress a bit into the editor's otaku impressions, often during a trip to Japan. The manga preserves the letters column from the OMG comic books days, providing more interesting background and insight of the series, the author, and Japanese culture. This is one of the best extras I've had the pleasure to read in a manga!"
2,Not especially good,"The art is pretty well done, but the story of the book is rather cheap and simplistic. I've read my share of manga and my experience so far with this series is that it's relatively poor. It's really a quite juvenile and episodic fantasy about having a goddess for a girlfriend, without any real thought as to the ramifications of some events (questions arise such as, if it's as easy to get a wish as dialing a wrong number, why isn't the world filled with people who have their own wishes fulfilled?). Some people might enjoy this title, but it's not terribly deserving of praise."
5,I'm an electrical engineer but no SPICE expert,"This book will take you from using SPICE to using SPICE with a decent knowledge of what's under-the-hood. It's well organized, uses a good consistent vocabulary, provides many examples and code snippets, does a good job decomposing some of the constructs (model innards, etc.) that you might use and wish you knew more about. I hope this helps somebody checking out this book. The table of contents is viewable so check that out. There's also a section on converge which is really helpful."
1,VERY Poor Quality,"The Black Toner cartridge (T028) stopped working with 2/3 of the ink still in it. Repeated cleanings did not solve the problem. I have tried to find a guarantee for this product, but so far have been unable.I would NOT buy this product again"
2,Polycarbonate rod,Warning the description of the rod is smooth and clear. It has a mill finish and is opaque. It will only be clear once it has been polished. So it is not as described. Otherwise it is a poly carbonate rod. I gave it 2 stars only because of the description to warn people.
5,Why must the good ones break up?,"I started rolling through the roster of Century Media bands (Stuck Mojo, Nevermore, My Own Victim) & pleasantly discovered OLW. My God, what an incredible CD! This truly was some of the best songwriting I had ever heard in my life! A unique singer, fused with metal and punk roots proved to be the right mix throwing in some very heavy, trompy riffs at just the right time to remind you they are a metal band. Even the haunting ""Hank Crane"" is a standout as well as the powerful ""Downpour"". Do yourself a favor, get this CD and show youself (& anyone else you can) what real music is supposed to sound like!!! PLEASE REFORM!"
2,Less than what it seems.,"Just for your information, despite what the product picture would lead you to believe, this product does NOT include dumbbells. They must be purchased seperately."
3,Disappointing in comparison,I purchased this book aswell as Bicycling Magazine's Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance and Repair and although this book is o.k. the Bicycling magazine's one has more detailed information and is far less expensive. For the money and the reputation I really wanted this one to be better but alas it wasn't.
5,"Direct, succinct, detailed, Up-to-date!","For decades, bicycle repair manuals repeated the same kind of general instructions for maintaining and repairing the bearings and mechanisms of the bicycle. Over the past 20 years, new mechanisms and materials used in bicycles now require more attention to torque settings and other adjustments, some of which are brand-specific. This new book strikes a data-packed balance between the general advice and the details relevant to modern bicycles for home bicycle mechanics. It doesn't read like a novel to me, though; it's top-notch technical writing!"
3,Lacks an index,"This book is a strong showing for a book that was published by a bike tool company -- a first effort, apparently.However, it needs an index.Haynes, which has a bike book along with its auto books, generally has pathetic indexes (very sparse), but at least they sometimes work for the reader.Let the next edition of the Park book benefit from a strong index!"
3,Not the best detailed book,"The book gives some helpful info and direction to aid in the maintenance of your bike. It does include some photos but it seems to be lacking when it comes to detailed diagrams and often refers the reader to the Park Tool website for more info. Overall, it is a useful book but, if you are new to bicycle maintenance you will probably find yourself looking elsewhere for more detailed instruction."
5,Everything I need to repair a bicycle,I have had the book for a year now and I am very happy with it. I have made all the major repairs to my bike with these clear instructions. I have some Park Tools but this works well with any tools you might have - they do tell you the appropiate Park Tools if you like to buy those...
4,Tells you how to fix it.,"Well written for the novice, do-it-yourself biker. Illustrations suppliment the text and help identify parts, tools, and techniques required. Book has an unusual number of typos and spelling errors but that doesn't impact the overall usefullness. A good addition to any bike riders library."
3,disappointing,this book does not live up to expectations. The biggest draw back is it's small size. It really looks like a book that was intended to be larger in height and width and was then reduced to save printing costs. The photos are small and blurry and not always from the best angle. In most cases an illustration would have served better than the photos used. The physical size of the book is 10 inches by seven inches. Todd Brown's Bicycle Repair and Maintenance is eight and a quarter by eleven inches.I'm suspicious of the first two reviews of this book. The average consumer does not write like that. They look like professional advertising copy.
4,Off the wall fun!,"MALICE is a fun, raunchy roll (in a good way), reminiscent of John Waters and Mel Brooks. The production design is amazing, as well as the costuming and make-up. If you love hilarious ""drag"" content, you'll love this film."
2,There are better batteries,This battery BP-800s is obly 800mAh and lacks the necessary juice. It will last for about 70-80 pictures max under normal use in Kyocera S3 camera in my experience.The New Kyocera S5 camera has an upgraded battery BP-1000s which is 1000mAh and will last for about 120-140 photos- almost twice as many. This new battery is available only with new S5 camera at this time but soon should be available in market just by itself.So if you are not in a rush wait. Also there is a BP-900S which is 900mAh available in market.
2,Interesting history but waaaaay overpriced,"It's not a book but a pamphlet which has a cover price of $1 stamped on it. It's worth about 5 bucks maybe, no more. I read it in about 45 minutes. It is comprised of about 6 very short stories. Interesting but I felt ripped off when it arrived."
4,This belt is cool!,I bought the child belt and the figure belt. My son enjoys both. Now he can be John Cena with a belt and his figure can also wear a belt. Very cool!
2,what happened?,"they slowed it down big time on this there third and final album. the drummer vinnie daze died of some weird disease while in africa. the band was on it's way out any way, as the singer and one guitar player wanted to mellow out like on this album. that was the downfall of the band. buy the first 2 albums they are 2 of the most under rated thrash/speed metal albums of all time."
3,Nice Try,"This game had the potential to be outstanding. The avionics are lacking in realism. The F-15 radar looks like an F-16 display and the RWR is usless. Like most software companies, EA has produced a product that will only work on certain computers. Don't try this one on a computer loaded with Windows XP. It works for a day or two and then has to be reloaded."
4,"Great Sim, a few flaws","This is one of the best games I have ever played. The game really never gets boring with tons of premaid missions, the ability to make new ones (there is a quick mission editor for simple missions and a more advanced one to make more complicated missions) and a ""Fly Now"" command that randomly puts you in one of the eight planes. Mostly, the graphics are good except for explosions on the ground. Other bugs include the game choosing to close for no reason and the repeating of a broadcast on the radio until the end of the mission. That might be due to my computer though. I still hightly recommend this game."
5,Incredibly Accurate,"This game is about as close as it gets short of flying the real aircraft. I spent many years in the military as a fighter crew chief....and they definately did their homework. Attention to detail and graphics are spectacular. Additionally, the ability to create your own games is a major plus. Voice commands execute flawlessly. The one negative I have relates to the (...)poor documentation....I finally broke down and manually typed the commands into a word document....lot of work, but given the quality of the game, was worth the effort."
2,too confusing!!!!,This game is too confusing! I have the joystick the memory and the game. It's hard to get off the ground much less hit something when your in the air. The sarcastic flight instructer get's on your nerves after a few of his comments. The graphics are great and if you are good at flight simulators buy this game. If not skip it.
3,Too bad... It had a lot of potential.,"This game made a very good impression on me. In fact, I thought it was the best ever. However, there's a big ""but"". There are so many BUGS!!! It is unbelievable that Jane's was able to release this thing with so many bugs. I was put in disbelief, because this game has some of the best graphics and realism I've ever seen for a fighter-jet game.I know what you're thinking, though. Look for a patch? Nope. Jane's Combat Simulations apparently abandoned their long-lived legacy of combat flight sims right after releasing USAF. Unbelieveable.Bottom line... This game is nothing but a disappointment."
4,Great Classic Christmas CD,"Looking to update my Christmas CD collection, I chose this CD. It had so many of the ""classic"" Christmas songs...that being said, I love the first CD. And part of the 2nd, but honestly the second half of disc 2 is pretty bad. Britney Spears, N'sync? Yuck. Anyway, for $9.99, you can't go too wrong. And actually, the Michael Bolton song is kind of cute!!"
5,Great Christmas music,Great combination of Christmas classics and contemporary Christmas music. My favorites are the classics though.
3,Great Seasonal Mix of Songs,"Really only purchased the CD for two songs (Santa Claus is Comin' to Town and Do They Know It's Christmas) and was pleasantly surprised to find some other ""keepers"" on the disc as well. It was quite a mix of older and newer songs, and a nice addition to my Christmas CD collection."
2,Boring - not what I was looking for...,"Boring - not what I was looking for...I wanted fun and upbeat Christmas songs, this did not meet those needs."
3,Mixed results.,The first CD is the best compilation of Christmas songs I have ever heard. The second CD is leveling my uneven dining table. The only good song off the second CD is John and Yoko's Happy Christmas. The rest of the songs are performed by recent artist. Caterwauling is what my uncle called it. And I would have to agree. Now That's What I Call Music should have just sold the first CD.
3,WOW! This CD is great...for grownups.,I am only nine years old...and I axedentley read the reivews by adults! So for grownups...you will love this CD!For kids...please don't get it.
5,Great album,"This is a collection of all the classics with some new artists thrown in. If you like the classic artists like Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Gene Autry, and so on then you'll love this album."
2,Only one disk included,I thought i was buying a double disk CD and it turns out I only got one disk included ... very upsetting
5,A wonderful collection of Christmas music!!,"When I first saw this CD was coming out, I knew I had to buy it. It contains music for everyone, from young children to elderly people. I have grown up listening to Bing Crosby on Christmas Day so I knew this CD would be good. The first CD has some of the best older songs and is definitely well-worth your money. The second CD is very good as well because if you are in the younger generation, you will greatly enjoy this CD. Overall, I like both CDs and think they would make your Christmas festivities more cheerful. If you have any doubts, BUY IT!!! Believe me, you won't regret it!!!"
4,Top Value and Great Music!,"I have a guilty little confession to make...I'm something of a Christmas music junkie. I have somewhere in the neighborhood of 80+ Christmas CD's, and seem to add to my nefarious collection every year. This year, among a few other CD's, I picked this up. I need help, I know. But I just couldn't resist! <grin>In all seriousness, this is an outstanding little collection for the money. It has a bit of something for nearly everyone to enjoy, and they wisely put the more traditional fare on the first disc, while disc two contains the more contemporary material. This makes an excellent background track during holiday mixers or when you're doing any number of a zillion holiday-related chores around the house. Go ahead and snap up a copy of this two-disc set today, and you'll be set for many Christmases to come!"
3,A Decent Xmas,"I found this only an OK CD set for a number of reasons. I liked the first CD because of its classic Christmas favorites. However, it went a bit downhill on the 2nd CD, since it's just mostly fairly recent Christmas songs by recent artists. On the 2nd CD, I only liked Britney Spears' ""My Only Wish"" and Lennon's ""War is Over."" I was disappointed that some of my favorite Christmas songs weren't on the CD set, like Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas."" Plus, I felt that the song ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" on the first CD should have been sung by Judy Garland, not Frank Sinatra. But this CD set is a good buy for your money and I do play it a lot."
2,product incomplete,CD was sent incomplete. I only received one of the two Cd's it was supposed to come with. What a disappointment. There was no mention that I was only receiving one of the two CD's.
2,I thought it was 2 discs...,"I only received 1 disc out of a 2 disc set.. and then got a ""not so nice"" email when I rated them poorly for it and asked me to take the rating down. Ha now that is funny..."
3,"Why Didn't They Put On Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays","They Can Inleast Put On N Syncs Song And Trade It In For The Other One. That Song Sucked. I Heard It Yesturday In My Teachers Classroom. But Everybody ""Merry Christmas, And Happy Holidays"""
2,"Pretty daggy, awful music - very painful to listen to!",I bought this because I had a huge bunch of uncool people coming round for a big Christmas Bash. They LOVED it! I guess I may be lacking the 'spirit' of Christmas a bit - perhaps it's an American thing..... However my (American) guests had a great time so it was money well spent!
3,"First Disc is great, second disk is already outdated","I don't recommend this compliation. The first disk is great, but they could have done better with the second CD. The ""modern"" songs already sound outdated; they're not classics and probably never will be. Just listen to the sample tracks."
4,Great album,Love the two cd's in the albums the old school meets new school together on one album... and Shipping was fast thanks.
3,"Same Old, Same Old",If you're looking for something new from a christmas Album then steer clear of this offering. If you don't have a single Christmas CD in your collection then this will more than meet your all round basic needs.
3,A good disc and a half of holiday music,"This is a good collection of holiday music, but the quality of the songs really tapers off on the second half of the second disc. Celine Dion, Gloria Estafen, Britney Spears, N' Sync, etc. on the second disc nearly spoil this otherwise great collection."
4,Tastiest Refried Beans I've Found,"Far and away the best canned refried beans out there. I must not be the only one who thinks so because they are hard to find even at Whole Foods. This specific variety is often sold out. So easy to buy a case at Amazon! The 12-pack I received was shrink-wrapped in a cardboard tray and packed in another box, but not well enough. Due to the poor packing, all cans were dented at their top...every single one! I'm happy to report, however, that the denting did not harm the fantastic taste and texture of these beans."
5,So glad we could buy it from Amazon,"We began using the Amy's Organic Refried Black Beans while living out West. Love this product!! This product is so tasty and better for you than the average refried beans. This is a home run at our house. Love the flavor, just the right amount of mexican flavor, not spicy, texture is appealing and best of all it is made from black beans.Since moving to the Southeast coast, we were disappointed to not have been able to locate this product in any of the local stores. We could, possibly, drive a couple of hours and maybe find it somewhere else but with the price of gas it is not feasible.Thanks Amazon for carrying this product. Soooo very happy to be able to purchase it through the Amazon site. Free shipping and delivered right to my door, what great service!!Thanks again!"
3,Not enough instruction... oil paintings mostly.,"This tome has very little in portrait instruction. The author is very good at portrait painting.. in a mid 20th century classic kind of way.Begginner and ""noobs"" seek instruction elsewhere.Does this help any? Click yes."
4,Not bad for the money,"This box came with several games on seperate disks, so you choose if you want to install one or all of them. The games I liked were, Theme Hospital and Sim Safari. The rest of them you could take or leave. But for the price, it was worth it just for the two games alone. Sim Theme Park never did work, or I couldnt figure it out, but it didnt look good enough to worry about anyhow, especially after playing Roller Coaster Tycoon. Sim Life, Sim Earth, Pinball and Marbles just collect dust.Theme Hospital is a great game with hours of enjoyment, great graphics, and humourous diseases like The Squits, which sends the patient to the bathroom alot, and Sim Safari is really cool where you set up a Wild Life Safari and a camp, by hiring locals from the village. As long as you do good, the village thrives. Its alot of fun. I rate this four stars only because the rest of the games sucked, but thats just IMHO."
3,Seller is ripping you off!,"I bought this item from Amazon (not a merchant) almost 4 years ago for ONLY $19.99. This seller is trying to sell it for $129.99! I am happy with the product, but I would never pay more than 6 times than what I did!"
1,SHAME ON THIS SELLER!,"JUST LIKE ALL THEIR OTHER MERCHANDISE, IT'S OVERPRICED! The big box stores sell these flashlights for $6.99. My kids have three of them. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!And, I see this store has changed their name, AGAIN. Wonder why?!"
3,entertaining for a 2 yo,my 2 yo who is obsessed w fire engines loves Fireman Sam. It gets quite annoying for me but I'd recommend it to your child...
5,Firman Sam's To The Rescue Video,"My 3 year old loves this video! It is well worth it, great for road trips too! It is so well done and if your child loves watching firemen ""save the day"", they will love Fireman Sam! Joyce, Key West"
4,Fireman Sam to the Rescue,"As for my husband and I, we find it annoying, however, our son loves it. He plays it over and over again. It does teach our son about important fire saftey tips, so that is good. It is perfect for a little boy ages 2 and a half and up."
1,"Dissatisfied, Never received item","I purchased this item over a month and a half ago. There was no tracking number for the shipment. I sent an email to the seller after 30 days letting them know my credit card was charged but I hadn't received the item yet. The reply was they would ship another product to me within 10 business days. Again, there was no tracking number for the second shipment. I still have not received this item. Very dissatisfied!I'm sure if I had received the item, my son would have loved it."
5,STILL GOING STRONG,With out a doubt the Magellan Meridian Gold is still going strong. Accuracy is still about 3meters or 10 feet. Great condition and well packaged!
1,that should not happen,"I got the meridian marine a week ago, but didn't have time to check it. Two days ago, I opened the box and turned it on to make sure it is working. it turned on, good, set the time and date, good. Turned it off. than I get curious about my new gps and wonder how it is doing. Tried to turned it on. Oopppss, try again, oops again,change batteries, did not help. I can't understand how a ""new"" product can die on the second try. It must be a quality concern!!I called the 800 number, wait 10-15 minutes, tried what she said,didn't help. she said it is most probably the battery holder.they want me to send it back, but I'm not sure who is going to pay for the shipment.I don't want to be hard on the product because I did not have a chance to use it. I just want to share my experience.Actually, this is what reviews are for,isn't it?"
1,Not for Automobile Navigation,"Not very functional, screen difficult to read, download information takes forever, doesn't use roads when calculating distances, does line of sight. Need lots of extras to make this even slightly useful. If you are planning to use this in your car, I would definitely get a different product as this is almost worthless. Won't hold much info from software as downloads are limited to 4 regions of about 16K."
2,Inaccurate,"The GPS consistently showed me 50-500 feet from my actual location. Reviews in the Mapsend Topo show others have had this problem. So if accuracy isn't an issue, great unit. I chose this unit for waterproof and SD card. I liked it except for accuracy which is very important to me."
1,Magellan Meridian a POS,1) Backlight display more like glows in the dark.2) Magellan tech expert claims any Secure Digital Card will work so why pay the rediculous Magellan prices.3) After sliding in a 16mb card the unit dropped dead. finito!
1,San Francisco?,"After playing with the Meridian for about an hour and thinking this is cool, I tried to find San Francsico in the ""goto"" listing of cities and I tried to find it alphabetically...no luck. I'm not going to trust the Meridian when I'm in the back counrty if it cant even find a major city. It's got to go. I'll stick with good old fashioned maps!"
3,Not Quite Ready for Prime Time,"I rated the Gold _unit_ 5 (*****)stars earlier. I have revised my rating to 3 (***) stars for the _system_. Alone, the unit rates a 5*. But, the _system_ does NOT.The 3rd generation GPS units are differentiated from the 2d gen by their ability to store a complete map, not just waypoints and routes.The Magellan Meridian mapping software has two primary titles, one a topo map, the other a streets and Points of Interest (POI) map. Both lack the easy trip planning features of 2d gen Magellan mapping software. You can still plan a trip, but it is much more difficult. But this isn't all.The upload methodology (to move the map into the GPS unit) is ridiculous, time consuming, and impractical.I was going to sell my old Magellan Tracker, and all the software & hardware I've accumulated for it. NOT now!In summary: A _great_ standalone unit with poor software."
2,Waterproof exterior? Only if the water is large ice cubes.,"It's a bit of a joke to include the word ""waterproof"" in the title for this product. The battery and memory card cover is so loose you can see right though it to the other side. Small sized hail would be able to get into this unit! Magellan uses the term ""rugged and waterproof"" on the box, and it does appear somewhat rugged, but by no definition of the word is it waterproof. Other than that ... this is my first experience with a GPS and to me, it seems unnecessarily difficult to use for anything other than ""hey look, I'm heading east at 3 mph!"". I'll spend the time and try and learn its idiosyncrasies, but I'm disappointed it wasn't more useful straight out of the box."
1,Worst support,"Purchased one of these and when I contacted the manufacturer, Magellan, was told they no longer offer support for the unit but they would gladly allow me some credit towards a newer model. Sure got screwed on that deal!"
3,Instructions way too fast for beginner,Tony Couch is an excellent artist. Although in this video he explains way too fast and fails to show us how he gets all the details into the drawing. The video is one hour long. It seemed to me the explanations Tony gave were rushed for the sake of getting all of the material shown in one hour. I think this video is better suited for intermediate artists who want to learn other techniques of drawing and painting in water colour.
3,drawing: the short course,"There are some very good pointers here by a very good sketch artist.Tony Couch uses on demand camera drawing to explain different drawing techniques, for example shapes, perspective and shading.I sure wish I had seen this 40, years ago."
2,disappointment,"the title (Drawing: learning Professional Technique)is very much contradecting the content, i suppose it is for beginners only, and only for beginners.the reviews tricked me so i bought it and was watshing it hopping i see professional techniques. but there was just simple perspective for beginners, does not worth the price."
4,very good,"compact and easy to follow guidelines on how to handle gross specimens. Definitely worth buying. I especially like the accompanying tables on immunohistochemistry and special stains, which helps a lot in daily work."
1,Why?,"How many times are they going to release this? It's not like itshard to find, and at a cost of next to nothing (a few bucks). This is thethird time the original Ultraman series has been released and nothing is beingadded to the dvd by doing so. If you really want this series, get the firstrelease by BCI Eclipse - they included several large colorful postcards,English/Japanese soundtrack option, and an episode guide - easily the bestUS release of the series so far. It'd be nice if these companies would atleast wait for the first batch to become scarse before re-re-re-releasingit again."
4,"""underrated""","Unfortunately, this cd didn't get the exposure it deserved. It's a bit on the dark side but the songs are very well done and will surprise you. For the price, it's a steal! If you like aggresive Metal with a sinister touch, then you'll enjoy this. I can't believe that these guys didn't make it big. They had tremendous potential! Take a listen. You'll be surprised too!"
4,"Good idea generator, need more detailed photos","Good basic technical information. Provides a nice overview of modification possibilities. Gives the reader a lot of ideas to build upon. Does a good job of explaining ramifications of modifications (good and bad) and why some are necessary (for example, structural/frame mods). The only thing I did not like was the lack of color photos throughout. Often I had to look at the black and white photos several times to discern details in the parts I was viewing. The photos were often too dark (most likely from the printing process) and lacked the necessary contrast to identify details I was interested in. I think higher resolution color photos would have helped."
1,less than a star because it don't work,"I've bought Triple Play Baseball twice (the second time two years after the first time, out of stubborness). It doesn't work. The first time I bought it (forget which version it was, they all stink), I installed it, set up a season, but when I tried to play, it froze. This week I bought it again (newer version) but when I try to run it at all, the same image repeats across the entire screen. I've gone to Compaq and Microsoft And EA SPorts' web sites and downloaded upgrades for my computer but it's no use. My computer is not exactly ancient, either.The game is awful I miss Old Time Baseball, an offshoot of Tony LaRussa baseball. And I just bought Baseball Mogul 2002. This time, Triple Play goes in the garbage, and if anyone asks me about this product, I'll laugh."
1,Very Evil Game Self-Destructs!,"I played this game four times and then I spent a week and a half trying to get it to work again. I keep getting the error message ""SOFTTRI_setdisplaymode - ERROR CODE (softtristatus) 80004005"". After removing and reinstalling the game, removing my other games, and upgrading DirectX, I still get the error, and I've given up. This may be a common situation. ... ... ... in the technical support forum.) The game is wonderful until it doesn't work. Do not buy it unless you really enjoy frustration!PS: Wait about a month until you order the manual. The game will quit working before you need it."
4,good game,"This is a fun baseball game. The graphics are great and the rewards (A cheat you get when you do things in a game, Like hitting a grandslam)are fun. It may seem fairly easy to fans of NBA live and NHL series (You can edit your players to have perfect stats and then kill the other team). But it's still a great game. It's really fun if you get a reward to make all your people midgets and run really fast."
4,henrajoa,this is a great game with great grapics and very real it's not a game that let's you hit a home run every time.
4,Pretty Good,"I think this game is pretty good the players our all real baseball players. It has many levels such as Single Game,playoffs,and Homerun Derby. Although I really don't have the jewel case I have the original version. All in all I am pleased."
5,inspired and unique,"I love astrology but never thought of using it for gift buying..this book showed me how interpretations of the signs can help make great gift selections. I also learned alot about well known people and their signs. It is a unique idea for a book, very, handy, and fun. The tables which introduce each sign are a gold mine of information and insights that I haven't seen in other astrology books. I recommend the book highly"
2,Ryder not at the top of his game here,"A concert of the Mondays back in the 1990s heyday would have been much better than this. Here, we see the Mondays at a 2004 reunion. Shaun Ryder sounds pretty bad, and you'd have to be the most forgiving fan not to notice. In the extras, Ryder sits in a pub for an interview and gives the most verbose, indirect and largely incoherent answers to questions you've ever heard."
5,Goodbye social life.......,"I bought this game when I was in search of a really good soccer management sim. Kind of like a Strat-O-Matic for soccer and this game definately fulfilled my search. So much depth yet so much fun. You are in control of who plays, who you acquire, tatical strategy, training.. everything. The amount of real players and leagues contained in the game is incredible. A true immersive experience in the world of international football. I highly recommend this game to all soccer fanatics that would love to try their hand at management of the world's greatest clubs. You can spend so much time playing this one, you'll want to stay home and keep playing. Forget a social life when you have a Champions League match in 2 days...."
5,Utterly addictive,Great game for soccer nuts. Endless options to choose from so you never play the same game twice.
1,So So book...,"I ordered this book for my son, who is a cat lover. We own ""101 uses for a Dead Cat,"" by Simon Bond and it is hilarious. I was hoping Nicole Hollander's humor would be similar to Simon Bond's, but was disappointed. The illustrations were great, but the jokes were not so funny. Plus, many of the comics were not proper for a young child to read. I am sadly disappointed. The illustrations really had me fooled into thinking this would be a winner! Would not recommend to family and friends."
2,I felt like an outsider...,"Let me say that I really loved her first album - great vocals, fantastic rhythms, very seductive. So I expected much the same from this one - a more polished intricate album, even better rhythmic interplay, I can't fault the vocals, she has a fine instrument, but after a while I noticed a continuing theme in the songs core subject material; things began to be less balanced, more feminine uber-allus, seemingly to the exclusion of all else. I felt strangely shut out - an odd sensation to have from a CD."
2,Disappointed...,"I bought Aeone's first cd Point of Faith and absolutely loved it so naturally I ran out and bought this one as well. Unfortunately, the music styles on this disc are so radically different I just can't feel the same connection. If you want to try it out, I suggest borrowing it from someone first. My advice, if you loved the musical style of Point of Faith, leave this one on the rack."
5,Great introduction to Institutional Research,"This book is a great introduction to Institutional Research. Chapters are written by some of the leading people in the field. Topics include: 1) Persistence (Michael F. Middaugh), 2)Enrollment Management (Craig Clagett), 3) Student Impacts (Jean Endo), 4) Faculty Demand (Michael D. McGuire), 5) Faculty Salaries (Richard D. Howard, Julie K. Snyder, and Gerald W. McLauchlin, 6) Peer Institutions (Deborah J. Teeter and Paul T. Brinkman), 7) Diversity (Daryl G. Smith), 8) Environmental Scanning (James L. Morrison), 9) Total Quality Management (Mary Ann Heverly), 10) Academic Program Review (Gary R. Hanson and Bridgett R. Price), and 11) Cost Analysis (Heather J. Haberaecker)."
3,Hose Kit,It's OK. Superfluous hose extensions and plastic doodads abound. Otherwise cheap alternative to buying tools individually.
4,1st Time Gardener,"It is great having the case hold all of the tools in place, makes it harder for me to lose things. Everything is pretty sturdy, the clippers and garden shears cut well and don't feel cheap. Its nice also getting a set of the quick connects for the hose, they locked in well. The build quality of the shovels were sub par they bent back and forth easily. But overall I was happy with my purchase."
3,Good until...,"This thermometer worked great for the 9 months I used it. I checked the calibration about once a month and it was always on. Display was large and easy to read and I never was suprised with the foods I was temping with it. One day the battery cover just falls off, I didn't even drop it or put it in the dishwasher like it says you can do. The real story here is getting a response from Polder is not possible. I emailed them 3 times over the course of a month, they never returned my requests. Don't look for this product to last a long time nor expect any type of customer service from Polder."
2,NOT Dishwasher safe as advertised on packaging,"One of the factors that drew me to this particular thermometer is that the packaging states it is ""diswasher safe"". I had always washed it by hand until one particular day it was especially greasy, and I decided to take advantage of the ""dishwasher safe"" quality. Just one run through the diswasher and it was fried! I tried to contact Polder through the email address on their website, and all my emails are rejected because the ""destination computer was not found"". I gave it 2 stars because I did like it while it worked - so if you wash by hand it should be okay. Just don't count of manufacturer support if it fails."
3,visual exercises - for serious designers,"This is a technical book that is an attempt to teach what RRK developed over a lifetime obsession with visual compositions. She did one thing, over and over, refining it over a long and productive career at Pratt, in Brooklyn. As such, I believe that it would best be used in the classroom, rather than as a simple read for those who want to understand modern design. Being ignorent about issues in studio design - really doing it, rather than observing it like I do - I got a lot out of it. But I will need to refer to it and read through many more times to truly absorb the exercises. For what it is, the book is a masterpiece as an exercise in visual thinking and the method left its imprint on many of the greatest American designers from before WWII to the 1980s.Recommended, but for designers rather than design critics."
1,Pretentious,"The book is old and pretentious. It describes Design as it was some sort of a religion (with Roweena as its prophet), that a Designer needs to stick to some basic rules, in order to generate a beautiful product.It doesn't really take the engineering part into consideration. For example, that a functional product kept very simple is usually beautiful.Also it hardly has any examples and some of the few are about 30 to 40 years old and not really convincing either.Maybe this book explains why most cars from the 70ties are somewhat unsightly.And last but not least the letters are pretty small, a pain to read."
4,Problems with S-Vid connection,"For the most part, this player is pretty good. I havent had any problems playing back dvds of various formats. However, the S-Vid connection is not good. My old DVD broke, I didnt feel like ripping apart my whole entertainment center to get to the back of my TV. Im buying an LCD this year so I figured id wait. My old DVD was hooked up via S-Vid so i just reused the same cable. Anyway, Everytime I play a DVD, It only shows up in black and white. I have to keep ""fiddlin"" with the S-VID plug to get it to show color. It only takes a sec and seems to hold for a whole movie, so its not so bad. I gave 4 stars cause 1) S-Vid is old (and lame) and 2)It could possibly be my cable and not the player at all."
4,High expectaions,"I have regained my respect of Panasonic in recent years. Thier electronics were the first brand I ever owned. Thier plasma monitors are fantastic. I purchased this unit to upconvert by DVD output to my HD montior. However, it appears the electronics in my plasma monitor are just not compatible with the HDMI technology, just a year too old. The unit itself is surprisingly small and has ample connections. It produces a nice picture. A couple of things I find annoying: 1) the only way to get the disk out of the tray is to stick your finger in the center hole of hte dvd, there is no way to grab it from the side, 2) the time delay for the display to show that the unit is turning on or off can cause you to hit the button twice and then you turnt he unit on and off and you didn't want to."
5,Worth the price of admission!,"Moss has really developed his talents as a songwriter and musician. His ability to play several instruments is impressive. He writes and sings about subjects that are in the forefront of today's social issues, but with his own flair and style. Moss pulls no punches and tells it like it is. The cover art on the CD is fantastic."
3,Jesus didn't come as a scholar,"For the price of this book, you could rent the movie many times.Turning to a book full of scholars can be problematic. They don't agree and it can be virtually impossible to separate facts from opinions.You can read the gospels for yourself (and very likely have) to get a good sense of how close Gibson stayed to the Gospels. You can read for yourself in the Gospels that they only say about Jesus' flogging that he was flogged and about Jesus' crucifixion that he was crucified. So you undoubtedly don't need scholars to realize that Gibson went beyond the Gospels to convey what the flogging and crucifixion may have been like.Reading these scholars may inform you. It may also confuse you. What remains open to serious question is the film's focus on the death of Jesus as a sacrifice. You may do well to consider whether that was helpful to you. You may also wonder how that focus on sacrifice, as well as any critique of it, might be being manipulated nowadays."
1,A-1 NEW YORK MARINADE (6 PACK),"Well I ordered this product and the box was mis marked so I recieved the wrong item. I called and explained to customer service, they resent the product, again they resent the wrong item. A total of 18 wrong marinades I have recieved. I just gave up. the product is fantastic if you can ever get it. I usually buy it at the grocery store, its safer there. Too bad Amazon's Quality Department can not correct this error.Diane"
2,Unfortunate buy.,"This is probably the most uncomfortable pair of earplugs I have ever worn. They don't fit in your ear well; they're not malleable to the shape of your ear canal whatsoever. As a result, if they don't fit well, no soundblocking at all occurs. This is absolutely useless."
3,This is not for airsoft.,"No, I do not own this product. However, when it says airsoft, it means that the brand type is airsoft because the earplugs are cushioned by air. Please do not think this is for airsoft, as it is not."
4,Cheaper over time; but still do the trick,"Like with many mass produced products, they can often get cheaper (quality) over time. I had a set of Tiger Kicks 20 years ago and remember them being of better quality (thicker, heavier stitching). Some of the padding is more ""strategic"" than the earlier verions which is better. Otherwise they serve their purpose well and I like that you don't get as slimy/sweaty with these like you do with typical foam gear."
2,??,"Prometheus Bound is a play about mythical Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, and was punished by Zeus to be bound to a rock. The play itself is very short and if you are familiar with the fable, this book really doesn't add much."
4,HARD EDGED AND ROCKIN' ..................,"I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DVD TO BE SET IN THE NTSC FORMAT AND BOY WAS THE WAIT WORTH IT. THIS SHOW HARKENS BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN MUSICIANS WERE OUT THERE TO ENTERTAIN. IAN HUNTERS VOICE IS THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS BEING 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5. IAN'S THICK ENGLISH ACCENT SOMETIMES MAKES IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS TO HIS SONGS. THAT SAID, ALL THE OTHER PIECES ARE IN PLACE TO EQUAL ONE ROCKIN' CONCERT. HIS SLOWER SONGS LOOSE SOME OF THE FEELING BECAUSE OF HIS, SOMETIMES HARD TO UNDERSTAND, WORDS BUT IF IT'S ROCKIN' YOU WANT, THIS IS A GREAT SHOW............"
3,What Else Could Be Expected?,"Well, here it is. Edwin left I Mother Earth on the basis that they wanted to go different ways in te directions of their music, and in Another Spin Around The Sun he sounds like he wanted to go the route with the most pot on it. Most of the songs on this album can be found to be hinting to marijuana or blatently singing about it, leaving one to wonder just what it was Edwin really saw in his solo career. Anyone who listened to him on IME's productions 'Dig' and 'Scenery And Fish' can say that weed has always been around those guys, but this album shows the true affinity Edwin has for the sweetleaf. We can't blame him, but I think Snoop Dogg had that one wrapped up in the lyrical bag. Nice try, but I think we can expect more to come from the guy who was the frontrunner of Canada's best kept secret, right?"
4,Cool...,"I give this four stars simply because the sky-diving and base jumping shots are awesome. Loved those. Didn't care much for the scientific explanations behind adrenaline junkies...really wanted more IMAX photography of the jumps themselves. Overall tho, v. cool."
5,Awesome,I first saw this movie at an IMAX theatre at the AIr & Space Museum in DC. I loved it then and I love it now too. It touches on some of the science involved in risk and also has gorgeous shots of different jumps. I recommend it to all of my friends and bought it just so I could show it to everybody.
4,Adrenaline Rush (IMAX) (2 - Disc WMVHD Edition) (2002),"Being the first WMVHD content disc I've purchased, I can't speak to how it might compare with other titles out there in this format, but it didn't disappoint and in fact it has inspired me to get back into skydiving. I did find it to be a little short in running time especially considering the little 'history of Adrenaline' segment which wasn't in keeping with the rest of the content. It's for these two reasons that I didn't give it a five star rating, but if you're after HD program content to play on your computer, and you don't suffer from vertigo, then this is an excellent choice."
2,Uninspired and uninvolving,"Lisa Goldstein has a good reputation in fantasy circles, but on the basis of this book I have to assume either that she is highly overrated or else that ""Summer King, Winter Fool"" is not particularly representative of her work as a whole. Some nice work in creating a promising setting and some intriguing ideas along the way are deep-sixed by a formulaic plot and characters who stubbornly refuse to come to life. Ms. Goldstein ignores the essential injunction to show, not tell, and the book hurries to its ending without creating the slightest tension along the way. Inexplicably recommended as one of the best fantasy novels of 1994 in Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's annual ""Year's Best"" anthology, which is normally a fairly reliable source for finding quality fantasy literature. Go figure."
1,YUCK!!!!!!,"I ordered this from my Gold Box last year and I thought I was getting a great buy since Kitchenaid has such a good reputation. This baster, however, is bad, bad, bad. I tried to baste my roast chicken at 400 degrees, and instantly the brush disintegrated! The only cool thing about that was watching the bristles sizzle and disappear before my eyes. I should've bought the baster from QVC which is made of silicone, and would withstand very high heat when basting. You should too!"
1,Bristles come out,I bought this brush based on the quality of the other KitchenAid tools I have. Even before I started using it the bristles started to come out.
2,Disappointing,"This bristle part of the pastry brush does melt as another reviewer pointed out. While using it to baste a turkey, the bristles dissolved instantly when they accidentally came in contact with the side of the roasting pan. In addition, the bristles also stain. I was using it to baste a pork roast with a maple syrup based sauce, and where the bristles meet the rest of the brush, about 1/2"" is stained an unappetizing shade of brown. I even tried to remove the stain by using the dishwasher, to no avail. I think I will probably throw it away."
2,Disappointed,"This was said to be a basting brush, but the nylon bristles melted when I used it to baste a turkey with the pan drippings. Even touching the side of a hot pan would melt the bristles. It may be fine for putting cold egg washes or even melted butter. Maybe I am not using it right, but I've had other brushes I could do this with."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I, like others, bought this brush on the reputation of the KitchenAid name. It is the only KitchenAid item I've ever bought that I was disappointed with. It is truly not worthy of the KitchenAid name. A very flimsy brush that disappoints from the first use."
1,melted on first use,"My wife picked it up on sale. Looks well made and is Kitchenaid, but doesn't look good after the fist use with the bristles all bent out of shape from the heat. I'll order a good silicone brush here on Amazon."
4,Older fellow,"Pretty good reference style book directed towards us older fellows. Sort of a medical common sense guide format. No, it doesn't include any miraculous age reducing chants but does let you know what to do to relieve some common ailments and also how to build your confidence while doing it. Helped me with my tussle with gout."
3,Not what I'd hoped it would be,"After reading the ""All Together In One Place"", I was expecting a lot more from the Tender Ties series. It's not that they aren't particularly good, they're just not as good as the others of Jane Kirkpatrick's that I've read. The timelines are a little harder to follow because they sometimes skip ahead months and even years. Like I said, it's not that these aren't good books, they just aren't quite what I've come to expect from her."
5,The best of them all,"I've read every one of Jane Kirkpatrick's books so far, and it's always hard to wait for the next one to come out. ""A Name Of Her Own"" is the best of all."
1,Don't sell your old badly-written books,"I recently got into Lisa Unger and read a lot of her books which are very unusual, well-written and frankly creepy in a good way. I wasn't aware that this book and Angel Fire were re-releases of books when she apparently wrote before she developed her writing skills. They were both so awful after a few pages I closed them and gave them away (to someone I don't like that much). Sorry, Ms. Unger but I think when someone writes as good as you do now, it is a rip off to sell your old crap just because you are famous now."
4,Book 3 - Better than Book 2,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Slightly left of centre with curses and underground culture. Certainly keeps you reading well into the night
2,"poor plot, poorly conceived","Writing as Lisa Miscione in her Lydia Strong novels, Lisa Unger seems to abandon those interesting and varied writing skills that she uses when she writes as Lisa Unger."
1,"Just an aquarium, NOT a Coral Reef","I bought this expecting videography of actual Coral Reefs, but found only video of a Saudi Arabian Aquarium."
4,A consistent favorite...,A consistent favorite of our 18 month old over the last several months. More durable than some of the other lift-the-flap books.
5,My 3 children all loved this book when they were babies..,"From about 9 months on they are interested in the animals, being able to open and close the flaps. It is best read with sounds accompanying each animal (i.e. hissing for snakes). Great way to spark their interest in reading."
3,"Cute book, but all the zoo animals are male","As a mommy to a little girl, I've become a bit more sensitive. This book is very cute, but all of the animals sent to the child are male (Lion, he was too fierce. Camel, he was too grumpy, etc).The book itself is a good quality, just have small issue with the content."
5,Fun board book,My 2 year old still loves this book. He first encountered this book at the library when he was a little over 1 year old. He loves flipping up the flaps that reveal each animal. Great book to introduce to toddlers.
5,Dear Zoo,"Thoroughly enjoyed by babies & toddlers. They love the lift-the-flap concept long before they understand the ""plot"" making it great to use with a lapful of kids or grandkids!"
3,Animals,"Each animal arriving from the zoo as a possible pet fails to suit its prospective owner, until just the right one is found. Movable flaps reveal the contents of each package."
2,"A very cute story, but book was defective and of poor quality","I used to read this to my niece when she was a kid many years ago, and she loved it. We'd enjoy opening the flaps and talking about the animals behind each flap. I bought this intending to give it as a gift to a friend (and got the mini edition so I could mail it to her), but even though the story is the same, this mini-edition is flimsy and the one I received was defective. The flap on the third page was improperly glued and tore the page. In my 10 years of shopping at Amazon I've never had to return anything, but will do with this book since I'd be embarrassed to give it as a gift! I'm buying the regular edition (board book) instead despite its bigger size."
1,caution with adopted children,"As a mother of an adopted child and a psychologist, I am concerned about the message this book sends. The child in the book wants a pet, but because they are unacceptable, he repeatedly sends them back. I want my daughter to know that nothing about her is unacceptable, and nothing could ever make me want to ""send her back."" The book may be great for children in other situations, but I think it sends the wrong message to adopted children."
5,Everyday read!,I just bought this book for my 22 month old daughter. She LOVES it! We have read this book everyday since I gave it to her. She is also very careful with lift the flaps which could be a problem with some toddlers.
5,SO CUTE!,this book is so cute and my daughter loves the flaps to see the animal inside! Also makes a great gift :)
4,Lift the flaps,and reveal a different animal each time. I am reading it to my 2-month old baby and I hope he will like it for a long time.
2,disappointed,i bought two of these books at $9.93@ to go along with christmas zoo membership gifts. so very disappointed when they arrived and were really tiny...absolutely not worth the price. how disappointing! never paid attention to book sizes before but certainly will from now on!
4,Small but cute,I don't know why I assumed this was a full size book but it isn't. It's a very tiny little book but it will work for the price.
1,Good idea bad book,"My baby loves flap books, however, here the flaps are too small and the items are uninteresting. He doesn't care at all about this book compared to other flap books we have."
4,"Fun, Interactive","We love this book in our house and our toddler has requested it continually for the past year. We love all of the flaps that open with the animal inside. One of the pages states ""Then they sent me a camel, but he was too grumpy, so I sent him back."" Now our toddler will say he's grumpy like a camel if he's in a bad mood. Funny! I recommend this book."
4,Stephanie's Gift,This looks like a great book for a small child. We are giving this to our Great Niece for Christmas.
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my 3 month old son for Christmas. He is a little young for the flaps, but the book is durable and VERY cute. Great for little ones."
5,Great lift-the-flap book!,"This book is not only interesting for my toddler daughter, it is very sturdy as well. The flaps are very well constructed and have withheld the test of time from when she was only 6 months old. This book was also a great book for her to learn the names of animals through anticipation. We both love this book!"
4,My kids love this book.,This is a great book and possibly a classic. The kids love to open up the flaps revealing the animals on each page AND amazingly they haven't ripped them off yet!
5,Favorite Book,"My 15 month old has loved books for many months and this book is still his favorite book. We could read it 10 times in a row and he will cry when I am ""all done"". I wish the flap for the lion's cage was a little bit more sturdy as I don't see that lasting forever, not with a toddler. Otherwise it is a perfect book in his eyes!!"
3,Flimsy flaps,"Granted our 10 month old likes this book but we were a little disappointed when it arrived and the exploring flaps are just paper, not a sturdier cardboard. Also the flaps are hard for her to open on her own so we have to start the flap and she then opens it the rest of the way. She can get a bit rough with the flaps and we have to be on guard so they don't rip. So far so good."
4,Super cute,"The paper engineering in this book is very cute and easy enough for my 10-month-old daughter to work on her own. The prose is minimal, but that's just fine, as the point of this book appears to be the illustrations and pop-ups."
3,"whhops, READ description :) this sucker is the MINI version",my fault for not realizing this was a MINI version - its tiny.. the book itself is cute but i think the flaps might fall off sooner than later...
4,"cute book, a little too small","This story itself is very cute. It is very small, so the pages are a little flimsy. I'm scarred the picture flaps may tear easily if the child using it is not gentle. Other than that, it's very cute."
5,Loved for a long time,"Books pass in and out of favor with my toddler, but this has been favorite for a long time. She will listen to it over and over again. Loves to lift the flaps and language is short and simple. Great for babies and young toddlers."
4,Original version is better,"The pop-up version is good, but the original, lift-the-flap version is better, in my opinion. Dear Zoo is one of the best read-aloud stories I've come across. As a children's librarian, when I'm running around at the last minute looking for storytime books, I can always grab Dear Zoo. No matter what age group I've got, no matter how many times they've already heard the story, they always love Dear Zoo."
1,I Can't read a book about landing on the moon when I know man did not land or walk on the moon,"I really really wish we went to the moon.When I first heard we didn't go to the moon,I couldn't believe it. Now after looking intoit, I now know we didn't go. So, I won't buy abook about going to the moon when I know wedid not go."
3,bad for street level detail,"this gps unit is pretty much useless for car navigation-- it showed me a block from where i was standing, on another street, past a creek that doesn't exist! (in south florida, using usa streets and destinations).what the $#%% is the point of a GPS if it doesnt even show you where you are? it embarassed the hell out me when i was showing it off. you can only imagine.in terms of hiking on trails and wooded areas and whatnot, i cant judge because i didnt test that aspect before i returned it, but im sure its great."
1,Dog with fleas,On my second unit and this one just went bad. Not much else to say ither than very frustrated with Magellan customer service.
1,Magellan Roadmate 3000T - Stay away,I purchased a Roadmate 300T in April. In August the units batteries would not charge. I called the Technical Support and was told to send it in to the RA Center in Ft. Worth. I sent it in and never heard back from Magellan. I've called Technical Support 15 times and I'm told something different each time. I was told today that they don't have the software to even determine the status of the unit. All they can do is tell you that thay are working on your unit. They don't have access the the repair center to determine what is realy going on with your unit. Stay away from Magellan.
1,Terrible product,"The Meridian Platinum sucks up battery power quickly. Does not usually last beyond 8 hours, whether using regular batteries or rechargeables. This happens without using the backlight and without a lot of screen changes. Secondly, the Mapsend software is 6 years out of date, 6 YEARS! Requests to Thales for assistance goes unanswered. Have sent 6 emails, received no replies. Their new 3D software uses the same maps, 6 years out of date. I would recommend any manufacturer in the world but these people. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PRODUCT, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY DON'T CARE ONCE THEY'VE SOLD THEIR PRODUCT."
3,Didn't last very long.,I bought one of these in June of 2003 and it went bad in November. It started shutting itself off after being on only a few seconds. I have returned it to the manufacturer for repair.
3,Disappointed!,"I have not read it yet, but my husband is adopted and we are adopting a little girl... he picked up the book to read it...read 3-4 pages and put it down. He chose another book to read??"
2,Read with care,"The good thing about this book is the details offered about Castro's interventions all over the world; however the reader must exercise great caution since the book is unabashedly partisan and these very same details are distorted to support the Castro message, and malign his enemies. Interestingly enough the details of the war in Cuba support my memories of those events, although ""battles"" is mistranslated to describe all military actions however small. Cowardice of the Marianas reported by such as Norberto Fuentes (see below), and is not consistent with my memories that recall these women as being irrationally brave, but such is the fog of war. On the other hand Puebla portrays a courageous Castro an exaggeration of reality, since his caution and discrete retirement from the battle field is legendary.Fuentes, Norberto 2004 La Autobiografia de Fidel Castro (Paperback). Destino Ediciones, Barcelona ISBN: 9707490012 pp. 852-853."
4,One of her better Romance-Only Books,I prefer her suspense novels like Montana Sky. I do really like the trillogies - especially the Born In series. I enjoy when the characters are brought back in other books. That way you get to keep enjoying the other people. I really like the MacGregors. The old man is hilarious and I love all his matchmaking. I love that the family really loves each other and cares about the other family members. The MacGregor series definitely makes you feel good.
3,The Book for Some but Not Others,"""The MacGregor Grooms"" features three stories of The MacGregor three grandsons: D.C., Duncan and Ian. He had found suitable brides for these three grandsons of his. The ladies were all from good, strong stock, as The MacGregor always said.For D.C.'s story, it started with The MacGregor asking D.C. to escort Layna to a charity ball.For Duncan's part, he was recommended a singer, Cat, for his gambling boat, the Princess.As for Ian's story, he was asked by The MacGregor to pick up a few books at the Brightstone Books where he met the full partner and vice president of the bookstore, Naomi.The stories in this volume consist of pure, sweet romance. The characters were all perfect, that is, handsome/beautiful and rich and from good families. It will be a good read only for those who love perfect love stories. Others can drop this read."
4,Pleasant surprise,"I've read most of Nora Roberts' books and enjoyed a fare share of them. I tried to read all of the MacGregor series, but by the time I got to the Grooms, I got bored with the predictability of the story. I'd just finished the second part (Duncan), quite disappointed, and wasn't looking forward all that much to the next set of perfect, confident, brilliant, strong characters. Then comes Naomi. For the very first time Nora Roberts introduced me to a female character that I could truly identify with - completely down to earth, worried about her diet and her weight, trying to be good at what she does but not overly confident, searching for her inner beauty and her identity, shy..., she's actually blushing and stuttering and mumbling. I was charmed, and intrigued. For the life of me, I could not suppress the giggles or the tears. Here's to a diamond in the rough."
2,Boring,"I was very disappointed with this book. I usually like Nora Roberts' books, but I was bored with this one. Nothing exciting happens with the love story. I didn't really care what happened with these characters, and I found Daniel MacGregor very annoying."
2,silly,Is anyone beside me getting tired of the McGregors? I don't mind books about other family members but story after story after story about the same family members and now a re-issue of the beginning of the same family is a bit much. I feel this is just a money-grubbing effort that takes very little work on the author's part. I like The Reef and I just finished River's End so I am a fan of Nora Roberts but I will not buy anything more that says anything about the McGregors.
2,A disapointing follow-up,"I really enjoyed the wit of Macgregor Brides. It was one of the sweetest, yet well written romances that I have read in recent years and was looking forward to continuing with the series. The Macgregor Grooms was nowhere near as entertaining!It seemed that Nora Roberts was following a formula and simply plugged in names in a set of events that varies only mildly from vignette to vignette. She borrows too much from the previous book as well. Somehow the grandfather seemed more pushy and less doting here as well!Not really worth your time."
1,This family is too perfect to be real,"I recently read both the MacGregor Brides & Grooms, and that was ENOUGH for me! These people are just too good to be true, all gorgeous, ivy-league educated, to the manor born and brought together in marriage by their 90-something patriarch Daniel Duncan MacGregor(he must be pushing 100 by now). Old Daniel is the ultimate meddling, busybody grandfather who means well but pushes prospective mates on everyone in his family, God forbid someone decides to pass on marriage and family and be on their own! These two books were it for me, and I think I'll stick to the other Nora Roberts stories I've always enjoyed over the years. This series is too much!"
5,Nora is becoming my fav author!!!!,"""The MacGregor Grooms"" was a great book. However, I do like ""The MacGregor Brides"" better. This book was easy to read and follow. My favorite story was Ian and Naomi. Unlike the other stories, Naomi wasn't born beautiful. She was pudgy, insecure and shy. Ian convinces her otherwise. I can hardly wait to read ""The Winning Hand"", and ""Serena and Caine."" She has a great talent for writing, and I haven't read one of hers yet that I didn't like."
5,Naomi-Ian,"I loved the Naomi-Ian story. The reason why I liked this story in particular was because the characters are basically nice, likable (likeable?) people. Sure, Nora Roberts makes the MacGregor's lives too good to be true, and it is a fairy tale in that respect. But, really, the good thing about these characters is that they want the same thing everybody else in life wants, or most people in life want. They just want to share their life with somebody and have children, and enjoy nice things. It's really as simple as that. I liked this story because it just promoted the simple, basic things people like in life. The characters weren't flashy or overly philosophical. They were just fundamentally good people. A lot of times you don't feel like rooting for certain characters in stories because they are mean, or the book makes it look cool to be mean, but in this story, I felt that I could really vote for the main characters. A nice read."
2,Pure Fluff...what a disappointment,What a bunch of fluff. The short length required to fit three stories into 1 volume is not long enough to delve into the characters. Her recent recented The Winning Hand about the oldest grandson was much better because she was able to use 200+ pages to develop the story. The situations seemed contrived. Read the book in the bookstore...don't buy...
4,Love and Marriage go together like a ...............,This book and the MacGregor Brides portray small town American life and love from the perspective of a large and loving family.
5,Once again...,"Nora Roberts has done it! I can never seem to get enough of her books. The MacGregor series are absolutely wonderful. Of course, they all end happy, but not before some kind of stone being thrown. The MacGregor would be a welcomed addition to my family if I wasn't already married to the best man ::smile Looking forward to the next in the series"
5,A masterful book,"I can thoroughly recommend this book to everyone, even those who have gone digital. John talks about how and why he has made a photograph and also discusses the Zone system. The zone system has always been a bit hard for a lot of people to follow but I think John has made it more accessable. The point is even if you are a Digital photographer the same principles apply.The rest of the book deals on ""seeing"" and ""reasons"" to make a photograph, also on burning and dodging, which is just the same in Photoshop as it is in the Darkroom. John is one of the Worlds finest teachers and photographers and this book should be on every photographers bookshelf. Even if you only just look at the pictures."
3,Dependent on your tastes,"This book is similar to Ansel Adams' Making of 20 photographs in some ways, but Blakemore's images are more pictorial than Adams' and he focuses more on what he was thinking than how he made the exposures. There are almost no technical details, but plenty of insight into the creative process Blakemore uses to make his images, with a basic introduction of the Zone system for good measure. Personaly, I could not get past the images, which are too soft and abstract for my tastes, to really connect with his though process.If you think you would be interested in seeing into Mr. Blakemores' mind while he formulates these images, AND you like his soft focus style, you might enjoy this book. If you prefer more defined images, or are looking for more technical information on how the images were made, you will not find what you are looking for here. This book seems less of a workshop and more of a chat session with the photographer."
2,Bad layout- an unforgivable sin,"With expectation I opened my copy, only to find that, yes, all the tech details were spot on, concise and well argued, but that the haphazard layout was an affront to the subject matter. Illustrations relating to body text were often on the following page, or preceding. The same catalogue numerical system was used in each section so that it becomes twice as confusing searching for a picture reference with the same number as an unrelated illustration on the page currently being read.Confused already?Save the money on a new copy, buy a used edition JUST for the excellent data.The editors and publishers should hang their collective heads and the designer should be made to actually USE the book objectively to see where he/she have blundered so appallingly"

4,"""Case of the Missing Cookies""","""Case of the Missing Cookies"", by Denise Lewis Patrick portrays a story of two young cousins who go on a search of the cookies missing from their cookie jars. They follow a trail of crumbs to find the culprit. Along the way, they come across the possible suspects: the baby, Dad, Mom, Ranger Mike, Abuelo, Shaina, and eventually they make it to the cookie snatcher.The illustrations of this book were colorful and exciting, and went along well with the story line. However, the book was rather repetitive, and got a little bit boring. Children would enjoy the fact that the cookie snatcher has make-believe features. We recommend this book for children under 5, because anyone older may get bored with the amount of repetition."
4,Expressing African Culture,"The Case of the Missing Cookies, by Denise Lewis Patrick, portrays the story of two children and their search for their father's cookies. Illustrator, Stacey Schuett, uses bright colors and designs to convey the author's idea of African culture and heritage.The illustrations in this book make use of the colors traditionally seen in African attire and decoration. The text alone does not express African culture in a way that the reader would be able to identify. It is a major accomplishment of Schuett to be able to express the true feelings of African background through her pictures. Colors such as red, yellow, and green, when used together in designs, often give the viewer a sense of this culture. Schuett combines these colors on everyday objects, such as a tire swing, a pottery bowl, wallpaper, and the characters' clothing. Through this combination of colors, Schuett honors African heritage to the reader."
4,A piece of CBR history,Priceless to those of us who study pedigrees in depth. Invaluable to my breeding program.With Chesapeakes being my breed of choice I was delighed to get this addition to add to my CBR titles which include fact as well as fiction.Unfortunatly many of the pictures are very dark and hard to make out and the copies could have been better for all the information pages.Shannon
1,"Lame, very lame","It's time to give up. Lame when singing and worse when talking, please go away and let talent go on alone without you."
1,a really bad singer from the 60's tries to revive her career,"Joni was one of the big bad 3(the others are Patti Page & Teresa Brewer), these gals were horrible middle of the road pop singers. This is Joni's worst cd yet, she sounds about 85, and what's with the sweedish accent, if you must buy Joni get her Let There be love cd, at least it's so bad it's good in a campy sort of way, she sounds like a 13 year old in love, on that classic late 50's lp..., but the her latest is awful!!"
1,Awful!,"I sat in disbelief as I watched this film. Macy has proven such afine actor in so many other films, but was completely wrong forthis part. His delivery was totally flat and unconvincing. He justwasn't right for the character. As for the ending, it couldn't havebeen any less ironic or ridiculous. No subtlty or believabilitywhatsoever. For movies addressing the same subject matter, seeTaxi Driver, Falling Down, and Fight Club. They are better moviesand the actors do a much better job at fulfilling their respectiveroles."
1,TWO WORDS: UN WATCHABLE,"Being that this film is a David Mamet creation, I had high hopes going in. Let's just say that by minute five, my hopes were in a Michael Richards-esque decline."
1,"What in the world, done with American film","Negative one stars. I have seen bad movies; bad acting, no plot, etc, etc. This one is bad and disturbing, disgusting. I like Macy as an actor, now everytime I see him, I will think of this film. Really, puts a sour taste in your mouth. This is up there with Michael Richards' recent outburst."
1,"Yuck. Not ""Mamet"" as you now think of him.","The DVD box is very misleading. The actresses all have small roles, though Stiles is great and beautiful in her short appearance. There is no handgun in this movie; it's only pictured on the DVD box to make it look more interesting.Macy's acting is not as great as other reviewers claim; he seemed to keep his long rant at the same intensity for most of the movie. I didn't buy into his character's extreme actions. As another reviewer put it, this movie is more of an assault. It should have been rated NC-17.This is not Glengarry Glen Ross, nor is it Spartan, The Spanish Prisoner, or The Winslow Boy. It's not even About Last Night."
1,Terrible movie,"I watched this movie recently and was looking around to see if there were any decent arguments about how this is in any way a movie worth watching. So far I have not found any. On positive reviews I see comments about how the movie is ""dark"". If you want to see a ""dark"" movie go see something else. About a third to halfway through the film this thing goes totally off the rails and becomes an incoherent mess. This movie is terribly written and the main character's actions are totally unconvincing. And to those that say he's mentally imbalanced that may be true but his behavior at the beginning and ending of the movie make no sense to his behavior through the rest of it because the script and the acting do not allow the audience to understand his motivations. Bottom line, this movie is totally absurd. It's not ""dark"", it's terrible."
1,This isn't Mamet...,"...it's Neil Labute lite, with a bad hair-weave and no teeth.It's racist, repulsive, pointless, and, although it's only 82 minutes, it may seem like 82 hours before it's over.A couple times I paused the film and asked myself if I REALLY wanted to go on...once because of the gore (implied but bloody nonetheless) and once because I was simply asking myself if I was being entertained or being assaulted.It ain't no Glengarry Glen Ross, that's for sure.This disgusting little piece of trash deserves to simply fade into memory, if you care to remember it at all, and join the dozens of others on the rack at the front of the rental store that are being sold 5 for 20 bucks or whatever.Although it isn't worth even that much.One big thumbs down!"
4,Oh that Edmond,"Wow...what can I say about this film, Macy is amazing but what else is new, the cast is incredible and the look and feel of the film is stunning, it looks like they shot in New York but it was made in LA, bravo to whoever found them ;)"
5,"Practical, Sensible Help","This work will be helpful for all who go through a divorce as it provides insight from the author, but allows for reader response as well. It is written from a Christian perspective and from one who has gone down the path of divorce .The interactive nature of 'Passage' allows time for reflection in each chapter. It can be of great encouragement to one going through this crisis. Well written, well organized material."
1,does not recharge,The battery worked 1 time. I tried to recharge and it does not charge. Total Waste of money! This is not a rechargeable battery.
5,great product,Had one for about 5 years and it lasted longer than any battery I'd ever used before having to recharge. when I lost that one I knew there was only one choice but this time I ordered 2 to have a backup. It would last 5 or 6 days of constant picture taking during a week in Disney.
3,Buy with caution!,"I bought these for my Z8612IS and couldn't be happier. I recorded an hour of video and took 80+ photos (no flash) and the low battery light never came on. Don't cheap out and get a generic or ""other"" brand... get the real deal from Kodak!=====A little over a year later: Had to send these back to Kodak for replacement. They will no longer take a charge. Too much money for too little performance life."
2,Doen't work for my camera and states it works for a 712 IS,"Don't know if the charger is bad or the battery I bought with it, but does not work with my camera and it states for a 712 IS."
2,dissapointed,I was surprised that a NEW battery was not in the original package and i had 2 charge it to give it power.
1,Kodak Battery,"Kodak 8324154 KLIC-8000 Li-Ion Rechargeable Digital Camera BatteryHorrible: The batterys do NOT hold a charge. After @ 2 weeks in the camera, they lost all the charge. The same type batterys that came with my camera hold their charge for many months."
3,Make sure it works with your camera!,"I really thought that this would work with my Kodak CX7000 series camera, but it didn't.Make sure it is compatible before you buy!"
3,Battery Life ?,"I followed the initial charge instructions as directed. However, the first time I used the camera the battery was dead by the end of the day. :("
1,Short life,After about 6 months of use the battery stopped keeping a charge. It was charged about 15 times total. Want keep charge over night.Li-ion batteries go bad with age.It must have been a old battery when I purchased it.
1,unsatisfied,"Receiving not receving notices as to the order's progress and waiting a week, I decided to call the company, Adorama Camera Inc. They were very sorry but the item had not been sent but they would do so immediately. After another week an email informed me that the item could not be sent and that I was getting a refund. I guess I should be happy that the refund went through with no problem."
3,It's good to recharge instead of buying batteries all the time.,"I bought this for a Kodak 712Z it works, but doesn't last long. At least it can be recharged."
5,The battery was exactly the one required for my camera.,Dealing with Adorama Camera was a great experience. The battery arrived in good time and was as ordered.
5,"Great Service, Fast Shipment","At first I was a little disappointed because when my battery arrived it had a tiny slice over the top of the plastic allowing the battery to slide out (possibly a returned idem, second or refurb). I wrote the company a couple days later when I received an email from Amazon asking if Shipment arrived without error. I wasn't expecting much but the VERY next day I reveive an email with a conformation number that my NEW order has shipped and that there was no charge.. exactly 2 days later I received a factory sealed battery and an invoice showing paid in full. Thanks Adorama Camera, now that was awesome service!!Pat BGlenwood, IL"
3,A bit Pricey!,Im using this battery on my Kodak Z1012 IS. The life of this battery when fully charged is the same as AA energizer lithium. It's a bit Pricey! Im hoping that energizer will make a better substitute on this!
5,"Genuine Kodak, The way to go!","I have a Kodak Z712IS Camera and G600 Dock, The only Rechargeable Battery I would use was a Kodak KLIC-8000. I looked at the other replacements that were cheaper, I looked at the usual retailers, I found this was the best deal. I have recharged it several times in the dock, it lasted 3 days, about 240 pictures on the last charge. Thanks Folks!"
3,Charger doesn't work properly.,The batteries were fine but the charger doesn't work unless the battery is held in place with a C-clamp. I emailed the supplier but they never responded.
4,GREAT,My camera is able to take more pictures with this battery. The other ones didnt last no more than a couple of hours.
4,Very Good Product,I've travel plan on weekend with my Kodak Digital Camera.I'm not worried for battery because I've new battery from Amazon.Thank you for the best product and support.
2,doesn't fit rapid charger,"I bought the Kodak Digital Camera Battery Charger K8500 -C+1 and extra KLIC-8000 battery. The battery pack I purchased separately does not fit the rapid charger! It just falls out, I have to tape it down to hold it in place! I do not know yet how long these batteries will hold a charge. My experience in the past is at first they work great and then with age (6 months or so) they will no longer hold a charge. I wish Kodak and other manufacturers could fix this problem."
5,ordering on amazon. com rocks!!,"I was unable to locate this battery in the stores near me--wal mart, walgreen, best buy. I was very happy to find it on amazon.com and at a very reasonable price. I will return when I need to replace the battery. My first order on-line was very simple and it arrived very quickly."
5,great purchase,Got tired of purchasing regular batteries because I didnt have a charger or rechargeable batteries. Now I have both. Thanks.
5,Great Battery-- holds charge pretty well!,Great battery for a great price! Seems to hold its charge for quite a while too!
5,good battery,"This batter is a standard Lithium Ion rechargeable battery to replace the non-rechargeable version. Nothing special, just charge it up and there you have it."
1,Non working,Ordered this battery for my past family runion and was not able to use it b/c the battery cause my camera to get hot and not function. I didn't find out it wasn't a properly working battery until after the 30 day return policy. WILL NOT use this vendor again. THANKS!
5,Good Camera Battery,If you need a good rechargeable camera battery I would strongly recommend this Li-Ion. I purchased several because I take a lot of digital photos and this battery has never let me down.
5,Kodak Rechargeable Digital Camera Battery,This rechargeable battery is not easy to find in the stores. I had no problem once I went on Amazon. Price was comparable and shipping extremely fast.
1,Awful sound quality,"September SongThe audio samples here on Amazon tell the story - they're an accurate representation of what's the disc: shrill, distorted, no bass. Unlistenable."
5,good cheap system,I bought the car system about a week ago this is a very good buy easy to install great sound and most of all a great price i would tell anybody to buy it and with a name like panasonic you cant go wrong....
1,Nielsen undermined,"Flutist Lisa Hansen royally butchers this flute masterpiece. I remember the glorious one now out of print on CBS label with Julius Baker. Hansen's tone sounds like screaching at best, with sloppy facility and terrible intonation. She shows no sense of style or panache, rather she plods through like a rambling steer. This style of flute playing is far better suited to the circus, than to classical music."
4,"Great fun, don't just get one!","I purchased three of these for Christmas after seeing them on a recently released children's movie in the theater. These are great mindless fun. My favorite maneuver is to sneek up on someone who is half awake at the breakfast table and nail them from 15 feet away. You do need to use the sights on this to be accurate. This is NOT an educational toy, but it is great alternative to toys that shoot real projectiles.Have fun!"
1,Who doesn't live in a pineapple???,"My 2 year old son likes to be inside stuff... He also LOVES Spongebob so I thought this would be perfect for him. Well, I bought it and brought it home and set it up and I was right... He loved it! However, about every 2 seconds it fell over and I had to keep standing it back up. There are only metal supports on 2 sides and there are plastic poles on the top and top sides. I packed it back up and returned it and we purchased the school house, which so totally rocks! Get the school house, or the firehouse... get anything but Spongebob!"
5,Great and original one of a kind mambo music!!,Perez Prado is a great composer and musician. His Latin flair and style make this album the best out there. He is truly the mambo king of his era and today's. If you want good music buy it now!!!
4,haven't watched it myself,I bought it as a gift for a 3 year old boy who is obsessed with helicopters. His mom told me he realy enjoys it and it is a good DVD.
2,Fluff Fluff and more Fluff.,"An Imax fluff piece with very little sense of content. Little dialog or explanation of anything. The ""making of"" was more interesting than the show but it too had little content. Worth about a 1/3 of its price. Even with the big Imax screen there would not be much there, there, if you know what I mean."
4,Great For Helicopter Careers,"This DVD is a great sampling if you're interested in helicopters and/or the type of career opportunities they offer. There's a great sequence servicing high-power lines, some logging action from the Pacific Northwest, and a basic flying lesson! This was originally an IMAX film, so the quality is very good. No, it's not screaming helicopter action, because it shows you the real world of what helicopters are mostly used for. I also recommend checking out the bonus features, there's even better stuff in there."
3,cool views of helocopters in flight,a pretty good video but a little short for my liking.It was about forty minutes if I remember correctly. It features about twelve or thirteen different helopters and some of the different jobs they can do. There are some pretty neat action shots but not the best aviation video I have seen. There are also some good bonus features that explain more about some of the jobs featured in the video.
5,awesome,"This movie was above my expectations. It is an IMAX movie so right off the bat it is crystal clear scenery. It has a wonderful story, nice narration, and my 4 year old and husband loved it both. For the record I did too! I would recommend it to anyone into helicopters, or just looking for a educational movie."
2,Flakes off.,"I've been searching for a mascara ever since the one I was using was discontinued. This one was almost good. The wand is a great shape, and the mascara went on smoothly. It didn't make my eyes itch-which is good, as many cosmetics make my eyes itch. The only problem was that the mascara didn't stay put. It would smear or flake at the slightest touch. I could correct the raccoon eyes quickly, as the mascara isn't waterproof-but it wasn't worth the hassle and worry."
3,Nice product but not for redheads,"L'Oreal FeatherLash Softly Sweeping Mascara, True Brown is a nice product but as a pale redhead it looked jet black on me. The only mascara that I have found to work is sold at [...] I wished they offered their products through amazon. It would make my shopping a lot easier."
1,"watery, smudgy, NOT water resistant","This mascara is so watery and smudge-prone, it seems as if it never fully dries. 90% of the time, I have to correct stray marks after putting it on, even if I'm oh-so-careful not to blink, and have sometimes had to wash my face and start from scratch because of out-of-control smudging. Forget about even touching your eye for the rest of the day - it'll smudge even 8 hours after application. And it still causes my lashes to stick together."
4,Loreal Featherlash,"The Water Resistant Featherlash mascara is the best I've ever used of any kind. Unfortunately, this is the non-water resistant kind, but hopefully it will hold up well. I was disappointed to receive it as the Amazon window did not specify this and I had searched specifically for waterproof. The seller was very nice and offered to take the item back for a re-stocking fee but it just wasn't worth it to send it back. This is not the first time I've been frustrated with the Amazon product search and I will be reluctant to buy from it again. All in all, good seller, not so good Amazon. Non-water proof Featherlash, we'll see."
3,"Sounds good - NOT DVD AUDIO, though. This is a DTS CD","Amazon has this in the DVD audio category and even says in the description, ""This is a DVD-Audio disc which is playable on most DVD players as well as all DVD-Audio players.""This is NOT A DVD AUDIO DISC. It is a surround sound CD. Very smooth, mostly relaxing jazzy sounds are on this album, however, and the recordings are, for the most part, excellent. No complaints there. I bought a used version in great condition."
5,Words really do have meaning!,"In this slender, but powerful work, the great (and often overlooked) Thomistic scholar Josef Pieper sends out a call to arms against ""every partisan simplification, every ideological agitation, every blind emotionality . . . [and] well-turned yet empty slogans . . ."" He pulls no punches in taking on those modern (and ancient) sophists who rape and pillage language in order to obtain political power and cultural currency. He also takes on modern advertising, noting that we live in an age and culture where ""what is decisive is not what you say, but how you say it."" In an era of politically-correct pap, vapid mantras and bumper-sticker philosophy, this book sends a clear, clean note of truth into the murky darkness of a deafened and confused populace."
1,Caution...,"I bought this game, as I had downloaded a demo of it back in 1999 and was very impressed with the demo. I have a new Dell computer with 1.7 Ghz processor and Windows XP. I have been discovering the hard way that many, if not most games that came out before Windows XP (my current operating system) are totally incompatible with Windows XP. Superbike 2000 is no exception. I even visited the EA Sports website and contacted technical support and they provided no answers. In fact, the tech support personnel, themselves, attempted to run the game on XP and they told me that they were unable to.I wanted to purchase Superbike 2001 as well, so I asked EA tech support if that, too, didn't run under Windows XP and they told me that it didn't, also."
1,comfortable but worthless,"While I would agree that these earplugs are fairly comfortable, they barely keep out any sound. They might be nice for a workplace if you want to take the edge off of very loud sound but if you want to experience something closer to silence then you'll be sorely disappointed. I'm still looking for the right earplugs to help with sleep and exam taking. I bought 12 pairs of these and I'm throwing most of them away....The title is close, it should be Quite Disposable Earplugs!"
2,1/3 Noise Reduction,I purchased these earplugs for nightly sleep. I live in a condo on a busy street. I tried some earplugs similar to these previously that worked great. These aren't so great. They only block about 1/3 of the noise. I would shop around and find something more effective to block out noise.
5,amazing,i only write reviews for cds that i absolutly love. this cd is brilliant. ive only listened to it once i would have to say this is my new fav band and cd. every song is amazing i would recomend this cd to any who enjoys good music!!!
3,The redhead returns,I vividly remember when Susan Hayward returned to Hollywood in the early 1970's after she had escaped to aquamarine waters of the Florida straits fishing for marlin. She came on strong and appeared in televison films like this one and another Barbara Stanwyck reject and things looked grand. But she could not overcome the plight of a tumor of the brain. She supposedly received the seed of this disease at the 1955 hydrogen bomb test site on the insiduous set of The Conqueror with John Wayne.This television movie gave Susan's fans a last look at this great Golden Era Hollywood legend. It is indeed a treasure.God love her.
5,Don't think you could buy a better 12/3 cord,"I bought this cord for my Earthwise 12 amp lawnmower. With 15 amp capability it's nice to know it is more than adequate to the task for my mower. Previously, before I knew amps from watts, I was using a 16/3 cord. This cord was absolutely no more difficult to move around, and possibly even easier as a little more weight made it easier to ""throw"". I winds up easily and cleanly on theAlert Stamping 7000WR Pro-Reel Cord Carrier. Nice to be reminded by the light on the female end that you have a live wire in your hands if you are going to unplug it from the mower before you unplug it from the wall!"
4,Yellow Jacket,"This is a monster of an extension cord. We use it to run power heavy tools at a distance. Works like a charm every time. The lit ends help me see whether or not we have power. It is bulky and heavy, but worth it."
5,"Well-made, great product",Product received and looks great and well-made. The cord does seem to be very durable and will hold up to just about anything.
4,Solid,Nice beefy cord that holds up to my occasional abuse. Doesn't tangle excesively but is a bit heavy if that's a concern. Delivered on-time and in perfect condition.
5,Hard to imagine a better cord,I use several of these cords to power heavy tools in my shop and in my home during a power outage. They can carry a heavy electrical load - the lighted end is a great feature and they resist getting tangled up unlike cheaper cords. You can buy cheaper cords but do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks for a high quality product that will serve you well for many years.
5,Good extension cord,I like the lighted ends on the cord that tell you when it's pluged in. This is just what I needed for running my electric lawn mower and and demanding tools.
3,No lifetime warranty.,"Like any product, what you really want is a well-built product; but it also helps if the product has a good company behind it in case of failures. Yellow Jacket used to have a great Lifetime Warranty and a company to stand behind it. Yes, it was made overseas, but made well. Now its made in the USA, by Coleman Cable, and no more lifetime warranty. As for the quality of the product, you would have to be the judge of that. My 2 cents is that there has been some shortcuts, and I now question the validity of paying $50-$100 for an extension cord that will surely die in a few years, with no warranty behind it. Remember: Coleman Cable/Yellow Jacket only has a one year warranty on any and all of its products, including older products. Call Customer Service if you want to verify. Not worth the price in my book."
5,old school metal done right!,"I thought i was the only one that thought the ""Porpoise song"" was magnificent..until i read some of these reviews! The guitar interplay in the 2nd half of the song should be a textbook lesson on how it's done! 'Hear the Earth""..""The Eye""...the atmospheric ""Requiem"" and the killer cover of ""Tomorrow never Knows"" make this the best cd in Trouble's catalog. If you are remotely into Metal..you need this cd!"
4,take it out for clean cycle!!!,"This thermometer worked great until I forgot to remove it for the clean cycle (which is totally my fault, instructions say to remove it when cleaning the oven). It turned brassy and the label was bleached out, so I threw it away.Prior to the mishap it worked as promised. All I really needed to know was how long it takes my oven to preheat (a lot longer than the oven thinks it needs). Now that I know this I don't need the thermometer anymore.Two minor gripes: 1) if you hang it in the front of the oven, it gets in the way of larger pans and baking sheets, and 2) if you hang it in the back of the oven its hard to read."
1,Flips over easily,Bought this for shore dive and it is very difficult to tow. The wind picked up and I lost the flag. I think it would be ok to tie this off at the lake for OW course but not much use in the ocean where the wind and waves will tip it over.
3,Yard Sale material,"This cup holder will only work if you don't plan on ever having anyone sit in the back seat. The first time my daughter went to get in the back seat and raised the front seat up....there went the cup full of coffee that was in this cup holder wedged into the seat. Oh well, live and learn. Snazzy German engineering sure didn't think of useable cup holders in my cute VW New Beetle. This cup holder is in the yard sale pile now."
3,"Good Bot Mode - ""Kiddy"" Vehicle Mode","I hesitated to pick up Cliffjumper at first because I disliked the vehicle mode - it looked way to ""kiddy"" to me - almost like a Fisher Price Rescue Heroes vehicle.I finally got around to buying one and I'm fairly happy with him. His robot mode is excellent and the brown/yellow color scheme looks good.Cliffjumper is easy to transform as well, but I recommend one change in the transformation - flip the long plastic pieces on each knee up to resemble the front of his legs. The instructions state to leave this piece pointing out, but it really looks bad this way IMO."
4,"Very motivating, fun to listen to","Listening to this brings back memories... I didn't say good memories, just memories. Running sucks but this CD makes it bearable. This definitely has many of the classic cadences, I'd like to hear some of them updated, though - How long ago were Momar, Charlie, and Ivan threats? How about Saddam, Osama, and Mahmoud?The CD is heavy on the SEAL and Flight school cadences, but if you've ever been in the Navy you will recognize them and enjoy this CD."
4,Great 80's melodic rock,"Rail was another one of those better-than-average 80's bands that somehow fell through the cracks. They played the kind of melodic hard rock that was so popular at the time, and seemed to make all the right moves (recording with Heart vocalist Ann Wilson, touring with Van Halen), but never achieved the success they deserved.Fortunately the Dynasty record label reissued their early albums on CD for the first time in 2001. The Adio Special Edition reissue contains the 1984 Rail EP, the 1985 album Rail III, as well as multimedia content. All songs have been digitally remastered, and sound terrific. Adio is a great melodic rock album, though not quite as epic in nature asArrival: Special Edition.Rail is a band worth discovering. If you're a fan of 80's rock, particularly bands like Night Ranger, Aldo Nova, White Sister, and Autograph, chances are you'll find Rail to be right up your alley."
1,How Disappointing.....,"First of all, I'd like to say the concept of the book is a good idea. The format isn't even too bad, but the sunject matter is poor. Some of the dreams suggested are even pretty good. The problem is that the book is written in an almost child's book fashion and yet still contains offensive material. I was shocked to find that a book protrayed to be lighthearted contained a nightmare from a standard poodle where she was ""made to be with"" a male apricot poodle without even being able to get to know him and ""everyone was watching."" What an awful thing to put in a book of this nature. Perhaps the author was trying to make some sort of statement with this, but I think it was in poor taste."
3,Works as designed,I bought this memory to bump an old (2004) HP desktop up to 2 Gig so I could run Windows 7 on the machine just over year ago. It has been running fine since day one. Memory usually either works or it doesn't and I've always had good luck with Kingston memory. Old memory is pricey though.
5,Kingston Memory PC2700,"Bought this memory and installed it on an old micro star kt4a-v motherboard.works great.Hooked it up with an xp2400 processor,XFX Radeon hd4650 1024mb of ram AGP 8x video card,Lite-On dual layer dvd burner."
2,ok product but....,Product works fine finally!! Just be sure your system will run Value ram...my laptop finally recognized the 1GB ram after putting the prior 512MB ram back in.
5,"Right Product, Right Price","Thought I was taking a chance ordering the ""value"" version of this memory, but after a little shopping to make sure this was the correct product (as you know there are many different types of memory out there) I ordered it and it has performed perfectly."
4,Really Good,"I found this memory by Amazon, I was trying to find something cheaper but was not possible, so I decided to buy this one and after install this on my desktop, ""what a difference"", it's a really good product."
3,"Good memory for the money, however..","My 1st order was lost by USPS, but after 10 days Amazon gladly shipped another one 2-day shipping at no charge. Sometimes it's best to skip the ""Free Super Saver Shipping"" if you need an item fast.Don West Photography"
5,Glad replacing to Kingston 1GB RAM,I replaced the memory of my Pentium 4 with a Kingston ValueRAM 1GB.My PC works fast and I can surf much quicker on the internet.This product is excellent to buy.Thank youKind RegardsEbie Razak
5,Worked exactly as expected,Took only a few minutes to install and works exactly as expected. Very good value for money and item exactly as described.
2,You get what you pay for....,"I tested the RAM using System Information for Windows (SIW) and CPUID (CPU-Z) and get the speed to be 166MHz...not 333MHz. I called Kingston and their comment was that the RAM was tested to work on most industry standard devices, however, there IS a difference between ValueRAM and their standard RAM...that's why it's CHEAPER. So it's possible that it's how the RAM interfaces with my motherboard with the problem or it's the actual RAM that is the problem.In the end I'm fine with buying RAM at half the price knowing that there's a chance it won't run up to the specs that are on the label since I'm not doing anything really intensive on this computer...but if you're looking for something that will definitely run at what is advertise, you might want to consider paying a bit more.Amazon was willing to refund the item, but I'm just going to keep it."
1,Bad,"We can not give good reviews of a product that does not reach its destination, just do not recommend it."
1,Didnt do what it was suppose to do!!!!,didnt work well for me.. the computer is still too slow... I waited too long to return the item... but I was not satisfied....
1,Where's my stuff????,"I ordered my stuff on May 27, but it won't be shipped until June 11... Why? These memory chips are not one-of-a-kind or custom made, they're common computer memory chips. Most vendor's ship same day or at least within 48 hours. Very disappointed with this service!"
4,Good Memeory,"I am very happy with the product, works great. Shipping was very fast as well. I only had 512, now with this additional 1gb, wow it is like night and day, speed is much better. Price was half of what most places sell it at. Good deal."
5,Kingston memory,I upgraded my somewhat sluggish P4 from 384MB to 2GB with the Kingston DDR Ram. My P4 is set for 2100 DDR memory type which is hard to find. The Kingston ram works with either 2100 or 2700 DDR ram and makes a notable speed difference on my P4
2,Love KitchenAid but this product needs some work.,"Our kitchen is outfitted with a lot of kitchen aid utensils, mixer, ice cream machine, etc. We usually love all of their products. This was performing fine but then the bristles, which appear to be some sort of synthetic material, melted some under what I would call a very moderate heat near a BBQ grill. Not on the grill, near it. Stick to the silicon bristled products."
4,Friday's Veil Rips It Up!,"This group has a unique sound. The whole package is well-done and impressive, and the music is a fresh contribution to the pop scene. I really like the guitar rifs (both acoustic and lead). This guitarist really sounds like he knows what he's doing (and he does it in a variety of ways!). The blend is nice and the harmonies are tight. At last--a group that actually has talent!"
2,Not big enough,This mat isn't really big enough for the car seat we have. I'd rather have one that is wider and has a longer seat. We have a Britax Advocate and part of the seat always seems to be on the car seat rather than the protection mat because of the size.
4,A resonably priced option,"This is a cheaper product but it works quite. If you want something that will totally stop car seat indentions this is not it. We had them in for a couple of weeks then had to take them all out and there was indention on the cloth. It does grip well and protects from the grim, drinks and food that come with small kids (or at least our small kids). We would not replace these as we are happy with them and they work for our needs which are manly a desire to protect from the ""icky stuff"" on our cloth seats. We would also buy them again."
2,Just okay,"I got these to keep the seats in my new (to me) car from getting torn up by two car seats. However, I have since removed them. The material is pretty slippery - I felt like I was often putting them back in place, even with them tied down as instructed and the car seats installed on top."
4,Good Protection to our Leather car seats,"I tried the Lionheart brand but return it because it caused scratches to our SUV leather carseats. Then I ordered this product by chance but my husband likes it. It protects our SUV leather seats, does not slide down since there is a string to keep it stayed on. My husband told me to order 4 more for our van. I use it to protect our leather car seat where we sit directly on it but this product is not thick enough to protect the leather seat if you use it for a baby carseat."
3,Rating,"I really can not rate Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper. I have not used it yet. For what its worth, it looks like it will work."
1,"If you need this, your car seat is not safely installed!!!!!","I just want to warn all of you that a car seat should not slip if it is installed properly in the car, no matter what surface it is on. In a crash, this pad will not protect your child from the forces of collision. If you are using it only as a seat protector, great, but if you need it to stabilize the seat, either seek help from an installation expert or get a new seat that fits properly in your car. Safe travels!!!"
3,"Useful, but not the best,","This seat cover serves its purpose, but it tends to melt to the leather seats in my car when it is hot outside (I have a black vehicle). It hasn't caused permanent damage, as you can rub the melted plastic off, but it is a pain to deal with."
3,Sunshine Kids Grip it Car seat gripper.,"The product photo does not show the connection string which needs to be attached around the headrest. I am not really happy with the design, it just about serves the purpose. The seat gripper does not stay on the seat. I am not sure what it is actually gripping. Look around for other options."
4,"""Wanted Dead or Alive""","""Wanted Dead or Alive"" The True Story of Harriet Tubman is a facinating book and may prove useful in a classroom setting. Ann McGovern's writing style is a mixture of narritive and expository and makes the book both engaging and educational. ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" is comprehensive and covers Harriet Tubman's entire life and her contributions to the Underground Railroad."
3,Wanted dead or alive,"It was in the year 1820. A babygirl was born. Her name was Harriet Tubman. She was born in Maryland. She was born in a cabin. The book is about slaves that are negros. And that they all lived in Maryland because there slaves. All the slaves were mistreated. The slaves needed freedom.The message is that you you should help other people that need your help. You should never give up on what you want. Like the slaves wanting to be free.My opinion, it was cool because the slaves were given called diffrent names. When they were older they were given another name. My opinion is that it is not good to have slaves. It was a good book."
4,Melodic doom-death for fans of Paradise Lost,"Well, ignore the other review for ""Dance the Marble Naked"" as the person who posted it was referring to a different group. THIS Enchantment is a doom metal band. Paul's vocals would be the weak-link in my opinion, but overall this is a worthy addition to your doom metal collection."
2,Tough to play with,"My 4 1/2 year old son received this for Christmas and he was very excited to get started playing with it. It worked well the first few times, but it did not take long to become jammed. Now I realize that it jams very easily and quite often. The jam is easy to fix and occurs when the character slips off his platform and gets caught between the platform and the rotating wheel. This is followed by a loud clicking noise. Unfortunately it is very difficult to keep the character on the platform. Now my son lets the character drag behind on the ground to keep it moving along.The other items in this line do not have this problem as there are no rotating wheels, so I would recommend you purchase those, but probably not this one.I wanted to add that we love the Rescue Heroes line so I didn't really want to say anything negative, but felt like I should to spare others the frustration."
5,Been using this for years,"I've been using this for years and it seems to help me with environmental irritants. This is not medical advice just personal experience. It feels like my head is filling up, after a while off of it."
2,"Good pictures, bad text","There are quite many good and judiciously selected illustrations, some not seen elsewhere, but the text is a major disappointment. Adams is representative of the general anti-1960s backlash of the 1970s, writing as if the fact that the political and social achievements of the 1960s did not last for long somehow made the art of the period equally ephemeral in the long run."
3,"nice, but pretty small","Got the item quickly, and it was in a nice, shrink wrapped box, which negates any lost parts, or the possibility of. The scale is however, a little on the small side, as I was expecting something slightly bigger. Hard to judge ""scale"" sizes. NOT a bad model at all, when price is considered."
2,I would not buy this cd player,"This is the cd player that came in the car I just bought. It is pretty bad. It skips at every bump in the road, and it skips forward in the song. So you are listening to your favorite song and then you hit a tiny bump and all the sudden it is two more minutes into the song. The worst is when it skips to the next song. The sound is good when it isn't skipping, or when it is on the radio, (which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1)"
5,great price,I almost bought this battery from the security alarm folks and would have paid a whole lot more for the same battery...it pays to shop Amazon!!!
5,Does Exactly What it Says,"This is a great gadget to have around to keep a spare Blackberry battery fully charged. If you run out of juice and have no place to charge your Blackberry, you can pop in a fully charged battery."
2,A bit flawed?,"Okay, now I'm a fan of Susan Strasberg, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern and Dean Stockwell. I also grew up in the 60s. This movie is a kick because it's a throwback to every indulgence we let ourselves have. As a work of art, this is mediocre at best. As a slice of Americana that has nothing to do with Grant Wood, this is the height of kitsch. You'll either love or hate it. If you're not sure which camp you're in, then I'm betting that you'll hate it. It is good for a laugh or two - especially the hair and clothes. Oh my lord, did I really dress like that? Unfortunately, I did."
3,Not enough content,"My son is at a 4th grade math level and he loved this game, but beat it completely in less than 4 hours! It would be a great game if they added more content and made it a little more challenging. This is well below a 5th grade level and anyone in the 5th grade would not be challenged at all. My 4th grader wasn't and he is not that strong in math."
1,"Do a search on FTC and Lentek, or Lentek and Bankruptcy","In 2002 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged Lentek with making false and unsubstantiated claims in advertisements for its electronic mosquito and pest repellers and its air cleaning products. Six months later Lentek signed an agreement with the FTC to stop making such claims. In 2003 Lentek went through bankruptcy and was taken over by Koolatron.The Centers for Disease Control(CDC) tested electromagnetic and ultrasound devices and found they do not work.Neither Lentek or Koolatron has produced studies showing the products work.Before buying, do a search on various combinations of Lentek, FTC, bankruptcy, Kootatron."
4,"Makes running ""fun!""","This Navy SEALs run to cadence cd was the first of 4 I have purchased so far, and after listening to it, I found myself perfectly distracted while running. I never really got that into running because it's just so boring to me. However, after listening to these ""Run to Cadence with:"" cd's, I can honestly say that now I actually look forward to running!! It totally takes your mind off the act of running and is fun to sing along with. The ONLY reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I also ordered the USMC running to cadence cd's vol.1,2,&3, and WOW, those are WAAY better. The guys voices in those all have gusto, where as this cd is pretty flat comparitively. But, if I didn't know any different, then I would have rated this cd 5 stars. Worth checking out and will help you run further! Great purchase!!"
5,Finally a mathematical origami book that I can follow!,"I have a personal and professional interest in mathematical origami. However, until reading this book, I had trouble finding math origami directions that are easy to follow. If you want to build geometric models, this book will not disappoint you. The directions are clear, and the illustrations help, too. But first go to AIMS website to compare the price of this book straight from the publisher."
2,A WASTE OF MONEY,NO WONDER THIS GUY DID NOT MAKE IT.hIS CD WAS NOT THAT GOOD.A COUPLE OF BEATS WHERE OK.BUT THE RAPPING IS REALLY BAD.NEEDS MORE WORK TO EVEN GET THREE STARS.
5,Big OOMP Running things Pt. 3,This album deserves a 6 star. Every single song is tight. Especially #2 3 5 7 8 9 11 12 14 and 16. If you want a off da chain album this is it.
2,cheap make,"The make/quality of this dustpan is as low as its price. Just be advised that the plastic is the thin, brittle type, thus it cracks and breaks very easily. For the price, I cannot make a formal complaint."
3,Cute but hard to build,"This plane was a perfect fit for my sons birthday. My only 2 complaints was that putting it together was not as easy as they stated, the instructions where not very good. Also it isn't very durable, I found that the back wing pieces would just fall out. Not something I would allow the kids to play with."
2,Strange choice of places to ride!,"Since this is a second edition, I thought some things would be corrected, but David Crowell must not accually ride the trails in his book. Some of the worst inaccuracies are in the Wet Mountain Valley section. Ghost town loop is paved and goes along a housing area, not ghost towns. Rainbow Trail is NOT prime trail, it's extremely rocky, gravely and not at all enjoyable to ride! Many fellow riders have likened it to riding down a creek bed - not fun. Rides like Hermit Pass and South Colony are better suited for a 4-wheel drive jeep. I wouldn't suggest riding quite a few of the trails in his book but if you do, just beware!"
2,Outdated,"This book maybe useful, but it is way outdated. Some of the trails are in poor condition and really not rideable able I wonder if the author may have not rode some of these trails?"
2,Angry New York punks sign record deal,"I read a review acclaiming this album as the greatest thing to happen to American metal in 1996, etc., etc., needless to say I picked it up. Yawn. Another bunch of Biohazard/Black Flag wannabes with their predictable riffage and bleeding heart lyrics. The production is fine and some of the music shows promise, but the unfounded arrogance prevalent (especially in the laughable liner notes) set a bad backdrop from the get-go. Whether or not this band still exists is not clear, perhaps the fact I have never heard anything about them since Master Killer should tell me something. Don't waste your money on this--- 2, 3, maybe 4 listens and you'll file it away forever."
5,Rose Charm,"For Christmas I wanted to give my sister a Rose Charm in memory of our Father who passed away two years earlier. I searched the jewerly stores at the local malls with now luck, either too cheap looking or no real depth. So decided to do a quick search on Google and found this charm on Amazon. I took a chance and ordered it.The charm arrived before xmas which was great since I ordered it on the 18th of December and it was beautiful, it had real weight and great detail particularly around the bud. I also liked that it had a lobster claw clasps, she could put it on right away.Very satisfied with the service and the qualityMy sister loved it"
1,Extremely disappointing.,"Goes into detail on the torture death of children while their mother watches, when no detail was needed. Gruesome, disgusting, not at all like other books by Bradley. Get this only if you enjoy creep-out violence for its own sake."
4,More Madness from the Head Nutty Boy,"This seven-track CD single was the fourth release from Suggs's first solo CD ""The Lone Ranger"" and is a cover of the old Simon & Garfunkel chestnut. It's a great ripping version, especially with the production courtesy of reggae legends Sly and Robbie, nothing at all that far removed from the classic Madness sound. The seven tracks are all different mixes or versions of the song; admittedly something more for obsessive fans or someone who really loves the song and wants the mixes. The mixes are as follows:7"" MixRapino's 7"" MixRapinos 12"" Disco InstrumentalRapinos 12"" Disco MixDeep Pan MixDrumapella MixAlternative Mix"
2,Not for hardcore fans,"Johan is hot and you do see him naked, but if you're looking for hardcore action, this is NOT the video for you."
2,Get this movie...,ONLY if all you are interested in seeing goodlooking young males. It is not much else...
3,Broken Binding,The product came on time but there was damage to the binding. There were highlighting but that was expected. Overall the book looks good for the price I paid for it.
5,The very best,This is undoubtedly the very best tomato soup you will ever taste. There is no equal to this product. It is amazing that I am the first to write a review of this product. I captures all of the finest elements of tomato soup with just the right combination of spices and texture. Wow! Buy this and you will not be disappointed. I could eat this every day.
4,Soooooo good,"Word to the wise: Amy's makes the soups that Trader Joe's carries, so save yourself $6 by buying 12 cans at your local Trader Joe's, if you have one. This soup might have relatively high sugar content, but damn is it good. Perhaps the best canned soup I've ever had."
