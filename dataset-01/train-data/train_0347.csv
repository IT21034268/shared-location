3,I expected more of an emphasis on sociology and less on marketing,This book serves as a justification for the marketing techneques used in the wine trade. I was disappointed because I expected something more academic. It was well written and I appreciated the historical parts in particular. I would recommend it as a primer for those in wine marketing and for those studying for the MW exams
1,Smells spoiled,"I love body butter and bought this in Ucluelet, an outpost on Vancouver Island. To tell the truth, it smells spoiled. Like something had gone bad in it. Lime, papaya, whatever else is in it, my nose cannot decipher.Pathetically enough, I am using it since my skin won't know the difference. I hate spending fifteen bucks and then throwing away the product."
5,"wolfstone ""unleashed""","OUTSTANDING! I found out about Wolfstone though Amazon's recommendations. Instead of buying the lastest cd, I thought I would start with their first. I'm glad I did. I am looking forward to adding more wolfstone cd's to my Library."
2,..... not worth getting,Not very strong all u can do with them is throw them into the air and they make alittle noise very weak magnets
3,Good Indo-Pop,"I am not into Bollywood music or Indo-pop-- I go more for Indian classical or Asian undergound. But, if you are, this album is a lot of fun and certainly one of the best in its category."
5,Great Moment,"We are glad to listen Alish Chinay Music. So, I want to Down Load this review and sample."
3,A nice introduction to modern Indian music,"From an Indian friend I heard Alisha is one of the most popular singers there. I don't find the songs very interesting, although Made in India sounds alright. Dhadkan sounds an awful lot like Give it up by the Good men. If you like this, try the double CD by Asha Bhosle: Personal memories: Rahul & I, which contains remixed Bollywood classics and is much better!"
5,The Queen Of India Pop,"I am an American who is a big fan of Indian Pop- Hindi Pop. Alisha is probably it's biggest star. This CD is great, especially the tittle track. If you ever get to see the video of Made In India it is great also. Among my favorites in India-Hindi Pop along with Suneeta Rao, Colonial Cousins, Daler Mahendi, Models, and Anu Malik. Made In India is clearly five stars."
5,Essential if going to Florence,"McCarthy writes with wit about the history, current conditions(1964, when the book was published) and tourist attractions in Florence. Her advice is invaluable for finding little-known churches, and her descriptions of life in the city, and advice on when to go and where to stay, are vivid and helpful for any traveler in Italy."
2,Dry and dated,"The book tries to tell you all- art history, general history, and some travel writing as well. As a result it has too little of everything, and I found its style dry and boring. The book was written some 50 years ago and is very much dated- so much has been discovered regarding art history during that long time. It's beyond me why it's still in print."
3,Ehhhh,"The first chapter is a whine-a-thon - and I never thought she would finish complaining about Florence - the traffic, the people,the sidewalks, the noise. It would discourage anyone from wanting to visit the city! While the bitter complaining ceased by chapter two, it was merely replaced by an convoluted nonlinear vesrion of history - there was more jumping around in there than a trampolene toped with 10 five-year-olds. She managed to more or less cover about 250 years of Florentine history in a dizzying circle of names and events. While the stories were interesting - if you didn't know an Italian history, you would certainly be lost, as she forgot to mention dates. I was thrilled when it was over. However, it did manage to easily put me to sleep several nights."
4,"After an irritating start, a real pleasure","In the first chapter of THE STONES OF FLORENCE Mary McCarthy weighs in against everyone who might want to know about Florence who deeply irritates her: casual tourists, Europeans who love Florence deeply... who, you might wonder, is the book intended for? But once she gets this out of her system (though not ever entirely--as the book continues she often takes little sideswipes at everyone, even including Goethe!), the book settles down to be a very idiosyncratic and informative study of a city Mccarthy loves and knows well. Skip the intro (or at least try not to let it get under your collar) and keep plugging along: this is a highly readable and fun little book."
4,Stones of Florence,"I just finished this book prior to a trip to Florence. This is a book of commentary and Mary McCarthy's observations and knowledge about Florence. I found it very useful, and in parts very fascinating. I'd recommend it before taking a trip to Florence.The beginning is a bit slow. But when it picks up, afer the first chapter or so, it goes much faster. I would have gotten more out of it, and it would have gone faster, if I had already read one of my other books about Florence, say ""Florence: Biography of a City"" or ""Florence A Portrait."" This is because, especially at the beginning, she comments on artists and places I'm not familiar with.Her commentary about art and artists is really must read information. Especially about Uccello and, later, the Mannerists. There's some great history here, too. I'd STRONGLY recommend reading this book before a trip to Florence."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","Although I do like the emphasis on organizing synonyms by nuances of meaning, the thesaurus doesn't measure up to my favorite, The Synonym Finder, by J.I. Rodale (1978). The Rodale version provides many more synonyms per term and many more terms overall. My edition was getting pretty beat up, and later versions of the Rodale were not getting equal reviews, so I had hoped the American Heritage thesaurus would fill the gap. I'll use it, but I'll probably supplement it with my old Rodale, too."
5,Excellent product,Use it with the children to help complete homework assignments. Typeset and font are easy to read. Binding is excellent.
2,Where are the synonyms?,"What I look for in a good thesaurus is quick-to-find, accurate, fairly substantial lists of synonyms. Except in a few cases, this disappointing book doesn't offer such lists. I'm not sure how anyone could get much use out of it."
5,A great read!,"Imagine a family of five dealing with bugs,flies,no t.v., no mail, just a mud hut. with a mongoose. What a great lady. What a super book."
4,Unlikely But True,"What a great story!!! What a witty writer !!! Could have only happened in the fifties,sixties, and seventies from an American perspective. Must read to understand the old world order in a shrinking world."
5,An excellent account .....,"This is a trully great account of the ""Ressurection"". Philarmonia at top form and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's voice being out of this world (The account of Norman with Maazel and the VPO is also exceptional but unfortunately out of print...). I have seen many reviews critisizing the final movement. Well... for me is simply amazing. You can feel the power and ""see"" the angels coming.... For me this is the best account of the symphony. It has also the great advantage of coming in one mid-price CD. The sound of course can not match the best modern digital accounts but is descend. As an alternative (if you need both great performances and great sound), I suggest Rattle's account for EMI, Slatkin's for Telarc, Kaplan's for Conifer and last (but not least) Bernstein's for DG."
2,Mediocre,"I have four recordings of this symphony: this one, Bernstein (NY Phil); Solti (LSO); and Slatkin (St. Louis). This performance conducted by Klemperer is by far the worst. Tempi and dynamics regularly ignore Mahler's instructions, ensemble is sloppy, ugly instrumental tone quality abounds, and intonation is horrendous, especially in the all-important final measures, with everyone apparently playing as loudly as they can without regard to balance or tone quality. The Slatkin recording with the St. Louis Symphony (who would have guessed!) is the best: superb in all of these categories. I also highly recommend the Bernstein, not for its accuracy, but for the special excitement he brings to the score. However, be aware that it is more Bernstein than Mahler."
5,A clear first choice,"Mahler's second symphony has its greatest exponent in Otto Klemperer. He performed it frequently, and this celebrated incarnation of Klemperer's interpretation is an unsurpassed achievement. Klemperer's grasp of the details is impressive, as well as his overall view of the work as an organic whole. The Philharmonia plays beautifully - the orchestra was in its best shape when this recording was made early in the sixties. Choir and soloists are also impressive.Moreover, the recording quality is good enough for most ears, at least if your hifi equipment is of decent quality.This is the recording of the second symphony that I appreciate most, a frontrunner before Scherchen's with the Vienna Symphony and Walter's with New York Philharmonic. It has its place in every collector's shelf. A real desert island disc, warmly recommended."
3,"Beautiful watch, crappy packaging","I purchased this watch to give as a gift. It is beautiful! But the box it is packaged in looks like it fell off the back of a truck. It must have been something that prior to shipment because the shipping box is fine and it was well packed.I realize it's a good price, but I'm very disappointed in the service from Amazon on this one!"
2,Good idea... But terrible product quality,"I am sorry to report that the bad reviews were accurate: The paint does not stick well to the plastic and peels off after drying, also some of the paint colors were dry and unusable.Since the paint was not working too well, we tried markers but they did not work either.In short, the idea of painting bugs is so cool that I bought the product even after reading some of the bad reviews. These guys need to improve the product quality, and find compatible paints or make the bugs with a different material."
4,Great Fun,"My twins played with this toy in speech therapy. So, I ordered it online at Amazon. They have lots of fun with it."
5,My Review!!,"Of all the Buster Keaton videos I've seen so far I think this was the best!!It was just too funny. There was hardy a moment I wasen't laughing. One of my favorite parts was where Buster and the girl he's with are trying to find a safe place to sleep.It's the kind of movie you have to see for you self: words can't discribe it exeped for, great and funny. and even those aren't enough. It was that good."
3,"Moving sentiment, lukewarm music","John Cale & Lou Reed being amongst my favourite artists of all time, it grieves me to report that I do not consider Drella to be amongst their best. I think it's to do with the instrumentation, but even after many years of trying hard, I still do not enjoy this album except for A Dream and Hello, It's Me.The first, spoken by John Cale, sounds like an excerpt from Warhol's diaries (although I'm not sure it really is) whilst the second is a very poignant and tender epilogue with a beautiful melody. The biographical lyrics of all the songs are quite moving, but somehow, something's missing. I am very pleased, though, that many other fans regard it highly."
3,LUKEWARM,"Cale & Reed being amongst my favourite artists of all time, it grieves me to report that I do not consider Drella to be amongst their best. I think it's to do with the instrumentation, but even after many years of trying hard, I still do not enjoy this album except for A Dream and Hello, It's Me. The first, spoken by John Cale, sounds like an excerpt from Warhol's diaries (although I'm not sure it really is) whilst the second is a very poignant and tender epilogue with a beautiful melody. The biographical lyrics of all the songs are very good, but somehow, something's missing. I am very pleased, though, that many other fans regard it highly by giving it five stars!"
2,So so,"There a few nice pieces on here, ""Open House,"" Nobody But You,"" ""Hello It's Me,"" But so much else on it sounds like some marginally talented teenagers jamming in one of their bedrooms. I know Reed and Cale are talented, but they decided to only have the two of them play on this record because they were both Warhol disciples, and didn't want any ""outsiders"" involved. But they needed more musicians, or should have overdubbed more instruments themselves. A whole album of fairly heavy stuff, but not one drum sound on the whole album, is a bit weak. Having NO DRUMS was a bad idea! It's a shame, because I'm a big Lou Reed fan, and a big Andy Warhol fan, and this should have been great, but it's just not."
4,This one will grow on you,"I didn't like this album when I first heard it. I found it pretentious and self-conciously arty. However, when I listened a few more times and learned to accept it on its own terms (so to speak), I found it quite moving. If it's a bit talky, it is certainly heartfelt; ""Slip Away"" is especially affecting. If you don't like this one, give it a chance. Listen to it a few times, late at night if possible. You might find it grows on you, too."
2,Not so good,"My opinion about Daniel O'Donnell is a mixed one. I love many of his songs, yet many other songs also sung by him bore me to death. He may sound sweet and gentle and soothing, but he may also sound bland and untalented, which is really strange. Now on DVDs he looks fine when he was filmed outdoors, but on stage he is absolutely horrible. The way he moves and his gestures are so effeminate and irritating I couldn't bear looking. Why couldn't the guy just walk instead of jumping in small steps like a little girl? What on earth did he dip his knees in the middle of a song for? No wonder there were few men in the audience, and none of them smiled. They must have been bullied by their wives into coming to the show. Now I know Daniel is better heard than seen. I will continue listen to his music, but seeing him on stage is a big no for me. Sorry, Daniel."
5,Wonderful,I love this DVD. Perhaps because I love Daniel. He is so warm and natural. I love his way of mastering the whole stage as he performs. His combination of Irish and country is just right. Songs with Mary Duff are lovely and fun. His entire group of musicians completes the picture. The segment with his Mother was sweet and said so much about him. I enjoyed the BC story. The scenes of Ireland were breathtaking. This is a keeper.
4,I like it alot,"I bought this game mainly because I ride a dualsport motorcycle featured in the game and because I am a big fan of the race.I really enjoyed this game,it has cool grafics and great control,but the music sucks,if you can over look that,its pretty nice."
2,Save your money,"I bought this game because it was an off- road racing game, and ...its a waste of money. I would recommend test drive off road instead of this game, I have both. After playing this game once I probably won't ever play it again. The graphics and game playing are very poor, definately not playstation 2 standards. I gave it 2 stars only because I've played worse games."
1,bad for children,"This game is so horrible for kids.recently my son fell in a pit of fire and said ""women where's the reset button"". I had to actually slap him silly for playing the game."
1,DON'T BUY IT....,"Purchased the game, what a waist. Rushed home to play, looked pretty cool. Noticed it was a DVD not CD like some other ps2 games, which means more space, better graphics, and possibly a better game. ONE WORD FOR YOU NOOOOOPE! I wish I would have gone to the winghouse for happy hour instead. ;} At least then I would have had a pleasurable expierence when waisting $.."
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY,I have a friend named Beebo he is sad me and him bought this game it is terrible whatever you do don't buy it AVOID AT ALL COSTS get MeTaL GeAr SoLiD 2 sOnS oF LiBeRtY.
2,I've seen better on a PS1,"The game has so much promise and delivers nothing. The loading time between races is forever and the graphics do nothing to challenge the system. When it finally loaded and the racing began, all I could think of was Out Run. The handling is poor and difficult to manage. I dare not even try Campaign mode, this is just a poorly designed game. The upside and why I rated it so high is the FMV scenes are nice to watch. Overall save your money."
1,Very Insensitive,"I will go right to the point. The person who approved putting up a link to a Chris Benoit DVD along with the news of the death's of Chris Benoit & his family should be reprimanded at the least.I am sure that this was put up in the hours after the news came out. However, knowing what we know now the entire blurb about the deaths & the dvd link should be removed.Just my opinionBob"
5,If WWE read it please look the128 reviewer in WM XX,"Today, I am reading the WWE WM XX, if you read my write read inWM XX in 128 reviewer, he is want to order Undertaker Gravest Matches, and read it,he is want to WWE release Old School Matches like Undertaker gravest Matches, he want many matches like Undertaker feud with Giant Gonzales, King Kong Bundy, Jimy Snuka. His choose is very good to watch. He is very smart. But if WWE release that I want to WWE will release all Undertaker matches in WM, Bam Bam Bigelow with the other he want. it is very good to watch.About Chris benoit it is very good DVD, there are matches:like vs The Game and Shawn, His neck Broken, He vs Eddie Guererro, vs Sabu and many more.It is 5 stars, but i want WWE release Undertaker is very good like taht, if WWE want."
1,Burn in hell,No matter how talented he was the fact is that he murdered his wife and seven year old son. This man is human scum and hopefully is burning in hell. R.I.P. to his wife and son I hope your in a better place. One star because this dvd is gonna go up in price once the gory details are more widley know. Also thanks to the WWE for pulling him off their website I bet they wish they would have waited on that tribute to what a great family guy he was. As for the dvd review sorry fanboys it doesn't matter cause in the real world he was/is a scumbag and a baby killer.
1,Please take this down,You are promoting a dvd for a double murderer...it is embarrassingthat you would actually keep this dvd on here...please take it down. That man deserves nothing but hell. Amazon is only hurting themselves by keeping this up.
1,R.I.P. Benoit. U WILL NOT BE MISSED.,now me bein a wrestlin fan n me first hearing of this i was so sad to hear benoit. n i thought he shouldve been in the hall of fame. but learnin about todays events. he doesnt even deserve to be mentioned again. i would personally burn this dvd to know about this. also the wwe pulled evry single thing involving benoit n thank god. i hope u dont rest in peace benoit. may the devil own ur soul n torture it forevr. u will not be missed.
4,wonderful,"It was wonderful. It wasn't as good as some other wrestling movies, but it did have some cool matches."
5,Bunch of idiots...,"How can you guys actually write all these reviews for this dvd when IT'S NOT EVEN OUT YET... sure, anyone can write the match listings... but what's the point of having some REVIEW the product when it's not even out... just bunch of high school idiots who have nothing better to do... Try to get a diploma."
3,"The Brighter the Picture, the Darker the Negative","While it is completely understandable that WWE would sever all ties with Chris Benoit, the guy murdered his wife and child, it is *not* Amazon's responsibility to pull the product, it is the WWE's.Chris Benoit was an amazing in ring talent, and as many people who knew Benoit on the tribute stated, they believed him to be a great guy. This was a shock to the WWE as much as anyone else.While we can't erase Chris Benoit from history, it would be foolish to try and do so, the WWE can do the right thing and no longer produce the DVD and take it out of circulation, or update the DVD with a more accurate look at him."
4,Time to Separate Entertainment from Life,"Do I still watch and love the Naked Gun movies even though OJ Simpson was in them? Yes. How about listening to music Phil Specter produced? Yep. For all you obnoxious knee-jerk reactionaries (most of whom I see have posted only ONE review, this one)... there's real life, and there's fiction. You want an easy answer, to just go ahead and blot out history? IF what this person did is entirely true, it is terrible. But it's time to separate an entertainment DVD from real life. The WWE is pulling all trace of Benoit from its company. As for Amazon, it is not, and should not be their job to censor. Nothing will change the fact that there are great matches on this one, part of wrestling history. If you try to rewrite or erase history, too, you can never learn from it."
5,toothless agression,"Chris benoit is one of the best wrestlers of all time in my book, this dvd was made before he died so he does alot of talkin in it. This is a great dvd with some great matches"
2,Dissapointing,When I ordered this dvd on April 4th and paid extra postage it was indicated that I would receive it in a couple of days. It was after Easter when it arrived and the occasion where we had children gathered was passed. I wrote and tried to return it and received no response from Mirmar or Amazon. I am not happy about this purchase or seller
3,Kinda Goofy - And chaotic,Cram every holiday into one movie and see if the kids can make sense of it. This is not one of the better of these kind of movies. Certainly not as bad as Rudolph's Shiny New Year which randomy introduces all kinds of weird characters. Get all of the other holiday movies before this one.
5,Great for the kids,This was a movie I grew up with and was very happy to findit on DVD. Great kids movie.
5,Easter Bunny,It's an awesome addition the my extensive DVD collection and I couldn't be happier with the quality of the DVD
2,Not Up to Par,This special lacked the magic and charm of the others. Maybe because I didn't remember it or maybe I didn't remember it cause it wasn't very good. I love Rankin & Bass but the songs and story were kind of meh. I did think the color palette held up well.
5,Timeless Easter movie that is still enjoyable at almost 30!,"I love this movie. I am not ever really sure you outgrow the love that you have for the older movies they play on TV during the holidays though. When I had my daughter I showed her the Christmas and Thanksgiving classics, but when Easter came around I really wanted to show her this movie because I LOVED it! My daughter was completely captivated! She loved it too! I was so happy! I wasn't going to buy it BUT the price was SO right on Amazon, I couldn't resist. Great price, Classic movie, Super Purchase. :)"
4,Rankin-Bass hits a double,"I remember watching Here Comes Peter Cottontail as a child, but hadn't seen it on television for ages. Netflix doesn't offer it, so I thought it would be worth the ten bucks to see it again. The villain, playing by Vincent Price, is over the top, like most of the Rankin-Bass villains, and the story is a bit strange, but the animation is fun and the easter colors are cheery. Kids who enjoy ""The Easter Bunny Is Coming to Town"" will enjoy this. Nostalgia buffs will be grateful to see it again. I don't know that Rudolph is really a better creation, just more iconic."
4,Music class special,"OK, That may be taken any way, personally I thought that it was a great CD, if you like Pop from the 80's with a Christian message this is the CD to get (remember that is my personal opinion.)! I sang some of these songs during my music lessons at school and grew to really like her style. I borrowed the CD from a friend and took a long time too before finally desiding that it was time to give it back and get my own copy!"
4,Leslie/Sam Phillips,I have been a fan of Contempary Christian Music for several years and Leslie/Sam Phillips was included with that area.This album I think tells many listeners who never heard of any of her past recordings shows what she has done. I have heard some of her newer recordings under Sam Phillips and they have lost the feeling of God's love in them. I kinda feel like the other review: I miss them and want more. I pray that Leslie/Sam would return to the Christian Music market again so that many who would like her past style of music would start collecting again and many who have not heard of her could start a new collection of the music that speaks of God's love!I know that I'm not alone in prayer for this to happen!Thanks Leslie/Sam
2,Error-Ridden,"Full of errors -- within the first few entries it states that 22 people died of Anthrax in the 2001 outbreak (22 people contracted Anthrax, 5 died) and that only 12 documented cases of blastomycosis have occurred in the U.S. (don't know the exact number, but it's in the hundreds, at least.) Also, the photos are unlabeled and I'm pretty sure sometimes attached to the wrong disease. Disappointing."
2,"Interesting Idea, but Falls very short given the diseases it lists....","How can this book even be taken seriously when it leaves out such diseases as Huntington's and Lou Gerics, but has something as mild as children's ""Fifth Disease"" listed, which is simply a mild rash? Also I have to agree with last poster, there was NOT 22 deaths due to anthrax in the USA on one given occasion-which I also read. This book was thrown together quickly with little research."
5,Great book of the great man,"I highly recommend anybody interested in poetry to purchase this edition. Complete yet cheap it gives you a whole image of Yeats poet, starting from ""The Rose"" and ""The Wild Swans of Coole"" to his Last Poems of 38-39. The developement or rather evolution of his genious covers such a wide range that it would have been enough for some 10 fine poets. If you know his early poems, you don't know Yeats. If you know his late poems you do not know him either. He is a Proteus, and you need to get aquointed with as many disguises of him as you can.I must mention, that the explanatory notes are not sufficient to my taste."
1,Poor formatting on Kindle,"+ 5 stars for content- Formatting on Kindle is not goodWhen viewing last page of poem, the title of next poem is seen on bottom of Kindle page in large bold print.I find this distracting"
4,Yeats' collected poems,"The book arrived in very good condition, and I'm quite pleased with it; there was one page in the beginning torn out, but it wasn't important, and didn't have a poem on it.I was just curious to know what it was"
2,Yeats,"the book was very used, quite old, and had writing all through it {notes from classes?} the poems are still good though"
5,The Bible of car enthusiast,"This book is the bible for the car enthusiast. Thousand makers from around all the world are coverede here, with thousand pictures. Great Deal!"
3,We enjoyed hearing the music.,We enjoyed hearing the music. However the program was not the same as was listedon the program CD.
5,From a time since passed,"This French and Canadian co-production is set in the 1970s and tells the tale of white women from Canada and America who ventured to a resort hotel in Haiti to soak up the sun and the attention of young male islanders. This subject is tastefully handled and the vacationing ladies, the gigolos, and other key characters are all portrayed as complex individuals rather than stereotypes. The dialogue is in both French and English, but this subtle masterpiece could have been shot without sound and still work as cinema, so riveting are the dramatic scenes and the Haitian scenery, the latter both beautiful and squalid."
3,Heading for a Snooze,It was not an awful movie but it was strange seeing such a great actress like Ms. Rampling in this type of movie.
3,How to Rock Climb!,"I'm a beginner at rock climbing and reading this book for instructional purposes. While it does a good job of explaining fundamentals I have found certain sections difficult to follow - often times different moves will be referecned before the section that explains them (sometimes with a referencing page, sometimes without). I also found it poorly edited in some spots - mis-refenced pages, paragraphs seemingly in wrong order (ie. pg 62 claims there is a ""taping"" illustration on pg 60, it is clearly on pg 63; the last and second to last paragraphs on page 63 seem to be flip flopped)."
2,Not for the best to start off with,"The book is strange. It's written for beginners but they use a lot of jargon that beginners don't know. Also, while they do their best, there is a lot of things that they talk about but don't show pictures for. It's really difficult to learn about any technique when there are not pictures for half of the topics they discuss."
5,definative basics book,This book is probably the best book you could buy if you're just starting out. I bout it and it helped me to understand a lot of the fundamental ideas in climbing
4,Slightly mixed bag,"I guess I was hoping for something a bit more in the Jazzmatazz vein, so this was a slight disappointment. Stylistically it comes close to George Benson at times, which is no bad thing, and there are a few very groovy tracks (Brighter Day is a standout), but at times and especially from the half-way point, it begins to slide into blandness, and he just seems to be practising his arpeggios. Nevertheless a very pleasant listen for those quiet evenings."
5,Deliciously Different,"There's a lot of reviews bashing this for Jordan migrating away from the hip-hoppish sound of his other albums - so why do I think this is such a great album? Ronny is probably the best modern jazz guitarist of recent times, and this showcases it better than many of his other works - if the first two tracks don't convince you of that, so be it; go pick up his definitive albumLight to Darkinstead. Either way, Jordan rules!!"
3,"Nice guitar, Ok singers","Actually, I like Ronny's music because of his guitar work. Seems that on all of his Cds the vocal content is hit or miss. Some hit, some really miss. This CD was no different. But his guitar continues to get sound better and better."
2,Ronny's First CD for Blue Note,"and for me it was a disapointment. The think thats sets Ronny apart from the rest of the field is his street-flavoured, hip hop fusion jazz thing. This album lacks that this ingredient, and if this doesn't bother you, than I think you will love this CD. Only cut I really like is 5/8."
2,"Whatever this is, it sure isn't jazz","Let's get something straight from the jump, I own 2 other Ronny Jordan albums. I think he gets excellent tone from his Gibson semi-hollow body. But this album is fully a half step in the wrong direction. If he thinks signing with Blue Notes means he needs to play more jazz, then he needs to develop more chops. The next-to-last cut with vibes demi-god Stefon Harris and drummer Tain Watts proves that; Jordan has absolutely nothing to say in that idiom. And trying to play ""Mambo Inn""?!? Who is he kidding. No serious jazz fan can listen to that without thinking of Grant Green and his Latin Bit album of 35 years ago. Ronny Jordan is like Mike Myers; he has his niche (up-tempo instrumental R&B), but he absolutely shouldn't try Shakespeare (not sell it anyway)......"
1,Thanks for saving me concert money,"I agree with Bob at the end of these reviews. I listened to this cd and what's Ronny Jordan up to? Hip-hop? Jazz? Easy listening? It's too mixed up. I like all the above but not mixed together. There's a couple of good numbers here, specifically ""Mystic Voyage"". The point is that he's coming to Anchorage at the end of September and I just saved $60 bucks on tickets."
1,SCARY,"I bought this stove a few months ago and finally got around to using it last month in my backyard before a hiking trip. I experienced a catastrophic fuel leak coming from where the fuel line connected to the stove at the valve. I pumped it up, walked away for a few minutes to take answer a call, this was at night by the way, and I lit up the stove to prime, flash! A bigass a flame came off the ground from where there was a giant fuel puddle. Of course, I didn't notice this and I knelt down inside it. I'm OK, but it gave me a huge fright, I was next to the garden hose so I sprayed myself off when my pants caught on fire.Be wary of fuel leaks for whoever is using this or any other liquid fuel stoves. I haven't touched it since. The whole experience pissed me off to high hell and left a bad taste in my mouth."
5,Brilliant concept for a backpacking stove,This stove will use anything that is conbustable you cant beat it when your in pinch. It will with no problem cook in a very strong wind. I cooked in a mass blizzard here in Montana with no problem. I recomend this product anytime.
4,Good to have!,"I thought my days of fun in the sun were over due to my inability to walk long distances. I was happy to find beaches with wheel chairs, available for the asking, that roll on the sand."
5,Fantastic Cover,"It came out almost 20 yrs ago - an acoustic cover of ""Like a Prayer"". It's actually an excellent song which is more easily realized when it's just a decent musician and his guitar, rather than Madonna and the over-production that accompanied her original."
5,Love it!,"This blanket is perfect. I live near the ocean and it never gets terribly cold (I put my down comforter in storage when I moved here), but evenings are chilly year 'round. This blanket is just enough to keep warm and has the soft, comfortable feeling of down."
5,Thizztastic,"I have to admit that I was hesitant to cop this cd when I first heard about it. But I heard a couple of people tell me how good it was and I had to see for my self. In my opinion Mall kinda fell off after Untouchable, so I wasn't really feelin it. However, I was very surprised when I listened to this CD that man came sick (Especially on maca-frama-lamma #11) . As for Andre Macassi there was no doubt he was gonna come with it and he did fa sho. This whole CD is slap from 1-12. The hottest track has got to be Dredio(#12) with a surprising visit from from the other V-town legend e-40. Ever since I bought this CD I haven't listened to anything else. If you don't have this one you're dead wrong. Go cop it!!Thizz In Peace MAC DRE"
2,not what i expected,i am a huge dre fan but this didn't do it. tracks 3 and 12 are pretty good but other than that i didn't enjoy it. peep some of his other albums though.
4,I used this product when one of my ...,"I used this product when one of my sons got a cut on his elbow. It worked well through several baths and was great at sealing out the water (as well as dirt!) Will definitely use these for my kids, but I would have liked to have seen more sizes available."
2,The bandages worked fairly well but I didn't ...,"The bandages worked fairly well but I didn't really find them terrific in the water-block area. I've used other brands of waterproof bandages that I believe resisted water better. They lasted through several hand washings, but later on in the day I had trouble with them staying on. They were good at not sticking together while putting one on. They were also good at going on parts of the body other than the hands."
3,The bandage feels like a quality product with ...,"The bandage feels like a quality product with the tape portion looking very strong, yet flexible on the skin... Steps ahead of the old plastic-like bandages. This product will work well for very small wounds, as the actual gauze portion is only a short strip within the bandage. Unfortunately, I didn't find it to be very effective at waterblocking, as it started falling off my hand after the first light handwashing."
4,This product was nice. Stayed on with water. ...,This product was nice. Stayed on with water. I would definitely buy it again.
3,More suited towards the C major.,"A great recording of the Haydn C, displaying Slava's wonderful boisterous qualities with the cello. However, with the D major concerto having so many smooth melodic lines, it does not in my opinion go well with this heavy style of playing. The Yo-Yo Ma recording of the Haydn D is very beautiful. Buy this for the C, and Yo Yo for the D."
2,try Feuermann's,"Rostropovich may be playing himself, but I don't think it is nearly as good as Haydn intended. Try Feuermann's and give yourself a real treat!"
3,Retro rock-Los Lobos style,"Los Lobos is one of the greatest bands to come out of LA. They are nearly on a par with the Doors or Frank Zappa. Like any great band, they are always innovating and exploring.In this album, they explore retro-rock, borrowing from the sounds of the early sixties, before the British invasion. They mix rockabilly, country, R&B, Tejano and straight ahead rock. There are some excellents songs on this CD, like Emily. But there are a number of songs that are just merely good. These tend to be the overly blended songs that come out bland.I like everything by Los Lobos, but I think they are at their best when they really go off into new areas. I think that Colossal Head was their best album and one of the best albums of the nineties."
3,There's Something Missing,These guys are good musicians. They know their craft. That's why it seems like something is missing. Their skill is evident on this album but there is no excitement. That is a fatal flaw in a recording.
5,A Fantastic Album,"This album is a classic, exemplifying Los Lobos' unique voice. Although all of the songs on the album are good, for my money, two songs really stand out: ""Emily"" and ""The Giving Tree."""
5,The book for Historians,"I first read this book from my fathers library in the late 1960's. In college I learned of the secret History underground that made knowledge of this book THE required text to understanding history.As another reviewer has written, this book could replace whole libraries of reference material. This is because Mr. Cuppy could reduce complex Ideas and Actions into a 6 word sentence. Few people can do it as well as he could.From time to time a writer will come out with Mr. Cuppy's style. The book, ""Hail to the Chiefs"", about American Presidents, is one of the best (Alas, it is out of print as well!).Find this book and enjoy your past. Then look at a dusty old tome and the latest news from Washington and have a good laugh."
5,The decline and fall of practically everbody,This book is history at its most humorous. Will Cuppy writes in a wry tongue in cheek manner. While his facts are true the way they are presented will leave the reader smilling if not laughing out loud.
2,Disappointing!,"Ricky Peterson's ""Look Who's Lonely Now"" recieved lots of airplay in the early 90's. Naturally, I purchased the cassette and expected more the same. Unfortunately, the album was a disappointment. What would have made the recording better was more music. Only 5 tracks? If all of the tracks wer 8 or 9 minutes in length, it would have been a different story. Aside from the successful track, ""Look..."", this is a downer."
3,Good to have a backup. Sometimes hard to use,The backup works great. Getting to the backup software is not ther easiest.
4,Well told and excellent explanations,I found the explanations and basic/simple stories in this book very amusing and helpful. Describes the history of evolution in simple language and tries to tackle the issue in a narrative and useful way. Great gift for your friends. Have bought it for several creationist people (whom I consider science retarded) and hope this book helps them find the truth. Though I think colored photos could be a lot better and effective.
1,Garbage!!!,"As other reviewers have stated, the pictured rack is not the one I received. The rack I received does not tilt and must be bolted together. The upper portion is attached to the lower portion with four bolts, which I checked before every trip. After less than 10 uses of this rack, two of the bolts sheared off while traveling on the interstate with two adult bikes and two childrens bikes. The rack snapped in half behind our motorhome, leaving us with $1,000 worth of destroyed bikes. Buyer beware!!!"
5,Good Rack,very well built and holds the bikes perfectly. mounted it on the back of my RV to carry bike around.
1,Item is not the one pictured! BEWARE!!!,"Thought I was ordering Swagman bike rack #64675 as picture corresponds to. Item was actually #64400- not what I wanted. I'm on vacation and had to 2 day ship item in order to get bikes back home to Indiana from Florida. The problem is that the item received does not tilt forward as the picture shows. Now on my trip home I must take off all 4 bikes AND remove hitch in order to get into my back hatch. I tried to call amazon hoping for a miracle, but no luck. I was told to order another for $179.68 and ship for $106.54 and I would get a $15 credit on my next purchase. Not exactly the miracle I was hoping for. Shame on Amazon for selling an item with the incorrect picture. Shame on me for not reading and knowing all of Swagmans parts #s."
3,A little expensive but a good product,"I have a gazebo and this fit in side perfectly. It was pretty easy to assembly, about 90 minutes. The only issue I have is that in order to feel any air, the speed needs to be on high and you have to be sitting directly under the fan blades. Of course, this was during 110 degree heat in the middle of a Las Vegas summer... so other parts of the world might not experience the same thing, considering physics and all. The base is very heavy and there is no threat of it falling or blowing over, even in very high winds. The price was a little high, but still happy with the purchase."
3,Excludes special features,"If you're expecting to get the special features, you'll be disappointed, because they're not available on this digital version. Otherwise, you can still get the bare bones episodes, which are okay I guess."
1,I liked it better when it was called seinfeld!!!,"Friends is such a rip off of seinfeld, they try to do the same episodes that seinfeld have already done! If you watch seinfeld you could tell that most of friends ideas came from seinfeld. Friends is just a replica!go think that friends is such a ground breaking show but remember seinfeld did it first!"
5,FINALLY!,"Finally this item is available for pre-order. I've been looking for this since I bought the ninth season. I am a big Friends fan and will finally have all ten seasons on DVD. It's worth it to get them all. I bought the DVD's then got cable and when I'm watching the episodes on TV, I can tell where really funny parts are omitted and only included on the DVD. For some side-splitting jokes and unforgettable scenes, buy the DVD's. Cable just isn't enough."
4,Just great!,"Ciao,""Friends"" is so funny, that I almost cried after the last episode. DVD quality very good, perhaps with the only waste of the 4th DVD, only dedicated to special features, with a 40 minutes ""gag reels"" and a 25 minutes ""behind the scene"": I'd have preferred the opposite, with more and more words from the actors.Still, a great unforgettable show."
2,not so perfect gift....,"as above.... I was looking to round out my daughter's series of the Friends collection. Was looking for the ""old"" style thick box so her entire collection would look the same on the shelf. Sure, the content of the dvd is the same so mark that as ""satisfied"" but I am still looking for the ""old style"" packaging. The picture of the 10th season on Amazon looked just like the picture of the 7th season so I thought I had made the right choice... NOT. I will be returning the 10th season."
4,Just got to complete our Friends collection.,"Not as good as earlier seasons, but we knew that. It has a lot of overacting and overuse of sexual innuendo."
4,Great,"I received this item before they said I would, which is always a great thing! I have yet to open it and watch the discs, but the packaging seems to be complete so I am sure they are fine."
4,Only one complaint,Wonderful series as always with the friends crew. My only complaint was that only 3 of the 4 disks in this season have episodes on them the last one is just commentary etc. I love Friends though so I had to have the last season to complete my collection.
4,Great like all the others!,"I love this one as much as all the others. I was a little sad that the only new gag reel was the tenth season and the much hyped extra time of outtakes were the same ones on the past season DVDs. The featurette on saying goodbye was a little short and they should have had more commentary because I love those. All in all, good fun, but I am just sad it is over."
5,Great!,"My wife loves this show. This is the second box set I got her, I couldn't be happier. Very funny show = very loving wife!!!"
2,The End Of the Most Overrated Show in the History of TV.,"Friends was not all bad, but it should have ended after six or seven seasons. Stretching a show when the story is already told is not a good idea. In particular, this season 10 was awful. You can tell it was a rush job. The scripts were weak, when they existed; the actors weren't there, it is obvious that they had enough and that they wanted it over with.The first seasons were OK. The show is still a replica of Seinfield, but maybe because of that we were watching. They should have followed Seinfield's example and leave when they were still having fun at the party. I guess $1M per episode was difficult to reject.Anyway, if you must watch season 10 episodes take advantage of the reruns. Do not waste your money."
1,Amazon on demand is awful,"We downloaded the last episode because the last DVD of our 10 season boxed set was left in somebody's DVD player.We used Amazon as our source because we prefer to do E-commerce with known entities.The quality we received was awful and although watchable...we now know how the series ends, it was a total disappointment. We have deleted the Amazon player from our PC and we will likely never use the service again."
5,Second part of gift - highly recommended,"It was a great deal. Amazon has a special buy two for a great price. It was really wanted as a gift, and I was just happy to have Amazon offer such a deal."
5,friends season 10,"I bought this for a friend for christmas she loves them. I plan on buying the whole set for her. Fast shipping, will be buying again."
5,Best Sitcom ever...,"I love sitcoms. Friends is the best sitcom. Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, David Schwimmer and Mathew Perry are the best actors and actress in the world. This sitcom is very funny! I love Jennifer Aniston she is the queen of sitcoms. What can i say?"
5,Friends tenth season...A Complete Celebration!!!!!,"Thank you amazon for pushing for the release of the tenth season how can we not have it to complete the friends legacy. Now they will live forever. I have all the seasons on DVD and it is worth it to own them. The re runs on TV just don't cut it. I can't wait to see Pheobe's Wedding again. That was just wonderful. When Chandler says ""you look Beautiful"" it took our collective breaths away. REJOICE FRIENDS FANS. Our friends will always be with us"
3,last episode,Great tv show and great episode only bought cause I couldnt find the episode anywhere else on the net otherwise I wouldnt have purchased lol
5,Excellent CD,"If you are looking for a great 80's hard rock CD, then look no further. Poison must have examined where there was success was coming from and went back to the formula of music that works best for them...straight up rock and roll. What most of you probably don't know, is that this CD was recorded in the mid 90's and buried by Capital Records, and never released. The guitarist on this CD is Blues Saraceno, argumentably the best of the Poison guitarists musically (no offense to C.C., or his fans). Blues absolutely shreds on this CD, and the music is a step above what most Poison fans are used to but not to far away that it destorts Poison's sound. This is just a killer CD and should be a reason for most Poison fans to rejoice. Bottomline, if you enjoy 80's Hard Rock Bands such as Poison, Motley Crue, Ratt or Warrant....you are going to love this CD. This one is a must own. I highly recommend it!"
4,Good to have them back...,"I have been into Poison's music since the beginning. I must say that this album shows the progression of their musical growth over the years... and I can't wait to hear a more recent sample.The first three tracks are the strongest on the album. The cover of Dr. Hook is hysterical and a fresh outtake of an old favorite. Die hard fans won't be disappointed by the new material on this album, and new ones will be impressed."
5,POISON'S Lost CD finds way to the public!,"Poison returns to the top with a 1995 recordered, delayed and cancelled CD. This is Poison sounding as good as ever with big chorussy songs, lots of attitude and great lyrics. Bret, Bobby, Rikki and Blues has put out a great set of tunes!"
3,It's about time,"I love Poison and I have been waiting for this album to get released. I was kind of disappointed. The album is good but not great. The best song on there is ""Face the Hangman"" which is a cut from the old days. I actually think Native Tongue is better than this. It just goes to show that CC is needed to make POISON sound like POISON."
5,The best from Poison,"The long awaited ""lost"" Poison album is finally here. It was well worth the wait. This is easily their best effort. The production on the album is very full as opposed to the thin sound on earlier Poison albums. The songwriting and musicianship is the strongest I have heard from them. In particular, Rikki Rocket and Bobby Dall succeed in providing a tight and heavy foundation that the songs are built upon. My only regret being that Poison are now taking 2 steps backward music-wise by rehiring CC Deville and dumping Blues Saraceno. Saraceno gave Poison a much needed boost in the lead guitar department. This album is well worth the investment. Welcome back guys!"
5,worth it's weight in gold,"I had heard samples of this album a few years back and I anticipated it's release in 1994? And now almost 5 years later it has been released.. This has to be if not the best poison studio album ever from this group since open up and say ahh.The band has grown and matured in their songwriting but have also acquired Blues Saraceno to take over the axe work. He is absolutely brilliant in this album very emotional and the guitar work just grooves everywhere respectively. Brett and the rest of the guys sound great as ever unlike,Don Dokken and Stephen Pearcy who can't sing very well anymore,brett hasn't lost a touch. I recommend this to all who love good ol' heavy metal rock'n roll. Buy this if you are a fan, and if you are not you will become one with no doubt. Long live america's true rock bands!"
2,For a fan of good old Poison...pass.,"This album has some decent songs on it, that I'll say. But, it stops there. When a cd can barely get me into 2 songs, it needs work. This is Poison attempting a Punk/Blues album combo and for me it just doesn't do it. I don't automatically like EVERYTHING Poison puts out just because they are a favorite band of mine. This is NOT classic Poison and Bret changes his vocals WAY TOO much. Not to mention no CC input on this album. CC really does help the band out alot."
2,It's ok.,CD is in really good condition just not all that crazy about the songs. Like their more rocking tunes. Could have been better.
5,A powerful package,"Although Capitol shafted these guys, this cd was packaged very well. The sheer number of tracks alone make it worth the price of admission and better yet, they all rock. The only problem I have is that the first single is 'Shut up, make love' when it should have been 'Baby gets around a bit' which is better, sounds more like Poison and is catchier. The 'Cover of a Rolling Stone' remake is a hoot! All 4 Unplugged songs sound great! All of the demos/outtakes overall are very good. 'No ring, no gets' sounds the most like the old Poison material. The album goes to show that there was life after CC. Some could argue that this is their strongest studio material since ""Flesh and Blood."" I am into ""Native Tongue"" so myself I won't say either way. Quality album, worth the money, I promise. The best part is that even though this material was recorded over the 1994-1996 period, it all still sounds fresh."
2,Darren d.,lone wolf cd is ok. two song`s that i like.( lone wolf and man to man).the song`s on this cd to me was not all that good. It seem like when he got older his song`s change to.ok cd but not to ROWDY. THANK YOU.
1,Breaksdown in couple of months,"I purchased this product because of its compact design which is perfect for my travelling job. It worked wonderfully in the beginning, but it started acting crazy after a couple of months. It double clicked on its own when I clicked only once (which is annoying when everything you click pops open). Then it started to lose the optical signal and then it just died.Luckily, it was still under warranty, so I got my replacement. However within 8 months, it broke down again (having the same problem). So I contacted Targus again. But this time they would not replace it because they only replace during the 1 year warranty of the original purchase. It's not like I abused it. I took good care of it. It sucks that Targus will not stand behind their product 100%.Don't purchase this if you don't want to shell out more money to replace every couple of months."
1,Worse quality from targus ever,This has happened to me for 2 of these mouse now (bought via corporate procurement so NO choice of mouse). One click becomes a double click randomly (within 6 months). I replaced 2 since it came with the Targus warranty (one for me and one for my colleague). One of the replacement mouse which also developed a double click problem has now died with no lights (in less than 2 years).And the Targus warranty allows you to replace each mouse ONCE ONLY. And the other replacement mouse is left unopened as no one wants to use it!!!Do not waste your money with this mouse unless you want to pay only for less than 6 months of normal usage.
4,Notebook Optical Mouse w/Rectractable USB Cable,"Mouse works perfectly, and the only complaint I would have is that it's very narrow where your fingers normally reside. Perfect for her, but if you have big hands they may get tired after any long period of use. I love the wheel, which makes no noise and scroll quick."
1,not great,the cord continually retracts..it does not lock into place after being extended. its very frustrating. i wanted to return it but its the only mouse my son has and he didnt want to wait for a new one to be sent.perhaps a new one could be sent anyway....this one if sent back came broken and probably not resellable.
4,"Really, how can you go wrong?","Possibly one of the best action movies of all time, you really can't go wrong with it, but that's true of the movie in any format. As for the HD-DVD format, this is a bare-bones DVD, but in my view that's fine. I want to watch the movie, I don't want to see all the behind the scenes stuff, hear what the director was thinking and look at still pictures from the set, but if that's what you're looking for, then you won't find it here.The remaster to HD seems to have been quite good, but remember, this was filmed in the 80s, so don't expect to see the same level of clarity you'll get from something filmed on an HD pro camera today. Still, definately a cut above the non-HD format and well worth the purchase."
4,Great hd dvd creation,"I need not mention anything about the movie, only that the transfer/scan to hd resolution was done extremely well with no noticeable scratches or artifacts. The sound quality, especially the DTS track, was flawless and impressive. If you like the movie, or more likely the aircraft, this is a highly recommended item to purchase."
2,Not Impressed,"I like Top Gun as a movie. A good balance of action, comedy, personal interactions. So my rating is not based on the movie itself - you either like Top Gun or not. My comments are about technical issues only - namely 3-D conversion. Briefly, not impressed. Very poor conversion in my opinion. There were a couple of good 3-D effects in some flying sequences but just a couple. Definitely not the quality of Avatar, most cartoons, and a multitude of others (I own about 40 3-D titles). I see no benefit to this conversion and advise not to buy it if you already have a good DVD or Blu-Ray copy. You will not gain anything. This is the first 3-D movie I can honestly say that if Amazon would let me return it even though I watched it I would have it back in the mail immediately with priority return shipping."
3,Top Gun 3-D DVD,Well I was a little disappointed in the 3-D. It does seem a little crisper but nothing to write home about. Still a good movie just don't plan on being wowed by the 3-D part of it.
1,Ugh!,"This is a good movie...for people with double-digit I.Q.'s, and the attention-spans of three year-olds."
1,A TRUE SHOCKER!,"This one goes in the can as one of the all time worst films ever to be made. Tom Cruise once again proves that he can play Tom Cruise with impeccable simplicity, and is mind numbingly dumb enough in this film to suck like minded idiots in. This film is ten years behind it's release date in every facet of film making, not to mention the appalling social commentary we are ment to lap up like a bunch of salivating neanderthals. No, I haven't lost that lovin feeling, but I was glad when Goose died! I wish maverick did too!"
4,"Tom Cruse, Top Gun (Blu Ray)","I thiought that the movie was of blu ray quality, but the wrapping was not of USA, This is because the product is a UK imported one. This is one reason i am very dissatisfatied with this company."
1,Total Garbage!!!!,"Unlike the previous ""Viewer from US"", this is not realistic Navy life. This movie is so distorted it is laughable. Watch this movie as a comedy, not anything approaching reality. It's a total Tony Scott MTV commercialization (which he ueses again in ""Revenge""). The only redeeming quality are the flying sequences (which are to take place over water, yet you can see the mountains in the background). For more realism watch ""Red Flag"" with Barry Bostwick, even though it may still be only seen on TV."
4,Its Top Gun,Its early Cruise and Kilmer with fast planes in HD. It doesn't get much better than this.
4,Still Good,"An MTV movie really, but still good. Looking back, yes it is a weak plot but everything looks cool: the jets, the men, the car, and even the woman. The movie alone drove more men to join the Navy than all the enlisting officers combined. Plus, the soundtrack is still good music. Though I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan-this is the film that launched him into stardom (more than Ricky business--and certainly more than the Dark Crystal.)"
3,FIRST OF ALL...,"First of all, nobody is obliged to produce a masterpiece every time one goes behind a camera. No. So, TOP GUN is not a masterpiece, but sure as hell it will give you good moments in a silly script. Cruise is doing what he knows best: false acting."
4,Wonderful,It is wonderful. It is funny and thrilling it is a great movie. I don't think many kids would like it but I did because I love fighter planes. The actors do a great job and it is a wonderful story.
5,What's not to love?,Face it: It's Top Gun.Double disc set with special features. Some behind the scenes features actually taught me something I didn't know about one of my favorite movies.
2,This is supposed to be high definition????,"I'm going to get right to the point. First off this is a great movie especially if the F-14 is your favorite aircraft. However the picture looks the same as it did when I used to watch this on a 19"" inch TV in the late 80's on a rented VHS tape. Paramount should be ashamed, this is not even close to 720 let alone 1080. I have old DVD's that offer a better picture in the bluray player then this. Yes it does have a cool menu but the picture is NOT high-Def and the sound is only acceptable when you put the setting on 6.1 DTS Master (only reason I gave 2-stars). If you do not have a good external speaker system do not waste your money because the picture and the sound won't be worth it."
4,Excellent movie but want the best sound,This used to be the best movie to demonstrate the sound of a home theater. But now that sound in movies have greatly improved I'm hoping for a new revised version of Top Gun that has been digitally remastered.
2,Great Movie - Where's the Pepsi Add?,"I have Top Gun on Laser Disc and VHS, and thought it would be great to get on DVD. What a mistake. This DVD does have great sound and picture (better than the laser disc), but the extras are missing. Paramount Studios released a DVD without the great Pepsi commerical. There are NO production notes or making of. I will be very disappointed if Paramount Studios releases this movie again without the extras. They should have done it right the first time."
5,A NAVY RECRUITING FILM,"""Top Gun"", starring Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in 1986, was a glamorous showcase film for the Navy. Actual Navy recruiters set up shop in theatre lobbies, signing up young hopefuls filled with visions of drinking beer while singing ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"", making afternoon delight with Kelly McGillis, while tear-assing through the skies like a bat out off freedom.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
2,Best movie ever made??,"It's hard to believe that anyone considers this the best movie ever made. It has action, but so do many other much better movies. It's mostly just nonsense about some cocky guys who can't sing--literally couldn't carry a tune in a bucket--and a somewhat silly love affair. I'm all for romance, but puh-leeease!"
5,Forget the reviewers who say this movie is bad it's great!,"Why is everyone sayin Top Gun is a bad movie? It is not it's the best movie of the 80's. There's nothing wrong with this movie. I mean everyone I know loves it. It has all the genres like comedy, drama, action, and romance. They could be just not an 80's lover. I'm a 80's lover and I love movies from 80's like Back to the Future, Better off Dead, Revenge of the Nerds, The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Can't Buy Me Love, Adventures in Babysitting, and definetly Top Gun. There are some more but those are my favorite ones. Top Gun is absouletly one of my favs. I own the DVD and it's a classic! It's still fun to watch."
1,Poor Picture Quality,"Bought the Blu-ray 3D version. 3D is so so, but the picture quality is grainy like watching a copy of a VHS tape."
1,Too bad they did such a cheap job with the Blu-ray edition,"Sure, the sound is great ... but that is no excuse for simply re-hashing the DVD video: its still a cropped version of what was on the big screen. Too bad."
2,"Don't buy this DVD, buy ""The Story of Top Gun""","Such a great movie, and a featureless DVD! Hopefully, a Special Edition DVD is in the works.However, The Story of Top Gun is a great DVD about the real Top Gun school. Buy it NOW! And, no, I am not getting any kick-backs for recommending it."
3,Oldie but Not-So-Goodie,"I first saw Top Gun in the theater when I was in the 7th grade. It was AWESOME! Watching it almost 25 years later, I can't figure out what the hype was about. The story and aerial dogfights made for good Saturday matinee popcorn fare, but it wouldn't hold up in today's market. As far as the Hi-Def version of the movie goes, I was happy. The aerial scenes weren't shot in Panavision and you can tell the film quality wasn't as good. The rest of the picture is pretty great, as is the sound. The Blu-ray version uses the same transfer."
4,Still one of the best action movies of all time,"I remember watching it back in 1986 when it first came out and I was hooked. I watched it over and over again and made up my mindthat when I turned 18, I would join the military. But due to my health issues, I was unable to join. I still love this movie and would recommend it to anyone to loves *good* action movies."
3,hollywood-ish dogfights,"the movie follows a very predictable formula of personal high, hit rock bottom then recover-at-the-end flow. impressive movie back then during its days but watching it over and over makes me want more out of the end dogfight scenes. [why did they include a-6 footages to show maverick in waiting at the catapults? clearly, the tomcat and the intruder have different undercarriage looks] nice sounds though....i like watching it for the thunderous sounds of the navy jets...nice cinematography on pilot rescue and tied-down tomcat on carrier deck...pick up a copy of the documentary dvds ""the story of top gun"" and firepower2000 if you're into military aviation..."
3,For aircraft fans,"If you like aircraft and you want to see stunning air combat that is your movie. If you want a drama, better look for something else.A cheap drama is a good excuse for an impressive footage."
2,I demand re-release of this dvd.,"4:3 ratio screen is very good transfer. However, wide-screen isn't really wide screen. it's a 4:3 screen chopped off from top and bottom. in other word, instead of having a whole theatrical picture, what you get is picture that's been chopped up both vertical and horizontally. what we are seeing is only 1/3 of what's filmed, which is even smaller than 4:3. somebody cheated big time from paramount. setup menu is false leading. I want to see entire wing span on F-14! It does make huge difference on impact in fighting scene. movie this good must be done right. and while at it, make it a anamorphic enhanced."
4,Top Gun,"I own the VHS version and now the DVD. The flying scenes are among the best I've ever seen in any movie. If you have a DVD player in your home theatre system with surround-sound, don't miss out on this action packed movie. The sounds are incredible! I've watched this movie 30 times and still haven't grown tired of it!"
2,"Great sound, poor video","Well, this was really a mixed bag for me. Top Gun was always one of my favorite movies growing up, and I've owned it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. The lack of aspect ratio information on the box is quite telling, as there is no TRUE widescreen - all video is letterboxed, even on a 16:9 HD LCD TV. The ""widescreen"" is simply a cropped version of the full screen edition, with black bars. This was very disappointing to me, as I was hoping for some full 1080 F-14 action.That said, the EXCELLENT DTS 6.1 sound track nearly makes up for the visuals. The encoding seems theater-pure, and is one of the best BD audio tracks I've heard. It's really astonishing how defined the audio is, especially the spatial effects and rumble during the flying sequences. Simply superb audio.Hopefully, Paramount can dig up a better quality version of the master and give us a TRUE widescreen, full HD experience for Top Gun. Until then, this is the best that we've got."
2,Bad Copy,"I have now owned this movie on VHS, DVD, and now BD. Unfortunately, the copy from the masters is rather grainy for HD. The audio is outstanding, but again, while it obviously looks better than a DVD, this might be one of the worst BD's I've seen since they came out. I know that the masters are 20 years old, but the BD of Halloween looks AMAZING, and that movie is 30 years old. I must admit that I had high hopes, and was a little dissapointed. My reccomendation would be wait until they release the ""Special Edition,"" which I'm sure they undoubtedly will.Side note: extras are all in SD."
5,a classic reborn,"I am so glad they put this in HD, I LOVED this movie. I still think it is one of the best movies Tom ever did...pre-crazy Tom or not.For the stooges who downgraded the movie because it was on HD, get a life. There are tons of great movies on Blu-Ray that I cannot watch because I don't plan to be the dupe that pays $700 for a DVD player. That said, I still don't bash movies or studios for choosing one format over the other...it is what it is...So, if you are financially sound-minded, and can afford the >$300 for a HD Player....this is a must have movie!!!"
1,Widescreen format is a joke,"The widescreen version of this movie, is actually just the full screen version with the top and bottom replaced with black bars. This means even more is cropped from the movie, and you actually see even LESS than the full screen. This is fraudulent, and the video and sound quality are mediocre. It's a real shoddy job for such a good movie."
1,AWFUL TRANSFER,"The quality of the transfer on the blue ray disc I have was awful-one of the worst I have seen for grain. I use a sony PS3 blue ray player and a sharp elite 70"" led tv which is basically a referance tv set. To get the ascpect ration the film was cropped top and bottom from original but its the grain that is plain awful. The sound track rocks however and makes up for the picture quality somewhat. As a comparision I put in my original DVD and let my new set up convert the quality and it looked just as good as the blur ray version. The 3d is very nice and its a real shame that this picture did not get the treatment it deserves. Hopefully with a new top gun in the works in a few years maybe we will see a new release with the original up to snuff but until then avoid this disc if you have a quality set."
3,3D disc has some issues,"As others have noticed, there are some areas of this 3D transfer that are really grainy. But its odd because it will look absolutely beautiful on the next scene. The grainy stuff is NOT the entire film, but there are a number of sub-par scenes where its pretty bad.Having said that, the 3D effect is quite good...considering the age of this movie. The 3D is no Avatar, but I was impressed for sure. The flight ops sections are excellent and are worth buying the 3D copy."
3,Don't waste the $1 on HD,"Top Gun is a classic, and I couldn't wait to share the movie with my son who is a HUGE plane enthusiast. Since we have a nice big-screen TV and watch television and other movies in HD, it made sense to rent the HD version of this film. BIG mistake! Sure, it was only a dollar more than the SD version, but I'm fairly certain that the HD conversion actually made the quality WORSE. In the future, we'll rent pre-HD-era movies withOUT the HD enhancement. The movie itself was awesome and we watched it 3 times during our 24-hour rental!"
1,SPECULATIVE FANTASY?,"It never ceases to amaze me that some people actually beleve ""TOP GUN"" has a basis in reality. Because it doesn't. ""STAR TREK"" rings truer than ""TOP GUN"". Go back to High School young men, and maybe someday maybe you'll get a drivers licencse. If you think you can race your Kawasaki against a jet aircraft down the runway on a military installation without getting shot...then maybe its too late for you already. Get real! Get your G.E.D."
3,Miracles do happen...,"This film is so horrible, it would take an army of men, nae Gods, armed with Guitars and Synthesizers to make it in anyway enjoyable. Amazingly, that's just what happened"
2,Annoying,"I found the whole male macho thing annoying. I do like traditional 'guy' movies, but this one lacks class, the main roles are spoiled little boys."
1,Didn't work,"I ordered Top Gun and it would not play in my Panasonic 3D DVD player, I sent it back and ordered another copy with the same results, it didn't play either. I'll get it from Target the next time I go there."
1,"Crash the Plane, Already","Arggghhh! I was so disappointed by this one. Somehow I was lead to believe that this ""classic"" was going to be entertaining. I curse the people who recommended this to me. The only consolation throughout the entire movie is Tom Cruise's presence, but even that gets old. And if I have to hear that damned ""Take my Breath Away"" one more time, I'm going to scream. I'm sure you're a busy person. Don't waste your time. And don't exert the effort of putting this one in the VCR and pressing play. It bites. In a big way."
4,Good deal,I always liked this movie. Price was right and got it in two days. Will do business again.
2,Disappointing - Save Your Money For a Real 3D Flick,"Bought this in anticipation of great 3D depth in the movie's dogfighting scenes. Wrong- the 3D action scenes werre no better than watching a 2D movie with a 3D upconverter. VERY disappointing.Leson to be learned here: approach with much lowered expectations, any movie not originally shot in true, dual camera 3D. In fact, don't buy them at all."
1,Not worth the money to upgrade!,"Always liked this movie and was excited to see that it was be re-released in 3D BluRay. Well it is 3D, but the quality is horrible. The picture in some spots looks like VHS. The picture in the best spots looks no better than DVD.I'm learning that I shouldn't spend good money to upgrade DVD films to 3D or Blu Ray."
2,POOR 3D,I was all excited about getting this movie because I really liked the orginal movie so getting it in 3D WOW!! Notta for the most part of the movie it really didn't matter if you had on your 3D glass's or not. In fact the best 3D parts I felt were in the credits of the movie I was really disapointed. But this is mine and my wife's view. Would I recommend it to someone else? No!!
3,Top Gun Vhs.,"Tom Cruise in Top Gun, Good movie, with good Footage, cool Jets. and good goofy music. ""Highway to the danger zone"" ? I guess cool at the time. good movie, not great unless your a cruise fan."
5,Great Movie - I ordered the HD DVD,Great movie and should be great in HD. Order the HD DVD version because Paramount made a business decision to not produce any more Blu-ray discs.
3,Great 3d...except that..,"One of my favorite movies gets a 3D upgrade? Sign me up! Pretty excited to see this show up; and picked it up immediately. First thing that became apparent is that the film is GRAINY--to the point that my wife, who hardly notices the differences between DVD and Bluray,, commented immediately, and assumed the movie was defective. Any time there was a dark scene, you could almost COUNT the grain particles--it it literally one of the worst Bluray transfers I have ever seen. Shame on Paramount for letting this go out in this condition. The 3d itself is fine, particularly in the final half hour (which is very bright, so no grain showing up). Overall, somewhat disappointing release. Would have only gotten 2 stars, but Kelly McGillis adds one more."
2,chopped off heads,"DONT BUY IT, great blu ray quality. but it zooomed up and u will see the screen with some chopped off forheads and background. It'll tick u off... even with amazon cheap prices.... u will be man. Wait til they re-make the blu ray disk. DONT BUY THIS BLU RAY."
5,Better then ever.,"Top Gun is an amazing movie plain and simple. I watched it 3 times on VHS in a row the first time I saw it. Its the perfect movie to watch with a girlfriend because it offers enough action and romance to keeps both parties interested. But i'm sure this has all been said before, the real question is ""Is it worth it on blue ray?"" My awnser, ABSOLUTELY. The movie looks better then ever, the blue's and oranges have been tweaked but it gives the movie a more vibrant modern look. The plains look amazing, and the in cockpit views provide some of the best detail images of any blue-ray movie released. The the visuals and audio experience manages to keep up with todays standards while still keeping the charm that made the movie so great to begin with. Whether your a old fan or a new one, this movie remains top notch, and is definitly worth the upgrade to blu-ray."
5,way cool,This movie was the best. I have watched it over and over and never get board. It is way cool.
5,The best movie ever created.,"Top Gun is the best movie ever. All because of this movie I want to become a pilot. I watch it 15-20 times a month. It's great, a must see."
5,The BEST of the best,"This is my favorite movie of all time! Most people don't believe me when I tell them I've watched it over 30 times, but yeah, I think 30 is about right.This movie has everything, an interesting plot, characters you can relate to, action, drama, comedy, yeah ok, some romance too, but the awsome action sceens, the fights in the air (not to mention the ones on the ground) are really what make this movie so great.I would recommend this movie to everyone, I have never met anyone in their right mind that didn't enjoy it. It will keep you on the edge of your seat untill the very end!"
4,"I'm Sorry, But This Movie Is Awesome","Nope, it is definately not oscar material. Nobody will ever be lauded for their performance as an actor for this film. It is cliched and corny.WHO THE HELL CARES, THOUGH?This is one of the most fun and carefree movies of the last 15 years. Studly heros, sexy babes, ridiculous one-liner driven cliched diologue (I probably could recite the whole thing from beginnong to end, though!) What more could you want? Oh, OK, I guess we'll put in some awesome f-14 dogfights and some cheesy 80's rock music. Satisfied? Yes, now we have the perfect ""watch it in your dorm some afternoon with all your buddies"" film.All I can say is:When it first came out on video, me and my dad rented it almost every weekend untill we broke down and bought it like 3 months later.Buy a couple of 'em, just in case you break one!"
3,"not tops, but alright","Eh, I don't know about the original Top Gun. I just watched it yesterday for the first time in forever, and I wasn't really happy with it. The part in the beginning where Tom Cruise tries to hit on what would obviously become his girlfriend a short time later was rather pointless, not to mention uninteresting.The whole bar scene with Cruise singing to her, trying to win her over... not very good writing. And the part where he followed her to the ladies room? Please!The actual air combat was good though. The emotions with the guys up in the sky and living dangerously was solid writing because it kept my interest. But the overlong emotional scenes involving Cruise and his girlfriend weren't necessary. Should have been more about taking the planes to the sky instead of a predictable romance that we seen coming a mile away."
2,The soundtrack is pretty good.,"Topgun is like one of those WW II military propaganda films critics now hate. But the irony is WWII propaganda movies had a purpose, and the real problem is Topgun just isn't any good. It's cute simply because the film has NO basis in reality. For jet planes-insert-rockets ships to mars-or maybe-racing cars-? The cast of two dimensional characters can't help a bad idea, BUT the sound track is pretty good.Hindsight shows us that Tom Cruise has been-in general-playing the same guy for the last-what-19 years. Whether he's acting at flying a jet or flying a bar, he still plays the same grinning, depthless character. The last time TC really acted was in ""Rainman,"" and sadly he was passed over.Topgun like an injured horse should be put to sleep."
2,Blu-ray no improvement here,"I bought Top Gun on Blu-Ray as my first BD disc, in part because it was relatively inexpensive, but also because I was excited to see the dogfight sequences in high def.Unfortunately, it looks to me like only the dialog sequences were improved by the change in format. The dogfights, the carrier take-offs and landings, and the other scenes with the (still cool and exciting F14 Tomcat) look like they are in standard def.With that disappointment, it was hard to get excited by this movie. The dialog is so painfully cheesy that unless you are are teenager, there was no real reason to watch it in the first place."
2,Enough cheese to cause heart disease,"Yes, this film deserves credit for the technical work on the flying scenes. I won't repeat all the reasons for not having much respect for the film (they're all here) but for those of you with sharp eyes: Watch over Cruise's left shoulder when he's flying. That brass wheel is a tool used to separate the main beam from the catapult when disassembling the ejection seat. (Strike 1!) Also - the ""MiG-28"" (AKA an American-built Northrop F-5 Tiger) has two guns, yes, but they're in the nose. (Strike 2!) Finally, anyone that reckless wouldn't be trusted with a government vehicle, never mind a fighter aircraft. (Strike 3!) So... its a fun movie in a comic-book sort of way, but don't take it seriously, it will only make one's head hurt."
1,Top Gun Stream,"This is a great movie, lots of action and great acting. And then there's Kenny Loggins music. Sound isn't great, and no CC. When you are half deaf CC makes the viewing experience much more enjoyable. This stream isn't HD, but not too bad. Encoding is poor. Buy the DVD for $7.50, don't pay for this stream."

1,poor,the movie stopped halfway thru and wouldn't play the rest of the way. the movie itself is great but would have like to finish the movie.
1,Poor product period... Video and sound awful,"Not what I expected at all . The video quality is that of VHS , sound sucks too... Completely disgusted ... Ordered two more movies from amazon , hope they aren't pirated like this one"
3,Amazon disappoints me...,"After I preordered this blu ray and waited over a month, it finally ships, then I see the price drops 33% the day after it ships out. Pretty shady, or did I just learn an amazon buying lesson the hard way? No more preordering on my part, thanks amazon."
1,Lame movie.,"What can I say about Top Gun? This is an over the top movie that is replete with lousy acting, slipshod story writing, and is wanting in creativity, style, and quality. Perhaps it is because this movie is 20 years old that much of it appears to be outdated, but it does seem as though there could have been more improvements. Of course, CGI technology was not as advanced back then, so it is hard to hold the movie to such a high standard. Perhaps the worst part of Top Gun are the hackneyed lines that are contained throughout the movie. The lines could have been written by any immature 13-year-old boy with a lot of spare time on his hands. Although the creators of the movie obviously intended the movie to be timeless, they did a very poor job of it. This is the worst military-oriented movie ever created. For those seeking a higher quality military movie, I highly recommend Full Metal Jacket."
5,top gun,all i can say is do not buy anything from amazon. com because although this one came we ordered season 4 of two& a half men they shipped it twice or at least they said they did after waiting 3& a half months for the dvd to arrive it never did their customer service was very rude and were either unable & unwilling to help us with this matter we went to wal mart & picked it up with no problem & it only took them one week to get it for us amazons service stinks.
4,TOP GUN - Blu-Ray,"I saw TOP GUN in the theater, owned it on VHS & DVD, this blu-ray I just bought for $10.00 is no doubt the best I've seen and heard. I love this movie even more now than ever before. What really amazed me is how great the surround audio is, the audio on DVD disappointed me big time and thank goodness, this blu-ray made up for it, what a superb upgrade even with the video. I love the aerial and F-14 shots, Tony Scott really made a magnificent job with it, in my opinion, along with the great surround sound, it makes you feel like you're sitting right there inside that cockpit. I love this blu-ray and I highly recommend it, it will make a great addition to your movie library. Thank you, Paramount, for giving this movie the superb upgrade it deserves."
4,"A good ""show off"" DVD.","Top Gun has enough action, top stars, and plot to interest just about anyone - especially Tom Cruise fans. It's also a good DVD to show off your Dolby Digital sound system. The roar of the jets during the fighter sequences will have you worrying about your plaster coming loose and your subwoofer overheating. I'd give this a full 5 stars, but there are no extra features on the DVD. But the picture and sound quality still make it worth having."
4,top fun!!!,"Average movie, but really cool in bluray, great to see the non crazy tom cruise.... Kelly mcgillis looked grrrrrreat...special effects still hold up all these years later"
4,Top Gun!!!,"It's Top Gun, what's not to love about it? 80's flashback anyone? What I loved more was seeing the same blu-ray cheaper at walmart the night after I placed my order..."
5,It's Top Gun!,"Dur! Of coarse it's 5 stars! It's not exactly the same video quality as more modern movies, but Blu-ray isn't a magic wand. The audio is awesome, though... I feel bad for my neighbors!"
2,Very dissapointed TOP GUN fan,"The two stars are not for the film itself. TOP GUN is a classic among classic military, guy films. The two stars is for the vain attempt to create a 3D transfer of the film. Granted, it is a great idea in concept...unfortunatley in execution it becomes clear that this is a ""bridge to far."" There is little to no visibly discernable 3D in the film (mainly the wide angle shots of the aircraft carrier). The picture quality itself is pratically the same as the original. The only true enhancement was to the sound. Is that enough to shell the extra cash for a ""3D"" (note the use of quotes) combo pack? No, its not."
4,Good conversion,"The 3D conversion was very well done. I didn't care for some of the film grain on some scenes, however the added depth was fantastic."
3,"Top Gun's a classic, but save some money & get it on DVD","One of my alltime favorite movies, I was hoping it would be worth having on Bluray, but as in most cases with films not just made there really is no big difference between the DVD & Bluray versions (at least, not so far as what I've come across).The movie's a definite must have for any collection, but get it on DVD if you can find it cheaper."
4,STILL TOP,The photography of the planes in flight are still very good. Color and the print hold up. The story seemed to fit better than I remembered when it first hit the scene.
1,Unfortunately,"I have tryed Top Gun HD DVD in fourdifferant DVD player's same errormessage, did not recognize it?Sincerely;Eldon Hart"
1,Top Schlock,"This movie is about a bunch of snot-nosed brats who get airplanes, period. They have cute nicknames like ""goose"", ""ace"" and ""chunk style"" (okay, I made that last one up, but you get the point). Although these brats are supposed to be America's elite pilots they fly around whooping and treating our millitary's top aircraft as toys. Plot and tension are sacrificed to give you, well, more flying, whooping and grinning by the aformentioned brats. Oh yeah, there's dirty parts too. All in all, if real millitary pilots are anything like the yahoos in this movie we'll be in a lot of trouble when the next war starts."
2,Lame and corny,"When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. Now that twenty years have passed, all I can say is that it is so lame and corny that it's kind of embarrassing admitting that I used to like it so much. Sure I still get a kick out of state-of-the-art (back then, at least) aircraft steaking all over the place, engaged in dogfights and all that... but that's about it. The whole story is really half-baked, and not much good can be said about the acting. If you haven't seen this movie yet, trust me, you haven't missing much and I'd recommend not wasting your time on it."
1,TOP GUN is rock bottom,"All formula, from aerial shots (not any of which are impressive or original) to acting. I like Tom Cruise as an actor but he does not a thing for this atrocious, utterly predictable flying picture. A real crash for all concerned."
4,One more reason I love DVD...,"Top Gun is not a realistic depiction of life as a Navy Pilot. The plot is predictable and Tom Cruise played the same cocky kid he played in every movie he was in in the 80's. With that said, I must say that I love this movie. Young men across the country can quote this movie line for line - Some of the sharpest, most clever dialogue ever. The soundtrack fits perfectly and still sounds fresh over a decade later. The DVD version is FABULOUS. The Dolby 5.1 sound and crystal-clear picture bring this experience to a new level. (Try reading the names on the jets - as they fly by...) This movie should be a mandatory addition to anyone's DVD collection."
1,"Love the movie, but this disc had serious issue about 54 minutes in","Love the movie and the 3D is terrific, but this disc had serious issues about 54 minutes in. Received replacement from Amazon and it had the same issues ---- screen stopping, unable to continue. Suspect it's just a bad batch of DVD's ... will re-order after that batch clears out."
4,One for the collectors,"This is one of the first DVD's I've ordered when I got my DVD system. It's always been one of my favorite movies, so I knew I would have to have it in my collection. The action sequences are great, and my mates like it too. The video quality on DVD is OK, and the roar of the fighter jets is absolutely awesome in Dolby Surround Sound. When you want to show your mates why you spent the extra bucks for a subwoofer, this movie rocks."
5,Love this Movie!!!,Absolutely love this movie! My husband knows the words by heart! I would recommend this movie every time. Tom Cruise is a hunk!!!
4,Top Gun,I watched this movie for the first time a couple years ago and I thought it was pretty good. It's one of those movies that you just have to watch but it didn't completely knock my socks off. I always have thought Tom Cruise is really corny!
5,best movie ever!,awesome collectors edition. comes with the case and a paper case over it. looks wonderful. my husband loved it. =)
3,See it for the amazing cinematography in the aerial scenes.,"This movie has great cinematography in the air dogfight scenes, and a great, loud soundtrack. It also has one of the most embarrassing lines in filmdom when McGillis says, ""I was afraid they'd see that I'd fallen for you."" It is clear that the character ""Goose"" will be, as the movie parody ""Hot Shots"" named his counterpart, dead meat, but Anthony Edward's acting is dead on for the spirit of this movie. Tom Skerritt also brings good acting. Otherwise, you can use the chapter skip or fast forward features of your DVD player to bypass the very unlikely and unconvincing romantic subplot and Cruise's prolonged crying scenes in the last quarter of the film."
4,Highway to the Danger Zone,This movie is awesome! What a classic. Just need to remake the movie in HD and not upconverted HD.
4,JazzMan51,"I was lucky enough to see Top Gun when it was in the Theaters, Wow!! Tom cruise was at his peak. Kelly McGillis was awesome. The soundtrack by berlin was to die for !! Man it was so good in HD !."
5,One of the best movies from the 80's,This movie has it all! from great fighter plane action to inspiration! and more.... great balls of fire!
5,this is the one where he plays the cockey young guy,"A classic, and a great DVD, especially if you have a widescreen TV to handle it. Plus, what other movie do you want to put a surround sound system to the test?"
5,DVD,"Received product within the time stated at time of purchase. DVD arrived in new condition, with no defects. I am always satisfied with products bought through Amazon.com and their sellers."
5,"Tom Cruise + Volleyball = yes, please","The only acceptable reason for not watching this film is because you are still busy watching ""Tommy Boy."""
5,great deal!,Very pleased to get a classic DVD for the price I payed. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
3,Need for speed.,"Top Gun starring Tom Cruise was a huge hit when it was released in 1986. I like this movie for all the action and romance but I wouldn't say it is the best film of the decade. Too bad Kelly McGillis didn't have a lasting career, she is so confident and her performance is relaxed and subtle. I also enjoy Anthony Edwards in this, he's just a cool guy. Top Gun is fun for what it is but this blockbluster does have its flaws."
4,Top Gun - Mini Review,"The macho students of an elite US Flying school for advanced fighter pilots compete to be best in the class, and one romances the teacher."
3,"Great Music, Shame About The Film","This should have been a great film after all it is directed byTony Scott, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and has one of the best scores of the eighties, or indeed any other decade, composed as it is by Harold Faltermeyer (Beverly Hills Cop I & II), not as some seem to think Giorgio Moroder. However not even the dramatic flight sequences and terrific score can save this film overrun as it is with romance and sentimentality, which slows down the pace of the film unnecessarily. Buy this DVD only for the improved sound quality. Pity it doesn't contain more special features, such as isolated score..."
2,not worth the money,"they claim that it is worth $350. I paid $49 on a gold box deal and I still think I paid too much. The chronograph does not line up at zero. It is ""water resistant"" which they define as resistant to a few rain drops only -- you cannot even take it into a shower. It looks like a $50 watch and I would certainly not recommend paying anymore than that for it."
1,NOT SO GREAT,"This appears to be a very nice watch, however after a few days I noticed the outer rim (where the numbers appear) of the face moves. It appears to be loose.Right now the 12 is in the 7 position."
1,received damaged products twice,"the item that i received first time had cuts, corrotion, and even a finger print all over the surface. after replacing it, the second one is even worse, it had several deep cuts and a big dent damaging the thread, rendering it useless. priced twice as its similar product, i could not believe its quality control is so bad. i will not buy anything from marshall gas controls. wasting times and shipping cost. amazon is super always."
4,Night of too much fun,"Mr. Shannon shot out of the gate with this one, and if I hadn't already been familiar with his work, this one would have made me seek more out. I love the tone and feel of this book, and it truly is a wonderful homage to the books of that era and genre. Just know what you're going in for, and settle down and get it. Then move on to the next Shannon piece. You won't regret it."
5,Incredibly disturbing - but I loved it.,Unique characters that grab you from the beginning and take the reader on an adventure of the mind. A story full of disgusting death and sick inner thoughts. I could not put it down.There were times where my stomach felt ill after some of the bloody scenes.I highly recommend 'Night of the Beast.'
3,Entertaining solid first novel,"This is an interesting and well written book. I read the book in a week, which is fast for me. I thought the characters were very well developed and the story moved along at a quick pace.The atmosphere the author sets up through the novel is great. This is a no holds barred horror novel. I found it an unperdicatble fun read.If you are looking for new authors to try out I would recommend giving this book a try. It is Shannon's first novel and in my opinion shows alot of promise. I have already bought his second book and plan on starting that one soon.I am always trying to find new authors of horror fiction to read. the most recent ones I have tried were Bentley Little and Douglas Clegg. I found Shannon to be a far superiour story teller to these two writers.Check this one out."
2,This Beast Has No Bite!,"As others, I went on the hype this book generated and bought it. The beginning part was fun but unfortunately, half way through I had to give up. The plot thread jumped around to the point where you lost track of people and events. I found the characters to be un-sympathetic and the nostalgia generated to be maudlin and korny.Hopefully, my copy of Night of the Werewolf will be better."
3,Low-quality DVD,"I have to agree with Olga, not with Michael. As most VAI-issued DVDs of Russian operas, this is a copy of made-for-TV live recording (from 1983). From modern point of view, the quality of this DVD is unacceptable. The orchestra is bad, and the singers are good or acceptable, but not first-rate.If you want to refresh your happy memories of seeing the ""Tsar's Bride"" (not only one of the best Russian operas, but, on my mind, one of the best operas ""in general"") long time ago in Russia - this DVD may be a good solution (in particular, because you don't have another choice). However, if you want to discover this opera for yourself - you should listen to CD. Gergiev's recording is OK, but the best is Bolshoi's recording from the 70s with Vishnevskaya, Valaitis, Arkhipova, Nesterenko and Atlantov."
2,not worth buying for half the price,"This DVD will only sell because it is the only one available for ""Tsar's Bride,"" with the exception of the old Soviet black-and-white film. The singing is almost universally good, but the overall viewing experience is painful, as the production quality is so unprofessional. It's a live recording from the 1980s; the camera work is so shaky, it looks like a bootlegged back-of-the-movie-theater video done without a tripod. The sound engineering is worse: incorrectly placed microphones are picking up the voice of the prompter and distort the sound of the orchestra (which is not that great to begin with...). Stick to the CD recordings; this is not worth buying for half the price."
5,Irish exhuberance,"Four Men and A Dog is an Irish group with a high-energy approach that combines furious traditional dance tunes with relevant new music and inimitable covers. I mean, how can your resist an Irish fiddle version of ""I'm Walkin'""?Shifting Gravel is their second CD, and considering the attention it received when it was released, I'm surprised it's out of print. Check out the samples Amazon has and grab a copy if someone offers it!"
2,Rats! It has happened for a fourth time.,"This is the fourth time I have bought this product from different purveyors and each time the wide-screen version refuses to load. Guess I will have to watch it in full screen. For only $5 it isn't worth returning, again."
5,Great movie. Let the word out!,"Willard is a highly underrated film. Millions of people will go see the queen of garbage teen movies, yet I hear nothing about this movie that has all the classic ingredients of a horror movie. Of course there are some flaws, but nothing compared to recent horror movies I have seen lately. Crispin Glovers work however, was flawless.The thing that really caught my attention was the filming. The shots in the house are amazing. The camera work in general was amazing. The movie is also done in a very tasteful manner. Not much gore, and the one scene with the internet `porn' surprised me with it's tastefulness on just getting the gist of the idea by showing women in swimsuits instead of full nudity. (I don't know if it was changed from the theater version or not, either way, I found it very classy.)All around, it's a very good movie!"
3,There are rats in the cellar!,"I hear this movie didn't even make it 2 weeks in the theaters before it was yanked. The reason was the lack of interest, nobody went to see it. I guess the mainstream movie audience would rather see perky 'Legally Blonde' sequels or 'Matrix' rehashes.This movie wasn't given a chance. I never even heard about it until I saw it in the video store. I rented it. I loved it. I bought it. I like the dark themes and gothic settings. This film reminds me of ERASERHEAD in a gloomy comparison. Overacted in some scenes, but that is what gives it a campy feel.The best scene is when the cat is released in the house and tries to escape the rats. Talk about a morbid outcome.Watch it and be a little disturbed!"
2,NOT SCARY IN THE LEAST!,"Crispin undoubtedly makes the best of his role. Hence the 2 stars. BUT this movie is about as erie as a creeky floor bored during the day! It moves very slow and lacks alot in the way of unexpected scares. I simply do not understand why this DVD is more expensive than other new releases out there, especially since it didnt really have any exciting extra features. I for one wish I would have rented it instead of buying it."
2,Rats . . . And Interesting Psychological Thriller I Thought,"This movie was unique -- I thought of it as more of a psychological thriller. It caused the viewer to actually try to understand the cognitive mind of the main character Willard. It was interesting in that like most people Willard found solace in an animal that could not speak back. Despite his desire to befriend all of the rats he only favored one. Unfortunately, his favoritism of one particular rat nearly cost him his life as well as his sanity which was already ebbing away."
5,Best Movie Ever?,"To me, yes. I don't know why, but this movie really struck a nerve with me. I'm not the person AT ALL to see a movie and be like oh its the best ever, but I am now. I'm very very picky with movies and only a few deserve 5 stars in my book (Blade Runner, ROcky Horror Picture Show, Lord of the Rings). RHPS is my all-time fave, but it may just be ousted by Willard. I think Crispin Glover is marvelous in this movie. His facial expressions and emotional delivery is such that only he could deliver. I've never seen anybody so convincing in a role( that could be slightly disturbing) Anyway, if you are a complete animal lover, this may not be for you. I adore animals and spend every waking minute with them, and some scenes were really sad (Poor Kitty). But, nonetheless, I still adored this movie. It is my new obsession. Again, don't ask why. Just see it."
2,"Not Scary, but it is a good movie.","I know this is marketed as a scary movie, but it isn't scary at all. I would call it a drama/suspense movie. It is a very funny movie. I know other reviewers will tell you the entire thing so I'll just say see it for yourself."
2,Terrible film,"I have seen over 800 films in my day, and this by far was one of the worst. The movie was actually so bad that it prompted me to write my first negative review on Amazon. From the other reviews, you should have gotten a synopsis of the film. Now I didn't know that this film was a remake, it might have been a great movie during that era but for the generation that grew up on the likes of Fight Club, Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smokin Barrels, this take-it-to-the-man story just doesn't mean much. It's simply just creepy. I'd give it one star if the performance of Crispin Glover didn't make this film a bit less dull. Whatever metaphors, allegories or themes the film was suppose to invoke seemed to be completely overshadowed by the mere creepy factor that is this film. I bought this film (used) for one dollar, and it is so bad that I don't want to even keep it in my collection, I'm simply going to put it back where I got it."
2,Not what I expected.,"The only reason that I did not like this movie is because it is not what I expected. It was not a bad movie, it is just not the movie that the trailers made me believe it would be.Crispin Glover gives the performance of his lifetime. I guess the rats do as well.I won't get in to the whole story as others have already covered it very well.All I can say is, I thought it was going to be this horrific story of Crispin leading the rats to enact his vengeance on those who cross his path. That is correct in the one case where he has them attack his boss. But then the movie turns, almost instantly, to be a Crispin versus the rats movie. That is not what I wanted and what I wanted is not what I got.Also, from the trailers, I was led to believe that he hated his mother. That is not true either.I guess that is my only true gripe. It is not what you are led to believe it is."
4,For Pure Strangeness - This Is Tops,"I was attracted to this movie mainly because ""Creepy Thin Man"" (Crispin Glover) from Charlie's Angels takes the lead role. But also because the previews for the movie looked so disturbingly awesome. A man who controls swarms of rats. And that folks is the entire premise of the movie. There is perhaps one surprise in the movie that you may not see coming. But beyond that it's pretty well cut and dry. Willard is lonely. His dad has passed and his mom is on her last leg. He has no friends. No love interest. And his boss hates him. But guess what? Willard has the nifty ability to communicate with rats. Bet you didn't see that one coming (LOL!). Imagine what you would do if you had a mutual hate going with your boss and you could command rats in hideous numbers. . . oh yeah. I don't think I need to spell it out. And that's basically the main attraction here. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe called it "". . .wonderfully deranged."" - and that, I must say, holds true."
4,Worth a watch if you have pet rats. :D,"I had to get this only because I have pet rats. It was cute, a bit strange, but a good movie. I still want to see the original though!"
3,Dark and Deminted,"Willard is a pritty good movie that is made good by two things, descent story, and nice overall look. Of corse people who are scared of rats should stay a mile away from this film fror they will have a heart attack watching it (seriously). But for those of you who dont find rats sick and desgusting, watch willard its pritty good movie will good consept. At least watch it for Crispin Glovers acting, he is remarkable great in this film."
4,"It won't win any Oscars, but...","Pluses:1. Thoroughly enjoyable and creepy turn by star Crispen Glover2. Shirley Walker's brilliant score3. Interesting camera angles4. Socrates and Ben5. R.Lee Ermey's performance as swarthy ""Mr. Martin""7. ""Scully"" the cat8. Nice tribute to Bruce Davison, the star of the original9. A wonderfully-stage opening credit montage, featuring various types of animationMinuses:1. Not enough big scares2. The speed with which Willard is able to ""train"" his rat horde3. Too similar to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", something that can't quite be said about the first oneThus, the pluses outweigh the minuses making ""Willard"" a film worth of one's time and, perhaps, one's bucks."
3,THE ORIGINAL FILM IS BETTER BUT....................,"What a shame! The producers missed a golden opportunity to take a movie that is remembered fondly,but certainly had room for improvement! Crispin Glover was a perfect choice to play Willard Stiles and he does a great job. Unfortunately, Bruce Davidson's performance is even better in the original along with Ernest Borgnine's Mr. Martin topping R.Lee Ermey's interpretation of that character. These two performances are why I still hold the original a little higher than the remake. The rats and effects are better(in most cases)in the new film,but they lost something along the way? F.Y.I. That's Elsa Lanchester as Willards mother in the original A.K.A The Bride Of Frankenstein!"
3,Average retelling,"Friday, August 13, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Average retelling.First off I've always enjoyed Crispin Glover in his wacky roles, and Willard is one that he sinks his teeth into with relish. That said, I think this movie still pales on some levels when compared to its original with Bruce Davidson as the title character. The picked on boy who befriends a white rat and eventually trains an army of rats to do his bidding seemed much more serious and less self aware in the original. When Davidson confronted and poked / prodded Borgnine over the death of Socrates, that was chilling; as when Willard eventually met his demise with Ben looking on, a much more powerful ending than this version. Sadly big budget CG effects and gloss doesn't improve necessarily upon the original. Still, a mildly amusing outing."
4,Willard (2003),"Dark, menacing remake of the 1971 original classic delivers the goods all around, and even pokes humour at itself a couple times. Crispin Glover plays a shy, mysterious man who lives with his ill mother who soon makes friends with rats in his basement in which he chooses a white mouse to be the leader. Soon, a giant rat who he names Big Ben, becomes jealous of the leader and wreaks havoc upon Willard. Glover is superb as the psychotic Willard, and although you don't feel as much sympathy for him as one would expect, you do feel for him during his hard times. An entertaining film that is most definitely not a waste of two hours! Recommended."
2,Whaaaaaat????????,"Ok, the only good thing about this movie, if you can call it GOOD, is Crispin Glover's performance. Other than that, this is a boring movie!! Too slow paced and silly at times. I was disappointed in this movie. The rats didn't bother me at all, what bothered me was the fact that this movie was such a letdown. If you intend to see this film, prepared to be bored."
5,Meet the best character in the story...,"If your already into Fushigi Yugi, then you will love the tape. This is the second coolest next to the 8th one. They just get better as they reach the end. Tasueka rules. You'll see. Last story is to sad though."
5,Don't be fooled!!! You can get all the series for 20 bucks!,Don't buy Fushigi Yuugi from here! There are fan subs that are distributed for free and or charge only postage-handeling and price of the casset! You can get more for your money! look up Fushigi Yuugi fan subs on the internet!!!
4,Dealing with teachers who are angry trhoubled and confused,Great book for not only teachers but those who provide service to them..
4,Not the best 2d fighter,"The Dreamcast certainly has better fighting games than this, but that doesn't mean this game isn't good.If you have played all the King of Fighters games and Fatal Fury to death, this game is a good change of pace. It is a little bit slower and methodical than most 2d fighters. The super moves are not complex at all, but picking when to do them is the challenge, not ""how"" to do them.The only real gripe I have about this fighter would be how people either love it or hate it. I can never find someone who would rather play this with me than any of the other Dreamcast fighting games.If you are looking for a change of pace from other SNK games or just want to see some new characters with different moves to learn, pick this up it won't dissappoint."
2,Hold your horses fighting fans,"I am a big fan of fighting games, so when I saw last blade 2 for the sega dreamcast at a fair price I decided to give it a go. I was a big fan of other games of SNK's such as samurai showdown, but when I put this game in my system the first thing that I noticed was dated graphics. I wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me so I ventured on. The next thing I noticed was that it is pretty much basic fighting. There were no fire balls or hurricane kicks, just slicing with knifes and simplistic button mashing. In conclusion if some of you amatuer fighting game fans are looking for something to play an expirenced person at then this might give you the upper hand. But if you are a fan of the high flying moves then maybe this is a rental game."
1,Awful game,"If this game were for the original Nintendo it might be decent but even then it would be hard pressed to find an excuse for why it plays so badly.I like 2D fighters. I still think Street Fighter 2 is one of the best games ever made. Samurai Showdown is another classic example of a great 2D fighter. It was this game that made me decide to pick Last Blade 2 up. If you also loved Samurai Showdown and are considering picking this game up, don't! This game is just awful.From the lackluster graphics (even for a 2D game) to the four frames of animation per sprite (character) this game is just a poor example of what fighting games should be. If you want a 2D fighter stick to the Capcom games and you should be fine. If you just want a great fighting game, Dreamcast has one of the best in Soul Calibur. If you're into samurai, get Bleemcast (or a PSOne or PS2) and get Bushido Blade 2, but by all means, ignore this piece of junk."
2,not recommended for gundam fans!!!,"a gundam fan myself, i bought this boxed set out of impluse seeing that it has the complete collection in three discs, for $39...too good of a deal. i did a little more research & found out that this collection compressed all 10 discs into a movie format. many of the important scences are missing & too much will be happening. i canceled my order & will wait for the price to drop on the economy box set with all 5 discs per season"
2,Disappointed Fan,"I too bought this Set for the ""Amazing price"" that it sells for. Only to be hurt whenever I watched the DVD's and almost 3/4 of the scenes in the movie were taken out!!! So not funny, Only bonus to this set is that it comes with a CD of the Seed music from the movie, Which in fact is not bad if your into music you cant really understand. If I would have known any better then to buy this because of the bargin buy it was, I would have just bought each Episode DVD over time."
5,An enticing collection of stories for the dark fantasy lover,"One of my most cherished books, ""The Gorgon"" was my first taste of Tanith Lee's talent. She has a real gift for capturing the atmosphere of the fairy tale in an entirely original way. If you can find this book, buy it!"
4,Great fun,"This was a great choice for our recent travel by plane for our 2 1/2 yr old twin boys. It kept them busy for quite some time and they loved all the different choices of Thomas characters to play with. The only drawbacks were that it was pretty heavy and too big to fit in their travel backpacks, so Mom got to lug them around. Other than that, the pieces can tear apart relatively easily, with the paper front pulling away from the magnetic backing... not a very durable toy, but fun nonetheless. Also, shipping was super fast - two days!"
4,Conversation Starter,"These billiard balls are a definate eye catcher. They are different in a good way and will be noticed if you have guests over for a friendly game. If they have a drawback, players used to the standard color billiard balls may have a problem identifying which ball they are currently playing. This is a small issue that can be overcome after you become familiar with the differences. It was worth the money just for the conversation value."
1,Not a bad price for toilet paper,"at 2.29 per book it's cheaper than toilet paper. Of course, it's not nearly as good of a read. Marsiglio is a joke and should give it up now."
3,Some issues with this book,I bought this book because the nun that teaches religious classes highly recommended it when I was asking alot of questions. I can't say I thought it was that great and it gave answers that I really didn't feel were quite comfortable with. But if a nun believes in it I could sure be wrong.
5,Amen,"If you are looking for a hopeful, faith-filled perspective of the Catholic Christian Church then Thomas Groome's What Makes Us Catholic?: Eight Gifts for Life is for you. Groome's book is a fluent, thoughtful examination of what today's Catholic Church is called to be. It reminds us that each Catholic is an integral part of the Church (body of Christ)."
2,What does the author mean by Christian?,"If you're a 'Catholic' you will probably love this book. But if you're a 'Christian' you may debate some issues. Even though the author uses the words Catholic and Christian synonymously he is promoting Catholicism as the true religion. However, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Baptists, Lutherans, and a whole host of other denominations also call themselves Christians. Then I must ask myself, ""What's the difference between a 'Catholic' Christian and a 'Pentecostal' Christian?"" Obviously both consider themselves Christian, yet if you look at the two religions they have very little in common. I read the gospels and I couldn't find where Jesus made distinctions between those who followed Him, He preached only one consistent gospel."
3,Decent but not gung-ho enough for me,"I can really mess up my feet by going barefoot in the summer. So I scrub them down and put lotion on them and add cotton socks and hope for the best. Some products deliver and my feet are nice and soft again within a couple of days. This product, however, is too gentle and that means wearing socks to bed more often in the summer. Yuck. However, it smells nice.Not only is it slow, it is too expensive - you can get a nice foot cream from Avon for a tenth the priceFoot Works By Avon Therapeutic Cracked Heel Relief Cream. Or you can use VaselineVaseline Skin Protectant, Original 13 oz (368 g), which is a miracle drug, right up there with Aspirin. Vaseline will fix my feet in two nights while Dr. Scholl's takes a week."
3,Dr. Scholl's Pedicure Essentials Ultra Overnight Foot Cream ...,"Dr. Scholl's Pedicure Essentials Ultra Overnight Foot Cream has a very pleasant aroma -- a very light and clean scent. The lotion is not greasy, but it does not absorb completely. It leaves a moist feeling. I haven't found it to completely relieve my dry skin as yet. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has very dry skin, However if you have light to moderately dry skin, then I'd recommend it. The best feature of this product is the scent."
4,Colonial Cousins,"It is a fantastic voyage...on one side the rythyms and textures blend so well together it makes the melodies shine so bright. On the other side, it slows down and harmonies are explored fully, naturally, and beautifully. I like it very much. I want to get their next album!"
5,A Great Read and a Great Gift,"This is a wonderful book that is easy to read, and you can tell it is written from the heart. I am strong in my Christian faith, and yet this book gave me more information on how to respond to skeptics and the lazy and how to better spread the word to friends and family. I recommend this book to anyone who may need that extra push to become a committed Christian again in his or her life or for the first time. I also recommend this book as a gift for family and close friends. This is a book that I will be giving to many young adults who are headed off to college. 5 stars!"
2,Irony defined,"I'm not quite sure what to make of this author, who spews hatred of gays, minorities, democrats etc...on a daily basis from the hate radio station he owns, commenting on the teachings of the Bible.For someone who spends all his waking hours spewing hatred and divisiveness to write a book of this nature, boggles the mind. Your money is better spent reading works from someone who actually understands the teachings of the bible."
2,Nothing new,This bold and arrogant title should turn off any thinking person. Without a talk show to push this book to the non-thinking it would die in a publishers reject pile. I was hoping for some creativity but this book is a cliche which you can get from any biblical extremist. Give your money to your favorite charity rather than waste it on this.
1,Save your time,"Yet another in an apparently unending series of health and wealth tomes. Patrick's view of Christianity is naive and unrealistic. I can just imagine Jesus calling Patrick and saying, ""Do me a favor and quit using my name for your own personal aggrandizement."""
1,Just another author who believes in myths,"If you believe in the Bible myths you may enjoy this book. If you recognize the Bible for what it is, the myths, lies and inflated stories of some illiterate bronze age nomads, this book is just a complete waste of time."
2,only one dvd?,For something that spanned so many years to sum it up in 90 minutes is just rediculous. There wasn't enough commentary by enough wrestlers and there wasn't enough clips of good moments from both sides.
5,Must Have DVD,"I just bought this dvd today along with the new ""Stone Cold Truth."" Both are AWESOME two of the best WWE dvd's in a long time. So hurry and buy RIGHT NOW you'll not regret it."
2,Almost complete B.S.,Almost complete revisionist B.S. perpetrated by Vince Mcmahon. If you're dumb enough to believe a lot of what's said on this DVD set- you deserve to own it.
2,"""A BIG LETDOWN""","THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A 2-HOUR DOUBLE DISC DVD WITH ALOT MORE INSIGHT AND DEPTH AND ALOT MORE MATCHES LIKE WHEN: LUGER BEAT HOGAN ON NITRO FOR THE TITLE IN 1997,MICK FOLEY'S TITLE WIN ALONG WITH THE CONTRAVERSIAL ""POKE OF DOOM"" MATCH WITH HOGAN AND NASH;BOTH I MIGHT ADD WERE AIRED ON THE SAME NIGHT.THERE IS ALOT OF STUFF AND FACTIODS MISSING ON THIS ONE FOLKS."
1,This garbage is actually getting 5 stars?.,Vince McMahon crying that Bisheoff tryed to put the then WWF out of business is pure comedy gold after the way McMahon ran all the competition under in the 80's.Funny things is Paul Heyman just loves to whine about WCW talent raiding ECW (Tommy Dreamer in a classic once compared WCW to the Taliban) yet not a word is mumbled from him when the WWE did the same thing and of course no one mentions how McMahon raided almost every major player in American Pro Wrestling in the 80's.Anyone giving this trash 5 stars is either a die hard WWE fan or never watched wrestling during the war.I watched both companys and both were under handed and just plain retarded at times but both also put on some amazing TV and sadly we may never see a glorious time like that in wrestling again.
3,own it and.....,it wuz ok... should have more d-generation x matches and nwo in speciasl fetures.*sigh* those were the good old dayz=(
5,This is a must have!,"As I'm watching this dvd while writing this review, i found intrigue with not only the interviews with those who were there, but also contains some unseen footages behind the scenes, as well as memorable performances and matches in that piece of history (such as the late Owen Hart and Road Warrior Hawk). Also, please pay special attention to one particular commentary by Jim Cornette, in which i just couldn't stop laughing as i listened to it). Bottom line, it's a can't miss item INDEED!"
4,The War is Over but the Battle Lives On (WWE vs TNA)!,"The only reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good, I wished there was an additional DVD on it that featured more classic matches from Raw and Nitro and more additional interviews. I was a little upset when they censored Ravishing Rick Rude taking cheap shots at the WWE in the Extra's menu because he said more than they shown on the DVD. They also censored X-Pac's interview when he's taking cheap shots at Hogan and Bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the WWE from WCW. I did think Eric Bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small (but major) details as well as Vince holding back some info. Overall, a nice WWE DVD to add to your collection. I just wish they added more matches and interviews. TNA better watch themselves."
4,"Great Dvd,not so great matches",I loved the dvd but the matches weren't that great. I am sure there were other matches they could have put on the dvd. They were pretty boring. The other extras were good in my opinion though. WWE may sound like they are talking down to WCW but if you listened closely who ever won the war would have braggin rights and guess who won. WWE!!! So that was not an issue to me. The Jim Cornette commentary in the extras section was a pretty powerful promo. I still love it to this day. I wish they would have show all of them. So if you are going to get this dvd don't because of the bonus matches. Do it for the knowledge of what happened behind the scenes. Nice extras though excluding the matches. This is of course my opinion you might enjoy them. I am a fan of almost 20 years and I didn't like them.
3,The Monday Night Lies,"The Monday Night War is a pretty good documentary between the war. People who get talk on here is Eric Bischoff, Vince Mcmahon, Jim Ross, Eddie Guerrero, Gerald Brisco, Mick Foley, Chris Benoit, Big Show, Chris JerichoRey Mysterio, Jim Cornette, Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, gene okerlund. They show some clips before the monday night war started. It talks about when first Raw started and Eric Bischoff talks about how he became executive producer and started nitro. It has a lot to talk about the formation of the NWO, well anyways I would like to explain more. In my opinion, I would rather read information on the internet, cause this dvd is basically a one-minded story. The WWF makes it to sound like WCW is nothing but pure evil"
1,Lousy,"Vince McMahon couldn't boil an egg, let alone produce a decent documentary. A waste of time and money. Save your money and buy any ECW DVD instead. They're still out there if you look hard enough, and they make WWE look sick."
3,Monday Night War,"This is a good highlight DVD for the Monday Night War.However, like the previous reviewer, I agree that the matches should not have been cut like they were. If you want a GREAT supplement to this video, order the nWo video, that is a classic one and will give even more detailed history of the Monday Night War. The only part of this video that I did not really like was Jim Ross' mouth being attached to Vince MacMahon's [behind] the entire time he is giving information. If you can cut Ross' comments, this would give this a four star review. But it does lose two stars for those commments and the fact that it seems like it was RUSHED into production, perhaps why they cut out intros and reactions in the 'complete matches' of the EXTRAS.Overall, a good documentary."
3,A little too self-congratulatory...,"Yes I know this is a WWE product and therefore things will be a bit biased on their side, but cmon guys... Pretty much they gloss over the 84 weeks that WCW was beating the WWF in the ratings and instead focus on the rising star of Steve Austin. Yes he was instrumental in helping the WWF during that time but to shift the focus away from what was really happening is pretty lame.Interestingly enough, of all the promos and clips they show...one thing they do NOT show are the promos that say the WWF has gone to the US government to look into why WCW was running their show on the same night as RAW and making wrestling fans choose a side to be on. I remember seeing those promos and thinking...Vince...you are whining like a baby.I'd give this a cautious thumbs up, but keep in mind that things are pretty biased here.T"
2,Could have been great.,Not many matches at all... it would have been great if they would have shown some key matches that took place during the war in chronological order rather than going the documentary route. Its not a complete dissapointment but I would deffinately get it used.
3,Average Monday Night,"When I heard about this DVD, I thought what the hell, I'll give this a chance. After all, I remember watching most if not all of the moments they talked about. And I thought this would be a great way to relive the best era in pro wrestling, sports entertainment, whatever you want to call it. I think it was okay and shed some new things I didn't know (for instance, I didn't know McMahon once owned the old, old WCW before selling it to Turner many, many years ago and Rude being on Nitro and Raw the same night) but it really seemed like an extended Confidential. The extras are okay, but obviously there are could have been more (perhaps the last Nitro match with Sting and Flair, Shane showing up on Nitro, etc.)It's average at best."
3,Not As Good As I Expected,I was disappointed. The dvd was so hyped that it wasn't as good as they said it was. The first half of it was good but when it came to the second half it just sucked. The second half was pretty much Vince and his stooge Brisco say that WCW sucked and the WWF is 1000 times better and thats why they died. The extras aren't that great either they could have been much better. If you buy this don't have high expectations like I did. Personally I thought that the NWO DVD was better.
2,not so good.,"it is very strong. if you like mono stick with it. no give, tangles are impossible to sort and buries on your spool."
1,Major disappointment,"I put this line on a high-end fresh-water spinning reel, and after several months, used it for the first time. I lost two lures because the line broke while casting, and after the second cast the reel had the worst backlash I have ever experienced. And that was on a spinning reel!"
1,Try something else,"I was very disappointed in this product. For years I've been contemplating using this type of line, and was looking forward to casting out and not seeing twirly string floating on the water. I loaded my Zebco 33 with 10 pound test and went out for cats. On the first cast, I went out about 10 feet before it snagged in the reel. I spent several minutes casting, pulling several armlengths of string out of my reel, reeling up and repeating until I could cast about 40 yards without hanging up. After a successful cast, I let my bait sink to the bottom and caught a catfish about 5 minutes later. Fish landed and bagged, I went to cast out again. This time, the line went out about 4 feet before it snagged. I repeated the process twice before I gave up and packed that rod and reel away. The first chance I get, that reel will be restrung with monofilament and all my Spiderwire Stealth is going straight in the trash!"
5,Very pretty,"After I ordered it, I noticed that the description said it was 35 millimeters in length and thought I had bought a monstrosity! But it is probably 12 millimeters and is very pretty pink jade."
2,Shows resentment and poor behavior,"While the resentment the Big Sister shows in this book may be typical, it is not the behavior I am trying to encourage in my daughter soon to be a big sister. I will be returning this book."
2,A disjointed film.,"This uncharacteristically haphazard production virtually ignores the earliest days of pro football, spends too much precious time recounting the history of the rival AFL (which deserves a separate film of its own), and doggedly refuses to follow any kind of chronological order. While baseball gets the Ken Burns treatment, with a proper multi-volume approach, NFL fans are stuck with this. NFL Films generally does good work, but not here."
4,A good unit but a bit pricey,I have had this unit in service for over 2 years as a remote monitoring camera at my vacation home. The unit works very well and delivers better than average video quality for a web cam. I have not had any operational issues with the unit. I am using the wireless to connect to my router. Cons are that only WEP seems to work and the range of pan/tilt is limited. I wish it was compatible with browsers other that IE as I use Firefox for the rest of my cameras without issue. It is a bit pricey but given I have had no operational issues it is worth the extra $$.
2,Cisco WVC200 Wireless Internet Camera,"This is an older model of the product. Many improvements have been made to the newest model WVC210. If money is an issue go with the WVC200 the improvements are not that significant. Both models have an email notification which is NON functional. When Cicso support was contacted, their help was non existant on the problem. Their solution was, ""it is your ISP problem,"" with NO troubleshooting effort on their part whatsoever. This is uncommon for Cicso, MOST of their support is acceptable. Must be all these cost cutting efforts that we end users get to suffer with. These cameras are classified as Small Business equipment as opposed to Consumer end users. If you purchase one of these cameras, make sure you are buying the model you want."
3,It's OK,"The camera was pretty easy to set up and get working on my network. It does make it easy to pull the feed directly from the camera rather than rely on a browser to view. I also set RTSP up and can view the feed via my cell phone. All that is great. The downsides are that I was only getting about 10fps at 320x240, at best. Tight now, it is down to about 3fps and I need to investigate. The PTZ is extremely noisy. It is somewhat cheaply made for a $250 camera. The wireless range is pathetic. It is directly under my Linksys WRT54G router, one floor down, and I had to tweak the position and antennas to get signal. I think this is common with anything Linksys. I have a Linksys WVC54GCA which I cannot even use in my living room unless I wire it. I also have to power cycle it about every 2 weeks, or it gets buggy.I have no opinion on the included software, since it has yet to be opened.Overall, I like it better than the WVC54GCA, but I should, at 2 1/2 times the price."
3,Setup difficult,I bought a couple of these cameras to set up a home system and setup is a pain. Although overall nice cameras very buggy.I use a Linksys WRT600N router with TKIP and was able to set up one camera wireless with no problem. The other 2 to no avail.In the end the problem boiled down to shorten the security key to 8 spaces which was no problem with the first camera... Strange.If you like to tinker this is for you.MS
4,Works great...not so great to set up,"Cam is good, however hope this helps with others setting this up;1 - Could only get it to work on WEP2 - Once you set up the port, you can access it external using you IP address and adding :1024 (or whatever the port number is)3 - Use a fixed IP address"
1,Less than expected picture quality,"I returned this unit after several days of fiddling. I got it to work on my wireless network, no problem. The monitor software was easy to use and could be expanded with more cameras. Unfortunately, the picture quality was never very good. I boosted the settings to maximum and still felt the quality was not what it should be. I just couldn't keep it with such a high price and the low picture quality. I suggest you select a different camera."
2,WVC200 Camera review,"The motion detection doesn't work well at all.Other than that, it isn't a bad wireless camera.The audio isn't very good either and you can not take pictures of someone sitting next to a lamp."
4,Have not been able to go wireless!,Cam has good resolution and color is adequate. Plastic stand is pretty cheesy. Not obvious how or what sequence is required to make it operate wirelessly but works well on LAN cable.
1,"Avoid this Camera, Buy Panasonic !!!","I purchased this camera and sent it back 48-hours later. I have a Linksys WRT350N (top of the line wireless-N router). This camera would not join the network. I am network savvy, still no joy in a wireless setup. Plus, in wired mode I had a chance to review the functionality of the camera, and let me tell you, it stinks. Sure, resolution `is-what-it-is', but the pan and tilt motor sounds like a freight train. Obviously, this camera wasn't intended for clandestine operation, nor was this what I was looking for, however I didn't intend to wake the dead every time the pan/tilt motor engages. I sent this product back and ordered the Panasonic BL-C131; Panasonic makes a great camera!"
3,Wirless No Work,I had lots of issues with installation and configuration. Had to download new firmware for an out of the box purchase. Many calls to Linksys. They were helpful but the wireless functionality has never worked.
3,Firmware upgrade needed,"I would say that this product is not as easy as advertised. In order for me to see any picture at all I had to upgrade the firmware of the camera. Also the software interface so slow, cumbersome and not so user friendly."
2,Don't bother!,"The color of the image is WAY off (greens and blues display as red) and there is no way to adjust them. Don't expect to display the output on a web page without giving the caller your user name and password and then just PRAY they don't modify your setup! The image itself shows a ""fish-eye"" effect. Linksys has not addressed these issues in spite of the many complaints on their support forum. Nor will they provide any documentation on how to program the camera for a web site. My $50 Logitech web cam does a far better job."
4,"Good camera, bad setup instructions","For the money the camera is OK, but setup is a nightmare. Needs better instructions...."
3,Linksys Wireless-G PTZ WVC200,"It presents/displays many problems for its configuration, for example so that messengers of yahoo works like camara Web in hotmailSince I can make to use Linksys Wireless-G PTZ Internet Camera with Audio WVC200 - Network camera - pan / tilt - color ( Day&Night; ) - audio - 10/100, 802.11b, 802.11g - DC 5 V, like webcam in messengers of yahoo and hotmail"
2,Internet Cams,I have not tried this camera but I have a Wireless Panasonic Internet Cam. It is great. It's a little expensive but well worth it. You can monitor your home from anywhere you get internet access. You can have one or more cam views with additional cameras. I am getting ready to purchase a couple more.Cons: No sound.
1,Very difficult to set up.,Very dissapointed with the service i recieved for highly trained tech's for my linksys wv200 internet camera.I would rate myself as highly knowledgeable person in regards to setting up networks and ip or software issues. Spent countless hours of talks with the tech support of troubleshoot........still ended up dissapointed.Didnt expect such low quality of service for such a big copration.Have lost a customer and word of mouth from me about this product and services.In conclusion i had to return the camera.
2,still can not get to operate on internet,"a virtual nightmare with set up. no help from their support staff on phones, nor online Q&A.; poorest choice i ever have made in a product!!I am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books. Item still sitting where i left it......., useless."
3,Too dim. Maybe the 100 watt bulbs are better?,"I got a pack, and none have blown. They may indeed be longlasting. However, the 60 watt is considerably dimmer than a regulat 60 watt bulb. For me, it is UNUSABLE anyplace I use a light for reading. These are being relegated to the garage, hallways, etc. I will try again with their 100 watt bulbs and keep my fingers crossed. But don't make the same mistake that I did."
4,Good Light Bulbs,"I built a custom home 3 years ago, and wondered why most of the light bulbs that the electrician installed lasted so long, while I had to replace ones I had put in after only a few months. After some investigation, I discovered that light bulbs are built to last for ""x"" hours. Most of the ones you buy in the store are made to last a few months, so you have to keep replacing them. Electricity surges will also shorten the life of a bulb.The ""lifetime bulbs"" are very long lasting light bulbs. They are rated to last 20,000 hours and most of the ones I have purchased in the past have done that, or exceeded that. I have had a few in certain sockets that don't last as long, but this seems to be related to the socket, and not the bulb.I have not tested the company to see if they would replace a bulb as they guarantee, because I am so happy that 90% of the ones that I bought have worked as advertised. I have had some in use for 2 1/2 years without failure.I highly reccomend these bulbs."
3,Inspired Conducting Ruined by Over the Top Soloists,"I am a devotee of George Szell, but I can barely tolerate this recording. It is ironic indeed that the many critics of Szell find much to like here.Szell made this recording in 1968. By then Elizabeth Schwarzkoph was well past her prime (I admit I prefer young voices). She compensated for vocal decline by turning arch and coy, and she was never worse than in this recording. Fischer Dieskau was also best when young. Then he paid attention to the vocal line. But soon he began to overemphasize each of the words.Why Szell put up with this misbehavior I do not know. His conducting is superb, but one misses the Cleveland Orchestra.My favorite recording of this work is the relatively unknown version conducted by Felix Prohaska, with Maureen Forrester and Heinz Rehfuss."
4,"Sounds good, but first two tracks defective",I liked these but the first two tracks sounded as if they had been ripped from a scratched CD so I bought the Quastoff/van Otter recording
4,A classic recording,"This recording was known to set the standard for these songs ever since it came out. However, I heard the Abbado version before this one, which won a Grammy. Both sets are complimentary as the Abbado uses one voice per song where here you can hear the soloists interact. Both female soloists overdo the humour at first, sounding mannered and effortful but they quickly settle in and provide eloquent readings. Von Otter has the better voice, but Schwarzkopf varies her voice much more. Fischer Dieskau is more daring then Quasthoff, attempting a more aggressive tone in the military songs. This disc is more stingy though; no Urlicht is included. Overall the Szell is more rough and earthy whereas Abbado is more refined. Take your pick but why not get them both?"
3,Studying Gay Men of Color,"Too often, biased people want to insist that all the gays are white and all the people of color are straight. Too often, any study of gays focuses on New York City and San Francisco, but nowhere else. Too often, ""people of color"" focuses on Blacks only, or Blacks and Latinos only. This study is a nice retreat from those problems. It is a multi-city study. It speaks of Blacks, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans.I'm glad it exists, but it is just a dry policy study. The book has no photos and is just a power point lecture put in text form.Too many, this also feels terribly dated. While the study strongly emphasizes that many men who kick it with men don't identify as gay or bisexual, it never uses the new term ""the down low."" Further, I think this study was printed before more effective AIDS drugs called HAART therapy were produced. Luckily, I think this study has an awesome update in the studies compiled in the book by Sana Loue."
2,Fence Style Falls Short,"This book tried to be two different things and, as a result, accomplished neither. On the one hand, it appears that the authors wanted to publish a book of arty fence photographs (and indeed the book includes a number of lush, imaginative shots), while at the same time offering a how-to guide for fence building. Unfortunately, the how-to portion keeps the book from being a bona fide artistic endeavor, while the space and presentation given to artsy fence portraits prevents the book from ever developing into a sufficiently comprehensive building guide. Bottom line: don't expect this book to deliver an adequate lesson in actual fence-building techniques, if you don't have building skills to begin with; but if you just want to look at pictures of a bunch of other people's fences, you probably won't be too disappointed."
4,Be careful not to tear the magnet cutouts.,I bought this for a road trip and my 3 year old son enjoyed it. The only problem I had was that I easily tore one of the magnetic truck cut outs in half when I was removing them from the sheet. They are pretty thin.
3,Too expensive for what you get,"This sounded like fun, but there are too few magnets, and the price by the time you include shipping and handling makes it not worth it."
3,"Great album, but this US version is sadly lacking.","The DVD portion of this disc contains video footage as well as a Dolby Digital 24/48 5.1 surround mix and a superior dts 24/96 5.1 surround mix.The CD contains the regular version of the album.I have the UK version which I imported from Amazon.co.uk's marketplace sellers, I believe ""Caiman"" was the seller I used. If you have a 20, 60 or 80GB PlayStation 3 or a Super Audio CD player (SACD) then do yourself a favour and get the UK version.The difference between the SACD version of the Album and any of the versions presented on this US one is night and day. It's tragic that they have screwed up all the US versions of the DM reissues.Go for the fidelity - your ears will love you for it."
5,Depeche Mode - Violator,I absolutely LOVE it! His voice and the music couldn't be more perfect. I had only heard Personal Jesus on the radio recently before buying this. I hate I've missed out ( I'm 54). You won't be disappointed.
5,Brilliant!,"This is an amazing 5.1 surround sound mix. None of that live DVD bulls*** where they just put the song in the front 3.1 speakers and the sound of the audience in the back speakers or other ""surround sound"" mixes that just push the music to all 5.1 speakers without any actual mixing. Highly recommended."
4,"Not the greatest, but still great","This is a great DM album. I admit, I do like it pretty much, I like Martin's lyrics a lot and the music is quite good. I liked about more than half of the tracks (seven or eight of them) and I thought the music for both ""Blue Dress"" and ""Personal Jesus"" are great. However, I am not giving this album a perfect five as I thought some of the music sounded a tiny bit the same such as ""World in My Eyes"" and ""Halo"" may give some people a feeling that they resemble. Overall, this is a great album and Depeche Mode has definitely done a great job on the mixing of styles."
4,Feeling Violated...,"""Violator"" is probably the first Depeche Mode album that would generally appeal to a wide array of listeners. While DM's previous offerings were showing steady improvement, it wasn't until this record that the band seemed to strike a chord between their electronically-dominated sound and melodies that hooked and reeled you in. Violator is full of catchy lyrics and contains arguably Depeche Mode's most mainstream hits, however it was still a natural progression from 1987's ""Music For The Masses."" This was the first CD I ever owned, and I still hold it in high regard...""Violator"" is very solid from start to finish."
3,"good, but ...","This was my first DM cd, and now, 8-9 years later, my least favorite.Like another reviewer said. It's 'perfect' maybe too perfect. Imperfection makes for interesting listening."
2,Not as good as people say!,"The album might be catchy, but it's not too in depth, lyrically and musically. A must have for understanding how DM made it in the US. People seem to pick up on the lowest material from a band and make it sound fantastic."
2,Mediocre at best,"Surprisingly, since I am such a big fan of Electro-Industrial and various kinds of 80s wave, I really don't find this album to have much worth listening to. At least for me, DM has a horrible sense of chords and notes to create an emotional response, as all they do is make me bored."
5,One of the best CD's out there,"I highly recommend this CD to anyone, from people only partially interested in DM, or to fans! This is one CD where you won't have to skip over any tracks, because each and every one of these songs is awesome!""Enjoy The Silence"" is probably my favorite song EVER. ""Personal Jesus"" also ranks high.Get this CD right away!"
1,THIS IS NOT THE SACD/CD + DVD EDITION,"Please pay attention,this is the standard edition of ""Violator""I buyed thinking it was the deluxe edition with hybrid SACD/CDIn this version the 5.1 surround track is available only on DVD"
5,Worth Buying...if only for the DVD,"Technology is moving forward and who wouldn't love to have their favorite albums remastered? This is genius! I hope they plan to have each of their albums redone in this manner. The true prize is the DVD. If you appreciate viewing intimate interviews with the songwriter, producers, musicans, and other key players as well as an insight into each track and how they came about, this is a must have. Best of all, the DVD features current interviews of Alan Wilder and for those who appreciate his past contribution to Depeche's music, it is certainly a treat to see him again. I did heed the advice of others who suggested purchasing the import. A great addition for collectors and fans of Depeche Mode."
4,A classic Depeche Mode album,"Many songs that you would hear from Depeche Mode in dance clubs come from this album. ""Personal Jesus"" is a track I'm particularly fond of. ""World in my Eyes"" and ""Policy of Truth"". There is hardly a bad track on this album. Combine it with ""Music for the Masses"" and ""Black Celebration"", and you have Depeche Mode's best and most modern sounding work."
1,Buy the import version instead,"For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame. If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticably better (especially on ""Speak & Spell""). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."
5,80s but a goodie! Awesome beat!,"I've always loved Depeche Mode and I still do. I thought that I'd get tired of listening to them...I thought wrong. I got this as a birthday gift and too bad that ""Strangelove"" is not in this cd. Well, I guess I'll have to buy a cd with that song. ""World in My Eyes"" is intriguing, enigmatic, and explosive. Love the ""Policy of Truth""...love his deep voice...how can you deny Depeche Mode? Lovelovelove! Thank you Depeche Mode for creating awesome music."
3,Torn On This One,"Great album, fantastic music and very much their Pet Sounds. I loved it when I was a senior in High School and love it today. I was really looking forward to this one a lot becuase DM was made for surround sound. And it delivers on most, less on others, but, some stuff is missing from the songs that are on the original release. I know most say to buy the overseas SACD version, I got the US one. Over all, it is what it is and still play it. Added to the collection of SACD/DVD Audio, what the hell for the price. If you are a die hard fan, get the SACD version."
5,Violator-A True Classic,What a great album! After 10 years it still sounds fresh and vibrant and most importantly vital. A must have for any electronic/techno/alternative fan.
5,Brilliant...Fantastic...Excellent.,"Song for song, this is the best album Depeche Mode has put out. Everything associated with Violator is excellent. The singles and non-album tracks are so uniform, but yet have their own distinctiveness. From ""World In My Eyes"" until the last second of ""Clean"", the album takes you on a trip and leaves you wanting more. In that respect, I feel that ""Halo"" should have been released and that would have secured the album with a fifth consecutive single that would have brought the house down. Overall this is one album every fan should own in their collection"
4,Depeche Mode's most accessible album,"The most consistent non-compilation album in Depeche Mode's discography, Violator contains a little bit of everything. There are some perfect synth pop songs (""Enjoy the Silence,"" ""Policy of Truth""), a couple of beautiful and relaxing Gore penned ballads (""Waiting for the Night,"" ""Blue Dress""), and even a bluesy (albeit, with a very simple riff) rock and roll number (""Personal Jesus""). And with its melodic, climactic chorus, ""Halo"" could easily have been the album's fifth single. There really isn't one worthless song in the bunch, although the hypocritical sounding redemptive message in ""Clean"" (considering the lyrical content of the cohabitating ""World in My Eyes"" and ""Policy of Truth""), makes it come close."
5,That album is THE BEST !!!,"I am a great fan of DM (and various other synthie, gothic and wave bands) and Violator is definietly their best album ... a bit different from the earlier albums but still rocgnisable as a DM part of work after listening to any song for a few seconds. I love the way they introduced some guitar (and yes, go to a DM concert and watch the crowd when they play Personal Jesus ... boy, that rocks !!)"
5,Depeche Mode's flagship album,"If you only own one Depeche Mode album your whole life, Violator is it. It's rightfully an ""essential"" album. It's probably their best written collection of songs. Each song can stand as a single, so it's different from other albums in that each song doesn't blend into the next to form an album-wide theme or mood like say, Black Celebration. But each song is a gem in itself and can stand alone."
5,DM's best,"After having listened to some six of their albums, this is by far the best one I've encountered, with only one main shortcoming: it leaves you wanting more, since it only runs for 9 songs at approx. 5 minutes each. This album was such a pivotal point in their careers that their 2001 Exciter Tour DVD (ten years after the album was first released) showcases the album's three best works: ""Waiting for the Night,"" ""Enjoy the Silence"" and ""Personal Jesus."" Yet, incredible tracks like the brilliant ""Halo"" and the intimate ""Blue Dress"" are missing... The point is this is one incredible album you can't get enough of. Though there have been some great works following it throughout the nineties, 'Ultra' is the only one that comes remotely close, and 'Violator' retains the place of Depeche Mode's best production to date."
2,another poor remaster,"Let me begin by saying that I love Depeche Mode, and this is one of their best albums IMHO. Unfortunately, this remaster is like so many others from the 80s with a bloated mastering level and squashed dynamic range. Compared with the original CD it sounds thin and fatiguing. Maybe this is a conscious effort on the part of record producers to make the sound more friendly to compression to MP3 format or to listening on a portable device with really poor earbuds. However, when played on a high performance system the sound really suffers. Listeners are encouraged to check out this phenomenon [...]. Do yourself a favor and hold on dearly to the original CD. It sounds much more potent and involving. The same goes for other remastered music from the great 80s. Regard the remasters with a healthy dose of skepticism. Rock on!"
5,the sweetest perfection!!,"This is my favorite album of all time. It is not only DM's best but the best of all synth/new wave. This album has such power and emotion behind it. The feeling u have when u listen to it is unexplainable. If everyone on the planet owned a copy of Violator silly as it sounds.. I think the world would be a much calmer place. and if there was such a thing as perfection.. this would be it. I wore the cd out back in 1990 when I lived in Germany where Depeche Mode are gods and I continue to do so. My favorite songs are Halo, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth.. ok ok so I can't name just one.. LOL the whole thing is a masterpiece!"
4,"Good, but not my favorite.","This is Depeche Mode's most well known and most successful album till date. This album contains the band's top single tracks, Enjoy the Silence, Personal Jesus, and Policy of Truth. This is a good album with good quality Depeche Mode music and the singles Enjoy the Silence and Personal Jesus make this album worth having. Both of those tracks are great and Depeche Mode classics. This is definitely a DM album to have in your collection of classics."
5,you CAN wear out a CD,This is the most I have ever played a CD. You will be able to listen to this CD back to front over and over and over... I would say this cd had to be worth hundreds of dollars to me... thanks DM
5,This album contrives every known emotion man has felt.,"From ""Clean"" to ""Policy of Truth"" to ""Personal Jesus"", DM's catharsis of tunes knows no end, neither in dark and cyncial moods or fast, upitty wit. If you are a pessimist or optimistic, happy or sad, christian or satanist, you have to at least give this one a chance before deeming it ""dull"". I did a dance to ""Enjoy the Silence"" that rocked with two other dancers. peace out. david gahan is very intriguing, i hope he has given up the drugs for good."
2,I got mine autographed!,"Jasmine Guy was the star of the hit sitcomA Different Worldat the time this album was released in 1990. There was actually a hit song from this album (""Just Want To Hold You"" reached #34 on the charts). Jasmine has a good voice, but this album sounds too much like a lost Paula Abdul album. It has that same kind of ""late '80s early '90s R&B; influenced pop"" feel to it. But it's still better than most albums recorded by actresses."
4,Good Effort,"I bought the cassette in 1990 and even though I found some of the songs very corny, I enjoyed the album overrall. I always wondered why Jasmine didn't make another album. The songs "" Another Like My Lover "", "" Try Me "" and "" Just Wanna Hold You "" were top jams even if the album didn't sell like crazy. Ms. Guy is not the best singer in the world but she's better than Paula Abdul and Brandy so that should tell you something. Jasmine's album has flavor and dynamic hip-hop beats that will keep you jumping. It was the perfect House Party album for the early 90's and though it's lost some of its power now, it's still a lot better than some of the crap released today."
1,Hoodman LCD cover - cheap,"I bought the H-D80 for my new Nikon D80 camera. The hinge pins on the side panels snapped right off the very first time I flipped it open, and no wonder -- turns out they are just tiny thin little plastic pins, even though this is an obvious stress point. This thing certainly isn't durable enough for day to day field use. Wasted my money!"
4,good set of movies,"My husband likes all the old westerns, and everything wyatt earp. So when he received this set he seemed pretty happy. Anyone who enjoys the old westerns would love this collection. Good quality collection."
4,When will this hit DVD? And will there be extras?,"Whenever I catch this film on The Western Channel, I get sucked into it every time and watch the whole thing.My favorite Peckinpah film was and probably always will be THE WILD BUNCH, in my opinion the greatest Western ever made, but I still really enjoyed CABLE HOGUE. Loved the cast, loved the offbeat characters and storytelling, loved the ""community"" that forms in the last gasp of the Western frontier. It's an affectionate take on the humanity so often missing in shoot-em-up Westerns.Plus, Stella Stevens is absolutely stunning. She's photographed in such a way that she doesn't look like she's wearing a molecule of makeup, making her look like a natural knockout.I haven't seen all of Peckinpah's films but I think this one shows us his heart more than any of them."
5,duh,"If you like westerns and you consider yourself a collector of films and do NOT have this title in your collection, then I am truly sorry for you. Jason Robards is fantastic in this, and the story is put together brilliantly!"
3,Not without merit despite juvenile comedy and Peckinpah's misogyny,"Confounding expectation, Peckinpah's follow up to ""The Wild Bunch"" is a broad comedy. The humour is on a pretty juvenile level though and a scene in the middle where a drunken priest (David Warner) consoles a grieving woman is particularly idiotic and demeaning to women (one could write a whole thesis about Peckinpah's misogyny and generally warped attitude to women). Despite this, Peckinpah does recreate the atmosphere of an old Western town and extends the boundaries of the Western genre."
4,Ballad of Cable Hogue,"Good movie, Just as good as when I first saw it. Priced right, very good western. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in good old westerns"
5,as good as I remember...even better with my ageing,"I first saw it as a minor art house single feature in Buffalo 1970. Peckinpah Shmeckinpah.. I had not seen The Wild Bunch and knew not a whit about the director. The movie stuck in my mind for 36 yrs. I found it serendipitously through a NYTimes DVD review.GOT IT! and was enthralled with the nuances of cinematography,casting, performances and most of all story. It is a Western classic YEAH (David Warner) bordering upon the ultimate depiction of the life and death of an era. The framing of the introduction is magnificent. Overlook the anachronism of Stella Stevens hairdoWatch, and be enchanted with what films USED to be."
1,Terrible,"You really need to go out and get a life if you can enjoy this one - the story line about a man who finds scarce water in a desert he can exploit for monetary gain is uninspiring, the gratuitousness sexuality is debasing, and it's distortion of things sacred is demonic . This not a B-Movie, it's a C-movie."
5,Oh yeah,This is a must have for Sam Peckinpah fan's.Everyone of these movie's are keeper's for sure.We will enjoy these movie's in our collection.
2,Good idea and all...,"but it just wasn't executed correctly. This game has nice graphics and cool tracks, it's just dull and boring. Suprising because Team 17 had a part in it, and they're the team behind the popular Worms Series, one of the most addictive series ever made."
1,it was not very good at all it had bad graphics hard to play,"it was not very good at all it had bad graphics hard to play, it had very easy scenarios...the people who made it should have spent at least a month on making the game, jeese..."
2,"New edition, tired ideas","This is clearly a book for those who wish to see the world only one way and are willing to take ""old"" articles as the basis. This is a text required for grad school---a diversity class. While some articles are timeless, e.g. Wright's ""The Ethics of Jim Crow"" that should be in any textbook for its stark reality; other articles have the appearance of something written 10 years ago for the New York Times---that may have been kind of ""edgy"" at the time---today, are but rehashed concepts that don't move anything forward as to social justice. Admittedly conservative in my view point---I am always looking to expand my horizon---it just won't happen with tired rhetoric. I will keep this book on my shelf to remind me of the close-mindedness of those who beg for others to open theirs."
4,For a sociology class,It came right on time and there wasn't any problems with the ordering or shipping.
1,Worst book I've ever read!,"Wrong wrong wrong!!! Totally NOT diverse - completely slanted against all white people, has a serious socialist agenda and is borderline treason in some chapters.The statistics seem to be outdated and according to a dear friend and professional - who happens to be black - the black community that is portrayed appears to be very antiquated - I wonder what part of the country they are getting these statistics...These authors should be glad that they live in America - if they lived in another country and wrote stuff like this about it - they'd be tossed in jail or killed."
3,"Race, class and gender in the United Staes",The book is a text used for a class by the same name I found it interesting and informative.
1,destroyed game,"If you take the Lakers against the Clippers and every Clipper shoots about 80% you know there is a problem. The only sure way to score is driving to the hoop. Outside shooting is unpredictable. Open shot - miss, double team - good. this pattern was over and over again. Skip this game and avoid frustration."
1,Just Left Me With A Headach,This game was the worst I'v ever played. The graphics were bad and the game play was impossible. It is true that the only way to score is to take it to the hoop. There are no real special parts about the game. I think you should just ignore this game because no good or fun comes from it.
3,"not brilliant, but pretty good","This book does indeed have many ideas for helping you deal with sleeping problems. However, most of the ideas are fairly obvious. For example many chapters tell you to relax before going to bed. Good idea - but I'd already thought of that one! Most of the ideas are similarly obvious. Not a bad book - but brilliant is an overstatement."
4,Very Good,"I really liked this book. I knew a lot of the songs that were mentioned in it and if i didn't know them i looked them up and fell in love with them. Krovatin is obviously a natural at writing, he makes you feel the anger, pain, and confusion that Sammy(conan) goes through over Melissa and with his friends. You also feel like you are in the story. This book is obviously a can't-put-down book, and you get into the story from the get-go."
2,"""Heavy Metal""? Well, maybe a LITTLE...","I wanted to like this book, I really did. The writing was decent, and the story wasn't BAD, but the ""metal"" part of the book seemed forced to me. It was the story of a young man who likes to party, who has friends who like to party, and then falls in love with a girl. The metal parts of the book couldn't almost been added after it was written. ""I made her a mix tape, and here are the bands on it,"" he basically says (not word-for-word). Wow, impressive. I wanted the metal to be woven into the story, but I just didn't feel it.This writer has the gift, though, and definitely has potential. I look forward to more from him in the future."
2,I have to disagree with most of these reviews,"It's easy to tell the author is just embellishing his own thoughts and experiences, and what it really comes down to is he's just full of crap for the most part. He is name dropping bands left and right and trying to give a quick crash course in the rise of Norwegian black metal before turning around and talking about bands like Shadow's Fall. Anyone who actually pays attention to the music when they hear it knows this band is worthless metalcore crap. He also prefers Possessed over the band Death. Yikes. I eased up on the judgmental stuff when I saw how young he was, but it didn't excuse the repetitive nature of the writing itself. He spends much of the book with the same setup: the metal head character screws things up with his too-good-to-be-true girlfriend, has to apologize, and they make up until it happens again. Some of the dialogue is funny, some of it is just bad. It was a quick, easy read for a few days on a train, I'll give it that much."
3,Good Movie with Two Exceptions,I thought this was a pretty good movie and western with two glaring exceptions. They are David Arquette and the girl who played Kelly Bundy on Married with Children. Both are very poor actors and are completely out of their element (whatever that is) with these other pro's. Jeff Bridges is great as usual. The story follows pretty closely to the real life legend of James Butler 'Wild Bill' Hickock. I enjoyed it. Lots of good action and also some very funny moments. Also the costumes and set designs were very good.
2,a dissapointing departure from history,"Although Jeff bridges does a decent job of depicting the title character, the writers took great ""artistic license"". If you want to watch a fictionalized and somewhat depressing western this is fine, but if you are looking for either high adventure or historical facts don't look here."
2,this movie does not pay Wild Bill his due,"Wild Bill has never had a modern movie made about him, including this movie. I was expecting something alot better along the lines of 'Tombstone' or 'Unforgiven'. Lets hope someone makes a much better movie about Wild Bill very soon.Go to wikipedia and read a short bio of Wild Bill Hickok. He was a friend of Buffalo Bill Cody, a scout for Gen. Custer, a noted lawman and gunman, and the original 'dime store' novel action hero. Why didn't they make this movie.....I'm waiting."
4,Good action film,"Typical walther hill style : action, sophisticated violence and humour. May be too much of sergio leone influence . Very good jeff bridges acting"
4,Testosterone booster...,"I loved this movie! It didn't do well until video. I had never even heard of it until I was at Blockbuster. Jeff Bridges plays an excellent Wild Bill. Tough, gritty and sure of his immortality. And Ellen Barkin is a lovable Calamity Jane (more women should be like her!! hehe) Anyways, this film could have delved more into the Life of Wild Bill as compared to his death. There are great scenes in this movie, but it is hard to digest on the first viewing. The first 2/3s of the movie is kinda hacked up bits and pieces of Bill's life. I would have liked to see more of his earlier years that led up to the man who became a legend. But, it is very enjoyable and makes for great testosterone boost. Ladies probably won't like it (my wife hates it), but a great movie for the guys and a lot of beer.!"
2,Big Jeff Bridges fan but...,"This was ok and Jeff Bridges did an excellent job but somehow this was missing that overall spark. A good western but a little flat. Other than Jeff's performance, nothing really stood out."
3,"Bridges shines, but plot fizzles","The opening scene of 'Wild Bill' is standard. A flashback movie based with an emotional back story; which makes up the majority of the movie. This western truly stands out as different which becomes its major advantage and flaw.Jeff Bridges plays the main role of James Butler Hickock (a.k.a. Wild Bill) and HE is what makes this movie entertaining. Bridges uses all his tools to show the hindrances of a lost, but determined man. His body language is brilliant, as is his line delivery, but that can't save a flimsy plot which is also horrible inaccurate.Ellen Barkin does a great job playing Calamity Jane and the rest of the support cast also show their mettle; excluding a horrible performance by David Arquette; who can't work with a skilled actor like Bridges.All in all, 'Wild Bill' is a different western, but relies too heavily on the lead role with a story that seemed to be written backstage at a 'Doors' concert."
3,So-so,"Really wanted to like this, but didn't really. I think the direction needed to be better, and perhaps the screeplay could have used some punching up. Worth seeing, but don't rush, and do not pay full price for this."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This is a real page turner -- an absolutely riveting, compelling thriller, about family secrets, romance and murder."
2,Disappointing,"This book came highly recommended, but I ended up sorry I'd used the time to read it. The beginning is excellent; the main character and her nearly-pathological needs are absolutely riveting. But as soon as the plot begins to move, the character retreats to normalcy and the magic dies. Then it's a very ordinary story of family problems and secrets, made even duller by lack of logic: WHY do they let this stranger do as he pleases? WHY does the main character, again and again, not ask the next question that anyone would ask? WHY did nobody hear a horse moving quickly through the empty forest; Why no hoofprints; why is everybody so dam*ed dumb that you'd shake them except that you don't like them enough to bother?If this is a typical Gilbert novel, I'll pass on the rest."
5,THANK YOU! I FOUND IT,I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS BOOK FOREVER! MY SIBLINGS AND I LISTENED TO THE RECORD AND READ THE BOOK UNTIL BOTH FELL APART. THE BOOK WAS IN GREAT SHAPE LIKE THE SELLER SAID. MY CHILDREN AND I ARE ENJOYING THIS SPECIAL CHILDHOOD MEMORY:)
4,They laughed at first!,"I must admit, I thought the idea was rather cute considering we don't have a fireplace and the holidays were upon us. When the family heard that I had ordered this tape they laughed, (and laughed loud :< ).....HOWEVER, it wasn't long before I heard comments like, ""Hey, this is kinda cool"" and within minutes we were all asleep in the living room nestled around the ""fake"" fire! (The sounds of crackling wood needs improvement)"
4,Fireplace in a box,Next best thing to having a fireplace. I've used it during parties and it's always a hit.
3,OK...but where is that one song??,"This soundtrack is ok, but where is the one, really incredible song that is playing while she is arriving in Rio? And what is it called? Having this song on the album would make it complete."
2,Where Is That Song!?!?,"Why isn't the song where Carre Otis is arriving in Rio on the album? Thats the best song in the movie! Also, where is the song that is heard when Otis and Rourke go to that masquerade club!? The rest of the songs stink."
3,it served its purpose,"I needed to get one track and because I couldnt get it via mp3, I had to buy the whole CD. I wish they could have sold me just the mp3"
2,Michael B Wilkins Sr,"All the music on the disk is the same that was in the movie, however the quality of the sound on the disk was not as clear as it was in the movie. I wish that itinerary on the CD was closer to the different scenes from the movie. The movie was a blockbuster which after viewing made me want the CD."
5,Wild Orchid Music,"This CD is a very appealing mix of international music. Although the movie was made in 1990, it doesn't sound at all dated. The love theme is beautiful and haunting and most of the other music is happy and upbeat."
5,Essential Hip Hop!!!,"This collection showcases Hip Hop during the time when it was just beginning to creep into the mainstream. The golden age of breakdance had passed and now it was the music itself that would carry the artform into households all over the country. Nonetheless, in 1986, Hip Hop was still firmly rooted in the underground. Daytime radio was still years away from fully embracing ""rap"", so it was left to night time/weekend DJs like ""Super Rockin"" Mr Magic"" (along with his all-star engineer Marley Marl with the gloves on)to bring recorded Hip Hop to the masses. The joints presented on this CD are a nice representation of Hip Hop knocking on the mainstream's door (Walk This Way), and at the same time staying true to the streets (Coast To Coast-whoa!). I remember hearing Marley cuttin' up all these joints on ""Mr Magic's Rap Attack"" at a time when Hip Hop was still something special and not the norm. Cop this CD, throw on your Kangol and get your wop on! Guaranteed satisfaction!"
4,Great Mystery!,"This book was pretty good, though not very exciting in the beginning. The author really developed the characters well, and that made you think it could have been anyone writing the letters! I do think that the beginning could have been a lot stronger though, because it didn't really capture my interest. I almost stopped reading it! But, it gets a WHOLE lot better as the story progresses, so I would recommend this book. Just keep reading! It gets really good and action packed!"
4,One of Christie's Finest,"This is a great book. The story is being told by Jerry Burton, an appealing narrarator, very human. Although the plot is great, the mystery nearly impossible to figure out, subtle clues presented throughout the book, this may make a better read the second time around, since its fun to find things that people said that meant more than one thing. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that Ms. Marple, Christie's charming lady detective, is called in as ""an expert"" where the local police have failed- vaguely reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes... She is hardly in the book at all, she simply explains it when the whole thing is over. Jerry Burton takes the limelight as the actual detective. Still, this is definetly one of Christie's best, and I highly recommend it!"
1,service stinks,i placed my order on jan. 21st.i was notified today feb.9th. 2012 that opticsale still has not shipped my item. extremely poor customer service. buyer beware. p.s. i sent email today to cancel order.
2,wow ! it broke ?,"I have used butler creek flip caps for over 15 years and have never had a complaint until now. In fact mine get quite a bit of use, they dont just sit in the safe.All I was doing was sighting in my new scope that also had my new butler creek flip cap attached ... and the cap broke at the hinge. Like it was brittle. I was absolutely stunned. First time out and it broke. Very surprised."
5,Excellent,"These are great. They fit tight and open easily, protecting my scope when I got through woods. Haven't experienced any accidental openings either."
4,KC-36IP Paper/Cartridges,"I've seen a few reviews rating this product poorly. Howver, for me, it's worked great for printing business cards. The printer colors are slightly different on the actual card than in Photoshop, but I just adjust in Photoshop until the printout is right, then print away."
5,Great find,"I almost gave up on finding this product, I was extremely excited when I found it on your site. I am purchasing more to have on hand."
1,not working,I got the same model that is required for this printer but the printer does not work and keep saying that it's the INK color code does not match the printer. I think they sent me the fake one!!!
1,This game is NOT worth $50,"If I could give this game less than one star, I would. Actually, it does deserve one star, it's not THAT bad. I mean, other than not being able to move the mechs or the point of view as effectively as you should, and the fact that the combat is ineffectually balanced, this game is fine. The controls are awkward. The way the mechs move is awkward. The PS2 is not a good platform for a mech game in the first place, because of the relative simplicity of the controller, but this implementation goes above and beyond the call of suck. Following what seems to be a trend lately of misplaced priorities, Tommo has made a very pretty game that plays extremely poorly."
3,It was ok,"It passed as an armored core game, but I wouldn't reccomend it to hardcore armored core fans like myself. All of the missions are duplicates of the missions you did in armored core 1. It's like AC 1, but with weirder weapons, NO ARENA, and NO ranking system!! I liked AC 1, because there was a ranking system, and that gave gamers another goal, besides beating the game or getting the best robot. After you beat the game, create the best ac, and collect all of the parts, there is nothing else to do besides beat ...your newbie friends, and that can get boring quick. I pray that agetec and software produce a better Armored core game for the ps2, such as armored core 3. I hope that armored core 3 is more of a challenge.LESSON: Get an armored core game, set it on Hard mode, forget medium. That way, you don't beat it in less than a weak (like I did Armored Core 2: Another Age) and its more of a challenge. There is no point in beating a game, then playing it again on a harder setting!"
4,not the best of the armored core seriies,"This game is pretty much a follow up of armored core 2 where ith has only missions(no arena to bad I loved it). However you start of being able to buy every type of secrete part in armored core 2 (including the KARASARA MK2) and some other patrs that you can fin or earn in the missions. One cool thing is that you can load up old armored core 2 dat to this game so youo can beet all the missions with your favorite ac! One stupid thing is that you can do a mission like attack the island base and then do defend the island base right after each other. One grat thing is that (caution spoiler) onece you get to start the ""lost field missions you can make overweight ACs! Also it brings bak some old memories when you fight people like stinger(project phantasama),stinger fussed with phantsama(project phantasma) and a ""super"" (and I MEAN IT) Ultimate nine ball.(master of the arena)"
3,A Rip Off If You Have The Original Armored Core 2,"I have always been a avid Armored Core fan....I have all the Armored Core titles and this one was a disapointment. When I first got this game I thought it would be great, but when I got home it turned out to be the same as the first Armored Core 2 but with new missions and a few new weapons. So if you have the original Armored Core 2 I recommend that you not purchase this unless you really want it. But If you don't have the first Armored Core 2 then you should consider buying this. Overall this game is pretty good."
4,This game is one of my favs!,Ok well when i first got this game I was not into mechs and stuff like that and when I played it I didn't even read the book. I played for about 5 minutes and then gave up but then I read the book and finished a few missions and made a pretty good mech for myself. Then my brother who is the same age as me saw my mech and began to play. We each have four different mechs and try to beat each other in the vs. mode. So this game is a good game to play with people who live right next door or in your house. My favorit thing though has to be the over boost but the reason I gave it a four was because the vs. maps arn't all that great. I like big spaces with lots of stuff in the way and my fav map is the destroyed city. any way its an all right game when playing by yourse;f but its better when you play with someone.
5,One Of The Best Games I've Ever Owned!,This game is one of the easiest armored cores.I even beat the game.This game is so cool when u beat the game u have so much money u can buy a whole lo of [freakin] parts.when u beat the game u can get parts from doing missions which equals powerful machines.i didn`t have 2 use the f*ckin strategy guide!! Thats how good i am with the game. this game takes some time but its worth it! The coolest thing about it is that on two player mode u can try your own made guy on your freinds while they use those pitiful original guys! This game is one of the best armored cores!! ALSO THEY ARE COMING OUT WITH AREMORED CORE 3!!!If u need help on this game email me at- Zeeks0083@hotmail.com
3,Portrait of the Artist as a Young Fogey,"Do not give this author any more acid. Patently, he is well past his limit."
1,One of the most overrated authors in the uk fails again.,"With every literary effort, Blincoe is digging himself a new hole. Not only does he not understand the subject he pitifully tries to write about, but he does it in such a yawn inducing way as to warrant an health warning; Do Not Read Blincoe Near Heavy Machinery. As many have said before, Blincoe is a poseur and charlatan and Acid Casuals goes further than any other of his projectile vomits to sustain this belief. God only knows how he manages to get into print. Don't buy it...It's a swindle!"
4,Slightly better than FIFA 2004,"Consider this game an expansion pack with some minor tweaking. You get the tournament, which is nice, but you also get a slightly enhanced soccer experience. The player animations seem to be slightly better and there are more animations. After only playing a few times, I swear the speed is a bit faster than FIFA 2004. The box notes different weather conditions, although I still have not seen rain, which was missing from FIFA. Anyway, the game is very good and if you are a soccer (football) nut, you should get it."
3,A bit disappointing,"Essentially Fifa 2004 dressed up to be a Euro tourney game, obviously EA didn't bother fixing any glitches (like the darn ref writing on his hand and then magically a yellow card appears).English keeper David James has had dark hair all season, but he's still blond in the game.The game play is decent and all, and the controls are cool, but that was the same with Fifa 2004. This should be sold for about [edited] instead of full price."
2,not as much fun as I'd hoped,We just got back from a 14-hr car ride. I had high hopes for this toy but it didn't go over as well as I'd hoped. The magnets are too easy to lose - there are 2 in the car still that I can't find. I also found that my 4-yr old wasn't interested so I disagree with the age range. I've found that lots of toys recommended for 4 yr olds are not things she can play with on her own because she can't read yet. My husband and I had more fun with it than she did!
2,"Nice concept, but didn't work well","I got this for a trip with my 6 yr old nephew in summer '08 and unfortunatley there were no reviews of it yet, but my experience was the same as the other two who've since reviewed it. The magnets didn't stick well and there wasn't room to have them all on the board at once, so you were constantly losing them. Even when we weren't using the game, they didn't stay on the board and in place when it was packed up, so the magnets were all over the place. Also, they weren't all accurate to what the state's most common plates look like, so he had a hard time matching them to reality if he couldn't read the state's name on the real life plate as the car was going by. Nice idea, but it just didn't pan out."
5,"Flawless transition from disco to slick, catchy 80s grooves","One of the better 80s albums by a disco diva, Thelma Houston (of ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" fame), shouts, wails, and cries her way through a stellar set of old-school grooves that would have made then-fledgling Janet Jackson jealous. And why not? Some tracks (including the superb ""You Used To Hold Me So Tight"") were produced by the now-legendary Harris-Lewis partnership that would make so many dozens of hits for Miss Jackson. Definitely an album worth paying the steep price for."
1,THIS CD IS MASTERED FROM VINYL!,All of the CDs from the PTG label are fakes (including this one) and are mastered from cheap vinyl and not the original source master tapes!
5,"As good as a ""best off"", this CD is actually better!","This CD rocks! With ""The Good Liars"" behind him (Bruce and Pete Thomas are just two members), this is JWH's first album and perhaps his best. Loaded with metaphor, the lyrics reflect creative and intelligent song writing, whether sung to a rocking or more mellow tune. A great horn section accompanies on a few tracks so the music never becomes dull--you can listen to it straight through time and time again. Whether you are into folk, just getting into it or not even interested, you'll love this one."
3,Sammie,"I think that whoever has an opinion of not liking Sammie, that is something they are missing out on. The song that is my absolute favorite is ""I Like It."" It shows that he has lots of feelings for a beautiful girl. I think Sammie is FINE! But that is my opinion. Sammie shows love, thought, and tons of feelings in his C.D. That is why I like him. This thirteen year old boy needs alittle credit too! He may be young but he has a great voice! So listen to this fine male singer and think of me when you hear the song ""I Like It."" Thank you! Vote now..."
4,cool,This CD is pretty cool. IUn a few songs i thought it was a girl singing but he's only 13. I do like Aaron Carter better but Sammie is #2 in kid singers because I think kids should be able ot make it just as big as the adults.
5,The Best,"This cd is the best.My favorite song is ""Crazy Things"" but I would like to let every one know that they should listen to his interlude called ""when I grow up"".It sets a real good example of how the world should be and how living things should be treated equally.He is so cute and I enjoy listening to him and N-toon.They are all the bomb!So buy his cd,it's great.OK"
1,The Metal Fan's Review of Sammie,"Sammie (if that is his real name) is a wanna-be rapper. And a bad wanna-be rapper at that. I have more talent than him (seriously), yet he is the one with the record contract. For shame. He thinks up his lyrics the day before the CD goes on sale, and the music is really a problem, too. If this world was right, he would be sitting in some school, failing all his tests. He would drop out of high school and be a gas jockey all his life, until he died of a cocaine OD at age 31."
4,Great CD,"One of the best CD's this year. He is like a mini new edition getting started, menus the other four Guys."
1,why are little children singing?,"I have been listening to music for over 6 years, but I am not satisfied with this recording. I respect Sammie as an artist, but he is much too young to understand the content he sings in his music. I am against little children getting record deals. He can't really sing and I think he has a serious lack of talent. Maybe when you are older Sammie"
1,"""Chicken Little"" in 300 pages","The first half of the book, set in New York, wasn't particularly convincing. The second half, set in London, was ridiculuous. It sounds like it was written by someone who spent a weekend in London after reading an article in an inflight magazine on the Thames Barrier. The attempt to evoke a sense of impending doom by describing Londoners packing a supermarket, with kids tearing open packets of M&Ms; is about as convincing as ""the young cop struggl[ing] to inflate a dinghy by blowing on its tube like it was a balloon. His face swelled up with effort"". Puhlease! A shortwave radio for weather reports? In London?If Reggie Nadelson wants to write a weather catastrophe novel, maybe she should stick to North Carolina or Florida.Of course everyone gets to live happily ever after at the end, even though none of the real baddies have been brought to book, and they're supposed to be the sort of ruthless characters who will have you killed for looking at them crooked."
1,Didn't Get Past Page One,"It's rare that I give up on a book as fast as I did this one, but life's too short to plough through writing this dismal. On page one I doubt if there was even a single sentence with more than four words in it, and the writing conveyed just that - words, no significance, just letters strung together to make dull words. My review of this single page has taken more time than I had ever hoped to spend again on this book after I left it lying on a table in a university lounge. Call it altruism. Anyway, perhaps some spaced-out student would get some pleasure out of it. They say that drugs can do that, you know."
2,Only a classic,"I bought this movie only cause its a classic! but the restoration to blu ray format, it really sucks, the image its the same as a dvd, and the sound its the same as all old movies of 30 years, they didt do nothing to make it better.So, its only for my collection, but i do not recommend it on blu raysorry!"
2,brain pain,"I've been on a recent trip down memory lane looking for movies when Eddie Murphy was worth watching and came across this by chance, so i decided to spend a few minutes of my life on it.What a mistake, Murphy's character is empty and undeveloped while Nick Nolte is just terribly in his portrayal of a drunk cop let loose who can't seem to catch the perps who killed a cop in front of his eyes with his police issued weapon."
1,Save your money- not worth the upgrade to Bluray,"The movie itself is as entertaining as it always was, but this is one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I've ever seen. No special features either. If you already own the DVD, you're good to go. Save your money or put it towards something else. Very disappointed."
4,Bare Bones DVD but still a classic movie,48 HRS. is a good combo of action and comedy. Edddie handles all the funny stuff very and Nick plays a good cop. The action sequences by the stylish Walter Hill were some of the best in 1982. The film is full of action and comedy and is a real crowd pleaser. I remember reading somewhere that the role of Reggie Hammond was oringally written for Gregory Hines or Richard Pryor and one wonders the tone the film would have taken if either played the role but thankfully the chose who Murphy who carried the film very will and became a star in the making.
4,Forced Partnership,"Eddie Murphy followed others from SNL as me emerged from Mr Rogers sketches and began his movie career. It was 1982 and people wanted to laugh as the US economy was struggling back from its worst period since the great depression. Eddie Murphy teamed with Nick Nolte, who got his fame as the bad boy brother from ""Rich Man Poor man"" and EM and NN were tremendous together. This movie created a lot of ""buzz"" where I worked and of course we got a 48 Hours II. Nick was the big star payroll wise, but in his first movie, EM shows the promise, which I believe he has fulfilled in becoming one of our greatest movie actors. For sheer talent is there anyone better than Eddie Murphy?I give this only 4 stars because of the language and violence which makes it not family friendly. So put the little ones to bed, sit back and enjoy."
3,"great movie, terrible DVD","The movie gets four stars: see the other four-star reviews to see why. It's a great, fun, rough movie. Murphy's great and Nolte is very effective in his role.The DVD transfer gets two stars for a bare-bones non-anamorphic DVD release. The image quality is good -- I can see very few artifacts on my screen, with very solid blacks -- but it's inexplicable to me that Paramount would not by now have released a special edition of this movie, with a proper anamorphic image and possibly a commentary."
4,never to be forgotton,"This movie may look slightly dated now, but Eddie Murphy's film debut in this flick still remains one of his best. I still find parts of this movie simply brilliant, and Nick Nolte's performance is equally as good, as cop Jack Cates and convict Reggie Hammond constantly spar verbally and physically, but with the same goals in mind. The performances and strength of the characters really bring out both the drama and comedy in this film, which balance superbly.I won't bother going into the story as many other reviewers have done this, but this movie is simply hilarious in places and is a must see for anyone who likes an adult-comedy movie. For the record, the sequel is equally as good."
1,Blu Ray Bad Picture Quality!!!!,"Bad, crappy, horrible picture quality!!! 48hours is the best action comedy of all time! Why doesn't the director, producers , studio, or someone involved with it feel the same way I don't know. Someone needs to fix the picture quality. Don't buy this Blu Ray version unless you have to have it."
4,48 Hrs,"48 Hrs Is very funny although it takes long to be funny when the movie first starts,and I am not a Nolte Fanper se. I enjoyed it and Part 2."
4,BOSOM BUDDIES REDUX,"48 HRS, a nifty actioner from director Walter Hill, is considered as the buddy movie upon which future films of this ilk would be judged. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy certainly had a sharp chemistry in this tale of a veteran cop who ""borrows"" convict Murphy for the titular 48 hours to nab a prison escapee and cop killer, played luridly by a young James Remar. The action is fast and furious and Murphy in his first big screen breakout overcomes his foul mouth with a good turn, especially in the critically lauded scene at the redneck bar. Sonny Landham and David Patrick Kelly are suitable villains but lovely Annette O'Toole is wasted in the role of Nolte's sometime lover. However, this is a very entertaining film and shows why Murphy became such a hot box office property at the time."
3,It is different on TV,"I had seen this on TV so many times that I had forgotten how much they use the ""F"" word. It's too bad...they have a great story line and Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are very funny together...if you can get past the language."
3,Cop and Robber catch bigger robber,"Confortable formulaic action flick with some silly, laughable racist overtones, but Nolte/Murphy fans will enjoy the action and constant slapstick. Nothing great but worth a few laughs."
5,great flick,"it's good to watch any eddie murphy movie uncut and commercial free! would like to have his whole collection, great actor"
2,Too African,"This group seems intent in pushing their african roots too much, like they have a chip on their shoulder. They also choose to praise the Cuban regime, which says it all....low class sentiments."
4,ghosts of fun,"Happy Returns is a welcome sequel to Brief Candles, story full of fun and games as two ghostly heros (and their pet ghost monkey) return to earth to help relitives and do other good deeds. When Charles and James Latimer, with the ""help"" of Ulysses the monkey are around there is sure to be plenty of action, as dishonesty smells bad to ghosts, and they always know who is up to no good. Those with bad records who really want to go straight get help as well.This is a period mystery, set is the 1950's with the ghosts having died in the 1870's. The book itself is a high quality trade paperback printed on acid free paper. It has been out of print for years, and very hard to find, so this reissue is a blessing to all those who love the work of this British author (team actually, as Manning Coles is a pseud. for Cyril Henry Coles and Adelaide Frances Oke Manning) and can serve as an introducion for those who haven't yet discovered them and are lovers of ""golden age"" mysteries."
4,Happy Returns,This is a light-hearted story that is a reminder of France and french villages in the 1950's with ghosts that you'd love to meet. Even the villains aren't all that bad! I have loved Manning Coles books for 50 years now and am delighted that they are available again. Thank You!
2,Very Simple Guide Book,"This book is too simple, does not tell much about each function of the camera. The manual that came with the camera is actually enough.It is alright to buy this book if you loss the manual."
4,Good book for beginner photographers.,"I recently purchased the Minolta XTsi/HTsi guide, and I beleve it was very helpful. The Minolta XTsi camera I purchased is the first camera I have ever really handeled, and the book helped me understand what each button did, and how to use each function. It also helped me learn how to create better photographs with my camera. I really reccommend it if you have purchased either camera or are thinking about it. It has helped me out alot."
2,To bad these books are the only choice,I know they are written for the novice--but even the basics are not explained well
4,WHAT CAN HE MEAN?,"Though not essential, this certainly is helpful in understanding Joyce, if that is possible. I did find myself referring to it less and less as I read more & more of Joyce. I was going to go back and reread this all the way through, but like many of my intentions..... Definitely worthwhile for a student, useful to the casual reader of Joyce."
2,"I am glad the author has found his way back to the Lord, but the outright distortions and deceptions are troubling.","I would advise those who are interested in Medjugorje to read the books by Michael Jones and Donal Foley for a more complete and accurate picture of Medjugorje. Please note the Roman Catholic Church has in NO WAY authorized these alleged ""apparitions"" in Medjugorje as approved for personal belief. In fact, the Bishop of the diocese in which Medjugorje resides has written at least two opinions that the Blessed Mother is NOT appearing there.If you can get your hands on The Medjugorje Deception by Michael Jones I believe you will get a more balanced view of Medjugorje. I truly would hate for someone to go to Medjugorje and lose their faith instead of increasing it."
1,FALSE VISIONS,THE MESSAGE BY WAYNE WEIBLE DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CONFLICTINGREPORTS AND BIZARRE STATEMENTS MADE BY VICKA AND THE REST OF THE SEERS IN THE EARY DAYS OF THE APPARATIONS-1981-1982.THESEMESSAGE ARE MISSING FROM MOST BOOKS ON MEDJUGORJE AND THE READER IS LEFT WITH A SANITIZED AND EDITED STORY.
1,Waste of Money,"This book did not have hardly any good advice in it, I think I donated to a book sale because it was not worth taking up shelf space."
2,Ouch,"I love quotations so I bought this book and paid a great deal of money for it only to get disappointed so many times. There are great sayings inside but when you come across movie titles such as ""From russia with love"" - then you come to the point to put the damn book into the fireplace. I mean what sort of quotation is Ian Flemming's book/movie title ""From russia with love"".I have trusted Oxford's name but from now on I'll be skeptical before I buy any of Oxford's book of quotations."
5,My Lethal Weapon's my......Rhyme,"Yo yo. Iceburg is as fresh and crisp here as the lettuce that bears his name. Ice-T and da rhyme sydicate be all up in here, and their word is bond.The album starts of the same way as Black Sabbath's first album with the opening riff and thunderstorm, while a haunted church bell tolls for thee in the distance. It ain't long before Evil E is cutting crossfades and the MC of MC's be busting out the dope fly rhymes.Afrika Islam and Donald D be in da house too with rhymes and rap that takes no smack. Peeling caps back, sexual adultrous escapades, and a thumbed nose to 1989's notorious PMRC.The freshest word you ever heard. Iceburg."
5,Old skool Ice-T,this albulm is one of his best. it's got great beats and lyrics. Ice-T is just tha man you can't say much more than that. also has a guest apperance by Jello Biafra from Dead Kennedys.
1,Ultimate Warrior SUCKS,I've not seen this dvd yet. This is one I'm staying away from. For as long as I've watched wrestling and bought video's and dvd's I can't stand this man. The only way I'd watch this is if my friend burned me a copy of the two dvd's. I'm glad McMahon fired Warrior from the WWE
4,Not Too Bad,"I liked it. I thought the WWE was fair in their analysis of The Ultimate Warrior. His promos were really funny as hell and off the wall. For the majority of the people interviewed on this DVD stated they didn't like Warrior, apparently Warrior has/had serious issues. My only beef with this DVD is that I wished the Warrior could provide his own side of the story and took part of this DVD as Bret Hart and Jake The Snake did with theirs. It's worth buying and I hope the WWE comes out with a Ravishing Rick Rude package. A true Warrior fan may not like this because they may feel that it's nothing but a Warrior bash but for me I thought it was fair."
4,"Good, but misleading advertisin","The self destruction of the Ultimate Warrior is an interesting DVD in that the advertising for it makes you think every hates the guy. However upon watching it you realize that is not the case. In fact some of the guys have respect for the guy (especially the younger crowd), but some do downright hate him.The DVD chroniclizes the Ultimate Warrior career from his days as one half of the Bladerunners to his final in ring appearance in WCW. They mostly talk about the character, his promos, and what happened backstage.However don't expect to hear from the man himself as the Ultimate Warrior had nothing to do with this DVD, and the special features are even less satisfying. Only a handful of matches.Overall the documentary is entertaining, but with a lack of special features, and misleading advertising, definetly not their best effort."
3,Just unfair,"The DVD is perfectly well done, except all the people who spoke about the Ultimate Warrior like Boby ""the brain"" Heenan show no respect for him even as a person. It's not fair to destroy a person without letting him speak about the way he acted or the misteakes he made during the character or gimmick at the WWF then WWE. That's why 3 Stars is fair. I really hope one of these days The Warrior can speak and let us know the truth or the reason of his behaviour at that time."
3,Ultimately Average,This product was valuable for its nostalgic value. Memories of this time period were enjoyable but the matches were just average. This athlete probably was not capable of much better.
1,the self destruction of ... my wallet,"Other and the ""AWESOME"" Pick your Poison Jake the Snake dvd, I don't buy dvd's centered around one wrestler, but I decided to make and exception for this one since I was curious and it was cheap. I wasted my money, I bought this dvd because I wanted to see the Ultimate Warrior made fun of. I never liked him and always thought he was a joke. They could of done so much with this documentary, and they missed the mark BIG TIME. Other than Bobby Heenan there is nothing good about this DVD. The background music is too loud and awful, the interviews are done with little heart, I didn't believe he was as much as an idiot as I would like to think he is, because it seemed to me (again other than Heenan) that everyone was reading from script written by McMahon, and not their hearts. The extras were piontless, and the Christian impression was disappionting. Oh well, off to the Salvation Army with this one."
1,"Warrior Fans, DON'T BUY THIS!!!!","Encase you didn't know, the Ultimate Warrior and Vince McMahon have been on bad terms for a number of years now. The WWE wanted Warrior to participate in this DVD, but they couldn't come to terms.So typical WWE and Vince McMahon showing no integrity, they decided to bury him in the DVD. This DVD makes a mockery out of him, completely bashes him. Ultimate Warrior reiterates this statement and completely bashes McMahon on his website (most of which is blatantly honest criticism.)If you're a true Ultimate Warrior fan, DO NOT buy this DVD and put more money in Vince McMahon's pockets. You'll be doing no justice to the good memories you have as a wrestling fan years ago.Why would Warrior fans want to buy a DVD bashing him? Just another example of WWE profiting off of the stars of the past because their product today is absolutely horrible."
5,the baddest man ever lived,I really can't believe that the man himself the Ultimate Warrior didn't want to share his side of his own story this dvd is talking about him when he first started in the WWF. Vence Mcman was glad he fired him. The Ultimate Warrior had a match with Hulk Hogan back in 1990 at Wrestle Mania for the worlf Heavyweight championship Hogan lost to the warrior. The Warrior came to WCW to face Hogan when he was in the NWO he stayed for a while then left never to be seen again. In the WWF the Ultimate Warrior kept on fighting the undertaker the undertaker put him in a casket buared him underground they dig him up and the warrior was throwing up green stuff.
2,Pure Character Assassination,"Just watched this DVD and found it to be purely and simply a revenge piece by Vince McMahon against somebody that crossed him in the past. It was completely biased and one sided. The best part of it to me was seeing a match between HHH when he first started in the WWF and comparing him to how he looks today. The guy looked like he weighed 200 pounds. Now after a steady diet of WWE he looks like a huge bodybuilder.Anyway, this DVD has some good footage and some of it is funny but back in the day of the Ultimate Warrior there were lots of goofey and cartoonish characters in the WWF. This is something that is not pointed out. From what you see on this DVD Jim Hellwig was a jerk, a liar, a scumbag, and a miserable ungrateful person. Nice to see that they were impartial."
4,Great DVD... unless you are a die-hard Warrior fan.,This DVD was very good and very informitive. It takes a look at the Warrior from the eyes of those who worked with him. They take a very fair aproach on discussing the Warrior. The only problem with the DVD is that it more matches. Great DVD for any wrestling fan!
2,Disappointnig,"I bought this dvd hoping to gather some insight on The Ultimate Warrior's career.Without actually interview The Warrior himself, I felt it was one sided.No matches of him in the WCW?No mention on his fued with Jake The Snake Roberts (which in my opinion was never resolved.)Should have added more matches."
3,Twisted but entertaining,"There are three sides to the story. WWE's, UW's and the Truth. This is WWE's side. I think the extra disc should have been included since it is unlikely another warrior dvd will ever be released. WWE is obviously slanted in telling the story but it is to be expected. UW's side would probably be the same. The whole truth will never be told.Hogan was very complimentary throughout the dvd. UW opened the door for short term wrestlers. Examples: Bill Goldberg and Brock Lesnar. (Though they are not mentioned)Warrior also believes he is bigger than Hogan. Whatever!Hogan is the greatest attraction ever. Not the greatest wrestler but this is entertainment.Warrior will be remembered by me as intense and good attraction as one of my favorites.One more thing WWE just tried to put UW in the 2010 Hall of Fame. Hypocrisy on the part of WWE when they utterly trashed and tried to bury him.Source:[..]"
5,Warrior is a LOON!,This DVD should prove to be most interesting. Warrior was one of the most intense wrestlers of all time... too bad that's just about all he was. This DVD is said to have interviews from both Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff about what it was like working with this nut job. I can't wait to watch this DVD.
1,Riot,"This dvd was funny and makes you wonder why people liked this fool. They skipped around in the 90's, and forget about him being locked in a casket by the Undertaker. The matches were a big yawn, and WWE has a wealth of matches but refuses to put some unseen gems on dvd. Warrior Vs Andre or Warrior VS Undertaker would have been a nice change to the already seen Hogan title match or retirement match with Savage. Seriousally, why Vince? Did you run of ideas so you decided to mock wrestlers who screwed you in the past? Who is next on your list? Best of Doink? Koko B. Ware?"
4,Here's a first....,"Apparently, this WWE DVD was supposed to be made with Warrior (unlike Bret Hart, who has somewhat mended the fence), according the official comments from WWE; unfortunately, THIS is the reason why they RIPPED him hard on this instead: when the fans made him the top wrestlers and he just say ""f*** u WWE!"" in return, and then insulted just about everyone else like the minorities, per se, on top of it all. Need we go on the fact, he was also the reason (directly or indirectly) why Davey Boy Smith is no longer among the living. While we can say he has what it takes to be a pro wrestler, his mind is ""so out of it"" that the people once loved to see him succeed, is now ripping him badly. I can't wait to see what details it'll bring."
5,"small, practical, durable and improves mic reception","The title says it all, there is not much to add. (but amazon will not publish less then 20 words)I bought because I like my bluetooth headphones on my cell phone since the receptionis great. With this noise suppressor the quality of my voice for others really improves."
1,Bad Deal,"I purchased this iron and after about three to four uses it died! I am an advid iron user and this really disappoints me that this iron is a piece of crap! I have been trying to get it fixed, but to no avail!"
5,Jane's maddening search,"I bought this iron about a year ago and I absolutely love it. I too only use distilled water. My mother came to visit and fell in love with it as well. It irons everything so quickly. I was able to steam iron a formal dress with no problem. I decided to purchase one for my mother and it was defective, so we returned it. I went to order another one and now I can't seem to find one. Amazon has had me on their back order since January 28 2006. I hope to get my hands on one soon. I would definitely recommend this iron."
2,About ten minutes of solid Sam.,"Sam Kinison is one of the best and most creative comedians I have ever heard, but this CD is an enormous disappointment.The first track is a meandering 33-minute set that is only occasionally funny. It could have been edited down to ten great minutes.All of the other tracks consist of Sam and a band performing covers of various hard rock classics. They're not bad, but I did not buy a Sam Kinison CD for music."
2,Pass on this one,"One lukewarm standup set, and Sam delivering several songs with a good backup group in a decent screechy-white-guy singing AD/DC style. But overall quite disappointing."
2,Excess is not always best...,"Poor Sam began to read his own reviews around the time he made this album, and it shows. Four useless heavy metal covers at the end (and a lot funnier than most of the comedy bits), and a smattering of classic lines. Worth a listen, but not much more than that. You'd be well-advised to buy any of his other albums instead."
2,Leader Of The Banned,Unless you don't mind playing good money for 33 minutes of comedy avoid buying this CD until you've heard some of his better material. There are some flashes of brilliance but overall a disappointment due to its length. The music tacked on the end seemed to be a poor way pad the length of the CD. Louder Than Hell & Live From Hell are better bets.
2,Very disappointing,"Get ""Live from Hell"" or ""Have you seen me lately?"" if you want comedy. Get ""Leader of the banned"" if you want to waste your money. Where is the comedy?! There was one real joke on the album, and it was done much better on his other albums."
5,Great guido for children,This arrived earlier than expected and looks just like the image on screen. It is a great prop to have in a classroom. The guido is very sturdy.
5,The Paperback edition,The paper back edition is what I want for the church to distribute to their young people so they can know the meaning of the 23 rd Psalm from an expert reviewer
5,Gombrich's The Story of Art: Great as a textbook!,"I have specified this book as the main text in GPH-205, Historical Foundations of Visual Technologies, which I have taught for eight terms running at DePaul University. The book is superb as an introduction to traditional western art (and a few side trips into Chinese, middle eastern, and ancient art). I pair this up with Colors by Delamare and Guineau to flesh out the technical side of artistic endeavors along time periods that parallel those covered in Gombrich. Students really appreciate the fact that the 400 artworks Gombrich describes are located on pages facing the discussion, a practice that has been maintained through most of the editions of this text. The text is very readable, the discussions lucid and of appropriate length for the purpose of an introduction, and the book reflects the polish possible with a book that started out with a good premise and was refined and expanded over a period of fifty years!"
1,The condition mismatch description,"First, it's not hard cover. Second, the book is almost broken, rather than being described as almost new. However, the content of the book is fantastic."
2,Well I had the same problem as Batshua and A Music fan,"I did not read the playlist or the reviews before ordering this CD. I assumed that it would be exactly the same as the first one I bought. The original one I ordered as a 2-disc set and I ruined my disc-#2, so was looking for an inexpensive replacement for it. Now I have 2 disc #1's and still no disc #2. They ought to mention this at the top with the CD artwork. Very disappointed."
3,Go for it,Can't go wrong withJohnny Cash and SUE.You certainly can'tgo wrong with HarryChapin and The Cats in the cradle.Personal fave of mine is Harper Valley PTAThis one has a lot of classic songs. It has a lot of DUDS too.But for the classicsongs on this. I'mgoing to say GO FORIT.
2,cut version not up to snuff,"I was so excited to find this cd for less than the rediculous price it's sold for on tv only to be let down when I realized this version, with the exact same title and cover, only has about half the songs as the other. As it turns out the songs I really wanted aren't even on this one. There needs to be a big sign on the front of the cd to warn customers they are not getting what they think they found."
4,Cool Gizmo for the ipod owner on your list!,"This device works so much better than EQ feature built into the ipod settings. If you have tried any of the multichannel surround DVD-Audio or SACD releases, this is the ipod answer to taking your headphones beyond the stereo experience. As a lover of several types of music, I can say this makes most any song sound like it has been remastered. Some of the artists who I have sampled with this range from Roxy Music and Pink Floyd to The Who, The Killers and Led Zeppelin to the Finn Brothers and Bonnie Raitt. Rock, country, jazz, all sound new and improved with this device and a pair of headphones!"
4,Make your own metamusal...,"I gave it only four stars because it was not blond but darker... but it works the same and it, like the blond is flavorless."
2,It's okay.,"It doesn't do the job too good like it's suppose to. I Ordered it and it's good when you drink it but it's not too much of a good cleaner. It gets you gassy, thats all."
2,Taste like dirt!,"First of all, I usually love Now Foods products, and there are not too many foods or supplements that I will not eat if they are good for you, but this stuff taste like pure dirt - actually worse! It works very well, so I took it for about two weeks, but finally got tired of trying to choke it down.For me, there are better sources of fiber that don't taste so bad."
1,too fine,psyllium husk powder mixes very poorly in water compared to whole husk. in the future I wll only purchase whole husks psyllium.
1,"Absolutely horrible, had to throw it out","this is hands down the absolute worst psyllium husk product I have ever bought. Okay, I know it is supposed to thicken, but it was so god-awful lumpy even after stirring it forever I found it nearly impossible to get down and keep down. Never again. It ended up in the trash and I bought some Yerba Prima instead. On the plus side, Amazon did give me a full refund when I requested to return it."
2,Bought the wrong stuff!,"The rating is partially for my inattention to detail when ordering this product. I thought that I was ordering the ""Whole Husk"" version of this psyllium, but ordered the ""Powder"" instead. We love the whole husk for our protein drink in the morning, which keeps us right and regular. The powder does not provide a very good consistency compared to the whole husk. The powder makes it get too thick and barely drinkable. I would recommend to anyone to try the whole husk as opposed to this powder stuff."
4,good product but a word of caution,"I have been taking metamucil for years and got tired of taking the extra sugar, I bought both this powder and the whole husk. I was having the whole husk by popping a spoon full of husk in my mouth and drinking water. I take 6 spoons every night. I tried the same with this and nearly choked on the dry powder after the second spoon, this thing expands quite fast and also sticks to your mouth. It took me hours to partially clean my mouth off this sticky powder. I am going back to the whole husk till I figure out a better way to consume this."
5,It does the job,"I like the organic. It works well. I know when I don't use it. I like to put it in my protein drink in the morning, I can't really tell it is in there."
5,Great for everyday and best price,"I bought this because Dr Oz said to and now I take it every day. Mix with your favorite juice, use a whisk type electric blender in a tall glass, mixes perfect and easy to drink, I put two heaping teaspoons in a tall glass with cranberry juice, mix about half a glass first and be sure to get it all mixed up good, especially the bottom, then add the rest of the juice, no clumping, easy and smooth to drink. The cranberry cleans the urinary track and the Psyllium cleans the intestines and colon, lowers your cholesterol, keeps you regular and on a daily high fiber diet! 12 lbs is about a 8 months supply for two people, drinking daily. Every friend I get to try it does it every day like I do. Once you lived on a high fiber diet you don't want to go back to how you use to!Dr :D"
4,Works great.,"This is an excellent product, it performs as expected. The only issue is that it's difficult to hand-mix in water, but it works great in blender drinks."
3,"Works well, the whole husk is better","After trying the powder, I can say it certainly does it's job! However, I much prefer the same brand, but the whole husk much better. The whole husk disolves better and it easier to get down. It's almost like pulp in your orange juice, if you like that. I can drink this with just plain water, but have tried it in juice and even mixed in at night with some almond milk or soy milk. Not a bad way get this down and do the job. I strongly suggest trying this in the whole husk vs. the powder."
5,great cable,good quality - extra long - fits good - what more do you need? i would buy again and outfit my whole system
1,Blew out our speakers,"We bought an awesome turntable from Amazon for Christmas. But, the cables are VERY short. So, bought this to set the turntable next to the tv stand (so we can open the lid). Got the humming other reviewers said didn't happen and discovered it had blown 3 of our surround sound speakers! So, beware when hooking this up."
5,Awsome,"I wanted to give my baby an appreciation for different music and cultures. I started playing it at bedtime, now this is the only CD he will listen to for bedtime. Everyonce in a while, I will put in another CD and he screams until I put this one. He then settles down and goes to sleep. So, needless to say, I love it!"
5,Gritty and realistic.,"Great tank game. You get to pick either being a Tank Commander from the German, Russian or American side. You will soon learn the ins and outs of driving a tank and fighting with tanks. You will learn, from playing the game itself, the merits and flaws of each tank. How fast do they move? How powerful is their guns? How fast can you spin the turret? How much punishment can they take?Don't get too cocky and try NOT to panic. While light tanks might seem easy to kill, they're not. They move fast and can aim even faster. While heavy tanks might seem slow, they carry the big guns and can take hit after hit. Pick the tank that best fits how you like to fight and go do it! Remember, luck is also a factor. A well placed shot can turn a tank into a burning pile of twisted metal.Make sure YOU fire that shot!"
5,Best Tank simulator ever made!Hands down,"My brother bought this game first and after playing it for five minutes i had to have it.How underpowered was the US Sherman tank?Play the true story of Barkmans corner where a single German panther took on a whole division of shermans.Almost all of the battles are true stories along with each individual characteristics of armor,fire power,speed,etc..No other tank/combat game comes close.Once you learn the controls you will play for hours!"
4,Lively neo country offering,"This is a really fun CD, though a bit uneven. Back when kd was being sold as ""country"", she fronted a crackerjack band and dressed up like a funky librarian. Give it a try, it's really different."
4,Laughably Dated but Surprisingly Solid,"The ""how to please your man"" tone had my inner feminist cringing a bit, but most of the advice was quite solid. Respect for yourself and your feelings, a giving attitude, and acceptance of the little foibles that all men and women are prone to will make you happier and more exciting in bed. Ms. J has a no-nonsense, big-sisterly style that is quite assuring. Her advice about ""veneral disease"" is strictly 1969, but even there she has something timeless to say - ""If...there is something wrong in the genital area, don't sit around frozen in fear, run to the gynecologist."" For the most part she says what countless others have said since - Self-confidence is sexy and taking responsibility for your own pleasure is even sexier."
5,A Great How-To Guide for Three Decades!,"A friend shared this book with me on a plane nearly 30 years ago. I shared it with my wife who was reluctant to broach the subject but who nonetheless slowly acquiessed. The results have been a very fine marriage. Thanks ""J.""HLL"
5,Still Spreading the Word.....,"I first stumbled across this book when I was 12 years old ,rambling through my Mothers belongs being nosy.She caught me with it , took it and hid it, of course I found it again and kept it hid myself for about 10 years. This booked should be shared eith EVERY woman coming of age..A treasured gift indeed.J in absolutely WONDERFUL in sharing knowledge and helping womenbe confident, within their own sensuality and sexuality. She is very detailed in every chapter. I sell this book alone with the sensual products I sell as a GREAT how to book, I can't keep them. A must for every woman....."
5,Still a fun read,This book was written mnay years ago but is still a fun read !Nice for a gag gift but only for a good friend !
5,A great start,"This great book takes you from western Europe and Russia to L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland in a gigantic arc of detail and archaeology. Many areas of great intrest such as the Isle of Man and the Shetland Isles are often overlooked in OTHER books but not this one. If you want to start learning about the Vikings disembark from here."
1,Stumbles and Pitfalls,"Although this catalogue is stunning in its photography, graphics and presentation, I was surprised and dismayed by its content. If the article in Chapter 6 entitled ""Stumbles and Pitfalls in the Search of Viking America"" is an example of the level of scholarly rigor, the authors have stumbled painfully with misrepresentations, unsubstantiated innuendos, blatant contradictions and a stream of factual errors. The pitfall, it seems, is an agenda established by the editors to discount the slightest consideration of evidence of any kind for Norse contact south of the Canadian boarder, reinforced by gratuitous remarks throughout the catalogue (we wonder by whom) denigrating pre-contact research. In all, this publication is an embarrassment to standards of American scholarship and a perverse use of taxpayers' money. The Smithsonian should be ashamed of itself! Suzanne Carlson, Edgecomb, Maine"
5,An exciting story about early America,"MIke Fink is a story with lots of surprises and great pictures.Mike was able to do many things that seemed impossible. If you want to read about a boy who was determined to get what he wanted, this is the book for you.Our whole class really liked hearing this story."
3,Lots of fun - but needs some extra toughness,"I bought this toy for my 3 1/2 year-old son while we were staying with his older cousins, and man did he play with it for hours every day that weekend. Unlike a story book, the child can move the pieces and make any picture they want. My son just kept on making up stories for all the characters, and was still playing with it for weeks afterwards. I didn't like that the pieces were not highly magnetic, but my son didn't seem to mind at all. The main problem was that the little pieces are weak cardboard, not plastic, and after they had been lightly played with they bent, and then started to fray at the edges. Before long, my son was tearing the pictures off the fronts. So, within the first day they were getting raggedy. He doesn't seem to mind though, and seems to have realized not to pull they any more."
5,Best of,"This is a nice collectors item that no doubt will be worth something someday. It's a collection of the ""best"" Josie and the Pussycat stories that have appeared in Archie Comics over the years. It features the very first story with Josie, Melody, Alexander, Cabot, Pepper and Albert titled ""A Gym Dandy"" from the comic ""She's Josie"" #12, February 1963. They also have little samples from when Alan M. and Alexandra first appeared in the stories, and when Valerie also first appeared. It goes through their music career as a band and their various friendships. It was nice to relive these stories. One of my all time favorite stories was not in here though, it was titled ""The Ghostly Guardian"" which appeared in the October 1990 issue of Betty & Veronica #21 Double Digest, where the gang visits an old mansion and discover a hidden passage, and a treasure. Overall this is a good paperback to own!"
4,great music and i love it,"I have always liked this album and so there is no surprise on why i rate it so much .. but why just a 4 and not a 5? the music is great but i am not happy about the quality of the CD i received .. the sound quality is ok, but the CD looks like a cheap quality and not like an original one .. the edge has some black shades or marks and it does look like a cheap imitation .. i wish that that i had purchased from music shop.. but i may not have got this price .. anyway, i should have checked first .."
2,4 good tracks and 6 stinkers,"Out of the 10 tracks, only four are worth listening to more than once. This album is nowhere near as good as Graceland. That's very disappointing considering all the good Latin sounds Simon could have chosen from."
2,the sequel,"If clever lyrics, great musicians and cross-cultural rythyms can win you a well-deserved grammy, then why not repeat the formula ?Here's why !"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"After the brilliance of GRACELAND, I was hoping for more in this follow-up. But the only thing worthwhile is ""The Obvious Child."" I try to listen to the other songs on this album, but I end up hitting the fastforward button. What a let down."
4,4 of 5,"The rhythm is a dazzling array of percussion, mostly African and Brazilian samba, from artists around the world. It's a soothing and ambient high that rarely lets you down. When the songs aren't great, because the melody of the lead vocals can't keep up, as on the Cool River, Paul Simon himself is to blame. But this is his best, most poetic album so far; timeless in the sense that live tribe music never dies. Even if you're not an Elvis Presley fan yet Graceland is one of your favorite places to visit, it takes some time to unravel the musical complexity and fully appreciate the beauty of The Coast, Spirit Voices and the like.marcellee.com"
5,Best Book Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the books I liked best! My favorite part is the cute little puppy the poor thing got droped off by a car wih a stranger in it and the poor pup was left alone,ggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!! The story was so good that I read the whole thing in one night!!!!!"
2,decent book for price,"Nice book, comprehensive overview of his work. I got another version which had more color illustrations and a richer look. Decent book for the price."
3,She almost got it right...,"I am glad Rachel has done a book about entertaining. As is her special talent, she showcases great new ideas for vintage items. However, I would love to see her do a book about entertaining in general and not for celebrities. I would give this book more stars if so many pages had not been devoted to Jennifer Lopez's restaurant - and I couldn't figure out why J-Lo had a tight budget. (I'm also wondering how the 'accidents' that happen in restaurants are going to keep those vintage china pieces in tact.) Next time I'm hoping for birthday parties for women, men, boys and girls. I would love to see Christmas, Easter, Valentines Day, Thanksgiving, or just theme parties for no reason. The photography, as usual, is gorgeous."
2,HUGE FAN OF SHABBY CHIC,"and very dissapointed with the latest book. I was hoping for HOUSEY pictures. I want what she is known for...... decor & pictures of beautiful rooms with beautiful one of a kind treasures. I would love to have seen homes or rooms she has done for clients. Or from her new home. This book just felt like a dissapointing waste of time. I can't believe anyone would be interested in seeing what Pamala Anderson did for her SONS birthday party. What I really would have liked to have seen is what she does for childrens room, master bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms, kitchens, This was dissapoiting."
1,Not What I Expected,"I was really excited when I heard that Rachel Ashwell was releasing a new book, however, this book is not what I expected at all. Rachel spends too much time on areas that I feel have no practical use for the average reader - such as Jennifer Lopez's restaurant. How many readers just happen to have a brand new restaurant that they need decorated in the Shabby Chic style? Each chapter is solely made up of just one function, instead of showing several different examples. She showed us how to decorate for one birthday party - a little boy's birthday. How about showing us some ideas for little girls, teens and adults? She completely skipped over any type of holiday gathering too. I thought she would have included several ideas for decorating the table for Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas but there was nothing mentioned about it. As a devoted Ashwell fan, I must say that I was really disappointed with this book."
5,truly wonderful entertaining,"i think this is her best book yet, but it's on entertaining, not decorating, so some ladies may not be prepared for this....."
5,best cottage style reference,"If you like the casual comfortable look of overstuffed slip covered furniture, this is the best reference you could buy."
3,Make that 3 and stars...,"Her version of Lulu's To Sir With Love is worth the price of the album; it's delicate, dreamy and ambient -- a great rendition -- and you'll get some other nice sonic suprises as well -- though all in all the songwriting here isn't stellar, it's still not bad. Nelson's career started when someone fronted her a big bunch of money to record her first (and it seems only) album. It's a shame that Warner Bros. didn't support her further, she might have had a formidable career -- though those days of labels carrying and nurturing their talent seem long gone."
5,an oldie but goodie!,"I first owned this cd 20 years ago, but it was lost during a move. I have, from time to time, thought about how enjoyable it was - one of my favorite 'cruising' cds. A few weeks ago, I 'googled' Loey's name. I found out the cd wasn't available anymore, nor had she done anything else. On a whim, I checked Amazon and there she was!! I was so hyped to find this cd and ordered immediately! The price was incredible, the shipping was cheap and delivery was fast. The quality of the cd is excellent! I am very happy with my purchase, only sorry I waited so long to find her again."
4,Amazing Film,"I love documentaries about people who do not quite fit in. These people and their stories are endlessly fascinating. My favorite movies are all documentaries on human oddities, such as Grey Gardens, American Movie, Salesman, Gates of Heaven, Stevie, Crumb, etc.. Perhaps it's because I have sympathy for the characters, which subconsciously makes me feel superior to them. Actually it may be empathy I feel; I can relate to many of them. I don't know.I can add this one to the list. With this one, you have the added element of suspected sexual abuse, which tears the Friedman family apart. You will find the story spellbinding, disturbing, and very sobering."
5,"Excellent, informative and gripping story","I remember watching Capturing the Friedmans when it first aired on HBO, and thought it to be a fascinating documentary about the chaos that rocks a community when allegations of sexual abuse come forth. Now, as a psycotherapist and educator, I use the video to showcase how sexual predators and pedophiles are n regular, everyday communities, and the difficulties of dealing with these allegations when there is doubt and confusion within the main characters. Furthermore, the Friedmans is excellent at highlighting how this crime (or allegations of it) are detrimental to a family, tearing it apart and leaving very little for the family to repair itself with."
3,Disturbing,This documentary just left me feeling disturbed by it. There was a icky feeling of distrust and confusion. David seemed to be Jesse and Arnold's voice - but he himself seemed to be so bizarre that I really questioned his validity. Cinematically surreal and well shot to provoke questions.
1,Damage Control,"Unbelievable. If a priest is accused of this crime, based on someone just remembering something thirty years later, he gets indicted and does life. Here, members of a jewish family get busted, charges are delayed until there is public outcry no arrests are made, and finally, easy sentences are given. Only Arnold, Jesse, and Ross Goldstien went to prison. Their sentences were so lenient that the judge incurred criticism. Now, a movie is made making the family out to be victims even though the old man and two others were caught abusing hundreds of young children and threatening their lives. Unbelievable trash from the synagogue of satan."
1,A true account only in hollywood,"The film is a very biased documentary; there is a ton of information that further reinforces the guilt of the father and son that has been left out to make it seem like maybe they didn't do it. The fact is that for as questionable as the film makes all this seem, almost all of the victims still vehemently claim that (a) they were raped (b) the police did not get them to make up stories (c) they were never hypnotized. If you have any doubt about the guilt of the accused, search around on the internet - it gives a much broader bigger picture of what happened."
5,A great American documentary,"This is a great American documentary. It is disturbing because it involves the sensitive topic of child molestation. It introduces us to a upper middle class family residing in Great Neck, Long Island NY USA. Father Friedman is a school teacher. He, giving piano and computer lessons, as he retired, in the basement of his home. In 1988, police discover child pornography in the office, he gave these lessons, in. The nightmare begins for this formerly upstanding family.Like most good docus, we do not judge this man and then his accused son. Riveting all the way to the end.Unfortunately, in the 2-disc set, the second disc is quite stingy in its extras. I haven't chequed it out, yet, but there are CD-ROM extras on DISC 2.Otherwise, excellent film. Highly Recommended."
1,Poor Workmanship,"I realize this is only a toy but the workmanship is poor. The map came folded and the magnets that do fit together will not adhere to the fold. Many of the magnets tore when being taken off the card, and this was done by an adult not a child. I expected the map itself to be metal or hard cardboard at least so it could be hung on a wall."
2,Not recommended,The magnets aren't very sturdy. Some of the states don't even fit together correctly and the magnets slip out of the book---it would be nice if it had a latch or bag or something to keep them in. I would only buy this if it was less than 5 dollars.
1,Just got mine & no bubbles at all =((,I just received mine and I set it up in my 10G tank and ZERO bubbles. Seems like it doesn't breath at all. I tried to scratch the surface a little bit & washed it under the tap to remove any debris... No go.Air Pump if good for upto 20g Tank. I'm amazed by reading the review that I'm the only one with no bubbles =((
2,Dissapointing,"This aquarium ornament doesn't work that well. Unlike in the picture, the bubbles don't come out in most places. Only a about 1/4 of it shoots out air bubbles."
1,Does Not work,"Bubbles come out of the first 1/8 of an inch.. what about the other 5 3/8"" ?Very Poor quality / garbage."
3,Decent aerator,"Pretty good stone. Lots of bubbles. Does the job fairly well. Bubbles could be finer and distributed more evenly over the length of the stone, but playing around with the installation (angle) helps compensate for uneven distribution."
3,Not very many bubbles,"Not very many bubbles coming out, even though I have quite a strong air pump. Sufficient bubble spreading though, so I'm still using it, but it really doesn't seem like a great product."
1,I didn't know it needed air pump!,DONT waste your money on this!! not should have told me that it needed an air pump and a tube with cost a lot more!! this is so stupid. i just wasted my money!!
2,"Nothing like the picture, barely any bubbles",I was looking for a new aerator after my old one wore out. I was very disappointed with this. I have four areas with big bubbles close to the hose fitting and nothing else. I ordered more than one aerator and tried another and had exactly the same experience.
3,Its ok,"I washed the stone and plugged in, the initial bubbles came out of 3 holes on the closest end to the air tubing. I left it that way for a few hours and still had the same issue. Disconnected the air tube from the pump and with the airstone in a bowl of water, I blew as hard as I could into the tubing. Bubbles came out throughout the entire bar. Plugged the bar back in and put it back in the tank.... works fine now.Not something we should have to do but at least its functional now I guess."
2,Disappointed,"I could never get this thing to work right. I soaked it for an hour before hooking air up to it and could only get about 2 inches of it to work. I soaked it again and no improvement. I even tried poking bigger holes in it, setting it in my tank at different angles, but could never get more than 2 inches of it to work.It is not an air pump problem because now I have a 12 inch and 6 inch stone running perfectly fine off the same pump."
2,Does not work as shown in the photos,"just received this from Amazon. Price was great but the product doesn't work as advertised, at least in the photos. Bubbles only come from the first 3 inches of air stone. My guess is that my pump is too small and if that's the case, the description should state that you need a pump with enough force to get the full benefit of this product or it should be made to accommodate various pump strengths (adjustment knob or something). I have a 50 sized pump made for a 10gallon tank. A 75 or 100 would probably do the trick and get this to work properly."
4,"Works well, as described","Lots of bubble, but that's probably due more to my strong air pump. Bubbles all across the bar, the bar is bigger than I expected, pretty wide as well."
1,Bubbles don't go across (1/5 had bubbles),"I wanted to believe the other poor reviews were not representative of the product, but I got burnt with a dud. Stay away."
1,Not worth it choose another don't waste your money.,As many others have commented the bubbles only come out on about 1 inch of the 10 inch item.. Don't waste you money on this as it is more or less junk.. I have to buy one that works now...Oh well.
4,does an ok job,Go to youtube and copy and paste in300 Gallon Plywood Tank - Build and Advice - CheapestLook for the video made by redneckcomputergeakI built this tank using this part it works great and has held up great
2,Good bubbles for a very short time,"I put this 5 1/2"" wand in my tank a little over a month ago. Now only half of the bar produces bubbles. It was great while it lasted but if I have to replace it every time I clean my 55 gal tank, it will be too expensive. I will have to look for other brands. Most of the Penn Plax Air stone I have bought lately just don't last long. They are made in China so what I bought maybe counterfeit or they just aren't making good quality anymore. It seems that the pet stores around me only carry this brand and I think one other. Not much to choose from."
3,Genius loci and then some,"The film to most people can be a bunch of colorful fluff with a few grains of thought. That is until the object or place strikes the heat of the viewer. Then the film must be re-watched with the view that other observers see and feel what you just thought was fluff.However, it could have been presented better. Is it just a place or an object that invokes a feeling or is there something real about the place it's self.Maybe it is because I live in America, However I could all of a sudden woke to the purpose of this film when they showed the Star Spangled Banner over the Capital. However in that segment there was someone there to explain what we feel and why. Most of the rest of the film was background noise.I cannot believe they missed Watts Towers. I grew up nearby.1957 Watts Towers Architecture Film on DVD: Simon Rodia's Nuestra Pueblo Los Angeles Watts District Landmark"
4,Tranquilizing film,"Tranquilizing film, beautifully shot, traversing five continents in a search for those things in which we invest ""mana"" (power, significance, energy, meaning), e.g., money, nature, flags, trees, religion, cars and ... of course ... Elvis. (Would have appreciated a caption noting where each segment was filmed, but perhaps the creators wanted it completely universalized.)"
4,good value and assortment of brushes,Well-made set of brushes with a good assortment. The construction is pretty durable and the bristles are stiff enough for the most part. I had hoped the frame and long-reach brushes would have had stiffer bristles so they could be more useful. Unfortunately they're a bit too soft for removal of caked-on mud...not a big deal though. Great price for this 5 piece set! You won't be disappointed.
2,BRUSHES ARE STIFF!,"I bought these because it's a great price for a set of brushes. However, after using these brushes 3 times now to clean bikes, I've realized that the brushes are just too stiff to work properly. The two 'bottle brush' type brushes and the one that looks like a skinny paint brush are almost useless because of how stiff the bristles are. And the big tire brush I haven't really found a use for. But, the cog brush is great. For it's purpose the stiff bristles are a plus.If I had it to do over again I would just buy the cog brush for $5 since it's the only one I'm getting any use out of (I still use an old tooth brush to clean the chain)."
2,Four instead of five pieces,"I received four pieces instead of the advertised five pieces (no brush with metal handle). The brushes came in a solid black nylon bag, which is probably better than the pictured mesh bag. I got the brushes primarily to get another Pedro's toothbrush (the brush with bristles at both ends). This brush is stiff enough to do a good job removing mud and oily gunk from the drivetrain of a bike (and frame if you do not mind micro scratches), and is also good for removing oily sawdust from the drive sprocket area of chainsaws. However, I got the set because I thought some of the other brushes might be similarly stiff and give me more options for removing such materials. That is not the case. The bristles on the other brushes are relatively soft like the bristles of paintbrushes, which are not useful for cleaning a bike, i.e., too soft for removing mud and oily gunk, and a rag works much better for things the brushes could remove like dust."
5,Versatile Brushes,"Lots of brushes in different shapes for different jobs. Heck, I even reshaped, and dedicated one of them to brushing my cats. They actually like it. The bag is handy too. They work."
3,Cinnamon,I was intrigued by the name and I like cinnamon so decided to try. Very good flavor; similar to other cinnamon flavors that I have tasted.
1,Read with Caution,"I say read with caution due to the nature of this book. In the act of naming grace, Hilkert makes one major mistake; she neglects to actually name grace. Trapped within her Thomistic and Kantian structures, Hilkert fails to grasp that grace has a name rather than existence as a disembodied, ethereal noun. Grace is the Word made flesh-Jesus Christ. Thus, from the outset, her system and thoughts on preaching are flawed due to a limited understanding of what he Word is that is proclaimed as well as its relationship to the sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist. While there are glimmers of beneficial material, overall one should take this book with a grain of salt."
5,A must for the serious student of Fillmore's writings,"Charles Fillmore is one of the great metaphysical thinkers and writers of our time, writer of some dozen classic works. A study of his complete works is rewarding to any serious about metaphysics, and this concordance is a valuable tool so that you can compare his writings on any subject through the span of his career. His philosophy did develop over the years, and through the concordance, one finds that his theories did develop over the years."
3,a bit spotty,"This one's a toss up for me. While it contains some of their best singles ever ( Blue Savannah, You Surround Me, and Star ) it also has the ""is it camp or it is not camp?"" of the song Gloria, with its ill-advised attempt at Latin rhythms. Also, Drama, while once one a favourite of mine, I now see as the overwrought expression it is. And the lyrics are just incredibly heavy-handed.( ""The infinite complexities of life""....INDEED). 2,000 Miles and Brother and Sister are two more songs that reach for greatness but ultimately fail, due to the lyrics. Seeing as the best of the songs on this cd were released as singles, and therefore included on the POP! cd ( their first, and best, ""BEST OF"" ), I can't really see the necessity in owning this one."
4,Moving In A New Direction,"For all it's worth, I have to diss any critic that complains that Erasure are nothing but a sub-standard verse-chorus pop band. After just releasing the succssful ""The Innocents"" album and ""Crackers International"" EP, Erasure decided to experiment ""a lot"" with their next album ""Wild"". I admire Erasure for doing this, but yet I was disappointed when I first heard it. Many people I know that like Erasure say this is one of their favorite albums. I have it say it's not one of mine. However, there are some great songs here. And like always, the songs I like the most weren't released as singles. My favorites are ""Brother & Sister"", ""How Many Times?"" and ""Crown Of Thorns"". So if you like Erasure and just think ""POP"" represents their best, know that you are missing even better music on all of their other albums. Yes... better songs. Can that be possible? Yes it can."
5,Essential album of Irish piping,"This is an absolutely marvellous album primarily of Ennis' piping (he plays whistle on a couple tracks). Unaccompanied, he frequently makes full use of the regulators in his very rhythmic, utterly unique style. Along with albums by Willie Clancy and Leo Rowsome, this is essential for fans of the union pipes."
5,Our Faith in Christ,This author gives us a real look into the heart of someone who has an unbridled faith in the Lord. She gives us a daily devotional that can apply to our everyday modern life. What a comfort and knowledge for our spirits! This books leaves you wanting more.
1,DVD Didn't Work,"I bought this almost a year ago. Every year on Christmas Eve, after we have a seafood feast (an Italian tradition), we watch the SNL Christmas Past DVD. It's hilarious, but we were getting a bit sick of watching the same DVD year after year. I purchased this last year to watch instead, but the DVD didn't work. I never did get around to trying to return it, etc. It was a bummer. We watched the old DVD instead, but I really wish this one would have worked."
2,"Good Writing, Poor Storytelling","Having read some of the other reviews, I have gathered that this was not the best book to introduce the reader to Saul Bellow. Unfortunately, this is my first attempt at reading Bellow. At the very beginning, I was very impressed with his vivid description of people and their situations. However, some 20-30 pages into the book I began to wonder when the descriptions would end and some kind of story would begin. Perhaps I am just not used to Bellow's style of narrative, but I found this one very hard to get through, despite its very short length. Somewhere down the line I may attempt to read more by Bellow, but at this point it's not real high on my list of priorities."
2,cardboard cutout characters,"Unfortunately, I chose this book as an introduction to Saul Bellow's writing. I can see from other reviews, by people who have read other Saul Bellow books, that I made a mistake. I thought the characters were 2 dimensional at best, and annoying at worst. I am not a fan of short stories, and maybe novellas fall into that category, too. I can, however, see that Mr. Bellow's insights and language are interesting and creative, and I will try to read him again, but this time I'll choose a full length novel, one that I've actually heard of, for example."
1,An Aptly -Named Theft of the Reader's ValuableTime,"There was a time when I thought no one wrote self-indulgent pap as well as Bellow, but in light of A Theft, I may change my mind. The other reviewers seem to agree on the absence of plot; I suggest that this novella receive goose eggs in the character development and dramatic tension categories as well. Considering how beautifully Bellow can write when he's making the effort, this book is particularly offensive. Note to Bellow newcomers -- don't give up without reading Mr. Sammler's Planet."
5,Great childs book if you love otters,This is a great little book if you love otters or have a soft spot for books about the california coast. Otto learns some great lifes lessons in this adventure. Great for preschoolers.
2,Okay,"It is okay, but could hardly tell I had put it on. I just didn't know what a illumination blush was. I was just looking for blush."
3,Good Reference Book - doesn't cover any vb,"I was hoping for some information on vb with access. But, over all it will make a good access reference book."
2,Opalya,This cream does not remove rough skin in any way. What it does is moistrize feet and elbows. The name of the product is so misleading.
4,I have a problem with rough heels and ...,"I have a problem with rough heels and have looked for a product that really does the job. The Dr. Scholl's pedicure cream does that job. The peach scent is wonderful and a plus to the product. The grainy texture takes some getting used to, but it's a plus to the product and helps achieve results. The product is easy to use and very effective. I'll probably purchase this product in the future."
5,CLASSIC ALBUM!! No hip-hop collection is complete without it!,"This is a classic rap album, but hip-hop purists already know this. Back when MC Ricky D and Doug E. Fresh were runnin' things, Dana Dane was the other accented MC. Anyone who was raised on hip-hop from this era could tell you that they bought this album for ""Cinderfella"", but what they ended up with was a record (or cassette tape) full of gems. This is now in compact disc form, and anyone who had the record or tape back then cannot fulfill their cd collection without this! Of course, even the CD is nearly impossible to get now, but if you come across it, you had better not let it get past you."
4,"Underrated, still a good album","I enjoyed seeing this incarnation of Fleetwood Mac live. Onstage Rick Vito and Billy Burnette were a great addition to the band. However, while I do enjoy this album, I listen to it mostly for the tracks by Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks. I think it's truly underrated and often gets raked over the coals - unfairly so, I believe - by many critics and fans. Stevie Nicks, while a great counterpart for Lindsey Buckingham musically, proved many times over she did not need him to write good music and create hits. Christine McVie was, in my opinion, a better writer than Lindsey. Lindsey's strength (at least at the time) did not lie in his songwriting ability (""Go Your Own Way"" and his cuts from Tango In the Night are obvious exceptions). His strength was in his production capabilities. This version of Fleetwood Mac was not better or worse, it was just different."
5,mesmerizing the more you listen to it,"it took me several listens to get the feel of this album....but once i did, ohhhh baby!! it is pretty mystical and mesmerizing. the only songs that are not really sensual-like are stand on the rock and when the sun goes down. they are more rock-like. stevie's songs are touching and haunting ie freedom, and second time. christine's songs are just great!!! ie save me, and skies the limit....these songs are moderately fast-paced, yet softly fast with her soft and rich-toned vocals which add a sensual element. billy burnettes and rick vito's vocal blend wonderfully with christine's and stevie's especially on do you know, and in the back of my mind(which is an eerie and hauting, yet sexy song. overall, i'm really impressed. and i like this better than even the self titled ""fleetwood mac"" album, although the song on that album ""landslide"" is pretty hard to compete with!!!!"
3,"good album, but not great","This album shows how important Lindsey Buckingham was to this band. He consistently wrote great songs, not to mention he was also a talented producer. Many of the songs on this album come off sounding flat, particularly Buckingham's replacements of Rick Vito and Billy Burnette. Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie sound wonderful as always and manage to save this album from being a disappointment."
2,Why Did They Bother?,"Post-""Tusk"" Mac generally comes off like the band was treading water. Where ""Mirage"" and ""Tango"" have some redeeming characteristics and killer songs, this album has scarce amounts of either. Make no mistake, THIS IS NOT THE FLEETWOOD MAC ALBUM YOU WANT TO BUY if you want a fair representation of the group's music."
2,......,"Behind the Mask, a victim of production. Obviously it is. Great songs, ""Affairs of the Heart"", ""Save Me"", ""Skies the Limit"", ""Freedom"", and then some. This could have been a great album and it needed to be at the time. Unfortunatly though, it only proved how much Fleetwood Mac depended on Buckingham's production. Depite the great songs, there are some truly terrible ones as well, usually contributed by Burnette or Vito and they just bring the album down further. The exception to that rule being In the Back of My Mind, which could've been fine if it weren't for the bizzare three minute intro. That is the story of this album. The production is terrible, and to top that, it's so blatently early 90's that it just gets worse with time. In effect, the album is only interesting to dedicated fans who will be able to read through the mess to see the great songs that lie underneath it all."
2,A letdown,"I thought I couldn't go wrong with this album after the glowing review it got in Rolling Stone. I was wrong. Some of the problems can be blamed on Lindsey Buckingham's departure, but I doubt he could have done much to salvage it. The songwriting is substandard and the production lacks focus. New members Burnette and Vito try to inject a blues influence, but it comes off as contrived. The Vito/Nicks collaborations wander aimlessly (""Love Is Dangerous""). Christine McVie's four lightweight but catchy contributions are this record's only redeeming value."
3,An Abomination!,"Look, this isn't as bad a Mac entry as 1995's ""Time,"" by any means, but does anyone really think this album needed to be made? With Lindsey Buckingham's departure the Mac brought in two merely competent professionals, Rick Vito and Billy Burnette, to handle guitar chores, and Don Henley collaborator Greg Ladanyi to produce. The result is a polished piece of humdrum, so safe and sedate in nature that it brings to mind Toto at their creative peak. Though Stevie and Christine are still present, there is a surprising lack of panache in their songs--could it be that Lindsey's producing talents really did make a difference on the other records? Why are there practically no Vito/Burnette compositions on the album? If you want Fleetwood Mac sounding great without Lindsey Buckingham, pick up 1974's ""Mystery to Me""; at least Bob Welch had something of value to contribute to the Mac's legacy."
1,Embarrassing,"When Lindsey Buckingham left the show, it seems that Fleetwood Mac was left to flounder. This album proves it. Almost every song is bad. Nicks only true contribution is Love is Dangerous and Mcvie's is Save Me. Hard feelings is decent but this album is just GOD-AWFUL! Skip it."
1,muddy sound,just listened to this cd- terrible sound maybe its good- but since it sounds like im underwater or in another room like its muffled id say 1.98 or whatever I paid was to much
3,"Not great, but not to be overlooked","I was not around during the mac's blues beginnings or their glory days in the late seventies, so I believe I can give a fairly objective review of this album. Lindsey Buckingham wrote some great pop music for Fleetwood Mac, no doubt, but I did not miss him on this album... anyone who listened to his solo albums is aware that he was going through a dry spell, anyway. The best songs still belong to the ""classic"" members of the band, but both Vito and Burnette have material that is not just filler between McVie's and Nicks' songs. Don't expect Fleetwood Mac or Rumours... but this album isn't any worse than, say, Mirage... and it doesn't have the glossy eighties-ish sound that ruined Tango in the Night. The gems on the album are Vito/Burnette composition, ""When the Sun Goes Down,"" Stevie's ""Second Time"" and a composition by Nicks and Tom Petty guitarist Michael Cambell called ""Freedom."""
5,Excellent w/o Buckingham,"Even without Lindsey Buckingham,this is a great album. Billy Burnette has a great voice, and it shows in this CD. This should be a definite buy, just because LB isn't here, don't overlook it!"
3,Be still my soul,"This book is chiefly notable as the source of the lyrics for the beautiful hymn ""Be still my soul"" by K. von Schlegel, later set to music by Sibelius and widely admired."
4,Nice.,"It's nice..Very nice. Many pieces of songs composed by the famous Beethoven. My favorite happens to be ""Moonlight Sonata""."
4,"I'm not a sissy, darnit!!!!","Alfred Gingold is some sort of humorist, I suppose. In this book, parenthetically titled (The Manly Man in the Age of Sissification), he lampoons the Men's Movement. The two main treatises, Fire in the Belly and Iron John, are here eviscerated, mocked, and otherwise brutalized.An enlightened man like me felt really hurt, and shamed by Mr. Gingold's easy manner and brutish denial of his inner-most feelings. He ridicules the notion that erectile dysfunction may be caused by a disconnection to my, or one's, inner Warrior.Still, if I allowed myself to let go of my shame and fear, and embraced my inner Trickster, the book might actually be funny. But that would take so much work!(Does anyone have a hanky?)"
5,Very funny book,"I picked this book by chance in a yard sale, while on vacation. Practically every page I looked at had stuff that made me laugh out loud. After reading it from cover to cover -- it's perfect vacation reading -- I am pleased to report that this book is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS."
2,Fire in the John,"This parody of Iron John is an almost perfect mirror image of its target. It's funny, it made me laugh. You need to have at least tried to read Iron John to get a lot of the jokes. Like most parodies the joke wears a bit thin after 157 pages.I suspect that this book will appeal most to men like me who didn't have the patience (and/or learning) to finish Iron John.Still, Iron John had the last laugh. He's still in print unlike Fire in the John."
5,Great Documentary on Len Bias,"Reading the other reviews, everyone is writing about what a tremendous loss the death of Len Bias was (which, of course, it was). No one has mentioned what a wonderful documentary this is. The film has basically two parts: 1) Len Bias' history / events leading up to his death, and 2) the aftermath of his death. This film is very detailed in terms of who was with Bias and what they were doing the night he died. Many people are interviewed for this documentary, including friends and family to get a complete understanding of what went on before and after he died. You will not be sorry if you buy this DVD."
5,Still heartbreaking 20 years later.,"I bought this video after watching it on ESPN so that I could show an 8th grade Social Skills class that I teach. It was very appropriate to that age group, showing the dangers of drugs but especially how ones actions can have a lasting and sometimes damaging effect on those that we love. Growing up and living in the Washington, Maryland area I was surprised to find that not one 8th grader had ever heard of Len Bias. Hopefully by watching this and discussing the mistakes that he made, his death will not be in vain."
5,One great chapter of an outstanding ESPN collection,"As a celtic fan I've been always interested in Bias story, the documental is no about sports, but who Bias was and what he meant to fans, players and family. His death brought consciusness on how athletes interacted with drugs in the 80's and the possible consecuences for doing that.ESPN compiled great footage (see also the extras fetures with extended interviews) really worth buying.Running Time:51 minBonus Features:1) Director's statement2) 4 Interview extras3) Deleted scene4) Outside the Lines feature (OTL is an ESPN program)5) Univ. of Maryland & Lincoln theater premieres"
3,Great DVD Weak Movie,"I rented this movie with zero expectations. I didn't think I was going to like it, love it, or hate it. I came out somewhere in the middle. Upon entering the DVD in the player I found it to be one of the most thought out, and fun menus I have ever seen. I browsed through the menus, and watched a couple of the featurettes, and got really excited about the movie. I should not have gotten my hopes up. The first one, which I am not fond of, was way better. This one seemed(I hope so at least) to try and be campy. It failed. It played out like a made for T.V., Sci Fi Channel flick. Pointless scenes of the Creeper looking into the camera and smiling, and teenagers that all of a sudden can see into the past. Poor story telling, and bad acting add up to ONE STAR. The other TWO STARS are for the excellent DVD, which I imagine was put together to make up for a sub-par movie."
3,JEEPERS CREEPERS 2,IDE GIVE IT A 3 IN A HALF. THIS ONE WAS OK. NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BUT STILL WORTH WATCVHING AT LEAST ONCE. NOT THAT CREEPY OR SCARY. MORE HUMOROUS. WHEN A BUS FULL OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS ANDCOACHES BRAKE DOWN THEY FIND OUT THAT THERE SLITE DELAY IS THE LEAST OF THERE WORRIES. SOMETHING OR SOMEONE IS HUNTINGTHEM DOWN ONE BY ONE. WHOWILL LIVE AND WHAT WILL BE LEFT OF THEM?
3,Scarier than the first,My roommate and I laughed through the first one. The sequel is scarier. You see more of the creeper and he has an attitude. His attitude is like Freddy Krugeur's. JC2 is a fun horror movie.
3,A decent movie but made me disappointed.,"I have never seen the first one, but after hearing that this was a really freaky movie and it will make you jump out of your seats, I was willing to pick it up considering very few movies will scare people nowadays.To be honest, I was disappointed. The movie is not scary at all. It's strange, but not scary. In fact, the movie is actually silly. Some of the parts are so outrageous that it makes raise one eyebrow. I dunno how this movie was dubbed as a great scary movie, instead, it was a great silly movie.I admit I did enjoy the film to a certain extent; but the absence of real horror was not there not one bit. The only scary part throughout the movie is the beginning scene. After that, it's all downhill."
3,The Creeper is back !,"Decent movie atleast better and more action in part 2 than one.In the sequel they get into the Creeper's character alittle more which is cool since we don't even know what he his exactly.I'm a big fan of the Creeper but not really the movies.But JC2 is better than the first in my eyes , but not worth buying if your not a fan of the Creeper."
3,Rehash!,"""Jeepers Creepers 2"" is an unnecessary sequel that just rehashes the plot of Part 1 - this time focusing on a group of teenagers who get stranded on a bus. Not much else goin on here folks...This reviewer liked the first ""Jeepers Creepers"" much better. It had better acting, plot, and character development going for it. The sequel is somewhat fun if your a big fan of the original movie- but ultimately lacks everything that made the first film a winner.With nothing new or exciting about ""Jeepers Creepers 2"", this can be viewed as an O.K. movie at best."
4,Loved it! Much better than the first one.,"The first JC, they made the ""thing"" much too ""mysterious"" and unbelieveable....I really, really enjoyed the sequel much more because they showed him up close and scarier, too."
2,"Not very good, but okay","If you hated the first, you will hate this. Its that simple. When I first saw the original Jeepers Creepers, I thought it was okay, saw it a second time, talk about boring. Same with this film.This movie had it's moments though. Like, the very cool first scene, and the battle between the creeper and the teens and old man and his son at like the last 30 minutes of the movie. The ""battle"" was pretty cool, but after seeing it a second time, it's pretty darn boring.I will buy this when it comes to dvd, ONLY, and I mean ONLY because I have this huge horror dvd collection, and I have the first one anyways, so... get it when it comes out to see if you like it or not, it's worth a try anyways.?"
1,it is crap!,"Jeepers creepers 2 is one of the worst sequels i have seen in years, the first one is alot better, stick with that one.Jeepers creepers 2 is not worth one bit of money >:|"
2,Bad Sequel......,"After seeing Jeepers Creepers 1, I bought this movie without renting it first. Bad mistake. I wish I would have rented it first and not spent the money to buy it. This version of Jeepers Creepers centers around a group of students who's bus breaks down, naturally on the side of an isolated, deserted road. The ""creeper"" is back and the students are his new victims. Taking place mostly in a school bus, this movie has poor acting and a silly plot with the ""creeper"" purposly selecting certain students to kill. You get tired of seeing the ""creeper"" flying around like a huge bat and look forward to the ending. With the ending of the first Jeepers Creepers, you are left expecting a sequel but this one fails to deliver and is a true let down. This movie should have had a different writer or they just should have stopped at the first one!"
4,Winged Scarecrow of Doom,"Wow. Here's something a little different. Every 23 SPrings this thing comes alive and eats for a day. What does it eat? Oh the usual, kids, teenagers, and adults. It starts off with a farm kid getting snatched from the corn field leaving behind his older brother and father who can't belive wht they witnessed.The main story revolves around a high school basketball team on a bus. The Creeper has homemade throwing stars (made from human parts of course) to flatten the tires. He then snatches them up one by one for feeding time. The kids try their best to defeat him with a javelin and a flaregun.But the farmer returns with a homemade, gas powered harpoon. After some fighting and struggling he thinks he defeats the Creeper, but he's only sleeping.We exit 23 years later with the farmer ready to face him again. The Creeper hangs from his barn ceiling and you can see it for ""Five bucks a gander.""Not the greatest horror movie of all time, but better than average."
3,Jeepers Creepers 2 vs. Freddy vs.Jason,"Although Jeepers Creepers 2 is slightly inferior to the original as far as storyline is concerned, it is imbued with a terrific sense of atmosphere and dread. A testimony to the fact that, as a film maker, Victor Salva KNOWS what he is doing. He has yet again crafted an excellent and chilling urban legend set in backwater America, utilizing shock value and some pretty good visual effects to great advantage. To the people who say that director Ronny Yu's Freddy vs. Jason was better than this film I say two words...TASTE RE-EVALUATION! Freddy vs. Jason was, quite frankly, the product of a self indulgent hack who wouldn't know horror if it came up and stabbed him in his oriental ass. After gracing our screens for more than 20 years collectively, I think it's safe to say that Freddy and Jason's time is OVER. Let's have something new. Let's make way for the Creeper."
1,Jeepers Creepers...this movie sucks,"crummy sequel to the major 2001 original horror hit now has the creepster, played by Jonathan Breck (who played the creepster in the first one) praying on a bus load of students abandoned on a countryside road on a bus. will they survive the onslaught of the creepsters phlight as he must collect more bodies or will some guy, played by Ray Wise (The Chase, Twin Peaks: Fire, Walk With Me), defeat the creepster and put an end to his dasteredly deeds? non-sense of a sequel, should of been fun but in this case it suffers from a awfully dumb plot line and too much boring and excruciating characters, preferably teenagers getting killed again. the action and horror set pieces are laughable. goes in dead and comes out deadening...save your time and place"
1,the movie sucked,the second jeepers creepers had nothing to do with the first it left me with unanswered questions like what happened to the girl in the first one? the second jeepers creepers sucked big time i suggest no one even buy the the first or second becaues they are nothing alike i liked the first one but then i saw the second one it confused me alot
1,"Sniff, something stinks. Oh! It's the Movie. My bad.","I went to go see this movie with my girl at the drive-inn. Now, I'm not sure if it was the fact that it was the drive-inn that made this movie ... so badly (sound, visuals), but something was wrong. I couldn't get into the movie at all. My girl thought it was scary and stupid. I just thought it was stupid. I had so much faith in this movie however, that this would be a great horror flick, and it failed on so many levels. I thought it would have been forgotten. To my surprise, they are making another one. I guess hollywood can do anything they want nowadays. But if these morons can get film studios to give them millions of dollars to produce a film like that, shoot, they should give me half and I can produce a film that will turn a profit too. Can anyone say ""Blair Witch 3:Toil and Trouble"". I'm sure someone would be itching to see what I could come up with yet again."
5,"""Even Better Than The First""","""Jeepers Creepers 2"" made over $63,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice, more than the first. This time The Creeper wreaks havoc and terror on a bunch of basketball players, their cheerleaders, and coaches when their bus breaks down on an old highway. The film is terrifying, suspenseful, and shocking- everything a horror movie should be. Producers have stated a Part 3 and 4 are in post-production and Victor Salva will be on board again as the writer and director. The Creeper is one of the greatest villins/evil creatures I have ever seen on film so don't watch the movie alone if you scare easily. The single disc comes with audio commentary, deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, the trailer, and more."
1,Dull... Just Dull,"I love horror movies, I just do. But this movie... I do not love. I was bored for most of it, and I had gone in to the theatre with the lowest of expectations, and even those could not be filled. The characters are... well they are the farthest thing from characters ever. They are cardboard cutouts being moved across the screen by ""actors"". There are a few interesting ""characters"" but Salva never focuses on them. Instead he brings in issues like racism and homophobia... and doesn't do a thing with them. The action is... well there is a lot but I was still ready to doze off during most of it, and then Salva just abandons a good portion of the cast, never tells you if a good portion of them live or die, and then... the movie ends with the possibility of another sequal. Will I see the sequal... no."
2,No more Jeepers Creepers please!,"It is a shame a sequel to the great Jeepers Creepers movie was made. Part 1 was exciting, creepy and mysterious simultaneously. In part 2 all these positive elements are gone.Furthermore all action is a complete rerun of the first movie.No more Jeepers Creepers please! (SARR)"
2,"Every 23rd spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat...","...and I wish it ate faster.It's day 23 and a bus full of tastey students are returning victorious from a championship game. It's the middle of no where. They're stranded. He's hungry. Who's shocked? Not me.One by one our winged little creature picks them off, the end. There! Now you know the entire plot and don't need to rent Jeepers Creepers II, the sequel to the original disappointment Jeepers Creepers.I think director Victor Salva, upon realizing the vast crapocity of the original movie, opted to repress its memory and thus explains why the sequel has little if nothing to do with the first. Hell, they even forgot entirely about the films namesake, that being that lovely little ditty of a song that has been covered by just about everyone (my personal favourite being a rendition by Siouxsie & the Banshees).And that's all I have to say."
2,Not as good as the first one.,"After watching this movie I was kind of disappointed. The first one is much scarier and the creeper is more mysterious which makes it a better movie. In the 2nd one they show more of the creeper and he definitely doesn't look realistic and I didn't even jump in my seat once. I would say own the first movie, and rent the 2nd one if you haven't seen it because it wasn't that great."
1,It should have been under the Comedy genre,"The first part was not at all scary, but it was fun watching with the kids at home because they thought that it was a bit scary and we laughed. But seeing this sequel (or prequel or whatever) really was the best part, even the kids at home started laughing out loud along with us!!Who put this movie in the Horror genre, it should clearly have been in the Comedy section. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is when the Creeper sticks its tongue out and teases the kids, DAMN it was funny, we all burst out laughing..... Recommended to watch it, surely fun.... hahahaa.....But for Heaven's sake, please don't make such a SICK MOVIE again."
2,Actually more pointless than the first one,"The first JC started out great, then plummeted downhill into a morass of cliche-ridden and just plain stupidity. The second also starts out well, but then quickly becomes even more cliche and stupid. The special effects are so-so, the creature is never really fully explained (not when it wakes and what it does, but what the hell it is and where it comes from), and the whole it's dead-it's not dead-it's dead (believe me, I'm giving nothing away)gets tiresome almost immediately. Save yout time."
1,Lousy Sequel,"This is another one of those films that should've never been made. At the end of ""Jeepers Creepers"" we see the creeper looking out through Derry's eye sockets, his eyes no longer being there. What an excellent ending, both shocking and suspensful. The opening of this film shows potential and I briefly changed my mind as to whether it should've been made. After the creeper grabs the little farm kid it plumments, badly. As soon as the bus appears and you hear that annoying sound of a school pep song in the air, you just know that this is going to be, yet another, teen exploitation film. Who wants to see the creeper relentlessly picking teens and their teachers off one by one, and a grief stricken father going all out for revenge? We've seen it all before in a much better fashion. As well as being very predictable and lame, the acting sucks. When are they gonna learn that some people just can't act? All I can say in closing is thank god i didn't use my money to rent this rotten egg."
2,Not a very good sequel,"All the places the first ""Jeepers Creepers"" succeded the 2nd Jeepers Creepers fails, First off what happended to the Creeper's truck, that's what gave off a creepy feeling about the first movie, the Creeper flies entirely to much, how come in the first movie he actually walked, and not in this one? They showed his face too much. And the teens just became annoying babbling and fighting through the whole movie that you could care less if they died i was actually rooting for the Creeper. Stay away from this bad sequel atleast rent it before buying."
3,"well...it wasn't awful, but...","Shall I begin by saying how wonderful and interesting the first of the Jeepers Creepers movies was/is.... I really enjoyed the multitude of scenes and connections between the people in the first movie. This sequel does not meet the great technique of the first. Many times in the second movie there are scenes that take FAR too long and besides that...the VAST majority of the scenes take place in/around the school bus. How exciting is it to watch an entire movie at a stopped bus? At least in Speed there was some motion... Anyway, it's not a terrible movie, the ending was rather comedic...rent it first...then make your own decision:-)"
2,"Not as good as the original, but it's okay.","I went into this movie with high expectations, but alas, it wasn't what I expected. Since the first one was so cleverly written and suspenseful, I figured this one would be the same. It had its moments, lemme tell you, but it just wasn't as good.Wait for the video."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!,"WHEN YOU START OUT WITH A REALLY STUPID HORROR FLICK, WHY MAKE A SEQUEL??? THIS MOVIE IS EVEN MORE LAME THAN IT'S PREDICESOR!!! NO PLOT! NO SUBSTANCE! AND ALOT OF STUPID TEENS!!!..."
2,Eh! What Can You Expect From The First - Another Flop!,"Eh this movie was fair i guess. Nothing worth watching a 2nd time I hated the first one with a passion so I wasnt really going into this one with a real positive outlook, sometimes movies suprise you like this. But again this one wsnt very good either but definatley better then the first one, that was nothing but a laugh fest. Sorry but watching stupid kids die a pretty painful death is usually pretty amusing to me. I think they could have made the ""Creeper"" a lil more scarier to look at. He totally lacked a scary look..but anyway Some people liked it i guess, i just guess im not one of the Creeper fans.."
3,Pleasantly brainless romp,"If you enjoy monster movies (especially B-movies) you'll probably get a kick out of Jeepers Creepers 2. I found the original Jeepers Creepers to be an exceptional horror film... right up until the psychic cat lady showed up. Then the movie degraded into a train wreck.Jeepers Creepers 2 improves upon the first. Basically, the Creeper cripples a school bus full of annoying high school athletes and picks them off one by one. You know this going into the movie, and there aren't any surprised. But hey, I paid $6 to watch high school horror movie stereotypes get eaten one by one, and darn it, I got what I paid for.It's a fun popcorn flick. It won't win any Oscars, of course, but it does redeem the Creeper as an enjoyable monster after the debacle of the first movie's terrible second half."
1,Total and utter garbage!,"After really enjoying the first, I knew I had to see the 2nd. Picks up were the previous film left off, but this go around the creeper encounters poor dialogue, and stupid kids, and well, it becomes your typical horror sequel. This is funny. Not scary at all. The first one was scary, but this, well the only thing offers is answers to some questions but doesn't answer all of them, you know what that meens. That's right another sequel."
2,lackluster sequel,"The first movie was incredible. This one, not so much. This movie would have done better to explore more of the Creeper's backstory so we could see how he came to be, but the story mainly focuses on a schoolbus full of teens and their attempts to stay alive when the Creeper sets his sights on them. Don't get me wrong, there's some fun action and thriller sequences, but when it comes to story and depth, this move is lacking."
4,Good thriller,"I don't watch too many horror flicks especially when there is too much gory scenes, I like suspense. This movie is a thriller, not too gory but what scared me the most was the Creeper. It really is a living nightmare. I actually have to turn away anytime it's face, with those eyes & teeth, are shown. Really freaks me out. But for some reason whenever it is on TV I always put it on."
3,Feeding time isn't over yet,"Now I get to watch this one after a while of not seeing it like in what feels like forever just like with the first movie. This movie I forgot that it took not long after the events of the first movie and the creeper, definately looks a little more creepier than that of the first Jeepers Creepers. Though most of the movie seems to be mostly on that of a school bus sometime after a football team had won the state championship. I'm not saying that's bad but it just seems that it's been done before with other movies I seen like 'Bear' or 'Cujo'. The story itself is a continuation of the first movie, but by the time that the movie ends, makes you wonder if it's truly over. Overall I give Jeepers Creepers 2, 3 stars out of 5."
4,MUCH BETTER SEQUEL THAN MOST !,Victor Salva's 'JEEPERS CREEPERS 2' is a much better sequel than most! We get a whole lot more of the Creeper in part 2 & plenty of obnoxious numb-skull kids wich intern privides us with a much bigger body-count which is always nice! It really is just as good as part 1 in its own way & the Creeper in my opinion has got to be one of the best horror villains to grace the screen since Freddy & this sequel really helps launch him into that catagory. I recommend this one to anybody who loves a good monster movie. I can't wait for part 3!
2,Thank goodness it's only every 23 years...,"Not what i was hoping for. The thing this movie was missing was likable characters, which the first one had. Some fantastic camera work once again for the first views of the Creeper (blury, in the background, just to one side). Really good work there! As sequals go it was ok, but i hope that it stays as the two, because if it gets any worse than this second one, it'll be ruined. Still enjoyable if you liked the first one. But rent it first. Enjoy"
2,2 stars for part 2,"I caught the original Jeepers Creepers on a premier movie channel late one night, and it scared the Holy Horse Feathers out of me... I LOVED IT! After that, I waited rather impatiently for part 2 to come along... needless to say, they should have waited for ""once every 23 years"" before they did the sequal. There was really no story line, it was a typical teen movie... ""HUG, KISS, GROPE, SCREAM, RUN, DIE. I think that pretty much sums up part 2 in 6 words. For the sake of movie goers everywhere, and man kind for that matter... wait 23 years before you bring out another!"
2,what happened?,"The first had a comic book,larger than life feel to it, this one was flat and was creepy in another way.(the bus load of half naked boys,lets all go to the bathroom in a circle creepy)The kids are all idiots and there are no good gore effects to be found.the effects should have been better since the first was a hit.Go watch the original instead."
4,"Stand aside Freddy Kruger,beat it Jason, the Creeper is here","Let's face it people, this is horror not Shakespeare. I thought this movie was scary and I love the Creeper. In this sequel he has gained a personality and a slightly slimier look. Although I do commend a previous reviewer for somehow gaining the knowledge that Salva is a convicted child molester, this same reviewer obviously does NOT know the cost of creating special effects,which are magnificent in this movie. You didn't think the Creeper could really fly did you?"
2,almost decent. almost!,"if this movie hadn't been made, it would have been great, because this movie just ruined it. People that are saying this movie is great are probably little kids who haven't ever seen a scary movie before and this was the first introduction. i don't recommend this movie at all unless you just have to see it. if its just a maybe rental, then don't waste your money (4 bucks for this... NO STINKING WAY!). Wait until it comes on HBO or something and then watch it. Seriously man, I knew from the get go that this wasn't going to be good, I wasted an hour and a half of my precious life on this! No, if you want to see a good scary movie watch ""Freddy vs. Jason"" (at least it has a good final battle scene at the end)!"
2,Better Than The Original,"In an obvious attempt to create a new horror icon, we now have the ""creeper"". If you saw the first film then you know it was typical teen horror crap.But quite to my suprise, the sequel had scary moments. It was also very stylishly filmed. I am sure credit went to Francis Ford Coppolla for such atmospheric photography.There were some genuine frights in this sequel as the creeper attacks a bus full of shirtless high school jocks (obvious marketing gratuity)..Even if you thought the first film was awful, give this one a chance, even if you just rent it, it is pretty fun!"
1,0 STARS: And I thought the first one was bad!!!,"The movie ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" is terrible. I could not wait for this movie to end. The movie is not scary...the creature looks like a flying piece of feces and the acting is horrible. There are no redeeming qualities for this movie. This creature is the biggest wuss I have ever laid eyes upon.All I would need to do to kill this wuss of a creature is to grab my 12 gauge shotgun and some dove shot and sit in a cornfield with some beers and just have a good ole time. I cannnot believe that anyone takes this movie seriously. However, the movie is very unintentionally funny though because it is so unbelievably pathetic. Some people actually call ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish."
1,What's wrong with you people?,"This movie is a horrible horror movie. In fact this is perhaps one of the best comedies of the year. Nothing in this movie makes sense. A truck is flipped and breaks apart, then in the next scene it's perfect. None of the plot is reaveled, I still don't know what the entire movie is about. Furthermore, it seems to me when you make a sequal, it needs to be somewhat related to the previous movie. I give this one star because it can't get any lower. This movie was great in theater though, everyone was yelling at the screen because it was that bad. We were all laughing because of the lack of any rational thought given by writers. Please explain how two bus doors can be jammed by taking off one screw. RENT THIS IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH ALL NIGHT AT AN ATROCIOUS MOVIE!!!"
3,The Usual Teenage Sitting Ducks,"A substantial helping of CGI adds dumb but fun visual thrills to JC2, but the psychological horror lacks the necessary seductive terror that keeps us riveted. Part of the problem is that too much is spelled out for us visually - on that score, JC1 did a better job, teasing its audience without giving its mystery away. JC2 gives us more predictable, albeit spectacular, thrills, but is married to a shamelessly generic, mechanical storyline: a group of photogenic teens stranded in a broken down bus on dark country road and guess what? Something wants to eat them. Like other horror franchises that follow a similar format, the question is who gets picked off next. Will you care? Not really, still, JC2 has its moments. The DVD has some nice extras, most notable, ""A Day in Hell, which follows the director through a tough day of shooting on the set."
3,Enjoyed it!,"Great scary movie, I don't think it was better then part one, I think it should had more people involved. At least let the bus make it to a small town. But it didn't and it still was rather scary. I felt sorry for the little boy that he grab off of the farm, the poor father almost lost his mind. Whatever the thing was that was eating people body parts got what he should had gotten in part one."
1,"JUNK! TERRIBLE, STUPID sequal","The original ""Jeepers creepers"" had one of the most exciting original openings of any recent horror film I had seen. The movie was innovative, original and very scary. This lame sequal is plain horrible. The opeining defines boredom and the film drags on and on and never even approaches the original film's genuine frightful feeling. The Creeper's freaky truck never makes an apperance, the sog that was tied nto he title and theme never is played and the Creeper siply flies around looking stupid and not scary. The entire movie revolves around a bunch of jocks on a bus, stranded on the road,which alone is beyond lame and boring. None of the characters are interesting, and I felt this was just a lame excuse for MGM to cash in on whatever money they coud gross off this as that studio has had very few hits recently. Don't waste your time with this mess like I did. On a scale of 1-10 I give this pile of junk a ZERO!"
1,This Movie SUCKED!!!,"From what I seen of the movie it was Horrable. I hope an Pray they don't release a third movie of the series. PLEASE, don't waste your money on this Piece of crap"
3,FAIRLY REASONABLE FOLLOW-UP,"Jeepers Creepers 2 is not nearly as good as the first, but it still has its moments.The make and feel of the suspense element is sparingly used throughout, still is worth watching."
4,Much better than expected,"I've gone back and forth on whether to even watch this movie. Some critics so trashed this movie, that I figured maybe the director was just cashing in on the success of the first effort (not uncommon in horror flicks -- just check out the terrible Ring 2 (no don't!)).Well, what an (un)pleasant surprise! Jeepers Creepers 2 got me going right from the get-go, with the spooky scarecrows and a boy, increasingly isolated, in a field in the middle of the day (beware of the noonday devil). But I'm not going to spoil it for you. Clearly, Salva has issues with boys -- that seem to be disturbingly playing themselves out on the screen. But like it or not this adds to the unease of both Jeepers movies. And unease is gold when it comes to horror. Oh, and Ray Wise is great in this. Not Ahab, but a vengeful father that strikes back, and that was something I needed as relief from the disturbing first film."
4,Very entertaining and intelligent sequel,"I am a very picky horror movie patron, and I have to say that all the negative reviews for this film astonish me. This is better than part 1! It is a well-directed, intelligent andgenuinely scary movie, with one of the most disturbing and original monsters I have ever seen. No, it's not a flawlessabsolutely excellent film, but few modern horror movies even come close to being this entertaining and fresh. Usually a movie staged around a busload of teenagers guarantees lame, predictable dialog and stupid little romantic sub-plots. But this one rises to the occasion and it shines out as one of the best sequels in the horror genre. Rent it!"
2,Nothing to write home about,"Ehh it was ok and fun to watch, though not as original or well executed as the original. Nice collection of jock & cheerleader hotties, but the monster concept played its way out in the first film."
4,One of the better ones...,"I agree with all the above comments. I have been looking for a decent clock radio at a fair price and this unit wins. The sound is quite good for such small speakers and it is nice to wake up to whatever CD track you want. It also has a very sold feel to it, not too heavy, but it won't fall off the nightstand too easily either.There is the one downside, which can bother some, there is no dimmer switch and the green numbers are bright. That may not bother some and you can turn it away from the bed. It's too bad, I would have given this unit five stars otherwise."
2,Too disturbing,"Part 1 was about in sync with the Saw movies, then part 2 came out & that movie really wasn't that great. Now with part 3, this one is much worse than the Saw movies, and too disturbing for me. I'm not really sure about all the violence & gore, yet this movie might be suitable for some people, it was not a hit with me. Beware if you have a sensitive stomach!"
1,The Hangover Meets Hostel,"Hostel 3 had a good idea-have the club from the first few films bet on people's lives. It was only shown three times while the rest of movie just dragged on with boring characters who drank, gambled, & try to get laid. I wouldn't even recommend this film to fans of the first two movies or horror in general. This movie just sucks, plain and simple."
2,Why do the 3rd sequals always suck?,"I loved Hostel and Hostel 2, this doesn't hold a candle to either, if it wasn't called Hostel you wouldn't even know it was part of the same series. I don't think any one involved with the first 2 was involved in the production of this drivel. The whole thing takes place in one room with an audience watching and paying for different kinds of tortures to be performed on the victims, there's practically no story line or character development, it looks like it was shot with a digital camcorder, some of the gore is ok, but this doesn't have any replay value for me, it's a shame what happens to horror sequels when they hit unlucky #3 almost every time."
1,A movie that will kill you out of boredom.,"Bum, Boobs and Breasts added with Blood, Brutality and Bitches is no replacement to a terrible script, horrible acting skills and an absolutely mindless story-line. I wish someone would have told director Scott Speigel (Evil Dead 2 & The Quick and the Dead) this truth. Overall, a absolutely brain dead time wasting release. Save yourself some pain - Give this movie to your enemy.Overall rating - 1 out 10 (out of charity)"
4,DO YOU LIKE FREAKY?,"I enjoyed this sequel better than the second installment, although not nearly as good as the first one. The action now goes to Vegas with a bachelor party of four guys. The franchise has come to America. The movie consists of basically the same stuff, torture, killing, and scantily clad/ nude girls. What makes this one different is the excessive amount of twists the story takes. It constantly leads you in one direction and BAM! Did not see that coming.If you like your snuff films with pretty women serving drinks, wagering and a few twists, this is it.Hey I just got a great idea for Hangover III.F-bomb, nudity."
1,H o r r o r i b l e !!!!,In my opinion (and maybe a few others) this movie was dumb and waste of time. The biggest upset for me is I can't get my time back...lol
1,Hostel 3 very lame,I love the gritty feel of the first two movies. This movie was way too septic and clean. A bunch of wimpy rich people set at a table with a computer terminals and bid on how the torturer victimizes his victim. They don't even have the nerve to do it them selves. This movie was terrible. Unless Eli Roth comes back please let this be the last one.
1,Just couldn't get into it,"While I thought the first Hostel was an interesting story, by 4th installment I'm like what the heck? This is too much gore and too violent to enjoy."
2,HOSTEL part 3(hopefully the end of the series),"if there was ever a law in hollywood that should be enforced is labeling movies with a previous title. HOSTEL and HOSTEL part 2 are instant dark cult classics that brings the meaning of fear and asks oneself can this really happen?HOSTEL part 3(i have to call it that...) starts off like a ripoff of the hangover throws a BHC symbol and there you go!! The movie doesnt develop. The characters are weak, and the ending was so-so but it doesnt hit the point,If you a have a buck to spend at redbox and liked the other two. go ahead and rent it. its worth a buckIf Eli Roth doesnt do anything with the series, LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!"
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"It took three films, but finally the new Hostel film initiated a marketable franchise. The first two films were about a bunch of travelers who got kidnapped and killed by millionaires, who were part of some human hunting club, but they didn't go any further than that. Finally, in Hostel III, we see inside the elite hunting club and learn it's purpose. Also unlike the first two films, this Hostel has a plot, that's interesting and apathetic. Featured in Hostel III is Kip Pardue, a veteran b-movie actor, and newcomer Brian Hallisay. They were humorous, likeable, and perfect for this type of film. After two insane gorefests, Hostel finally grew up and learned to combine the shocking violence with a good story, and a likeable cast. This was the by far the best Hostel film so far and one of the best horror movies I've seen all year. If you like horror, don't miss this one. Even if you didn't like the first two films, give this one a shot!"
4,Good cheesy stuff!,"If you like the premise of the movies and have enjoyed the series so far, you'll probably find one or two things to smile about in this installment as well. It's not the best film I've seen, but there were a few pleasant surprises which made it worth the viewing."
1,A MOVE MADE BY PSYCHOPATHS - FOR PSYCHOPATHS,"When did horror movies become movies where people just get tortured slowly? When did seeing people get tortured slowly become entertainment? Why is it okay for a movie like this to be made?This is a movie made by psychopaths - I mean that literally. The people responsible for making this movie are losers, people who contribute nothing to society except to make this world a worse place to live. I find it disgusting that movies like this exist, and that there are people entertained by movies like this. This isn't meant to be a joke or to be facetious - if you like this movie, do the world a favor and kill yourself. I am absolutely not kidding about that. This is a movie made by psychopaths - for psychopaths, and if you like this movie - there's no room in the world for loser scum like you."
3,Set your expectations accordingly,"Hostel III is not as good as Hostel II, which was not as good as the original Hostel. Knowing this was a direct-to-DVD sequel, and having read reviews beforehand, my expectations were not very high. I wanted a decent story with adequate acting and special effects that weren't terribly cheap-looking. It met these qualifications, and I enjoyed it enough to give it three stars.The film takes quite a while to get going - more than 30 minutes - after a series of fake-outs and false starts. That wasn't a bad thing, and I was genuinely surprised a couple of times. The plot is more than a little influenced by ""The Hangover,"" with a dose of ""Taken."" The gore is minimal, likely due to the cheap budget, and there are no real scares. There was one twist that worked OK, but the final twist was very predictable.Hostel III is currently available for streaming on Netflix. I'd recommend watching it there rather than purchasing the DVD."
2,"Not that bad, but not that good","I bought this thing just to have the complete series. It's not a bad movie, but is poorly paced and edited. The best scenes are at the beginning and the ending is idiotic. Also, what happened to Anka? Please, give me stuff that has at least some logic in it.Still, they didn't manage to kill the franchise and I will wait for another sequel hoping for the best."
3,Hostel 3,"I was a little skeptic about watching this because of all the negative reviews. But I actually liked this movie. It was different from the first two. It could of been much worse. Go watch it for yourself, and don't listen to the negative reviews until you seen it."
3,Hostel is a satisfying horror flik.. but it lacks something..,"I am a tried and true horror fan from waay back. I adored Hostel 1 & 2 but this..Hmmm..It was not a suck fest, but it lacked that special something that made it's predecessors truly kick ass. They snuck into your brain and scared you to the core. Made you gasp. They were not cheez-oid slasher fliks but very real and very raw and very possible!I say don't dismiss but don't expect the same intensity and rawness of the other 2."
3,"Pretty good movie, worth watching","I didn't understand the hate. This kept me watching, and any movie that does that is worth my money. Some people are just snotty about everything they watch. Seriously."
3,predictable,watched this movie cause i am a big fan of the first hostel...scared me silly...should have known the sequels to follow could not hold up to the original however..a few suprises that i didn't see coming kept me interested..especially the end..so that was a plus..thus the 3 stars...
2,BY far the Worst out of the Series .,I am not sure if we were all watching the same movie. The Cinematography is abysmal and the acting is laughable. The kills are insipid and very cost effective. I really saw minimum gore in this film to say the least. And when you find out that the subject mater revolves around a woman it just kills it. Its reguarding a person that is barely in the film. Its quite obvious this was on a smaller budget or lack there of.I just feel like Eli Roth visually is a better director and cinematographer. This movie appears to be divided into two chunks and when you get down to the last chunk it loses momentum. The actions sequences are insipid and the explosions look CGI'ed. Watch this only if you are bored.
3,If you like Hostel you will find this movie entertaining,The movie is okay. Not the best in the series but still something to watch. I wouldn't watch it if you didn't like the first two.
1,Not thrilled,"well since I have never bought a used item I am disappointed that the detail was missing, like this product does not work with the new mac systemthat would have been helpful. I wasted $200.00 on a product that I can not use. I can not return it and again maybe my fault for not reading more aboutreturns but I assumed because i was buying via amazon that i would not have to be concerned with that. So not happy at all."
5,Pure Solid Git Down Low Down Funky Blues,"This album, to me, is the essence of the blues. It has all the elements and contains the type of up tempo blues that makes you want to git up and dance. I play drums and this is my absolute favorite album to play along to albeit coming close to Electric Funk. It's basic blues played by two solid blues musicians.I saw the group years ago in Delaware at an outdoors blues festival sponsored by a winery. After two or three sets half the audience was up dancing. It was a ball! I wonder where they are now?jack@udel.edu"
3,"Not exactly a ""lightning"" read","See my review of Messenger's ""The Blitzkrieg Story"" on amazon.com. I believe it's essentially the same book as ""The Art of Blitzkrieg."""
4,Sprouting adds to your life,"Found this book through Carla Emery's Encyclopedia of Country Living (highly reccomend this one also). Lots of information, easy read. Vitamin information available (what sprout provides what) and photos."
1,Not as Described,This product was described to fit the Fellowes Powershred 320cc - but they don't. I had to retrun them. Double check with Fellowes before ordering bags to make sure you are ordering the right ones.
5,BIGGEST yet,This is the 1st bag that was big enough for this mammoth shredded. I love it. I can shredd all afternoon and not have to empty it. Totally happy.
1,bad acting,I couldnt stop laughing at such god awful acting....It was so horrible the Hardcore Match in the so called junkyard was worth watching for a laugh..Id buy the tape or dvd just for the laugh..
3,Good ppv with some weak spots,I thought that this ppv was pretty good. I really liked the junkyard/hardcore match with like 20 people in it. I also liked the tag team title match between the triad and benoit & saturn. The main event was pretty good. Pretty good tape.
4,Good enough,Most of the matches were well done with the exception being the TV Title Match.The World title match was unique becauseNash could lose the belt to Anyone including his partner.The Tag Team Title match was good as well.Disco/Cat was great as well.
5,A Pinacle of Sorts,"This was the first David Gray album I owned, and I've come to regard it as perhaps his best. The standard rock and folk styles David Gray had been working with on the previous two albums are present here as well; in my opinion this is where they gel most sucessfully.If you've only heard White Ladder, be warned that Sell Selll Sell has none of its techno-tinged stylings. The first two songs are straight-ahead electric rockers, as are several others scattered further in the album. Overall it's a more musically upbeat album than the somewhat reserved White Ladder; it's also more musically cohesive than its two predecessors (though that's splitting hairs -- all four albums are terrific.)If you want to get just one of Mr. Gray's earlier albums, I'd recommend this one to start with."
5,Best David Gray Album!!!,"There is no other. Gutters in the rain alone is reason enough for anyone to own this. It's Gray at his best... lonely, depressed and lovably miserable. The song-writing is Gray's best."
2,Drowning David,"David Gray is the best the music sceen has heard since Van Morrisson. So, I'm not going to let him off easy on this one. While he does hit great notes with ""Hold on to Nothing,"" this album gave me nothing much else to hold on to [except ""Folk Song""].David Gray has a lot to sing. His best work, however, are those songs which we can hear his lyrics."
2,this album is horrificly overated,"... It is absolutely horrible. I really do not understand at all why people like it so much. The songs are annoying, unoriginal, and just plain boring. This is just extremely uncreative pop rock featuring a not too good band and annoying singing. Maybe you'll like this album, but just listen to it before buying."
2,Doesn't help much. Waiting for Pill Pro.,"I tried using this device hoping that it would help pilling a cat, but it doesn't do much. The real need is to have a piller that also introduces water to help the animal swallow and make sure it gets the full dose all the way into the belly. Put water in this thing and it will leak all over the place.There's a product coming out soon called the Pill Pro that will finally make pilling a dog or cat much simpler and better for the pet."
4,Great product.,I could not pill my cat no matter how hard I tried Untill now. this Pill gun realy helps. It works!
2,"Amusing, but unbelievable","There are a lot of funny parts to this book, for anyone who has been LDS for any length of time (if you're not LDS, it probably won't be funny at all). The humor is mostly of the sort where the protagonist makes many blunders and you (the reader) are glad that you, at least, aren't *that* clumsy. I found a lot of the people and conversations were so exaggerated as to not be realistic at all. While it's true that exaggeration can be a part of humor, it was just not believable to me at all that one person would make so many silly mistakes, and yet have such a perfect happy ending. There were some good things that the main character learned, which were more poignant due to the awkward circumstances she found herself in, though these insights are often talked about too much and demonstrated too little. It was a quick read, though, so if you want some light, funny reading and you find this book lying around, you might enjoy it."
2,Made my bike sluggish,"I purchased a pair of these and they lasted about 3 weeks. The tubes are very heavy - in my case, they caused my tires to rotate on the rim and valve stems got cut. My bike accelerated noticeably slower and my stopping distance increased significantly. I had much better luck with lighter tubes and liners."
4,Lovely music and recording,"I had never heard of Mondonville before hearing this recording, and am very glad I pursued it. My local classical radio station played the overture from this piece and I fell in love with it. If you can find a good price on it pick it up. I can't say I would pay $55.00 for it, but I'm sure it is very hard to find. The playing is great, as well as the singing. The recording is very good as well."
3,Never benn the Same,He Could of did better on the album the first two were great this one show he fell off should of used Marly Marl`s Super help on this even some help from some old juice crew buddy`s
4,Gift,This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She is a big Nina fan. She has a lot of her albums and CD's. She loves the boxed set.
3,Arthur's Pen Pal,This book is about a pen pal. Arthur thinks that his pen pal is a boy but it is a girl for real. I liked this book because it had really good pictures. I didn't like this book because it was too hard to read. I think kids should read this book.
2,"Good looking, but horribly fragile","I ordered this ring about three and a half months ago, and after wearing it nearly everyday, it recently broke literally in half (so now I have to ""C"" shaped pieces). I was taking it off, it fell on a hard surface from about two feet and cracked on the weld located directly opposite the snake ""head"" part. I was never excessively rough with the ring, so it had to be craftsmanship. Also noticed was that the silver plating had begun to come off rather quickly around the edges of the ring, and it turned black. The plating wearing off wasn't too bad looking but I was rather dissapionted when it broke in half in a situation were most rings would leave unscathed. I am giving it a two because it looks good and feels heavy, but is simply made to a standard not fit for everyday use. I would only recommend it to people looking to use it casually, once or twice a week. Otherwise, it will break, it is not a ring to wear everyday."
1,Ritual de lo Habitual (2 LP 180 Gram Vinyl),"I bought this 2 LP (180 gram vinyl set) hoping to discover new treasures within the music of Ritual de lo Habitual. However, the hack mix and mastering job on this 2 LP set is appallingly bad! It's uninspiringly flat; no life whatsoever!!! All of the nuance from the high-end portion of the mix is all but gone! What happened to the cymbals? The syllables from the vocals? The coiled wire of the bass strings? It sounds like an AM radio mix with some low end! Terrible. Don't buy this, stick with the CD."
5,Jane's Addiction - Saviors of early 90's music,"It's hard to believe that this album was released around the same time Kylie Minogue was topping the charts with ""Locomotion"". Ritual de lo Habitual sounds as fresh and innovative as ever. Perry Farrell's voice is amazing, and many of the slower songs on this album make full use of close harmony which gives the songs a great impact. This is the best album from the pioneers of what was once alt-rock. (although, ""alternative"" is now pretty much an idle genre; if Matchbox 20 are calling themselves alternative, then what's mainstream??)"
3,Good,"This proved to be the final Jane's Addiction album before their recent half-hearted comeback. Much of the album contains pretty good stuff, but doesn't cover new ground. Between the two, I prefer Nothing's Shocking."
4,realgoodalbum,"This is a great album, after listening you'll know where a lot of today's artists got their sound. It paved the way for almost all modern rock of the nineties and I doubt it'll stop influencing artists in this millenium."
2,not their best,"I have to disagree with the Amazon review that states this is ""by far their best album."" My friends and I were big fans of Nothing's Shocking, and their first eponomyous album from XXX records. I remember eagerly awaiting the release of this album. With the exception of Three Days, we were all disappointed.The songs seemed good for a listen or two, but nothing deeper. They seemed more created for catchy radio play than for anything else.While I can still enjoy Nothing's Shocking today, who doesn't change the radio station when you hear those stupid barking dogs from Been Caught Stealing?"
4,Nothing Shocking 2,"A good record. People don't understand that all of the songs on this record had been written before Nothing Shocking was ever released, except for the last two songs. I wish they written new material after the release date of the Nothing Shocking,it could have been great!!!"
5,"Oh baby, been caught listening!","It's the LP/ CD/ cassette to get if you dig Jane's.Many people would claim it as one of the best alt-albums of the 90s, and that's tough to dispute."
4,Three Days is a GREAT song,"The beginning amazon commentary is great except for it's criticism of the song 'Three Days' which is a great work. If you like the heavy, dark sound of songs like 'Coming down the mountian' you will probably find something to like in 'Three Days'. Although this song is slower then 'coming..."" it is a great example of the range of Jane's addiction. In short I am just adding my personal tidbit to say, this whole CD is great(....)"
4,Reacquaint Yourself with Janes Addiction,"With former members of Janes Addiction and Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea, rejoining forces for a reunion tour this summer, Ritual de lo Habitual is the perfect album to help listeners reacquaint themselves with the modern rock band that rocked air waves and music charts during the late 80s and early 90s. Ritual de lo Habitual is a well-rounded album that contains two of Janes Addiction's biggest hits, Stop! and Been Caught Stealing. Althought this album packs a punch that will appeal to any fan of high-energy rock n' roll it also contains songs like Three days that reveal the softer more reflective side of the band. Ritual de lo Habitual is a free-spirited album that would be the perfect sound track for a summer road trip or a backyard barbeque."
5,Intelligence! Brutally Realistic! Insightful!,"This is one of the best albums I have. Perry Farrell is one of the most extraordinary singer/songwriters walking the planet. He's one of those people that tells you things you never knew you knew. I appreciated his sadness at racism in ""No One's Leaving"" and his awareness at environmental issues with ""Stop!"" This album deals with revelations and perspectives on social ills and personal issues. That maniac who bashed ""Three Days"" and ""Then she did..."" didn't know what she was talking about. The latter is beautiful and one of my favorites, the orchestration is beautiful and the lyrics about his mother are touching. It's my favorite song besides ""Of Course"" which has an almost ironic violin intro and conveys the delerious feeling you get when you seem to have figured out the world"
5,period peice from early 90's!,"Look Ritual De La Habitual is a period peice, made during a the time of the Gulf War and economic recession it is reflextive of how people wanted to escape. It came out just before ""alternative"" music was popular and is a combination of suicidal tendencies, motley crue, and Slayer. Ritual is a very exciting record and is very energetic! Anyone who was a teenager in the late eightees or 90's as i was can appreciate Ritual!"
2,One of the Better 90s Pop Bands,"For some reason many people have love or hate thoughts toward Jane's Addiction vocals. I am not of the opinion that the vocals are bad. However, though there are a few hits this album, it lacks consistency. I can't say I care much for the songs that didn't chart on this album, and that leads me to believe that Jane's Addiction's popularity is more due to corporate promotion than anything else. Jane's Addiction was a part of the 90s rock revolution, and they are definitely among the better bands of this time. Their guitarist excellent. I am not going to say that they are not talented. However, I will remind you that the local jazz artist is making much less money, and is probably much better."
2,Spanish in Jane's Addiction Songs 101,"Ira Moon,The spanish spoken intro actually means ""We have more influence over your children than you do, but we love them. From Los Angeles, Jane's Addiction"", as it reads somewhere on the accompanying booklet."
4,Please....No More Been Caught Stealing,"Bottom line, I feel that Been Caught Stealing is one of the worst songs ever written by Jane's. Only song that comes close is Pets from Porno for Pyro's. I am sure that the excessive radio play has had something to do with it, but they are mindless drivel of blech. Stop is an epic song. Easiliy one of my all time fav's from any genre or band. No One's Leaving is great too. The rest of the album is ehhh, but the strength of the 1st two songs carries this album to 4 stars in my opinion.If you are just getting into Jane's, Nothing's Shocking is still the best of course.I will say one thing, if you are able to see Jane's live, they make even the ehhh songs on this album great. Maybe they were never meant to be good in studio."
2,DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE,"I love Nothings shocking. It is Perrys masterwork, this seems tiered to Me. If You want something that sounds like NS this is not it. I was very disappointed."
3,Unimpressed,"I bought this CD on the strength of the reviews, but find it to be nothing special at all. Basically, the lyrics, on which all the music hinges, are juvenile and amateurish. I expected real creativity like that found in nirvana, pearl jam, ratm, or the chili peppers, but this is nothing close."
1,I REALLY DONT GET IT...,"this album is a major dissapointment. If it wasnt for the solid drum work, it would be completely USELESS. perry ferrel voice is already irritating enough without the excess reverb used to try to make it bigger sounding. ""Three days"" is 23hrs and 55 minutes too long, ""been caught stealing"" gives me a rash and ""stop"" makes me want to jump out of a window. Im all for bands who arent afraid to take chances with their music- i just think that this was one experiment whose funding should have been abruptly cut short! In short- DONT BOTHER WITH THIS NONSENSE!"
5,30 Minute Acid Trip,"First introduction - Sonora Desert - 70 miles an hour - two great friends...blew my mind. Music cracked through the exoskeleton and set my mind and soul ablaze. Still has that same effect 15 years later...power, intensity, the crytal scalpel releasing the inner zen...one MUST eat the other, what bitter irony. If your worthy, this is some of the most challenging, intellectual-emotionally artistic music out there. It will create magnificant backdrops in the mind. Too much power contained within such a small grouping couldn't last. The sub nuclear assemblage went critical mass."
5,Absolutely Superb,"The finest ""alternative"" album of all time. A true classic that I couldn't live without."
5,Magnificent,"Well, what can I say that hasn't been said in the previous review? Only that this ranks as one of my top favorites of all time. Typically when I listen to the CD I usually start with Been Caught Stealing and let it go to the end. Three Days, which (I've heard) is based on Perry's weekend spent with his girlfriend, another girlfriend, and a lot of heroin. Navarro's solo I can only describe as sexual and multi-orgasmic. Then She Did is a wonderful tribute to an artist who died (""Now her paints are dry...""), and his mother; and Classic Girl is a sweet tribute to his girfriend, Casey. Critics have complained that these songs are overlong and too self-indulgent. My response to that is they either have short attention spans or are simply jealous."
3,Very informative. But not easy to follow.,If you are reading about Buddhism for the first time you may get a little lost in this book.
4,Melodious,Music is very melodious and very touching. The songs chosen are very apt. Good stuff and a good buy
4,No curve,"I'm a teenager who loves to read the BRI books while I am on the pot. I have like 5 and read through all of them (I just started this one). Right off the bat I realized that the arch thingy (where the book bends) Doesn't bend as much as the opther ones, which makes it harder to read."
1,OK-At best-,"I had this 2 vol set for a cross sectional course- The pictures were poor quality, the labels ambiguous, and the author had a tendency to be inconsistent with viewing aspect- one image is a sup/inf view, and the very next one is exactly the opposite- and although recognizing the anatomy from different aspects is important, this book did so in such and random, disorganized manner. The orientation went against all of my training as a radiology and ct tech, since the image orientation was not consistent.(the right should ALWAYS be the right, doncha know?) I do not recommend it to imaging professionals, as there are better books out there, but it might be ok for medical students or the like. Overall, I began to despise this book to the point that I gave it away as soon as class was over, and I found myself using other texts and online resources to study, because the book was just too confusing!!"
1,Heaven Help You! If you are required to buy this for a class!,"This 2 volume set is horrible! The diagrams in the Applications book are vague and confusioning. The way that the Concepts book is written is just terrible it is jumbled and runs together. It is impossible to besure that you are labeling or even answering most of the questions correctly, let alone all of them. Diagrams in the workbook that are totally different then the ones in the Concepts book and you are suppose to label them? correctly? There has got to be something better out there. I can not wait until I am done with this class, I will see if everyone wants to come over to my book burning party!"
2,Received half the order as well!,"Someone else said they received half the other too... So did I! Fortunately, I received the Applications book which I needed for my homework, but I didn't get the Concepts part which I need to read for class! Dont advertise a 2 volume set if you're not going to send it!"
1,Only received half the order,Ordered the 2 book set as advertised and only received 1 book- no time to return because I needed it for school and received a yoga dvd instead of the other book- so basically paid twice as much for just one book
5,A great flatpicking sampler,"Though a few years old and therefore missing some of today's best players, this CD is a fine introduction to the art of flatpicking guitar. It is a shame most of these players aren't better known to the general public; they are incredible musicians."
5,intership 101 with Sidney Lumet,"I can only say how greatful I am to Mr. Sidney Lumet for taking the time to share his vast experience while gaining the tools to take a story and keep it flowing regardless to time, fears and woes. It is good to hear from a man that did the wiz and brought out the talents in actors that would other wise never reached the levels they are at today. I wish he would come out with another one and go on fro mthe latest works of his. God bless Mr. Sidney Lumet you are a god of the movie screen."
5,A good summary.,"You are just about to start filmschool?Get ahead and read this faboulus book about making movies.From the screenwriting process to the post work Lumet describes the making of a movie.A must read for future moviemakers, filmbuffs or people who wonder how a movie is made.Easy to read. Easy to understand."
2,"the correct title for this book is ""Directing Movies""","While it was a decent read, this book is not about making movies. It is about directing movies. The author is a director, and that is what he knows. Barely mentioned in this book are all the other players that go into making movies: producers, talent agencies, studios, financing, unions, actors contracts, distribution, marketing, etc."
5,Excellent! One of the best!,"Lumet's book is one of the best film books I've read. It explains all the technical terms, and has diagrams to accompany the text. It explains the process of making movies step by step, and shows the glamorous and not so glamorous parts of the industry. This books is definately for people who are interested in the art of filmmaking, for fun or for work."
4,Interesting insight from a directors point of view.,"Sidney Lumet holds nothing back. He is honest and interesting, but refrains from trashing anyone. Great insight into the enormous amount of work that goes into a movie and how seriously the players take their roles."
5,Great for thos studying film!,"This book was fantastic, and I recommend this to all ppl intersted in films, especially students. It really brings a reality check to it all and makes you love filmmaking even more! Just great!"
4,meaningfull experiences,This book talks mostly about a personal experience. But is a great shearing that can tell a lot about the making of a movie (no kidding). The last chapter is the best. I sure recomend it to any person intrested not just in movie making but in Movies in general.
4,A Good Film Study,"Making Movies is a very good book that any student filmmaker should read. It takes the entire process of making a film and analyzes it step by step. Lumet is a wonderful filmmaker who is a master of the craft; reading this book is like assisting to a lecture given by one of Hollywood's finest.Lumet takes every single film he has ever done and talks about them from every point of view possible; lighting, directing, acting, editing, sound, score... Every aspect of filmmaking is touched upon and explained in explicit details for the reader. Lumet leaves nothing out. Although he can at times seem a little pretentious, his writing is top-notch and his intelligence always welcomed. This book really gives you an idea of all the work that goes behind the making of a film and it is a book that any young filmmaker - or anyone who loves movies for that matter - should read."
3,Good insight,Liked it quite a bit. But what's the scoop between Lumet and the Teamsters ? He's pretty sour towards them and is not forthcoming on valid reasons beyond repeated snide remarks.Not that I care one way or the other anymore.Jimmy Hoffa
1,Bad,"Has issues. The screen keeps blanking out, the controls are messed up, trying to adjust anything (brightness, contrast etc) makes the monitor crash. (The on scree interface actually locks up!)Cheaply made."
2,"Envision 15"" LCD Flat panel","I recently purchased Envision 15"" LCD Flat panel. Big dissappointment! The back light of this monitor was completely off. On the top the screen was very dark and on the buttom too bright. There is no way to adjust the back light to evenly illuminate the screen. Sent it right back!WHAT YOU PAY IS WHAT YOU GET."
3,Brightness On The Screen Uneven,"This is my first Lcd monitor. The obvious weakness is that many of the times the bottom half of the screen is somewhat brighter than the top half, and this phenomenon is especially evident when I play board games like CHESS or GO. If you don't play board games on line, it maybe OK. But for me, I am thinking of returning it to Amazon for a CRT."
1,Lacks durability,I have had this monitor for seven months and the screen image has totally faded. I can't see even black words on the screen. I am having to ship the monitor to California at my own expense. I am very disappointed with this product.
5,Plug and play.,Great out of the box. Unplugged the old and plugged in the new. Asked my daughter to shut down the computer and she was back on line within 5 minutes. Excellent picture quality and of course more space.
5,Great buy - needs a little work to fine tune,"I've been using mine for about two weeks now. Looks great (although not as nice as the...digital flat panel it's next too)- some colors tend to be a little on the light side, but I would not even notice if I wasn't on a dual monitor system.The ""auto"" adjustment works OK, but I found that with some manual adjustment of the Focus, clock, and H.Position I can get better results - really crisp and clean. Spend a few minutes playing with these settings - if you don't like the results, you can always push the ""auto"" button!Update: It's been a few months now. Still like the monitor!"
5,Excellent image quality at a reasonable price,"The images coming out of this monitor are bright and sharp. It does a very good job in displaying crisp text. It is very easy to set up and no adjustment is needed. If you do want to adjust the monitor, all the switches are easily assessable. For those who are using older Mac, ie a G3-266, which do not have a standard VGA port, you need to use an adapter. Save the adapter for the original CRT monitor because it may be just the right one that you need."
4,"High Quality, Low Price","My wife and I bought an Envision 15"" monitor for her computer at Thanksgiving. Simple to hook up, no configuation hassles, and a really nice picture. And you can't beat the price. Only hassle: Original unit was DOA. Exchanged it, and the new one works like a champ. Now I'm looking for an Envision 17"" to replace my 19"" CRT. No hesitation recommending this monitor!"
1,"Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang, and the Nibelungen","What verbiage! Get to the point!I'm sorry; I read and re-read and still have no clear idea what the author is trying to say.The author could have saved much paper by writing one clearly stated sentence--and been done with it.If I see the word inflected one more time--well I already screamed.It does have some neat pictures from the Fritz Lang movie.And while I have seen the Verhoeven Nasty Girl movie (and liked it and found it quite interesting), it seems out of place to put its commentary in a book along side Wagner's Ring, Lang's movie and the book Das Nibelungenlied."
1,author's last name a spoiler in more ways than one,"A ""book"" about Wagner and Aryan legend by someone named Levin. No need to read it to know it. And the cycle goes on and on. The choice of a Nordic being killed on the cover proves that the author is an anti-Nordite!"
1,Misleading listing on Amazon,"I ordered two of these items, believing that they were the ""snowboards"" that my grandsons wanted. These so-called ""snowboards"" are little toys that a toddler or small child might enjoy using, but they are not the snowbaords that older children and adults use on the ski/snowboard slopes. Since I was not familiar with snowboards, I didn't realize that real snowboards sell for over $100 and more, I mistakingly ordered these toy items. And because I was unable to make the contact within 30 days of purhase to get a refund, I am out a good amount of money now that I apparently can't redeem.munn-fess@roadrunner.comParicon Sceptor Snowboard"
4,Snow Board,This is perfect for a first time snow boarder. My grandson is 5 and absolutely loves this snow board and the price is right.
3,Pretty flimsy,It is basically what you pay for. Flimsy plastic that will break fairly easily. For extreme beginners only. Took forever to get it here - two weeks after we were promised.
4,So far so good...,"I gave this as a present for a 15 year old, and she liked it very much and so farit has been used a few times and without any problems.I think it was at a very reasonable price too."
4,snow board,"Nice beginner snow board for small hills.I wish the straps snapped in, they tend to slide out, but they are easy to slide back in.I recommend it"
2,Snowboard,"There was no picture available prior to my purchase. I probably would not have purchased this knowing what the board looked like. It is very thin, and not the standard snow board you find on the slopes."
1,another bootleg anime t,licensed anime t shirts are professionally screenprinted. this is a heat transfer bootleg. you could copy the image and make this yourself if you were dishonest
5,Fantastic Blues Album,This band is incredible! Give this album listen if you enjoy some good hearty blues. Three piece band rocks it better than most five plus.
4,Rub adds excitement to meat dishes,"This rub is excellent for beef, lamb or pork. Perfect to rub in and then grill or bake meats. Adds interest and flavor to meat dishes."
3,Moonstruck CD,"I enjoyed this CD very much. There are many different styles of music contained in this CD. For a group that hasn't been around all that long, it shows the growth that they are trying to achieve through the music and trying to find a style that suits them. There are a few songs on the CD that are enchanting and deserve praise. Some of the songs are a bit ""off"", but all in all, the music is well done, the words are well done. Some of the songs that the mains singers sing together don't blend all that well with their voices, but I still think it is an enjoyable CD and would enjoy more music from this group. The quality of the CD is average, but in my opinion, the sound is fine and doesn't really get in the way of enjoying the music."
1,If only both singers could sing....,"This would be truly wonderful music if only both of the singers actually could. Sing, that is. The female manages to hit the right notes most of the time, but the guy---Eeee Gads!! This is what happens when the tone deaf decide to harmonize. The lyrics are cutesy fluff and not intolerable. This is a good bit of music for people new to the Craft, who tend to think anything even remotely Pagan is a good buy. And they do have a nice chant or two which, thankfully, the guy sings so softly he doesn't ruin it. Not a recommended tape for anyone with musical expertise, particularly in vocals, but ok if you just like witchy music for the sake of itself."
1,I was sorely disappointed,"I picked this up from the ""Bargain Bin"" at a south shore mystical shop while on vacation. The fact that is was in the bargain bin should have been my first clue. It was a promo CD that had been sent to the store and was re-sold ""as is"" with the packaging removed. I guess the store didn't want to keep it for their in-store music rotation. I purchased it dirt cheap and stuck it in my car stereo and was horrified by the cackling, sloppy vocals and subpar instrumentation. I do not recommend this CD for purchase."
5,Erma Bombeck,So sorry that she is gone. This book is highly recommended. She will brighten your day in every page you read.
4,Loved it.,"I loved the article about the disappearing underwear. It is so hilariously funny. I can also relate to the disappearing socks. This is a book you can pick up any time- have a laugh , and it certainly makes your day a bit brighter."
5,Why we loved Erma,Why we loved Erma and miss her is right here. She made you feel good about your mistakes. Suddenly being a fallen human made you feel superior to those who were too perfect to admit it!
3,WCW Great American Bash 1999 review,"The Brian Knobbs-Hak hardcore match was not great but pretty good. The Hammer-Mikey Whipwreck,Buff Bagwell-Disco Inferno, & the Ernest Miller-Horace Hogan matches were all just fillers. The bout between The No Limit Solders(Konnan & Rey Misterio Jr) against The West Texas Rednecks(Curt Henning & Bobby Duncum Jr) was pretty one-sided and mainly focusing on Rey & Curt too much. The Ric Flair-Roddy Piper match for full control of WCW while not a good match, it was still a entertaining at times. The Falls Count Anywhere match between Rick Steiner & Sting was a solid brawl with a scary ending to boot. The world tag team title match between The Jeresy Triad(DDP & Kanyon) & the team of Chris Beniot & Perry Saturn was pretty solid for a tag bout. The Kevin Nash-Randy Savage world title match was a pretty good brawl ruined by a DQ ending. I give this event a 6 out of 10."
5,great american bash is great,1st match brian knobs vs hardcore hak winner hardcore hak. 2nd match mickey whipwreck vs van hammer winner van hammer. 3rd match disco inferno vs buff bagwell winner buff bagwell. 4th match curt hening and bobby duncan jr vs rey mystiro jr and konnan winners rey mystiro jr and konnan. 5th match the cat vs scott norton winner the cat. 6th match ric flair vs roddy piper winner ric flair. 7th match sting vs rick stiner sting gets attacked by rabid dogs winner rick stiner. 8th match ddp and kayon vs saturn and chris benoit winners ddp and kayon 9th match kevin nash vs macho man randy savage winner kevin nash. this pay per view is great.
3,Good ppv but has some weak spots,"I thought the ppv was pretty good.Sting vs. Rick Steiner was good but ended kind of stupid. The tag team title match was awesome with Saturn & Benoit vs. New Jersey Triad. I thought the three stupidest matches of the night was Mikey Whipwreck vs. Van Hammer, The Cat vs. Horace, Buff Bagwell vs. Disco Inferno. Loved the return of Sid in the title match, AWESOME! Hak vs. Knobbs was a pretty good match as well. Pretty good pay per view but I have seen better."
1,Worst GAB EVER!,"Ths was without a doubt the worst Great American Bash ever.No US title match,No TV title match and NO Cruiserweight Title Match.NO Hogan,No Hart,No Goldberg and a disqualification in the world title main event.Bottom line it really sucked."
4,Lynne at it again!,Thiscd is just like anything ELO did but more thought out. Jeff Lynne is a melody freak! All of these songs are sing alongs. Ilove the 1st and 3rd songs but the best might be number 4. get this its a cd the whole family will love!!!!.
1,dont have it where is it,be nice to have it so i can rate it can you tell where it is hope soon is it lost
2,Where's the beef?,"If you're an ELO or Jeff Lynne fan, you may love this. I admit I'm not one.If, like me, you came here by way of having enjoyed the Traveling Wilburys and/or the Lynne-produced Petty or Harrison CD's that came out at the same time, you may be disappointed. The sound is similar, the songs are of course perfect in melody and production, and that same relaxed fun feel can be found here.But I just didn't find these songs interesting. They're fun but they're fluff. Without the great singing or songwriting of a Dylan or Petty or Harrison or Orbison, the fun didn't survive a second or third listening for me, and I put this CD away in 1990."
5,Sounds better than ever,"This one has improved with age, as everything Jeff Lynne has ever written. The Wilbury influence is there for sure, specially because George Harrison made contributions in 4 tracks and Tom Petty co-wrote the excellent ""Blown Away"". The wonderful ELO sound is also present and perfectly blended with the recently acquired influences.""Armchair Theatre"" could be considered as an introduction to the future sound of ELO. ""Zoom"" (2001) is even better, but in order to enjoy it, you probably need to listen to ""Armchair Theater"" first. You will find some of Jeff Lynne's best compositions here: ""Every Little Thing"", ""Lift Me Up"", ""Don't Say Goodbye"" and my personal favorite ""Blown Away"", which is probably the best Petty/Lynne colaboration ever.This one is a must for all ELO fans and a revelation for the non-converted."
5,Amazing,"This paste is wonderful in so many different foods. I combine it with lemon and rub it on a roast chicken or baked cut up chicken or on a thanksgiving turkey. I combine it with chipotle peppers with some adobo sauce and spread it on thinly sliced pork for a few hours then grill it for tacos al pastor along with grilled thinly sliced red onions and sliced grilled pineapple. I use it as part of the seasonings for the chicken that goes in tamales. I use it for about a dozen other recipes. This stuff is amazing and brings life to so many dishes.This spice blend originates in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (according to my Mom) and is widely used in Mexican cooking. It was originally a Mayan condiment but has spread in use. It consists of Annatto seed along with a number of other spices. It is commonly also called Recado Rojo.Once opened, I store the leftover paste in the refrigerator for best results. That keeps it tasting fresh and helps keep it from drying out."
3,Suunto Bike Pod worked eventually,"The first POD I received would not synch up with the Suunto t4d device. So I returned it and Amazon sent me a new on that worked right away. I had some trouble getting installed on my mountain bike because it is supposed to be within 1 cm of the little magnet you install on the bike spoke. It took some trial and error, but I eventually got it working. I really like the Suunto t4d product."
1,"Horrible design, not worth it","The suunto bike pod is not worth it. The design is horrible and very difficult to attach to the front fork. Plus the quality is not good and the plastic that holds the bike pod in place breaks after 7 months (both of them) and you lose your bike pod.Plus the initial setup to get it working with the watch was difficult and counter intuitive, not very easy to set up. But once you get it working the information you get is good.Overall, hard to set up, the bad design makes attaching to the bike even more difficult, some what easy to use once installed, but the quality will only last a couple months. Would skip Suunto and go with an other brand. And the Suunto products are not compatible with the newer Macs."
5,Downtown Train,I had this compilation of Rod Stewart goodies on cassette when it was created back in the 90's and was thrilled to find it on CD on Amazon during my continued process of conversion. Great mix for any Rod fan!
2,Not enough camera-specific information,"I bought this book hoping it would be full of specificinformation on my Pentax ZX-M. Unfortunately, I found it consisted ofonly one chapter on my camera, one on the older K1000 (as advertised), and the rest general tips that you could read about in much more detail in a book like Grimm et al.'s Basic Book of Photography or Adams' series. I wanted information on lenses in the Pentax system, how my specific flash unit worked best, etc. Buy this book only if you're looking to complete your photo library and have extra $ you don't want to spend on film."
3,Nice guide for a novice Pentax owner,I bought this book hoping for information specific to my camera (ZX-M) with tips on photography in general. Spending a couple of hours on photo.net and reading a book by Lee Frost provided far more useful information than is contained in this book. The manual that came with the camera does a very good job educating the user on the various functions of the camera. There were some useful tips on using flash and understanding the metering system. If you are a complete novice this will be a very useful book for you. If you are a complete novice and have spent some time doing research before purchasing your camera this will not be as useful. If you are an experienced amateur this book will be of very little use.
3,good book; poor ebook,"the book itself is a fantastic read. however, this ebook was clearly made with OCR software and is challenging to read because of the constant barage of formating errors and misreads by the software. only a dollar though so a good deal."
4,Very good bluegrass for very little money,"This is really a fun bluegrass album from a great bluegrass band. Although its not the most creative work done by artists like Tony Rice and J.D. Crowe, it's still a great example of what the famous Bluegrass Album Band can do."
4,Great relaxation music,"My old boss had this CD at work and would often loan it to me to play at my desk. It made the day go by faster and eased some of the usual stress caused by work. I recently bought my own copy, which I play at home during parties. Everyone loves it. Apparently, it is out of print, which is a pity. If you have a chance to get this - and if you enjoy relaxing South American music - buy it at once!"
5,APURIMAC ~ CUSCO,As a great fan of CUSCO I have most of his music and have just added his three APURIMAC CD's to my collection. I enjoy many different kinds of music but seem to have Cusco on every day more and more. His lovely sounds are so happy and uplifting...a person just can't stay in a bad mood.
3,"Entertaining, but without soul","The music is lively and engaging, but it lacks grandeur. The track ""Andes"" is actually silly, something you might hear on a child's program. By contrast, Apurimac III is much better."
2,"This is ""authentic?""","While I can agree with other reviewer's comments about the flow of the music, it seems to lack the tribal feel that I would have expected from anything claiming to be authentic Peruvian or Andean. Where are the native percussive sounds? It sounds pretty, but not sure it's really true enough to form to be anything more than good marketting using the mystery of the unknown as a selling feature.This said, the Apurimac III does a much better job IMO."
5,Simply Beautiful!!,"Apurimac is Cusco's debut album in the U.S., and it doesn't disappoint. The music is inspiring, and breathtaking. The Peruvian flutes, drums, and other instruments all provide an enchanting experience. This is a CD I will enjoy forever, and will never tire of. Many of the songs have fast tempos, while others are slower and more peaceful, and there are absolutely no lyrics to any of the songs, just beautiful instruments. Overall there should be a song for everyone on this CD. Some songs worthy of mention are Apurimac, Inca Dance, and Fighting Inca. This CD is a treasure, as are all other Cusco CDs. It is too bad CDs like this are so rare to find! If you enjoy this CD, and are looking for more, try Apurimac 2 and 3, and also Ring of the Dolphin. All of these CDs are wonderful too."
4,Wonderful!,"I just received this doll for Christmas, and I'm very pleased. She is very petty and I love her outfits. Both the black prom dress and the blue party dress are stunning and trendy, and any girl would be happy to get this doll as a present... but I would not reccomend it for young or eager children, as she has lots of (very tiny) makeup and accessories. Her hair also has a tendancy to come out a little if you're not careful. However, this would still be a wonderful doll to give to an older or slightly more mature girl."
2,Funky look,"I think that this Bratz doll out of all of the other skiny weird bodied dolls is very unpleasing. I thought about buying this doll and this is why I didn't: She not only looks like a witch in her fluffed black dress but her shoes are a diffrent colorthan her legs.Her hair has no style,is very scraggly and falls out! Unlike Barbie from the My Scene group, Barbie's hair always has some style with curls or pretty straight hair. She looks tacky! Her dress is so tiny! She has such a big head and such a small body. My Scene did not copy those Bratz. Who wants to be called a brat any way?Then they have the nerve to throw in a halo on their big heads!For $34.99, she stinks. My Scene's are $24.99 for two dolls in the Night on the Town dolls .They are more hip and they are way taller. I do not recomend Chloe doll to anyone ."
1,I don't get it,"Why on earth do toy manufacturers think it's appropriate to make a doll who looks like she has had collagen injected into her lips? From the heavy make-up down to the clothing that looks like it belongs on a lady of the evening, these dolls are a detriment to the self-image of girls."
5,no-ads sunblock,"Can't fault this product. Purchased from the states as it's the only suncream that does not irritate my husband's very sensitive skin. Soaks in immediately, non-greasy, non-perfumed. Delivered very quickly."
3,"Not quite as good as /Speed Graphic/, but still strong.","/Sunny 16/ is definitely not without its charm. It's best when Folds is doing his usual sunny and sarcastic pop, as in ""All U Can Eat"" and ""There's Always Someone Cooler Than You."" The lovely closer, ""Songs of Love,"" is another highlight, swaying along on a waltz beat as the piano and strings dance. The other two tracks, ""Learn to Live with What You Are"" and ""Rock Star,"" essentially sound the same: nondescript mid-tempo pop tracks that neither inspire nor offend. They're not bad, per se, but I doubt they'd make the cut on an actual Folds album. They do bring the experience down, though, which is a shame given the quality of the rest of the material. Pick up /Speed Graphic/ if you want to hear Folds at his finest in this EP collection, but /Sunny 16/ is still a nice investment for its strong material, which is among the best in the EP trio."
3,NO GO for 1985 Honda Prelude,"Just a note; while this is a fine filter...this does NOT fit the 1985 Honda Prelude, 1.8L engine.Make sure you know what you are buying."
4,fun,I think the game is a lot of fun. Even when you are home alone you can still get some laughter out of it.
2,Copy Cat,"I think this is a knock off of the Rorshock!A game of personality that has been on the market for the last couple of years. For a truly revealing experience, I suggest you try that first."
1,"Enjoy the early plates, ignore ALL the text!","This outsize book begins with some arrestingly beautiful illustrations that reward repeated viewing. But the selection stumbles when it tries to stretch the definition of ""still life"" to include postmodern sculptures like Jeff Koon's basketball in an aquarium and Tony Cragg's pointed objects lined up across a bare floor.But well before that, you'll have thrown up your hands (along with your lunch) at Margit Rowell's text--written in PhDspeak, seeking to plumb new depths of academic obfuscation. For example:""As mentioned earlier, the specific objects of a traditional still life, and their interrelations, obey a rigorously closed and articulated narrative structure, a structure of desire, 'a structure that both invents and distances its object and thereby inscribes again and again the gap between signifier and signified that is the place of negation for the symbolic' [Susan Stewart, 'On Longing'].""Purer than this, drivel doesn't come!"
4,Don't let the price scare you...,"I first found this CD in a ""budget"" section. I live in Arizona where you would expect any cowboy music to be a best seller. This is actually a very talented group from Appalacia on the east coast - so they have very definite folk talents and are top notch with the vocals and fiddle work.The selection of tunes is the epitome of cowboy music, and as I said, it's all done very well. This is a very clean recording with all of the better known cowboy songs. If you're looking for a good launch into cowboy music, this is a very good choice. Again, I must emphaisize that the selection and quality are extremely good - so consider the price a real deal! These guys are good - and a lot of fun!"
3,Mellow,"The songs are sung in a mellow style. However, since they are all by the same group they sound all the same."
4,WHAT YOU PAID IS WHAT YOU WILL GET....AND MORE,"GOOD -1) REASONABLE PRICE2) GOOD STYLING (ESPECIALLY BLACK AND SILVER COMBINATION)3) SUPER SHARP IMAGE (OUTSCORE 400:1 CONTRAST MONITORS)4) AUTOMATIC ADJUSTING (NO NEED TO TOUCH THE MENU / ADJUSTING BUTTON)5) NO DEAD PIXEL (MAY BE I AM LUCKY)BAD -1) NARROW VIEWING ANGLE (ACTUALLY IT'S NOT BAD, IF YOU DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING)2) THE STAND IS TOO HIGH. (HEIGHT IS NOT ADJUSTABLE)3) REPONSE A BIT LATE (WELL IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, BECAUSE I DON'T READ WHEN SCROLLING)4) THE POWER CORD (FROM MONITOR TO POWER ADAPTER) IS TOO SHORT, I NEED TO TAPE THE ADAPTER UNDER MY DESK RATHER THAN PUT IT ON THE FLOOR)5) CONFUSING MENU BUTTONS (THERE IS A BUTTON FOR FORWARD BUT NO BACK BUTTON, YOU NEED TO KEEP CIRCLING THE MENU...)CONCLUSION: BEST BUY FOR [price]RANGE."
4,Excellent for the price,"I bought this at COMPUSA today. The monitor's image looked very sharp. With fine texts due to its 0.26mm small dot pitch. The only problem I found is somehow the bottom part of the screen is slightly brighter, which wouldn't be a problem unless you are so picky. The base also is not not tall or bulky so the screen is not much higher than my old 15"", so I don't need to jack up my chair in order to have my eye looking down toward the screen. All in all, this one beats the more expensive Samsung SyncMaster 770 TFT (which I had and sold) hands down."
2,"Initally Hopeful, But Later Highly Disappointed","... I was worried about what I might get (poorly packaged, dead pixel(s), power cable too short, tilt angle too shallow, top-to-bottom shadowing, cross-hatching, etc.). I thought, ""I'll be lucky and maybe get a good one."" Nope!! I got all of the above negatives plus three new ones. The ""silver"" paint looks like a 4th grader brushed it on (literally all over), plus there is a large scrape/scratch on the upper right side. It has dead pixels plus a strange thick black line about 1/2"" inside the screen (don't even know what this is). Finally, the power goes off about every 5 mins and I have to jiggle the power cord in the monitor's backside to get it back on. I am not a computer jockey, nor a perfectionist. .... My advise - spend perhaps 10-15% more and get a reputable high quality monitor. You'll be glad you did."
4,For the price...,"I'm no professional monitor evaluator, but I can say this is a great product for the price...The monitor does have one deal pixel which is why it gets a 4 instead of five. I'm very happy with everything else though."
2,Not good!,Really bad. I've not had very good luck in contacting the company either. I like the size of it but the picture quality really is poor. One feels like its Halloween there are so many ghosts. And the company response is unsatisfactory. Keep looking for a better machine.
2,You get what you pay for,"The old maxim holds well here. My employer recently bought a set of these monitors and they have been universally poor performers. In particular, they were all plauged with the 'pixel jitter' that is so common to low-end LCDs. If a 17"" panel is something you must have, try a Phillips, a Samsung, or a NEC model. Your eyes are worth the extra cost."
5,Superior Quality at a low price,"I bought this monitor following a recommendation at cNet.com, and it completely surpassed all expectations. For less than the price of many 15"" monitors, the Envision EN-7100e gives you a bright, crisp, and clear 17"" display with ultra-smooth animations. The controls are awkwardly located, but the monitor is completely self-adjusting making them unnecessary. The only trick is to make sure you have the correct color-temperature setting. The silver color only makes it that much more appealing."
4,Very Nice,"I wasn't sure about it after reading the reviews but I got mind today and it was a snap to hook up out of the box put the stand on and it was ready to go in a matter of mins.the auto config made it even better didn't have to do anything so overall for the money and a 17"" I think it is great."
3,Envision 17 Review,"It took awhile to get here, and I must say that I am not as impressed as the first review. I have a Sony 15 inch (I think I paid under ($) for it) that I was going to replace with the Envision. After setting it up in my office, I found it bulky compared to the Sony and not as sharp. Within a day, I moved it into one of our associates office, who did appreciate replacing her CRT. I initially purchased it for my office but quickly pulled my Sony back. I am happy with the purchase, just didn't feel it lived up to the hype on these reviews. There are alot of flat screens on the market these days and the prices are coming down like everything else. Take your time in your selection."
1,It is not a good product,I bought Envision EN-7100e 9 months ago. First time ship me a defected product. The second time ship me a good product but it were broken within 8 month when I only use it around 5 hours per week. The quality is bad.
4,Can't beat the price,"This is one nice display at an incredible price.I would definitely recommend it.A few notes:1) The stand is a bit high so it stands just a bit taller thanyour average monitor would (you cant lower it, but you can angle it down a bit)2) The aspect ration is not the standard 3/4 of regular monitorsit is 4/5 (i.e. a resolution of 600x800 doesn't work well with this display, your text will stretch). You need to make sure your graphics card can handle non-standard resolutions. (1280x1024 is a good resolution to use)At 1280x1024 32bit color and a 75Hz refresh rate it looks incredible. A little bit of ghosting effect when doing stuff like scrolling text and moving windows, but it doesn't show up as much in movies and games).A good buy and it looks INCREDIBLE."
2,Don't buy if you're a gamer,"The monitor looked great with static pages and images, right out of the box. But, as I'm a serious gamer as well, I soon realized that I would have to make a return. Games simply do not perform well on this monitor at all. With high-speed games, especially, there was a lot of ghosting of images and just poor all-around quality. If you're not a gamer, the monitor is great for the price. But if gaming is a big part of your PC experience, look elsewhere. Personally, went back to the big old CRT and, despite the substantial size increase, I'm glad I did.Oh, and as soon as I saw that annoying dead pixel (apparently a common problem here), I also knew I had to make a return. I had no idea that LCD users were expected to live with dead pixels. That seems a bit ridiculous. So, until LCD technology comes up a bit to accomodate perfectionistic gamers like myself, I couldn't recommend this monitor."
1,Poor Quality--will they pay for eye exams?,"I was very excited to plug in and start using my new flat screen. After spending ocuntless hours convicing my wife that I did need a new flat screen monitor, even though it was smaller than my old monitor...you get the picture.Text is blurry. I've tried tweaking the thing. Focus, contrast, brightness, yada-yada. What a disappointment. I do have another TFT LCD High Resolution Color Display to directly compare this to--on my IBM laptop. There is absolutely no comparison.I am taking this monitor back tomorrow. I bought it at the loacl (store) after seeing it here. If you are considering buying one--especially from Amazon--I'd recommend against it. If the quality you experience is anything like what I experienced, you may regret it.Cheers."
1,Can't seem to get one without dead pixels,"My first monitor arrived and had two damaged pixels - one stuck on bright green, the other very dark. Amazon was excellent about sending a replacement but unfortunately, it also had a dead pixel (at least this one was in a better location). The delays from return means not only will I miss the rebate period if I try for a third time (Amazon seemed to direct me towards a refund instead or a replacement), but I also missed a great deal/rebate on my second choice for a monitor, so I am back to square one. If you have time to keep returning / testing monitors, this might be a good deal. I feel the purchase has been a waste of my time."
5,Beautiful and strong little house!,My two little dogs (one is 8 pounds and the other one is 10) fit perfectly in this house. I bought the extra patio and they love sunbathing on it. The house is very strong and very easy to assemble. Nice looking and still looks good after a rough winter.
3,A good CD for an unsigned band,"I thought this was a good CD for a band that released it independently, but I felt there was no coecive style on the CD. Although I liked the slow, ballad like song, ""Little Things,"" I thought it stood out like a sore thumb. Also, some of the songs had a more Steely Dan, Chicago type feel where others had a more George Clinton funk-like feel. Although I would buy their next CD, I think the band should try and focus their style on more funkier stuff (like track 2 Never Enough and track 13 Higher)."
5,Where are these guys?!?,"I bought this CD awhile ago after I saw them at the House of Blues show. Although I thought their CD doesn't do justice to their stellar live performance, I really enjoyed the CD. I am a big fan of track 6 which has a great 70's funk feel.However, since House of Blues I haven't heard or seen these guys anywhere? I hope they are still playing because their sound rocks"
4,Catchy stuff,"I have seen this band live tons of times and it is refreshing to be able to listen to their stuff on CD. I personally love track 5 ""the Void."" The background vocal harmonies are really strong especially Sassy's vocal performance at the end. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the CD doesn't do justice to the band's live performance. The CD is a little to polished for my taste and didn't entirely caputre the live feel. But for someone who hasn't heard the material before, it is worth a listen."
4,Damn Yankees are Really Damn Good!,"When I first listened to this CD, I thought a few of the songs were pretty good - specifically Coming of Age, High Enough, Bad Reputation and Runaway. However, after listening to it a few times, pretty much all of it is damn good! Come Again, Mystified, Tell Me How You Want It are all good rock 'n' roll tunes. Rock City is also a hot one. I could live without Damn Yankees and, yuck, Piledriver (no offense, Mr. Nugent).This album is worth adding to the collection for those Night Ranger style music fans. If you're a Nugent fan, skip this disc unless you really liked Ted's more mellow stuff. But, hey, you might like Piledriver!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"This has got to be the best quartet to hit the studio ever!! I absolutely loved the song Damn Yankees. Jack and Tommy are fabulous on the song ""Bad Reputation"". The way their vocals bounce off of each other is...(I'm speechless)."
1,At the risk of ruining the party,"My god this is bad. It is like an anti-album, if a real album were stacked on top of it it would create matter-antimatter annihilation.Actually it's only a little worse than typical Night Ranger, they were yet another deeply sucky stadium band. But it's sad that a Styx guy couldn't drag this up a bit. And despite his feeblemindedness at least Nugent *sounds* better on his own.When i first heard this i thought it was a demo of a Survivor cover band. And on second listen, of a terrible Survivor cover band. What did this lame Pablum add to the world that Survivor, itself deeply sucky, had not already added? Unless this is all some weird in-joke or you all heard the European import or something?"
5,WORTH THE PRICE,If a CD has at least three good songs its worth buying and this CD has eight. If you like Ted Nuggent and the rock from the 80's and early 90's you'll like this CD. If you like good music that is well crafted you'll like this CD. If you like rock bands that can sing you need to get this CD.
4,I like it,Ten Nugent is the best guitarist on the planet rigth beside Jeff Beck and a few others non namtiond ore forgoten Okey !!! !!!
2,"Something of a ""clunker"" (2.5 stars)","I'm reviewing this book, because I've just read it; also, I'm a bit appalled at the number of high reviews of Dick's work in general.Dick is definitely one of the all-time great SF writers (and he's arguably one of the few geniuses to have worked in the field). Approx 6-10 of his books are classics; however, Dick also wrote a lot of just plain awful books (esp. in the 1950s); and due to his growing popularity, some of these books are actually being brought back into print (e.g., the Man Who Japed, World Jones Made). Luckily Counter-Clock world (1966) isn't one of them; however, this is one of Dick's lesser works. It's a short, mildy amusing read, but the ideas in it are frankly underdeveloped and unconvincing. Race relations also are thankfully much better than depicted in this rather quaint and obsolete ""clunker"" of a book. Save your money and get this from the library; or better yet, read something better (and similar) like Ubik."
3,YAWN!,"My favorite is the ability to save tool presets for every tool. Nothing much is new unless you are a professional Photoshop Illustrator (the brushes are much fancier). The healing tool is nice (but not much faster than experienced use of the Stamp).Mainly it is OSX. That is important and the reason why I bought it. However, there are no OSX drivers for any of my scanners (seven of them). So, be careful!"
4,New Photoshop Version 7,"This is an excellent product for the high-end graphic artist. In case you are not sure if this is the right upgrade for you, this product will upgrade from the full versions of Photoshop 4 and higher. Note that this product WILL NOT work with Photoshop Elements or Photoshop LE, as these are less thourough versions of Photoshop."
3,"GOOD STUFF, BUT WITH A BIG FLAW","""Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Upgrade"" may not offer the kind of price many people would like to see, but there are lots of interesting features. This Upgrade runs fast, and on any Windows OS that is not earlier than '98. Also, both the image-editing tools and the file browser have been enhanced. If you are a photographer, a Web designer, or as the case may be, just interested in digital imaging, the improved colour and pattern simulating tools will make your work easier.However, you will be disappointed to discover that this 'Photoshop 7.0' delivers a good job only when you work with 8-bit colour. Support for 16-bit colour is almost non-existent! Based on this, I don't regard it as a must-have Upgrade for anyone running 'Photoshop 6'; but that doesn't mean that it is worthless."
2,Entire book conveys one simple idea.,"Although the book short, I found it much too long for the simple idea it conveys. The book focuses on a man named Herman Being as he moves through a process of learning to appreciate classical music. Despite the underdeveloped and unrealistic subplots, this book does succeed in presenting the author's idea that repetitive listening is the best way to gain an appreciation for classical music. The book is humorous and enjoyable but I would not recommend it to a friend."
1,"Would give it negative stars, if possible.","There was no way to make the end caps fit the axle, so the wheels kept falling off. I actually got a case of the giggles trying to use this thing ... it's a total joke. I'd be willing to pay for something to move around my heavy hammock, so Pawley's Island should think about making something more substantial. I'm returning this item -- first time I've ever returned anything from Amazon -- and am going to Home Depot to see if I can jerryrig something. No, I'm not handy, but I know I can make something better than this piece of junk! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Junk...Save Your Money,"Talk about cheap. Completely fails in all aspects of functionality. I just installed it and now its going back. Wheels fell off, U bolt slips, nuts can not be tighten too much otherwise the plastic bracket will crack. All this after one day!"
1,flimsy,There were no directions on installation included.The axle part broke before I could get it on.Very dissatisfied with this.
3,Average product,"The plastic wheels worry me, as does the plastic frame. Will they last? The way they get attached to the frame is also kind of cheap, not to mention awkward if you need to tighten them (and the provided instructions on this aren't very realistic - attach the bracket first, then the wheels? yeah, right). I entered three stars, but thinking about it, I'm wondering if maybe I should drop it to two."
2,"Cheap, weak plastic",The wheels on the axle bend with the weight of the hammock and stand. The bracket doesn't stay in place. It barely works well enough to move a few feet while I cut the lawn.
3,"Pretty cheap, but works, barely.",I wouldn't get this again. I think I'd have something made rather than this cheap bunch of plastic.The design is marginal.
3,A little fragile,Item came on time and it does the job very well. The wheels feel sturdy but the connector looks flimsy.
1,Even the axle is plastic,"If they had at least made the product with a metal axle it could have been tightened to keep the wheels from wobbling and working itself off, which it does on a regular basis. Save your money."
3,"Cheaply made, works ok","This entire thing (with the exception of the U-bolt and wheel bolts) is made of a hard palstic. Rubber tires would be nicer, but then the price would probably go up.My biggest complaint with this is that after attaching the wheels to the hammock stand, they slowly creep up the stand making it so you have to lift one side of the hammock hire and hire in order to engage the wheels. Eventually, you have to loosen the U-bolt and move the wheels back down to the base of the hammock stand. Rather than unscrew the U-bolt, I have sometimes tried using a hammer to hit the U-bolt back down the hammock stand pole, but it scratches the pole a little bit, and one of these days I'm sure it will just break the plastic fixture.When the wheels haven't crept up on the stand, it works great. It is nice to be able to move the stand off of the lawn when you need to mow, or to move it into a more shade-filled part of the yard."
3,Unsteady attachment,"Installation was simple..when moving the hammock because the shaft is plastic it bends,is unsteady and feels as if it will break. and it will at some point. I would suggest looking for a similar product with a more solid shaft. I was surprised that Pawleys would put their name on this cheaply made item."
1,"Cheap and will not last, not to mention does not work","I bought this for my Pawley's Hammock stand. Very cheaply made, all plastic, even the axle. It immediately collapsed under the weight of the stand. I don't even no why I wasted several hours trying to get it to work. I would throw this away if you gave it to me."
3,Sunshine,I liked the wheels for pushing the hammock but it wasn't any big deal for my husband. I wish they would make them is neutral colors so they wern't so noticable in the yard. I like them inspite of that.
1,Actually ZERO stars,"What a piece of junk. If all the components cost $1. wholesale, I'd be surprised. Very low grade plastic. The metal wheel caps will simply not fit on the wheels and as a result the wheels wobble off the axle every time you use it. Seemingly designed by a monkey. Comes without assembly instructions too--although it's so basic you can figure it out after a few minutes. And just because it's assembled, doesn't mean it will actually work. Surprised that Pawleys Island put their name on this."
4,A Fun Time Capsule,"We really enjoy this classic from the ""Big Band"" era...a trip back in time with an entertaining story. The quality of the DVD could be better, but Don Defore is at his best (remember him as Ozzie Nelson's neighbor)? I highly recommend for old movie buffs!"
3,5 Star Movie with a 3 Star Treatment,"Just a quick note on the DVD quality of the Alpha Release. Print quality is completely watchable not great but if you love the movie its well worth the cheap price. Its one of the better Alpha releases. The contrast is a little light and during one of the songs the film is a little shakey. I've viewed this film on two tv's and 1 computer each with their own leval of visual clarity, with the computer being the best. The sound is pretty good it olnly gets a little hiss-y when the volume is turned up.The songs sung by Betty Hutton are:""Love Me""""If I had A Dozen Hearts""""Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief""""In the Shade Of the Old Apple Tree""""I'm A Square In the Social Circle""I Hope this Helps................"
4,I love this movie,"I live on TCM and while this isn't the best movie from that era I've seen, I do love it. I just love Betty Hutton. She's amazing and I just love her voice. Yes, the audio isn't perfect. Yes, some of the picture quality isn't there, but this was made in 1945 and it was a small budget movie. What do you expect. Just because it wasn't made in the same grandeur of Gone With The Wind or The Wizard Of Oz, doesn't make it a bad movie. Yes it's predictable. But aren't all love stories.I love the fashion and hair styles of that era and this is a great visual pleasure for me. Lots of great hair styles, lots of great dresses.I've watched this twice already. If you like old love stories and like to laugh, this is a good buy. God bless you Betty."
4,A surprisingly highly entertaining movie!!,"Ok, you can imagine that a dvd by this company and for this price ain't gonna be a big-budget deal. So what? I bought this because I saw one movie with Betty Hutton and really liked her, and for this price it was really a no-brainer.I didn't expect to have so much fun and it being so entertaining. Betty Hutton is hilarious during all movie, there is NEVER A DULL MOMENT (something that can't be said about loads of so-called classics), and the supporting cast is up to it.I don't think there is a character in this movie you won't like.There are loads of standout funny moments, LOL for me, two of which include the mink fur.The quality of the transfer is not great, for a couple of seconds it gets really out of focus, but it's over in a matter of seconds.Money well spent!!!"
3,get the DVD instead of the video,"the vhs version leaves out the song..""doctor, lawyer, indian chief"".... the picture and sound on the DVD is better although could be improved.......the dvd outshines the video by miles........i have both versions and i'm sorry i bought the video......betty hutton is great in the film....worth having in your collection just for her antics.........betty gets 10 stars by herself...."
1,Not Happy with Hammock,"We received this hammock for our wedding in 2000 and in the summer of 2002 a couple of the ropes broke, so we can no longer use it. I would think for $90.00 we would have gotten at least 5 summers out of it. We put it away for the winter and it still didn't last very long."
1,Two hammocks - both returns!,"I ordered this hammock. Very disappointed.The first one arrived with obvious signs of having been shipped to someone else and returned. It was also marked ""defective"" and ""AS-IS"", as well as ""Made in China.""Amazon quickly agreed to send a replacement.The replacement was even more obviously a previously-returned hammock. I have requested a refund and am returning it also. Two strikes is enough.It is doubly troubling that nowhere are the words ""Made in China"" mentioned on the Amazon site, and that Amazon sends out previously returned and defective hammocks.I have bought a replacement US-made hammock from the original Hammock Shop. It is more expensive, but I expect it to be first quality and to last longer."
5,Great Service on the product,i received Pawley's Island Hammock and spend this warm and clear sunday afternoon lounging in the Florida sun. It arrived quickly and in perfect shape.
1,Mislead,"I purchased this product thinking it would be a great gift for my boyfriend who had been wanting a hammock. When I saw this one with the stand for $89.00 I was thinking how perfect. When the package arrived there was no stand. I thought, since the picture showed a stand with it and the description included a stand that I would get the freaking stand, but I didn't. I tried to call so I could return it but no one ever answered or returned my phone calls. I would not purchase this product if I were you. They lie."
3,Chinese on Pawleys Island?,"The ad, the box, the internet site all tout the merits of this item engineered in South Carolina. When the box was opened, the tiny tag dangling from the weave states ""Mfg in China."" Too bad! The hammock is the same price as the last two I've purchased, and still is of good quality, but I'll think long and hard before purchasing another. Hey, I might even take up hammock weaving as a hobby."
3,Untied upon arrival,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He was so excited and put it up immediatly. Upon my first inspection of the hammock, I found one of the ropes untied. I was extremly upset. Rather than spend the money to send it back, I decided to just tie it up. Hopefully it will hold. I had high hopes as far as quality goes, but I would say it was average or less than average."
1,Cheating!,Don't be misled by the advertisement! They ship the hammock without the stand. It is simple and straightforward cheating
4,Another Winner For Mr. Franks!!!,"I have been listening to Michael Franks since the late 70's. He has a unique soft voice...that people seem to either love or hate. His songs can be serious or cynical...love songs or break-up songs. The top selections on this one are The Art Of Love, Long Slow Distance...on this one he ties running into a relationship with a person. Vincent's Ear (this is a tribute to Vincent van Gogh). Also Crayon Sun (Safe At Home). This one may be my particular favorite on this CD. In my opinion this is another winner for Mr. Franks!!!! Buy it and you'll see what I mean."
3,gray thoughts,"First of all let me start by saying I have been a Michael Franks fan since I was 18 and I'm 40 now.So I can pretty much say that I have a pretty good idea on what his music is about.So Blue Pacific has it's highnotes and maybe one or two low notes.I think that if there wrere more songs along the lines of ""Vincent's Ear"",""On The Inside"",""Chez Nous"" and ""Crayon Sun"" to keep the wimsical flavor of the cd that would have been cool.But if you have this cd by all means it is not a bad buy but may take a few listens to really get into the flavor of it. I have to say though that any fan of Michael Franks is a friend of mine because it takes a special kind of person to groove too and fully understand what brother Michael has to say.peace Paris"
2,Like driving a Ferrari in a school zone.,"Like a lot of big operatic voices, Voigt is hard to capture on CD; her recordings of Wagner and Strauss excerpts are good, but they can't convey the experience of hearing her live in an opera house. And singing with only piano accompaniment, as here, she simply can't use most of the power in her voice. As sensitive as her performances are I can't help feeling that she's having to hold back. For American song sung with more delicacy and grace I would suggest Barbara Bonney or Dawn Upshaw (I can't agree with previous reviewers' suggestion of Cheryl Studer's Barber, though Hampson is wonderful on that set)."
3,Mixed results,"This is an interesting collection of American songs, but I don't feel that Ms Voigt sold these selections to me. She still sounds like an opera singer trying to squeeze a very powerful and large voice into smaller setting for these songs, with mixed success. She is much, much better than many of her fellow sopranos that tried such repertoire, but I feel that she only gets it right in Amy Beach and Griffes songs. And even there, she does not have a sound that would make every song recital fan happy.And what's with the title of this album? I think she is a classy artist and deserves better than such silly title, her label probably came up with that.Nice try overall, but I hope Ms Voigt will do more Strauss and Wagner from now on, not more songs like these."
1,May have a heart but what good is it if the artistic results are a void?,"The header says it all. Thumbs down all the way. Get instead the Samuel Barber double set with Cheryl Studer and Thomas Hampson if you wish to experience true heartrending Americana. As another reviewer put it, you get no gimmicks and no camp from these two distinguished artists."
1,All My Inexperience,"Did anyone dare say that Voigt is a competent interpreter of song? Since when? You want committed and gorgeous interpretations of some of the American classical song literature? Let me direct you then to the by now legendary recording of Samuel Barber's songs by two bona fide artists - Cheryl Studer and Thomas Hampson (with the Emerson String Quartet and the late pianist John Browning). ""All the Heart"" you may desire is contained there and then some. But without the gimmicks and the camp.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005V8YT/qid=1127668019/sr=2-3/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_3/103-4933358-0841449?v=glance&s;=classical"
2,"Cute Blocks, Chipping Paint","Received this set as a birthday gift. Love the shapes, sizes and colors. Multiple ways to stack, sort, etc. Unfortunately the painted blocks were already chipping after just one use. And chipping badly. I found little bits of yellow and red paint here and there in the carpet...which makes me wonder, more importantly, how many were ingested by my child. I would recommend perhaps the plain unpainted blocks, tho not as cute. Too bad, really."
4,Quiet and Compliant,I had unexplained shutdowns with the Coolmax V-400 power supply. Replacing it with the Coolmax CXI-450B cured them. As both supplies are from the same manufacturer and both claim to be ATX12V 2.XX compliant I’m not sure what the problem was. The CXI-450B is quiet and is running stably. I wish it were modular as I could leave out cabling that I don’t need. All in all a quiet and stable power supply.
3,A pleasant little find,"Found this one in a discount bin. Wait! It's a Pretenders CD. They're good, right? Let's give it a listen. Turns out to be a pleasant album to listen to, and worth keeping. Seems to be more a a reflective personal album than one made to hit the charts big time. Which is why it's three stars. I enjoy listening to it, but it could use a couple of killer singles to anchor it down. Nice album, but not much I'd put on a ""Best of"" set."
5,What a pleasant surprise,"I bought this album a week ago and it hasn't left my cd player since. I LOVE it. Can't say enough good things, so many great songs, so many different feels to each song. I bought the cd used along with several new titles. The new titles came in a week and a half - this one came in TWO days. If you like acoustic guitar and singer songwriter type music buy it! This is my first Shawn Mullins CD, although I had heard Lullaby on the radio, & liked the song, I didn't like it well enough to actually buy the CD. I'm glad that hearing his music on Virgin Radio got me a bit more interested in Shawn's music, I am most impressed and will be watching for more Shawn Mullins."
5,One of the best on the market!,This Panasonic Hi-fi VCR is a great buy that would go great in any household. It shows films extremley well and their is never any snow fuzz on the screen. The fast forward and reind options are great as they are done in hardly any time at all. The only thing about this VCR is that I don't like is that whenever a dirty film goes in it always shows snow fuzz for a few minutes. But that happens with all VCR's doesn't it? Well any ways this is a great VCR that will go great in any house or dorm or whatever. Buy and enjoy.ENJOY!
5,Panasonic PV-4540,The product is great. The price is fair with stereo hifi. What is more you could ask for. I had one and plan to buy one more for my daughter.
1,Poor choice,"This has to be one of the most poorly designed remote controls I have come across. The most frequently used buttons are so small they are difficult to find and activate, especially the CM Skip (commercial skip). You cannot press this twice in succession, but have to wait a few seconds after it stops to start it again. In order to stop a timed recording, you have to hit the power off button(which does not turn the power off) and then hit ""stop"". The ""program"" and ""menu"" keys are also very difficult to find. I made a very poor choice when purchasing this VCR, and if it were possible, I would gladly return it in exchange for anything except another Panasonic."
5,SPEED Channel SUPERCARS Hennesy Ford GT 1000,"- Doll shipped me the BLACK Ford GT - Excellent door-fit, detail, and paint for a 1/36 scale diecast car -I have seen the Hennesy modified black Ford GT 1000 (horsepower) racing a lime-green Hennesy Viper 1000 (horsepower) on ""SUPERCARS"" on the SPEED Channel - Great action! I could only find a 1/36 Viper in Yellow - but close enough for now These are the same scale cars as the larger Corgi ""CC"" 1/36 James Bond 007 movie cars - These are ""pullback"" models made by KINSMART Great price - and bought it with my Amazon PRIME free 2-Day Shipping - a really great feature for Amazon customers Fit of doors - compares favorably with the high-end Danbury Mint and Franklin Mint 1/24 diecast cars --30-"
5,It's About Time!,"Brandy, being a R&B/Soul idol since the mid to late 90's to the present, and also starring in the sitcom Moesha and in the re-make of Cinderella, has had some big hits. Finally, she came out w/ a best of album. I have some different tracks on my album than Amazon.com has, but i believe i got the better deal. I believe that Brandy should have come out w/ this album eariler (before the release of Afrodisiac, her second best album to this one.)"
4,This girl can sing,"I grow tired of all the superficial extras used to hide the fact that a number of today's artists just are not gifted vocalists. That sultry alto voice Brandy has been given is clear and easily moves you ... even without the bass... You actually understand what she is singing about.... Give me an artist who can really sing and I'll show you an artist who doesn't need loud, annoying music..."
5,For The Little Brandy Fan . . .,"This is for you. The Cd has all of her biggest hits that people are familiar with. It also goes in order with her albums and has singles she has released on soundtracks. I like Brandy very much and I have her ''Never Say Never'' cd however I was never a big fan. Which is one of the reason's I brought this album. All of my favorites are here. Like ''Best Friend'', ''Broken Hearted'', ''What About Us?'' and ''Full Moon''. The thing I love most is that even her lesser known hits like ''Who Is She 2 u?'' is on here. I just wish they had put the remix with Usher on here too.Overall, good greatest hits collection."
4,pretty accurate collection; 2008 UPDATE,"This ""Best of Brandy"" is a great collection of Brandy's greatest hits starting from her frist self titled album to her 4th, Afrodisiac. I knocked off 1 star because ""Rock With You"" was a remake of Michael Jackson's song (same name) and it was totally ruined by Heavy D adding rap lyrics to it. Rap remakes of MJ's songs do not sound good. Otherwise, If you're a Brandy fan, Get this album. You won't be sorry.. 2008 UPDATE : But go with the MP3 Download edition....... It's got the Darkchild remix to ""The Boy Is Mine"" with rapper Shaunta. That is such a great remix. I've listened to it over and over on the promo vinyl. Monica fans will be dissappointed in the remix becuase she's not on it but still It's a great remix"
4,Brandy her old songs mixed into new songs,"When I frist heard Brandy in 1994 She was singing like angelmy favorite songs are Baby, Best Friend, The Boy Is Mine, FullMoon, Sittin in My Room, Angel in Disguise and of Course BorkenHerated. The Best Of Brandy album is kind of cool laid back andsmile at the same time."
4,Brandy is still down,"Of the two new CDs that I've bought this year, this one is worth the money. The music is classic and enjoyable. I'm disappointed though that ""He Is"" and ""Aprhodisiac"" aren't on the version that I got from Target. But overall, this CD is good and it's about time that a real artist like Brandy- who was been around for a decade- has put out a greatest hits album."
3,Pretty Good,"Brandy was the Modern Day Star of Her time in that She was a Recording Artist,did Tv, did Film&was a Model. very Versatile. now back to the Music:Brittney,Christina&everyone there after owe it all to Her for being able to do other things as a Teen Act. Brandy always had catchy cuts or the Mellow Slow Cut.Her voice had a good Husky tone but with a smoothness to it.i dug Her stuff more overall in the 90's,but every now&then she has a cut that is cool. it's puzzling to me now because though She has been around for well over a Decade i gotta wonder if She is on the ropes as a Musical Artist? I wonder what's next for Her Career? but this set shows a Artist who at one time was ""Sitting on Top of the world""."
5,All Classic Brandy Songs,"I was very happy with the selection of Brandy songs that were put on this album. All of these songs are my absolute favorites from Brandy. They all show her growth and her range from the first single ""Baby"" to her most current work ""Afrodisiac"". This is one of the best ""greatest hits"" or ""best of"" albums that I have purchased in a while. Some of my favorites on this CD are ""Baby"", ""Best Friend"", ""I Wanna Be Down"", ""Angel In Disguise"", ""Sittin Up In My Room"", ""Talk About Our Love"", and ""Almost Doesn't Count"". I recommend this album for any Brandy fan or R&B fan. BKLYNBABYLON signing off..."
4,Best Of Albums Always Have One Good Song Missing.,"I love this album. Brandy is great and very talented. I didn't enter a fifth star, becuase Sitting Up In My Room isn't on here. That would have made this absolutely the best. All the other songs are great though and you'll love this."
3,"Good, but Depressing","The animation in this show is top notch, and the visuals are engaging. There is lots of relationship going on among the main characters. That said, it is also very depressing. Every episode begins with the question ""Will you kill person you love because you love them?"" so I am not really giving any spoilers here. They spend the entire series developing the relationships and showing you that the people love one another. Then they have to turn around and chop the others to bits because they are possessed by evil spirits. All the violence happens on screen, so you see a lot of blood, sword cuts, and limbs being cut off. In the end, the person who is causing all this trouble and releasing the evil spirits isn't even caught. I supposed that that leaves the door open for a sequel.I just looked at the Amazon header at the top of the page for this and it says that it is rated G. Don't believe it. It should be rated R."
3,Entertaining But Generic Anime,"If you've seen other animes like Freezing or Witchblade then the overall story and characters shouldn't really shock you, you'll of course get to see the somewhat generic subplot of the camaraderie between friends and fellow warriors and the shock of betrayal and naivety that comes from the introduction of the newest warrior. The characters are enjoyable to watch and the action is good but as you see what happens you can't help but somewhat let out a groan and think ""Haven't we've seen this done before a hundred times?""Regardless the animation and soundtrack fit nicely together and the voice cast for the subbed and dubbed played their character roles well. For the price it's worth still getting for your anime collection but just remember like with the series Freezing keep any real expectations of anything new of the series in your head low."
1,Fair warning,"This isn't so much a review as a fair warning to anyone, who like me, does not enjoy tragedy for tragedy's own sake. I loved everything about this anime except the ending. It's pretty awful. I sat there waiting and hoping for some type of redemption, but it never comes. Wish I never watched it. Left me with a sick feeling in my stomach."
5,Use this book to start learning Russian,"This book series, in my experience, is the best way to start learning Russian. It is more helpful in conjunction with the workbook, and most helpful when combined with the written exercises in the workbook and oral exchange with other people (there's a tape series that goes with this, but if you have people who are learning with you to talk to, the tapes aren't really necessary). It covers all the basic conversational topics like greetings, weather, telling time, etc. And for the most part, the phrases in the book (even the colloquialisms) are still in use today. So if you want to start learning Russian, order this book and the workbook right away!"
5,Learning a language by yourself,"I notice a lot of these reviews say ""not for self learning!!!"" Of course not, it's a language! Only the basics should be self taught like the alphabet and some basic grammar so that you can save yourself some time and money with a tutor. If you're enrolled in a Russian class, that's already in the curriculum anyhow. If you're going to learn a language, you're going to have to have the self discipline to dedicate a lot of your free time to self study along with a tutor or someone willing to help you learn. You can also find people online to speak with living in Russia(or said language). I would plug a site that I've used for that purpose, but I don't know if Amazon would consider this comment spam. Self study alone will not do anything but teach you basics that you probably won't be able to apply much."
1,Mr Toms Was the opposite of what Ms Hay is all About,"I felt the interviewer asked some horrible questions. Who says that you are old at 40? He did. He asked Ms Hay about her thoughts on her dying...Come on...Ms Hay answered wonderfully but the questions asked were ridiculous and if anything, left me depressed and feeling old...just the opposite of what Ms Hay tries to teach."
1,"Great Guest, Terrible Interviewer","Louise Hay is usually an excellent speaker, but this interviewer was AWFUL. He talked too much (without saying anything of value), and his inappropriate questions showed that he was unfamiliar with Louise's philosophy and lacked the basic interviewing skills to bring out her usual words of insight. I have no idea why this interview was saved and is being sold as a tape. Try one of the other Louise Hay tapes instead - most are excellent."
1,"Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life",Complete waste of money ... no insight ... no information ... lousy interview ... wish I could get a refund.
5,Perhaps it's her soothing voice or her forgiving tone,"or her incredible insight into why the thoughts I have affect my mood and esteem. A perfectionist, I like to be first at the light, judgemental of others' choices, and annoyed when I don't perform at my high expectations. The tape taught me how to adjust my thoughts to accept what I can't change in my life. The host did a good job of asking her to explain some of her statements, allowing some of the great ""Hay-isms"" to evolve. I'm a huge fan of Louise. I read and, later, re-read her works. Her life lessons are invaluable."
1,Keep looking . . .,"The author's focus is targeted at senior citizens. If you are a generation x product, the cassette will offer little insight. I figured it would be more inspirational, and perhaps even contain some useful tips. But alas, no such luck, it was just the ramblings of an older woman. Rather than invest money in this cassette, I suggest you order a pizza. The pizza would only provide you a moment of enjoyment, but that is more than you would get from this cassette."
3,"Great monitor, awful stand","The monitor itself works fine but be aware the stand for it is not height adjustable nor can it tilt, making it very difficult to use. I will likely return it, it's a great screen just not very usable without being able to adjust it. And I'm not a kid."
3,Alright group of photos some well known and others that are not,Fairly nice group of photos and the dialogue in the book. This is a nice book to look at but not necessarily a must have to add to your collection. If you collect JFK books and pictures and other item then it would be good to add to your collection when ever you can. The rare pictures that we don't often see are the reasons to buy the book...some even show the real closeness between Jack and Jackie.
5,Identifying with Cress,"I plan to read Cress Delahanty to my daughter when she's about 10 or 11. The author, Jessamyn West, has captured the ""evanescent"" (one of Cress's favorite words) nature of a young girl's personality as she is growing up. The book is a collection of stories about a girl between the ages of 11 and 17 who lives on a ranch in Southern California. Each chapter entrances the reader with Cress's shenanigans. You think she is doing something outlandish or brave; you think the story is going one way, and then you get a view into the workings of Cress's mind and you suddenly understand what she's doing and the story goes in a different direction. As an adolescent I loved Cress because she was me, in all her insecurity, feats of boldness, crass humanity and growing understanding of boys, friends, family and relationships.The last chapter transcends all and always makes me cry."
5,"A touching, real view of growing up as a girl","Jesamyn West gives us a character in Crescent Delahanty that is so real you think she just might have been your friend when you were thirteen. Cres, as she is called in the book represents the struggles for peer acceptance and young love that any young woman can relate to. West's acute attention to the details of Cres's external environment (growing up on a ranch) and the other characters who impact on Cres's life deserves applause."
1,Arrived dented,Shipper sent pans with a smidgen of packing....both pan bottoms were bent. Inside of Wilton pan bottoms are textured to the point that removing the cheesecake is virtually impossible. I have been making cheesecakes for many years and have never had a problem like I had with these pans. Have spoken with a bakery owner who concurred she is having the same problem.
5,The only pan for crusted cakes,"When making cheesecakes or any crusted cake or torte with a creamy texture, there is simply no acceptable substitute for the Wilton springform. A non-springform would demand turning the cake upside down to release it, and manually flipping it--a non-option for any heavy, creamy baked goody. Also, it is easy to transport the cake in the pan, (I just wrap aluminum foil over the top), without worrying about the crust slipping around on a cake tray. I've tried other brands, but they don't hold up to my constant use, and the spring-lock loses it efficacy quickly. The waffled bottom does allow for easier removal if the pan is lightly greased, but I always line the botom of the pan with parchment paper before putting the crust and batter in, making grease unnecessary and post-baking handling easier."
2,Wilton Cheesecake Pan,Very poor quality. Thin composition.I would prefer a heavier constructed pan.Has blemishes on sides of pan.I assumed Wilton would have better quality cake pans.
5,If you like New Orleans R&B this is the real deal,"This is a 1-CD sampler of songs taken from the box set entitled ""Crescent City Soul: The Sound of New Orleans 1947-74."" The full box set is rare and going for big buck$ these days, so this sampler is worth its weight in gold, as far as I'm concerned.It starts off just where it should, with Fats Domino's ""Fat Man Blues"" and continues on through a myriad of well-known and lesser known artists' best tunes. Whether it Fats, or the original recording of ""Bon Ton Roulet,"" or Dave Bartholomew singing ""The Monkey Speaks His Mind"" or the original version of ""Fortune Teller"" ..just too much fun.The beauty of this collection is that original New Orleans R&B; is a unique sound, different from Memphis, Detroit, etc., and this CD brings to life that difference in a way that makes you smile, just like one would smile when one sets foot in the Crescent City for the first time. God Bless New Orleans."
2,This Book is not for everyone,"I'm somewhat new to Flash, although I understand Flash well enough to design most things seen on the web, the actionscripting used in the book was far more advanced than I anticipated. I bought the book because I'm interested in better audio for my projects, but after reading about 1/2 the book, I'm going to have to put it away until I have a better understanding of actionscripting. I would not recomend this book to the beginner or even intermediate designer."
3,"Pretty decent, easy to use, nice quality pics.","I bought this camera ... and have had no problems at all. I bought some rechargables from Ebay for seven dollars and charge one set while I use the other. They last for AT LEAST 48 pics for me, probably more.If you don't know a lot about computers, this camera is very easy to figure out how to use. The editing software is no good for cropping, but does take out the red-eye. Outdoor shots are great. I got the two best pics of my kids yesterday that I have ever seen - no comparison to a 35mm cam. And I can print great looking photos any size I want, as many as I want, to share.You will need another photo card if you want to take more than 10 pics."
2,battery eater,"this camera works great...for about 5 minutes..and the batteries go kaput...i have tried regular AA batteris...rechargables...neither work for longer than a few pictures...and i am on my SECOND camera...HP does have pretty good customer service, they sent me a new camera, BUT...i am having the same problem...waiting on them to send me some photo lithium batteries to see if it works, if it doesnt i am requesting a full refund...what a shame!...great pics, easy to use, just cant be replacing the batteries every 5 minutes!!"
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,"First, it sucks up the battery real fast, I said well that's not such a big problem, but after 3.5 months the camera started making this crankling noise and got stuck forever. It's supose to be the logic card, that's like the motherboard for a PC. I was reading some of the reviews, and I saw the same problem in some of them. Apparently costumer service is not going to do much for me, so I guess I lost the money. Maybe at the end they'll loose more than me."
1,Beware of Warranty terms....,"I bought this camera as a Christmas present for my husband and it worked fine for about six pictures and then it simply quit working...I am so very sorry I bought this camera. My advice is, if you want to throw away good money and have nothing but trouble, buy this camera. I'm completely disgusted!"
1,Hewlett Packard continues to make garbage,"I owned a Photosmart 612 for about a year before the motor on the camera went and none of the pictures would not focus. That made what was a mediocre camera turn into a paperweight. Since the 612 isn't sold anymore, my service plan replaced it with an 812. Three weeks into ownership it too has turned into a paperweight, the flash no longer works.My advice to buy a digital camera from an actual camera manufacturer."
1,I returned it in the next day,"Battery-eating is 1 problem. But the biggest thing is the quality of the pictures. After I took about 50 pictures, there was even no one satisfied me. It is true that I am not a photographer. But I am not that bad."
4,Where's the Power?,"This is my third digital camera (I also have a wonderful Toshiba PDR-M1 (1.3 Mp) and a horrible, full of bugs Kodak DX 3600). I really like the HP PS812 except that it does not come with any way to power the camera except two batteries.There is a camera dock, which is OK, but not something that I really want to carry on trips.There is supposedly an optional AC adapter, but HP gives absolutely no hint in its included documentation or on its web site what the part number is. Looking through the reviews here on Amazon.com for AC adaptors for HP cameras, it is obvious that getting an adapter is an iterative process of buying and returning until a lucky purchase works.If anyone has found the magic AC adapter that works, please post which one it is."
2,dont buy this unless.....,"do NOT buy this camera unless you enjoy spending lots and lots of money on batteries...regular AA batteries last about 5 minutes, rechargables only slightly longer....i am waiting on Hewlett Packard to send me some photo lithiums to try...if they dont work any better, i am demanding my money back!..of course that doesnt mean i'll get it back!...takes great pictures, easy to use....just drains batteries quick as a flash!..not worth the trouble...the thing is too expensive for this!!"
2,"Not bad, not great. A HUGE letdown from their previous album, Bringing Home the Ashes","The Wild Swans 1988 debut album, Bringing Home the Ashes, is a home run: Excellent melodic angsty songs, good chimey arrangements, well sung, winning from end-to-end.At the time of its initial release, I was quite looking forward to this, the followup (and as it would unfold, final) major label album. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The melodies don't stick, the lyrics seem slight, and ultimately it passes without making much impression. Such a disappointment. It's not horrible; just horribly mediocre.Go back and get Bringing Home the Ashes, which holds up quite well 23 years on. This album is simply a footnote to a career that didn't really play out the way it appeared it might."
4,White field marker,"I bought this to use it at my son's preschool's sport festival.The school has been using spray paint field marker for years, but it was expensive andwe decided to try something different.For a small sport field we used half a bag.We used it on grass, and the lines were difficult to see from far away.We applied the marker several times to make sure the lines were visible.Still, it's a money saver compared to spray paint marker, and we would buy this again.It would probably work well if you are going to use it on soil (or very short grass) baseball/soccer field."
1,Falls way short.,"A great many of the exercises in this book require the electronic templates specially created for the class (apparently this book was written by some Community college folks for one of their classes). NO CD or URL accompanies the book to access the electronic templates leaving readers SOL for some of the exercises. Even at used book prices, it wasn't worth it."
4,Refreshed,"I love the refreshed colors! The only way to make this product easier to use is if somebody else performs the coloring process for me. This is the only product I have found that works successfully for me, as I have allergic reacts to most semi-permanent & permanent dyes. The gentle process does not bother my scalp or skin, and leaves behind a very mild & pleasant smell."
3,"reddish brown, did they say?","I'm happy to have found some of the old Loving Care product they've discontinued - along with the lovely conditioner Clairol used to include before they decided to get cheap and put in the useless stuff that comes with Natural Instincts. I just have to wonder a bit about the color, and whether this stuff might ""go bad"" after a while. I was expecting my mostly light brown hair to look like the woman's on the box, it's not even remotely that red, not even orangey, mostly just brown with my grays looking dark yellow."
4,Good Product,"This is a good product. It is gentle and has no offensive odor. My hair feels healthy and shiny. The color is much brighter and more flattering than my natural color which was becoming dull. The color looks incredibly natural. When applying it, I was worried it was going to be too dark but it is a very nice deep chestnut shade and is a close match to my natural color. The only problem is that it didn't cover my gray hairs 100%--I probably got about 90% coverage. I am about 15-20% gray and most of the hairs are covered but some are still visible. They are a lot less noticeable but not completely gone, especially around the temples. I took a lot of care to saturate that area with the dye so I am not sure what happened. Perhaps I didn't leave it on long enough (I left it on 20 minutes). Next time I will leave it on longer.Overall, this is a great product and I would highly recommend it for people who are wary of permanent dyes with all their harsh chemicals."
1,I don't recommend this product,"It is time consuming (requires wet hair) and ineffective. Didn't cover my gray at all, even though I kept it on my hair up to max recommended time."
3,Just Say No!,"The only way to respond to not to buy any Clairol products. The discontinuation of CLC shows that they have no interest in the needs of women over 40. In the Korean beauty supply stores, there are many brands of temporary hair color in all shades. None have the texture of CLC but they don't have peroxide or ammonia and last as long. Th products in the Beautful collection don't last as long as the CLC, nor does the newer line that purports to last longer. Natural Instincts is not an option for those of us who are trying to avoid peroxide. Let's just use other brands,"
5,Review of Bent Red Moon,"I fell in love with the story of Bent Red Moon! It was the kind of book that grabbed my attention from beginning to end. The setting of rustic hills in Texas was so real I could almost feel the heat from the sun and the grit on my tongue. My favorite part was seeing how Mick and his dark skinned friend would get out of the trouble that seemed to follow them everywhere. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves westerns, romance, excitement and mystery all wrapped up in one."
2,Velcro delimma,"The SECOND time I removed the iPAQ from the case the Velcro stuck to the case and would not stick to the iPAQ again. What do you do then? Without Velcro, the case does not serve its purpose - or the hand held bounces around inside. I have contacted Sumdex, but have not heard from them yet. Velcro is great but...."
4,A great little iron for seams and corners,This little iron works great for pressing corners and seams. I keep it right by my sewing machine so I don't have to walk over to my ironing board every time I want to press down a seam or corner.
4,iron seams,The mini-iron does a fairly good job for ironing seams and small areas. The stand is a must although I wish it were a bit more sturdy.
1,typical bad WcW,Man it doesn't get much worse than this PPV! Did anyone care about nash and hogan? Why was Goldberg in a program with Rick Stiener?
2,a big joke,The Hogan and Bischoff against Page and Jay Leno was stupid and the rest pretty much s*ck to since they thought the Hogan match was going to be big. Dumb event.
1,please do not waste your money,this pay-per view event sucked a$$. hogan is about a 100 years old bischoff is 200 years old and leno chin is 1000 feet long and page can't fight at all the only reason he wins is cause he lives next to bischoff
1,definitely not for large dogs. should have told me this in advance,"These foot balls do not last long. I was unaware these were not for larger dogs. $25.00 down the drain. Next time,please be more informative about product."
2,Not for medium to big dogs.,"This toy is probably great for smaller dogs. But for medium to big dogs it is not. It got delivered, I took it out of the box, gave it to my dog, and she ripped it apart it 10 minutes. I have a Lab who's 2 so she's on the medium size right now and she made short work of this toy."
2,Not for me.,"I guess I should blame myself for buying a book titled ""Mystical Magical.."" when what I was looking for was a serious book based on facts and experience. In this book dreams are often interpreted as messages from God or memories of past lifes. I am an not a christian nor a hindu, so this is meaningless to me. The dream topic ""cleaning yourself"" can mean you have to ""clean up your act"" and ""driving"" can mean ""you drive yourself"". These interpretions only work for the english language. Being norwegian, this also becoms meaningless to me. It also leads me to think that the author has done little reaserch before writing this book. This book has no credibility and is of little use to me."
5,Better than the title!,"The cover and title make this book seem hokey, but it's actually a very insightful look at how dreamsreveal our subconscious thoughts. The listing of symbolic meanings are thoughtful and meaningful. The interpretations are not random and meaningless magic (""If you dream of a snake it means you will get a new job"") but instead help us see the possibilities inherent in our own symbol-system (""a snake could represent temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, or it could be a phallic symbol, or it could represent danger, slyness, ""a snake in the grass,"" etc.)I've looked at a lot of dream interpretation books, and this one is the most sensible and complete. You have to use the index to find what you want, because the symbols are not listed in one alphabetical list but are organized by topics. But that works."
5,This book is a must for SERIOUS dream analyzers.,"Analyzing dreams is my main hobby, so when I say that this book is the best I've ever seen, you know I'm serious. If you like details, then you want Tanner's dream book. She has included a lot of very common objects that I've yet to find in other dream books, and with excellent,sensible definitions. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is really serious about dream analysis."
5,"The Mystical, Magical, Marvelous World of Dreams",I have been studying dreams seriously since I was a teenager. I have read a lot of books and this book is the BEST AND MOST ACCURATE that I have come across in 30 years. I recommend this book highly for anyone who wants to explore their dreams and find answers. I even have mine tabbed and write notes in it. I have had my book since the mid-90's.
5,Best dream book I have ever owned. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,"I refer to this book almost everyday since I bought it in 1988 or 1989. This is not your typical ""fortune telling"" kind of dream book, such as Zolar's. I have found the symbol definitions to be highly accurate. It's not just a dream dictionary, there are also primers for every chapter to help you interpret your own dreams using the book as a guide.Part 1 is all about dreams themselves. Part 2 is the dictionary, featuring ""definitions,"" more like highly accurate suggestions, for what the object, animal, etc means. Everything from animals to food to sex to transporatation, plants, furniture, illness, jewelry...it goes on and on.If this is your first dream book, and you're looking for a bargain, you could purchase the first edition (1988) and get lots of use out of it, like I do. I also suggest that you keep a dream journal so that you can keep track of your own dream symbols. The author makes room in the book for such entries."
5,The BEST dream interpretation book!,"This is the book I've used for 20+ years to interpret my dreams. I own the 1988 edition, and am on Amazon to see if the newer edition contains updates.Wilda Tanners ""World of Dreams"" has helped me explain the messages in my dreams with extraordinary insight and accuracy. Luckily, I remember my dreams, then make note of them in a dream journal. My dreams are often precognitive in nature, as they are for many of us. It is incredible to read through my past journal entries and see what has actually come about in my ""waking"" life. The analysis I was able to create with the help of this book proved invaluable.I have read other dream books, they don't come close to this one!"
2,Mystical Magical Marvelous World of Dreams,"Informative but not as extensive as I had expected, although the symbols are well grouped Several dream symbols I purchased the book for were not included. Still searching for a dream interpretation book to suit my investigation of the possible meaning of dream symbols."
3,insightful,"Has a definition for just about anything one could dream of, however not as helpful as I would have thought."
2,Need refills,"My daughter, age 4 loved this oven, but I'm disappointed that it only came with enough mixes to make one Twinkie and one Cupcake. If anyone knows how to buy more mixes, let me know. The Hostess company said (I called them) that they were no longer selling them!! It seems ridiculous that this oven is still on the market but no refills are to be found. What a waste of my family's money to buy this oven if there aren't any refills so she can do this again."
2,Not too great,"I could understand this being a fun idea...but I think the recipes need to be better. Obviously you're not going to get a top of the line twinkie or cupcake out of the mixtures provided, but if they could even taste a LITTLE like they should, that would make this even better. And even though I know it's a kids toy, I'm 21, and enjoyed recieving this for Christmas. I was however disappointed with the results. Doughy and gross, and hard to clean! Also, finding the refills for it is SO hard. If you want the real thing, buy it, don't buy this."
5,Excellent lessons for kids...,"How can adults cover every lesson each child needs through life? Start with this series, ""Book of Virtues."" My niece and nephew are 4 & 7 and love them. They are truly terrific videos with loving, calming messages. Their parents prefer this to ""Sponge-Bob"", etc. & the kids always request their 'learning stories.'"
1,One for the shoe box in the back of your closet!,"I had heard Mcelroy perform gospel previous to buying this cd and enjoyed her sound. However, this record is pure 80's sounding noise that I'd soon like to forget. If you still enjoy 80's pop then you might like this. I was personally very disapointed with this CD because she does have an outstanding voice."
1,"""improved"" flavor is bad","I have been a huge fan of Big Red for years. They changed the flavor last year and I cannot stand it at all. It just tastes bad. Hopefully, Wrigley's will bring us Big Red Classic Flavor, but I'm not holding my breath."
1,Big Red Gum Contains Aspartame,"For many years, Big Red and Denteyne were my favorite chewing gums. Both had a wonderfully clean taste that helped to cover up onion and/or garlic breath. However, I noticed an unpleasant bitter taste to the Big Red gum. Every time I chewed it, I got a bad headache. If I had more than one stick, I became dizzy. I actually fell one time. Trying to understand the reason for my falling and dizziness, I looked at the ingredients on the packaging of everything I was eating. Much to my surprise, there was a change in the Big Red ingredients and this gum now contains ASPARTAME. It took me a while to put together the bitter taste with the gum. I do not consume ASPARTAME. I'm now trying to find a gum with real cane sugar and/or stevia. I cannot find a single one? For more information about Aspartame, Google its side effects on the Internet. You may be surprised."
3,Three Witnesses,The rating on this book would be a 3 stars. This is not a bad reading considering if you like fee differentiator stories.
1,Good idea gone bad,"Incomplete songs, it is a shame what the Director did to these great artists. I thought I was buying a concert but all this is advertisement for Legends. Some the artists in this series have not been available previously on DVD. I only hope someday they will be released in concert form so the artists can be truly appreciated. The producer and director should have checked their ego at the door."
3,Potential was there...,"A good editor would have really improved this book.Reading it aloud requires some creative interpretation as the metre is completely wrong all to often. Great illustrations and my son enjoys it, so if you're up for making up your own bits, go for it."
4,"Fun Story, Great Illustrations, Weird Music","This story is great for any kid you want to turn in to a cycling enthusiast. It advocates wearing helmets and, to my husband's great delight, cleaning the bike at the end of the ride.My son loves the story and the illustrations are interesting and fun. I find the music on the CD a little funky but my 3 y.o. likes it."
2,Liked the book but not happy,"We really enjoy reading this book and it has a good lesson to it but were terribly disappointed that there was no CD sent along with the book. The CD is what makes the book. My kids love to listen and sing along to the songs in the car. The condition of the book was NOT in ""good condition"". The pages are all falling out, the binder is broken and were very disappointed with the seller and this purchase."
3,Not exactly what I wanted.,"I chose between this floatie and the one made of stacked foam plates. I chose wrong. The float part is hard plastic, and bumps the kids when they wear it. I have trouble keeping it in place because I don't want to put it on them too tight.It's okay, but I think if I had to do it again, I'd buy the foam model."
1,No LP Mode Here,I can't recommend this VCR. It can not record in the LP mode. LP delivers a much better picture than the EP mode.
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT - NEVER BUY,VERY BAD PRODUCT.DIGUSTING.GEOMETRY IS ALL MESSED UP. I WORK ON 1280 BY 1024 AND MY VERTICAL DISTANCE IS MAXED OUT WITH ATLEAST HALF AN INCH BEFORE THE BORDERS.It always messes up the geometry whenever I restart my computer. I work on GeForce FX 5200 (256 MB AGP) and still this monitor is the most useless product sold in the American markets.I strongly suggest NO ENVISION Monitors.NO WAYNO WAYWasted my money :(Sigh !!
1,The Worst Monitor/company,"DON'T BUY ENVISION MONITORS!!!Especially this model. I've had two. The first one, the power went dead. Then a little after the 3 year warranty expired, the screen goes black and the only thing they offered me was a %15 discount to fix it which costs another $100 plus $50 shipping costs depending where you are(i'm in the same state, California). Thanks to all these other reviews, i'm finding that other people are having similar problems with this company. If I were you, i'd find a company WHO CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! STAY AWAY FROM ENVISION! THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER COMPANY'S IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW TO CHOOSE FROM WHO MAKE QUALITY PRODUCTS AND WILL TREAT YOU RIGHT!DON'T BUY ENVISION!NEVER AGAIN!"
3,Sharp but jittery even at 85Hz,"I bought this monitor instead of an LCD to save money. Yes the resolution goes up to 1200 x 1084 at 85Hz, but it jitters. The screen geometry at any resolution is hopelessly warped at every corner. The color and sharpness are good, but that's about all."
3,arrived a little dinged up,"I received this muffler unboxed, with several dents, and alot of superficial scratches. I have no idea why Amazon would not send this in a box. Overall the muffler is functional, but dissapointed in shipping methods. Bolts right in for 04 Ram 1500. Sounds like OEM."
3,Puzzling features,"Although this VCR was highly rated by Consumers Report, I am disappointed with some of the features. VCR+ Silver - The channel auto set up works, but if you use the VCR+ code, the date, time and length are set correctly, but the channel is always 01. Timer Record - you must turn the VCR off for the timer record to work. This is a major hassle. If you happen to be using the VCR to watch another channel when it's time for a program to record, tough cookies. My previous VCR would switch over to the channel to be recorded while it was on. Set up / entry - You can not use the numeric keypad to enter numeric values in any set up option or timer record. You have to use the left and right arrow keys to decrease / increase number values. Remote - does not have a ""last channel"" button. The channel, volume, and record buttons are tiny. Only the device selection and power button are back lit."
4,"Quality, Affordable VCR","I am very impressed with the quality of this VCR. The picture quality is excellent, it's relatively easy to use, and the numerous A/V jacks definately help since my TV was running out.However, I do have two gripes that keep this VCR from getting 5 stars. One, the Record button on the VCR face is too close to the Stop/Eject button. I've already accidentally recorded a few seconds of random stuff onto a pair of tapes while trying to Eject them. Additionally, the Light Tower remote control seems to completely defy the ease of use characteristic of other Panasonic products. Awkward button placement and the buttons are really small. If you have another multi-function remote, use that instead. I use the remote that came with my Panasonic TV.However, despite these two issues, if you're in the market for a basic Hi-Fi VCR, this should be at or near the top of your list. It's a good price for a great product, and despite some ergonomic shortcomings, the picture is excellent."
4,Great but confusing,"When I purchased this PV-V4620 it was highly recommended by everyone I mentioned it to including my grandson who is a whiz at electronic stuff. Well, after getting it home I was totally confused after reading the instrucions. Panasonic could have done a better job with the instrctions for dummies like me. I know I have a great VCR but if I could only operate it. My grandson is not always available to come over to save me."
2,Psychotic Tracking Problems,"I replaced a seven year old VCR with one of these. I wish I hadn't. Tapes that play perfectly in my other older unit will not track in this one. The only reason I bought it was because it has LP recording mode. As soon as I find something else, preferably another RCA or Proscan, this one's outta here"
1,BUY A SHARP,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. YES, THIS UNIT HAS ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT, WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE. A BIG BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I AM GOING BACK TO MY 2 YEAR OLD SHARP."
4,My thoughts,"When I saw this product, I was truly impressed with the features.So I had to find it and make a purchase. It will be a great addition to my home theater system."
5,Thelma Is Cookin' Red Hot!!!,"Why in the wide, wide world this album never received more air play or recognition is beyond me!!! Produced by the great Richard Perry, diva Thelma Houston has never sounded better since ""Don't Leave Me This Way"". She truly scorches the tracks. If you love Thelma Houston, this CD is a must. Get your hands on it."
4,Throw You Down,"Thelma Houston raised some eyebrows on 1990 when ""Throw You Down"" was released. She still has a soulful, galvanizing voice and she is equally good at fitting into pop, electronic/dance, or R&B contexts. While the album itself is not a great effort and is strictly aimed at the crossover market, it is good. Thanks to the producer Richard Perry, the single ""Out of My Hands"" is one of Houston's Best songs ever. It remains among the better unpublicized gems of the 90's. This album did score a hit with the #5 dance hit ""Throw You Down"". Other singles include ""High"" and the aformentioned ""Out of My Hands"". Styles: Soul, Urban, Club/Dance, Quiet Storm."
3,PUT ON YOUR DANCING SHOES,"While Thelma Houston had one of the biggest hits of the disco era---""Don't Leave Me This Way""---she never achieved the superstar status of her niece, the late Whitney Houston. THROW YOU DOWN was her nineties effort to both rekindle her disco success while adding the recently emerging rap bandwagon. The result is a highly danceable collection buoyed by Houston's spirited and energetic vocals. Carly Simon's bluesy A MAN WHO ISN'T SO SMOOTH is the only deviance from the disco material and is a fine example of Houston's talent.The title track is unabashed fun and infectiously toe-tapping. The rest of the tracks are similarly enticing and make you want to dig out the old spinning mirrorball and dance all night. THROW YOU DOWN is an interesting reminder of those good old disco nights."
1,Sexy Wendie,"Wendie Malick could make reading the back of a cereal box sound sexy. That is why it is such a shame to hear how she was directed on her tune of ""Santa Baby"". Should have been done to a slower tempo with her in a lower register and it would have been great I am sure. I bought this in a bargin bin at the thrift store and bought it only for Wendie (one of the best looking and sexy voiced woman to be found, been a fan of hers for years) and consider it a waste of a buck."
5,Delicious,"Delicious, smooth coffee. No bitterness with a delightful coffee taste. I use it in an espresso pot and my drip coffee maker; however, be aware that if you have a fast running drip coffee maker such as ""Bunn"", this product will not work because it is too finely ground."
2,Not the same quality ads it used to be.,"I used to get this Lavazza as long as I remember in exactly same looking ribbed box like the one of picture listing. Usually form my local farmer's market store down here in Delray, FL. Always same high quality, great deep taste.Recently they ran out of it so I decided to order it through Amazon. What I have received was packed in similar looking but not ribbed can. I thought that they have changed the can shape or graphics little bit as many manufacturers do from time to time. However the coffee lacks of same flavor and taste. I brew it always same way and I can say this is not the Lavazza I used to enjoy for past 25 years. Gotta be either knockout or else. Not recommended."
5,a great mad scientist novel,"Jules Verne was one of the first to write stories about a mad scientist conducting evil or unethical experiments. In this novel, Dr. Ox conducts an experiment driving a small quiet town to the verge of insanity and war. It is an amusing story and a lot of fun."
5,quilts,"excellent program. well photographed with detailed close ups. if you're considering this dvd, order ""a century of quilts"" at the same time."
4,Valuable,"While thoroughly worthwhile, I hesitate to call this the ""definitive"" biography. Coleman tells the Lennon story from his perspective as a British journalist and former acquaintance of John Lennon. As such he is in touch with many valuable sources, and not with others. Perhaps this books should be read in tandem with Albert Goldman's negatively sensational but well-researched biography. The truth may then emerge, for it probably lies somewhere in the middle."
2,David Oistrakh: Artist of the People VHS,The item arrived within a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately it was falsely advertised. The item was described as being like new and still in the package. This VHS is supposed to come with a booklet which was missing. I definitely would not have bought this product from this seller if I knew that it was not complete. There were many other options to choose from and unfortunately I was misled. When I wrote back to let the seller know that I was not satisfied I did not receive a response. I would not recommend this seller.
3,What are we talking about: music or politics?,"Here we have most probably one of the three greatest violinists of the 20th Century - and what are our reviewers write about? Stalin, Zhdanov, Commusnists, KGB... This stuff is dead and gone some 12 years ago, but THE MUSIC and THE ARTISTRY of this great man will live forever! So, let's concentrate and share our views on Oistrakh as a great musician - which he really was! -let's enjoy his great music, and let's forget about those scoundrels which will be remembered in future ONLY because they happened to live at the same time and place with Oistrakh, Kogan, Richter, Gilels, Shafran, Sofronitsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Khachaturian and others GREAT Russian musicians."
5,Why oh why only one album,"The headline says it all, why oh why only one album. Surely it is high time Mark Knopfler gets the group together and makes another album. This CD is brilliant and deserves more attention. Please buy it and encourage the boys to do it again. All the tracks are terrific and well worth the price individually."
2,interesting,"but not very exciting. After the first song it pretty much goes downhill. I guess you need to like this kind of music to appreciate it. I bought this album being a fan of MK, but its not my cup of tea."
5,no salt sardines in olive oil,The benefit of olive oil without the salt--great product! Wish I could get it more often!
5,GOOD PRODUCT,"I WAS SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE, BUT FEEL THAT THE PRICE IS HIGH CONSIDERING YOU ARE BUYING VOLUME."
2,Disappointing stereotypes abound...,"Really disappointed to see the stereotypes this author connects to different styles of shoes. She was totally off the mark on several styles I wear, connecting them to personality traits that aren't even close to how I am. Judging by the other reviews I read, this book may just unfortunately reflect what ""the masses"" assume about certain people who wear certain styles. Sad to say that this book will likely cause wrong impressions and even discrimination against people who wear certain styles by those who read this book and buy into it. Could be a generational thing in that the author makes assumptions that date the book, reflecting a limited age range's view of others. Alarming thing is that readers may give more credence than they realistically should only because of the author's credentials."
5,E?,I'm pretty sure Marc E. Herman isn't the guy who worked on this book. I think Marc E. Herman is a hydrologist or something like that. The co-author of this book is a guy named Marc Herman. But I think his middle name is Robert and he doesn't know all that much about hydrology.Really good book though.
2,Beware of very offensive language,"The town of Steepleton could have dealt with a runaway, a suicide, an abduction, or even a murder. Other towns survive them. But the thing about Chris Creed's disappearance was that he was just plain gone. There was no evidence leading anyone to prove anything specific had happened to him.Torey Adams becomes obsessed with Creed's disappearance because of their friendship. He really doesn't discover anything except that some mysteries are not meant to be solved, but rather just to be overcome.For mature readers only because of very offensive language and adult subject matter (description of having sex)."
2,I can't believe that this was on my 7th grade reading list..,"I was supposed to read this book over the summer of 02, but I could barely finish it. It's awful. Simply about some nerd that goes missing in the woods and one kid that wants to find him. This book was horrible language, containing the somewhat-dreaded 'effword' and many things containing sexual references. It was like a Stephen King wannabe book, and really doesn't pull you in. If you want a good read, pick up ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon."" It's at least the littlest bit suspenseful, and though it's a little over my age group and still says cursewords, it was far better than this dissappointment of a book."
2,A parent's perspective,"This book is on a reading list for 9th grade. I bought it for my son to read and I read it myself. It contains several ""f"" words and several ""a"" words. It also has other offensive language. I don't particularly mind the language, my son has certainly heard it before, but should this be on a 9th grade reading list? I don't think so. Also, the book contains many sexual references and is written from the perspective of an 11th grade student. The author tries to use slang for the teens she writes for but isn't often successful. Terms such as ""crashed out"" for falling asleep don't make sense. The term is ""crashed"". Also, what teen says ""don't wig out""???? The story was predictable and I knew what was going to happen by the time I was half way through. If there are any other books on your child's reading list I would recommend you look to them. My son will probably read this one anyway since I already bought it but I wish I had known about the material beforehand."
2,This is a book?,"This book was horrible. I admit, since it was a mystery, I read it without putting it down for one whole day. But, after I read, I was going to do a report on it and I realized that this book was horrible. The important parts were not described well eough, causing me to make inferences. I hope the author does better with her next book."
4,Hard to Review without Spoilers,This is a hard book to review without giving away the major plot points.Suffice it to say(if you read the book you'll understand that) anyone who lives in small town should read this book!We all know about bullying and outcasts especially in high schol but as you get older you realize its not just high school there are adult bullies and outcasts too.And in a a small town everyone has a secret.I found this book engaging and see why it won so many honor awards.I would venture to say that everyone should read this book!
3,"Suspensful, but good!","The Body of Christopher Creed is a book about a geeky 17-year-old at school. Nobody really ever liked him, nor payed attention to him except for when the bullies beat him up. But one day he suddenly disapears. Now everybody cares just enough to think, ""where is he?"", ""Is he dead"", ""Did he commit suicide?"" Answer these any many more questions as you read this book yourself.I thought this book was pretty good. The author did a great job in keeping you in suspense. the writer sucks you into the book until the end. At the end, you'll find a nice surprise. So overall, I liked it and defintely recommend it to all."
3,"good, but low level","I read this book with my book club in school, and since it was my first time participating, I wasn't really expecting much. But i ended up really liking this book, I thought Torey, the main character was a really great guy, it was easy to feel bad for him and all.So even though the plot was good, there were two things i didn't like. First, this book was for a much lower reading level, and secondly i was not satisfied with an ending.But, in the end, this is a good book for a book club to discuss"
5,Incredibly Exciting and Very Suspenseful,"The ""Body of Christopher Creed"" could possibly go on my all-time favorite mystery book list. The book was suspenseful and chilling from the start of the book to the finish. It was one of those types of books in which I couldn't put down. Every free minute was spend reading this book. Carol Plum-Ucci did a good job in making the book a very intriquing. At times, this book gave me the chills. At the end of each chapter, I was left hanging and wanting to read more to see what happened next. I recommend this book to readers who are especially interested in mystery books."
4,Loved it! - Ending fell short.,"How did I not read this sooner?? Loved the story and the strong characters. Sadly the ending fell short and was WAY too abrupt, causing it to loose a star in my book. HIGHLY recommend."
3,Not Bad Book,"This book was the first that my school's book club read. It was rather slow for me and by the time I got to the middle I felt like we should've been wrapping it up. I did get in to the story and it did take me away from my surroundings to the setting the author created. Though it was probably 100 pages long than necessary and was definitely a cliff hanger, the end of the book was really deep and insightful and there were lots of lessons to be learned. However, for as many hundreds of pages as I read, I deserved a better conclusion than that. Even if the main characters didn't find Christopher, I deserved to know what happened."
5,A Dream in Torey's Shoes,"If you are looking for a book to put you in anothers persons shoes and change your life with the character in incredable experiences this is your book! It is a red hairing horrog storyk, with suspense and life lessons.Reading this book you will learn that your smallest mean actions cna affect others lives drasticallly. This can lad other s ot do extreme things, like killing others or themself. If any one you see is always being bullied and taunted, become their friend. Help them. You moght be saving their life."
5,Breathtaking...,"I absolutely loved What Happened to Lani Garver, so I decided to check out this book by Plum- Ucci. The Body of Christopher Creed is definitely on my top 5 list of books that I've read (and that's out of a LOT of books, believe me...)Anyway, I won't give away the ending, but when you get there, you don't know whether to laugh or cry, be happy or sad. It's a book that fills you with all kinds of emotions. (Some parts scared the cra p out of me!) What this book is NOT is a murder mystery. Characters don't find and decipher clues, blah blah blah. It's not a mystery novel, which is good.Anyway, I'm a pretty bad reviewer, but I promise, you'll enjoy this book. I couldn't put it down, and it was finished in one day. (It's kind of long.) Even if you aren't a fan of reading, you NEED to read this book. It's not hard to follow, and it's sooo great."
2,Disappointing,"Not the best book. I really don't understand all the five-star reviews. It's unrealistic. The character development is weak. The theme is the only thing that gives it strength. But no matter how good the theme is, you still need the other elements to be strong for the book to be good. I don't get it. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the language is not an accurate reflection of how teens talk."
1,This Book Rocks Because...,"I found this book to be very good. The reason I thought this was because it has a great story line of mystery, adventure, and action. It also has a great them to it. The theme came out to me as that you can't hang over something for a long time because if you do it will only drive you insane, adn make you mad at yourself and the world.I thought that this book was good and all, but I could'nt really focus on it after about 20 pages. So I read around a chapter or two every other night or so.The easiest aprt for me to read was toward the end of the book because thats when it got really exciting and the mystery startd to unfold.I think that this book is excellent for anyone who enjoys mystery stories. This book is also i think good for teenagers because this story is fiction, but a situation like this book could very well happen to any teenagers life."
4,A Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Love the ""The Body of CHris Creed"" is a really good book. I couldn't stop reading it. I am so glad it was a choice in our class."
4,"for Older Teens, Young Adults",I bought this book to give to my 14 year old nephew and was pretty surprised when I started to read it by the language and dark edge it has as well as the talking about 'doing the nasty' with mention of the sounds etc. All this is alright but people should know that it is a bit raw and cynically oriented (like an adult's book!).
2,Misleading Advertising,"My principal issue with this product is the misleading way it is described as ""for the auto or home"", when in fact, a separate, expensive and difficult to find, kit is required to use the product in the home. The other problem is the weakness in signal amplification in the auto: I find it necessary to turn the radio volume almost to the maximum level to acheive reasonable volume. This means that when you revert to normal radio usage, you will be blasted out of the car if you forget to adjust the volume.I also have an issue with Sirius' advertising claims of ""commercial-free"". There are in fact frequent commercials for Sirius radio among the music and the sports channels are ""commercial-OD""!"
2,"Sirius content great, but the hardware is shoddy.","I love the content, but that's not what I'm reviewing here.This unit is shoddy and extremely fragile. I've already had to replace the antenna and the power jack, which both frayed or broke through gentle, normal use. And now, the the power jack is starting to jiggle again, losing power if the radio is moved at all. It's especially annoying - the power doesn't just cut out - the radio takes a moment to come back online and find the signal, so it cuts out for a WHILE."
4,Babylon Sisters: A Love Story Without All The Mush,"Pearl Cleage does it again! She successfully puts into words those emotions that are all too common to most of us. Surprisingly, she is able to speak not only for the women characters, but for the men as well. Babylon Sisters is a love story without all of the mush. What I liked most about this book was the complexity of the characters - they have layers and the more you find out about each one, the more believable the character becomes. This book would make a great birthday gift to a friend. If you're a fast reader you can finish this in one weekend."
3,ENTERTAINING TALE,"THIS BOOK WAS ENTERTAINING, THE STORY-LINE WAS INTERESTING THE CHARACTERS HAD SOME DIMENSION, BUT OVERALL THE STORY WAS MARGINAL AT BEST. I WILL SAY THAT THE AUTHOR'S READING VOICE WAS CLEAR WITH APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION, AND THIS IS ALWAYS A BIG PLUS FOR ME WITH AN AUDIO BOOK. TRUST ME, WHEN THE READER'S VOICE IS DEEP AND THE RECORDING IS TOO LOW(AS WITH TONI MORRISON)LISTENING CAN BE ALMOST PAINFUL - I PERSIST BECAUSE IT'S TONI. PEARL'S EXCELLENT READING VOICE IS A HUGE BENEFIT TO HER. BOTTOM LINE, I'D BUY ONE OF HER AUDIOBOOKS AGAIN IF I WANTED SOME LIGHT LISTENING."
3,Babylon Sisters,"Enjoyable, easy to read story about secrets and lies. Cassandra is single mother who is keeping the identity of her daughter's father a secret and is in search of job in order to pay for her daughter's college tuition. Cassandra is offered a job with Mandeville Maids and while uncovering a cover-up, guess who comes to town? Good lazy-day reading. A solid 3 star."
3,A little clumsy,"This was a slow and confusing read. I like the sisterhood concept. I read ""Red Dress"" by this author and walked away with the same impression that the book was slow, moved all around and had no real direction. I wish you much success with your next projects.To the reviewer Angela of Imani, I read your review on ""Flyy Girl,"" by Omar Tyree. As you say that you are a teacher of 27 years, I am surprised by your lack of understanding character development. You must first realize that the characters all have their OWN personalities. The profanity and sexual scenes were all character driven. Mr. Tyree was only telling their stories and giving us a glimpse into their lives. Mr. Tyree is only the writer, not the characters. Now with this information, perhaps you will better understand character personalities and not be so hasty to false accusations."
3,Interesting Read,"I brought the cd ""Babylon Sisters"" whihc was read the author Pearl Cleage. Listening to the Cd was fantastic. I was able to picture the novel in my mind's eye. I enjoyed the twist in the book (and I'm not about the give this away - you will have to read or listen to the cd for yourselves). The only constructive cristism I have is that I was a little disappointed by the ending. In my opinion although the story ended on a high - I feel the author could and should have written a chapter about the relationship between Cat and BJ.It was a pity that Sam disappeared half way through the novel; it would have been interesting to hear about his relationship with Ezola. Also I would have liked to hear about what happened when Ezola was arrested. On the whole however I enjoyed the book."
5,Babylon Sisters- A great book and a good read!!!,"Pearl Cleage's Babylon Sisters is my favorite type of fiction book: one that I can curl up on the couch with and lose myself in for hours. It doesn't fail to satisfy. I won't rehash the storyline, but the story was great (no dry spots, thank goodness!) and quite original and refreshing. The story moved along very smoothly, but I especially like the fact that most of the drama was saved until the very end. As a matter of fact, I laughed out loud at the final sentence of the last chapter!I like books where the author pulls characters from a previous book and brings them forward into the new book. Pearl Cleage does that here, with the brief appearences of Blue and Regina Hamilton from her previous book Some Things I Never thought I'd do.If you're looking for a book that is enjoyable, but also makes you think, with a good positive storyline and themes of black empowerment and love for community, this book is definitely a must read!"
2,Surprisingly Disappointed.,"The title of the story doesn't match its content. It should be called ""Trials of a Mother/Daughter Relationship"". The storyline was really very boaring and the characters are ""RECYCLED"" from Til You Hear From Me. I chose this book as the topic of discussion for our girlfriends getaway, everyone agreed the book fell way short of expectations..."
3,sloooooowww......,This is an OK book...kind of humdrum. It took awhile to get through it because I kept putting it down but I finally finished.
3,sisters of circumstance,"Pearl Cleage is one of the greatest writers of our time. No one can dispute that. From plays like ""Blues for an Alabama Sky"" to books like Baby Brother's Blues, she can light up a page and spark your imagination. I liked Babylon Sisters. It's definitely not her strongest work. Try What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do and Baby Brother's Blues which gets 10 stars from me - each!Also remember some of the books are sequels and it helps to read them in order! Happy Reading!What Looks Like Crazy on An Ordinary DayI Wish I Had a Red Dress (sequel to the above)Some Things I Never Thought I'd DoBaby Brother's Bluse (sequel to the above)"
4,"Outstanding, Something out of the Ordinary","This is my first Pearl Cleage book and it won't be my last. The story doesn't have the typical urban fiction storyline its got a lot more to offer. The end is far from predictable. The chapters are short and the book is a quick and easy read. Cleage kept things moving from the beginning to the end. The book offers everything romance, drama, and a good discussion of immigration politics. If you want something out of the ordinary read this book.The book is about Catherine Sanderson an advocate for immigrant woman and her daughter seventeen year old daughter Phoebe. The relationship between Phoebe and her mother grows rocky when she fails to reveal who her father is. But the main story line is about Catherine and her new job for Miss Mandeville. While working for Miss Mandevile Catherine learns about a female slave ring. Things quickly heat up as she uncovers more and more about immigrant women being sold and used as prostitutes."
2,Were no angels,It was sadly disappointing.I rented it because Robert de Niro and Sean Penn was in it. But after 30 minutes I just stoped watching it.
4,"I Haven't Watched It Yet But Robert De Nero, How Could It Possibly Be Bad.","I really wanted the 1955 Bogart film but guess my once dexterous fingers are significantly less dexterous now, oppsI really can offer no objective view until it finds a spot on the hard drive and rely on my belief in Robert De Nero's choice of scripts."
1,"Waste of time, talent, film, you name it!","Save your money. Save your time. This movie makes Ishtar seem bearable. If you have not seen the original film of 'We're No Angels' - whose cast was better than this version's by the way, and the script far surpassed this dud, then find a copy of the original. It's got Humphrey Bogart and Peter Ustinov - two of the best reasons I know for watching a movie - along with the inimitably villainous Basil Rathbone and the bumbling likeable Leo G. Carroll (aka Mr. Waverly in 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'). Sean Penn left comedy behind with Ridgmont High and can't seem to find that magic again. Robert DeNiro is certainly capable of comedy but first he needs a truly funny script. Everyone has something they don't want on their resume, and I'd guess that for both actors it's this movie."
5,I Never Saw The Original,"I don't know anything, but I know what I like. This was Hoyt Axton's last performance on film, and for that alone, it ought to be worth a look. Demi Moore puts in a reasonably amusing performance as a single mom with a mute daughter, who will do anything to make ends meet, and the utter implausibility of the whole film makes me want to watch it over and over again for some reason. I like the grittiness of this period piece, and to tell you the truth, I laughed out loud several times (although probably at all the wrong times and for all the wrong reasons) I enjoyed this film for what it was; a decent piece of work with a lot of good character actors, an otherworldly quality that intrigued me, and some familier faces that I will never see together again, on this side of the veil. Hope this helps."
3,not as horrendous as some say,"Its only a little bit funny , but it is touching in an unusual way . Sean Penn is great and so is Bob , but the film slows down a bit in the middle and Bob growls his lines too much . But this is watchacle and entertaining if you have patience and a light heart ."
3,A Watchable Film,"This is simply another film that I had seen years ago, a film that I wanted to add to my DVD collection that began not all that long ago."
1,Time misspent,"I have been a big fan of the original film starring Bogart, Ustinov, Ray and Rathbone, so I approached this with some trepidation. But, I thought, how could DeNiro and Penn possibly fail when Mamet was involved? Arrgggh! This film ranks only second to ""Ishtar"". The acting is wooden, the writing is hackneyed and the direction misguided...and it proved that Demi Moore wasn't an actress even 10 years ago let alone now. Not one truly enjoyable moment in the whole production. The cinemtography is the only saving grace; a keen eye for space and composition. This film lacks soul and humor. The two things that made the original so engaging You would be better of spending your $ on the 1955 original. There is nothing better than watching Ray ogle the daughter of the shopkeeper, Bogart selling a much-too-small suit or Ustinov pine for ""...the delicious fat woman."""
1,Deceptive Seller,"The seller (shivser / tavas) is dishonest. The description says ""new"" but the product sent me was used. It was very dirty with food crumble stuck under keys, the back of the keyboard was rusted and the cable broken."
1,I wouldn't have given it even 1 star if they gave that option,"The product arrived overnight as requested, but it is obviously used, not new. There are particles of stuff all in the keys and the ""F"" and ""J"" keys actually show dirt on them - yuck. PLUS, there are two ""O"" keys and no ""I"" key. It types ""I"" but it has an ""O"" on the key. Amazon should really not allow this company to sell its products on their website if they are going to sell them under false pretenses!!!"
1,Do not buy!,"Seller was deceptive IMO - said nothing about it being a used keyboard. Had many hairs, dirt/gunk lodged throughout the keyboard. The keyboard functions, but this was for a client, and it needed to look presentable, which, in my opinion, did not."
1,Horrible,"I Purchased this keyboard from ZEETRON though Amazon. They state that there keyboard was NEW, which was clearly not by all the dirt and grim in the keys. I had to send three different keyboards back, due to them not fully functioning."
2,"U/S out of the box, probably not new","The keyboard in question had black paint around the keys that was chipped and the shiny metal showed through, even when installed. I don't think that it was new. When installed it stopped working and I have to shut down using the on/off button. Also one of the metal tabs to secure the keyboard to the computer was bent a bit and had to be straightened. You probably can do just as well on e-Bay."
1,Used and defective,The keyboard that arrived was clearly used (it had spots and crumbs on the keys). The keyboard was damaged - The rubber assembly over the power switch was ripped off making it impossible to turn the laptop on after the keyboard was installed.
1,Dell Keyboard,"Received keyboard, but it was the wrong model. Returned unit, but have still not received it. Still waiting on replacement."
5,Perfect Replacement Keyboard,"Arrived quickly, in perfect condition, packaged safely and securely without wasting packing materials. Exactly the right part for my laptop. Plugged it in, and off we go! No issues at all. What more could you want?"
1,Not a very happy camper,":-(I received the keyboard about two months ago and installed it right away as my old one lost an ""A"" key and it was bugging me. About a week ago the new keyboard had the ""TAB"" and ""FUNCTION"" keys fall off. after only 7 or 8 weeks and for a new item I was not happy about this. As I'm working out of the country, it doesn't make sense to pay shipping which will amount to the same cost as the keyboard so I just didn't bother pursuing it with the seller."
3,"Well, at least it's working","The keyboard was seemingly new on arrival, but I looked at it closer and realized it had been handled quite a bit. It works fine, I just had to pop the Page Dn key back on, but it's a lot louder and quite annoying while trying to work on it late at night, or early in the morning. The seller isn't honest, but it's a satisfactory replacement."
2,"It works, but its DIRTY! grossly dirty.","I bought this keyboard as a replacement because my old keyboard was dying, power button wasnt working, neither were the volume buttons, and every single letter didnt work with the exception of the letter P, yes this fixed it, BUT! it's DIRTY!! some of the keys randomly stick, theres hairs and food under the keyboard, some of them are pet hairs, and id like to try to clean it out but its too risky destroying any keys or the clips. im pleased, it just couldve been clean atleast."
3,Second time the charm,"The keyboard was original Dell OEM. It fit and the second one shipped is working. The keyboard shipped from it's vendor, Pacific Tek, in a plain manila envelope with a folded piece of cardboard around it. The packaging was insufficient. It didn't even say ""do not bend"" on it. The USPS must have dropped something on it, or otherwise bent it, because it had a definite curl to it. In addition the C key would not work.The vendor was very nice about it. They immediately sent another keyboard, and sent me a return label for the old one. I kept asking them to pack the second one more securely, but when it showed it, the packaging was identical. I think it ships from a fulfillment house.In any event, though it took an extra week, my laptop is returned to service."
3,Working Keyboard,"The keyboard works as advertised, it is used but it works great. The only issue is the that the ""T"" button is a different color than the rest, but that doesn't affect the functionality of the keyboard which is what really matters."
2,Cute but cheaply made,"I bought this stroller for my youngest daughter who is 2 years old. She loves to play babies with her two older sisters so I thought that the ""Little Mommy"" items would be great for her. She loves having her own baby items (we also have the swing) but I have been very disappointed with the quality of the toy. The wheels often fall off while she is trying to push the stroller and any of the poles used for support also fall off often. I wish they would come up with something that snaps together and stays there. The swing is also very flimsy and the poles that hold the top on just slide right out causing the swing to fall apart when she tries to get her doll out. I am usually very satisfied with Fisher-Price toys but not in this case. I am planning on getting one of the Graco strollers for her for Christmas. They are much more durable, larger, and they look just like the ones real mom's use!!"
2,Don't waste your money on this,"I was extremely disappointed with this stroller. My 19 month old daughter has the Little Mommy doll, and loves to use her older sister's doll stroller, so I thought I'd get her one of her own. It is cute, and goes together easily. However, it's not designed well. The Little Mommy doll is almost too big for the stroller. The velcro strap is difficult for a 4year old to fasten. The wheels do not roll well, and the stroller base is too close to the ground - there's not enough clearance room. It's difficult to push on any kind of surface that has any height (plush carpet, grass). We've also had a problem with one of the wheels popping off. My older daughter's stroller was a different brand, was cheaper, rolls much easier on all different surfaces, and has held up well."
4,cute stroller!!!,"My daughter has played with this stroller for over a year now, and it's still holding up. Occasionally the bar at the bottom of the backside will unsnap or the wheels will pop off, but it's not a huge deal as they pop right back in. All in all, it has been a good toy...."
3,the missing wheel,My three year old received this stroller for christmas. She loved it so much that two days ago I went out a bought her the matching carrier. But today when we got out her baby doll things I realized the wheel was missing. I have spent most of the day trying to find it with no luck. Now I am online researching to find a better one and wishing I hadn't bought the matching carrier.
3,Good for tiny tots,"I bought the Little Mommy Stroller for my 13 month old granddaughter and it is the perfect size for her and she is tiny. I can't imagine a four year old being interested in this stroller, way too small and flimsy. The picture on the box is misleading. But, still my granddaughter took to it right away and put her stuffed animals in for a ride. She's just starting to walk so it helped her get around on her own."
2,Keep Looking!,"As soon as I took this out of the box and put it together I could see how cheaply made it was. My daugter just turned 2 and it is perfect size for her, but she won't be able to use it for long because it is so tiny, so if your child is older I would avoid this stoller. Also the velcro straps keep coming out and she is too little to work them properly. If the ""baby"" isn't strapped in, she just falls out and that frusterates her. Also, you can only put a very small baby or stuffed animal in here because the straps are so small. We are going to try the Graco one and take this back!"
2,Flimsy,"My kids (ages 3 and 1) loved playing with this toy. They would get easily frustrated through as it is hard to push around (wheels do not turn very easily). It is also pretty flimsy. It would probably be an okay toy for an older kid if they still like playing with that sort of thing. However, for my two little ones, they tried to sit in the stroller themselves and bent the plastic legs on the stroller. I am now looking for a sturdier toy stroller for them. [...]."
2,Not happy with this product,"We purchased this stroller, and my daughter finds it extremely frustrating that her doll keeps falling out. The fastening belt got lost early on, and the seat is not deep enough for the doll to sit. I would not recommend this product."
5,Little Mommy Stroller,I purchased this for my granddaughter who just turned 2 years old. She loves to push things and I wanted to get her one that was appropriate for her age. Most doll strollers say 3 yrs old and up. This was for 2 year olds. It is just perfect for her. A snap to assemble and she just loves it and it never topples over. I have purchased 2 Little Mommy Dolls and she loves them also. Product is exactly as it appears. So glad I purchased it.
1,Not a good choice,"I purchase this stroller for my daughter, and ended up returning it before she ever even saw it. The baby doll would NOT stay in the stroller. It kept sliding out. If you strapped her in, she would have stayed, but I thought that might be a little challenging for a two-year old. So, I saved myself and her the frustration and returned the stroller. I'm still on the lookout for a better one."
3,It's ok for a started!!,"I brought this stroller for my daughter for christmas. She had just turned 2, and she loved it!!! It is now 7 months later and I'm thinking of getting her a more grown-up stoller, like the GRACO. She is still playing with it, but is getting a bit too tall for it. The front wheel does come off from time to time, but it's easy to pop back on. Overall it was an ok stroller for a toddler."
2,waste of money,I purchased this stroller for my two year old who loves her baby dolls. We quickly found that it was a waste of money. It's made very cheaply and the seat easily comes apart. It is also very unstable and may cause little ones to fall if they lean on it at all. The only good thing about it is it's size. A lot of the other doll strollers are made for older/larger children. This one is a good size for a two year old.
4,Not recommended for a child over 2 or a small 3,"I bought this stroller for my daughter when she was 4. I was pretty disappointed in how cheaply it was made and how small it was. I haven't had problems with the wheels or the seatbelt like others have but have had the white cross bar fall off repeatedly so I just took it off. My daughter had no problem strapping her dolls or stuffed animals in (as long as they were small, it won't fit average sized dolls) but the stroller is so small that my daughter has to crouch over to push it. It is so frustrating for her that I took it away and bought her one of those umbrella strollers. This would be a good first stroller for a 1 or 2 year old, or a very small 3 year old but any child older or bigger would be disappointed."
